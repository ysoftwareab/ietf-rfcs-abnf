   normal operating conditions, and the use of a Pre-emption mechanism
   to tear-down some of the flows to bring the PCN traffic level down to
   a desirable amount during unexpected events such as network failures,
   with the goal of maintaining the QoS assurances to the remaining
   flows.  In [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture], Admission and Pre-
   emption use two different markings and two different metering
   mechanisms in the internal nodes of the PCN region.  This draft
   proposes a mechanism using a single marking and metering for both
   Admission and Pre-emption, and presents a preliminary analysis of the
   tradeoffs.  A side-effect of this proposal that a different marking
   and metering Admission mechanism than that proposed
   [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] may be also feasible.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background and Motivation

   Pre-Congestion Notification [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture]
   approach proposes to use an Admission Control mechanism to limit the
   amount of real-time PCN traffic to a configured level during the
   normal operating conditions, and to use a Pre-emption mechanism to
   tear-down some of the flows to bring the PCN traffic level down to a
   desirable amount during unexpected events such as network failures,
   with the goal of maintaining the QoS assurances to the remaining
   flows.  In [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture], Admission and Pre-
   emption use different two different markings and two different
   metering mechanisms in the internal nodes of the PCN region.
   Admission Control algorithms for variable-rate real-time traffic such
   as video have traditionally been based on the observation of the
   queue length, and hence re-using these technques and ideas in the
   context of pre-congestion notification is highly attractive, and
   motivated the virtual-queue-based marking and metering approach
   specified in [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] for Admission.  On
   the other hand, for Pre-emption, it is desirable to know how much
   traffic needs to be pre-empted, and that in turn motivates rate-based
   Pre-emption metering.  This provides some motivation for employing
   different metering algorithm for Admission and for Preemption.

   Furthermore, it is frequently desirable to trigger Pre-emption at a
   substantially higher traffic level than the level at which no new
   flows are to be admitted.  There are multiple reasons for the
   requirement to enforce a different Admission Threshold and Preemption
   Threshold.  These include, for example:

   o  End-users are typically more annoyed by their established call
      dying than by getting a busy tone at call establishment.

   o  There are often very tight (possibly legal) obligations on network
      operators to not drop established calls.

   o  Voice Call Routing often has the ability to route/establish the
      call on another network (e.g., PSTN) if it is determined at call
      establishment that one network (e.g., packet network) can not
      accept the call.  Therefore, not admitting a call on the packet
      network at initial establishment may not impact the end-user.  In
      contrast, it is usually not possible to reroute an established
      call onto another network mid-call.  This means that call
      Preemption can not be hidden to the end-user.

   o  Preemption is typically useful in failure situations where some
      loads get rerouted thereby increasing the load on remaining links.



Charny, et al.           Expires April 18, 2007                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           PCN with Single Marking            October 2006


      Because the failure may only be temporary, the operator may be
      ready to tolerate a small degradation during the interim failure
      period.

   o  A congestion notification based Admission scheme has some inherent
      inaccuracies because of its reactive nature and thus may
      potentially over admit in some situations (such as burst of calls
      arrival).  If the Preemption scheme reacted at the same Threshold
      as the Admission Threshold, calls may get routinely dropped after
      establishment because of over admission, even under steady state
      conditions.

   These considerations argue for meetering for Admission and Pre-
   emption at different traffic levels and hence, implicitly, for
   different markings and metering schemes.

   Different marking schemes require different codepoints.  Thus, such
   separate markings consume valuable real-estate in the packet header,
   especially scarce in the case of MPLS Pre-Congestion Notification
   [I-D.davie-ecn-mpls] .  Furthermore, two different measurement/
   metering techniques involve additional complexity in the datapath of
   the internal routers of the PCN domain.

   To this end, [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] proposes an
   approach, referred to as implicit pre-emption marking, that does not
   require separate pre-emption marking.  However, it does require two
   separate measurement schemes: one measurement for Admission and
   another measurement for Preemption/Dropping.  Furthermore, this
   approach mandates that the configured preemption rate be set to a
   drop rate.  This approach effectively uses dropping as the way to
   convey information about how much traffic can fit under the
   preemption limit, instead of using a separate preemption marking.
   This is a significant restriction in that it results in preemption
   only taking effect once packets actually get dropped.

   This document presents an approach that allows the use of a single
   PCN marking and a single metering technique at the internal devices
   without requiring that the dropping and pre-emption thresholds be the
   same.  This document also investigates some of the tradeoffs
   associated with this approach.

1.2.  Terminology

   o  Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN): two algorithms that determine
      when a PCN-enabled router Admission Marks and Pre- emption Marks a
      packet, depending on the traffic level.

   o  Admission Marking condition- the traffic level is such that the
      router Admission Marks packets.  The router provides an "early
      warning" that the load is nearing the engineered admission control
      capacity, before there is any significant build-up in the queue of
      packets belonging to the specified real-time service class.

   o  Pre-emption Marking condition- the traffic level is such that the
      router Pre-emption Marks packets.  The router warns explicitly
      that pre-emption may be needed.

   o  Configured-admission-rate - the reference rate used by the
      admission marking algorithm in a PCN-enabled router.

   o  Configured-pre-emption-rate - the reference rate used by the pre-
      emption marking algorithm in a PCN-enabled router.

   o  CLE - congestion level estimate computed by the egress node by
      estimating as the fraction of admission-marked packets it
      receives.

   o  PIN - PCN internal node - an internal node in the PCN region.

   o  PEN - PCN edge node - an ingree or egress edge node of the PCN
      region.


2.  The Single Marking Approach

2.1.  High Level description

   The proposed approach is based on several simple ideas:

   o  Replace virtual-queue-based marking for Admission Control by
      excess rate marking:

      *  meter traffic exceeding the Admission Threshold and mark excess
         traffic (e.g. using a token bucket with the rate configured to
         Admission Rate Threshold)

      *  at the edges, stop admitting traffic when the fraction of
         marked traffic for a given edge-to-edge aggregate exceeds a
         configured threshold (e.g. stop admitting when 3% of all
         traffic in the edge-to-edge aggregate received at the ingress
         is marked)

   o  Impose a PCN-region-wide constraint on the ratio between the
      Admission threshold on a link and Pre-emption threshold on that
      link (e.g. pre-emption threshold is 20% higher than Admission



Charny, et al.           Expires April 18, 2007                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           PCN with Single Marking            October 2006


      threshold on all links in the PCN region)

   o  The edge PCN device determines whether Pre-emption level is
      reached anywhere in the network by measuring the amount of
      unmarked traffic (assuming the marked traffic actually is above
      the threshold triggering blocking admission), i.e. the traffic
      that did not get admission marked.  This is analogous to the
      notion of sustainable pre-emption rate in
      [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] .

   The remaining part of this section gives more detailed of a possible
   operation of the system.

2.2.  Operation at the PIN

   The PCN Internal Node (PIN) meters the aggregate PCN traffic and
   marks the excess rate.  A number of implementations are possible to
   achieve that.  A token bucket implementation is particularly
   attractive because of its relative simplicity, and even more so
   because a token bucket implementation is readily available in the
   vast majority of existing equipment.  The rate of the token bucket is
   configured to correspond to the target Admission rate, and the depth
   of the token bucket can be configured by an operator based on the
   desired tolerance to PCN traffic burstiness.

   Note that no preemption threshold is explicitly configured at the
   PIN, and the PIN does nothing at all to enforce it or mark traffic
   based on Pre-emption threshold.

2.3.  Operation at the Egress PEN

   The PCN Egress Node (PEN) measures the rate of both marked and
   unmarked traffic on a per-ingress PEN basis, and reports to the
   ingress PEN two values: the rate of unmarked traffic from this
   ingress PEN, which we deem Sustainable Admission Rate and the
   Congestion Level Estimate (CLE), which is the fraction of the marked
   traffic received from this ingress PEN.  Note that Sustainable
   Admission Rate is analogous to the sustainable pre-emption rate of
   [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture], except in this case it is based
   on the admission threshold rather than pre-emption threshold, while
   the CLE is exactly the same as that of
   [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture].  The details of the rate
   measurement are outside the scope of this draft.

2.4.  Operation at the Ingress PEN

Internet-Draft           PCN with Single Marking            October 2006


2.4.1.  Admission Decision

   Just as in [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture], the admission
   decision is based on the CLE.  The ingress PEN stops admission of new
   flows if the CLE is above a pre-defined threshold (e.g. 3%).  Note
   that although the logic of the decision is exactly the same as in the
   case of [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture], the detailed semantics
   of the marking is different.  This is because the marking used for
   admission in this proposal reflects the excess rate over the
   admission threshold, while in the marking is based on exceeding a
   virtual queue threshold.  Notably, in the current proposal, if the
   average sustained rate of admitted traffic is 5% over the admission
   threshold, then 5% of the traffic is expected to be marked, whereas
   in the context of [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] a steady 5%
   overload should eventually result in 100% of all traffic being
   admission marked.  A consequence of this is that for smooth traffic,
   the approach presented here will not mark any traffic at all until
   the rate of the traffic exceeds the configured admission threshold by
   the amount corresponding to the chosen CLE threshold.  At first
   glance this may seem to result in a violation of the pre-congestion
   notification premise that attempts to stop admission before the
   desired traffic level is reached.  However, in reality one can simply
   embed the CLE level into the desired configuration of the admission
   threshold.  That is, if a certain rate X is the actual target
   admission threshold, then one should configure the rate of the
   metering device (e.g. the rate of the token bucket) to X-y where y
   corresponds to the level of CLE that would trigger admission blocking
   decision.  A more important distinction is that virtual-queue based
   marking reacts to short-term busrtiness of traffic, while the excess-
   rate based marking is only capable of reacting to rate violations at
   the timescale chosen for rate measument.  Whether this distinction is
   sufficiently important for the case when no actual queuing is
   expected even if the virtual queue is full is an open question, which
   we attempt to start answering in the performance evaluation presented
   at the end of this draft.

2.4.2.  Pre-emption Decision

   When the ingress observes a non-zero CLE and Sustainable Admission
   Rate Ra, it first computes the Sustainable Pre-Emption rate Rp by
   simply multiplying Ra by the system-wide constant u, where u is the
   system-wide ratio between pre-emption and admission thresholds on all
   links in the PCN domain: Rp = Ra*u.  The ingress PEN then performs
   exactly the same operation as is proposed in
   [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] with respect to Rp, namely, it
   pre-empts the appropriate number of flows to ensure that the rate of
   traffic it sends to the corresponding egress PEN does not exceed the
   sustainable pre-emption rate Rp.  Just as in the case of



Charny, et al.           Expires April 18, 2007                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           PCN with Single Marking            October 2006


   [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture], an implementation may decide to
   slow down the pre-emption process by preempting fewer flows than is
   necessary to cap its traffic to Rp by employing a variety of
   techniques such as safety factors or hysteresis.  In summary, the
   operation of pre-emption at the ingress PEN is identical to that of
   [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture], with the only exception that the
   sustainable pre-emption rate is computed from the sustainable
   admission rate rather than derived from a separate marking.  This is
   enabled by imposing a system-wide restriction on the pre-emption-to-
   admission thresholds ratio and changing the semantics of the
   admission marking.


3.  Discussion

3.1.  Benefits

   The key benefits of using a single metering/marking scheme for both
   Admission and Preemption presented in this document are summarized
   below:

   o  Reduced implementation requirements on core routers due to a
      single metering implementation instead of two different ones.

   o  Ease of use on existing hardware: given that the proposed approach
      is particularly amenable to a token bucket implementation, the
      availability of token buckets on virtually all commercially
      available routers makes this approach especially attractive.

   o  Reduced number of codepoints which need to be conveyed in the
      packet header.  If the PCN-bits used in the packets header to
      convey the congestion notification information are the ECN-bits in
      an IP core and the EXP-bits in an MPLS core, as is currently
      proposed in [put marking draft reference here] and
      [I-D.davie-ecn-mpls], those are very expensive real-estate.  The
      current proposals need 5 codepoints, which is especially important
      in the context of MPLS where there is only a total of 8 EXP
      codepoints which must also be shared with Diffserv.  Eliminating
      one codepoint considerably helps.

   o  A possibility of using a token-bucket-, excess-rate- based
      implementation for admission provides extra flexibility for the
      choice of an admission mechanism, even if two separate markings
      and thresholds are used.

3.2.  Tradeoffs and Issues

   While the benefits of the proposed approach are attractive, there are
   several issues and tradeoffs that need to be carefully considered.

3.2.1.  Restrictions on Pre-emption-to-admission Thresholds

   An obvious restriction necessary for the single-marking approach is
   that the ratio of 9implicit) pre-emption and admission thresholds
   remains the same on all links in the PCN region.  While clearly a
   limitation, this does not appear to be particularly crippling, and
   does not appear to outweigh the benefits of reducing the overhead in
   the router implementation and savings in codepoints.

3.2.2.  Performance Implications and Tradeoffs

   Replacement of a relatively well-studied queue-based measurement-
   based admission control approach by a cruder excess-rate measurement
   technique raises a number of algorithmic and performance concerns
   that need to be carefully evaluated.  For example, a token-bucket
   excess rate measurement is expected to be substantially more
   sensitive to traffic burstiness and parameter setting, which may have
   a significant effect in the case of lower levels of traffic
   aggregation, especially for variable-rate traffic such as video.  In
   addition, the appropriate timescale of rate measurement needs to be
   carefully evaluated, and in general it depends on the degree of
   expected traffic variability which is frequently unknown.

   In view of that, an initial performance comparison of the token-
   bucket based measurement is presented in the following section.
   Within the constraints of this preliminary study, the performance
   tradeoffs observed between the queue-based technique suggested in
   [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] and a simpler token-bucket-based
   excess rate measurement do not appear to be a cause of substantial
   concern for cases when traffic aggregation is reasonably high at the
   bottleneck links as well as on a per ingress-egress pair basis.
   Details of the simulation study, as well as additional discussion of
   its implications are presented in section 4.

   Also, one mitigating consideration in favor of the simpler mechanism
   is that in a typical DiffServ environment, the real-time traffic is
   expected to be served at a higher priority and/or the target
   admission rate is expected to be substantially below the speed at
   which the real-time queue is actually served.  If these assumptions
   hold, then there is some margin of safety for an admission control
   algorithm, making the requirements for admission control more
   forgiving to bounded errors - see additional discussion in section 4.

   Note that an implication of the above that even if two markings and
   two metering mechanisms are used, these consideration may imply that
   an excess-rate token bucket implementation of admission metering and
   marking may be feasible, which could be a benefit for existing
   equipment routinely supporting a token-bucket implementation.

3.2.3.  Effect on Proposed Anti-cheating Mechanisms

   Replacement of the queue-based admission control mechanism of
   [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] by an excess-rate based admission
   marking changing the semantics of the pre-congestion marking, and
   consequently interfereres with mechanisms for cheating detection
   discussed in [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-border-cheat].  Implications
   of excess-rate based marking on the anti-cheating mechanisms need to
   be considered.

3.2.4.  Standards Implications

   The change of the meaning of admission marking for pre-congestion
   notification from the queue-based to excess-rate marking poses a
   question of coexistence of devices having different interpretation of
   admissions marking (and hence different metering and marking
   mechanisms in the core.  The question of how and if the two
   mechanisms can co-exist in one PCN region has obvious impact on
   standardization efforts, and needs to be carefully considered.


4.  Performance Evaluation Comparison

4.1.  Relationship to other drafts

   Initial simulation results of admission and pre-emption mechanisms of
   [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] were reported in
   [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-phb].  A follow-up study of these mechanisms is
   presented in a companion draft
   draft-zhang-cl-performance-evaluation-00.txt.  The current draft
   concentrates on a preliminary performance comparison of the admission
   control mechanism of [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-phb] and the token-bucket-
   based admission control described in section 2 of this draft.

4.2.  Limitations, Conclusions and Direction for Future Work

4.2.1.  Limitations

   Due to time constraints, the study performed so far was limited to a
   single bottlneck case.  The key questions that have been investigated
   are the comparative sensitivity of the two schemes to parameter
   settings and the effect of traffic burstiness and of the degree of

   aggregation on a per ingress-egress pair on the performance of the
   admission control algorithms under study.  The study is limited to
   the case where there is no packet loss.  While this is a reasonable
   initial assumption for an admission control algorithm that is
   supposed to maintain the traffic level significantly below the
   service capacity of the corresponding queue, nevertheless future
   study is necessary to evaluate the effect of packet loss.

   This draft does not discuss performance of the pre-emption algorithm,
   as it does not differ between the approach described in this draft
   and that of draft [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture].

4.2.2.  High Level Conclusions

   The results of this (preliminary) study indicate that there is some
   potential that a reasonable complexity/performance trafdeoff may be
   viable for the choice of admission control algorithm.  In turn, this
   suggests that using a single codepoint and metering technique for
   admission and pre-emption may be a viable option warranting further
   investigation.

   The key high-level conclusions of the simulation study comparing the
   performance of queue-based and token-based admission control
   algorithms are summarized below:

   1.  At reasonable level of aggregation at the bottleneck and per
       ingress-egress pair traffic, both algorithms perform reasonably
       well for the range of traffic models considered (see section 4.3.
       for detail).

   2.  Both schemes are stressed for small levels of ingress-egress pair
       aggregation levels (e.g. a single video-like bursty VBR flow per
       ingress-egress pair).  However, while the queue-based scheme
       results in tolerable performance even at low levels of per
       ingress-egress aggregation, the token-bucket-based scheme is
       substantially more sensitive to parameter setting than the queue-
       based scheme, and its performance for the high rate bursty
       "video-like" traffic with low levels of ingress-egress
       aggregation is quite poor unless parameters are chosen carefully
       to curb the error.

   3.  Even for small per ingress-egress pair aggregation, reasonable
       performance across a range of traffic models can be obtained for
       both algorithms (with a narrower range of parameter setting for
       the token-bucket based approach) .

   4.  The absolute value of round-trip time (RTT) or the RTT difference
       between different ingress-egress pair within the range of

       continental propagation delays does not appear to have a visible
       effect on the performance of both algorithms.

4.2.3.  Future work

   This study is but the first step in performance evaluation of the
   token-bucket based admission control.  Further evaluation should
   include a range of investigation, including the following:

   o  a study in the multiple bottleneck case

   o  a wider range of topologies and traffic matrices

   o  fairness issues (how different ingress-egress pairs get access to
      bottleneck bandwidth)

   o  interactions between admission control and preemption

   o  effect of loss of marked packets

   o  much more


5.  Appendix A:  Simulation Details

5.1.  Network and Signaling Model

   Simulations presented in this document are limited to a single
   bottleneck case.  The network is modeled as either Single Link or
   Multi Link Network shown in the figures below.  (We termed the latter
   "RTT").

   Figure A.2: Simulated Multi Link Network.

   Figure A.1 shows a single link between an ingress and an egress node,
   all flows enter at node A and depart at node B. In Figure A.2, A set
   of ingresses (A,B,C) connected to an interior node in the network
   (D).  The number of ingresses varied in different simulation
   experiments in the range of 2-100.  All links have generally
   different propagation delays, in the range 1ms - 100 ms.  This node D
   in turn is connected to the egress (F).  In this topology, different
   sets of flows between each ingress and the egress converge on the
   single link D-F, where pre-congestion notification algorithm is
   enabled.  The capacities of the ingress links are not limiting, and
   hence no PCN is enable on those.  The bottleneck link D-F is modeled
   with a 10ms propagation delay in all simulations.  Therefore the
   range of round-trip delays in the experiments is from 22ms to 220ms.
   Our simulations concentrated primarily on capacities of 'bottleneck'
   links with sufficient aggregation - OC3 for voice and for "video-
   like" traffic, up to 1 Gbps.  In the simulation model, a call
   requests arrive at the ingress and immediately sends a message to the
   egress.  The message arrives at the egress after the propagation time
   plus link processing time (but no queuing delay).  When the egress
   receives this message, it immediately responds to the ingress with
   the current Congestion-Level-Estimate.  If the Congestion-Level-
   Estimate is below the specified CLE-threshold, the call is admitted,
   otherwise it is rejected.  An admitted call sends packets according
   to one of the chosen traffic models for the duration of the call (see
   next section).  Propagation delay from source to the ingress and from
   destination to the egress is assumed negligible and is not modeled.

5.2.  Traffic Models

   Three types of traffic were simulated (CBR voice, on-off traffic
   approximating voice with silence compression, and on-off traffic with
   higher peak and mean rates (we termed the latter "video-like" as the
   chosen peak and mean rate was similar to that of an mpeg video
   stream, although no attempt was made to match any other parameters of
   this traffic to those of a video stream).  The distribution of flow

Internet-Draft           PCN with Single Marking            October 2006


   duration was chosen to be exponentially distributed with mean 2min,
   regardless of the traffic type.  In most of the experiments flows
   arrived according to a Poisson distribution with mean arrival rate
   chosen to achieve a desired amount of overload over the configured-
   admission-limit in each experiment.  Overloads in the range 2x to 5x
   and underload with 0.95x have been investigated.  For on-off traffic,
   on and off periods were exponentially distributed with the specified
   mean.  Traffic parameters for each flow are summarized below:

5.2.1.  CBR Voice (CBR)

   o  Average rate 64 Kbps

   o  Packet length 160 bytes

   o  packet inter-arrival time 20ms

5.2.2.  VBR Voice (VBR)

   o  Packet length 160 bytes

   o  Long-term average rate 21.76 Kbps

   o  On Period mean duration 340ms; during the on period traffic is
      sent with the CBR voice parameters described above

   o  Off Period mean duration 660ms; no traffic is sent during the off
      period.

5.2.3.  High Rate ON-OFF traffic with Video-like  Mean and Peak Rates
        ("Video")

   o  Long term average rate 4 Mbps

   o  On Period mean duration 340ms; during the on-period the packets
      are sent at 12 Mbps (1500 byte packets, packet inter-arrival: 1ms)

   o  Off Period mean duration 660ms

5.3.  Parameter Settings

5.3.1.  Queue-based settings

   All the queue-based simulations were run with the following Virtual
   Queue thresholds:






Charny, et al.           Expires April 18, 2007                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft           PCN with Single Marking            October 2006


   o  virtual-queue-rate: configured admission rate, 1/2 link speed

   o  min-marking-threshold: 5ms at virtual-queue-rate

   o  max-marking-threshold: 15ms at virtual-queue-rate

   o  virtual-queue-upper-limit: 20ms at virtual-queue-rate

   At the egress, the CLE is computed as an exponential weighted moving
   average (EWMA) on an interval basis, with 100ms measurement interval
   chosen in all simulations.  We simulated the weight ranging 0.1 to
   0.9.  The CLE threshold is chosen to be 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, and 0.5.

5.3.2.  Token Bucket Settings

   The token bucket rate is set to the configured admission rate, which
   is half of the link speed in all experiments.  Token bucket depth
   ranges from 64 to 512 packets.  Our simulation results indicate that
   depth of token bucket has no significant impact on the performance of
   the algorithms and hence, in the rest of the section, we only present
   the result with 64 bucket depth.

   The CLE is calculated in the same way as in queue-based approach with
   weights from 0.1 to 0.9.  The CLE thresholds are chosen to be 0.0001,
   0.001, 0.01, 0.05.  Note that the meaning of tthe CLE is different
   for the Token bucket and queue-based algorithms, so there is no
   direct correspondence between the choice of the CLE thresholds in the
   two cases.

5.4.  Simulation Details

   To evaluate the performance of the algorithms, we recorded the actual
   admitted load at a granularity of 100ms, from which the mean admitted
   load over the duration of the simulation run can be computed.  We
   verified that the actual admitted load at any time does not deviate
   much from the mean admitted load in each experiment by computing the
   coefficient of variation (CV is consistently 0.06 for CBR, 0.13 for
   VBR and 0.6 for Video for all experiments).  Finally, the performance
   of the algorithms is evaluated using a metric called over-admission-
   percentage, which is calculated as a percentage difference between
   the mean admitted load and the configured admission rate.  Given
   reasonably small deviation of the admitted rate from the mean
   admitted in the experiments, this seems reasonable.

5.4.1.  Queue-based Results

   We found that virtual-queue admission control algorithm works
   reliably with the range of parameters we simulated, for all three

   types of traffic.  In addition, for both CBR and VBR traffic, the
   performance is insensitive to the parameters change.  Table A.1
   summarized the over-admission-percentage values from 32 experiments
   with different [weight, CLE threshold] settings.  The overload column
   represents the ratio of the demand on the bottleneck link to the
   configured admission threshold.  While in our simulations we tested
   the range of overload from 0.95 to 5, we present here only the
   results of the endpoints of this overload interval.  For the
   intermediate values of overload the results are even closer to the
   expected than at the two boundary loads, The statistics show that for
   CBR and VBR traffic these over-admission-percentage values are rather
   similar, with the admitted load staying within -2%+2% range of the
   desired admission threshold, with quite limited variability across
   the experiments (see the Standard Deviation column)

   Table A.2 Over-admission-percentage for "Video"

   It follows from these results that while performance is tolerable
   across the entire range of parameters, choosing the CLE and EWMA
   weights in the middle of the tested range appear to be more
   beneficial for the overall performance across the chosen range of
   overload, assuming the chosen values for the remaining parameters.
   The high level conclusion that can be drawn from Table A.2. is that
   (predictably) high peak-to-mean ratio video-like traffic is
   substantially more stressful to the queue-based admission control
   algorithm, but a set of parameters exists that keeps the
   overadmission within about -3% - +10% of the expected load even for
   the bursty video-like traffic.  Note that for vide-like traffic these
   results hold even though there is no aggregation at all on a per-
   ingress-egress pair in the chosen RTT topology there is only a single
   "video" flow per ingress.

5.4.2.  Token Bucket-based Results

   Compared to the virtual queue based algorithms, token bucket-based
   admission control algorithm shows substantially higher sensitivity to
   the parameter settings for the over-load conditions (overload greater
   than 1) Under the under-loaded conditions for voice-like CBR and VBR
   traffic the sensitivity to the tested parameters remains limited for

   the token-bucket as well (the latter is summarized in Table A.3).

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
   Table A.3 Summarized performance for CBR and VBR across different
   settings for under-loaded conditions.

   Table A.4 shows over-admission-percentage for different settings.  It
   is important to note here that for the token bucket-based admission
   control no traffic will be marked until the rate of traffic exceeds
   the configured admission rate by the chosen CLE.  As a consequence,
   even with the ideal performance of the algorithms, the over-
   admission-percentage will not be 0, rather it is expected to equal to
   CLE threshold if the algorithm performs as expected.  Therefore, a
   more meaningful metric for the token-based results is actually the
   over-admission-percentage (listed below) minus the corresponding (CLE
   threshold * 100).  For example, for CLE = 0.05, one would expect that
   5% overadmission is inherently embedded in the algorithm, with the
   algorithm by design reacting to 5% overload (or more) only.  Hence,
   with CLE = 0.05 a 10% over-admission in the token-bucket case should
   be compared to a 5% overadmission in the queue-based algorithm.  When
   comparing the performance of token bucket (with the adjusted over-
   admission-percentage) to its corresponding virtual queue result, we
   found that token bucket performs only slightly worse for voice-like
   CBR and VBR traffic.

   However the results for Video-like traffic require some additional
   commentary.  Note from the results in Table A.4. that even for video-
   like traffic, in the Single Link topology the performance of the
   token-based solution is comparable to the performance of the queue-
   based scheme in table A.2, (adjusted by the CLE as discussed above).
   However, for the RTT topology, especially for the larger EWMA
   weights, the performance for "video" traffic becomes very bad, with
   up to 48% (adjusted by CLE) over-admission in a high overload
   situation (5x).  We investigated two potential causes of this drastic
   degradation of performance by concentrating on two key differences
   between the Single Link and the RTT topologies: the difference in the

   round-trip times and the degree of aggregation in a per ingress-
   egress pair aggregate.

   To investigate the effect of the difference in round-trip times,we
   also conducted a subset of the experiments described above using the
   RTT topology that has the same RTT across all ingress-egress pairs
   rather than the range of RTTs in one experiment.  We found out that
   neither the absolute nor the relative difference in RTT between
   different ingress-egress pairs appear to have any visible effect on
   the over-load performance or the fairness of both algorithms (we do
   not present these results here as their are essentially identical to
   those in Table A.4).  In view of that and noting that in the RTT
   topology we used for these experiments for the video-like traffic,
   there is only 1 highly bursty flow per ingress, we believe that the
   severe degradation of performance in this topology is directly
   attributable to the lack of traffic aggregation on the ingress-egress
   pair basis.  We also note that even for this highly challenging
   scenario, it is possible to find a range of parameters that limit the
   overadmission case for video traffic to quite a reasonable range of
   -3% + 10% (adjusted by the CLE).  Luckily, these are the same
   parameter settings that work quite well for the other types of
   traffic tested.
