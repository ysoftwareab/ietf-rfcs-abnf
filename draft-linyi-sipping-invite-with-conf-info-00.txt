1.  Introduction

   RFC XXX {URI List Conferencing} [2] defines a mechanism for UAC to
   provide a conference server with the initial set of participants to
   address the specific need as follow: 'some environments have tough
   requirements regarding conference establishment time'.  With respect
   to this kind of consideration, this specification further defines a
   mechanism for UAC to be able to provide the conference server with
   the initial conference information and policy.  This specification
   also provides a mechanism for Conference Server to relay the
   conference infromation and policy to the new participants being
   invited to allow them be aware of the information regarding this
   conference at the beginning.

   The mechanism defined in this specification can be used either
   standalone or together with other mechanisms, e.g.  URI-List
   conferencing mechanism.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3]

   This document uses the conferencing terminology defined in RFC 4353
   [8] "conferencing Framework".

3.  Requirements Analysis

   some environments have tough requirements regarding conference
   establishment time.  This is true especially when a user wants to
   create a conference in ad hoc manner.  In addition user may only want
   very simple conference information and policy, for example the
   subject and maximum numbers of participants, to be provided for an ad
   hoc conference via only one operation.  In this case they rarely
   desire to manipulate the conference policy during the conference.

   In current art there is no mechanism for new participants to be aware
   of the conference information they are being invited to.  It causes
   difficulty for them to decide whether to accept this invitation which
   may not fall into their interest.

   The requirements to support invitation with conference info may be
   summarized as follows:

      REQ 1: The conference mechanism MUST allow the invoker to provide
      the Conference Server with the initial conference information and
      policy in order to create an ad-hoc conference.

      REQ 2: The conference mechanism MUST allow the Conference Server
      to relay the conference information and policy to new participants
      being invited.

4.  INVITE: Sending conference info to Conference Server

   RFC 4575 [4] defines a conference event package for tightly coupled
   conferences using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events
   framework, along with a data format used in notifications for SIP
   specific conferencing.  RFC XXX {XCON Data Model} [5] extends the
   data format to support more call signaling protocols besides SIP and
   cover the functionality defined in the XCON conferencing framework.
   A sub-set of both data formats can be used to represent conference
   information and policy, e.g. <conference-description> and <maximum-
   user-count>.

   The conference information and policy can be included in the body of
   initial SIP INVITE request to create an ad-hoc conference.  Hence it
   can be included in the follow-up SIP INVITE requests to allow new
   participants being invited to be aware of.

4.1.  Conference Info Format

   The sub set of data format defined in RFC 4575 [4] and extended in
   RFC XXX {XCON Data Model} [5] can be used to represent the conference
   info and policy which could be carried in SIP INVITE method.  The
   amount of data MUST be limited to avoid overload of SIP message.

4.1.1.  Conference Info Format derived from Conference State Package

   Following is the sub set of data format defined in RFC 4575 [4]
   representing the conference information and policy.

   The 'state' and 'version' attributes SHOULD NOT be used.  Other
   elements defined in RFC 4575 [4] SHOULD NOT be included in initial
   SIP INVITE request since they would be generated by the Conference
   Server, but MAY be included in follow-up SIP INVITE requests to new
   participants.

4.1.2.  Conference Info Format derived from XCON Data Model

   Following is the sub set of data format defined in RFC XXX {XCON Data
   Model} [5] representing the conference information and policy.

   included in initial SIP INVITE request since they would be generated
   by the Conference Server, but MAY be included in follow-up SIP INVITE
   requests to new participants.

4.2.  UAC Procedures

   A UAC that wants to include the initial conference information and
   policy in its initial INVITE request MUST add a body whose
   disposition type is 'conference-info' as defined in section xxx of
   this specification.  Additionally, the UAC MUST include the
   'conference-info-invite' option-tag, which is registered with the
   IANA in Section xxx in a Require header field.  The UAC sends this
   INVITE request to the conference factory URI.

   A 200 (OK) response means that the conference was created
   successfully, that the UAC that generated the INVITE request is in
   the conference, and that the server understood the conference
   information.

4.2.1.  re-INVITE Request Generation

   The previous section has specified how to include the conference
   information in an initial INVITE request to a conference server.
   Once the INVITE-initiated dialog between the UAC and the Conference
   Server has been established, the UAC can send re-INVITE requests to
   the conference server to, modify the characteristics of the media
   exchanged with the server.

   At this point, there are no semantics associated with conference info
   bodies in re-INVITE requests(although future extensions may define
   them).  Therefore, UACs SHOULD NOT include conference info bodies in
   re-INVITE requests sent to a conference server.

4.3.  Conference Server Procedures

   Conference Server that is able to receive and process INVITE requests
   with a 'conference-info' body MUST include a 'conference-info-invite'
   option-tag in a Supported header field when responding to OPTIONS
   requests.

   On reception of an INVITE request containing a 'conference-info' body
   as described in Section 3, a conference server MUST follow the rules
   described in RFC 4579 [1] to create ad-hoc conferences.  Once it is
   requested to add new participants into this specific conference, the
   Conference Server MUST attempt to relay the conference info which may
   be manipulated to the new participants being invited using an INVITE-
   contained conference info.

Internet-Draft         invite with conference info            April 2007


   If the conference server includes conference info in an outgoing
   INVITE request, it MUST include a Content-Disposition header field
   (which is specified in RFC 2183 [6] ) with the value set to
   'conference-info-history' and a 'handling' parameter (as specified in
   RFC 3204 [7] ) set to "optional".

   If <maximum-user-count> element presents, the conference server MUST
   reject the requests to add new participants to the conference when
   the number of participants has reached the number specified in this
   element.

4.3.1.  re-INVITE Request Handling

   At this point, there are no semantics associated with conference info
   bodies in re-INVITE requests (although future extensions may define
   them).  Therefore, a Conference Server receiving a re-INVITE request
   with a conference info body and, consequently, a 'conference-info-
   invite' option-tag, following standard SIP procedures, rejects it
   with a 420 (Bad Extension), which carries an Unsupported header field
   listing the 'conference-info-invite' option-tag.

      This is because the resource identified by the conference URI does
      not actually support this extension.  On the other hand, the
      resource identified by the conference factory URI does support
      this extension and, consequently, would include the 'conference-
      info-invite' option-tag in, for example, responses to OPTIONS
      requests.

5.  INVITE: Sending URI-List with conference info to Conference Server

   The mechanism defined in section 4 of this specification can be used
   together with other mechanisms, e.g.  URI-List conferencing mechanism
   defined in RFC XXX {URI List Conferencing} [2] .  The initial INVITE
   request can carry a 'multipart/mixed' body composed of three bodies:

   o  'application/sdp' body: describes the session;

   o  'application/resource-lists+xml' body: describes the list of
      target URIs;

   o  'application/conference-info+xml' body: contains the conference
      information.

   The UAC MUST ensure the number of URIs in the URI-List will not
   exceed the number specified in <maximum-user-count> element if it
   presents.  The UAC and Conference Server MUST follow the procedures
   defined in RFC XXX {URI List Conferencing} [2] and section 4 of this
   specification respectively.

6.  Example

6.1.  Creation of Conference with initial Conference Info

   Figure 3 shows an example of ad-hoc conference creation with initial
   conference information and policy.  A UAC sends an INVITE request F1
   that contains SDP body and conference info to the Conference Server.
   The Conference Server answers with a 200 (OK) response.  Then
   Conference Server is requested to add new participant Bob to the
   specified conference using REFER method.  The UAC sends a REFER
   request F3 to the conference URI with a Refer-To containing the URI
   of Bob. The Conference Server sends an INVITE request F7 to Bob
   containing the manipulated conference info.  Then Bob can know the
   information of this specific conference when he receives the request
   F3, such as subject and conference presentations,and decides to join
   it.

   Figure 5 shows an example of the INVITE request F7, which carries a
   'multipart/mixed' body composed of two other bodies:

   o  'application/sdp' body: describes the session;

   o  'application/conference-info+xml' body: contains the conference
      information.  This body may not equal to the 'application/
      conference-info+xml' body in the initial INVITE request F1 because
      the Conference Server may manipulate it.  Elements other than
      those listed in section 4.1 may present in manipulated conference
      info.  For example the Conference Server can fill the "entity"
      attribute of <conference-info> with appropriate conference URI.
      It can also add <conference-state>,<users>, etc.

6.2.  Creation of a Conference with initial URI-List and Conference Info

   Figure 6 shows an example of ad-hoc conference creation with initial
   URI-List and conference info.  A UAC sends an INVITE request F1 that
   contains initial participants list and conference info to the
   Conference Server.  The Conference Server answers with a 200 (OK)
   response.  Then Conference Server generates an INVITE request to each
   of the participants identifies by the URIs included in the URI-list.
   The Conference Server includes a manipulated URI-list and conference
   info in each of the outgoing INVITE requests.
