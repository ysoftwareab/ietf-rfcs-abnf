Abstract

   This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace that
   is engineered by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) for naming
   persistent resources published by the OGC.  The formal 
   Namespace  identifier (NID) is "ogc".
   

1. Introduction

   The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) produces many kinds of technical 
   documents, including: specifications, working drafts, technical 
   reports, discussion papers, and XML schemas. The OGC wishes to 
   provide persistent, location-independent identifiers for these 
   resources.

Internet-Draft        A URN namespace for the OGC          February 2007

   
   The core mission of the OGC is to develop spatial interface 
   specifications that are openly available and royalty free. Products 
   and services that conform to OGC interface specifications enable users
   to freely exchange and process spatial information across networks,
   computing platforms, and products.  Interoperability in such an
   environment is facilitated by the use of a system of persistent
   identifiers that are global in scope.

   Motivated by these concerns, the OGC would like to assign formal 
   URNs to published resources in order to provide persistent, 
   location-independent identifiers for them. The process for 
   registering a namespace identifier is documented in RFC 3406 [2].

   The official IANA registry of URN namespaces is available online:
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces>.

2. URN Specification for "ogc" NID

   Namespace ID:

      The NID "ogc" is requested.

   Registration Information:

      Registration Version Number: 1
      Registration Date: 2007-2-26

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (Headquarters)
      35 Main Street, Suite 5
      Wayland, MA 01778-5037, USA
      c/o Carl Reed (creed@opengeospatial.org)


   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the "ogc"
      NID will have the following structure:

         urn:ogc:{OGCresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}

      where the "OGCresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the
      URN syntax requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class of
      resource type.  Each resource type has a specific labeling scheme
      that is covered by "ResourceSpecificString", which also conforms
      to the naming requirements of [RFC2141].

      The OGC maintains a naming authority, the OGC Naming Authority
      (ONA), that will manage the assignment of  "OGCresources" and the
      specific registration values assigned for each resource class.

Internet-Draft         A URN namespace for the OGC            February 2007



   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      The OGC Naming Authority (ONA) provides information on the
      registered resources and the registrations for each. More information 
      about ONA and the registration activities and procedures to be followed
      are available at:

         http://www.opengeospatial.org/ona

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      The ONA will manage resources using the "ogc" NID and will be the
      authority for managing the resources and subsequent strings
      associated.  In the associated procedures, ONA will ensure the
      uniqueness of the strings themselves or shall permit secondary
      responsibility for management of well-defined sub-trees.

      OGC may permit use of experimental type values that will not be
      registered.  As a consequence, multiple users may end up using the
      same value for separate uses.  As experimental usage is only
      intended for testing purposes, this should not be a real issue.

   Identifier persistence considerations:


      ONA will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of
      the "ogc" NID.  This will be structured such that each OGCresource
      will have a separate description and registration table.

      The registration tables and information will be published and
      maintained by ONA on the OGC web site.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      ONA will use the approved OGC standards policies and procedures for
      discussion, approval and registration of each type of resource that it 
      maintains (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=12586)
      Each such resource may have three types of registration activities:

         1) Registered values associated with OGC specs or services
         2) Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities
         3) Name models for use in experimental purposes

   Process for identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
      [RFC2141] apply.

Internet-Draft         A URN namespace for the OGC         February 2007  

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      implemented in support of ONA activities.

   Scope:

      Global

3. Examples

      The following examples are representative urns that could be 
      Assigned by ONA.  They may not be the actual strings that would 
      be assigned.
         
         urn:ogc:specification:gml:doc-is(02-023r4):3.00

      Defines the urn to be used to identify a specific version of an OGC
      specification document for the Geography Markup Language in the OGC
      document archives.
         
         urn:ogc:serviceType:CatalogueService:2.0:HTTP
         
      Defines the urn to be used for an application to specify the 
      specific service type for an OGC Catalogue service.

         urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.3:26986

      Is the URN defined to reference the definition of the Coordinate
      Reference System (CRS) with code 26986 that is specified in version
      6.3 of the EPSG database.

    4.0 Namespace Considerations:

      There is currently no available namespace that will allow the OGC
      to uniquely specify and access resources, such as schemas and
      registries, that are required by organizations implementing OGC
      standards. There is also a need for other standards organizations,
      such as OASIS and the IETF to be able to access OGC specific
      resources.

   5.0 Community Considerations
      Many of the current OGC standards require access to resources,
      such as schemas, registries, catalogues, OGC documents, and OGC 
      enabled services. In order for the larger IT community to be
      able to effectively implement applications that access OGC 
      resources, a unique namespace is required. We desire these

Reed                   draft-creed-ogc-urn-01.txt               [Page 4]
Internet-Draft         A URN namespace for the OGC         February 2007
    

      resources to be freely and openly available as a set of
      community resources.

6. Security Considerations

     There are no additional security considerations other than those
     normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
