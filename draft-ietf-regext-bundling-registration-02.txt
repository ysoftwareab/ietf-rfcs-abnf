                      Strict Bundling Registration
               draft-ietf-regext-bundling-registration-02

Abstract

   This document describes an extension of Extensible Provisioning
   Protocol (EPP) domain name mapping for the provisioning and
   management of strict bundling registration of domain names.
   Specified in XML, this mapping extends the EPP domain name mapping to
   provide additional features required for the provisioning of bundled
   domain names.

1.  Introduction

   Bundled domain names are those which share the same TLD but whose
   second level labels are variants, or those which has identical second
   level labels for which certain parameters are shared in different
   TLDs.  For example, Public Interest Registry, request to implement
   technical bundling of second level domains for .NGO and .ONG.  So we
   have two kinds of bundled domain names.  First one is in the form of
   "V-label.TLD" in which the second level labels (V-label) are variants
   sharing the same TLD; Second one is in the form of "LABEL.V-tld" in
   which the second level labels(LABEL) are same ending with the
   different TLDs (V-tld);

   There are several kinds of bundling.  First one is strict bundling,
   which requires all bundled names to share many same attributes.  When
   creating, updating, or transfering of any of the bundled domain
   names, all bundled domain names will be created, updated or
   transferred.  Second one is partial bundling, which requires that at
   least the bundled domain names if registered should be registered by
   the same registrant.  Third one is relax bundling, which has not
   specific requirements to the domain registration.  This document
   mainly focus on strict bundling names registration.

   For the name variants, some registries adopt the policy that variant
   IDNs which are identified as equivalent are allocated or delegated to
   the same registrant.  For example, the specified registration policy
   of Chinese Domain Name (CDN) is that a registrant can apply an
   original CDN in any forms: Simplified Chinese (SC) form, Traditional
   Chinese (TC) form, or other variant forms, then the corresponding
   variant CDN in SC form and that in TC form will also be delegated to
   the same registrant.  All variant names in the same TLD contain same
   attributes.

   The basic Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) domain name mapping
   [RFC5731] provides the domain name registration one by one.  It does
   not specify how to register the strict bundled names which share many
   same attributes.

Internet-Draft          EPP bundled names Mapping           October 2017


   In order to meet above requirements of the strict bundled names
   registration, this document describes an extension of the EPP domain
   name mapping [RFC5731] for the provisioning and management of bundled
   names.This document is specified using the Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) 1.0 as described in [W3C.REC-xml-20040204]  and XML Schema
   notation as described in [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028]  and
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].

   The EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730] provides a complete
   description of EPP command and response structures.  A thorough
   understanding of the base protocol specification is necessary to
   understand the extension of mapping described in this document.

   This document uses lots of the concepts of the IDN, so a thorough
   understanding of the IDNs for Application (IDNA, described in
   [RFC5890], [RFC5891], and [RFC5892]) and a thorough understanding of
   variant approach discussed in [RFC4290] are both required.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   uLable is defined in [RFC 5890]. uLabel is expressed in this document
   as a number of characters with the format of U+XXXX where XXXX is a
   UNICODE point.

   "b-dn-1.0" in this document is used as an abbreviation for
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:b-dn-1.0.

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
   represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a REQUIRED feature of this specification.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented to develop a conforming implementation.

3.  Definitions

   The following definitions are used in this document:

   o  Registered Domain Name (RDN), represents the valid domain name
      that users submitted for registration by the first time.





Kong, et al.             Expires April 29, 2018                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          EPP bundled names Mapping           October 2017


   o  Bundled Domain Name (BDN), represents the bundled domain name
      produced according to the bundled domain name registration policy.

4.  Overview

   Domain registries have traditionally adopted a registration model
   whereby metadata relating to a domain name, such as its expiration
   date and sponsoring registrar, are stored as properties of the domain
   object.  The domain object is then considered an atomic unit of
   registration, on which operations such as update, renewal and
   deletion may be performed.

   Bundled names, brought about the need for multiple domain names to be
   registered and managed as a single package.  In this model, the
   registry typically accepts a domain registration request (i.e.  EPP
   domain <create> command) containing the domain name to be registered.
   This domain name is referred to as the RDN in this document.  As part
   of the processing of the registration request, the registry generates
   a set of bundled names that are related to the RDN, either
   programmatically or with the guidance of registration policies, and
   place them in the registration package together with the RDN.

   The bundled names share many same properties, such as expiration date
   and sponsoring registrar, by sharing one domain object.  So when
   users update any property of a domain object within a bundle package,
   that property of all other domain objects in the bundle package will
   be updated at the same time.

5.  Requirement for Bundling Registration of Names

   The bundled names whether they are in the form of "V-label.TLD" or in
   the form of "LABEL.V-tld" should share some parameter or attributes
   assoicated with domain names.  Typically, Bundled names will share
   the following parameters or attributes:
   o Registrar Ownership
   o Registration and Expiry Dates
   o Registrant, Admin, Billing, and Technical Contacts
   o Name Server Association
   o Domain Status
   o Applicable grace periods (Add Grace Period, Renewal Grace Period,
   Auto-Renewal Grace Period, Transfer Grace Period, and Redemption
   Grace Period)

   Because the domain names are bundled and share the same parameters or
   attributes, the EPP command should do some processing for these
   requirements:
   o When performing a domain check, either BDN or RDN can be queried
   for the EPP command, and will return the same response.

Internet-Draft          EPP bundled names Mapping           October 2017


   o When performing a domain info, either BDN or RDN can be queried,
   the same response will include both BDN and RDN information with the
   same attributes.
   o When performing a domain Create, either BDN or RDN will be
   accepted.  If the domain name is available, both BDN and RDN will be
   registered.
   o When performing a domain Delete, either BDN or RDN will be
   accepted.  If the domain name is available, both BDN and RDN will be
   deleted.
   o When performing a domain renew, either BDN or RDN will be accepted.
   Upon a successful domain renewal,both BDN and RDN will have their
   expiry date extended by the requested term.  Upon a successful domain
   renewal, both BDN and RDN will conform to the same renew grace
   period.
   o When performing a domain transfer, either BDN or RDN will be
   accepted.  Upon successful completion of a domain transfer request,
   both BDN and RDN will enter a pendingTransfer status.  Upon approval
   of the transfer request, both BDN and RDN will be owned and managed
   by the same new registrant.
   o When performing a domain update, either BDN or RDN will be
   accepted.  Any modifications to contact associations, name server
   associations, domain status values and authorization information will
   be applied to both BDN and RDN.

6.  Object Attributes

   This extension defines following additional elements to the EPP
   domain name mapping [RFC5731].  All of these additional elements can
   be got from <domain:info> command.

6.1.  RDN

   The RDN is an ASCII name or an IDN with the A-label [RFC5890] form.
   In this document, its corresponding element is <b-dn:rdn>.  An
   optional attribute "uLabel" associated with <b-dn:rdn> is used to
   represent the U-label [RFC5890] form.  An optional boolean
   "activated" attribute, with a default true value, is used to indicate
   the presence of the label in the zone file.

   For example: <b-dn:rdn uLabel="U+5B9E""U+4F8B".example> xn--
   fsq270a.example</b-dn:rdn>

6.2.  BDN

   The BDN is an ASCII name or an IDN with the A-label [RFC5890] form
   which is converted from the corresponding BDN.  In this document, its
   corresponding element is <b-dn:bdn>.  An optional attribute "uLabel"

Internet-Draft          EPP bundled names Mapping           October 2017


   associated with <b-dn:bdn> is used to represent the U-label [RFC5890]
   form.

   For example: <b-dn:bdn uLabel="U+5BE6""U+4F8B".example> xn--
   fsqz41a.example</b-dn:bdn>

7.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use in provisioning and
   managing bundled names via EPP.

7.1.  EPP Query Commands

   EPP provides three commands to retrieve domain information: <check>
   to determine if a domain object can be provisioned within a
   repository, <info> to retrieve detailed information associated with a
   domain object, and <transfer> to retrieve domain-object transfer
   status information.

7.1.1.  EPP <check> Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <check> command or
   <check> response described in the EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731].
   However, when either RDN or BDN is sent for check, response SHOULD
   contain both RDN and BDN information, which may also give some
   explanation in the reason field to tell the user that the associated
   domain name is a produced name according to some bundle domain name
   policy.

   Example <check> Response        for     an authorized client:

   S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   S:      <response>
   S:        <result code="1000">
   S:              <msg>Command completed successfully</msg>
   S:        </result>
   S:        <resData>
   S:              <domain:chkData
   S:               xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
   S:        <domain:cd>
   S:                  <domain:name avail="1">
                  xn--fsq270a.example</domain:name>
   S:        </domain:cd>
   S:        <domain:cd>
   S:                  <domain:name avail="1">
                  xn--fsqz41a.example</domain:name>
   S:                  <domain:reason>This associated domain name is
               a produced name
                   based on bundle name policy.</domain:reason>
   S:        </domain:cd>
   S:               </domain:chkData>
   S:        </resData>
   S:        <trID>
   S:              <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   S:              <svTRID>54322-XYZ</svTRID>
   S:        </trID>
   S:      </response>
   S:</epp>

7.1.2.  EPP <info> Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <info> command
   described in the EPP domain mapping [RFC5731].  However, additional
   elements are defined for the <info> response.

   When an <info> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain child elements as described in the EPP
   domain mapping [RFC5731].  In addition, the EPP <extension> element
   SHOULD contain a child <b-dn:infData> element that identifies the
   extension namespace if the domain object has data associated with
   this extension and based on its service policy.  The <b-dn:infData>
   element contains the <b-dn:bundle> which has the following child
   elements:

   o  An <b-dn:rdn> element that contains the RDN, along with the
      attributes described below.

   o  An OPTIONAL <b-dn:bdn> element that contains the BDN, along with
      the attributes described below.

   The above elements contain the following attributes:

   o  An optional "uLabel" attribute represents the U-label of the
      element.

   Example <info> Response for     an authorized client:

   <info> Response for the unauthorized client has not been changed,see
   [RFC5731] for detail.

   An EPP error response MUST be returned if an <info> command cannot be
   processed for any reason.

7.1.3.  EPP <transfer> Query Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <transfer> command
   or <transfer> reponse described in the EPP domain mapping [RFC5731].

7.2.  EPP Transform Commands

   EPP provides five commands to transform domain objects: <create> to
   create an instance of a domain object, <delete> to delete an instance
   of a domain object, <renew> to extend the validity period of a domain
   object, <transfer> to manage domain object sponsorship changes, and
   <update> to change information associated with a domain object.

   When theses commands have been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain child elements as described in the EPP
   domain mapping [RFC5731].  This EPP <extension> element SHOULD
   contain the <b-dn:bundle> which has the following child elements:

   o  An <b-dn:rdn> element that contains the RDN, along with the
      attributes described below.

   o  An OPTIONAL <b-dn:bdn> element that contains the BDN, along with
      the attributes described below.

   The above elements contain the following attribute:

   o  An optional "uLabel" attribute represents the U-label of the
      element.

7.2.1.  EPP <create> Command

   This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP <create>
   command described in the EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731] for
   bundled names registration.

   In addition to the EPP command elements described in the EPP domain
   mapping [RFC5731], the <create> command SHALL contain an <extension>
   element.  The <extension> element SHOULD contain a child
   <b-dn:create> element that identifies the bundle namespace and the
   location of the bundle name schema.

   Example <create> command:

   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:      <command>

   C:        <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   C:      </command>
   C:</epp>

   When an <create> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <creData> element MUST contain child elements as described in the EPP
   domain mapping [RFC5731].  In addition, the EPP <extension> element
   SHOULD contain a child <b-dn:creData> element that identifies the
   extension namespace if the domain object has data associated with
   this extension and based on its service policy.  The <b-dn:creData>
   element contains the <b-dn:bundle> element.

8.  Formal Syntax

   An EPP object name mapping extension for bundled names is specified
   in XML Schema notation.  The formal syntax presented here is a
   complete schema representation of the object mapping suitable for
   automated validation of EPP XML instances.  The BEGIN and END tags
   are not part of the schema; they are used to note the beginning and
   ending of the schema for URI registration purposes.

9.  Internationalization Considerations

   EPP is represented in XML, which provides native support for encoding
   information using the Unicode character set and its more compact
   representations including UTF-8.  Conformant XML processors recognize
   both UTF-8 and UTF-16.  Though XML includes provisions to identify
   and use other character encodings through use of an "encoding"
   attribute in an <?xml?> declaration, use of UTF-8 is RECOMMENDED.

   As an extension of the EPP domain name mapping, the elements, element
   content described in this document MUST inherit the
   internationalization conventions used to represent higher-layer
   domain and core protocol structures present in an XML instance that
   includes this extension.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].  IANA is
   requested to assignment the following two URIs.

   Registration request for the IDN namespace:

   o  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:b-dn-1.0





Kong, et al.             Expires April 29, 2018                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft          EPP bundled names Mapping           October 2017


   o  Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
      document.

   o  XML: None.  Namespace URI does not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the IDN XML schema:

   o  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:b-dn-1.0

   o  Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
      document.

   o  XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of this document.

11.  Security Considerations

   The object mapping extension described in this document does not
   provide any other security services or introduce any additional
   considerations beyond those described by [RFC5730] or those caused by
   the protocol layers used by EPP.

12.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   o  The Chinese Domain Name Consortium(CDNC) including CNNIC, TWNIC,
      HKIRC, MONIC, SGNIC and more have followed the principles defined
      in this document for many years.

   o  CNNIC and TELEINFO have implemented this extension in their EPP
      based Chinese domain name registration system.

   o  Public Interest Registry, has requested to implement technical
      bundling of second level domains for .NGO and .ONG.  This means
      that by registering and purchasing a domain in the .ngo TLD, for
      example, the NGO registrant is also registering and purchasing the
      corresponding name in the .ong TLD (and vice-versa for
      registrations in .ong).

13.  Acknowledgements

   The authors especially thank the authors of [RFC5730] and [RFC5731]
   and the following ones of CNNIC: Weiping Yang, Chao Qi.  This draft
   extends the draft draft-kong-epp-idn-variants-mapping to support both
   forms of bundled names: V-label.TLD and LABEL.V-tld.

   Useful comments were made by John Klensin, Scott Hollenbeck, Patrick
   Mevzek and Edward Lewis.
