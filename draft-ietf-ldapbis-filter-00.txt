2.  Abstract

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC2251] defines a
   network representation of a search filter transmitted to an LDAP
   server.  Some applications may find it useful to have a common way of
   representing these search filters in a human-readable form.  This
   document defines a human-readable string format for representing the

INTERNET-DRAFT   String Representation of LDAP Filters  22 November 2000


   full range of possible LDAP version 3 search filters, including
   extended match filters.

   This document replaces RFC 2254.  See Appendix A for a list of
   changes relative to RFC 2254.

3.  LDAP Search Filter Definition

   An LDAPv3 search filter is defined in Sections 4.5.1 of [RFC2251] as
   follows:

        Filter ::= CHOICE {
                and                [0] SET OF Filter,
                or                 [1] SET OF Filter,
                not                [2] Filter,
                equalityMatch      [3] AttributeValueAssertion,
                substrings         [4] SubstringFilter,
                greaterOrEqual     [5] AttributeValueAssertion,
                lessOrEqual        [6] AttributeValueAssertion,
                present            [7] AttributeDescription,
                approxMatch        [8] AttributeValueAssertion,
                extensibleMatch    [9] MatchingRuleAssertion
        }

        SubstringFilter ::= SEQUENCE {
                type    AttributeDescription,
                -- at least one must be present
                substrings    SEQUENCE OF CHOICE {
                        initial        [0] LDAPString,
                        any            [1] LDAPString,
                        final          [2] LDAPString
                }
        }

        AttributeValueAssertion ::= SEQUENCE {
                attributeDesc   AttributeDescription,
                assertionValue  AssertionValue
        }

        MatchingRuleAssertion ::= SEQUENCE {
                matchingRule    [1] MatchingRuleID OPTIONAL,
                type            [2] AttributeDescription OPTIONAL,
                matchValue      [3] AssertionValue,
                dnAttributes    [4] BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
        }

        AttributeDescription ::= LDAPString




Smith & Howes      Intended Category: Standards Track           [Page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT   String Representation of LDAP Filters  22 November 2000


        AttributeValue ::= OCTET STRING

        MatchingRuleID ::= LDAPString

        AssertionValue ::= OCTET STRING

        LDAPString ::= OCTET STRING

   where the LDAPString above is limited to the UTF-8 encoding of the
   ISO 10646 character set [RFC2279].  The AttributeDescription is a
   string representation of the attribute description and is defined in
   [RFC2251].  The AttributeValue and AssertionValue OCTET STRING have
   the form defined in [RFC2252].  The Filter is encoded for
   transmission over a network using the Basic Encoding Rules defined in
   [ASN.1], with simplifications described in [RFC2251].

4.  String Search Filter Definition

   The string representation of an LDAP search filter is defined by the
   following grammar, following the ABNF notation defined in [RFC2234].
   The filter format uses a prefix notation.

        filter         = "(" filtercomp ")"
        filtercomp     = and / or / not / item
        and            = "&" filterlist
        or             = "|" filterlist
        not            = "!" filter
        filterlist     = 1*filter
        item           = simple / present / substring / extensible
        simple         = attr filtertype assertionvalue
        filtertype     = equal / approx / greater / less
        equal          = "="
        approx         = "~="
        greater        = ">="
        less           = "<="
        extensible     = attr [":dn"] [":" matchingrule] ":=" assertionvalue
                         / [":dn"] ":" matchingrule ":=" assertionvalue
        present        = attr "=*"
        substring      = attr "=" [initial] any [final]
        initial        = value
        any            = "*" *(value "*")
        final          = value
        attr           = <AttributeDescription from Section 4.1.5 of [RFC2251]>
        matchingrule   = <MatchingRuleId from Section 4.1.9 of [RFC2251]>
        value          = <AttributeValue from Section 4.1.6 of [RFC2251]
                          encoded using the valueencoding rule>
        assertionvalue = <AssertionValue from Section 4.1.7 of [RFC2251]
                          encoded using the valueencoding rule>

        valueencoding  = 0*(normal / escaped)
        normal         = %x01-27 / %x2b-5b / %x5d-7f
        escaped        = " 0" / "2" ( "8" / "9" / "a" ) / "5c"


   The attr and matchingrule constructs are as described in the
   corresponding section of [RFC2251] given above.

INTERNET-DRAFT   String Representation of LDAP Filters  22 November 2000


   The valueencoding rule provides that the characters "*" (ASCII 0x2a),
   "(" (ASCII 0x28), ")" (ASCII 0x29), " 0x00) are represented as the
   backslash " followed by the two hexadecimal digits representing the
   ASCII value of the encoded character.

   This simple escaping mechanism eliminates filter-parsing ambiguities
   and allows any filter that can be represented in LDAP to be
   represented as a NUL-terminated string. Other characters besides the
   ones listed above may be escaped using this mechanism, for example,
   non-printing characters.

   For example, the filter checking whether the "cn" attribute contained
   a value with the character "*" anywhere in it would be represented as
   "(cn=*\2a*)".

   Note that although both the substring and present productions in the
   grammar above can produce the "attr=*" construct, this construct is
   used only to denote a presence filter.

5.  Examples

   This section gives a few examples of search filters written using
   this notation.

        (cn=Babs Jensen)
        (!(cn=Tim Howes))
        (&(objectClass=Person)(|(sn=Jensen)(cn=Babs J*)))
        (o=univ*of*mich*)
        (seeAlso=)

   The following examples illustrate the use of extensible matching.

        (cn:1.2.3.4.5:=Fred Flintstone)
        (cn:=Betty Rubble)
        (sn:dn:2.4.6.8.10:=Barney Rubble)
        (o:dn:=Ace Industry)
        (:1.2.3:=Wilma Flintstone)
        (:dn:2.4.6.8.10:=Dino)

   The first example shows use of the matching rule "1.2.3.4.5".

   The second example demonstrates use of a MatchingRuleAssertion form
   without a matchingRule.

   The third example illustrates the use of the ":dn" notation to
   indicate that matching rule "2.4.6.8.10" should be used when making
   comparisons, and that the attributes of an entry's distinguished name
   should be considered part of the entry when evaluating the match.



Smith & Howes      Intended Category: Standards Track           [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT   String Representation of LDAP Filters  22 November 2000


   The fourth example denotes an equality match, except that DN
   components should be considered part of the entry when doing the
   match.

   The fifth example is a filter that should be applied to any attribute
   supporting the matching rule given (since the attr has been omitted).

   The sixth and final example is also a filter that should be applied
   to any attribute supporting the matching rule given.  Attributes
   supporting the matching rule contained in the DN should also be
   considered.

   The following examples illustrate the use of the escaping mechanism.

        (o=Parens R Us \28for all your parenthetical needs\29)
        (cn=*\2A*)
        (filename=C:\5cMyFile)
        (bin=\00\00\00\04)
        (sn=Lu\c4\8di\c4\87)
        (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.0;binary=\04\02\48\69)

   The first example shows the use of the escaping mechanism to
   represent parenthesis characters. The second shows how to represent a
   "*" in a value, preventing it from being interpreted as a substring
   indicator. The third illustrates the escaping of the backslash
   character.

   The fourth example shows a filter searching for the four-byte value
   0x00000004, illustrating the use of the escaping mechanism to
   represent arbitrary data, including NUL characters.

   The fifth example illustrates the use of the escaping mechanism to
   represent various non-ASCII UTF-8 characters.

   The sixth and final example demonstrates assertion of a BER encoded
   value.

6.  Security Considerations

   This memo describes a string representation of LDAP search filters.
   While the representation itself has no known security implications,
   LDAP search filters do. They are interpreted by LDAP servers to
   select entries from which data is retrieved.  LDAP servers should
   take care to protect the data they maintain from unauthorized access.

   Please refer to the Security Considerations sections of RFC 2251
   [RFC2251], RFC 2829 [RFC2829], and RFC 2830 [RFC2830] for more
   information.

13.  Appendix C: Loose Ends


   There has been some discussion on the LDAPBIS working group
   discussion list about how to modify the LDAPv3 protocol specification
   to support use of substring filters within an extensible match
   filter, which led to further discussion about whether the definition
   of the SubstringFilter should be changed from LDAPString to
   AssertionValue.  Once that issue is resolved, this filter
   specification will likely need to be revised to accommodate the
   group's decision.
