1. Introduction

   BGP Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the
   dissemination of traffic flow specification rules.  It leverages the
   BGP Control Plane to simplify the distribution of ACLs, new filter
   rules can be injected to all BGP peers simultaneously without
   changing router configuration. The typical application of BGP Flow-
   spec is to automate the distribution of traffic filter lists to
   routers for DDOS mitigation.

   RFC5575 defines a new BGP Network Layer Reachability Information
   (NLRI) format used to distribute traffic flow specification rules.
   NLRI (AFI=1, SAFI=133)is for IPv4 unicast filtering. NLRI (AFI=1,
   SAFI=134)is for BGP/MPLS VPN filtering. [IPv6-FlowSpec] and [Layer2-
   FlowSpec] extend the flow-spec rules for IPv6 and layer 2 Ethernet
   packets respectively. All these flow specifications match parts only
   reflect single layer IP/Ethernet information like source/destination
   MAC, source/destination IP prefix, protocol type, ports, and etc.

   In cloud computing era, multi-tenancy has become a core requirement
   for data centers. Since NVO3 can satisfy multi-tenancy key
   requirements, this technology is being deployed in an increasing
   number of cloud data center network. NVO3 is an overlay technology,
   VXLAN and NVGRE are two typical NVO3 encapsulations. GENEVE [draft-
   ietf-nvo3-geneve-00],GUE[draft-ietf-nvo3-gue-01] and GPE [draft-
   ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe-00] are three emerging NVO3 encapsulations in
   progress.

            Figure 1 NVO3 data center interconnection

   The MPLS L2/L3 VPN in the WAN network can be used for NVO3 based
   data center network interconnection. When the DC and the WAN are
   operated by the same administrative entity, the Service Provider can
   decide to integrate the GW and WAN Edge PE functions in the same
   router for obvious CAPEX and OPEX saving reasons. This is
   illustrated in Figure 1. There are two interconnection solutions as
   follows:

      1. End to end NVO3 tunnel across different data centers. NVE1
   perform NVO3 encapsulation for DCI interconnection with NVE3, the
   destination VTEP IP is NVE3's IP. The GW doesn't perform NVO3 tunnel
   termination. The DCI WAN is pure underlay network.

      2. Segmented NVO3 tunnels across different data centers. NVE1
   doesn't perform end to end NVO3 encapsulation to NVE3 for DCI
   interconnection. The GW performs NVO3 tunnel encapsulation
   termination, and then transmits the inner original traffic through
   MPLS network to peer data center GW. The peer data center GW

Internet-Draft             NVO3 Flow Spec                December 2015


   terminates MPLS encapsulation, and then performs NVO3 encapsulation
   to transmit the traffic to local NVE3.

   In the first solution, to differentiate bandwidth and QOS among
   different tenants or applications, different TE tunnels in the WAN
   network will be used to carry the end to end NVO3 encapsulation
   traffic using VN ID, NVO3 outer header DSCP and etc as traffic
   classification match part. BGP Flow-spec protocol can be used to set
   the traffic classification on all GWs simultaneously.

   In the second solution, a centralized BGP speaker can be deployed
   for DDOS mitigation in the WAN network. When the analyzer detects
   abnormal traffic, it will automatically generate Flow-spec rules and
   distribute it to each GW through BGP Flow-spec protocol, the match
   part should include inner or outer L2/L3 layer or NVO3 header.

   In summary, the Flow specification match part on the GW/PE should
   include inner layer 2 Ethernet header, inner layer 3 IP header,
   outer layer 2 Ethernet header, outer layer 3 IP header, and/or NVO3
   header information. Because the current match part lacks layer
   indicator and NVO3 header information, so it can't be used directly
   for the traffic filtering based on NVO3 header or a specified layer
   header directly. This draft will propose a new subset of component
   types to support the NVO3 flow-spec application.

2. The Flow Specification encoding for NVO3

   In default, the current flow-spec rules can only impose on the outer
   layer header of NVO3 encapsulation data packets. To make traffic
   filtering based on NVO3 header and inner header of NVO3 packets, a
   new component type acts as a delimiter is introduced. The delimiter
   type is used to specify the boundary of the inner or outer layer
   component types for NVO3 data packets. All the component types
   defined in [RFC5575],[IPv6-FlowSpec],[Layer2-FlowSpec],and etc can
   be used between two delimiters.

   The NVO3 outer layer address normally belongs to public network, the
   "Flow Specification" NLRI only for the outer layer header doesn't
   need to include Route Distinguisher field (8 bytes). If the outer
   layer address belongs to a VPN, the NLRI format for the outer header
   should consist of a fixed-length Route Distinguisher field (8 bytes)
   corresponding to the VPN, the RD is followed by the detail flow
   specifications for the outer layer.

   VN ID is the identification for each tenant network, the "Flow
   Specification" NLRI for NVO3 header part should always include VN ID
   field, Route Distinguisher field doesn't need to be included.

Internet-Draft             NVO3 Flow Spec                December 2015


   The inner layer MAC/IP address always associates with a VN ID, the
   NLRI format for the inner header should consist of a fixed-length
   VNID field (4 bytes), the VNID is followed by the detail flow
   specifications for the inner layer. The NLRI length field shall
   include both the 4 bytes of the VN ID as well as the subsequent flow
   specification. In NVO3 terminating into VPN scenario, if multiple
   access VN ID maps to one VPN instance, one share VN ID can be
   carried in the Flow-Spec rule to enforce the rule to entire VPN
   instance, the share VN ID and VPN correspondence should be
   configured on each VPN PE beforehand, the function of the layer3 VN
   ID is same with Route Distinguisher to act as the identification of
   VPN instance.

   This document proposes the following extended specifications for
   NVO3 flow:



   Type TBD1 -                 - Delimiter type

   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), Value>.

   When the delimiter type is present, it indicates the component types
   for the inner or outer layer of NVO3 packets will be followed
   immediately. At the same time, it indicates the end of the component
   types belonging to the former delimiter.



   The value field defines encapsulation type and is encoded as:

      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |          Encap Type           |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    | I | O |        Resv           |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   This document defines the following Encap types:

        - VXLAN: Tunnel Type = 0

        - NVGRE: Tunnel Type = 1

   I: If I is set to one, it indicates the component types for the
   inner layer of NVO3 packets will be followed immediately.

Internet-Draft             NVO3 Flow Spec                December 2015


   O: If O is set to one, it indicates the component types for the
   outer layer of NVO3 packets will be followed immediately.

   For NVO3 header part, the following additional component types are
   introduced.

   Type TBD2 - VNID

      Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>.

   Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match 24-bit VN
   ID which is used as tenant identification in NVO3 network. For NVGRE
   encapsulation, the VNID is equivalent to VSID. Values are encoded as
   1- to 3-byte quantities.

   Type TBD3 - Flow ID

      Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

   Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match 8-bit Flow
   id fields which are only useful for NVGRE encapsulation. Values are
   encoded as 1-byte quantity.



3. The Flow Specification Traffic Actions for NVO3

   The current traffic filtering actions can still be used for NVO3
   encapsulation traffic. For Traffic Marking, only the DSCP in outer
   header can be modified.

4. Security Considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the BGP protocol by this
   specification.

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create and maintain a new registry entitled:

   "Flow spec NVO3 Component Types":

   Type TBD1 - Delimiter type

   Type TBD2 - VNID

   Type TBD3 - Flow ID
