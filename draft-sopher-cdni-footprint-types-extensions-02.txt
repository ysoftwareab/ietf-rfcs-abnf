                    CDNI Request Routing Extensions
            draft-sopher-cdni-footprint-types-extensions-02

Abstract

   Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Networks
   Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery
   Network (CDN) is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer
   serves as the downstream CDN (dCDN).  This document supplements to
   the CDNI Metadata Footprint Types defined in RFC 8006.  The Footprint
   Types defined in this document can be used for Footprint objects as
   part of the Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI)
   defined in RFC 8008.  The defined Footprint Types are derived from
   requirements raised by Open Caching but are also applicable to CDNI
   use cases in general.

1.  Introduction

   The Streaming Video Alliance [SVA] is a global association that works
   to solve streaming video challenges in an effort to improve end-user
   experience and adoption.  The Open Caching Working Group [OCWG] of
   the Streaming Video Alliance [SVA] is focused on the delegation of
   video delivery requests from commerical CDNs to a caching layer at
   the ISP's network.  Open Caching architecture is a specific use case
   of CDNI where the commercial CDN is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the
   ISP caching layer is the downstream CDN (dCDN).  The Open Caching
   Request Routing Specification [OC-RR] defines the Request Routing
   process and the interfaces that are required for its provisioning.
   This document defines and registers CDNI Footprint and Capabilities
   objects[RFC8008] that are required for Open Caching Request Routing.

   For consistency with other CDNI documents this document follows the
   CDNI convention of uCDN (upstream CDN) and dCDN (downstream CDN) to
   represent the commercial CDN and ISP caching layer respectively.

Internet-Draft       CDNI Footprint Types Extensions           June 2021


   This document registers two CDNI Metadata Footprint Types (section
   7.2 of [RFC8006]) for the defined objects:

   o  IPv4v6CIDR Footprint Type (for dCDN advertising a footprint that
      consists of both IPv4 and IPv6 client addresses)

   o  ISO3166Code Footprint Type (e.g. for dCDN advertising a footprint
      that is specific to a State in the USA)

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

   o  CDN - Content Delivery Network

   Additionally, this document reuses the terminology defined in
   [RFC6707], [RFC7336], [RFC8006], [RFC8007], [RFC8008], and [RFC8804].
   Specifically, we use the following CDNI acronyms:

   o  uCDN, dCDN - Upstream CDN and Downstream CDN respectively (see
      [RFC7336] )

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  CDNI Metadata Additonal Footprint Types

   Section 5 of [RFC8008] describes the FCI Capability Advertisement
   Object, which includes an array of CDNI Footprint Objects.  Each such
   object has a footprint-type and a footprint-value, as described in
   section 4.2.2.2 of [RFC8006].  This document defines additional
   footprint types, beyond those mentioned in CDNI metadata [RFC8006].
   For consistency, this document follows the CDNI notation of uCDN for
   (the commercial CDN) and dCDN (the ISP caching layer).

2.1.  CDNI Metadata IPv4v6CIDR Footprint Type

   As described in section 5 of [RFC8008], the FCI Capability
   Advertisement Object includes an array of CDNI Footprint Objects.
   Appendix B of [RFC8008] specifies the semantics of a Footprint
   Objects array as a multiple, additive, footprint constraints.
   Meaning, the advertisement of different footprint types narrows the
   dCDN's candidacy cumulatively.

Internet-Draft       CDNI Footprint Types Extensions           June 2021


   Sections 4.3.5 and 4.3.6 of [RFC8006] specify the "IPv4CIDR" and
   "IPv6CIDR" footprint types, respectively, for listing IP addresses
   blocks.  Using Footprint Objects of these types, one can define an
   FCI Capability Advertisement Object footprint constraints that match
   IPv4 or IPv6 clients.  However, the described "narrowing" semantic of
   the Footprint Objects array prevents the usage of these objects
   together in order to create a footprint constraint that matches IPv4
   clients together with IPv6 clients.

   Below is an example for an attempt at creating an object matching
   IPv4 clients of subnet "192.0.2.0/24", as well as IPv6 clients of
   subnet "2001:db8::/32".  Such a definition results with an empty list
   of clients, as the constraints are additives and a client address
   cannot be both IPv4 and IPv6.


   {
     "capabilities": [
       {
         "capability-type": <CDNI capability object type>,
         "capability-value": <CDNI capability object>,
         "footprints": [
             {
                 "footprint-type": "ipv4cidr",
                 "footprint-value": ["192.0.2.0/24"]
             },
             {
                 "footprint-type": "ipv6cidr",
                 "footprint-value": ["2001:db8::/32"]
             }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }


   To overcome the described limitation and allow a list of footprint
   constraints that matches both IPv4 and IPv6 client addresses, we
   introduce below the "IPv4v6CIDR" simple data type as well as a
   derived footprint type.

2.1.1.  CDNI Metadata IPv4v6CIDR Data Type

   The "IPv4v6CIDR" data type specified in Section 2.1.1.1, can be
   either IPv4 or IPv6 address blocks.  The data type is added to the
   list of data types described in section 4.3 of [RFC8006] that are
   used as properties of CDNI Metadata objects.

Internet-Draft       CDNI Footprint Types Extensions           June 2021


2.1.1.1.  CDNI Metadata IPv4v6CIDR Data Type Description

   Either an IPv4CIDR property or IPv6CIDR property, as described in
   sections 4.3.5 and 4.3.6 of [RFC8006] respectively.

      Type: String

      Example IPv4v6CIDRs:

      "192.0.2.0/24"

      "2001:db8::/32"

2.1.2.  CDNI Metadata IPv4v6CIDR Footprint Type Description

   The "IPv4v6CIDR" simple data type specified in Section 2.1.1, is
   added to the data types listed as footprint types in section 4.2.2.2
   of [RFC8006].

   Below is an adjustment for the example in Section 2.1.1, now
   embedding a footprint object of type "IPv4v6CIDR".


   {
     "capabilities": [
       {
         "capability-type": <CDNI capability object type>,
         "capability-value": <CDNI capability object>,
         "footprints": [
             {
                 "footprint-type": "ipv4v6cidr",
                 "footprint-value": ["192.0.2.0/24", "2001:db8::/32"]
             }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }


2.2.  CDNI Metadata ISO3166Code Footprint Type

   Section 4.3.8 of [RFC8006] specifies the "Country Code" footprint
   type for listing [ISO3166-1] alpha-2 codes.  Using Footprint Objects
   of this type, one can define an FCI Capability Advertisement Object
   footprint constraints that match a specific country.  Here we define
   the iso3166code simple data type, as well as a footprint type
   allowing the dCDN to define constraints matching geographic areas

   with better granularity, specifically using the [ISO3166-2] Country
   Subdivision codes.

2.2.1.  CDNI Metadata ISO3166Code Data Type

   The "ISO3166Code" data type specified in Section 2.2.1.1, can either
   describe a country based on an [ISO3166-1] alpha-2 code, or describe
   a more specific subdivision using an [ISO3166-2] code.  The data type
   is added to the list of data types described in section 4.3 of
   [RFC8006] that are used as properties of CDNI Metadata objects.

2.2.1.1.  CDNI Metadata ISO3166Code Data Type Description

   Either an [ISO3166-1] alpha-2 code in lowercase, or such a code
   followed by a dash as well as a more specific subdivision [ISO3166-2]
   alphanumeric code in lowercase.

      Type: String

      Example ISO3166Codes:

      "ca"

      "us-ny"

2.2.2.  CDNI Metadata ISO3166Code Footprint Type Description

   The "ISO3166Code" simple data type specified in Section 2.2.1 , is
   added to the data types listed as footprint types in section 4.2.2.2
   of [RFC8006] .

   Below is an adjustment for the example in Section 2.2.1 , now
   embedding a footprint object of type "ISO3166Code".  The Footprint
   Object in this example creates a constraints matching clients both in
   Canada (ISO [ISO3166-1] alpha-2 code "CA") as well as in the state of
   New-York (ISO [ISO3166-2] Subdivision code "NY") in the (ISO
   [ISO3166-1] alpha-2 code "US").

       }
     ]
   }


3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  CDNI Metadata Footprint Types

   As described in section 7.2 of [RFC8006] , the "CDNI Metadata
   Footprint Types" subregistry was created within the "Content Delivery
   Network Interconnection (CDNI) Parameters" registry.  The created
   namespace defines the valid values for Footprint Object Types, and is
   already populated with the types described in Section 4.2.2.2 of
   [RFC8006] .

   This document requests the registration of the two additional
   footprint type as defined in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 :

   +--------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
   |        Footprint   |  Description             | Specification     |
   | Type               |                          |                   |
   +--------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
   |        ipv4v6cidr  |  IPv4/IPv6 address block |         RFCthis   |
   |        iso3166code |  ISO 3166-1/2 Country or |         RFCthis   |
   |                    | Subdivision Code         |                   |
   +--------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+

   [RFC Editor: Please replace RFCthis with the published RFC number for
   this document.]

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification is in accordance with the CDNI Request Routing:
   Footprint and Capabilities Semantics.  As such, it is subject to the
   security and privacy considerations as defined in Section 8 of
   [RFC8006] and in Section 7 of [RFC8008] respectively.
