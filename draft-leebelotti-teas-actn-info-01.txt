1. Introduction

   This draft provides an information model for the requirements
   identified in the ACTN requirements [ACTN-Req] and the ACTN
   interfaces identified in the ACTN architecture and framework
   document [ACTN-Frame].

   The purpose of this draft is to put all information elements of ACTN
   in one place before proceeding to development work necessary for
   protocol extensions and data models.

   The ACTN reference architecture identified a three-tier control
   hierarchy as depicted in Figure 1:

   - Customer Network Controllers (CNC)
   - Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC)
   - Physical Network Controllers (PNC).

               Figure 1: A Three-tier ACTN control hierarchy



   The two interfaces with respect to the MDSC, one north of the MDSC
   and the other south of the MDSC are referred to as CMI (CNC-MDSC
   Interface) and MPI (MDSC-PNC Interface), respectively. It is
   intended to model these two interfaces and derivative interfaces
   thereof (e.g., MDSC to MSDC in a hierarchy of MDSCs) with one common
   model.

   Appendix A provides some relevant ACTN use-cases extracted from
   [ACTN-Req]. Appendix A is information only and may help readers
   understand the context of key use-cases addressed in [ACTN-Req].



2. ACTN Common Interfaces Information Model

   This section provides ACTN common interface information model to
   describe in terms of primitives, objects, their properties
   (represented as attributes), their relationships, and the resources
   for the service applications needed in the ACTN context.

   Basic primitives (messages) are required between the CNC-MDSC and
   MDSC-PNC controllers. These primitives can then be used to support
   different ACTN network control functions like network topology
   request/query, VN service request, path computation and connection
   control, VN service policy negotiation, enforcement, routing
   options, etc.

   The standard interface is described between a client controller and
   a server controller. A client-server relationship is recursive
   between a CNC and a MDSC and between a MDSC and a PNC. In the CMI,
   the client is a CNC while the server is a MDSC. In the MPI, the
   client is a MDSC and the server is a PNC. There may also be MDSC-
   MDSC interface(s) that need to be supported. This may arise in a
   hierarchy of MDSCs in which workloads may need to be partitioned to
   multiple MDSCs.

   At a minimum, the following VN action primitives should be
   supported:

   - VN Instantiate (See Section 2.1.1. for the description)

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                   March 2015


   - VN Modify (See Section 2.1.2. for the description)

   - VN Delete (See Section 2.1.3. for the description)

   - VN Query (See Section 2.1.4. for the description)

   - VN Path Compute (See Section 2.1.4. for the description)

   - VN Update ((See Section 2.1.5. for the description)

   The functionality below will be supported as part of already defined
   primitives as above.

   - Security negotiation
   - Local Domain path computation (related to PNC
   - Coordination of multi-destination (<Coordination
     Multidestination>)

2.1. VN Action Primitives

   This section provides a list of main primitives necessary to satisfy
   ACTN requirements specified in [ACTN-REQ].

   <VN Action> describes main primitives. VN Action can be one of the
   following primitives: (i) instantiate; (ii) modify; (iii) delete;
   (iv) path compute; (v) query; (vi) update.



   <VN Action> ::= <VN Instantiate> |

                   <VN Modify> |

                   <VN Delete> |

                   <VN Path Compute> |

                   <VN Query> |

                   <VN Update>

2.1.1. VN Instantiate

   <VN Instantiate> refers to an action from customers/applications to
   request their VNs. This primitive can also be applied from an MDSC
   to a PNC requesting a VN (if the domain the PNC supports can
   instantiate the entire VN) or a part of VN elements.

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                   March 2015


2.1.2. VN Modify

   <VN Modify> refers to an action from customers/applications to
   modify an existing VN (i.e., instantiated VN). This primitive can
   also be applied from an MDSC to a PNC requesting a VN (if the domain
   the PNC supports can instantiate the entire VN) or a part of VN
   elements.



2.1.3. VN Delete

   <VN Delete> refers to an action from customers/applications to
   delete an existing VN. This primitive can also be applied from an
   MDSC to a PNC requesting a VN (if the domain the PNC supports can
   instantiate the entire VN) or a part of VN elements.



2.1.4. VN Path Compute

   <VN Path Compute> refers to an action from customers/applications to
   request a VN path computation. This primitive can also be applied
   from an MDSC to a PNC requesting a VN (if the domain the PNC
   supports can instantiate the entire VN) or a part of VN elements.

   This is to be differentiated from a VN Instantiate. The purpose of
   VN Path Compute is a priori exploration to estimate network
   resources availability before making a VN instantiate decision.
   Obviously an abstracted view of network resources topology is needed
   to permit this function. This action is also necessary for an MDSC
   to PNCs in determining end-to-end multi-domain paths. VN Instantiate
   may also trigger an MDSC for a VN Path Compute to lower-level PNCs
   in order to determine end-to-end paths that comprise of a VN.

2.1.5. VN Query

   <VN Query> refers to any query pertaining to the VN that has been
   already instantiated. VN Query fulfills a pull model and permit to
   get topology view.

2.1.6. VN Update

   <VN Update> refers to any update to the VN that need to be updated
   to the subscribers. VN Update fulfills a push model.

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                   March 2015


   There are other existing and upcoming TE mechanisms to fulfill the
   same function as VN Update. VN Update can be built on these other
   existing TE mechanisms. The details are TDB.

[Editor's Note: The mapping of VN Primitives and their VN Objects will
be provided in the future revision.]



2.2. VN Objects

   This section provides a list of objects associated with VN action
   primitives.

2.2.1. VN Identifier

   <VN Identifier> is an identifier that identifies a unique VN.



2.2.2. VN Topology Metric

   <VN Topology Metric> describes the requirements/preferences of VNs
   that customers/applications want to instantiate.

   <VN Topology Metric> ::= <VN Topology Type>

                            <VN Topology Attributes>

                            [<VN Topology Preference>]

                            [<VN Topology Objective Function>]

   Where

         <VN Topology Type> ::= <Path Vector> | <Graph>

         <VN Topology Attributes describes characteristics associated
         with any VN Topology link/path. These attributes could be
         reservable bandwidth, maximum link/path capacity, latency,
         SRLG, etc.

         <VN Topology Preference> describes if the request is

           .  a single vs. a bulk request,

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                   March 2015


           .  Multiple VN diversity in case of a bulk request, whether
               VNs should be disjoint or not),
           .  Single VN diversity (node/link disjoint)
           .  Others TBD.


         <VN Topology Objective Function> indicates a higher level of
         objective function applied to the VN level, for computing a
         path vector.VN is comprised of a set of paths and each one of
         these needs an objective function.



2.2.3. Traffic Matrix

   <Traffic Matrix> describes connectivity-level attributes that need
   to be conveyed by the CNC to MDSC or the MDSC to PNCs.

   <Traffic Matrix> ::= <End-Point List>

                        <Connectivity Type>

                        <Connectivity Metric>

   Where



      <End-Point List> ::= (<Interface Identifier>

                        [<Client Interface Capability>]

                        [<Source Indicator>])...

      It is assumed that a list of interface identifiers has been known
      to the server prior to any VN actions. The Client Capability
      comprises the client interface capability (e.g., maximum
      interface bandwidth, etc.).

      <Source Indicator> indicates if an End-point is source or not.



      <Connectivity Type> ::= <P2P> | <P2MP> | <MP2MP> | <MP2P>

      <Connectivity Metric> ::= <Bandwidth>

                                [<Latency>]

                                [<Latency-Variation>]

                                [<Packet-Loss>]



2.2.4. VN Survivability

   <VN Survivability> describes all attributes related with the VN
   protection level and its survivability policy enforced by the
   customers/applications.

   <VN Survivability> ::= <VN Protection Level>

                          <VN Survivability Policy>



   Where

      <VN Protection Level> ::= <No Protection> | <1+1> | <1:N>

      <VN Survivability Policy> ::= <Local Reroute Allowed>

                                    [<Domain Preference>]

                                    <Push Allowed>

                                    <Incremental Update>

      Where

          <Local Reroute Allowed> is a delegation policy to the Server
          to allow or not a local reroute fix upon a failure of the
          primary LSP.

          <Domain Preference> is only applied on the MPI where the MDSC
          (client) provides a domain preference to each PNC (server).

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                   March 2015


          <Push Allowed> is a policy that allows a server to trigger an
          updated VN topology upon failure without an explicit request
          from the client. Push action can be set as default unless
          otherwise specified.

          <Incremental Update> is another policy that triggers an
          incremental update from the server since the last period of
          update. Incremental update can be set as default unless
          otherwise specified.



2.2.5. VN Action Status

   <VN Action Status> is the status indicator whether the VN has been
   successfully instantiated, modified, or deleted in the server
   network or not in response to a particular VN action.



2.2.6. VN Topology

   <VN Topology> describes VN topology. Details of <VN Topology> are
   TBD.

   VN Topology can be defined using existing TE mechanisms. Details are
   TBD.

2.2.7. VN Connectivity Topology

   <VN Connectivity Topology> describes the instantiated VN property.
   Details are TBD.

   [Editor's Note: This may be combined with <VN Topology>.]



2.2.8. VN Service Preference

   <VN Service Preference> ::= <Location Service Preference >

                           <Client-specific Preference >

                           <End-Point Dynamic Selection Preference >

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                   March 2015


   Where

      <Location Service  Preference> describes the End-Point Location's
      support for certain Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) (e.g.,
      security function, firewall capability, etc.).


      <Client-specific Preference> describes any preference related to
      Virtual Network Service (VNS) that application/client can enforce
      via CNC towards lower level controllers. For example, permission
      the correct selection from the network of the destination related
      to the indicated VNF It is e.g. the case of VM migration among
      data center and CNC can enforce specific policy that can permit
      MDSC/PNC to calculate the correct path for the connectivity
      supporting the data center interconnection required by
      application.

      <End-Point Dynamic Selection Preference> describes if the End-
      Point can support load balancing, disaster recovery or VM
      migration and so can be part of the selection by MDSC following
      service Preference enforcement by CNC.

   Figure A.1 shows how VN service policies from the CNC are
   incorporated by the MDSC to support multi-destination applications.
   Multi-destination applications refer to applications in which the
   selection of the destination of a network path for a given source
   needs to be decided dynamically to support such applications.

   Data Center selection problems arise for VM mobility, disaster
   recovery and load balancing cases. VN's service policy plays an
   important role for virtual network operation. Service policy can be
   static or dynamic. Dynamic service policy for data center selection
   may be placed as a result of utilization of data center resources
   supporting VNs. The MDSC would then incorporate this information to
   meet the service objective of this application.

   This scenario is similar to the previous case in that the VN service
   policy for the application can be met by a set of multiple
   destinations that provide the required virtual network functions
   (VNF). Virtual network functions can be, for example, security
   functions required by the VN application. The VN service policy by
   the CNC would indicate the locations of a certain VNF that can be
   fulfilled. This policy information is critical in finding the
   optimal network path subject to this constraint. As VNFs can be
   dynamically moved across different DCs, this policy should be
   dynamically enforced from the CNC to the MDSC and the PNCs.

   Network Function Virtualization Services are usually setup between
   customers' premises and service provider premises and are provided
   mostly by cloud providers or content delivery providers. The context
   may include, but not limited to a security function like firewall, a
   traffic optimizer, the provisioning of storage or computation
   capacity where the customer does not care whether the service is
   implemented in a given data center or another. The customer has to
   provide (and CNC is providing this)the type of VNF he needs and the
   policy associated with it (e.g. metric like estimated delay to reach
   where VNF is located in the DC). The policy linked to VNF is
   requested as part of the VN instantiation. These services may be
   hosted virtually by the provider or physically part of the network.
   This allows the service provider to hide his own resources (both
   network and data centers) and divert customer requests where most
   suitable. This is also known as "end points mobility" case and
   introduces new concepts of traffic and service provisioning and
   resiliency (e.g., Virtual Machine mobility).

   Figure A.4 shows the flow of dynamic service control policy
   enforcement for performance and fault management initiated by
   customer per VN. The feedback loop and filtering mechanism tailored

   traditional network management paradigm. VN level dynamic OAM data
   model is a building block to support this capability.

     Figure A.5: E2E VN Survivability and Multi-layer Coordination for
                        Protection and Restoration

   Figure A.5 shows the need for E2E protection/restoration control
   coordination that involves CNC, MDSC and PNCs to meet the VN
   survivability requirement. VN survivability requirement and its
   policy need to be translated into multi-domain and multi-layer
   network protection and restoration scenarios across different
   controller types. After an E2E path is setup successfully, the MDSC
   has a unique role to enforce policy-based flexible VN survivability
   requirement by coordinating all PNC domains.

   As seen in Figure A.5, multi-layer (i.e., packet/optical)
   coordination is a subset of this E2E protection/restoration control
   operation. The MDSC has a role to play in determining an optimal
   protection/restoration level based on the customer's VN
   survivability requirement. For instance, the MDSC needs to interface
   the PNC for packet core as well as the PNC for optical core and
   enforce protection/restoration policy as part of the E2E
   protection/restoration. Neither the PNC for packet core nor the PNC
   for optical core is in a position to be aware of the E2E path and
   its protection/restoration situation. This role of the MDSC is
   unique for this reason. In some cases, the MDSC will have to
   determine and enforce optical bypass to find a feasible reroute path
   upon packet core network failure which cannot be resolved the packet
   core network itself.

   To coordinate this operation, the PNCs will need to update its
   domain level abstract topology upon resource changes due to a
   network failure or other factors. The MDSC will incorporate all
   these update to determine if an alternative E2E reroute path is
   necessary or not based on the changes reported from the PNCs. It
   will need to update the E2E abstract topology and the affected CN's
   VN topology in real-time. This refers to dynamic synchronization of
   topology from Physical topology to abstract topology to VN topology.

   MDSC will also need to perform the path restoration signaling to the
   affected PNCs whenever necessary.
