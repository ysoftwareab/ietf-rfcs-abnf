                                Abstract 
 
This document defines a framework and basis for the IANA registration of 
parameters defined in the ITU V.150 recommendation, which addresses the 
transmission of modem signals over IP. This includes both modem passthrough and 
modem relay operation. As a framework document, this internet draft leaves the 
details of the modem-over-IP (MoIP) protocols and formats  to the ITU V.150 
recommendation. Since the V.150 recommendation is work in progress by ITU 
SG16/Q11, registration of these parameters is contingent upon its impending 
ratification. Although these parameters are meant for use in text-based control 
protocols such as SDP, equivalent reformulations are planned for non-text 
protocols such as ITU H.245.

1.   Introduction 
 
The ITU V.150 recommendation is meant to standardize, in a comprehensive 
manner, the encapsulation of modem signals within IP. This includes both modem 
passthrough and modem relay operation.   
 
Although this internet draft is a first-cut application for the IANA 
registration of ITU V.150 parameters, the underlying ITU V.150 protocols and 
media formats it refers to  reflect the current consensus of the TIA TR.30.1 
(ITU SG16/Q11) study groups. These protocols and media formats have been 
crafted over a period of about two years and several meetings of modem experts, 
and are close to finalization.  
 
The following classes of parameters defined in ITU V.150 recommendation warrant 
IANA registration: 
 
  1. A new transport protocol, UDPSPRT (Simple Packet Relay Transport over 
     UDP).  
 
  2. New SDP attributes that qualify media streams associated with modem-over-
     IP. These may be modem passthrough or modem relay media streams.  
 
  3. New MIME types:   audio/v150mr and audio/v150fw. These indicate media  
     formats defined, in the ITU V.150 recommendation, for use in the modem-
     over-IP context. 
 
This document is initially submitted to the IETF's AVT working group because of 
the presence of new MIME definitions. Review by the IETF's MMUSIC working group 
is also solicited. 
 
2.   Registration of the  UDPSPRT transport protocol 
 
UDSPRT, Simple Packet Relay Transport over UDP,  is a reliable protocol that 
can be used to efficiently guarantee packet delivery in an IP network that is 
prone to packet loss.  
Kumar et al              August 2002                               Page 2 

              IANA Registration of ITU V.150 Parameters and MIMEs 
                                         
                                         
                                         
 
In a manner similar to the UDPTL protocol [3], UDPSRPT should be registered as 
a value of the SDP parameter "proto", referring to the transport protocol.  
 
Details of the UDPSPRT protocol are found in [1].  
 
3.   Registration of new SDP attributes 
 
The ITU V.150 recommendation defines several new SDP attributes. These should 
be registered as values of the SDP parameter "att-field" parameter. These are: 
   
  1. sprtparm, which lists parameters associated with the UDPSRPT protocol. 
  2. sprtmap, which dynamically defines a numerical identifier for modem relay 
     packets. 
  3. vndpar, used to pass vendor-specific parameters. 
  4. gfmtp, based on its definition [2]. This is used to dynamically associate, 
     with a format,  parameters that are not embedded in the MIME definition of 
     that format. 
 
In addition to being listed as an SDP attribute, 'gfmtp' warrants a new IANA 
registry of its own since new non-MIME parameters may be deemed useful and 
defined in the future. 
 
 Details of these attributes are found in [1]. 
 
4.   Registration of new MIME types 
 
4.1  Registration of the audio/v150mr MIME type 
 
This MIME represents the modem relay packet format as defined in the ITU V.150 
recommendation. Hence the suffix 'mr' (modem relay).   
 
     MIME media type name: audio 
      
     MIME subtype name: v150mr 
      
     Required parameters: 
          mr: the type of modem relay, from the set "v8" (ITU V.8-compatible)  
          and "u" (universal). 
          mg: the type of media gateway, from the set "0" (No 
          Transcompression), "1" (Single Transcompression) and "2" (Double 
          Transcompression. 
           
     Optional parameters: 
          versn: Version of the ITU V.150 recommendation used. Dotted  
          representation, x.y, where the integer 'x' is the main version  
          number ('1' for V.150.1) and the integer 'y' is the sub-version

              IANA Registration of ITU V.150 Parameters and MIMEs 
                                         
                                         
                                         
          number.  
          jmdelay: indicates whether the JM delay procedures for end-to-end  
          XID exchange are enabled or not. Permissible values are "yes" and 
          "no". 
          mrmods: This parameter lists supported modulation types.  These are 
          listed as one or mote comma-separated elements. Each element can 
          either be a single integer or two integers separated by a hyphen. No 
          white space is allowed. The integers, which  designate modulation 
          types are from the set "1" (V.34 duplex), "2" (V.34 Half-duplex), "3" 
          (V.32bis/V.32), "4" (V.22bis/V.22), "5" (V.17), "6" (V.29 half-
          duplex), "7" (V.27 ter), "8" (V.26 ter), "9" (V.26bis), "10" (V.23 
          duplex), "11" (V.23 half duplex), "12" (V.21), "13" (V.90 analog), 
          "14" (V.90 digital), "15" (V.91), "16" (V.92 analog) and "17" (V.92 
          digital). 
          txalgs: This parameter lists supported transcompression algorithms.  
          These are listed as one or mote comma-separated elements. Each 
          element can either be a single integer or two integers separated by a 
          hyphen. No white space is allowed. The integers, which  designate 
          transcompression algorithms are from the set "1" (V.44), "2" 
          (V.42bis) and "3" (MNP5). The default is "2". 
          v42maxdict: Maximum V.42 dictionary size. Value range and default 
          TBD. 
          v42maxstring: Maximum V.42 string size. Value range and default TBD. 
          v44maxtdict: Maximum V.44 transmit dictionary size. Value range and 
          default TBD. 
          v44maxtstring: Maximum V.44 transmit string size. Value range and 
          default TBD. 
          v44maxrdict: Maximum V.44 receive dictionary size. Value range and 
          default TBD. 
          v44maxrstring: Maximum V.44 receive string size. Value range and 
          default TBD. 
          v44maxthist: Maximum V.44 transmit history size. Value range and 
          default TBD. 
          v44maxrhist: Maximum V.44 receive history size. Value range and 
          default TBD. 
           
     Encoding considerations:  
          The  MIME audio/v150mr uses the UDPSPRT (Simple Packet Relay 
          Transport over UDP) reliable transport protocol as defined in the ITU 
          V.150 recommendation. As such, it consists of packets of binary data. 
           
     Security considerations:   
          The privacy and integrity of the data transmitted via V.150 modem 
          relay must be ensured at the  application level by means such as 
          encryption. The V.150 modem relay protocol does not hinder such end-
          to-end data protection. Nor does it provide any additional, inbuilt 
          safeguards that can be used in the absence of end-to-end, 
          application-level data security. The transcompression and other 
          algorithms  used in V.150 modem relay are published in various 
          standards and can be implemented by a resourceful attacker. 
 
Kumar et al              August 2002                               Page 4 

              IANA Registration of ITU V.150 Parameters and MIMEs 
                                         
                                         
                                         
          Likewise, V.150 modem relay procedures do not address session 
          authentication, which must be handled end-to-end by client and server  
          authentication applications. Authentication is out of the scope of a 
          bearer-level protocol such as V.150 modem relay. 
           
          Resource usage by a modem relay session may be monitored to prevent 
          denial of service attacks. The resource utilization of modem relay 
          sessions does not exhibit such non-uniformity so as to preclude such 
          resource limiting. 
            
          The MIME type contains no executable content that affects sessions or 
          session legs other than the ones in which the requester is a 
          participant. For these session legs, executable content in the form 
          of modem relay control messages is well within the normal 
          prerogatives of the requester.  
           
          Like other  encodings with open-ended content, the ITU V.150  
          modem relay format may be abused by hiding data using steganography.  
          However, due to its more limited context, it is unlikely that it  
          will be preferred for such misuse vis-a-vis other audio and video  
          encodings. 
 
     Interoperability considerations: Interoperability is limited to endpoints  
          or gateways that implement the mandatory parts of the ITU V.150 
          recommendation, "Procedures for the end-to-end connection of V-series 
          DCEs over an IP Network". Backward compatibility will be maintained 
          between all versions of this recommendation. 
            
     Published specification: The ITU V.150.1 specification, to be published. 
            
     Applications which use this media:   
          Endpoints and media gateways that interface with V-series modems on 
          one end, and with an IP network on the other end. In this case, the 
          on-ramp gateway does not support full modem termination which would 
          have allowed forwarding via a higher-layer protocol.

4.2  Registration of the audio/v150fw MIME type   
 
This MIME represents the format of  messages used to define the overall 
framework of modem-over-IP operation as defined in the ITU V.150 
recommendation. Hence the suffix 'fw' (framework). 
  
 
     MIME media type name: audio 
      
     MIME subtype name: v150fw 
      
     Required parameters: None.  
      
     Optional parameters: 
          messages: The "messages" parameter lists the framework messages 
          supported by the media gateway or endpoint. Messages are listed as 
          one or more comma-separated elements. Each element can either be a 
               single integer or two integers separated by a hyphen.  No 
               white space is allowed. The integers, which  identify messages  
          types are from the set "0" (null), "1" (initialize), "2" (voiceband 
          data), "3" (modem relay), "4" (text relay), "5" (fax relay). When 
          omitted, the default is 0-4.  
           
     Encoding considerations:  
          Like all other ITU V.150 media formats except modem relay, the MIME 
          audio/v150fw uses the RTP protocol. As such, it consists of packets 
          of binary data. The RTP payload is defined in the ITU V.150 
          recommendation. 
           
     Security considerations:   
          As with other RTP formats, it is possible to use IPSEC to  
          ensure the authenticity, integrity and privacy of this media format. 
          Since this media format is uncompressed, there is no  
          potential conflict between compression and encryption. Many 
          applications use modem relay between trusted network equipment and, 
          as such, may forego the use of IPSEC. When used with equipment in 
          untrusted areas, the impact of the V.150 framework messages is 
          limited to one session. Hence, any exposure from not encrypting this 
          media format is limited. 
            
          Resource usage by V.150 framework messages may be monitored to 
          prevent denial of service attacks. Since the resource utilization of 
          these messages is minimal, resource limiting is not precluded. 
            
          The MIME type contains no executable content that affects sessions or 
          session legs other than the ones in which the requester is a 
          participant. For these session legs, executable content in the form 
          of V.150 framework messages is well within the normal prerogatives of 
          the requester.

              IANA Registration of ITU V.150 Parameters and MIMEs 
                                         
                                         
                                         
           
          Since the content associated with this MIME type is well-defined and 
          not open-ended, it is not vulnerable to hiding data using 
          steganography.

This document does not impose any security considerations of its own, apart 
from the security considerations associated with each MIME type is contains. 
 
6.   IANA Considerations 
 
The entirety of this document is for IANA review and is limited to such 
information as pertinent to the IANA registration of MIME types and SDP 
parameters.
