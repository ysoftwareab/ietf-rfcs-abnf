<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> 
This document provides a terminology to be used when performing
performance test and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) switches and
controllers, including systems comprising groups
of controllers and Access Points.  The various wireless-specific
device nomenclature, as well as the definitions of configuration
parameters and test conditions that may be used to characterize the
performance of these devices, are provided. The document also defines
some of the metrics used during WLAN switch benchmarking. This
terminology is to be used in conjunction with the companion
methodology document.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Wireless LANs (WLANs) are deployed on a large scale in traditional
   enterprises, in commercial service offerings such as coffee shops,
   as well as vertical applications such as inventory
   management. These deployments initially used a distributed network of
   Access Points (APs).  Large WLAN deployments using distributed APs,
   however, introduce several issues. These include: an increased
   administrative burden, as the APs are individually IP-addressable;
   the need to ensure consistency of configuration across all APs; the difficulty
   of dealing with the dynamic nature of the WLAN medium and combating
   RF interference and noise; assuring seamless mobility for end users
   across the WLAN; and the more complex task of securing the WLAN
   against intrusion or unauthorized access.
</p>
<p>To address the above problems, vendors offer solutions
   that combine aspects of LAN switching, centralized control, and
   distributed wireless access in an architecture comprising a set of
   relatively simple Wireless termination points (WTPs) coupled to one
   or more Access controllers (ACs). The use of centralized control and
   monitoring simplifies many of the management and security issues
   noted above, as the WTPs can be configured and controlled as a group
   by the ACs, security policies can be administered on a WLAN-wide
   basis, and the RF domain can be monitored and controlled from a
   central location.
</p>
<p>Each vendor offering such a system needs a protocol between ACs and
   WTPs to support both
   centralized management and data transport functions. The general
   practice has been for vendors to use a proprietary protocol; however, the
   CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) protocol
   is being standardized by the IETF to provide a multi-vendor interoperable
   interface between WTPs and ACs. The CAPWAP protocol also defines a
   standardized WLAN architecture and mandatory functions (such as
   discovery) to enable a common functional model to be adopted across
   the vendor base.
</p>
<p>The ACs may perform both control plane and data plane functions
   within a WLAN. It is therefore of significant interest to benchmark
   their performance, as they have a material impact on the performance
   and perceived end-user experience of WLANs built around
   them. ACs may be benchmarked either as stand-alone entities, or in
   conjunction with the WTPs to which they connect. When ACs are
   benchmarked in conjunction with WTPs, the CAPWAP architectural model
   is used as a reference.
</p>
<p>This document defines the terminology to be used by vendors and users
   of switched WLAN devices when measuring and reporting performance
   characteristics of such devices. It extends existing terminology
   defined in RFC 2544 <a class='info' href='#RFC2544'>[RFC2544]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S. and J. McQuaid, &ldquo;Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> and subsequently extended in RFC 2285

   defined first, followed by specific terminology relating to data
   plane and control plane metrics.

Definitions of terms</h3>

<p>The terminology defined in this document is divided into three main
   categories: general WLAN definitions, WLAN data plane definitions,
   and WLAN control plane definitions.
</p>
<p>General WLAN definitions relate to the main physical and logical
   components of the WLAN architecture as defined by CAPWAP. These
   definitions are not specific to any particular metric or test
   procedure.
</p>
<p>WLAN data plane definitions relate to data frame forwarding
   functions within the WLAN architecture. 
</p>
<p>WLAN control plane definitions are associated with functions,
   metrics and test procedures that are connected with the management
   and control of system components. These control plane functions are
   usually unrelated to traffic forwarding, and handled by software on
   the AC and WTP.

Roaming</h3>

<p>Definition:

<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p> The process whereby a WLAN endstation moves from the coverage area
    of one WTP to the coverage area of another.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Discussion:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p> IEEE 802.11 is a connection-oriented protocol where the endstations
    (clients) associate, or connect, to a single WTP at a time;
    typically, the closest WTP to the endstation. When an endstation
    moves from the neighborhood of one WTP to the neighborhood of
    another, it attempts to maintain the best possible wireless link
    parameters (signal strength and bit error ratio) by disassociating
    from the former and associating with the latter. At this point, the
    endstation is said to have roamed from one WTP to another, and a
    roaming event is said to have taken place.
</p>
<p> The exact sequence of events during roaming varies considerably,
    based on security mode and other factors. However, the general
    process is as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the endstation makes a roaming decision based on some
            internal criteria, such as link quality or traffic load
</li>
<li>the endstation determines the new WTP with which it should
            associate or reassociate
</li>
<li>the endstation passively or actively disassociates with the
            current WTP, thereby interrupting data transfer
</li>
<li>the endstation performs a (re)association process with the
            new WTP
</li>
<li>data transfer resumes (i.e., the new WTP begins transferring
            data to the endstation)
</li>
</ul>

<p> Roaming MUST be applied only to movements of endstations within the
    same logical or physical wireless network; for example, the SSID
    MUST remain constant, and the security parameters MUST NOT change.
    The endstation IP address SHOULD NOT change, which usually confines
    roaming to a single subnet; however, if the WTPs or AC can proxy for
    the endstation on different subnet, then roaming can occur across
    subnets. Endstations that use DHCP MAY elect to renew the DHCP lease
    after each roaming event.
</p>
<p> Note that "roaming" in the WLAN context corresponds to "handover"
    or "handoff" in the cellular wireless context.

<p> This type of handoff is usually more complex than the simple case

<blockquote class="text">
<p> Endstations normally need to perform a complete security handshake
    (e.g., IEEE 802.11 authentication and association, EAP/TLS
    authentication, and key exchange) when they re-associate with a new
    WTP during a roaming event. This is because WLAN security
    mechanisms produce different keys on different WTPs, as the WTP MAC
    address and other information forms part of the key derivation
    mechanism. This can greatly extend the time required to complete a
    roaming event, because EAP handshakes are usually long and complex.
</p>
<p> To reduce the roaming time, the IEEE 802.11 standard permits a
    shortcut to be implemented by endstations: prior to the actual
    roam, the endstation may complete an authentication with the target
    WTP via the WTP with which the endstation is currently associated.
    Essentially the authentication frames are received over the
    wireless medium by the current WTP and then tunneled over the wired
    infrastructure to the target WTP.
</p>
<p> When the roam event actually occurs, the endstation can bypass the
    entire EAP authentication process and skip directly to IEEE 802.1X
    key derivation, using the parameters (such as keying material) that
    have already been negotiated. This is known as preauthentication.

<p>  WLANs are particularly subject to congestion issues, as not only

     shared by multiple endstations and WTPs. It is therefore essential
     to support differential handling of traffic based on their
     individual QoS requirements. For example, voice traffic (which is
     highly delay sensitive but does not occupy much bandwidth) should
     be permitted to take precedence over data traffic, whenever both

<p>  QoS differentiation may be realized in many different ways. A

<p> Traffic flows such as voice and video need to adhere to a certain
    level of service quality in order for the application layer to

<p> QoS thresholds vary depending on the needs of the application; for

    is an average latency of 60 msec, a maximum jitter of 30 msec, a
    maximum packet loss of 1%, and a maximum burst loss of 1 packet.
    The specific QoS threshold used for a test MUST be reported.
</p>
<p> Once a QoS threshold is defined, the test may be conducted by

<blockquote class="text">
<p> A busy enterprise network, particularly one containing a number of
    VoIP handsets (i.e., mobile phones) may see a large number of
    roaming events per second as devices move between WTP coverage
    areas. In such situations it is essential to ensure that roaming
    takes place without failures (e.g., failed reassociations, or
    excessively delayed reassociations). This is particularly true in
    the case of VoIP handsets, where a roaming failure can cause
    dropped calls or degraded voice quality. The maximum roaming rate
    that can be sustained by the WLAN infrastructure is therefore of
    significant interest.
</p>
<p> The roaming rate measurement is invalidated by the presence of
    roaming failures. The failure of the association handshakes with
    the new WTP is relatively straightforward to determine (as the
    handshakes themselves convey status messages and have predefined
    timeouts and retry limits), but the length of time to wait for
    resumption of data service is not well defined. A delay threshold
    is therefore defined as part of the measurement process, and a roam
    is considered to have failed if this threshold is exceeded.
</p>
<p> The distribution of endstations among WTPs within the DUT/SUT
    usually has material impact on the roaming rate and therefore SHOULD
    be specified by the measurement procedure.

Roaming delay</h3>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Discussion:

<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p> Movement of an endstation between WTP coverage areas, which causes
    roaming events to occur, requires some finite time to complete,
    during which data traffic may be interrupted. The duration of such
    data traffic interruption has a material impact on the perceived
    capability of the WLAN to support mobile endstations. For instance,
    an excessive period of traffic interruption may cause voice calls
    to be dropped or TCP connections to close their windows. A
    measurement of roaming delay is thus a useful component of WLAN
    infrastructure performance.
</p>
<p> The roaming delay is ideally measured from the point at which the
    roaming decision is made to the point at which data service is
    completely restored (the roam completes without a roaming failure).
    With reference to the WLAN infrastructure, therefore, the roaming
    delay is the time from the roaming decision to the first valid
    downstream data frame delivered to the endstation by the new WTP.
</p>
<p> In some situations the exact point at which the roaming decision is
    made cannot be accurately ascertained, such as when using actual
    endstations rather than dedicated test equipment during the
    measurement process. In this case, the roaming delay is measured as
    the time between the last valid data frame delivered to the
    endstation by the old WTP to the first valid data frame delivered
    to the endstation by the new WTP. The use of this alternative
    measurement process MUST be noted along with the measurement
    results.
</p>
<p> In both cases, delivery of a data frame implies that the endstation
    has received the data frame without error and has issued, or has
    been observed to issue, an IEEE 802.11 acknowledgement packet for
    that data frame.
</p>
<p> A roaming event MUST NOT be counted towards roaming delay
    measurements if a roaming failure occurs.

<p>  The availability of the WLAN infrastructure is of interest when

     In fact, to ensure uninterrupted availability, vendors often
     provide redundant elements in their systems (e.g., a backup AC to
     take over when the primary AC fails). Further, if an AC is manually
     reset, it should recover from the reset condition, reconnect all
     the attached WTPs, and restore service to endstations as rapidly
     as possible; this avoids issues such as dropped voice calls and
     failed TCP sessions.
