Internet-Draft          SCTP authentication chunk              June 2005


1.  Introduction

   SCTP uses 32 bit verification tags to protect itself against blind
   attackers.  These values are not changed during the lifetime of an
   SCTP association.

   Looking at new SCTP extensions there is the need to have a method of
   proving that an SCTP chunk(s) was really sent by the original peer
   that started the association and not by a malicious attacker.

   Using TLS as defined in RFC3436 [6] does not help here because it
   only secures SCTP user data.

   Therefore an SCTP extension is presented in this document which
   allows an SCTP sender to sign chunks using a shared key between the
   sender and receiver.  The receiver can then verify, that the chunks
   are sent from the sender and not from a malicious attacker.

   This extension also provides a mechanism for deriving a shared key
   for each association.  This association shared key is derived from a
   endpoint pair shared key, which is  preconfigured and might be empty.

2.  Conventions

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
   they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC2119 [4].

3.  New Parameter Types

   This section defines the new parameter types that will be used to
   negotiate the authentication during association setup.  Figure 1
   illustrates the new parameter types.

   Parameter Type  Parameter Name
   --------------------------------------------------------------
   0x8002          Random Parameter (RANDOM)
   0x8003          Chunk List Parameter (CHUNKS)
   0x8004          Requested HMAC Algorithm Parameter (HMAC-ALGO)

                                 Figure 1

   It should be noted that the parameter format requires the receiver to
   ignore the parameter and continue processing if it is not understood.
   This is accomplished as described in RFC2960 [5] section 3.2.1. by
   the use of the upper bit of the parameter type.

      0x8002.

   Parameter Length: 2 bytes (unsigned integer) This value is the length
      of the Random Number plus 4.

   Random Number: n bytes (unsigned integer) This value represents an
      arbitrary Random Number in network byte order.

   The RANDOM parameter MUST be included once in the INIT or INIT-ACK
   chunk if the sender wants to send or receive authenticated chunks.

3.2  Chunk List Parameter (CHUNKS)

   This parameter is used to specify which chunk types are required to
   be sent authenticated by the peer.

   Parameter Type: 2 bytes (unsigned integer) This value MUST be set to
      0x8003.

   Parameter Length: 2 bytes (unsigned integer) This value is the number
      of listed Chunk Types plus 4.

   Chunk Type n: 1 byte (unsigned integer) Each Chunk Type listed is
      required to be authenticated when sent by the peer.

   The CHUNKS parameter MUST be included once in the INIT or INIT-ACK
   chunk if the sender wants to receive authenticated chunks.  Its
   maximum length is 260 bytes.

   The chunk types for INIT, INIT-ACK, COOKIE-ECHO, COOKIE-ACK,
   SHUTDOWN-COMPLETE and AUTH chunks MUST not be listed in the CHUNKS
   parameter.  However, if a CHUNKS parameter is received then the types
   for INIT, INIT-ACK, COOKIE-ECHO, COOKIE-ACK, SHUTDOWN-COMPLETE and
   AUTH chunks MUST be ignored.

3.3  Requested HMAC Algorithm Parameter (HMAC-ALGO)

   This parameter is used to list the HMAC identifiers the peer has to
   use.

   This section defines a new error cause that will be sent if an AUTH
   chunk is received with an unsupported HMAC identifier.  Figure 6

5.1  Authentication Chunk (AUTH)

   This chunk is used to hold the result of the HMAC calculation.

   Type: 1 byte (unsigned integer) This value MUST be set to 0x83 for
      all AUTH-chunks.

   Flags: 1 byte (unsigned integer) Set to zero on transmit and ignored
      on receipt.

   Length: 2 bytes (unsigned integer) This value holds the length of the
      HMAC plus 8.

   HMAC Identifier: 4 bytes (unsigned integer) This value describes
      which message digest is being used.  Figure 5 shows the currently
      defined values.

   HMAC: n bytes (unsigned integer) This hold the result of the HMAC
      calculation.

   The control chunk AUTH can appear at most once in an SCTP packet.
   All control and data chunks which are placed after the AUTH chunk in
   the packet are sent in an authenticated way.  Those chunks placed in
   a packet before the AUTH chunk are not authenticated.

6.  Procedures

6.1  Establishment of an association shared key

   An SCTP endpoint willing to receive or send authenticated chunks has
   to send one RANDOM parameter in its INIT or INIT-ACK chunk.  The



Tuexen, et al.          Expires December 14, 2005               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          SCTP authentication chunk              June 2005


   RANDOM parameter SHOULD contain a 32 byte random number.  This random
   number is handled like the verification tag in case of INIT
   collisions.  Therefore each endpoint knows its own random number and
   the peers random number after the association has been established.

   An SCTP endpoint has a list of chunks it only accepts if they are
   received in an authenticated way.  This list is included in the INIT
   and INIT-ACK and MAY be omitted if it is empty.  Since this list is
   for an endpoint there is no problem in case of INIT collision.

   Each SCTP endpoint MUST include in the INIT and INIT-ACK a HMAC-ALGO
   parameter containing a list of HMAC Identifiers it requests the peer
   to use.  The receiver of a HMAC-ALGO parameter SHOULD use the first
   listed algorithm it supports.  The HMAC algorithm based on SHA-1 MUST
   be supported and included in the HMAC-ALGO parameter.  An SCTP
   endpoint MUST not change the parameters listed in the HMAC-ALGO
   parameter during the lifetime of the endpoint.

   Both enpoints of an association have an endpoint pair shared key
   which is a byte vector and preconfigured or established by another
   mechanism.  If it is not preconfigured or established by another
   mechanism it is set to the empty byte vector.

   From this endpoint pair shared key the association shared key is
   computed by concatenating the endpoint pair shared key with the
   random numbers exchanged in the INIT and INIT-ACK.  This is performed
   by selecting the smaller random number and concatenating it to the
   endpoint pair shared key.  Then concatenating the larger of the
   random numbers to that.  If both random numbers are equal they may be
   concatenated to the endpoint pair key in any order.  The
   concatenation is performed on byte vectors representing all numbers
   in network byte order.  The result is the association shared key.

6.2  Sending authenticated chunks

   Chunks can only be authenticated when the SCTP association is in the
   ESTABLISHED state.  Both endpoints MUST send all those chunks
   authenticated where this has been requested by the peer.  The other
   chunks MAY be sent authenticated.

   To send chunks in an authenticated way, the sender has to include
   these chunks after an AUTH chunk.  This means that a sender MUST
   bundle chunks in order to authenticate them.

   The sender MUST calculate the MAC using the hash function H as
   described by the MAC Identifier and the shared association key K. The
   'data' used for the computation of the AUTH-chunk is given by
   Figure 10 and all chunks that are placed after the AUTH chunk in the

   SCTP packet.  RFC2104 [3] can be used as a guideline for generating

                                 Figure 10

   Please note that all fields are in network byte order and that the
   field which will contain the complete HMAC is filled with zeroes.
   The length of the field shown as 0 is the length of the HMAC
   described by the HMAC Identifier.

   The sender fills the HMAC into the HMAC field and sends the packet.

6.3  Receiving authenticated chunks

   The receiver has a list of chunk types which it expects to be
   received only after an AUTH-chunk.  This list has been sent to the
   peer during the association setup.  It MUST silently discard these
   chunks if they are not placed after an AUTH chunk in the packet.

   The receiver MUST use the HMAC algorithm indicated in the HMAC
   Identifier field.  If this algorithm is not known the AUTH chunk and
   all chunks after it MUST be discarded and an ERROR chunk SHOULD be
   sent with the error cause defined in Section 4.1.

   The receiver now performs the same calculation as described for the
   sender based on Figure 10.  If the result of the calculation is the
   same as given in the HMAC field, all chunks following the AUTH chunk
   are processed.  If the field does not match the result of the
   calculation all these chunks MUST be silently discarded.

   It should be noted that if the receiver wants to tear down an
   association in an authenticated way only, the handling of malformed
   packets should be in tune with this.

7.  Examples

   This section gives examples of message exchanges for association
   setup.

Internet-Draft          SCTP authentication chunk              June 2005


   The simplest way of using the extension described in this document is
   given by the following message exchange.

       ---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------->
       <------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------
       -------------------- COOKIE-ECHO -------------------->
       <-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------

   Please note that the CHUNKS parameter is optional in the INIT and
   INIT-ACK.

   If the server wants to receive DATA chunks in an authenticated way,
   the following message exchange is possible:

       ---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------->
       <------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------
       --------------- COOKIE-ECHO; AUTH; DATA ------------->
       <----------------- COOKIE-ACK; SACK ------------------

   Please note that if the endpoint pair shared key depends on the
   client and the server and that it is only known by the upper layer
   this message exchange requires an upper layer intervention between
   the processing of the COOKIE-ECHO chunk (COMMUNICATION-UP
   notification followed by the presentation of the endpoint pair shared
   key by the upper layer to the SCTP stack) and the processing of the
   AUTH and DATA chunk.  If this intervention is not possible due to
   limitations of the API the server might discard the AUTH and DATA
   chunk making a retransmission of the DATA chunk necessary.  If the
   same endpoint pair shared key is used for multiple endpoints and does
   not depend on the client this intervention might not be necessary.

8.  IANA Considerations

   A chunk type for the AUTH chunk has to be assigned by IANA.  It is
   suggested to use the value given above.

   Parameter types have to be assigned for the RANDOM, CHUNKS, and HMAC-
   ALGO parameter by IANA.  It is suggested to use the values given
   above.

   HMAC Identifiers have to be maintained by IANA.  Three initial values
   should be assigned by IANA as described above.

9.  Security Considerations

   This section is still incomplete.

   If no endpoint pair shared key is used an attacker which captures the

   association setup message exchange can later insert arbitrary packets
   in an authenticated way.  However, if the attacker did not capture
   this initial message exchange he can not successfully inject chunks
   which are required to be authenticated.

   If an enpoint pair shared key is used even a true man in the middle
   can not inject chunks which are required to be authenticated even if
   he intercepts the initial message exchange.

   Because SCTP has already a mechanism built-in that handles the
   reception of duplicated chunks the presented solution makes use of
   this functionality and does not provide a method to avoid replay
   attacks by itself.  Of course, this only works within each SCTP
   association.  Therefore a separate shared key is used for each SCTP
   association to handle replay attacks covering multiple SCTP
   associations.
