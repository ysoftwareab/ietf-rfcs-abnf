Abstract

   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6ND) Route Information Option (RIO)
   defines an 8-bit flags field.  This document requests IANA to create

1.  Introduction

   The Route Information Option (RIO) [RFC4191] in IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery (IPv6ND) messages [RFC4861][RFC8200] defines an 8-bit flag
   field.  The purpose of this document is to request IANA to create a
   new registry for the RIO flags to avoid potential conflicts.

2.  RIO Flags

   The IPv6 ND RIO specified in [RFC4191] and as updated by
   [I-D.templin-6man-rio-redirect] contains the following 8-bit flag
   field format:

          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |S|Res|Prf|Resvd|
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In this field, bit 0 is the "Solicited (S)" flag
   [I-D.templin-6man-rio-redirect], bits 3-4 encode a 2-bit Route
   Preference codepoint, and the remaining bits are reserved for future
   use.

   Future use of bits that are currently reserved must be coordinated to
   avoid conflicts.

3.  Updates to RFC4191

   This document updates [RFC4191] to include the new IANA
   Considerations text specified below.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to create a new registry for IPv6 ND RIO flags.
   This should include the following initial values:

         +---------------+---------------------------------+-----------+
         | RIO Flag Bits | Description                     | Reference |
         +---------------+---------------------------------+-----------+
         | 0             | S - Solicited Flag              | [1]       |
         | 1-2           | Reserved                        | [RFC4191] |
         | 3-4           | Prf - a 2-bit Route Preference  | [RFC4191] |
         | 5-7           | Reserved                        | [RFC4191] |
         +---------------+---------------------------------+-----------+

   (Where Reference [1] is [I-D.templin-6man-rio-redirect]).

   The assignment of new flags in the RIO flags field require Standards
   Action or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   The registry for these flags should be added to:
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
