          NOTE: The information in the Diagnostic-Code field may be somewhat 
          redundant with that from the Status field. The Status field is 
          needed so that any DSN, regardless of origin, may be understood by 
          any user agent or gateway that parses DSNs. Since the Status code 
          will sometimes be less precise than the actual transport diagnostic 
          code, the Diagnostic-Code field is provided to retain the latter 
          information. Such information may be useful in a trouble ticket sent 
          to the administrator of the Reporting MTA, or when tunneling foreign 
          non-delivery reports through DSNs.
