      OAM for LPWAN using Static Context Header Compression (SCHC)
                    draft-barthel-lpwan-oam-schc-02

Abstract

   With IP protocols now generalizing to constrained networks, users
   expect to be able to Operate, Administer and Maintain them with the
   familiar tools and protocols they already use on less constrained
   networks.

   OAM uses specific messages sent into the data plane to measure some
   parameters of a network.  Most of the time, no explicit values are
   sent is these messages.  Network parameters are obtained from the
   analysis of these specific messages.

   This can be used:

   *  To detect if a host is up or down.

   *  To measure the RTT and its variation over time.

   *  To learn the path used by packets to reach a destination.

   OAM in LPWAN is a little bit trickier since the bandwidth is limited
   and extra traffic added by OAM can introduce perturbation on regular
   transmission.

   Two scenarios can be investigated:

   *  OAM coming from internet.  In that case, the NGW should act as a
      proxy and handle specifically the OAM traffic.

   *  OAM coming from LPWAN devices: This can be included into regular
      devices but some specific devices may be installed in the LPWAN
      network to measure its quality.

   The primitive functionalities of OAM are achieved with the ICMPv6
   protocol.

   ICMPv6 defines messages that inform the source of IPv6 packets of
   errors during packet delivery.  It also defines the Echo Request/
   Reply messages that are used for basic network troubleshooting (ping
   command).  ICMPv6 messages are transported on IPv6.

   This document describes how basic OAM is performed on Low Power Wide
   Area Networks (LPWANs) by compressing ICMPv6/IPv6 headers and by
   protecting the LPWAN network and the Device from undesirable ICMPv6
   traffic.

1.  Introduction

   The primitive functionalities of OAM [RFC6291] are achieved with the
   ICMPv6 protocol.

   ICMPv6 [RFC4443] is a companion protocol to IPv6 [RFC8200].

   [RFC4443] defines a generic message format.  This format is used for
   messages to be sent back to the source of an IPv6 packet to inform it
   about errors during packet delivery.

   More specifically, [RFC4443] defines 4 error messages: Destination
   Unreachable, Packet Too Big, Time Exceeded and Parameter Problem.

   [RFC4443] also defines the Echo Request and Echo Reply messages,
   which provide support for the ping application.

   Other ICMPv6 messages are defined in other RFCs, such as an extended
   format of the same messages [RFC4884] and other messages used by the
   Neighbor Discovery Protocol [RFC4861].

   This document focuses on using Static Context Header Compression
   (SCHC) to compress [RFC4443] messages that need to be transmitted
   over the LPWAN network, and on having the LPWAN gateway proxying the
   Device to save it the unwanted traffic.

   LPWANs' salient characteristics are described in [RFC8376].

2.  Terminology

   This draft re-uses the Terminology defined in [RFC8724].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use cases

   In the LPWAN architecture, we can distinguish the following cases:

   *  the Device is the originator of an Echo Request message, and
      therefore the destination of the Echo Reply message.

   *  the Device is the destination of an Echo Request message, and
      therefore the purported source of an Echo Reply message.

   *  the Device is the (purported) source of an ICMP error message,
      mainly in response to an incorrect incoming IPv6 message, or in
      response to a ping request.  In this case, as much as possible,
      the core SCHC C/D should act as a proxy and originate the ICMP
      message, so that the Device and the LPWAN network are protected
      from this unwanted traffic.

   *  the Device is the destination of the ICMP message, mainly in
      response to a packet sent by the Device to the network that
      generates an error.  In this case, we want the ICMP message to
      reach the Device, and this document describes in Section 4.4.1
      what SCHC compression should be applied.

   These cases are further described in Section 4.

4.  Detailed behavior

4.1.  Device does a ping

   If a ping request is generated by a Device, then SCHC compression
   applies.

   The format of an ICMPv6 Echo Request message is described in
   Figure 1, with Type=128 and Code=0.

              Figure 1: ICMPv6 Echo Request message format

   If we assume that one rule will be devoted to compressing Echo
   Request messages, then Type and Code are known in the rule to be 128
   and 0 and can therefore be elided with the not-sent CDA.

   Checksum can be reconstructed with the compute-checksum CDA and
   therefore is not transmitted.

   [RFC4443] states that Identifier and Sequence Number are meant to
   "aid in matching Echo Replies to this Echo Request" and that they
   "may be zero".  Data is "zero or more bytes of arbitrary data".

   We recommend that Identifier be zero, Sequence Number be a counter on
   3 bits, and Data be zero bytes (absent).  Therefore, Identifier is
   elided with the not-sent CDA, Sequence Number is transmitted on 3
   bits with the LSB CDA and no Data is transmitted.

   The transmission cost of the Echo Request message is therefore the
   size of the Rule Id + 3 bits.

   When the destination receives the Echo Request message, it will
   respond back with a Echo Reply message.  This message bears the same
   format as the Echo Request message but with Type = 129 (see
   Figure 1).

   [RFC4443] states that the Identifier, Sequence Number and Data fields
   of the Echo Reply message shall contain the same values as the
   invoking Echo Request message.  Therefore, a rule shall be used
   similar to that used for compressing the Echo Request message.

   TODO: how about a shared rule for Echo Request and Echo Reply with an
   LSB(1) CDA on the Type field?  Or exploiting the Up/Down direction
   field in the rule?

4.1.1.  Rule example

   The following rule gives an example of a SCHC compression.  The type
   can be elided if the direction is taken into account.  Identifier is
   ignored and generated as 0 at decompression.  This implies that only
   one single ping can be launched at any given time on a device.
   Finally, only the least significant 8 bits of the sequence number are
   sent on the LPWAN, allowing a serie of 255 consecutive pings.

4.2.  Device is ping'ed

   If the Device is ping'ed (i.e., is the destination of an Echo Request
   message), the default behavior is to avoid propagating the Echo
   Request message over the LPWAN.

   This is done by proxying the ping request on the core SCHC C/D.  This
   requires to add an action when the rule is selected.  Instead of been
   processed by the compressor, the packet description is processed by a
   ping proxy.  The rule is used for the selection, so CDAs are not
   necessary.

   The resulting behavior is shown on Figure 2 and described below:

        Table 2: Example of compression rule for a ping to a device

   In this example, type and code are elided, the identifer has to be
   sent, and the sequence number is limited to one byte.

4.3.  Device is the source of an ICMPv6 error message

   As stated in [RFC4443], a node should generate an ICMPv6 message in
   response to an IPv6 packet that is malformed or which cannot be
   processed due to some incorrect field value.

   The general intent of this document is to spare both the Device and
   the LPWAN network this un-necessary traffic.  The incorrect packets
   should be caught at the core SCHC C/D and the ICMPv6 notification
   should be sent back from there.

    Figure 3: Example of ICMPv6 error message sent back to the Internet

   Figure 3 shows an example of an IPv6 packet trying to reach a Device.
   Let's assume that the port number used as destination port is not
   "known" (needs better definition) from the core SCHC C/D.  Instead of
   sending the packet over the LPWAN and having this packet rejected by
   the Device, the core SCHC C/D issues an ICMPv6 error message
   "Destination Unreachable" (Type 1) with Code 1 ("Port Unreachable")
   on behalf of the Device.

   In that case the SCHC C/D acts as a router and MUST have a routable
   IPv6 address to generate an ICMPv6 message. when compressing a packet
   containing an IPv6 header, no compression rules are found and: * if a
   rule contains some extension headers, a parameter problem may be
   generated (type 4), * no rules contains the IPv6 prefix, a no route
   to destination ICMPv6 message (type 0, code 0) may be generated, * a
   prefix is found, but no devIID matches, a address unreachable ICMPv6
   message (type 0, code 3) may be generated, * a device IPv6 address is
   found, but no port matches, a port unreachable ICMPv6 message (type
   0, code 4) may be generated,

   TODO: This assumes that all ports that the Device listens to will be
   matched by a SCHC rule.  Is this the basic assumption of SCHC that
   all packets that do not match a rule are rejected?  If yes, why do
   have fragmentation also for uncompressed packets?

   TODO: discuss the various Type/Code that are expected to be generated
   in response to various errors.

4.4.  Device is the destination of an ICMPv6 error message

   In this situation, we assume that a Device has been configured to
   send information to a server on the Internet.  If this server becomes
   no longer accessible, an ICMPv6 message will be generated back
   towards the Device by an intermediate router.  This information can
   be useful to the Device, for example for reducing the reporting rate
   in case of periodic reporting of data.  Therefore, we compress the
   ICMPv6 message using SCHC and forward it to the Device over the
   LPWAN.

    Figure 4: Example of ICMPv6 error message sent back to the Device

   Figure 4 illustrates this behavior.  The ICMPv6 error message is
   compressed as described in Section 4.4.1 and forwarded over the LPWAN
   to the Device.

   [RFC4443] states that Type can take the values 1 to 4, and Code can
   be set to values between 0 and 6.  Value is unused for the
   Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages.  It contains the
   MTU for the Packet Too Big message and a pointer to the byte causing
   the error for the Parameter Error message.  Therefore, Value is never
   expected to be greater than 1280 in LPWAN networks.

   The following generic rule can therefore be used to compress all
   ICMPv6 error messages as defined today.  More specific rules can also
   be defined to achieve better compression of some error messages.

   The Type field can be associated to a matching list [1, 2, 3, 4] and
   is therefore compressed down to 2 bits.  Code can be reduced to 3
   bits using the LSB CDA.  Value can be sent on 11 bits using the LSB
   CDA, but if the Device is known to send smaller packets, then the
   size of this field can be further reduced.

   By [RFC4443], the rest of the ICMPv6 message must contain as much as
   possible of the IPv6 offending (invoking) packet that triggered this
   ICMPv6 error message.  This information is used to try and identify
   the SCHC rule that was used to decompress the offending IPv6 packet.
   If the rule can be found then the Rule Id is added at the end of the
   compressed ICMPv6 message.  Otherwise the compressed packet ends with
   the compressed Value field.

   [RFC4443] states that the "ICMPv6 error message MUST include as much
   of the IPv6 offending (invoking) packet ... as possible".  In order
   to comply with this requirement, if there is enough information in
   the incoming ICMPv6 message for the core SCHC C/D to identify the
   rule that has been used to decompress the erroneous IPv6 packet, this
   Rule Id must be sent in the compressed ICMPv6 message to the Device.
   TODO: the erroneous IPv6 packet header (not just the Rule Id) should
   be sent back.  This includes the Rule Id and the compression residue.
   This means the SCHC C/D uses the context backwards (in the reverse
   direction).  How does the Device know it must also use the context
   backwards?

   TODO: how does one know that the "payload" of a compressed-header
   packet is in fact another compressed header?

5.  Traceroute

   The traceroute6 program sends successive probe packets destined to a
   chosen target but with the Hop Limit value successively incremented
   from the initial value 1.

   It expects to receive a "Time Exceeded" (Type = 3) "Hop Limit" (Code
   = 0) ICMPv6 error message back from the successive routers along the
   path to the destination.

   The probe packet is usually a UDP datagram, but can also be a TCP
   datagram or even an ICMPv6 message.  The destination port is chosen
   in the unassigned range in hope that the destination, when eventually
   reached, will respond with a "Destination Unreachable" (Type = 1)
   "Port Unreachable" (Code = 4) ICMPv6 error message.

   It is not anticipated that a Device will want to traceroute a
   destination on the Internet.

   By contrast, a host on the Internet may attempt to traceroute an IPv6
   address that is assigned to an LPWAN device.  This is described in
   Figure 6.

          |           |            | Hop Limit=2, Dest Port=XXX |
          |           |            |<---------------------------|
          |           |            |                            |
          |           |            |--------------------------->|
          |           |            |  ICMPv6 Port Unreachable   |

            Figure 6: Example of traceroute to the LPWAN Device

   When the probe packet first reaches the core SCHC C/D, its remaining
   Hop Limit is 1.  The core SCHC C/D will respond back with a "Time
   Exceeded" (Type = 3) "Hop Limit" (Code = 0) ICMPv6 error message.
   Later on, when the probe packet reaches the code SCHC C/D with a Hop
   Limit value of 2, the core SCHC C/D will, as explained in
   Section 4.3, answer back with a "Destination Unreachable" (Type = 1)
   "Port Unreachable" (Code = 4) ICMPv6 error message.  This is what the
   traceroute6 command expects.  Therefore, the traceroute6 command will
   work with LPWAN IPv6 destinations, except for the time displayed for
   the destination, which is actually the time to its proxy.

   However, if the probe packet happens to hit a port that matches a
   SCHC rule for that Device, the packet will be compressed with this
   rule and sent over the LPWAN, which is unfortunate.  Forwarding of

   packets to the Device over the LPWAN should only be done from
   authenticated/trusted sources anyway.  Rate-limitation on top of
   authentication will mitigate this nuisance.
