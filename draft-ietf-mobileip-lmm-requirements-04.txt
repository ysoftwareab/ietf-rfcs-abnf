         Abstract 
          
            This document describes requirements for Localized Mobility 
            Management (LMM) for Mobile IP and Mobile IPv6 protocols.   
            These requirements are intended to guide the design of a protocol  
            specification for LMM.  Localized Mobility Management, in general, 
            introduces enhancements to Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 to 
            reduce the amount of latency in binding updates sent to the Home 
            Agent and, for route-optimization, Correspondent Nodes, upon 
            Care of Address change. In addition, LMM seeks to reduce the 
            amount of signaling over the global Internet when a mobile 
            node traverses within a defined local domain.  The identified  
            requirements are essential for localized mobility management  
            functionality. They are intended to be used as a guide for  
            analysis on the observed benefits over the identified requirements  
            for architecting and deploying LMM schemes.

         1.0 Introduction 
          
            In order to meet the demands of real-time applications and the expectations  
            of future wireless users for service level quality similar to the one of  
            wireline users, IP based mobility management is facing a number of technical  
            challenges in terms of performance and scalability [4, 5, 6].  These manifest  
            themselves as increased latencies in the control signaling between a Mobile  
            Node and its peer entities, namely the Home Agent (HA) and its Corresponding  
            Nodes (CNs). 
          
            In the base Mobile IP protocol [3], movement between two subnets  
            requires that the Mobile Node obtain a new Care of Address in the  
            new subnet. This allows the Mobile Node to receive traffic on the  
            new subnet. In order for the routing change to become effective,  
            however, the Mobile Node must issue a binding update (also known in  
            Mobile IPv4 as a Home Agent registration) to the Home Agent so that  
            the Home Agent can change the routing from the previous subnet to  
            the new subnet. The binding update establishes a host route on the  
            Home Agent between the Mobile Node's Home Address and its new Care  
            of Address. In addition, if route optimization is in use [3], the  
            Mobile Node may also issue binding updates to Correspondent Nodes to  
            allow them to send traffic directly to the new Care of Address  
            rather than tunneling their traffic through the Home Agent. 
          
            Traffic destined for the Mobile Node is sent to the old Care of  
            Address and is, effectively, dropped until the Home Agent processes  
            the MIPv6 Binding Update or MIPv4 Home Agent Registration. If the  
            Mobile Node is at some geographical and topological distance away

            from the Home Agent and Correspondent Nodes, the amount of time  
            involved in sending the binding updates may be greater than 100  
            hundred milliseconds. This latency in routing update may cause  
            some packets for the Mobile Node to be lost at the old Access Router. 
            Recently, Mobile IP has been extended by certain local mobility mechanisms, 
            aiming to alleviate the above performance limitations; they are identified  
            as hierarchical/regional or more generically Localized Mobility Management  
            (LMM).  LMM schemes allow the Mobile Node to continue receiving traffic on 
            the new subnet without any change in the Home Agent or Correspondent  
            Node binding. The latency involved in updating the Care of Address bindings  
            at far geographical and topological distances is eliminated or reduced until  
            such time as the Mobile Node is in a position to manage the latency cost.  
           
            Having provided some motivation and brief summary of the underlying 
            principles of LMM, it is important to enumerate goals for LMM. 
          
          
            Goals for LMM: 
          
          
              -   reduce the signaling induced by changes in the  
                  point of attachment due to the movement of a host; 
                   reduction in signaling delay will minimize  
                   packet loss and possible session loss; 
          
              -   reduce the usage of air-interface and network  
                   resources for mobility; 
          
               -   reduce the processing overhead at the peer nodes, 
                   thereby improving protocol scalability; 
          
              -   avoid or minimize the changes of, or impact to the  
                   Mobile Node, Home Agent or the Correspondent Node; 
                       
              -   avoid creating single points of failure; 
               
              -   simplify the network design and provisioning  
                  for enabling LMM capability in a network; 
                       
              -   allow progressive LMM deployment capabilities. 
          
            Identifying a solid set of requirements that will render the 
            protocol internals, for some LMM scheme, robust enough to  
            cater for the aforementioned considerations becomes essential 
            in designing a widely accepted solution.  The remainder of this 
            document present a set of requirements that encompass essential 
            considerations for the design of an LMM scheme.  It is with this 
            foundation that we can seek to ensure that the resulting LMM 
            solution will best preserve the fundamental philosophies and  
            architectural principles of the Internet in practice today.

         2.0 Terminology 
          
            Please also see [7] for mobility terminology used in this document. 
          
             
         3.0 LMM Requirements 
          
            This section describes the requirements for a LMM solution.  The 
            requirements are relevant to both Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6. 
          
          
         3.1 Intra-domain mobility  
          
            LMM is introduced to minimize the signaling traffic to the Home Agent  
            and/or Correspondent Node(s) for intra-domain mobility (within a  
            Local Coverage Area).  This is the fundamental reason for 
            introducing localized mobility management extensions to core Mobile  
            IPv6.   
              
            In the LMM infrastructure a Correspondent Node or Home Agent outside 
            the administration domain MUST always be able to address the mobile 
            host by the same IP address, so that from the point of view of hosts 
            outside the administration domain, the IP address of the mobile host 
            remains fixed regardless of any changes in the Mobile Node's subnet. 
          
          
         3.2 Security 
          
         3.2.1 LMM protocol MUST provide for "security provisioning" within the  
               respective local coverage area. 
          
          
            The security of exchanging LMM specific information and signaling MUST 
            be ensured.  Security provisioning includes protecting the integrity,  
            confidentiality, and authenticity of the transfer of LMM specific  
            information within the administration domain.  If applicable, replay 
            protection MUST exist mutually between the LMM agents. 
          
             
         3.2.2 LMM protocol MUST NOT interfere with the security provisioning that 
               exists between the Home Agent and the Mobile Node. 
                
         3.2.3 LMM protocol MUST NOT interfere with the security provisioning that 
               exists between the Correspondent Node and the Mobile Node. 
          
         3.2.4 LMM protocol MUST NOT introduce new security holes or the possibility 
               for DOS-style attacks.

         3.3 Induced LMM functional requirements 
          
         3.3.1 Any Localized Mobility Management protocol MUST NOT inject 
               any additional functionality over base  Mobility [2, 3] at the 
               Home Agent or any of its peer CNs.  Thus, the LMM framework 
               MUST NOT add any modifications or extensions to the Correspondent  
               Node(s) and Home Agent. It is essential to minimize  
               the involvement of the Mobile Node in routing beyond what is in  
               the basic MIP and MIpv6 protocol. Preferences, load balancing, and  
               other complex schemes requiring heavy mobile node involvement 
               in the mobility management task SHOULD BE avoided. 
          
          
         3.3.2 Non-LMM-aware routers, hosts, Home Agents, and Mobile Nodes 
               MUST be able to interoperate with LMM agents. 
          
          
         3.3.3 The LMM framework MUST NOT increase the number of messages between 
               the mobile host and the respective Correspondent Node(s) and Home  
               Agent.  Indeed, the LMM framework MUST minimize the global 
               signaling between the MN and its peers.  The amount 
               of regional signaling MUST NOT surpass the amount of global 
               signaling that would have otherwise occurred if LMM were not  
               present. 
           
         3.4 Scalability, Reliability, and Performance 
          
         3.4.1 The LMM complexity MUST increase at most linearly with the  
               size of the local domain and the number of Mobile Nodes. 
          
          
         3.4.2 Any Localized Mobility Management protocol MUST assure that 
               that LMM routing state scales at most linearly with the number 
               of Mobile Nodes registered, and that the increase in routing 
               state is confined to those ARs/ANRs involved in implementing 
               the LMM protocol at hand.  This would involve MIP-specific  
               routing state as binding caches in addition to standard 
               routing table host routes. While host routes cannot be  
               eliminated by any mobility management protocol including 
               base IP mobility, any LMM protocol MUST keep the number of 
               host routes to a minimum.

         INTERNET DRAFT  Localized Mobility Management Requirements October 2003 
          
          
         3.4.3 The LMM framework MUST NOT introduce additional  points of failure in  
               the network.  The current access router would be excluded from 
               this requirement.   
                
         3.4.4 The LMM framework MUST NOT interfere with the basic IP mobility 
               performance of a mobile host communications with a Correspondent  
               Node(s). 
          
          
         3.4.5 Scalable expansion of the network 
          
            The LMM framework MUST allow for scalable expansion of the network 
            and provide for reasonable network configuration with regard 
            to peering, inter-administrative domain connectivity,  and other 
            inter-administrative domain interoperability characteristics of 
            interest to wireless ISPs. The LMM framework MUST NOT introduce  
            any additional restrictions in how wireless ISPs configure their 
            network, nor how they interconnect with other networks beyond 
            those introduced by standard IP routing.   In addition, the  
            amount of regional signaling MUST NOT increase as the Local 
            Domain expands in size. 
          
         3.4.6 Resilience to topological changes 
          
            The LMM protocols MUST be topology-independent.  The LMM protocols 
            MUST be able to adapt to topological changes within the domain.  The 
            topological changes may include the addition or removal/failure of 
            LMM agents or that of changes in the routing of the local domain 
            over which the LMM scheme is applied. 
          
          
         3.4.7 Header or Tunneling overhead 
          
            The LMM framework MUST not prevent header compression from being applied.  
            It is recommended that andidate LMM designs that require additional header 
            overhead for tunnel be reviewed by the ROHC working group  to determine if 
            the header compressor can be restarted from transferred compressor context 
            when handover occurs without requiring any full header packet exchange on  
            the new link.

         3.4.8 Optimized signaling within the Local Coverage Area 
           
            By its very nature, LMM reintroduces triangle routing into Mobile IPv6 
            in that all traffic must go through the LMM agent. There is no way 
            to avoid this. The LMM framework SHOULD be designed in such a way  
            as to reduce the length of the unwanted triangle leg.   
                
            The LMM design SHOULD not prohibit optimal placement of LMM agents to 
            reduce or eliminate additional triangle routing introduced by LMM.  
          
            NOTE: It is not required that a LMM scheme specify LMM agents as part 
            of its solution. 
          
         3.5 Mobility Management Support 
          
            The following LMM requirements pertain to both inter-domain and 
            intra-domain hand-off. 
          
         3.5.1 The LMM framework MUST NOT increase the amount of latency or amount of 
               packet loss that exists with the core Mobile IP and Mobile IPv6 
               specification [2, 3].  Indeed, the LMM framework SHOULD decrease the 
               amount of latency or amount of packet loss that exists with the  
               core mobility protocols. 
          
         3.5.2 The LMM framework MUST NOT increase the amount of service disruption 
               that already exists with the core mobility specifications. 
               Again, the LMM framework SHOULD decrease the amount of service 
               disruption that already exists with the core mobility protocols. 
          
          
         3.5.3 The LMM framework MUST NOT increase the number of messages between 
               the mobile host and the respective Correspondent Node(s) and Home  
               Agent as is in the core mobility specifications [2, 3].  The LMM 
               framework SHOULD decrease the number of messages between the 
               mobile host and the respective Correspondent Node(s) and Home 
               Agent as is in the core mobility specifications [2, 3]. 
          
         3.6 Auto-configuration capabilities for LMM constituents  
          
            It is desirable that in order to allow for simple incremental 
            deployment of an LMM scheme, the local mobility agents MUST 
            require minimal (if any) manual configuration.  This plug-and-play 
            feature could make use of IPv6 auto-configuration mechanisms in 
            the case of Mobile IPv6 [3], even  though most likely other  
            automatic configurations will be needed (such as, for example,  
            learning about adjacent LMM agents).  Auto-configuration also  
            facilitates the network to dynamically adapt to general topological  
            changes (whether planned or due to link or node failures).

         3.7 LMM inter-working with IP routing infrastructure requirement 
          
            The LMM framework MUST NOT disrupt core IP routing outside 
            the local domain. 
          
          
         3.8 Sparse routing element population requirement 
          
            Any LMM protocol MUST be designed to be geared towards 
            incremental deployment capabilities; the latter implies 
            that the LMM scheme itself imposes minimum requirements 
            on the carrierÆs network.  Incremental deployment capabilities 
            for an LMM protocol signifies that an initial set of sparse 
            LMM agents can populate the administration domain of a network 
            provider and operate sufficiently.  In addition, any LMM 
            scheme MUST be compatible with any additional deployment 
            of LMM agents in future infrastructure expansions; that is to 
            say, allow progressive LMM deployment capabilities. 
          
            It is for this reason that the LMM framework MUST NOT require 
            that all routing elements be assumed to be LMM-aware in the 
            signaling interactions of an LMM protocol. The LMM framework  
            MUST BE supported, at the very minimum, by a sparse (proper  
            subset) LMM agent population that is co-located within the  
            routing topology of a single administration domain. 
          
          
         3.9 Support for Mobile IPv4 or Mobile IPv6 Handover 
          
            Since one of the primary goals of LMM is to minimize 
            signaling during handover, an LMM solution MUST be 
            available for the standardized Mobile IPv4 or Mobile IPv6  
            handover algorithms.  LMM and the Mobile IP or Mobile IPv6 
            handover algorithms MUST maintain compatibility in their  
            signaling interactions for fulfilling complementary roles  
            with respect to each other. 
          
            This requirement SHOULD NOT be interpreted as ruling out 
            useful optimizations of LMM and Mobile IP or Mobile IPv6 handoff  
            schemes that simplify the implementation or deployment of LMM or  
            Mobile IP or Mobile IPv6 handoff. 
             
                
         3.10 Simple Network design requirement 
          
            LMM SHOULD simplify the network design and provisioning for enabling LMM  
            capability in a network and allow progressive LMM deployment capabilities.

         3.11 Stability 
          
            LMM MUST avoid any forwarding loops. 
          
         3.12 Quality of Service requirements 
          
         3.12.1 The LMM MUST have the ability to coexist with   
                QoS schemes to hide the mobility of the MN to its peer  
                by avoiding end-to-end QoS signaling. 
          
         3.12.2 The LMM MUST have the ability to coexist with QoS  
                schemes to facilitate the new provisioning of both uplink  
                and downlink QoS after a handoff.

           This document does not generate any additional security considerations.

         Appendix A - LMM requirements and HMIPv6 
          
         HMIPv6 was evaluated as a localized mobility management protocol, and that it 
         was mostly found to satisfy the requirements put forth in this document. This 
         section details one exception with some explanation.  
          
         Exception 1: 
          
         One LMM requirement that needs further clarification with respect to HMIPv6 is 
         the requirement that states that LMM should not introduce additional single 
         points of failure.  The HMIPv6 Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) is a new single 
         point of failure.  Proposals for HMIPv6 MAP replication can be optionally 
         incorporated in order to avoid this new single point of failure.  Such proposals 
         can also be applied to the base Mobile IPv6 specification to also allow for Home 
         Agent failover as well.
