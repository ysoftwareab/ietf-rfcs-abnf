Abstract

   This document specifies a means for IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel endpoints to
   support dynamic maximum transmission unit (MTU) determination. It
   provides a means for the local end to recognize when a packet should
   be forwarded to the far end, and when it should be dropped.

Internet-Draft                 Tunnel MTU                  November 2003


1. Introduction

   IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel interfaces (referred to hereafter as "tunnel
   interfaces" or simply "tunnels") use an IPv4 [RFC0791] internetwork
   as the link layer for IPv6 [RFC2461]. The local and remote tunnel
   endpoints are IPv6 neighbors, but packets inside the tunnel may
   traverse multiple IPv4 forwarding hops. Packets that are too large to
   traverse the tunnel are discarded with an ICMPv6 "packet too big"
   message returned to the source, as for any IPv6 interface [RFC1981].

   IPv4 path MTU discovery [RFC1191] is normally used to determine the
   MTU of an IPv4 path. However, IPv4 path MTU discovery uses ICMPv4
   "fragmentation needed" messages which in some cases do not provide
   enough bytes from the original IPv6 packet header for stateless
   translation to ICMPv6 "packet too big" messages ([RFC1812], section
   4.3.2.3). Additionally, ICMPv4 messages can be spoofed, filtered, or
   not sent at all by some forwarding nodes resulting in black holes
   that are difficult to diagnose [RFC2923].

   When designing an alternate path MTU discovery scheme, it is
   important to note that for IPv6 the representation of a path consists
   of the 3-tuple of the Flow Label and the Source and Destination
   address fields in the IPv6 header [FLOWSPEC]. It is also observed
   that the problem of black hole detection when an IPv4 path changes to
   include a restricting link is difficult if not impossible to solve as
   a network layer problem. Past attempts to do so have included:

   o  the current IPv4 Path MTU discovery scheme. (But, in addition to
      the operational issues described above, IPv4 path MTU discovery is
      inefficient due to extra control messages and slow to converge.)

   o  probing the path with large data messages. (But, probing requires
      queueing packets for an indeterminant time in the sender while
      waiting for the probe to complete.)

   o  sensing fragmentation at the receiver. (But, this requires special
      instrumentation in the receiver - also, forwarding nodes that do
      not support IPv4 fragmentation may occur along some paths and
      middleboxes that drop IPv4 fragments are seen in operational
      deployments.)

   o  maintaining flow state in the tunnel interface. (But, this
      consumes resources and requires probe acknowledgement messages
      from a trusted neighbor.)

   The dominating issue with any approach implemented solely at the
   network layer is that it is not possible for the network layer to
   anticipate the packet transmission strategy of the application. Any

   attempt for the network layer to divine such information without the
   explicit guidance of the application amounts to nothing more than an
   educated guess that is likely to be wrong - a result predicted by the
   End-to-End Principle. Thus, alternate mechanisms to support dynamic
   MTU determination for IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel interfaces are required.

2. Terminology

   The terminology of [RFC2460], [RFC2461], and [RFC3168] applies to
   this document. The following terms used in those documents are also
   defined here for clarity:

   MTU:
      same definition as in [RFC1122], section 1.3.3): "the maximum
      transmission unit, i.e., the size of the largest packet that can
      be transmitted".

   LinkMTU:
      same definition as "link MTU" in [RFC2460][RFC2461], which is also
      the same definition as "LinkMTU" in ([RFC2461], section 6.3.2).

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Static MTU Determination

   Tunnel interfaces that do not participate in the dynamic MTU
   determination scheme MUST set LinkMTU to at least 1280 bytes, i.e.,
   the minimum IPv6 MTU ([RFC2460], section 5). If a larger MTU is used,
   the value chosen SHOULD be:

   1.  no larger than the smallest known IPv4 Effective MTU to Receive
       (EMTU_R) ([RFC1122], section 3.3.2) for all potential receivers

   2.  no larger than the smallest known IPv4 LinkMTU in the network

   3.  small enough to allow room for nested link-layer encapsulations
       (e.g., VPN) that may be inserted by middleboxes.

   Tunnel interfaces that use only static MTU determination send IPv6
   packets that are no larger than LinkMTU with the DF bit NOT set in
   the encapsulating IPv4 header. The IPv6 layer discards packets larger
   than LinkMTU and sends an ICMPv6 "packet too big" message to the
   sender, as for any IPv6 interface. Even so, black holes may still
   occur along some paths since IPv4 fragmentation is not universally
   supported by all forwarding nodes, and the minimum supported packet
   size for IPv4 is only 576 bytes.

4. Dynamic MTU Determination

   Tunnel interfaces that use this scheme implement IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery [RFC2461] except as otherwise noted in this document or in
   documents describing specific tunneling mechanisms, e.g., [RFC3056],
   [MECH], [ISATAP], etc.

4.1 Tunnel Interface MTU

   A tunnel interface that implements the dynamic scheme sets LinkMTU to
   a value between 1280 and 65515 bytes (i.e., the maximum IPv4 packet
   size minus 20 bytes for encapsulation). The value selected may be
   chosen relative to the MTU of the largest IPv4 link covered by the
   tunnel, but robust implementations will normally use the larger
   value.

4.2 Sending Packets

   Packets are sent on the tunnel interface using IPv6-in-IPv4
   encapsulation as specified by the various tunneling mechanisms with
   the following additional specification for MTU handling:

   When the tunnel interface sends a packet, it determines through a
   routing table lookup the IPv4 interface that will send the IPv4
   encapsulated packet. If the packet contains an ECN codepoint
   ([RFC3168], section 5) in the IPv6 header, and the IPv4 interface is
   congested (e.g., if it has a large queue of packets waiting to be
   transmitted) the packet is either marked as CE or it is silently
   dropped.

   Next, if the IPv6 packet is no larger than the IPv4 interface MTU
   value (minus 20 bytes) it is encapsulated in IPv4 with the DF bit set
   in the encapsulating header and sent over IPv4. If the packet is
   larger than the IPv4 interface MTU, the packet is dropped. If the
   packet contained an ECN codepoint, it is dropped silently; else an
   ICMPv6 "packet too big" message is sent back to the source.

   As an exception to the above, if the packet is 1280 bytes or less in
   length and it contains an IPv6 fragment header with Fragment Offset
   and M set to 0 ([RFC2460], sections 4.5 and 5), the tunnel interface
   encapsulates the packet in IPv4 then uses IPv4 fragmentation to split
   the packet into 256 byte-maximum pieces. Each of the resulting
   fragments will add a 20 byte IPv4 fragment header making each
   fragment 276 bytes. Thus, each fragment will fit within the ~200msec
   human perceptible delay budget for the lowest-common denominator link
   that may occur over the tunnel, which is 296 bytes for a 9.6kbps link
   ([RFC3150], section 2.3).

   Note that upper layers may record MTU values (e.g., in the conceptual
   destination cache) that are used when possible to determine packet
   sizes before the packet arrives at the tunnel for processing.

4.3 Processing IPv4 Errors

   ICMPv4 "fragmentation needed" messages MAY be translated into IPv6
   "packet too big" messages and sent to the source of the original
   packet if the ICMPv4 message contains enough header bytes from the
   original IPv6 packet, as this might help the packetization layer
   reach convergence more quickly.

5. IANA Considerations

   This document contains no IANA considerations.

6. Security considerations

   Security issues for sending and receiving packets on tunnel
   interfaces are found in the various tunneling mechanism documents.

   Security issues related to the setting of the ECN codepoint are found
   in [RFC3168].
