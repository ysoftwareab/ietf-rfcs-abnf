                         A YANG Data Model for
        Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN) Service Delivery

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   a Layer 2 provider-provisioned VPN service.  It is up to a management
   system to take this as an input and generate specific configuration
   models to configure the different network elements to deliver the
   service.  How this configuration of network elements is done is out
   of scope for this document.

   The YANG data model defined in this document includes support for
   point-to-point Virtual Private Wire Services (VPWSs) and multipoint
   Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLSs) that use Pseudowires signaled
   using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) and the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) as described in RFCs 4761 and 6624.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture defined in RFC 8342.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model for the Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN)
   service.  This model defines service configuration elements that can
   be used in communication protocols between customers and network
   operators.  Those elements can also be used as input to automated
   control and configuration applications and can generate specific
   configuration models to configure the different network elements to
   deliver the service.  How this configuration of network elements is
   done is out of scope for this document.

   Further discussion of the way that services are modeled in YANG and
   the relationship between &quot;customer service models&quot; like the one
   described in this document and configuration models can be found in
   [RFC8309] and [RFC8199].  Sections 4 and 6 also provide more
   information on how this service model could be used and how it fits
   into the overall modeling architecture.

   The YANG data model defined in this document includes support for
   point-to-point Virtual Private Wire Services (VPWSs) and multipoint
   Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLSs) that use Pseudowires signaled
   using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) and the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) as described in [RFC4761] and [RFC6624].  It also
   conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA)
   [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  server

   o  state data

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

1.1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

2.  Definitions

   This document uses the following terms:

   Service Provider (SP):  The organization (usually a commercial
      undertaking) responsible for operating the network that offers VPN
      services to clients and customers.

   Customer Edge (CE) Device:  Equipment that is dedicated to a
      particular customer and is directly connected to one or more PE
      devices via Attachment Circuits (ACs).  A CE is usually located at
      the customer premises and is usually dedicated to a single VPN,
      although it may support multiple VPNs if each one has separate
      ACs.  The CE devices can be routers, bridges, switches, or hosts.

   Provider Edge (PE) Device:  Equipment managed by the SP that can
      support multiple VPNs for different customers and is directly
      connected to one or more CE devices via ACs.  A PE is usually
      located at an SP Point of Presence (POP) and is managed by the SP.

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS):  A VPLS is a provider service
      that emulates the full functionality of a traditional LAN.  A VPLS
      makes it possible to interconnect several LAN segments over a
      packet switched network (PSN) and makes the remote LAN segments
      behave as one single LAN.

   Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS):  A VPWS is a point-to-point
      circuit (i.e., link) connecting two CE devices.  The link is
      established as a logical Layer 2 circuit through a PSN.  The CE in
      the customer network is connected to a PE in the provider network
      via an AC: the AC is either a physical or logical circuit.  A VPWS

      differs from a VPLS in that the VPLS is point-to-multipoint while
      the VPWS is point-to-point.  In some implementations, a set of
      VPWSs is used to create a multi-site L2VPN network.

   Pseudowire (PW):  A Pseudowire is an emulation of a native service
      over a PSN.  The native service may be ATM, Frame Relay, Ethernet,
      low-rate Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), or Synchronous Optical
      Network / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH), while the PSN
      may be MPLS, IP (either IPv4 or IPv6), or Layer 2 Tunneling
      Protocol version 3 (L2TPv3).

   MAC-VRF:  A Virtual Routing and Forwarding table for Media Access
      Control (MAC) addresses on a PE.  It is sometimes also referred to
      as a Virtual Switching Instance (VSI).

   UNI:  User-to-Network Interface.  The physical demarcation point
      between the customer&#x27;s area of responsibility and the provider&#x27;s
      area of responsibility.

   NNI:  Network-to-Network Interface.  A reference point representing
      the boundary between two networks that are operated as separate
      administrative domains.  The two networks may belong to the same
      provider or to two different providers.

   This document uses the following abbreviations:

   BSS:  Business Support System

   BUM:  Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, or Multicast

   CoS:  Class of Service

   LAG:  Link Aggregation Group

   LLDP:  Link Layer Discovery Protocol

   OAM:  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance

   OSS:  Operations Support System

   PDU:  Protocol Data Unit

   QoS:  Quality of Service

3.  The Layer 2 VPN Service Model

   A Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) service is a collection of sites that are
   authorized to exchange traffic between each other over a shared
   infrastructure of a common technology.  The L2VPN Service Model
   (L2SM) described in this document provides a common understanding of
   how the corresponding L2VPN service is to be deployed over the shared
   infrastructure.

   This document presents the L2SM using the YANG data modeling language
   [RFC7950] as a formal language that is both human readable and
   parsable by software for use with protocols such as the Network
   Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].

   This service model is limited to VPWS-based VPNs and VPLS-based VPNs
   as described in [RFC4761] and [RFC6624] and to Ethernet VPNs (EVPNs)
   as described in [RFC7432].

3.1.  Layer 2 VPN Service Types

   From a technology perspective, a set of basic L2VPN service types
   include:

   o  Point-to-point VPWSs that use LDP-signaled Pseudowires or
      L2TP-signaled Pseudowires [RFC6074].

   o  Multipoint VPLSs that use LDP-signaled Pseudowires or
      L2TP-signaled Pseudowires [RFC6074].

   o  Multipoint VPLSs that use a BGP control plane as described in
      [RFC4761] and [RFC6624].

   o  IP-only LAN Services (IPLSs) that are a functional subset of VPLS
      services [RFC7436].

   o  BGP MPLS-based EVPN services as described in [RFC7432] and
      [RFC7209].

   o  EVPN VPWSs as specified in [RFC8214].

3.2.  Layer 2 VPN Physical Network Topology

   Figure 1 below depicts a typical SP&#x27;s physical network topology.
   Most SPs have deployed an IP, MPLS, or Segment Routing (SR)
   multi-service core infrastructure.  Ingress Layer 2 service frames
   will be mapped to either an Ethernet Pseudowire (e.g., Pseudowire
   Emulation Edge to Edge (PWE3)) or a Virtual Extensible Local Area

   Network (VXLAN) PE-to-PE tunnel.  The details of these tunneling
   mechanisms are left to the provider&#x27;s discretion and are not part of
   the L2SM.

   An L2VPN provides end-to-end Layer 2 connectivity over this
   multi-service core infrastructure between two or more customer
   locations or a collection of sites.  ACs are placed between CE
   devices and PE devices that backhaul Layer 2 service frames from the
   customer over the access network to the provider network or remote
   site.  The demarcation point (i.e., UNI) between the customer and the
   SP can be placed between either (1) customer nodes and the CE device
   or (2) the CE device and the PE device.  The actual bearer connection
   between the CE and the PE will be described in the L2SM.

   The SP may also choose a &quot;seamless MPLS&quot; approach to expand the PWE3
   or VXLAN tunnel between sites.

   The SP may leverage Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) to autodiscover and
   signal the PWE3 or VXLAN tunnel endpoints.

   From the customer&#x27;s perspective, however, all the CE devices are
   connected over a simulated LAN environment as shown in Figure 2.
   Broadcast and multicast packets are sent to all participants in the
   same bridge domain.

4.  Service Data Model Usage

   The L2SM provides an abstracted interface to request, configure, and
   manage the components of an L2VPN service.  The model is used by a
   customer who purchases connectivity and other services from an SP to
   communicate with that SP.

   A typical usage for this model is as an input to an orchestration
   layer that is responsible for translating it into configuration
   commands for the network elements that deliver/enable the service.
   The network elements may be routers, but also servers (like
   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)) that are
   necessary within the network.

   The configuration of network elements may be done using the Command
   Line Interface (CLI) or any other configuration (or &quot;southbound&quot;)
   interface such as NETCONF [RFC6241] in combination with device-
   specific and protocol-specific YANG data models.

   This way of using the service model is illustrated in Figure 3 and is
   described in more detail in [RFC8309] and [RFC8199].  The split of
   the orchestration function between a &quot;service orchestrator&quot; and a
   &quot;network orchestrator&quot; is clarified in [RFC8309].  The usage of this
   service model is not limited to this example: it can be used by any
   component of the management system but not directly by network
   elements.

   The usage and structure of this model should be compared to the
   Layer 3 VPN service model defined in [RFC8299].

         Figure 3: Reference Architecture for the Use of the L2SM

   The Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) [MEF-6] has also developed an
   architecture for network management and operations, but the work of
   the MEF embraces all aspects of lifecycle service orchestration,
   including billing, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), order management,
   and lifecycle management.  The IETF&#x27;s work on service models is
   typically smaller and offers a simple, self-contained service YANG
   module.  See [RFC8309] for more details.

5.  Design of the Data Model

   The L2SM is structured in a way that allows the provider to list
   multiple circuits of various service types for the same customer.  A
   circuit represents an end-to-end connection between two or more
   customer locations.

   The YANG module is divided into two main containers: &quot;vpn-services&quot;
   and &quot;sites&quot;.  The &quot;vpn-svc&quot; container under vpn-services defines
   global parameters for the VPN service for a specific customer.

   A site contains at least one network access (i.e., site network
   accesses providing access to the sites, as defined in Section 5.3.2),
   and there may be multiple network accesses in the case of
   multihoming.  Site-to-network-access attachment is done through a
   bearer with a Layer 2 connection on top.  The bearer refers to
   properties of the attachment that are below Layer 2, while the
   connection refers to Layer 2 protocol-oriented properties.  The
   bearer may be allocated dynamically by the SP, and the customer may
   provide some constraints or parameters to drive the placement.

   Authorization of traffic exchanges is done through what we call a VPN
   policy or VPN topology that defines routing exchange rules between
   sites.

   End-to-end multi-segment connectivity can be realized by using a
   combination of per-site connectivity and per-segment connectivity at
   different segments.

   Figure 4 shows the overall structure of the YANG module:

              Figure 4: Overall Structure of the YANG Module

5.1.  Features and Augmentation

   The model defined in this document implements many features that
   allow implementations to be modular.  As an example, the Layer 2
   protocol parameters (Section 5.3.2.2) proposed to the customer may
   also be enabled through features.  This model also defines some
   features for options that are more advanced, such as support for
   extranet VPNs (Section 5.2.4), site diversity (Section 5.3), and QoS
   (Section 5.10.2).

   In addition, as for any YANG data model, this service model can be
   augmented to implement new behaviors or specific features.  For
   example, this model defines VXLAN [RFC7348] for Ethernet packet
   encapsulation; if VXLAN encapsulation does not fulfill all
   requirements for describing the service, new options can be added
   through augmentation.

5.2.  VPN Service Overview

   The vpn-service list item contains generic information about the VPN
   service.  The vpn-id in the vpn-service list refers to an internal
   reference for this VPN service.  This identifier is purely internal
   to the organization responsible for the VPN service.

   The vpn-service list is composed of the following characteristics:

   Customer information (customer-name):  Used to identify the customer.

   VPN service type (vpn-svc-type):  Used to indicate the VPN service
      type.  The identifier is an identity allowing any encoding for the
      local administration of the VPN service.  Note that another
      identity can be an extension of the base identity.

   Cloud access (cloud-access):  All sites in the L2VPN SHOULD be
      permitted to access the cloud by default.  The &quot;cloud-access&quot;
      container provides parameters for authorization rules.  A cloud
      identifier is used to reference the target service.  This
      identifier is local to each administration.

   Service topology (svc-topo):  Used to identify the type of VPN
      service topology that is required.

   Frame delivery service (frame-delivery):  Defines the frame delivery
      support required for the L2VPN, e.g., multicast delivery, unicast
      delivery, or broadcast delivery.

   Extranet VPN (extranet-vpns):  Indicates that a particular VPN needs
      access to resources located in another VPN.

5.2.1.  VPN Service Type

   The &quot;vpn-svc-type&quot; parameter defines the service type for provider-
   provisioned L2VPNs.  The current version of the model supports six
   flavors:

   o  Point-to-point VPWSs connecting two customer sites.

   o  Point-to-point or point-to-multipoint VPWSs connecting a set of
      customer sites [RFC8214].

   o  Multipoint VPLSs connecting a set of customer sites.

   o  Multipoint VPLSs connecting one or more root sites and a set of
      leaf sites but preventing inter-leaf-site communication.

   o  EVPN services [RFC7432] connecting a set of customer sites.

   o  EVPN VPWSs between two customer sites or a set of customer sites
      as specified in [RFC8214].

   Other L2VPN service types could be included by augmentation.  Note
   that an Ethernet Private Line (EPL) service or an Ethernet Virtual
   Private Line (EVPL) service is an Ethernet Line (E-Line) service
   [MEF-6]or a point-to-point Ethernet Virtual Circuit (EVC) service,
   while an Ethernet Private LAN (EP-LAN) service or an Ethernet Virtual
   Private LAN (EVP-LAN) service is an Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service
   [MEF-6] or a multipoint-to-multipoint EVC service.

5.2.2.  VPN Service Topologies

   The types of VPN service topologies discussed below can be used for
   configuration if needed.  The module described in this document
   currently supports any-to-any, Hub-and-Spoke (where Hubs can exchange
   traffic), and Hub-and-Spoke Disjoint (where Hubs cannot exchange
   traffic).  New topologies could be added by augmentation.  By
   default, the any-to-any VPN service topology is used.

5.2.2.1.  Route Target Allocation

   A Layer 2 PE-based VPN (such as a VPLS-based VPN or an EVPN that uses
   BGP as its signaling protocol) can be built using Route Targets (RTs)
   as described in [RFC4364] and [RFC7432].  The management system is
   expected to automatically allocate a set of RTs upon receiving a VPN
   service creation request.  How the management system allocates RTs is
   out of scope for this document, but multiple ways could be envisaged,
   as described in Section 6.2.1.1 of [RFC8299].

5.2.2.2.  Any-to-Any

     +--------------------------------------------------------------+
     |  VPN1_Site 1 ------ PE1               PE2 ------ VPN1_Site 2 |
     |                                                              |
     |  VPN1_Site 3 ------ PE3               PE4 ------ VPN1_Site 4 |
     +--------------------------------------------------------------+

                 Figure 5: Any-to-Any VPN Service Topology

   In the any-to-any VPN service topology, all VPN sites can communicate
   with each other without any restrictions.  The management system that
   receives an any-to-any L2VPN service request through this model is
   expected to assign and then configure the MAC-VRF and RTs on the
   appropriate PEs.  In the any-to-any case, a single RT is generally
   required, and every MAC-VRF imports and exports this RT.

5.2.2.3.  Hub-and-Spoke

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     |   Hub_Site 1 ------ PE1               PE2 ------ Spoke_Site 1 |
     |                          +------------------------------------+
     |                          |
     |                          +------------------------------------+
     |   Hub_Site 2 ------ PE3               PE4 ------ Spoke_Site 2 |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

               Figure 6: Hub-and-Spoke VPN Service Topology

   In the Hub-and-Spoke VPN service topology,

   o  all Spoke sites can communicate only with Hub sites (i.e., Spoke
      sites cannot communicate with each other).

   o  Hubs can communicate with each other.

   The management system that receives a Hub-and-Spoke L2VPN service
   request through this model is expected to assign and then configure
   the MAC-VRF and RTs on the appropriate PEs.  In the Hub-and-Spoke
   case, two RTs are generally required (one RT for Hub routes and one
   RT for Spoke routes).  A Hub MAC-VRF that connects Hub sites will
   export Hub routes with the Hub RT and will import Spoke routes
   through the Spoke RT.  It will also import the Hub RT to allow
   Hub-to-Hub communication.  A Spoke MAC-VRF that connects Spoke sites
   will export Spoke routes with the Spoke RT and will import Hub routes
   through the Hub RT.

5.2.2.4.  Hub-and-Spoke Disjoint

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     |   Hub_Site 1 ------ PE1               PE2 ------ Spoke_Site 1 |
     +--------------------------+  +---------------------------------+
                                |  |
     +--------------------------+  +---------------------------------+
     |   Hub_Site 2 ------ PE3               PE4 ------ Spoke_Site 2 |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

           Figure 7: Hub-and-Spoke-Disjoint VPN Service Topology

   In the Hub-and-Spoke-Disjoint VPN service topology,

   o  all Spoke sites can communicate only with Hub sites (i.e., Spoke
      sites cannot communicate with each other).

   o  Hubs cannot communicate with each other.

   The management system that receives a Hub-and-Spoke-Disjoint L2VPN
   service request through this model is expected to assign and then
   configure the VRF and RTs on the appropriate PEs.  In the
   Hub-and-Spoke-Disjoint case, at least two RTs are required for Hubs
   and Spokes, respectively (at least one RT for Hub routes and at least
   one RT for Spoke routes).  A Hub VRF that connects Hub sites will
   export Hub routes with the Hub RT and will import Spoke routes
   through the Spoke RT.  A Spoke VRF that connects Spoke sites will
   export Spoke routes with the Spoke RT and will import Hub routes
   through the Hub RT.

   The management system MUST take into account constraints on
   Hub-and-Spoke connections, as in the previous case.

   Hub-and-Spoke Disjoint can also be seen as multiple Hub-and-Spoke
   VPNs (one per Hub) that share a common set of Spoke sites.

5.2.3.  Cloud Access

   This model provides cloud access configuration through the
   cloud-access container.  The usage of cloud-access is targeted for
   public cloud access and Internet access.  The cloud-access container
   provides parameters for authorization rules.  Note that this model
   considers that public cloud and public Internet access share some
   commonality; therefore, it does not distinguish Internet access from
   cloud access.  If needed, a different label for Internet access could
   be added by augmentation.

   Private cloud access may be addressed through the site container as
   described in Section 5.3, with usage consistent with sites of
   type &quot;NNI&quot;.

   A cloud identifier is used to reference the target service.  This
   identifier is local to each administration.

   By default, all sites in the L2VPN SHOULD be permitted to access the
   cloud or the Internet.  If restrictions are required, a user MAY
   configure some limitations for some sites or nodes by using policies,
   i.e., the &quot;permit-site&quot; or &quot;deny-site&quot; leaf-list.  The permit-site
   leaf-list defines the list of sites authorized for cloud access.  The
   deny-site leaf-list defines the list of sites denied for cloud
   access.  The model supports both &quot;deny-any-except&quot; and
   &quot;permit-any-except&quot; authorization.

   How the restrictions will be configured on network elements is out of
   scope for this document.

                        L2VPN

                      + Cloud 2 +
                      +++++++++++

              Figure 8: Example of Cloud Access Configuration

   As shown in Figure 8, we configure the global VPN to access the
   Internet by creating a cloud-access container pointing to the cloud
   identifier for the Internet service.  (This is illustrated in the XML
   [W3C.REC-xml-20081126] below.)  No authorized sites will be
   configured, as all sites are required to be able to access the
   Internet.

    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
       &lt;l2vpn-svc xmlns=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l2vpn-svc&quot;&gt;
       &lt;vpn-services&gt;
       &lt;vpn-service&gt;
       &lt;vpn-id&gt;123456487&lt;/vpn-id&gt;
      &lt;cloud-accesses&gt;
       &lt;cloud-access&gt;
          &lt;cloud-identifier&gt;INTERNET&lt;/cloud-identifier&gt;
       &lt;/cloud-access&gt;
      &lt;/cloud-accesses&gt;
      &lt;ce-vlan-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-preservation&gt;
      &lt;ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;
      &lt;/vpn-service&gt;
      &lt;/vpn-services&gt;
    &lt;/l2vpn-svc&gt;

   If Site 1 and Site 2 require access to Cloud 1, a new cloud-access
   container pointing to the cloud identifier of Cloud 1 will be
   created.  The permit-site leaf-list will be filled with a reference
   to Site 1 and Site 2.

    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
       &lt;l2vpn-svc xmlns=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l2vpn-svc&quot;&gt;
        &lt;vpn-services&gt;
         &lt;vpn-service&gt;
         &lt;vpn-id&gt;123456487&lt;/vpn-id&gt;
         &lt;cloud-accesses&gt;
          &lt;cloud-access&gt;
            &lt;cloud-identifier&gt;Cloud1&lt;/cloud-identifier&gt;
            &lt;permit-site&gt;site1&lt;/permit-site&gt;
            &lt;permit-site&gt;site2&lt;/permit-site&gt;
          &lt;/cloud-access&gt;
         &lt;/cloud-accesses&gt;
        &lt;ce-vlan-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-preservation&gt;
        &lt;ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;
       &lt;/vpn-service&gt;
       &lt;/vpn-services&gt;
    &lt;/l2vpn-svc&gt;

   If all sites except Site 1 require access to Cloud 2, a new
   cloud-access container pointing to the cloud identifier of Cloud 2
   will be created.  The deny-site leaf-list will be filled with a
   reference to Site 1.

    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
      &lt;l2vpn-svc xmlns=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l2vpn-svc&quot;&gt;
        &lt;vpn-services&gt;
         &lt;vpn-service&gt;
           &lt;vpn-id&gt;123456487&lt;/vpn-id&gt;
            &lt;cloud-accesses&gt;
             &lt;cloud-access&gt;
              &lt;cloud-identifier&gt;Cloud2&lt;/cloud-identifier&gt;
              &lt;deny-site&gt;site1&lt;/deny-site&gt;
            &lt;/cloud-access&gt;
           &lt;/cloud-accesses&gt;
          &lt;ce-vlan-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-preservation&gt;
          &lt;ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;
        &lt;/vpn-service&gt;
      &lt;/vpn-services&gt;
    &lt;/l2vpn-svc&gt;

5.2.4.  Extranet VPNs

   There are some cases where a particular VPN needs access to resources
   (servers, hosts, etc.) that are external.  Those resources may be
   located in another VPN.

                 +-----------+           +-----------+
                /             \         /             \
     Site A -- |    VPN A      |  ---  |    VPN B      | --- Site B
                \             /         \             /      (Shared
                 +-----------+           +-----------+        resources)

                 Figure 9: Example of Shared VPN Resources

   As illustrated in Figure 9, VPN B has some resources on Site B that
   need to be made available to some customers/partners.  Specifically,
   VPN A must be able to access those VPN B resources.

   Such a VPN connection scenario can be achieved via a VPN policy as
   defined in Section 5.5.2.2.  But there are some simple cases where a
   particular VPN (VPN A) needs access to all resources in another VPN
   (VPN B).  The model provides an easy way to set up this connection
   using the &quot;extranet-vpns&quot; container.

   The extranet-vpns container defines a list of VPNs a particular VPN
   wants to access.  The extranet-vpns container is used on customer
   VPNs accessing extranet resources in another VPN.  In Figure 9, in
   order to provide VPN A with access to VPN B, the extranet-vpns
   container needs to be configured under VPN A with an entry
   corresponding to VPN B.  There is no service configuration
   requirement on VPN B.

   Readers should note that even if there is no configuration
   requirement on VPN B, if VPN A lists VPN B as an extranet, all sites
   in VPN B will gain access to all sites in VPN A.

   The &quot;site-role&quot; leaf defines the role of the local VPN sites in the
   target extranet VPN service topology.  Site roles are defined in
   Section 5.4.

   In the example below, VPN A accesses VPN B resources through an
   extranet connection.  A Spoke role is required for VPN A sites, as
   sites from VPN A must not be able to communicate with each other
   through the extranet VPN connection.

     &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
       &lt;l2vpn-svc xmlns=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l2vpn-svc&quot;&gt;
        &lt;vpn-services&gt;
          &lt;vpn-service&gt;
            &lt;vpn-id&gt;VPNB&lt;/vpn-id&gt;
              &lt;svc-topo&gt;hub-spoke&lt;/svc-topo&gt;
             &lt;ce-vlan-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-preservation&gt;
             &lt;ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;
          &lt;/vpn-service&gt;
          &lt;vpn-service&gt;
             &lt;vpn-id&gt;VPNA&lt;/vpn-id&gt;
               &lt;svc-topo&gt;any-to-any&lt;/svc-topo&gt;
                  &lt;extranet-vpns&gt;
                    &lt;extranet-vpn&gt;
                     &lt;vpn-id&gt;VPNB&lt;/vpn-id&gt;
                     &lt;local-sites-role&gt;spoke-role&lt;/local-sites-role&gt;
                   &lt;/extranet-vpn&gt;
                 &lt;/extranet-vpns&gt;
             &lt;ce-vlan-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-preservation&gt;
             &lt;ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;
         &lt;/vpn-service&gt;
       &lt;/vpn-services&gt;
      &lt;/l2vpn-svc&gt;

   This model does not define how the extranet configuration will be
   achieved within the network.

   Any VPN interconnection scenario that is more complex (e.g., only
   certain parts of sites on VPN A accessing only certain parts of sites
   on VPN B) needs to be achieved using a VPN attachment as defined in
   Section 5.5.2 and, in particular, a VPN policy as defined in
   Section 5.5.2.2.

5.2.5.  Frame Delivery Service

   If a BUM (Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, or Multicast) frame delivery
   service is supported for an L2VPN, some global frame delivery
   parameters are required as input for the service request.  When a CE
   sends BUM packets, replication occurs at the ingress PE and three
   frame types need to be supported.

   Users of this model will need to provide the flavors of trees that
   will be used by customers within the L2VPN (customer-tree-flavors).
   The model defined in this document supports bidirectional, shared,
   and source-based trees (and can be augmented to contain other tree
   types).  Multiple flavors of trees can be supported simultaneously.

   Multicast-group-to-port mappings can be created using the
   &quot;rp-group-mappings&quot; leaf.  Two group-to-port mapping methods are
   supported:

   o  Static configuration of multicast Ethernet addresses and
      ports/interfaces.

   o  A multicast control protocol based on Layer 2 technology that
      signals mappings of multicast addresses to ports/interfaces, such
      as the Generic Attribute Registration Protocol (GARP) / GARP
      Multicast Registration Protocol (GARP/GMRP) [IEEE-802-1D].

5.3.  Site Overview

   A site represents a connection of a customer office to one or more
   VPN services.  Each site is associated with one or more locations.

         Figure 11: Example: Customer Office and Two VPN Services

   The provider uses the site container to store information regarding
   detailed implementation arrangements made with either the customer or
   peer operators at each interconnect location.

   We restrict the L2SM to exterior interfaces (i.e., UNIs and NNIs)
   only, so all internal interfaces and the underlying topology are
   outside the scope of the L2SM.

   Typically, the following characteristics of a site interface handoff
   need to be documented as part of the service design:

   Unique identifier (site-id):  An arbitrary string to uniquely
      identify the site within the overall network infrastructure.  The
      format of &quot;site-id&quot; is determined by the local administrator of
      the VPN service.

   Device (device):  The customer can request one or more customer
      premises equipment entities from the SP for a particular site.

   Management (management):  Defines the model of management for the
      site -- for example, type, management-transport, address.  This
      parameter determines the boundary between the SP and the customer,
      i.e., who has ownership of the CE device.

   Location (location):  The site location information.  Allows easy
      retrieval of data about the nearest available resources.

   Site diversity (site-diversity):  Presents some parameters to support
      site diversity.

   Site network accesses (site-network-accesses):  Defines the list of
      ports to the site and their properties -- in particular, bearer,
      connection, and service parameters.

   A site-network-access represents an Ethernet logical connection to a
   site.  A site may have multiple site-network-accesses.

        +------------------+             Site
        |                  |-------------------------------------
        |                  |****** (site-network-access#1) ******

        |                  |****** (site-network-access#2) ******

        +------------------+

              Figure 12: Two Site-Network-Accesses for a Site

   Multiple site-network-accesses are used, for instance, in the case of
   multihoming.  Some other meshing cases may also include multiple
   site-network-accesses.

   The site configuration is viewed as a global entity; we assume that
   it is mostly the management system&#x27;s role to split the parameters
   between the different elements within the network.  For example, in
   the case of the site-network-access configuration, the management
   system needs to split the parameters between the PE configuration and
   the CE configuration.

   The site may support single-homed access or multihoming.  In the case
   of multihoming, the site can support multiple site-network-accesses.
   Under each site-network-access, &quot;vpn-attachment&quot; is defined;
   vpn-attachment will describe the association between a given
   site-network-access and a given site, as well as the VPN to which
   that site will connect.

5.3.1.  Devices and Locations

   The information in the &quot;location&quot; sub-container under a site
   container and in the &quot;devices&quot; container allows easy retrieval of
   data about the nearest available facilities and can be used for
   access topology planning.  It may also be used by other network
   orchestration components to choose the targeted upstream PE and
   downstream CE.  Location is expressed in terms of postal information.
   More detailed information or other location information can be added
   by augmentation.

   A site may be composed of multiple locations.  All the locations will
   need to be configured as part of the &quot;locations&quot; container and list.

   A typical example of a multi-location site is a headquarters office
   in a city, where the office is composed of multiple buildings.  Those
   buildings may be located in different parts of the city and may be
   linked by intra-city fibers (a customer metropolitan area network).
   This model does not represent connectivity between multiple locations
   of a site, because that connectivity is controlled by the customer.
   In such a case, when connecting to a VPN service, the customer may
   ask for multihoming based on its distributed locations.

            New York Site
        +------------------+             Site
        | +--------------+ |-------------------------------------
        | | Manhattan    | |****** (site-network-access#1) ******
        | +--------------+ |
        | +--------------+ |
        | | Brooklyn     | |****** (site-network-access#2) ******
        | +--------------+ |-------------------------------------
        +------------------+

              Figure 13: Two Site-Network-Accesses, Two Sites

   A customer may also request the use of some premises equipment
   entities (CEs) from the SP via the devices container.  Requesting a
   CE implies a provider-managed or co-managed model.  A particular
   device must be requested for a particular already-configured
   location.  This would help the SP send the device to the appropriate
   postal address.  In a multi-location site, a customer may, for
   example, request a CE for each location on the site where multihoming
   must be implemented.  In Figure 13, one device may be requested for
   the Manhattan location and one other for the Brooklyn location.

   By using devices and locations, the user can influence the
   multihoming scenario they want to implement: single CE, dual CE, etc.

5.3.2.  Site Network Accesses

   The L2SM includes a set of essential physical interface properties
   and Ethernet-layer characteristics in the &quot;site-network-accesses&quot;
   container.  Some of these are critical implementation arrangements
   that require consent from both the customer and the provider.

   As mentioned earlier, a site may be multihomed.  Each logical network
   access for a site is defined in the site-network-accesses container.
   The site-network-access parameter defines how the site is connected
   on the network and is split into three main classes of parameters:

   o  bearer: defines requirements of the attachment (below Layer 2).

   o  connection: defines Layer 2 protocol parameters of the attachment.

   o  availability: defines the site&#x27;s availability policy.  The
      availability parameters are defined in Section 5.8.

   The site-network-access has a specific type
   (site-network-access type).  This document defines two types:

   o  point-to-point: describes a point-to-point connection between the
      SP and the customer.

   o  multipoint: describes a multipoint connection between the SP and
      the customer.

   This site-network-access type may have an impact on the parameters
   offered to the customer, e.g., an SP might not offer MAC loop
   protection for multipoint accesses.  It is up to the provider to
   decide what parameters are supported for point-to-point and/or
   multipoint accesses.  Multipoint accesses are out of scope for this
   document; some containers defined in the model may require extensions
   in order to work properly for multipoint accesses.

5.3.2.1.  Bearer

   The &quot;bearer&quot; container defines the requirements for the site
   attachment (below Layer 2) to the provider network.

   The bearer parameters will help to determine the access media to
   be used.

5.3.2.2.  Connection

   The &quot;connection&quot; container defines the Layer 2 protocol parameters of
   the attachment (e.g., vlan-id or circuit-id) and provides
   connectivity between customer Ethernet switches.  Depending on the
   management mode, it refers to PE-CE-LAN segment addressing or to
   CE-to-customer-LAN segment addressing.  In any case, it describes the
   responsibility boundary between the provider and the customer.  For a
   customer-managed site, it refers to the PE-CE-LAN segment connection.
   For a provider-managed site, it refers to the CE-to-customer-LAN
   segment connection.

   The &quot;encapsulation-type&quot; parameter allows the user to select between
   Ethernet encapsulation (port-based) or Ethernet VLAN encapsulation
   (VLAN-based).  All of the allowed Ethernet interface types of service
   frames can be listed under &quot;ether-inf-type&quot;, e.g., untagged
   interface, tagged interface, LAG interface.

   Corresponding to &quot;ether-inf-type&quot;, the connection container also
   presents three sets of link attributes: untagged interface, tagged
   interface, and optional LAG interface attributes.  These parameters
   are essential for the connection to be properly established between
   the CE devices and the PE devices.  The connection container also
   defines a Layer 2 Control Protocol (L2CP) attribute that allows
   control-plane protocol interaction between the CE devices and the PE
   device.

5.3.2.2.1.  Untagged Interface

   For each untagged interface (untagged-interface), there are basic
   configuration parameters like interface index and speed, interface
   MTU, auto-negotiation and flow-control settings, etc.  In addition,
   and based on mutual agreement, the customer and provider may decide
   to enable advanced features, such as LLDP, IEEE 802.3ah
   [IEEE-802-3ah], or MAC loop detection/prevention at a UNI.  If loop
   avoidance is required, the attribute &quot;uni-loop-prevention&quot; must be
   set to &quot;true&quot;.

5.3.2.2.2.  Tagged Interface

   If the tagged service is enabled on a logical unit on the connection
   at the interface, &quot;encapsulation-type&quot; should be specified as the
   Ethernet VLAN encapsulation (if VLAN-based) or VXLAN encapsulation,
   and &quot;eth-inf-type&quot; should be set to indicate a tagged interface.

   In addition, &quot;tagged-interface-type&quot; should be specified in the
   &quot;tagged-interface&quot; container to determine how tagging needs to be
   done.  The current model defines five ways to perform VLAN tagging:

   o  priority-tagged: SPs encapsulate and tag packets between the CE
      and the PE with the frame priority level.

   o  dot1q-vlan-tagged: SPs encapsulate packets between the CE and the
      PE with one or a set of customer VLAN (CVLAN) IDs.

   o  qinq: SPs encapsulate packets that enter their networks with
      multiple CVLAN IDs and a single VLAN tag with a single SP VLAN
      (SVLAN).

   o  qinany: SPs encapsulate packets that enter their networks with
      unknown CVLANs and a single VLAN tag with a single SVLAN.

   o  vxlan: SPs encapsulate packets that enter their networks with a
      VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) and a peer list.

   The overall S-tag for the Ethernet circuit and (if applicable)
   C-tag-to-SVC mapping (where &quot;SVC&quot; stands for &quot;Switched Virtual
   Circuit&quot;) have been placed in the &quot;service&quot; container.  For the qinq
   and qinany options, the S-tag under &quot;qinq&quot; and &quot;qinany&quot; should match
   the S-tag in the service container in most cases; however, VLAN
   translation is required for the S-tag in certain deployments at the
   external-facing interface or upstream PEs to &quot;normalize&quot; the outer
   VLAN tag to the service S-tag into the network and translate back to
   the site&#x27;s S-tag in the opposite direction.  One example of this is
   with a Layer 2 aggregation switch along the path: the S-tag for the
   SVC has been previously assigned to another service and thus cannot
   be used by this AC.

5.3.2.2.3.  LAG Interface

   Sometimes, the customer may require multiple physical links bundled
   together to form a single, logical, point-to-point LAG connection to
   the SP.  Typically, the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is
   used to dynamically manage adding or deleting member links of the
   aggregate group.  In general, a LAG allows for increased service
   bandwidth beyond the speed of a single physical link while providing
   graceful degradation as failure occurs, thus increasing availability.

   In the L2SM, there is a set of attributes under &quot;lag-interface&quot;
   related to link aggregation functionality.  The customer and provider
   first need to decide on whether LACP PDUs will be exchanged between
   the edge devices by specifying the &quot;LACP-state&quot; as &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;.  If
   LACP is to be enabled, then both parties need to further specify
   (1) whether LACP will be running in active or passive mode and
   (2) the time interval and priority level of the LACP PDU.  The
   customer and provider can also determine the minimum aggregate
   bandwidth for a LAG to be considered as a valid path by specifying
   the optional &quot;mini-link-num&quot; attribute.  To enable fast detection of
   faulty links, micro-BFD [RFC7130] (&quot;BFD&quot; stands for &quot;Bidirectional
   Forwarding Detection&quot;) runs independent UDP sessions to monitor the
   status of each member link.  The customer and provider should agree
   on the BFD hello interval and hold time.

   Each member link will be listed under the LAG interface with basic
   physical link properties.  Certain attributes, such as flow control,
   encapsulation type, allowed ingress Ethertype, and LLDP settings, are
   at the LAG level.

5.3.2.2.4.  CVLAN-ID-to-SVC Mapping

   When more than one service is multiplexed onto the same interface,
   ingress service frames are conditionally transmitted through one of
   the L2VPN services based upon a pre-arranged customer-VLAN-to-SVC
   mapping.  Multiple CVLANs can be bundled across the same SVC.  The
   bundling type will determine how a group of CVLANs is bundled into
   one VPN service (i.e., VLAN-bundling).

   When applicable, &quot;cvlan-id-to-svc-map&quot; contains the list of CVLANs
   that are mapped to the same service.  In most cases, this will be the
   VLAN access-list for the inner 802.1Q tag [IEEE-802-1Q] (the C-tag).

   A VPN service can be set to preserve the CE-VLAN ID and CE-VLAN CoS
   from the source site to the destination site.  This is required when
   the customer wants to use the VLAN header information between its two
   sites.  CE-VLAN ID preservation and CE-VLAN CoS preservation are
   applied on each site-network-access within sites.  &quot;Preservation&quot;
   means that the value of the CE-VLAN ID and/or CE-VLAN CoS at the
   source site must be equal to the value at a destination site
   belonging to the same L2VPN service.

   If all-to-one bundling is enabled (i.e., the bundling type is set to
   &quot;all-to-one bundling&quot;), then preservation applies to all ingress
   service frames.  If all-to-one bundling is disabled, then
   preservation applies to tagged ingress service frames having the
   CE-VLAN ID.

5.3.2.2.5.  L2CP Control Support

   The customer and the SP should arrange in advance whether or not to
   allow control-plane protocol interaction between the CE devices and
   the PE device.  To provide seamless operation with multicast data
   transport, the transparent operation of Ethernet control protocols
   (e.g., the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) [IEEE-802-1D]) can be
   employed by customers.

   To support efficient dynamic transport, Ethernet multicast control
   frames (e.g., GARP/GMRP [IEEE-802-1D]) can be used between the CE and
   the PE.  However, solutions MUST NOT assume that all CEs are always
   running such protocols (typically in the case where a CE is a router
   and is not aware of Layer 2 details).

   The destination MAC addresses of these L2CP PDUs fall within two
   reserved blocks specified by the IEEE 802.1 Working Group.  Packets
   with destination MAC addresses in these multicast ranges have special
   forwarding rules.

   o  Bridge block of protocols: 01-80-C2-00-00-00 through
      01-80-C2-00-00-0F

   o  MRP block of protocols: 01-80-C2-00-00-20 through
      01-80-C2-00-00-2F

   Layer 2 protocol tunneling allows SPs to pass subscriber Layer 2
   control PDUs across the network without being interpreted and
   processed by intermediate network devices.  These L2CP PDUs are
   transparently encapsulated across the MPLS-enabled core network in
   QinQ fashion.

   The &quot;L2CP-control&quot; container contains the list of commonly used L2CP
   protocols and parameters.  The SP can specify discard-mode,
   peer-mode, or tunnel-mode actions for each individual protocol.

5.3.2.2.6.  Ethernet Service OAM

   The advent of Ethernet as a wide-area network technology brings the
   additional requirements of end-to-end service monitoring and fault
   management in the SP network, particularly in the area of service
   availability and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).  Ethernet Service OAM in
   the L2SM refers to the combined protocol suites of IEEE 802.1ag
   [IEEE-802-1ag] and ITU-T Y.1731 [ITU-T-Y-1731].

   Generally speaking, Ethernet Service OAM enables SPs to perform
   service continuity checks, fault isolation, and packet delay/jitter
   measurement at per-customer and per-site-network-access granularity.
   The information collected from Ethernet Service OAM data sets is
   complementary to other higher-layer IP/MPLS OSS tools to ensure that
   the required SLAs can be met.

   The 802.1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) functional model is
   structured with hierarchical Maintenance Domains (MDs), each assigned
   with a unique maintenance level.  Higher-level MDs can be nested over
   lower-level MDs.  However, the MDs cannot intersect.  The scope of
   each MD can be solely within a customer network or solely within the
   SP network.  An MD can interact between CEs and PEs (customer-to-
   provider) or between PEs (provider-to-provider), or it can tunnel
   over another SP network.

   Depending on the use-case scenario, one or more Maintenance Entity
   Group End Points (MEPs) can be placed on the external-facing
   interface, sending CFM PDUs towards the core network (&quot;Up MEP&quot;) or
   downstream link (&quot;Down MEP&quot;).

   The &quot;cfm-802.1-ag&quot; sub-container under &quot;site-network-access&quot; presents
   the CFM Maintenance Association (MA), i.e., Down MEP for the UNI MA.

   For each MA, the user can define the Maintenance Association
   Identifier (MAID), MEP level, MEP direction, Remote MEP ID, CoS level
   of the CFM PDUs, Continuity Check Message (CCM) interval and hold
   time, alarm-priority defect (i.e., the lowest-priority defect that is
   allowed to generate a fault alarm), CCM priority type, etc.

   ITU-T Y.1731 Performance Monitoring (PM) provides essential network
   telemetry information that includes the measurement of Ethernet
   service frame delay, frame delay variation, frame loss, and frame
   throughput.  The delay/jitter measurement can be either one-way or
   two-way.  Typically, a Y.1731 PM probe sends a small amount of
   synthetic frames along with service frames to measure the SLA
   parameters.

   The &quot;y-1731&quot; sub-container under &quot;site-network-access&quot; contains a set
   of parameters to define the PM probe information, including MAID,
   local and Remote MEP ID, PM PDU type, message period and measurement
   interval, CoS level of the PM PDUs, loss measurement by synthetic or
   service frame options, one-way or two-way delay measurement, PM frame
   size, and session type.

5.4.  Site Roles

   A VPN has a particular service topology, as described in
   Section 5.2.2.  As a consequence, each site belonging to a VPN is
   assigned a particular role in this topology.  The site-role leaf
   defines the role of the site in a particular VPN topology.

   In the any-to-any VPN service topology, all sites MUST have the same
   role, which will be &quot;any-to-any-role&quot;.

   In the Hub-and-Spoke VPN service topology or the Hub-and-Spoke-
   Disjoint VPN service topology, sites MUST have a Hub role or a
   Spoke role.

5.5.  Site Belonging to Multiple VPNs

5.5.1.  Site VPN Flavors

   A site may be part of one or more VPNs.  The &quot;site-vpn-flavor&quot;
   defines the way that the VPN multiplexing is done.  There are four
   possible types of external-facing connections associated with an EVPN
   service and a site.  Therefore, the model supports four flavors:

   o  site-vpn-flavor-single: The site belongs to only one VPN.

   o  site-vpn-flavor-multi: The site belongs to multiple VPNs, and all
      the logical accesses of the sites belong to the same set of VPNs.

   o  site-vpn-flavor-nni: The site represents an NNI where two
      administrative domains belonging to the same or different
      providers interconnect.

   o  site-vpn-flavor-e2e: The site represents an end-to-end
      multi-segment connection.

5.5.1.1.  Single VPN Attachment: site-vpn-flavor-single

   Figure 14 depicts a single VPN attachment.  The site connects to only
   one VPN.

   Figure 15 shows a site connected to multiple VPNs.

                      Figure 15: Multi-VPN Attachment

   In Figure 15, the New York office is multihomed.  Both logical
   accesses are using the same VPN attachment rules, and both are
   connected to VPN A and to VPN B.

   Reaching VPN A or VPN B from the New York office will be done via MAC
   destination-based forwarding.  Having the same destination reachable
   from the two VPNs may cause routing problems.  The customer

   administration&#x27;s role in this case would be to ensure the appropriate
   mapping of its MAC addresses in each VPN.  See Sections 5.5.2 and
   5.10.2 for more details.  See also Section 5.10.3 for details
   regarding support for BUM.

5.5.1.3.  NNI: site-vpn-flavor-nni

   A Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) scenario may be modeled using
   the sites container.  It is helpful for the SP to indicate that the
   requested VPN connection is not a regular site but rather is an NNI,
   as specific default device configuration parameters may be applied in
   the case of NNIs (e.g., Access Control Lists (ACLs), routing
   policies).

                     Figure 16: Option A NNI Scenario

   Figure 16 illustrates an option A NNI scenario that can be modeled
   using the sites container.  In order to connect its customer VPNs
   (VPN1 and VPN2) in SP B, SP A may request the creation of some
   site-network-accesses to SP B.  The site-vpn-flavor-nni type will
   be used to inform SP B that this is an NNI and not a regular
   customer site.

5.5.1.4.  E2E: site-vpn-flavor-e2e

   An end-to-end (E2E) multi-segment VPN connection to be constructed
   out of several connectivity segments may be modeled.  It is helpful
   for the SP to indicate that the requested VPN connection is not a
   regular site but rather is an end-to-end VPN connection, as specific
   default device configuration parameters may be applied in the case of
   site-vpn-flavor-e2e (e.g., QoS configuration).  In order to establish
   a connection between Site 1 in SP A and Site 2 in SP B spanning
   multiple domains, SP A may request the creation of end-to-end
   connectivity to SP B.  The site-vpn-flavor-e2e type will be used to
   indicate that this is an end-to-end connectivity setup and not a
   regular customer site.

5.5.2.  Attaching a Site to a VPN

   Due to the multiple site-vpn flavors, the attachment of a site to an
   L2VPN is done at the site-network-access (logical access) level
   through the &quot;vpn-attachment&quot; container.  The vpn-attachment container
   is mandatory.  The model provides two ways to attach a site to a VPN:

   o  By referencing the target VPN directly.

   o  By referencing a VPN policy for attachments that are more complex.

   These options allow the user to choose the flavor that provides the
   best fit.

5.5.2.1.  Referencing a VPN

   Referencing a vpn-id provides an easy way to attach a particular
   logical access to a VPN.  This is the best way in the case of a
   single VPN attachment.  When referencing a vpn-id, the site-role
   setting must be added to express the role of the site in the target
   VPN service topology.

                         &lt;cir&gt;450000000&lt;/cir&gt;
                         &lt;cbs&gt;20000000&lt;/cbs&gt;
                         &lt;eir&gt;1000000000&lt;/eir&gt;
                         &lt;ebs&gt;200000000&lt;/ebs&gt;
                     &lt;/bandwidth&gt;
                    &lt;/svc-bandwidth&gt;
                     &lt;carrierscarrier&gt;
                       &lt;signaling-type&gt;bgp&lt;/signaling-type&gt;
                     &lt;/carrierscarrier&gt;
                     &lt;svc-mtu&gt;1514&lt;/svc-mtu&gt;
                   &lt;/service&gt;
            &lt;vpn-attachment&gt;
             &lt;vpn-id&gt;VPNB&lt;/vpn-id&gt;
             &lt;site-role&gt;spoke-role&lt;/site-role&gt;
            &lt;/vpn-attachment&gt;
           &lt;/site-network-access&gt;
          &lt;/site-network-accesses&gt;
      &lt;/site&gt;
     &lt;/sites&gt;
    &lt;/l2vpn-svc&gt;

   The example above describes a multi-VPN case where a site (SITE 1)
   has two logical accesses (LA1 and LA2), attached to both VPNA and
   VPNB.

5.5.2.2.  VPN Policy

   The &quot;vpn-policy&quot; list helps express a multi-VPN scenario where a
   logical access belongs to multiple VPNs.

   As a site can belong to multiple VPNs, the vpn-policy list may be
   composed of multiple entries.  A filter can be applied to specify
   that only some LANs at the site should be part of a particular VPN.
   A site can be composed of multiple LAN segments, and each LAN segment
   can be connected to a different VPN.  Each time a site (or LAN) is
   attached to a VPN, the user must precisely describe its role
   (site-role) within the target VPN service topology.

     |       Site 1 ------ PE7                                       |

     |                                                             | |
     |                      [VPN3]                                 | |

                       Figure 17: VPN Policy Example

   In Figure 17, Site 5 is part of two VPNs: VPN3 and VPN2.  It will
   play a Hub role in VPN2 and an any-to-any role in VPN3.  We can
   express such a multi-VPN scenario as follows:

   &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
    &lt;l2vpn-svc xmlns=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l2vpn-svc&quot;&gt;

       &lt;ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;
      &lt;/vpn-service&gt;
      &lt;vpn-service&gt;
       &lt;vpn-id&gt;VPN3&lt;/vpn-id&gt;
       &lt;ce-vlan-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-preservation&gt;
       &lt;ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;
      &lt;/vpn-service&gt;
     &lt;/vpn-services&gt;
     &lt;sites&gt;

             &lt;/vpn&gt;

   Now, if a more granular VPN attachment is necessary, filtering can be
   used.  For example, if LAN1 from Site 5 must be attached to VPN2 as a
   Hub and LAN2 must be attached to VPN3, the following configuration
   can be used:

    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
      &lt;l2vpn-svc xmlns=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l2vpn-svc&quot;&gt;
        &lt;vpn-services&gt;
          &lt;vpn-service&gt;
            &lt;vpn-id&gt;VPN2&lt;/vpn-id&gt;
            &lt;ce-vlan-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-preservation&gt;
            &lt;ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;
            &lt;/vpn-service&gt;
            &lt;vpn-service&gt;
             &lt;vpn-id&gt;VPN3&lt;/vpn-id&gt;
             &lt;ce-vlan-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-preservation&gt;
             &lt;ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;

           &lt;/sites&gt;
         &lt;/l2vpn-svc&gt;

5.6.  Deciding Where to Connect the Site

   The management system will have to determine where to connect each
   site-network-access of a particular site to the provider network
   (e.g., PE or aggregation switch).

   This model defines parameters and constraints that can influence the
   meshing of the site-network-access.

   The management system MUST honor all customer constraints, or, if a
   constraint is too strict and cannot be fulfilled, the management
   system MUST NOT provision the site and MUST provide the user with
   information regarding any constraints that could not be fulfilled.
   How this information is provided is out of scope for this document.
   Whether or not to relax the constraint would then be left up to
   the user.

   Parameters such as site location (see Section 5.6.2) and access type
   (see Section 5.6.3) affect the service placement that the management
   system applies.

   In addition to parameters and constraints, the management system&#x27;s
   decision MAY be based on any other internal constraints that are left
   up to the SP, e.g., least load, distance.

5.6.1.  Constraint: Device

   In the case of provider management or co-management, one or more
   devices have been ordered by the customer to a particular location
   that has already been configured.  The customer may force a
   particular site-network-access to be connected on a particular device
   that it ordered.

             New York Site
        +------------------+             Site
        | +--------------+ |-------------------------------------
        | | Manhattan    | |
        | |           CE1********* (site-network-access#1) ******
        | +--------------+ |
        | +--------------+ |
        | | Brooklyn     | |
        | |           CE2********* (site-network-access#2) ******
        | +--------------+ |
        |                  |-------------------------------------
        +------------------+

          Figure 18: Example of a Constraint Applied to a Device

   In Figure 18, site-network-access#1 is associated with CE1 in the
   service request.  The SP must ensure the provisioning of this
   connection.

5.6.2.  Constraint/Parameter: Site Location

   The location information provided in this model MAY be used by a
   management system to determine the target PE to mesh the site (SP
   side).  A particular location must be associated with each site
   network access when configuring it.  The SP MUST honor the
   termination of the access on the location associated with the site
   network access (customer side).  The &quot;country-code&quot; in the site
   location should be expressed as an ISO 3166 code and is similar to
   the &quot;country&quot; label defined in [RFC4119].

   The site-network-access location is determined by the
   &quot;location-flavor&quot;.  In the case of a provider-managed or co-managed
   site, the user is expected to configure a &quot;device-reference&quot; (device
   case) that will bind the site-network-access to a particular device
   that the customer ordered.  As each device is already associated with
   a particular location, in such a case the location information is
   retrieved from the device location.  In the case of a
   customer-managed site, the user is expected to configure a
   &quot;location-reference&quot; (location case); this provides a reference to an
   existing configured location and will help with placement.

                                      +---------+

                 Figure 19: Location Information for Sites

   In Figure 19, Site 1 is a customer-managed site with a location &quot;L1&quot;,
   while Site 2 is a provider-managed site for which a CE (CE#1) was
   ordered.  Site 2 is configured with &quot;L2&quot; as its location.  When

   configuring a site-network-access for Site 1, the user will need to
   reference location L1 so that the management system will know that
   the access will need to terminate on this location.  Then, for
   distance reasons, this management system may mesh Site 1 on a PE in
   the Philadelphia POP.  It may also take into account resources
   available on PEs to determine the exact target PE (e.g., least
   loaded).  For Site 2, the user is expected to configure the
   site-network-access with a device-reference to CE#1 so that the
   management system will know that the access must terminate on the
   location of CE#1 and must be connected to CE#1.  For placement of the
   SP side of the access connection, in the case of the nearest PE used,
   it may mesh Site 2 on the Washington POP.

5.6.3.  Constraint/Parameter: Access Type

   The management system needs to elect the access media to connect the
   site to the customer (for example, xDSL, leased line, Ethernet
   backhaul).  The customer may provide some parameters/constraints that
   will provide hints to the management system.

   The bearer container information SHOULD be the first piece of
   information considered when making this decision:

   o  The &quot;requested-type&quot; parameter provides information about the
      media type that the customer would like to use.  If the &quot;strict&quot;
      leaf is equal to &quot;true&quot;, this MUST be considered a strict
      constraint so that the management system cannot connect the site
      with another media type.  If the &quot;strict&quot; leaf is equal to &quot;false&quot;
      (default) and if the requested media type cannot be fulfilled, the
      management system can select another media type.  The supported
      media types SHOULD be communicated by the SP to the customer via a
      mechanism that is out of scope for this document.

   o  The &quot;always-on&quot; leaf defines a strict constraint: if set to
      &quot;true&quot;, the management system MUST elect a media type that is
      &quot;always-on&quot; (e.g., this means no dial-in access type).

   o  The &quot;bearer-reference&quot; parameter is used in cases where the
      customer has already ordered a network connection to the SP apart
      from the L2VPN site and wants to reuse this connection.  The
      string used is an internal reference from the SP and describes the
      already-available connection.  This is also a strict requirement
      that cannot be relaxed.  How the reference is given to the
      customer is out of scope for this document, but as an example,
      when the customer ordered the bearer (through a process that is
      out of scope for this model), the SP may have provided the bearer
      reference that can be used for provisioning services on top.

   Any other internal parameters from the SP can also be used.  The
   management system MAY use other parameters, such as the requested
   &quot;input svc-bandwidth&quot; and &quot;output svc-bandwidth&quot;, to help decide
   which access type to use.

5.6.4.  Constraint: Access Diversity

   Each site-network-access may have one or more constraints that would
   drive the placement of the access.  By default, the model assumes
   that there are no constraints, but allocation of a unique bearer per
   site-network-access is expected.

   In order to help with the different placement scenarios, a
   site-network-access may be tagged using one or multiple group
   identifiers.  The group identifier is a string, so it can accommodate
   both explicit naming of a group of sites (e.g., &quot;multihomed-set1&quot;)
   and the use of a numbered identifier (e.g., 12345678).  The meaning
   of each group-id is local to each customer administrator, and the
   management system MUST ensure that different customers can use the
   same group-ids.  One or more group-ids can also be defined at the
   site level; as a consequence, all site-network-accesses under the
   site MUST inherit the group-ids of the site to which they belong.
   When, in addition to the site group-ids some group-ids are defined at
   the site-network-access level, the management system MUST consider
   the union of all groups (site level and site-network-access level)
   for this particular site-network-access.

   For an already-configured site-network-access, each constraint MUST
   be expressed against a targeted set of site-network-accesses.  This
   site-network-access (i.e., the already-configured
   site-network-access) MUST never be taken into account in the targeted
   set of site-network-accesses -- for example, &quot;My site-network-access
   S must not be connected on the same POP as the site-network-accesses
   that are part of Group 10.&quot;  The set of site-network-accesses against
   which the constraint is evaluated can be expressed as a list of
   groups, &quot;all-other-accesses&quot;, or &quot;all-other-groups&quot;.  The
   all-other-accesses option means that the current site-network-access
   constraint MUST be evaluated against all the other
   site-network-accesses belonging to the current site.  The
   all-other-groups option means that the constraint MUST be evaluated
   against all groups to which the current site-network-access does not
   belong.

   The current model defines multiple constraint-types:

   o  pe-diverse: The current site-network-access MUST NOT be connected
      to the same PE as the targeted site-network-accesses.

   o  pop-diverse: The current site-network-access MUST NOT be connected
      to the same POP as the targeted site-network-accesses.

   o  linecard-diverse: The current site-network-access MUST NOT be
      connected to the same linecard as the targeted site-network-
      accesses.  Note that the customer can request linecard-diverse for
      site-network-accesses, but the specific linecard identifier used
      should not be exposed to the customer.

   o  bearer-diverse: The current site-network-access MUST NOT use
      common bearer components compared to bearers used by the targeted
      site-network-accesses.  &quot;bearer-diverse&quot; provides some level of
      diversity at the access level.  As an example, two bearer-diverse
      site-network-accesses must not use the same Digital Subscriber
      Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM), Broadband Access Switch (BAS), or
      Layer 2 switch.

   o  same-pe: The current site-network-access MUST be connected to the
      same PE as the targeted site-network-accesses.

   o  same-bearer: The current site-network-access MUST be connected
      using the same bearer as the targeted site-network-accesses.

   These constraint-types can be extended through augmentation.  Each
   constraint is expressed as &quot;The site-network-access S must be
   &lt;constraint-type&gt; (e.g., pe-diverse, pop-diverse) from these &lt;target&gt;
   site-network-accesses.&quot;

   The group-id used to target some site-network-accesses may be the
   same as the one used by the current site-network-access.  This eases
   the configuration of scenarios where a group of site-network-access
   points has a constraint between the access points in the group.

5.7.  Route Distinguisher and Network Instance Allocation

   The Route Distinguisher (RD) is a critical parameter of BGP-based
   L2VPNs as described in [RFC4364] that provides the ability to
   distinguish common addressing plans in different VPNs.  As for Route
   Targets (RTs), a management system is expected to allocate a MAC-VRF
   on the target PE and an RD for that MAC-VRF; that RD MUST be unique
   across all MAC-VRFs on the target PE.

   If a MAC-VRF already exists on the target PE and the MAC-VRF fulfills
   the connectivity constraints for the site, there is no need to
   recreate another MAC-VRF, and the site MAY be meshed within the
   existing MAC-VRF.  How the management system checks to see if an
   existing MAC-VRF fulfills the connectivity constraints for a site is
   out of scope for this document.

   If no such MAC-VRF exists on the target PE, the management system has
   to initiate the creation of a new MAC-VRF on the target PE and has to
   allocate a new RD for the new MAC-VRF.

   The management system MAY apply a per-VPN or per-MAC-VRF allocation
   policy for the RD, depending on the SP&#x27;s policy.  In a per-VPN
   allocation policy, all MAC-VRFs (dispatched on multiple PEs) within a
   VPN will share the same RD value.  In a per-MAC-VRF model, all
   MAC-VRFs should always have a unique RD value.  Some other allocation
   policies are also possible, and this document does not restrict the
   allocation policies to be used.

   The allocation of RDs MAY be done in the same way as RTs.  The
   information provided in Section 5.2.2.1 could also be used in this
   scenario.

   Note that an SP MAY configure a target PE for an automated allocation
   of RDs.  In this case, there will be no need for any backend system
   to allocate an RD value.

5.8.  Site-Network-Access Availability

   A site may be multihomed, meaning that it has multiple
   site-network-access points.  The placement constraints defined in
   Section 5.6 will help ensure physical diversity.

   When the site-network-accesses are placed on the network, a customer
   may want to use a particular routing policy on those accesses.  The
   &quot;site-network-access/availability&quot; container defines parameters for
   site redundancy.  The &quot;access-priority&quot; leaf defines a preference for
   a particular access.  This preference is used to model load-balancing
   or primary/backup scenarios.  The higher the access-priority value,
   the higher the preference will be.  The &quot;redundancy-mode&quot; attribute
   is defined for a multihoming site and used to model single-active and
   active/active scenarios.  It allows for multiple active paths in
   forwarding state and for load-balancing options.

   Figure 20 illustrates how the access-priority attribute can be used.

        Hub#1 LAN (Primary/backup)          Hub#2 LAN (Load-sharing)
          |                                                     |
          |    access-priority 1          access-priority 1     |
          |--- CE1 ------- PE1            PE3 --------- CE3 --- |
          |                                                     |
          |                                                     |
          |--- CE2 ------- PE2            PE4 --------- CE4 --- |
          |    access-priority 2          access-priority 1     |

                                  PE5
                                   |
                                   |
                                   |
                                  CE5
                                   |
                              Spoke#1 site (Single-homed)

              Figure 20: Example: Configuring Access Priority

   In Figure 20, Hub#2 requires load-sharing, so all the site-network-
   accesses must use the same access-priority value.  On the other hand,
   as Hub#1 requires a primary site-network-access and a backup
   site-network-access, a higher access-priority setting will be
   configured on the primary site-network-access.

   Scenarios that are more complex can also be modeled.  Let&#x27;s consider
   a Hub site with five accesses to the network (A1, A2, A3, A4, and
   A5).  The customer wants to load-share its traffic on A1 and A2 in
   the nominal situation.  If A1 and A2 fail, the customer wants to
   load-share its traffic on A3 and A4; finally, if A1, A2, A3, and A4
   are all down, the customer wants to use A5.  We can model this easily
   by configuring the following access-priority values: A1=100, A2=100,
   A3=50, A4=50, A5=10.

   The access-priority scenario has some limitations.  An
   access-priority scenario like the previous one with five accesses but
   with the constraint of having traffic load-shared between A3 and A4
   in the case where only A1 or A2 (not both) is down is not achievable.
   But the access-priority attribute defined will cover most of the
   deployment use cases, and if necessary the model can be extended via
   augmentation to support additional use cases.

5.9.  SVC MTU

   The MTU of subscriber service frames can be derived from the physical
   interface MTU by default, or it can be specified under the &quot;svc-mtu&quot;
   leaf if it is different than the default number.

5.10.  Service

   The service container defines service parameters associated with
   the site.

5.10.1.  Bandwidth

   The service bandwidth refers to the bandwidth requirement between the
   CE and the PE and can be represented using the Committed Information
   Rate (CIR), the Excess Information Rate (EIR), or the Peak
   Information Rate (PIR).  The requested bandwidth is expressed as
   ingress bandwidth and egress bandwidth.  The ingress or egress
   direction uses the customer site as the point of reference:
   &quot;ingress-direction bandwidth&quot; refers to download bandwidth for the
   site, and &quot;egress-direction bandwidth&quot; refers to upload bandwidth for
   the site.

   The service bandwidth is only configurable at the site-network-access
   level (i.e., for the site network access associated with the site).

   Using a different ingress and egress bandwidth will allow an SP to
   know if a customer allows for asymmetric bandwidth access like ADSL.
   It can also be used to set the rate limit in a different way for
   uploads and downloads on symmetric bandwidth access.

   The svc-bandwidth parameter has a specific type.  This document
   defines four types:

   o  bw-per-access: bandwidth is per connection or site network access,
      providing rate enforcement for all service frames at the interface
      that are associated with a particular network access.

   o  bw-per-cos: bandwidth is per CoS, providing rate enforcement for
      all service frames for a given CoS with a specific cos-id.

   o  bw-per-svc: bandwidth is per site, providing rate enforcement for
      all service frames that are associated with a particular VPN
      service.

   o  opaque bandwidth is the total bandwidth that is not associated
      with any particular cos-id, VPN service identified with the
      vpn-id, or site network access ID.

   &quot;type&quot; is set to &quot;bw-per-cos&quot;.  The cos-id can be assigned based on
   either (1) the IEEE 802.1p value [IEEE-802-1D] in the C-tag or
   (2) the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) in the IP
   header.  Service frames are metered against the bandwidth

   with the same site network access.

   The svc-bandwidth parameter must include a specific &quot;vpn-id&quot;
   parameter if the &quot;type&quot; is set to &quot;bw-per-svc&quot;.  Multiple bandwidths
   per cos-id can be associated with the same EVPN service.

5.10.2.  QoS

   The model defines QoS parameters as an abstraction:

   o  qos-classification-policy: Defines a set of ordered rules to
      classify customer traffic.

   o  qos-profile: Provides a QoS scheduling profile to be applied.

5.10.2.1.  QoS Classification

   QoS classification rules are handled by &quot;qos-classification-policy&quot;.
   qos-classification-policy is an ordered list of rules that match a
   flow or application and set the appropriate target CoS
   (target-class-id).  The user can define the match using a
   more specific flow definition (based on Layer 2 source and
   destination MAC addresses, cos, dscp, cos-id, color-id, etc.).  A
   &quot;color-id&quot; will be assigned to a service frame to identify its QoS
   profile conformance.  A service frame is &quot;green&quot; if it is conformant
   with the &quot;committed&quot; rate of the bandwidth profile.  A service frame
   is &quot;yellow&quot; if it exceeds the &quot;committed&quot; rate but is conformant with
   the &quot;excess&quot; rate of the bandwidth profile.  Finally, a service frame
   is &quot;red&quot; if it is conformant with neither the &quot;committed&quot; rate nor
   the &quot;excess&quot; rate of the bandwidth profile.

   When a flow definition is used, the user can use a target-sites
   leaf-list to identify the destination of a flow rather than using
   destination addresses.  In such a case, an association between the
   site abstraction and the MAC addresses used by this site must be done
   dynamically.  How this association is done is out of scope for this
   document.  The association of a site to an L2VPN is done through the
   vpn-attachment container.  Therefore, the user can also employ the

   &quot;target-sites&quot; leaf-list and &quot;vpn-attachment&quot; to identify the
   destination of a flow targeted to a specific VPN service.  A rule
   that does not have a &quot;match&quot; statement is considered a &quot;match-all&quot;
   rule.  An SP may implement a default terminal classification rule if
   the customer does not provide it.  It will be up to the SP to
   determine its default target class.  This model defines some
   applications, but new application identities may be added through
   augmentation.  The exact meaning of each application identity is up
   to the SP, so it will be necessary for the SP to advise the customer
   on the usage of application-matching.

5.10.2.2.  QoS Profile

   A user can choose between the standard profile provided by the
   operator or a custom profile.  The QoS profile (&quot;qos-profile&quot;)
   defines the traffic-scheduling policy to be used by the SP.

   A custom QoS profile is defined as a list of CoS entries and
   associated properties.  The properties are as follows:

   o  direction: Used to specify the direction to which the qos-profile
      setting is applied.  This model supports the site-to-WAN direction
      (&quot;site-to-wan&quot;), the WAN-to-site direction (&quot;wan-to-site&quot;), and
      both directions (&quot;bidirectional&quot;).  By default, &quot;bidirectional&quot; is
      used.  In the case of both directions, the provider should ensure
      scheduling according to the requested policy in both traffic
      directions (SP to customer and customer to SP).  As an example, a
      device-scheduling policy may be implemented on both the PE side
      and the CE side of the WAN link.  In the case of the WAN-to-site
      direction, the provider should ensure scheduling from the SP
      network to the customer site.  As an example, a device-scheduling
      policy may be implemented only on the PE side of the WAN link
      towards the customer.

   o  policing: Optional.  Indicates whether policing should apply to
      one-rate, two-color or to two-rate, three-color.

   o  byte-offset: Optional.  Indicates how many bytes in the service
      frame header are excluded from rate enforcement.

   o  frame-delay: Used to define the latency constraint of the class.
      The latency constraint can be expressed as the lowest possible
      latency or as a latency boundary expressed in milliseconds.  How
      this latency constraint will be fulfilled is up to the SP
      implementation: a strict priority-queuing mechanism may be used on
      the access and in the core network, or a low-latency routing path
      may be created for this traffic class.

   o  frame-jitter: Used to define the jitter constraint of the class.
      The jitter constraint can be expressed as the lowest possible
      jitter or as a jitter boundary expressed in microseconds.  How
      this jitter constraint will be fulfilled is up to the SP
      implementation: a strict priority-queuing mechanism may be used on
      the access and in the core network, or a jitter-aware routing path
      may be created for this traffic class.

   o  bandwidth: Used to define a guaranteed amount of bandwidth for
      the CoS.  It is expressed as a percentage.  The
      &quot;guaranteed-bw-percent&quot; parameter uses available bandwidth as a
      reference.  The available bandwidth should not fall below the CIR
      value defined under the input svc-bandwidth or the output
      svc-bandwidth.  When the &quot;qos-profile&quot; container is implemented on
      the CE side, the output svc-bandwidth is taken into account as a
      reference.  When it is implemented on the PE side, the input
      svc-bandwidth is used.  By default, the bandwidth reservation is
      only guaranteed at the access level.  The user can use the
      &quot;end-to-end&quot; leaf to request an end-to-end bandwidth reservation,
      including across the MPLS transport network.  (In other words, the
      SP will activate something in the MPLS core to ensure that the
      bandwidth request from the customer will be fulfilled by the MPLS
      core as well.)  How this is done (e.g., RSVP-TE reservation,
      controller reservation) is out of scope for this document.

   In addition, due to network conditions, some constraints may not be
   completely fulfilled by the SP; in this case, the SP should advise
   the customer about the limitations.  How this communication is done
   is out of scope for this document.

5.10.3.  Support for BUM

   The &quot;broadcast-unknown-unicast-multicast&quot; container defines the type
   of site in the customer multicast service topology: source, receiver,
   or both.  These parameters will help the management system optimize
   the multicast service.

   Multiple multicast group-to-port mappings can be created using the
   &quot;multicast-gp-address-mapping&quot; list.  The
   &quot;multicast-gp-address-mapping&quot; list defines the multicast group
   address and port LAG number.  Those parameters will help the SP
   select the appropriate association between an interface and a
   multicast group to fulfill the customer service requirement.

   To ensure that a given frame is transparently transported, a whole
   Layer 2 multicast frame (whether for data or control) should not be
   altered from a CE to other CEs, except for the VLAN ID field.  VLAN
   IDs assigned by the SP can also be altered.

   For point-to-point services, the provider only needs to deliver a
   single copy of each service frame to the remote PE, regardless of
   whether the destination MAC address of the incoming frame is unicast,
   multicast, or broadcast.  Therefore, all service frames should be
   delivered unconditionally.

   BUM frame forwarding in multipoint-to-multipoint services, on the
   other hand, involves both local flooding to other ACs on the same PE
   and remote replication to all other PEs, thus consuming additional
   resources and core bandwidth.  Special BUM frame disposition rules
   can be implemented at external-facing interfaces (UNIs or External
   NNIs (E-NNIs)) to rate-limit the BUM frames, in terms of the number
   of packets per second or bits per second.

   The threshold can apply to all BUM traffic, or one threshold can be
   applied for each category of traffic.

5.11.  Site Management

   The &quot;management&quot; sub-container is intended for site management
   options, depending on device ownership and security access control.
   Three common management models are as follows:

   Provider-managed CE:  The provider has sole ownership of the CE
      device.  Only the provider has access to the CE.  The
      responsibility boundary between the SP and the customer is between
      the CE and the customer network.  This is the most common
      use case.

   Customer-managed CE:  The customer has sole ownership of the CE
      device.  Only the customer has access to the CE.  In this model,
      the responsibility boundary between the SP and the customer is
      between the PE and the CE.

   Co-managed CE:  The provider has ownership of the CE device and is
      responsible for managing the CE.  However, the provider grants the
      customer access to the CE for some configuration/monitoring
      purposes.  In this co-managed mode, the responsibility boundary is
      the same as for the provider-managed model.

   The selected management mode is specified under the &quot;type&quot; leaf.  The
   &quot;address&quot; leaf stores CE device management addressing information.
   The &quot;management-transport&quot; leaf is used to identify the transport
   protocol for management traffic: IPv4 or IPv6.  Additional security
   options may be derived based on the particular management model
   selected.

5.12.  MAC Loop Protection

   MAC address flapping between different physical ports typically
   indicates a bridge loop condition in the customer network.
   Misleading entries in the MAC cache table can cause service frames to
   circulate around the network indefinitely and saturate the links
   throughout the provider&#x27;s network, affecting other services in the
   same network.  In the case of EVPNs, it also introduces massive BGP
   updates and control-plane instability.

   The SP may opt to implement a switching loop-prevention mechanism at
   the external-facing interfaces for multipoint-to-multipoint services
   by imposing a MAC address move threshold.

   The MAC move rate and prevention-type options are listed in the
   &quot;mac-loop-prevention&quot; container.

5.13.  MAC Address Limit

   The optional &quot;mac-addr-limit&quot; container contains the customer MAC
   address limit and information that describes the action taken when
   the limit is exceeded and the aging time for a MAC address.

   When multiple services are provided on the same network element, the
   MAC address table (and the Routing Information Base space for
   MAC routes in the case of EVPNs) is a shared common resource.  SPs
   may impose a maximum number of MAC addresses learned from the
   customer for a single service instance by using the &quot;mac-addr-limit&quot;
   leaf and may use the &quot;action&quot; leaf to specify the action taken when
   the upper limit is exceeded: drop the packet, flood the packet, or
   simply send a warning log message.

   For point-to-point services, if MAC learning is disabled, then the
   MAC address limit is not necessary.

5.14.  Enhanced VPN Features

5.14.1.  Carriers&#x27; Carriers

   In the case of Carriers&#x27; Carriers (CsC) [RFC8299], a customer may
   want to build an MPLS service using an L2VPN to carry its traffic.

                 LAN customer1
                    |
                    |

                    | -------------
                 (vrf_cust1)

                    |

                   PE1

                  (...)               Provider backbone

                   PE2
                  (vrf ISP1)
                    |
                    | ------------
                    |
                    | MPLS link
                    |                 ISP1 POP
                   CE2_ISP1
                   (vrf_cust1)
                    | ------------
                    |
                   CE2
                    |
                 LAN customer1

          Figure 21: MPLS Service Using an L2VPN to Carry Traffic

   In Figure 21, ISP1 resells an L2VPN service but has no core network
   infrastructure between its POPs.  ISP1 uses an L2VPN as the core
   network infrastructure (belonging to another provider) between
   its POPs.

   In order to support CsC, the VPN service must indicate MPLS support
   by setting the &quot;carrierscarrier&quot; leaf to &quot;true&quot; in the vpn-service
   list.  The link between CE1_ISP1/PE1 and CE2_ISP1/PE2 must also run
   an MPLS signaling protocol.  This configuration is done at the site
   level.

   In this model, LDP or BGP can be used as the MPLS signaling protocol.
   In the case of LDP, an IGP routing protocol MUST also be activated.
   In the case of BGP signaling, BGP MUST also be configured as the
   routing protocol.

   If CsC is enabled, the requested &quot;svc-mtu&quot; leaf will refer to the
   MPLS MTU and not to the link MTU.

5.15.  External ID References

   The service model sometimes refers to external information through
   identifiers.  As an example, to order cloud access to a particular
   Cloud Service Provider (CSP), the model uses an identifier to refer
   to the targeted CSP.  If a customer is directly using this service
   model as an API (through RESTCONF or NETCONF, for example) to order a
   particular service, the SP should provide a list of authorized
   identifiers.  In the case of cloud access, the SP will provide the
   associated identifiers for each available CSP.  The same applies to
   other identifiers, such as qos-profile.

   As a usage example, the remote-carrier-name setting is used in the
   NNI case because it should be known by the current L2VPN SP to which
   it is connecting, while the cloud-identifier setting should be known
   by both the current L2VPN SP and the customer because it is applied
   to the public cloud or Internet access.

   How an SP provides the meanings of those identifiers to the customer
   is out of scope for this document.

5.16.  Defining NNIs and Inter-AS Support

   An Autonomous System (AS) is a single network or group of networks
   that are controlled by a common system administration group and that
   use a single, clearly defined routing protocol.  In some cases, VPNs
   need to span different ASes in different geographical areas or span
   different SPs.  The connection between ASes is established by the SPs
   and is seamless to the customer.  Examples include:

   o  A partnership between SPs (e.g., carrier, cloud) to extend their
      VPN services seamlessly.

   o  An internal administrative boundary within a single SP (e.g.,
      backhaul versus core versus data center).

   NNIs have to be defined to extend the VPNs across multiple ASes.
   [RFC4761] defines multiple flavors of VPN NNI implementations (e.g.,
   VPLSs).  Each implementation has pros and cons; this topic is outside
   the scope of this document.  For example, in an inter-AS option A
   (two ASes), AS Border Router (ASBR) peers are connected by multiple
   interfaces with at least one of those interfaces spanning the two
   ASes while being present in the same VPN.  In order for these ASBRs
   to signal label blocks, they associate each interface with a MAC-VRF
   (VSI) (Section 2) and a BGP session.  As a result, traffic between
   devices in the back-to-back VPLS is Ethernet.  In this scenario, the
   VPNs are isolated from each other, and because the traffic is
   Ethernet, QoS mechanisms that operate on Ethernet traffic can be
   applied to achieve customer SLAs.

                  Figure 22: SP Network with Several NNIs

   Figure 22 illustrates an SP network called &quot;My network&quot; that has
   several NNIs.  This network uses NNIs to:

   o  increase its footprint by relying on L2VPN partners.

   o  connect its own data-center services to the customer L2VPN.

   o  enable the customer to access its private resources located in a
      private cloud owned by some CSPs.

        Figure 23: NNI Defined with the Option A Flavor: Example 1

   In option A, the two ASes are connected to each other with physical
   links on ASBRs.  For resiliency purposes, there may be multiple
   physical connections between the ASes.  A VPN connection -- physical
   or logical (on top of physical) -- is created for each VPN that needs
   to cross the AS boundary, thus providing a back-to-back VPLS model.

   From a service model&#x27;s perspective, this VPN connection can be seen
   as a site.  Let&#x27;s say that AS B wants to extend some VPN connections
   for VPN C on AS A.  The administrator of AS B can use this service
   model to order a site on AS A.  All connection scenarios could be
   realized using the features of the current model.  As an example,
   Figure 23 shows two physical connections that have logical
   connections per VPN overlaid on them.  This could be seen as a
   multi-VPN scenario.  Also, the administrator of AS B will be able to

   choose the appropriate routing protocol (e.g., External BGP (EBGP))
   to dynamically exchange routes between ASes.

   This document assumes that the option A NNI flavor SHOULD reuse the
   existing VPN site modeling.

   Figure 24 illustrates an example where a customer wants its CSP A to
   attach its virtual network N to an existing L2VPN (VPN1) that it has
   from L2VPN SP B.

        Figure 24: NNI Defined with the Option A Flavor: Example 2

   To create the VPN connectivity, the CSP or the customer may use the
   L2SM that SP B exposes.  We could consider that, as the NNI is
   shared, the physical connection (bearer) between CSP A and SP B
   already exists.  CSP A may request through a service model the
   creation of a new site with a single site-network-access
   (single-homing is used in Figure 24).  As a placement constraint, CSP
   A may use the existing bearer reference it has from SP A to force the
   placement of the VPN NNI on the existing link.  The XML below
   illustrates a possible configuration request to SP B:

   The case described above is different from a scenario using the
   cloud-accesses container, as the cloud-access provides a public cloud
   access while this example enables access to private resources located
   in a CSP network.

        Figure 25: NNI Defined with the Option B Flavor: Example 1

   In option B, the two ASes are connected to each other with physical
   links on ASBRs.  For resiliency purposes, there may be multiple
   physical connections between the ASes.  The VPN &quot;connection&quot; between
   ASes is done by exchanging VPN routes through MP-BGP [RFC4761].

   There are multiple flavors of implementations of such an NNI.  For
   example:

   1.  The NNI is internal to the provider and is situated between a
       backbone and a data center.  There is enough trust between the
       domains to not filter the VPN routes.  So, all the VPN routes are
       exchanged.  RT filtering may be implemented to save some
       unnecessary route states.

   2.  The NNI is used between providers that agreed to exchange VPN
       routes for specific RTs only.  Each provider is authorized to use
       the RT values from the other provider.

   3.  The NNI is used between providers that agreed to exchange VPN
       routes for specific RTs only.  Each provider has its own RT
       scheme.  So, a customer spanning the two networks will have
       different RTs in each network for a particular VPN.

   Case 1 does not require any service modeling, as the protocol enables
   the dynamic exchange of necessary VPN routes.

   Case 2 requires that an RT-filtering policy on ASBRs be maintained.
   From a service-modeling point of view, it is necessary to agree on
   the list of RTs to authorize.

   In Case 3, both ASes need to agree on the VPN RT to exchange, as well
   as how to map a VPN RT from AS A to the corresponding RT in AS B (and
   vice versa).

   Those modelings are currently out of scope for this document.

      VM = Virtual Machine

        Figure 26: NNI Defined with the Option B Flavor: Example 2

   Figure 26 shows an NNI connection between CSP A and SP network B.
   The SPs do not trust each other and use different RT allocation
   policies.  So, in terms of implementation, the customer VPN has a
   different RT in each network (RT A in CSP A and RT B in SP
   network B).  In order to connect the customer&#x27;s virtual network in
   CSP A to the customer&#x27;s L2VPN (VPN1) in SP network B, CSP A should
   request that SP network B open the customer VPN on the NNI (accept
   the appropriate RT).  Who does the RT translation depends on the
   agreement between the two SPs: SP B may permit CSP A to request VPN
   (RT) translation.

              Figure 27: NNI Defined with the Option C Flavor

   From a VPN service&#x27;s perspective, the option C NNI is very similar to
   option B, as an MP-BGP session is used to exchange VPN routes between
   the ASes.  The difference is that the forwarding plane and the
   control plane are on different nodes, so the MP-BGP session is
   multihop between routing gateway (RGW) nodes.  From a VPN service&#x27;s
   point of view, modeling options B and C will be configured
   identically.

5.17.  Applicability of L2SM in Inter-provider and Inter-domain
       Orchestration

   In the case where the ASes belong to different providers, one might
   imagine that providers would like to have fewer signaling sessions
   crossing the AS boundary and that the entities that terminate the
   sessions could be restricted to a smaller set of devices.  Two
   approaches can be taken:

   a.  Construct inter-provider control connections to run only between
       the two border routers.

   b.  Allow end-to-end, multi-segment connectivity to be constructed
       out of several connectivity segments, without maintaining an
       end-to-end control connection.

   Inter-provider control connections as described in approach (a) can
   be realized using the techniques provided in Section 5.16 (e.g.,
   defining NNIs).  Multi-segment connectivity as described in
   approach (b) can produce an inter-AS solution that more closely
   resembles scheme (b) in Section 10 of [RFC4364].  It may be realized
   using &quot;stitching&quot; of per-site connectivity and service segments at
   different domains, e.g., end-to-end connectivity between Site 1 and
   Site 3 spans multiple domains (e.g., metropolitan area networks) and
   can be constructed by stitching network access connectivity within
   Site 1 with SEG1, SEG3, and SEG4, and network access connectivity
   within Site 3 (as shown in Figure 28).  The assumption is that the
   service orchestration component in Figure 3 should have visibility
   into the complete abstract topology and resource availability.  This
   may rely on network planning.

     Figure 28: Example: Inter-provider and Inter-domain Orchestration

   Note that SEG1, SEG2, SEG3, SEG4, SEG5, and SEG6 can also be regarded
   as network access connectivity within a site and can be created as a
   normal site using the L2SM.

   In Figure 28, we use BGP redistribution of L2VPN Network Layer
   Reachability Information (NLRI) instances from AS to neighboring AS.
   First, the PE routers use BGP to redistribute L2VPN NLRIs to either
   an ASBR or a route reflector of which an ASBR is a client.  The ASBR
   then uses BGP to redistribute those L2VPN NLRIs to an ASBR in another
   AS, which in turn distributes them to the PE routers in that AS, or
   perhaps to another ASBR that in turn distributes them, and so on.

   In this case, a PE can learn the address of an ASBR through which it
   could reach another PE to which it wishes to establish connectivity.
   That is, a local PE will receive a BGP advertisement containing an
   L2VPN NLRI corresponding to an L2VPN instance in which the local PE
   has some attached members.  The BGP next hop for that L2VPN NLRI will
   be an ASBR of the local AS.  Then, rather than building a control
   connection all the way to the remote PE, it builds one only to the
   ASBR.  A connectivity segment can now be established from the PE to
   the ASBR.  The ASBR in turn can establish connectivity to the ASBR of
   the next AS and then stitch that connectivity to the connectivity
   from the PE as described in [RFC6073].  Repeating the process at each
   ASBR leads to a sequence of connectivity segments that, when stitched
   together, connect the two PEs.

   Note that in the approach just described, the local PE may never
   learn the IP address of the remote PE.  It learns the L2VPN NLRI
   advertised by the remote PE, which need not contain the remote PE
   address, and it learns the IP address of the ASBR that is the BGP
   next hop for that NLRI.

   When this approach is used for VPLS or for full-mesh VPWS, it leads
   to a full mesh of connectivity among the PEs, but it does not require
   a full mesh of control connections (LDP or L2TPv3 sessions).
   Instead, the control connections within a single AS run among all the
   PEs of that AS and the ASBRs of the AS.  A single control connection
   between the ASBRs of adjacent ASes can be used to support as many
   AS-to-AS connectivity segments as may be needed.

6.  Interaction with Other YANG Modules

   As explained in Section 4, this service model is not intended to
   configure network elements; rather, it is instantiated in a
   management system.

   The management system might follow modular design and comprise two
   different components:

   a.  The component instantiating the service model (let&#x27;s call it the
       service component).

   b.  The component responsible for network element configuration
       (let&#x27;s call it the configuration component).

   In some cases, when a split is needed between the behavior and
   functions that a customer requests and the technology that the
   network operator has available to deliver the service [RFC8309], a
   new component can be separated out of the service component (let&#x27;s
   call it the control component).  This component is responsible for
   network-centric operation and is aware of many features such as
   topology, technology, and operator policy.  As an optional component,
   it can use the service model as input and is not required at all if
   the control component delegates its control operations to the
   configuration component.

   In Section 7, we provide an example of translation of service
   provisioning requests to router configuration lines as an
   illustration.  In the YANG-based ecosystem, it is expected that
   NETCONF and YANG will be used between the configuration component and
   network elements to configure the requested service on those
   elements.

   In this framework, it is expected that YANG data models will be used
   to configure service components on network elements.  There will be a
   strong relationship between the abstracted view provided by this
   service model and the detailed configuration view that will be
   provided by specific configuration models for network elements such

   as those defined in [MPLS-L2VPN-YANG] and [EVPN-YANG].  Service
   components that would need configuration of network elements in
   support of the service model defined in this document include:

   o  Network instance definitions that include defined VPN policies.

   o  Physical interfaces.

   o  Ethernet-layer parameters (e.g., VLAN IDs).

   o  QoS: classification, profiles, etc.

   o  Support for Ethernet Service OAM.

7.  Service Model Usage Example

   As explained in Section 4, this service model is intended to be
   instantiated at a management layer and is not intended to be used
   directly on network elements.  The management system serves as a
   central point of configuration of the overall service.

   This section provides an example of how a management system can use
   this model to configure an L2VPN service on network elements.

   This example provides a VPN service for three sites using
   point-to-point VPWS and a Hub-and-Spoke VPN service topology as shown
   in Figure 29.  Load balancing is not considered in this case.

   The following XML describes the overall simplified service
   configuration of this VPN.

       &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;

               &lt;vpn-svc-type&gt;vpws&lt;/vpn-svc-type&gt;
               &lt;svc-topo&gt;hub-spoke&lt;/svc-topo&gt;
               &lt;ce-vlan-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-preservation&gt;
               &lt;ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;
              &lt;/vpn-service&gt;
             &lt;vpn-service&gt;
               &lt;vpn-id&gt;12456488&lt;/vpn-id&gt;
               &lt;vpn-svc-type&gt;vpws&lt;/vpn-svc-type&gt;
               &lt;svc-topo&gt;hub-spoke&lt;/svc-topo&gt;
               &lt;ce-vlan-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-preservation&gt;
               &lt;ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;true&lt;/ce-vlan-cos-preservation&gt;
              &lt;/vpn-service&gt;
         &lt;/vpn-services&gt;
       &lt;/l2vpn-svc&gt;

   When receiving the request for provisioning the VPN service, the
   management system will internally (or through communication with
   another OSS component) allocate VPN RTs.  In this specific case, two
   RTs will be allocated (100:1 for Hubs and 100:2 for Spokes).  The
   output below describes the configuration of Spoke Site 1.

                  &lt;/management&gt;

          &lt;/sites&gt;
      &lt;/l2vpn-svc&gt;

   When receiving the request for provisioning Spoke Site 1, the
   management system MUST allocate network resources for this site.  It
   MUST first determine the target network elements to provision the
   access and, in particular, the PE router (or possibly an aggregation
   switch).  As described in Sections 5.3.1 and 5.6, the management
   system SHOULD use the location information and MUST use the
   access-diversity constraint to find the appropriate PE.  In this
   case, we consider that Spoke Site 1 requires PE diversity with Hubs
   and that the management system will allocate PEs based on least
   distance.  Based on the location information, the management system
   finds the available PEs in the area closest to the customer and picks
   one that fits the access-diversity constraint.

   When the PE is chosen, the management system needs to allocate
   interface resources on the node.  One interface is selected from the
   PE&#x27;s available pool of resources.  The management system can start
   provisioning the PE node using any means it wishes (e.g., NETCONF,
   CLI).  The management system will check to see if a VSI that fits its
   needs is already present.  If not, it will provision the VSI: the RD
   will come from the internal allocation policy model, and the RTs will
   come from the vpn-policy configuration of the site (i.e., the
   management system will allocate some RTs for the VPN).  As the site
   is a Spoke site (site-role), the management system knows which RTs
   must be imported and exported.  As the site is provider managed, some
   management RTs may also be added (100:5000).  Standard provider VPN
   policies MAY also be added in the configuration.

   Example of a generated PE configuration:

l2vpn vsi context one
  vpn id 12456487
     autodiscovery bgp signaling bgp
     ve id 1001     &lt;---- identify the PE routers within the VPLS domain
     ve range 50    &lt;---- VPLS Edge (VE) size
     route-distinguisher 100:3123234324
     route-target import 100:1
     route-target import 100:5000    &lt;---- Standard SP configuration
     route-target export 100:2               for provider-managed CE
   !

   When the VSI has been provisioned, the management system can start
   configuring the access on the PE using the allocated interface
   information.  The tag or VLAN (e.g., service instance tag) is chosen
   by the management system.  One tag will be picked from an allocated
   subnet for the PE, and another will be used for the CE configuration.

   LACP protocols will also be configured between the PE and the CE; in
   the case of the provider-managed model, the choice is left to the SP.
   This choice is independent of the LACP protocol chosen by the
   customer.

   Example of a generated PE configuration:

   !
   bridge-domain 1
    member Ethernet0/0 service-instance 100
    member vsi one
   !
   l2 router-id 198.51.100.1
   !
   l2 router-id 2001:db8::10:1/64
   !

   interface Ethernet0/0
    no ip address
    service instance 100 ethernet
   encapsulation dot1q 100
    !

   !
   router bgp 1
    bgp log-neighbor-changes
    neighbor 198.51.100.4 remote-as 1
    neighbor 198.51.100.4 update-source Loopback0
    !
    address-family l2vpn vpls
     neighbor 198.51.100.4 activate
     neighbor 198.51.100.4 send-community extended
     neighbor 198.51.100.4 suppress-signaling-protocol ldp
     neighbor 2001:db8::0a10:4 activate
     neighbor 2001:db8::0a10:4 send-community extended
    exit-address-family

   !
   interface vlan 100     &lt;---- Associating the AC with
     no ip address                the MAC-VRF at the PE
     xconnect vsi PE1-VPLS-A
   !
   vlan 100
     state active

   As the CE router is not reachable at this stage, the management
   system can produce a complete CE configuration that can be manually
   uploaded to the node (e.g., before sending the CE to the customer
   premises at the appropriate postal address, as described in
   Section 5.3.1).  The CE configuration will be built in the same way
   as the PE configuration is built.  Based on (1) the CE type
   (vendor/model) allocated to the customer and (2) bearer information,
   the management system knows which interface must be configured on the
   CE.  PE-CE link configuration is expected to be handled automatically
   using the SP&#x27;s OSS, as both resources are managed internally.
   CE-to-LAN interface parameters, such as dot1Q tags, are derived from
   the Ethernet connection, taking into account how the management
   system distributes dot1Q tags between the PE and the CE within the
   subnet.  This will allow a plug&#x27;n&#x27;play configuration to be produced
   for the CE.

   Example of a generated CE configuration:

   interface Ethernet0/1
     switchport trunk allowed vlan none
     switchport mode trunk
     service instance 100 ethernet
     encapsulation default
     l2protocol forward cdp
     xconnect 203.0.113.1 100 encapsulation mpls
   !

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /l2vpn-svc/vpn-services/vpn-service

      The entries in the list above include all of the VPN service
      configurations to which the customer subscribes and will use to
      indirectly create or modify the PE and CE device configurations.
      Unexpected changes to these entries could lead to service
      disruptions and/or network misbehavior.

   o  /l2vpn-svc/sites/site

      The entries in the list above include the customer site
      configurations.  As noted in the previous paragraph, unexpected
      changes to these entries could lead to service disruptions and/or
      network misbehavior.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /l2vpn-svc/vpn-services/vpn-service

   o  /l2vpn-svc/sites/site

   The entries in the lists above include customer-proprietary or
   confidential information, e.g., customer name, site location,
   services to which the customer subscribes.

   When an SP collaborates with multiple customers, it has to ensure
   that a given customer can only view and modify its (the customer&#x27;s)
   own service information.

   The data model defines some security parameters that can be extended
   via augmentation as part of the customer service request; those
   parameters are described in Sections 5.12 and 5.13.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a new URI from the &quot;IETF XML Registry&quot; [RFC3688].

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l2vpn-svc
      Registrant Contact: The IESG
      XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace

   IANA has assigned a new YANG module name in the &quot;YANG Module Names&quot;
   registry [RFC6020].

      name: ietf-l2vpn-svc
      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l2vpn-svc
      prefix: l2vpn-svc
      reference: RFC 8466
