1. Abstract 
    
   There has been a recent activity towards the use of GMPLS-based 
   protocols (CR-LDP and RSVP-TE) for automatic switched optical 
   networks (ASON) at the ITU-T. ASON control plane requirements 
   mandates the separate treatment of call and connection control. This 
   draft proposes additional CR-LDP messages necessary for satisfying 
   this goal.

3. Introduction 
    
   Automatic Switched optical networks (ASON) architecture [3] and 
   GMPLS are progressing in parallel at the ITU-T and IETF 
   respectively. As it has been pointed out in [4], the two efforts are 
   complementary in the sense that GMPLS-based protocol could be used 
   for the realization of ASON control plane. Recently GMPLS-based

   protocols have been submitted to ITU-T [5,6] as possible candidates 
   for ASON signaling implementation as defined in G.7713 [7]. 
    
   One important architecture principle of ASON is that call and 
   connection control are treated separately. With this separation 
   there could be the case where a single call has one or more 
   connections associated to it. It is also quite possible to have a 
   call with no connections associated to it, for example during 
   recovery times. 
    
   The current set of GMPLS signaling protocols, i.e. CR-LDP and RSVP-
   TE do not support this requirement. In reality the notion of a call 
   is absent in both protocols. A label switched path (LSP), or a 
   connection, is set end-to-end by assigning a set of labels on the 
   different nodes along the path. Once an LSP is deleted, all the 
   information regarding its end points is lost. 
    
   This draft describes messages necessary to introduce call and 
   connection control separation to CR-LDP. 
    
    
4. CR-LDP Call Control  
    
   As it has been stated in [8], (CR-)LDP employs four categories of 
   messages. Those categories are: 
    
   1. Discovery messages, use to announce and maintain the presence of 
   a network element in the network 
    
   2. Session messages, used to establish, maintain, and terminate LDP 
   sessions between LDP pairs 
    
   3. Advertisement messages, used to create, change, and delete label 
   mappings 
    
   4. Notification messages, used to provide advisory information to 
   signal error information. 
    
   A new category related to query messages was introduced in [9] and 
   is used to query different information related to an operational LSP 
   (connection). 
    
   The third category of the above list is the one that is supposed to 
   be used for connection creation, deletion, and modification in an 
   optical network. New connection is created by assigning a 
   generalized ingress and egress labels at every node along the path 
   of the connection. This process is achieved using Label Request and 
   Label Mapping messages, which carry in their TLVs the necessary 
   characteristics of the required connection. Label Request and Label 
   Mapping requests and confirm the assignment of a generalized label 
   to a connection. In a similar way Label Withdraw and Label Release 
   Messages are used to delete a connection by releasing the label 
   assigned to it.

   The processes described here are all at the connection level since 
   they all involve request, assignment, or release of a label. In 
   contrast to that, with the separation of call and connection in 
   mind, the setup of a call MUST not involve any of those processes. A 
   call setup is mainly for the exchange of call control information 
   between the two end points of a call. Thus there is the need for the 
   introduction of a new category specifically for call control. The 
   new category is called here "call control messages". 
    
4.1 CR-LDP Call Control Messages 
    
   This section describes those additional messages that are needed to 
   support the separation of call and connection control requirements 
   in ASON. 
    
   A mechanism for call setup and deletion is needed for CR-LDP to 
   support call control that is separate from that of the connection 
   control part described previously. This mechanism necessitates the 
   introduction of two CR-LDP messages, Call Setup and Call Delete 
   messages. 
    
   The calling party sends the Call Setup message and it carries 
   information related to the calling and called parties, e.g. their 
   addresses, etc. It may also carry information related to the service 
   level agreement (SLA) associated to a particular call. 
    
   The Call Delete message could be initiated by any network entity 
   (network or client) to terminate a call. All connections associated 
   with this call have to be cleared before clearing the call. 
    
   The formats and procedures for Call Setup and Call Delete are given 
   in section 5. 
    
4.2 Impact on Other (CR-)LDP Messages 
    
   The introduction of call control messages is expected to have some 
   impact on other (CR-)LDP messages in two ways. The first impact is 
   related to new TLV added to some of the messages. For instance, with 
   the call and connection control separation, it is necessary to 
   introduce a call association indication to the Label Request message 
   to indicate the call for which the requested connection is 
   associated. The impact on LDP messages are described in section 6. 
    
    
    
5. Call Setup and Call Delete Messages 
    
   This section describes the encoding of the two messages related to 
   CR-LDP call control.

     Particular the calling and called party addresses. 
    
      The Call Setup message MUST include call identifier TLV. The call 
     control entity shall identify the call using the selected 
     identifier for the lifetime of the call.

      The Call Setup message shall progress through the network to the 
     called party. The called party may accept or reject the incoming 
     call. An LDP Notification message with the appropriate status code 
     (to be defined) shall be used to inform the calling party whether 
     the setup is successful. The call can be rejected by either the 
     network, e.g. for policy reasons, or by the called party.

   Message ID: 
        32-bit value used to identify this message 
    
   Calling Party Number TLV: 
      Same as for Call Setup Message 
    
   Called Party Number TLV: 
      Same as for Call Setup message 
    
   Call ID TLV: 
      Same as for Call Setup message 
    
   Procedure: 
      The Call Delete message is sent by any entity of the network to 
     indicate the desire to terminate an already established call. The 
     Call Setup message SHALL contain all the information required by 
     the network to process the call. In Particular the calling and 
     called party addresses. Confirmation of call deletion is indicated 
     to the request initiator using a Notification message with the 
     appropriate status code.  
    
6. Impact on Other LDP Messages 
    
   The separation of call and connection control allows one or more 
   connection to be associated to the same call. This will have an 
   impact on existing LDP messages relevant to the establishment and 
   deletion of a connection (LSP). The full impact on LDP messages in

   terms of additional TLVs and procedures will be addressed in future 
   revisions pf the draft. 
 
    
    
7. Security Considerations 
 
   This draft doesn't introduce any new security issues other than 
   those defined in RFC 3036 and RFC 3212
