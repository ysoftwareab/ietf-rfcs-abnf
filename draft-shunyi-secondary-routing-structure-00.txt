Abstract

   This document introduces a dynamic secondary routing structure with
   the destination address and subnet mask as the first index and DSCP
   value as the second. DSCP values of various applications are
   extracted and packets are forwarded in accordance with them.
   Therefore, applications with different demands of Quality of Service
   (QoS) can be served accordingly, which can promote the quality of
   transmission and finally achieve differentiated services.

1. Introduction

   With the fast development of the Internet, management of the
   increasingly complex networks has drawn people's attention. Service
   differentiation provides scalability and stability, which can well
   adapt current heterogeneous network and fulfills distinct
   requirements of users. Traditional routing table is likely to cause
   traffic congestion and does not differentiate various types of
   services. Moreover, the Internet has a more sophisticated topology

   today, and its structure is varying all the time. A routing table
   with a fixed structure fails to meet the need of the changing network
   environment. This Internet draft gives a dynamic secondary index of
   routing structure based on DSCP value over traditional address-based
   routing table, which can well accommodate the changes of the Internet
   and provide better QoS guarantee.

2. Conventions used in this document

   Differentiated service (DiffServ) defines a structure which allows
   scalable services classification on the Internet. It can provide low
   latency and QoS guarantee for critical network traffic such as video
   and voice while provide best-effort guarantee for non-critical
   traffic such as file transfers. [RFC 2474]

3. DSCP Values of Differentiated Application

   The traditional Integrated Service doesn't provide scalability and
   stability which are essential to the development of the Internet.
   IETF proposed the Differentiated Service. In Differentiated Service,
   core router divides IP packets into different types in accordance
   with DS field of IP packet header, with no need to store the
   information of each flow. Each type of traffic has a corresponding
   PHB (Per Hop Behavior) [RFC 2597] and different demands of QoS.

   The DS field in IP packet header is defined as TOS value of IPv4
   packet header or six bytes of traffic class of IPv6 packet header
   [IPv6]. The DSCP value is a part of the DS field. It identifies the
   type of the traffic. When a packet arrives at a router, it is
   identified by the Traffic Identification module and is noted with a
   specific DSCP value as its application type. Then the router searches
   for the proper next hop from the routing table with this DSCP value
   [RFC 2475]. A two-bit Currently Unused (CU) field is reserved at
   present in its definition. In our previous document (draft-Shunyi-
   Unified-Traffic-00), the CU field is used as an extension of DS
   field. The DS field structure is presented below:

            0     1   2   3   4   5   6   7

           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

           |         DSCP          |  CU   |

           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

           DSCP: differentiated services codepoint

           CU: currently unused

   Part of the definition of different DSCP value is listed as follows:

   DSCP value    application type

   0x00         GRE
   0x04         SKYPE
   0x61         FTP
   0x6f         BitTorrent
   0x86         X11-TCP

4. Definition of the dynamic secondary routing structure

   The conventional routing table which contains destination address,
   subnet mask and next hop is likely to cause traffic congestion and
   does not provide differentiated services for various types of
   traffic. In this Internet draft we define a new dynamic secondary
   routing structure with destination address as the first index and
   DSCP value as the second one. In other words, each router keeps a
   table that records destination addresses and subnet masks in the
   first index, then for the same destination address, the router refers
   to the second index and finds its next hop in terms of the DSCP value
   of the packet which was marked when the packet reaches the router.
   The second index of the routing table is constructed dynamically. The
   structure of this routing table is as follows:

                 -------------------------------------------

   First index      | Destination Address | Subnet Mask |

                 -------------------------------------------

                 -------------------------------------------

   Second index     | DSCP Value | Next Hop |

                 -------------------------------------------

   It is well known that different types of traffic have different QoS
   demands. For example, if a flow is detected as online interactive
   traffic, like Skype, a route with low latency and jitter should be
   assigned to it, while traffic of simple text transmission has low QoS
   requirements. So properties like bandwidth, latency and jitter should
   be taken into consideration when forming the secondary routing table.

   It is clear that the first part of the routing table is a list of
   destination addresses and subnet masks of received packets, and the
   second index reflects the relation between DSCP value and next hop.
   Due to the fact that listing every DSCP value in second index may
   cause difficulty in storing and searching, we make a rough sort that
   combines some DSCP values and assign them with a same next hop. Note
   that the services with the same next hop should have similar QoS
   demands. The properties mentioned above should better not be
   considered independently, but we still divide the applications
   roughly into several classes for simplicity:

    (1) Traffic that demands a threshold for bandwidth
    (2) Traffic that demands lowest latency
    (3) Traffic that demands least jitter
    (4) Traffic that demands a shortest path

   Each router also keeps some information tables of its adjacent nodes
   including the bandwidth and the current payload of the link, latency
   and jitter of the link as well as the distance to other nodes in the
   network, which can help to choose the next hop. The information table
   is shown as follows.



   --------------------------------------------------------------

   | Adjacent nodes | bandwidth | payload | latency | jitter |

          B            ----        ---      ---        ---

          C            ----        ---      ---        ---

         ---

   --------------------------------------------------------------

                        Information table of node A

   This information is monitored and measured all the time and should be
   exchanged in a certain interval. When a packet is received, it should
   be classified first, then search for destination according to the
   secondary routing table. For example, when an application demands a
   lower limit of bandwidth, the router refers to the information table
   and finds a qualified link with the smallest bandwidth, and the node
   adjacent to it is selected as the next hop. Floyd Algorithm can be
   used to calculate the distances between any two nodes and form the

   routing table. If this application is classified as a traffic that
   demands a shortest path, Floyd Algorithm can be adopted.

   An example is shown next to explain how this routing table with
   secondary index works. Routers are denoted as letters such as D, B,
   E, etc.

                                                    0x42       B

                                                    0x4f       E

                                                    0x66       A

                                                    ---       ---

   |128.30.33.128       |255.255.255.128|-----|DSCP value |Next Hop|

                                                     0x09      H

                                                     ---      ---

   |128.30.36.0         |255.255.255.0|-------|DSCP value |Next Hop|

                                                     ---      ---

                                                     ---      ---

   When a router receives a packet, it extracts the destination address
   and subnet mask of the packet. Then it searches the second index of
   the routing table. First, it checks the types of services of this
   packet, and reflects it to one of the four types that we defined in
   advance. Second, the information table of this node is created and
   then the next hop can be determined. Once the next hop is selected,
   the packet will be forwarded.

   This dynamic routing table is especially applicable to the case that
   applications have the same source address and destination address.
   Because there can be many optional routes between two hosts in this
   situation. Thus different routes should be selected for applications

   with different demands. For example, a route with relatively high
   performance and good QoS guarantee can be provided for traffic that
   has high latency demand and is sensitive to jitter, while for
   services like simple file transfer, a route providing best-effort QoS
   guarantee can be preferable. Obviously, the second index of the
   routing table is constructed dynamically, which makes it possible to
   monitor and control the current state of the whole network. Thus
   network congestion can be avoided and better QoS can be guaranteed.

5. Security Considerations

   Noting the packets with different DSCP value and the definition of
   the new dynamic secondary routing structure do not have any direct
   impact on security.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.
