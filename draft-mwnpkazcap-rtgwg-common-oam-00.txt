 Rationale for Transport-independent Common Operations, Administration
                         and Maintenance (OAM)
                  draft-mwnpkazcap-rtgwg-common-oam-00


Abstract

   This document discusses set of Operations, Administration and
   Maintenance (OAM) tools that can be used as common OAM independent of
   specific encapsulation at server layer.  Requirements toward server
   layer to support common OAM are listed as well.

1.  Introduction

   The introduction and development of new service layers such as
   Service Function Chaining (SFC) and Bit-Ingress Explicit Replication
   (BIER), is driving the need for new Operations, Administration and
   Maintenance (OAM) tools.  This document discusses benefits of Common
   transport independent OAM solution to support components of network
   management framework known as Fault, Configuration, Accounting,
   Performance, and Security (FCAPS):

   o  Fault monitoring and defect localization;

   o  Performance measurement, both passive and active.

Internet-Draft                 Common OAM                   October 2015


1.1.  Conventions used in this document

1.1.1.  Terminology

   The term "OAM" used in this document interchangeably with longer
   version "set of OAM protocols, methods and tools for a particular
   layer".

   BIER: Bit-Ingress Explicit Replication

   FCAPS: Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security

   OAM: Operations, Administration and Maintenance

   SFC: Service Function Chaining

1.1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Use Case for Common OAM

   Recently several new service layers have been developed in IETF.
   Each of responsible groups, e.g.  SPRING, NVO3, SFC, BIER, have
   formulated a set of OAM requirements, specific to their respective
   layer [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-oam-requirement],
   [I-D.ashwood-nvo3-oam-requirements], [I-D.ietf-sfc-oam-framework],
   and [I-D.ietf-bier-oam-requirements].  Proposals have already been
   put forward to satisfy those requirements, though mostly by enhancing
   existing OAM tools, such as LSP Ping
   [I-D.kumarkini-mpls-spring-lsp-ping].  Enhancing existing tools
   certainly leads to faster deployment of OAM but may create
   operational issues later on.  For instance, these new service layers
   may be implemented a wide range of transport layers, e.g.  MPLS or
   IPv6, so OAM tools that are transport-oriented like LSP Ping would
   not be able to perform end-to-end for inter-domain scenario.

   At the same time, the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
   protocol is being successfully adopted for IPv6 and MPLS networks,
   and efforts are moving forward to define transport-independent OAM
   tool based only on the requirements of one of these new services,
   BIER.

   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-dt-encap] raised question of common OAM for NVO3,
   SFC, and BIER.  We want to take this further and:

Internet-Draft                 Common OAM                   October 2015


   o  analyze relevant OAM requirements and document common set of
      requirements towards OAM as well as requirements toward aservice
      layer to enable its ability to support OAM;

   o  analyze OAM solutions (proactive and on-demand CC/CV, PM, FM)
      being proposed and formulate approach to structure OAM tools that
      may be re-used across several types on encapsulation.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not propose any IANA consideration.  This section
   may be removed.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise any security concerns or issues in
   addition to ones common to networking.

   TBD
