      DNS Security (DNSSEC) DNSKEY Algorithm IANA Registry Updates
             draft-arends-dnsop-dnssec-algorithm-update-00

Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) require the use of cryptographic
   algorithm suites for generating digital signatures and cryptographic
   hashes over DNS data.  The algorithms specified for use with DNSSEC
   are reflected in IANA registries.  This document updates some entries
   in these registries.  The main reason for these updates is to retire
   the use of SHA1.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC, defined by
   [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC4509], [RFC5155], and [RFC5702])
   use digital signatures over DNS data to provide source authentication
   and integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses IANA registries to list codes
   for digital signature algorithms and hash functions.

   This document updates a set of entries in the IANA registries titled
   "DNS Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers" and "Delegation Signer (DS)
   Resource Record (RR) Type Digest Algorithms".

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The DNS Security Algorithm Implementation Status Lists

2.1.  Status Definitions

   Must Implement: The algorithm MUST be implemented to interoperate
   with other implementations of this specification.

Internet-Draft          DNSSEC Algorithm Updates              March 2017


   Must Not Implement: The algorithm MUST NOT be implemented.  An
   algorithm with this status has known weaknesses.

   Recommended to Implement: The algorithm SHOULD be implemented.
   Utility and interoperability with other implementations will be
   improved when an algorithm with this status is implemented, though
   there might be occasions where it is reasonable not to implement the
   algorithm.  An implementer must understand and weigh the full
   implications of choosing not to implement this particular algorithm.

   Optional: The algorithm MAY be implemented, but all implementations
   MUST be prepared to interoperate with implementations that do or do
   not implement this algorithm.

2.2.  Algorithm Implementation Status Assignment Rationale

   RSASHA1 had an implementation status of "Must Implement", consistent
   with [RFC4034].  The status of RSASHA1 is set to "Recommended to
   Implement" consistent with RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1.  The shift from "Must
   Implement" to "Recommended to Implement" is due to a perceived
   weakness in SHA1.

   The status of RSASHA256 is set to "Must Implement" as major
   deployments, such as the root zone [RZDPS], use these algorithms.  It
   is believed that RSA/SHA-256 or RSA/SHA-512 algorithms will replace
   older algorithms (e.g., RSA/SHA-1) that have a perceived weakness.

   All other algorithms used in DNSSEC specified without an
   implementation status are currently set to "Optional".

2.3.  DNSSEC Implementation Status Table

   The DNSSEC algorithm implementation status table is listed below.
   Only the algorithms already specified for use with DNSSEC at the time
   of writing are listed.

   +-----------+-----------+--------------------+----------------------+
   | Must      | Must Not  | Recommended        | Optional             |
   | Implement | Implement |                    |                      |
   +-----------+-----------+--------------------+----------------------+
   | RSASHA256 | RSAMD5    | RSASHA1            | Any registered       |
   |           |           |                    | algorithm not listed |
   |           |           |                    | in this table        |
   |           |           | RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 |                      |
   |           |           | RSASHA512          |                      |
   |           |           | ECDSAP256SHA256    |                      |
   |           |           | ECDSAP384SHA384    |                      |
   +-----------+-----------+--------------------+----------------------+

   This table does not list the Reserved values in the IANA registry
   table or the values for INDIRECT (252), PRIVATE (253), and PRIVATEOID
   (254).  These values may relate to more than one algorithm and are
   therefore up to the implementer's discretion.  As noted, any
   algorithm not listed in the table is "Optional".

2.4.  Specifying New Algorithms and Updating the Status of Existing
      Entries

   [RFC6014] establishes a parallel procedure for adding a registry
   entry for a new algorithm other than a standards track document.
   Because any algorithm not listed in the foregoing table is
   "Optional", algorithms entered into the registry using the [RFC6014]
   procedure are automatically "Optional".

   It has turned out to be useful for implementations to refer to a
   single document that specifies the implementation status of every
   algorithm.  Accordingly, when a new algorithm is to be registered
   with a status other than "Optional", this document shall be made
   obsolete by a new document that adds the new algorithm to the table
   in Section 2.3.  Similarly, if the status of any algorithm in the
   table in Section 2.3 changes, a new document shall make this document
   obsolete; that document shall include a replacement of the table in
   Section 2.3.  This way, the goal of having one authoritative document
   to specify all the status values is achieved.

   This document cannot be updated, only made obsolete and replaced by a
   successor document.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document lists the implementation status of cryptographic
   algorithms used with DNSSEC.  These algorithms are maintained in an
   IANA registry at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-
   numbers>.  Because this document establishes the implementation
   status of every algorithm, it has been listed as a reference for the
   registry itself.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document lists, and in some cases assigns, the implementation
   status of cryptographic algorithms used with DNSSEC.  It is not meant
   to be a discussion on algorithm superiority.

   Since the status of two algorithms have changed, it is important to
   consider the long term effect of these changes in implementations.

   An implementation may have provided a default algorithm to use when
   generating a DNSKEY.  An implementation may select a default
   algorithm to sign DNSSEC records.  It is recommended that
   implementations that provide a default algorithm use an algorithm
   with the status "Must Implement".
