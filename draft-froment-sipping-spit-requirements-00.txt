Internet-Draft   SPIT Authorization Policy Requirements        June 2007


Abstract

   Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is one of the foreseen future
   forms of spamming that SIP open-wide networks may have to handle.
   SPIT also has more impact on users than email spam since it is more
   intrusive.  Email as a store-and-forward communication mechanism
   allows for several filtering mechanisms to be applied to the full
   content before being presented to the user.  Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) interaction is, in contrast, real-time communication
   and therefore does not provide much information prior to the
   transmission of the content, making it both harder to filter and more
   annoying to users.  The responsibility for filtering, blocking calls,
   or taking any other preventive action can belong to different
   elements in the call flow and may depend on various factors.

   This document discusses the requirements to define authorization
   policies that should allow end users or other parties to setup anti-
   SPIT policies for triggering these actions.  These policies typically
   match a particular SIP communication pattern based on a number of
   attributes.  The range of attributes includes information provided,
   for example, by the SIP protocol itself, by the SIP identity
   mechanism, by information carried within SAML assertions, reputation
   systems of social networks and other extensions.

Internet-Draft   SPIT Authorization Policy Requirements        June 2007


1.  Introduction

   The problem of SPIT is an important challenge and it appears that a
   combination of several techniques is desirable to provide a framework
   to deal with it.

   One important building block is to provide a mechanism to instruct a
   trusted SIP proxy or any other SIP element to influence message
   handling of incoming requests according to policies.  Different
   entities, such as end users, parents on behalf of their kids or
   system administrators, might create and modify authorization
   policies.

   Some attributes in an incoming message play a more important role
   than others.  For example, applying authorization policies based on
   the authenticated identity, see [RFC4474], is an effective way to
   make decisions regarding unwanted traffic in many cases.

   This document identifies requirements for authorization policies when
   used to influence message handling for unwanted communicaion
   attempts.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119],
   with the important qualification that, unless otherwise stated, these
   terms apply to the design of the authorization policies, not its
   implementation or application.

   The term 'Rule Maker' is defined in RFC 3693 [RFC3693].

3.  Requirements

   This section lists the requirements categorized according to their
   applicability for the "conditions", "actions" and "transformation"
   parts of authorization policies.  Furthermore, we describe
   requirements that are more generic in nature and apply to the entire
   rule set.

3.1.  Conditions

   The first set of requirements refer to identity related information.

   Req-C 1:  Policies MUST allow conditions to express single
          authenticated identities.

   Req-C 2:  Policies MUST allow filtering based on the domain part of
          the identity.

   Req-C 3:  Policies MUST support the differentiation between
          authenticated and unauthenticated identities.

   Req-C 4:  Policies MUST be able to express expections within a group
          of users/domain.

   Message handling might be different depending on the content of the
   SIP message header fields.

   Req-C 5:  Policies SHOULD allow conditions to refer to the
          "destination" (which corresponds to the "Request-URI") and
          "original-destination" (which corresponds to the "To" header).

   Req-C 6:  Policies SHOULD allow conditions to refer to the method
          invoked by the caller (e.g., INVITE, REFER, MESSAGE).
          Motivation: Some SIP methods are more intrusive than others
          (the default applicative behaviour when SIP MESSAGEs are
          received is often to pop-up the message on the UAS side),
          adopting a different filtering policy depending of the method
          invoked will enhance the user's protection.

   Req-C 7:  Policies SHOULD allow Rule Makers to take actions on
          messages that are marked as Spam.

                 Note that such a condition element should be seen in
                 context of the authenticated domain or or otherwise
                 protected information to avoid security
                 vulnerabilities.

   [Editor's Note: Should we allow message handling based on the

   existence or non-existence of certain SDP / SIP content, such as
   specific mime types?  For example, is a "exists" test useful that
   returns true if the headers listed in the argument exist within the
   message.  Furthermore, do we need test operators (such as "allof" and
   "anyof", which implement logical "and" and logical "or",
   respectively)?

   Message handling might be different based on time.

   Req-C 7:  Policies SHOULD allow conditions that refer to the
          reception date, time or period of time of the incoming
          request.

   Message handling might be different based on the language.

   Req-C 8:  Policies SHOULD allow to make decisions based on the
          languages in which the originator of the call wishes to
          communicate.

   Message handling might be different based on the SIP resource
   priority fields, on emergency service related messages or more
   generic forms of indicating the type of service.

   Req-C 9:  Policies MAY allow to make decisions based on the presence
          of SIP Resouce Priority headers, as described in [RFC4412].

   Req-C 10:  Policies SHOULD allow to make decisions based on the
          messages marked as emergency calls indicated in
          [I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn].

   Req-C 11:  Policies MAY allow to make decisions based on service
          identification fields, see
          [I-D.rosenberg-sipping-service-identification].

3.2.  Actions

   Req-A 1:  Policies SHOULD allow messages to get "blocked", i.e., to
          stop forwarding the request and to return an answer with a
          ``403 Forbidden''

   Req-A 2:  Policies SHOULD allow messages to get "politely blocked",
          i.e., to drop the request without returning an answer.

   Req-A 2:  Policies SHOULD allow messages to get "marked", i.e., to
          forward the request and mark it as "potential Spam" for
          filtering at the end point or at subsequent entities along the
          signaling path.

Internet-Draft   SPIT Authorization Policy Requirements        June 2007


   Req-A 3:  Policies SHOULD allow messages to be "allowed", i.e., to
          forward this message.

   Req-A 4:  Policies MUST allow messages to be "redirected" to, for
          example, voicemail or to a different device in the possession
          of the user.

   Req-A 5:  Policies MUST allow the ability to execute other SPIT
          prevention procedures, such as computational puzzles
          [I-D.jennings-sip-hashcash] or the consent framework"
          [I-D.ietf-sip-consent-framework].  Ideally, a specification
          developing a SPIT prevention mechanism SHOULD provide
          information on how they can be incorporated into the
          authorization policy framework.

                 As an example, for a statistical analysis tool a URI is
                 defined.  The algorithms itself do not need to be
                 standardized and hence the impact for authorization
                 policies is mainly the ability to allow a Rule Maker to
                 enable or to disable the usage of these statistical
                 techniques for SPIT filtering and potentially to map
                 the output of the analysis process to value range from
                 0 (i.e., the message is not classified as Spam) and 100
                 (i.e., the message was classified as as Spam).  A Rule
                 Maker may decide the appropriate action on the message
                 depending on the determined SPIT probability.

   Req-A 6:  Policies MAY allow an e-mail (or SMS, MMS) to be sent to
          the user about the actions taken due to a specific call
          attempt.

3.3.  Transformations

   Req-T 1:  Policies SHOULD allow SIP messages to be marked with a
          certain SPIT probability in case SPIT detection and policy
          enforcement is excecuted on different entities.  For example,
          a network element might run a statistical SPIT detection tool
          but the authorization policies are executed on a different
          entity, such as the end host.  Note that it needs to be
          ensured that an adversary is not able to set the SPIT
          probabity values since otherwise the authorization policies
          that rely on such information are misguided.

3.4.  Generic Requirements

Internet-Draft   SPIT Authorization Policy Requirements        June 2007


   Req-G 1:  It SHOULD be possible to allow a hierarchy of authorization
          policies to be used.

   Req-G 2:  It MUST be possible for a client to learn the supported
          authorization policy capabilities implemented by the server.

   Req-G 3:  Policies MUST be extensible and these extensions MUST exist
          within a different namespace.  Furthermore, a published schema
          and the namespace for elements defined within it MUST NOT be
          altered by future specifications.

   Req-G 4:  The policies MUST provide a mandatory-to-implement conflict
          resolution mechanism.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.

Internet-Draft   SPIT Authorization Policy Requirements        June 2007


5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the requirements for elements contained in
   the authorization policies that allow communication attempts to be
   treated differently based on the content of the message, time-of-day,
   context of the user, reputation of the sending party, and many other
   factors.

   The security concerns are related to the ability of certain entities
   to create, update and delete authorization policies.  If an
   unauthorized entity is allowed to modify policies (and to distribute
   them to other domains) then a denial of service attack is the
   consequence with impact for more than a single end point.  These
   security aspects are, however, not subject of this document.
