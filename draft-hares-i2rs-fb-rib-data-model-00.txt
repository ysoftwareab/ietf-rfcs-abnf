                      Filter-Based RIB Data Model
                 draft-hares-i2rs-fb-rib-data-model-00

Abstract

   This document defines a data model for the I2RS Filter-based Routing
   Information Base (RIB) Yang data model.  A routing system uses the
   Filter-based RIBto program FIB entries that process incoming packets
   by matching on multiple fields within the packet and then performing
   a specified action on it.  The FB-RIB can also specify an action to
   forward the packet according to the FIB entries programmed using the
   RIBs of its routing instance.

1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS)
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] architecture provides dynamic read and
   write access to the information and state within the routing
   elements.  The I2RS client interacts with the I2RS agent in one or
   more network routing systems.

   This document provides a yang module for the I2RS filter Based
   Routing Information Base (FB-RIB) and describes the I2RS interaction
   with routing filters within a routing element.  The informational
   model for the FB-RIB is in [I-D.kini-i2rs-fb-rib-info-model]

1.1.  Definition of I2RS Filter Based RIB

   Filter-based routing is a technique used to make packet forwarding
   decisions based on a filter that is matched to the incoming packets
   and the specified action.  It should be noted that that this is
   distinct from the static routes in the RIB
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model] where the routing is destination
   ddress based.

   A Filter-Based RIB (Routing Information Base) is contained in a
   routing instance (defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model]).  It
   contains a list of filters (match-action conditions), a list of
   interface the filter-based forwarding operates on.  Filter-based RIBs
   (FB-RIBs) operate only on the interface the FB-RIB are configured on.

   A Filter Based RIB uses Event-Condition-Action policy.  A Filter-
   based RIB entry specifies matches on fields in a packet (which may
   include layer 2 fields, IP header fields, transport or application
   fields) or size of the packet or interface received on.  The matches
   are contained in an ordered list of filters which contain pairs of
   match condition-action (aka event-condition-action).

   If all matches fail, default action is to forward the packet using
   FIB entries that were programmed by the Routing Informational Base
   (RIB) manager described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model].

   Actions in the condition-action pair may impact forwarding or set
   something in the packet that will impact forwarding.  Policy actions
   are typically applied before applying QoS constraints since policy
   actions may override QoS constraint.

   The Filter-Based RIB resides in ephemeral state as does the I2RS RIB
   and I2RS topology models.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   FB-RIB

      Filter-Based Routing Information Base

   FB-Route

      The policy rules in the filter-based RIB are prescriptive of the
      Event-Condition-Action form which is often represented by if
      Condition then action".

   Policy Group

      Policy Groups are groups of policy rules.  The groups of policy in
      the basic network policy [I-D.hares-i2rs-bnp-info-model] allow
      grouping of policy by name.  This name allow easier management of
      customer-based or provider based filters.

   RIB IM

      RIB Informational Model (RIB IM) [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model]

   Routing instance

      A routing instance, in the context of the FB-FIB is a collection
      of RIBs, interfaces, and routing parameters.  A routing instance
      creates a logical slice of the router and allows different logical
      slices; across a set of routers; to communicate with each other.

6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.

7.  Security Considerations

   A I2RS RIB is ephemeral data store that will dyanamically change
   traffic paths set by the routing configuration.  An I2RS FB-RIB
   provides dynamic Event-Condition-Action policy that will further
   change the operation of forwarding by allow dyanmic policy and

   ephemeral RIBs to alter the traffic paths set by routing
   configuration.  Care must be taken in deployments to use the
   appropriate security and operational control to make use of the tools
   the I2RS RIB and I2RS FB-RIB provide.
