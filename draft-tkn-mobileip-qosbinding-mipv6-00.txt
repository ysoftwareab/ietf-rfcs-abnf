Abstract

   This draft presents a scheme for QoS support in Mobile IPv6 based on
   the architecture of Hierarchical Mobile IPv6.  A QoS option, a hop-
   by-hop header extension option first presented by Chaskar et al.
   [6], is carried in the message containing the Binding Update (BU)
   option to the mobility anchor point (MAP).  Each node between the

   mobile node (MN) and the switching MAP (including the MAP itself)
   which is concerned with managing QoS resources will forward the QoS
   requirement contained in the QoS option to its internal QoS
   mechanisms and check resource availability (essentially, performs
   admission control).  Depending on this check, it will either drop the
   message and send back a message carrying a negative acknowledgement
   to the MN, or forward the message (possibly after certain
   modifications to the QoS option) to the next hop.  Only when the QoS-
   conditionalized BU arrives at the MAP where old and new path meet
   (not necessarily the top-level MAP, but also potentially an
   intermediate MAP) and the check for resource availability in MAP is
   also successful, the MAP can make the final binding decision and
   reply with a BA.  Hence, handoffs are conditionalized upon the
   availability of sufficient resources oin the route between MN and MAP
   to meet QoS requirements.  When sufficient resources are not
   available and there is more than one new access router, the procedure
   can be reiterated.  By way of this scheme, local handoffs are managed
   locally, transparently to correspondent nodes (CNs) and proper QoS
   forwarding treatment is established in the new data path, while in
   the worst case (global mobility) it is managed with Mobile IPv6.  Our
   scheme is flexible (vertical handoff support and several levels of
   hierarchy can be used), scalable, and potentially supports
   interworking with multiple QoS mechanisms.

Internet-Draft    QoS-Conditionalized Binding Update in MIPv6  July 2001


1. Introduction

1.1 State of the art

   With the advent of various radio access technologies and increasing
   deployment of sophisticated applications in mobile end systems, IPv6-
   based networks will increasingly have to support Quality of Service
   (QoS) in mobile environments.  Mobile IPv6 ensures correct routing of
   packets to a mobile node when the mobile node changes its point of
   attachment with the IPv6 network.  However, it is also required to
   provide proper QoS forwarding treatment to the mobile node's packet
   streams at the changed route in the network due to node mobility in a
   fast, flexible, and scalable way, so that QoS-sensitive IP services
   can be supported over Mobile IPv6 [2].  A QoS scheme for Mobile IPv6
   should (i) be able to localize the QoS (re-) establishment to the
   affected parts of the packet path in the network, and (ii) in cases
   where more than one access technology or access router (AR) is
   available, it may be desirable for the MN to choose an appropriate AR
   that can satisfy its QoS requirements among several potential new ARs
   when the MN moves into such a region (especially since in vertical
   handoff scenarios, choosing a "good" access router might be more
   important than the mere speed of reestablishing a QoS path).  In
   these cases, a handoff should not be performed if the MN's QoS
   requirement is not met; yet if the QoS can be met, handoff should be
   performed as quickly as possible.

   In reference [6] a new IPv6 option called "QoS option" is introduced.
   One or more QoS objects are included as a hop-by-hop option in IPv6
   packets carrying Binding Update (BU) and Binding Acknowledgement (BA)
   messages.  When one packet for this purpose traverses different
   network domains in the end-to-end path, the QoS option is examined at
   these intermediate network domains to trigger QoS support for the
   MN's data packets.

1.2 Overview of our scheme

   The mechanism described in reference [6] outperforms RSVP [11][7] in
   that its signaling overhead is decreased.  However, it does not allow
   to check whether the QoS requirements are satisfied along the new
   route before performing the handoff.  We therefore introduce a QoS-
   conditionalized binding update.  The node at which old and new paths
   diverge ("switching router") makes the final decision whether or not
   to update the binding, depending on the result of QoS checks.  A
   binding update will only take place (in the sense of modifying the
   route) if all nodes along the route between the AR and the switching
   router are capable of complying with the QoS request, otherwise, the
   old route will still be used and a negative acknowledgement will be
   returned to the MN.

Internet-Draft    QoS-Conditionalized Binding Update in MIPv6  July 2001


   Our scheme is based on the architecture of Hierarchical Mobile IPv6
   (HMIPv6) [5] to localize the QoS-conditionalized bindings.  In
   HMIPv6, a new entity, the Mobility Anchor Point (MAP), is introduced
   and a MN only needs to perform one local BU through MAP when changing
   its layer 3 access point within the MAP domain.  HMIPv6 is not able
   to express QoS requirements, let alone to provide feedback regarding
   the success of such request.  We built on the work described in
   reference [6] to overcome these limitations.

   In our scheme, a QoS hop-by-hop option is carried in the message
   containing the BU option to the MAP - this message is called BU+QoS
   message.  Each node concerned with QoS management between the MN and
   the MAP (including the MAP) will pass the QoS requirement represented
   by the QoS option to internal QoS mechanisms and check its resource
   availability.  If resources are available locally, they are reserved
   and the message will be forwarded along its route.  If specified in
   the BU+QoS message, reservations covering less than the desired
   amount of resources are also be possible; the request in the BU+QoS
   message is then updated accordingly.  If resources are not available,
   negative feedback will be provided to the MN.  Upon receiving the
   BU+QoS message, the MAP also checks resource availability and, if
   successful, will update the binding status and respond with a
   positive BA+QoS message, including the actual amount of reserved
   resources, if different from the requested amount.  Otherwise, no
   binding update is performed and a negative BA+QoS message is returned
   to the MN.

   By way of this scheme, QoS (re-)establishment due to local handoffs
   is managed locally and transparently to the CNs, while in the worst
   case (global mobility) it is managed with Mobile IPv6 and [6].  Only
   if all routers along the new path find that sufficient resources are
   available will a handoff (switching from old to new path) take place.
   In this sense, the handoff process is conditional on the availability
   of QoS resources and our scheme can take advantage of HMIPv6.  The
   additional advantage, however, is that mobile terminals will only
   perform a handoff to an AR that can fulfill the QoS requirement (if
   there are multiple ARs to choose from; in case there is only a single
   AR able to serve the mobile terminal, even best-effort service would
   likely be acceptable, however, this is an application-level concern).

   The rest of this document provides a detailed description of the QoS-
   conditionalized binding update procedure(s) for Mobile IPv6.  The
   document is organized as follows:

2. Terminology

   This document uses the following terms in addition to those defined
   in the Mobile IPv6 protocol [4] and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 protocol
   [5]:

   QoS option: A Hop-by-Hop option introduced in reference [6].  A QoS
      option contains zero or more QoS objects in Type/Length/Value
      (TLV) format.

   QoS object: An object introduced in reference [6].  Essentially, QoS
      OBJECT is an extension of RSVP QoS and FILTER_SPEC objects, and
      contains certain parameters representing QoS requirements and
      traffic characteristics for a QoS flow.

   QoS entity: An entity responsible for QoS negotiation and
      establishment.  Examples are RSVP daemons in RSVP/IntServ, a
      Bandwidth Broker in a DiffServ domain, or a Label Edge Router in
      an MPLS domain.  From the perspective of MIPv6, QoS
      (re)establishment is treated transparently in QoS-capable routers
      or hosts; the IPv6 nodes MAY ask QoS entities to check the QoS
      requirements included in the QoS option, and afterwards the latter
      SHOULD perform such a reservation and respond with an
      acknowledgement possibly along with (possibly modified) QoS
      parameters.

   Switching router/MAP: The node at which old and new paths diverge

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

   Besides, the following acronyms and abbreviations are used in this
   document:

      MIP/MIPv6/HMIPv6: Mobile IP/Mobile IPv6/Hierarchical Mobile IPv6

      MAP: Mobility Anchor Point

      MN: Mobile Node

      CN: Correspondent Node

      QoS: Quality-of-Service

      CoA: Care-of-Address

      RCoA/LCoA: Regional/On-Link CoA

Internet-Draft    QoS-Conditionalized Binding Update in MIPv6  July 2001


3. Goals and assumptions

   The QoS-conditionalized binding update procedure for Mobile IPv6 is
   based on the following goals and assumptions:

   1.  We assume that most handoffs are local.  As a result, a QoS
       solution minimizing the time for QoS (re)establishment may take
       the advantage of the regional mobility solutions.  Furthermore,
       HMIPv6 model is assumed to be the regional mobility solution
       within our work.

   2.  In future wireless communication systems, it is likely that MNs
       can select among different ARs (possibly implementing different
       technologies or belonging to different administrative domains).
       There is hence a requirement of selecting among ARs when
       performing a handoff and that a handoff to a certain AR should
       only be performed if already established QoS guarantees can be
       maintained via the new AR.

   3.  The QoS entities in the route between (hierarchically the
       highest) MAP and MN are assumed to be capable of determining
       whether a given flow toward/from the MN can be admitted and, if
       so, are capable of (initiation of) reserving and releasing
       appropriate resources.  We do not define any traffic control and
       resource management solutions.

   4.  Any QoS (re-)negotiation beyond the highest-level MAP (between
       this MAP and other network domains) is an administration concern
       and out of our scope.  As we are mostly concerned with local
       mobility, end-to-end negotiation is not necessary and the QoS
       negotiation scheme described here therefore is only used in the
       part of the network between hierarchically highest MAP and MN;
       the usage of a range of different QoS mechanisms is conceivable
       here.

   5.  Support QoS-aware (vertical) handoffs over multiple access
       technologies collaborating on the IP layer.

   6.  QoS should is supported for both uplink (from MN) and downlink
       (to MN) traffic, provided that both uplink and downlink data
       travels along the same route.  (Otherwise, only uplink traffic
       can directly be supported, support for downlink traffic is this
       case is in principle feasible yet complicated).

   7.  Support the specification of both "Acceptable QoS" and "Desired
       QoS" if so desired by the MN.

   2.  Format of QoS Option - follows [6], except that 3 bits of
       "Reserved" bits are used to specify whether QoS requirement
       indicated by this option can be met, how to include acceptable
       and/or desired QoS and up- and/or downstream QoS.  (see Figure
       2):

       1.  If the "F" bit is set, this means "QoS can not be met",
           otherwise "(up to current node) QoS can be met".

       2.  If the "D" bit is set, this means "both upstream QoS and
           downstream QoS are specified separately", otherwise "upstream
           and downstream QoS are specified to be the same in both
           directions" (hence only one QoS object is required).
           Alternatively, the interpretation of a set "D" bit could be
           to indicate that only one direction (preferably downlink
           which is important e.g.  for streaming media) is specified.
           This is yet to be decided.

   Figure 3 - An Example of a QoS-Conditionalized Binding Procedure

   Figure 3 shows an example of a QoS-conditionalized binding update in
   a MAP domain.  In this figure, the MAP is the switching router, the
   AR and the MAP are the only nodes concerned with QoS control, and IRs
   are not shown.  In general, the path between the switching router and
   the AR may contain several MAPs, as well as DiffServ/MPLS domains
   and/or IntServ nodes, or combinations of both.  QoS entities in such
   nodes or domains should make admission control decisions based on the
   QoS option.  The QoS Option is a hop-by-hop header extension option
   and treated as described below.  (As an optimization, the new AR
   could obtain QoS information from the old AR via context transfer
   protocols in order to save wireless bandwidth - see discussion in
   Section 6.6.)

   In HMIPv6, outside the MAP domain, destination address or source
   address of any packet to and from MN is marked as the MAP's IP
   address or MN's RCoA in the MAP domain, not the HoA or LCoA of the

   MN.  Hence, the CN is oblivious of the BA, and a QoS (re-)
   establishment procedure due to handoff only happens inside the MAP
   domain.  here we only discuss the case of the basic mode of HMIPv6
   and the treatment in the extended mode of HMIPv6 needs more
   investigation.

   The QoS-conditionalized binding procedure works as follows.

   1.  MN gets a new LCoA and composes a message including a Binding
       Update option (where the so-called "A" bit is set to indicate
       that an acknowledgement should be generated once the binding
       update has taken place) and a QoS option.  The QoS option may
       contain up to four QoS objects: it may contain just one QoS
       object describing the least acceptable upstream QoS; or two QoS
       objects, additionally describing the desirable upstream QoS;
       further it may contain both aforementioned objects for the
       downstream direction.  This is discussed in detail in Section
       6.2.  Note it is possible (cf.  Section 4.1) to skip these last
       two objects by specifying upstream and downstream QoS as being
       identical.  The now composed message is called "BU+QoS".

   2.  MN sends the BU+QoS message to the new AR (towards the MAP).  (As
       stated above, the new AR could obtain QoS information from the
       old AR via context transfer protocols in order to save wireless
       bandwidth).

       *  IRs forward the BU+QoS message as a normal IPv6 packet.
          However, each router concerned with QoS control (IntServ node
          and ER) between the new AR and MAP (including the AR), before
          passing on the BU+QoS message, SHOULD check whether the "F"
          bit in the QoS option has been set by a previous router
          concerned with QoS control.  This can be the case if this
          previous router was unable to generate a BA+QoS message.

       *  If the "F" Bit has been set, it generates a BA+QoS message
          stating the reason for the fail (Status 131 in BA option -
          "insufficient resources"), and returns it to the MN, if it is
          capable of doing so.  Thereby no QoS object is returned.  If
          the node is incapable of generating BA+QoS messages, it just
          passes the message on to the next upstream router.  Unless the
          BA+QoS encounters a router capable of generating BAs, it
          continues up to the MAP.  The capabilities of routers
          regarding the interpretation of QoS objects, BAs and BUs are
          discussed in detail in Section 6.1.

       *  If the "F" Bit is not set, it inspects the QoS option,
          checking whether it (or the QoS domain) can provide this level
          of QoS by requesting it from the related QoS entity by, e.g.,

          asking a Bandwidth Broker of a DiffServ domain to setup the
          QoS (UP and/or DW).

          2.1 If yes, this amount of resources will be reserved, and the
             BU+QoS will be forwarded to the upstream router.

          2.2 If no, if the router is not able to provide the resources,
             its reaction depends on whether there is just one or two
             QoS objects.

             2.2.1 (a single QoS object is included in the QoS option):
                the "F" bit in the QoS option will be set.  Then the
                entity will either construct a negative BA+QoS (as
                described in 2) and return it to the MN if this node is
                capable to do so.  Or else (now the "F" bit in the QoS
                option is set) the BU+QoS will be forwarded to the next
                upstream router where (eventually) a negative BA+QoS
                message will be forwarded  to the next upstream
                router(at least a MAP must be capable of generating
                negative BA+QoS messages, other intermediate routers may
                pass on such messages to be handled upstream).

             2.2.2 (both desired and acceptable QoS object are included
                in the QoS option): if the router can provide at least
                the acceptable QoS, it can reserve whatever capacity it
                deems appropriate (at or above the acceptable level),
                write what it reserved in the "desired QoS" object, and
                then propagate the BU+QoS further upstream.  If not even
                the acceptable QoS can be provided, then this case is
                treated as 2.2.1.

   3.  The MAP will perform almost the same steps as in (2), except in
       (2.1) and (2.2.2).  In both cases, after the MAP was able to
       reserve resources (after possibly adapting them), it stores the
       MN's LCoA information in its Binding Cache (a binding update is
       performed) and generates a positive BA+QoS message, containing at
       most two QoS objects: "desired QoS", for both UP and DW, if
       available.  "Acceptable QoS" objects are dropped, since a
       positive BA means the acceptable QoS could be met.

   4.  IRs forward the BA+QoS message as a normal IPv6 packet.  However,
       if this is a router concerned with QoS control (IntServ node and
       ER) between the new AR and MAP (including the AR), it should
       inspect the QoS option:

       *  In case of a negative BA ("F" bit set, and Status 131 of BA
          option "insufficient resources"), release all resources
          reserved for this flow.  (Other possibilities how to handle



Festag, et. al.         Expires January 11, 2002               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft    QoS-Conditionalized Binding Update in MIPv6  July 2001


          such only semi-valid, intermediate reservations are discussed
          later in Section 6.5.)

       *  Otherwise, in case of a positive BA (no "F" bit set) check
          whether the QoS resources described are identical to those
          requested previously.  (If no QoS object is present, this
          means only "acceptable QoS" was specified, which remained
          unchanged, hence no reservation needs to be changed).  If the
          QoS resources have changed, change the reservation to adapt to
          this new QoS.  Then the BA+QoS is forwarded to the next
          downstream router.

       *  Note that these routers MUST NOT interpret these QoS options
          as request for new resources.  Rather, these QoS options are
          interpreted as providing more up-to-date information about a
          flow for which reservations have already been made.

   5.  Upon receiving the BA+QoS message, the MN should do the
       following:

       *  If the BU succeeds and the QoS requirement has been met, it
          starts QoS-guaranteed transmission.

       *  Otherwise, there are essentially three options:

          +  If there is another AR/LCoA available, initiate another
             BU+QoS message procedure, possibly with different QoS
             requirements, e.g., the desired level of QoS could be
             reduced.  There are several possibilities of how the number
             of available access routers could influence the setting of
             lowest acceptable QoS.  E.g., acceptable QoS could be a
             function of the number of available ARs and/or the MN's
             speed.

          +  If there is no other LCoA available, try again with this
             new AR, but reduce QoS requirements, possibly down to best-
             effort (it should have done so in the first place).

          +  Stay attached to the old AR if this is feasible
             (particularly in vertical handoff scenarios, a handoff is
             not necessarily time-critical and connectivity to an old AR
             can be maintained).

   Note that in order to correctly process the BA+QoS message, all
   routers concerned with QoS management, such as MAPs, ARs, and
   possibly DiffServ and MPLS ERs, as well as IntServ nodes need to
   maintain state for each flow.  However we believe this is not an
   additional burden to these entities as they need to maintain this



Festag, et. al.         Expires January 11, 2002               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft    QoS-Conditionalized Binding Update in MIPv6  July 2001


   same state anyways: MAPs must maintain the binding cache, and also
   the AR has to keep a information, including QoS information, for each
   MN.  DiffServ and MPLS ERs typically act as aggregation routers, i.e.
   they (as opposed to IRs) still know individual flows, just as do
   IntServ nodes.  Nevertheless, this constitutes an argument in favor
   of restricting QoS control to AR and MAP.

   Note also that the QoS reservation as well as Binding Update option
   may be maintained as soft state, where QoS option should be refreshed
   periodically.  The timer of QoS option may differ from that for the
   BU option and the procedure of refreshing QoS options needs further
   investigation.  One possibility would be to periodically resend a
   packet containing a QoS option with the level of QoS  that the MN has
   actually received.  An intermediate router would then have to check
   whether it already has a QoS reservation for a given flow.  If not,
   this would represent a new flow (and should potentially be
   accompanied by a BU option in the same packet, if this new flow has
   to do with mobility).  If information about the flow already exists,
   this QoS option is interpreted as a refresh message, similar to the
   way the QoS option in the BA message is interpreted.

   There are two alternative approaches for our scheme to release the
   QoS status in the old path if a handoff is successful.  One is
   timing-out, i.e., if no QoS option is received in a certain period of
   time, the correspondent QoS status in a QoS domain will be cleared.
   Another way is to release explicitly by sending a QoS option with "F"
   bit set along the old path towards the MN after a handoff is
   performed.  The selection of using which approach depends on their
   performance evaluation in different network scenarios and also needs
   further investigation.

5. Comparison of our scheme with the requirements draft

   In [2], a number of requirements are listed which a QoS solution for
   Mobile IP has to satisfy.  The following sections discuss how the
   conditionalized binding update presented in this draft compares with
   these requirements.

5.1 Performance requirements

   A QoS solution

   o  MUST minimize the interruption in QoS at the time of handoff - our
      scheme minimizes this interruption, because it provides the
      possibility to check for and reserve resources simultaneously with
      the binding update, and also allows for negotiating with several
      ARs to find one that can meet the QoS required.

   o  MUST localize the QoS (re)programming to the affected parts of the
      packet path in the network - satisfied with HMIPv6.

   o  MUST provide means to release any QoS state along the old path
      that is not required after handoff - one possibility is to let the
      MAP initiate the release request for the old path; the other is
      timing-out: as BUs time out, the QoS state along the old path will
      be released.


5.2 Interoperability requirements

   A QoS solution

   o  MUST be interoperable with other mobility protocols related to
      mobile IP.  This is an open issue, however, the scheme as such
      could be applicable to other mobility protocols as well.

   o  MUST be interoperable with heterogeneous QoS paradigms.  As
      discussed in  Section 4.2 above, our scheme interoperates with
      DiffServ, IntServ and MPLS.  Since its task is just carrying QoS
      information which is then used by QoS entities to do whatever the
      QoS paradigm requires, it should in fact interwork with any QoS
      paradigm.


5.3 Exception condition requirements

   A QoS solution

   o  MUST provide means to handle a situation in which the old QoS



Festag, et. al.         Expires January 11, 2002               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft    QoS-Conditionalized Binding Update in MIPv6  July 2001


      agreement cannot be supported after handoff - our scheme informs
      the MN the old QoS requirements cannot be met via a negative BA.
      The MN may initiate another BU with another AR or the same AR with
      lowered QoS requirements or stay attached to the old AR.


5.4 Miscellaneous requirements

   A QoS solution

   o  SHOULD be able to support QoS along different potential paths,
      such as route-optimized path between the MN and the CN, triangle
      route via HA, temporary tunnels between old and new access router.
      This is an open issue and requires additional investigation.

   o  MAY provide information to link layer to support required QoS,
      such as acceptable IP packet loss ratio for wireless link.  Not
      supported, extensions are conceivable.


5.5 Obvious requirements

   A QoS solution MUST satisfy

   o  scalability: the major scalability concern in this scheme is the
      need to maintain state in intermediate entities.  However, as most
      of the are MAP and hence must maintain binding update mappings,
      they do keep state on a per-flow level  anyway.  Hence, this
      scheme does not introduce any new scalability problems.

   o  security - see  Section 7

   o  conservation of wireless bandwidth - apart from obtaining a new
      LCoA address from a new basestation/access router, wireless
      bandwidth is used only to send BU+QoS and to receive BA+QoS.  It
      can, however, be decreased further by transferring context from
      old AR to new AR as described in [3] and as discussed later in
      Section 6.6

   o  low processing overhead on mobile terminals - MN need to insert
      QoS object into BU and must be able to interpret negative BAs (but
      compare discussion about the use of context transfer in Section
      6.6).

   o  hooks for authorization and accounting - needs further
      investigation

   o  robustness against failure of any MIP-specific QoS component in

      the network - since we use the QoS option in a context of HMIP, if
      (one) MAP fails, the QoS option will be delivered further without
      any treatment for QoS option (esp.  if a destination option for
      QoS option is used).  This needs further investigations.

Internet-Draft    QoS-Conditionalized Binding Update in MIPv6  July 2001


6. Further discussion

6.1 QoS control in entities unaware of the BU/BA options

   In our discussion, we distinguish two kinds of QoS-controlling
   entities.  Both of them are able to interpret the QoS object.  While
   one kind is capable of recognizing the BU/BA options in order to
   decide what kind of message arrived, and are also capable of
   generating (negative) BAs, the other kind of QoS-controlling entity
   do not know about BUs and BAs.  Such an entity bases its behavior
   only on the QoS option along with the QoS objects, but cannot use the
   BU/BA option to decide how to handle a message.  In particular, it
   must be able to distinguish a QoS option for a flow that has not yet
   established any reservations at this particular entity from a flow
   that already has a reservation.

   As described in detail in Section 4.2, our mechanism works correctly
   with both kinds of QoS-controlling entities.

6.2 Signaling downstream QoS requirements

   One concern is how to include QoS requirement for downstream traffic
   into a message carrying Binding options.  In an end-to-end signaling
   scenario, e.g., when using standard Mobile IP, the QoS information
   for the downstream traffic can easily be provided by the CN.  When
   using a hierarchical architecture, however, the downstream traffic
   information must still be available for the new path between the MAP
   and the MN.  Requesting this information from the CN would defeat the
   purpose of using hierarchical mobility schemes in the first place.
   On the other hand, making this information available in the router
   might be feasible with some QoS paradigms that provide per-flow QoS,
   yet QoS schemes that only work on aggregated traffic schemes should
   not burden intermediate nodes with maintaining information about
   individual traffic flows (rendering the entire idea of aggregate flow
   treatment useless) - and this information would have to be present in
   every router that would potentially be a MAP.

   Hence, the downstream QoS description cannot be obtained from the CN,
   neither can intermediate routers be expected to store this
   information for every flow.  Rather, the downstream traffic QoS
   requirements should be provided along with the upstream requirements
   in the BU+QoS message.  The MN could know this information (e.g.,
   from some application-level negotiation of QoS) but how to get it is
   out of the scope of this document.

   The main disadvantage of this approach is that the BU packets become
   larger.  While this should not pose much of a problem in the wired
   backbone network, it could be considered a serious drawback when the



Festag, et. al.         Expires January 11, 2002               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft    QoS-Conditionalized Binding Update in MIPv6  July 2001


   BU+QoS message has to be communicated over the wireless link.  There
   are some possible remedies to this problem which will be discussed
   later.

   Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the MN also specifies the
   downstream QoS requirements in the BU+QoS (the MN should be capable
   of providing this information, e.g., derived from application-level
   negotiation protocols).  While this does increase the amount of
   protocol data of the solution proposed here, the possibility to
   reduce state information in the network appears to be the outweighing
   concern - mechanisms like transferring context from old to new AR
   (e.g., [3], see discussions later) can additionally reduce wireless
   bandwidth requirements.  The treatment of up- and downstream QoS
   information in the routers directly follows [6].

6.3 Upgrading the level of QoS

   Another concern is which level of QoS requirements is appropriate for
   a MIPv6 QoS solution.  When the MN requests (in preparation of a
   handoff) a QoS along the new path that is larger than the one used on
   the old path, the switching router alone can no longer decide whether
   or not this request should be accepted (assuming that it would be
   possible to provide this level of QoS on the new path).  This
   inability is partly caused by the need to contact the CN to check
   whether it agrees as well, whether the CN's access network can
   provide such an increased capacity (otherwise, upgrading the MN's
   local reservation would make little sense), and it may also involve
   inter-domain QoS (re-)negotiation out of the (highest) MAP domain.
   Therefore, we suggest to consider during a handoff only the problem
   of maintaining the currently used QoS (and possibly specifying an
   acceptable lower limit) and to treat the problem of upgrading to
   higher service levels separately (the main points involved here would
   be authorization/charging, providing indication of the availability
   of more resources to the application, and application-level QoS
   renegotiation).

6.4 Possibility of changing from a hop-by-hop option to destination
    option

   The feature of hop-by-hop option for the QoS option obviously will be
   a drawback for a fast handoff.  Hence, a solution trying to use a
   destination option may be favorable.  If the AR is also a MAP, the MN
   may specify a destination for the QoS option (destined to the AR) and
   the AR may relay it as the destination option (destined to the next
   hop MAP) again, and so forth.  Then the QoS option can be carried as
   a destination option in the whole QoS-conditionalized binding
   procedure.




Festag, et. al.         Expires January 11, 2002               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft    QoS-Conditionalized Binding Update in MIPv6  July 2001


   Using such a destination option is straightforward if the MAPs are
   the only entities concerned with QoS control.  Typically, at least
   the AR would also perform QoS control without necessarily being a MAP
   as well.  An important case would be when the AR is the only QoS
   control entity besides the MAPs.  Here, the QoS option can be
   transmitted from the MN to the (switching) MAP in a hop-by-hop way,
   but it would be possible for the AR to change the QoS option from a
   hop-by-hop option to a destination option, destined to the next
   upstream  MAP.  Upon receiving this destination option and necessary
   work regarding QoS management, a MAP between AR and the highest MAP
   may encapsule the BU message again to destine it to the
   hierarchically next higher MAP.  When the highest MAP finally
   receives the BU+QoS message, it will issue a BA+QoS message and
   follow a reverse procedure (from destination option to a hop-by-hop
   option).

6.5 Handling intermediate reservations

   As the process of accepting a binding update is a distributed one in
   which several routers can participate, it is necessary to further
   specify in detail how this decision process should take place.
   Specifying such distributed processing is further complicated by the
   fact that multiple binding updates from different MNs could be
   processed at the same routers with only small temporal offset.

   The main issue is how a router handles a BU+QoS message that it could
   serve, but that also has to be passed upstream onto other routes in
   order to check whether they can also provide the requested QoS.  In
   general, this is a distributed commit problem and can be solved with
   well-known techniques, requiring a number of message exchanges e.g.,
   [9].  Here we are interested in faster approaches that should ideally
   work using only one round trip from MN to switching router and back;
   sacrificing some optimality aspects is unavoidable in such schemes.
   Two main schemes are conceivable: optimistic or postponed
   reservation.

6.5.1 Optimistic reservation

   An intermediate router considers the requested QoS as actually being
   reserved, optimistically assuming that all other routers along the
   way can also grant the request.  Reserving the capacity is the
   correct decision if all upstream routers can also grant the request.
   If any upstream router cannot comply with the request, a NACK is
   returned and the "lower" routers have to release the spuriously made
   reservation.  This optimistic reservation approach can be problematic
   if a lower router made a reservation that will later be denied and
   has had to reject other reservation requests that could have been
   granted upstream.

   However, if the round-trip time for BUs is short (which is reasonable
   in an access network using HMIPv6) and if there is less traffic
   (relative to the available capacity) towards the core than there is
   at the edges of the network, this situation should be rather
   improbable and might hence be regarded as an acceptable risk (in
   typical networks, the bottlenecks are likely to be closer to the edge
   than towards the core).

6.5.2 Postponed reservation

   In order to circumvent the problems of optimistic reservations, one
   possibility would be to postpone the actual reservation: when
   receiving a BU, a router only checks the instantaneous availability
   of resources, without actually reserving anything when forwarding the
   BU.  Actual reservation only takes place when positive
   acknowledgements are returned from upstream routers.

   The problem with such postponed reservations is that a BA+QoS might
   not be able to actually reserve capacity because of overlapping BU/BA
   messages from different MNs.  In such a case, the switching MAP has
   incorrectly reserved capacity and, even worse, performed a handoff to
   a path that is not QoS-guaranteed.  This is a rather serious
   drawback, and we hence propose to use an optimistic reservation
   scheme.

6.6 Handling large signaling packets over the wireless link

   At the beginning of an application, QoS information needs to be
   transported over the wireless link in order to enable end-to-end
   application-level negotiation of QoS requirements.  However, as both
   wireless communication capacity and processing power on mobile
   terminals are precious resources, once this QoS information has been
   established, it would be desirable to minimize the amount of QoS
   information traversing the wireless link and the amount of processing
   the MN has to perform.  A number of different approaches exist for
   this problem in general: compression schemes, moving protocol
   functionality away from MNs onto proxies that reside in the wired
   network; in the present context, context transfer schemes appear to
   be particularly useful [3].

   In particular, it should be feasible to assume that the old AR has
   the QoS requirement information for each of its MNs.  When an MN
   wishes to associate itself with a new AR, it could simply inform the
   new AR of the old AR's identity as well as of its own address
   (permanent and temporary address should work).  The new AR then
   fetches the QoS requirement description from the old AR and initiates
   the BU process on behalf of the MN; acknowledgements would still have
   to be provided eventually to the MN.

   Alternatively, the binding update process could also be initiated by
   the old AR.  Here, the MN (or even the new AR) becomes aware of a new
   address it wants to use.  The MN asks the old AR to initiate a
   binding update procedure for this new address.  The old AR contacts
   the corresponding new AR, providing  QoS requirements, and the new AR
   constructs a BU message to be sent in the usual fashion.  As soon as
   the BA arrives, the new AR informs the MN that the new address is no
   valid and that this new link should now be used.  Negative feedback
   should be provided via the old AR.  This scheme is particularly
   attractive if the MN is not capable of maintaining two different link
   layer bindings (i.e., communicate with both old and new AR
   simultaneously).

   Choosing between directly transmitting BU/QoS information and
   transferring context from another AR depends on a number of factors
   (delay, bandwidth and cost of both the wired and the wireless link
   and the respective weights assigned to them).  Additionally, applying
   context transfer is orthogonal to different ways of initiating the
   actual handoff (controlled by the MN, the old or the new AR).
   However, this question requires additional investigations.

7. Security considerations

   The QoS scheme described in this document raises the following
   threats, mainly concerning the integrity of BU/BA  and QoS options:

   o  An attacker might possibly try to forge or replay BU messages with
      specific QoS options in the name of another entity in order to
      either just harm that entity or to even gain economic benefits as
      QoS reservations may imply some form of billing consequences.

   o  An attacker might try to delay, delete, or modify passing BU+QoS
      messages (especially, the QoS options), e.g.  in order to reduce
      the desired QoS specification of another entity which might
      possibly affect its own QoS requests or the QoS requests of a
      third entity it wants to support in a positive manner.

   The above threats SHOULD be averted by protecting the integrity of
   BU+QoS messages with some kind of cryptographic signature, e.g.  as
   it is done with Mobile IP registration messages.  However, this
   requires the availability of appropriate key material in the signing
   and the checking entities.  It is out of the scope of this
   specification and for further study if this can be realized with a
   hop-by-hop approach, that is every intermediate node that processes
   BU+QoS messages or just the QoS options checks their integrity and
   signs the outgoing BU+QoS / QoS options, or an end-to-end approach
   which could, for example, require the last MAP to check the integrity
   of the mobile node's original BU+QoS message and its QoS option(s).
