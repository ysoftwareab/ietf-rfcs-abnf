Abstract

   Routing is essential to a network.  Routing scalability is essential
   to a large network.  When routing does not scale, there is a direct
   impact on the stability and performance of a network.  Therefore,
   routing scalability is an important issue, especially for a large
   network.  This document identifies major factors affecting routing
   scalability as well as basic principles of designing scalable routing
   for large networks.

1. Introduction

   Routing is essential to a network. Without routing, packets cannot be
   delivered to desired destinations and the network would be non-
   functional. The challenge of designing routing for a large network,
   such as a large ISP backbone network, is not only to make it work but
   also to make it scale. Without a scalable routing system, a network
   may suffer from severe performance penalty as unfortunately proven by
   disastrous events in large networks. This document attempts to
   analyze routing scalability issues and define a set of principles for
   designing scalable routing system for large networks.

   The organization of this document is as follows: Section 2 describes
   routing functions and design goals. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the
   characteristics of today's large networks and the associated routing
   scaling issues. Section 5 explores routing protocol scalability, and
   Section 6 presents scalable routing design principles. Section 7
   provides a conclusion to the document.

2. Common Routing Design Goals

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles           [Page 2]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   The basic goals a routing system should achieve are as follows:

      o Stability
      o Redundancy and robustness
      o Reasonable convergency time
      o Routing information integrity
      o Sensible and manageable routing policy

   The challenge of designing routing in a large network is not only to
   achieve these basic goals but also to make the routing system scale.

3. Characteristics of Today's Large Networks

   Today's large networks typically possess the following features:

      o They are composed of a large number of nodes (routers and/or
      switches), typically in the hundreds. Some provider networks
      include customer CPE routers within their administrative domain,
      which increases the number of nodes to thousands.

      o They have rich connectivity to meet redundancy and robustness
      requirements, and they consequently have complex topologies.

      o They are default-free; that is, they carry all the routes known
      to the entire Internet. Currently, the total number is
      approximately 60,000.

      o The customer aggregation routers sometimes connect hundreds of
      customer routers.

   These characteristics impose direct challenge to the routing
   scalability of the network.

4. Routing Scaling Issues

   Today, the main issues surrounding routing scaling are excessive
   router resource consumption which can potentially destabilize a
   network; and routing complexity resulting poor management of network
   thus low service quality.

4.1. Router Resource Consumption

   The routing process puts bursty loads on routers, especially under
   unstable network conditions. In the extreme case, the routing process
   takes all available resources from the routers, which results in slow
   routing convergence or no convergence. A network is paralyzed when it
   cannot converge internal routing information.

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles           [Page 3]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   It's worthy noting that routers with architecture that tightly couple
   forwarding and routing process tend to handle the excessive routing
   load poorly. Emerging new generation of routers separate resource
   used for forwarding and routing are in the hope of scaling better.

   Today, a large network typically employs IS-IS[1,2] or OSPF[3] as
   Interior Routing Protocol(IGP) and BGP[4] as Exterior Routing
   Protocol (EGP). IGP is responsible for routing information with
   regarding to routers within the network. BGP facilitates routing
   exchange between routing domains, or Autonomous Systems(AS). BGP
   processes and propagates external routing information within the
   network. Large number of routers and adjacencies in a network coupled
   with frequent topology changes due to link instability would
   contribute to excessive router resource consumption in the case of
   interior routing. In the case of exterior routing, large quantity of
   routers in a BGP system plus frequent routing updates (route
   flapping) would put heavy burden on the routers. Section 5 describes
   scaling issues with IS-IS, OSPF and BGP in detail.

   In addition, many routes in a routing system combined with multiple
   paths associated with these routes impose the following scaling
   issues on BGP:

      o Large number of routes combined with multiple paths for each
      increase the cost of routing processing for route selection,
      routing policy application and filtering.

      o Too many routes combined with multiple paths require large
      amounts of memory on routers for storage. The demand is even
      higher at InterExchange Points such as NAPs.

      o The large the number of routes, the greater the chance route
      flapping will occur and the more BGP routing updates will happen
      as a result. Based on statistics collected by [5], thousands of
      BGP updates in a measured 15 minute interval can occur on a
      typical default-free router at a NAP.

      Route flapping refers to high frequent routing updates occurring
      due to network instability, for example, when the state of a
      physical link in the network is fluctuating, or when a BGP session
      is torn down and re-established numerous time within a short
      period.

      To facilitate fast convergence, topology change information must
      be propagated in a timely fashion. When a route becomes
      unavailable and is withdrawn, the information is typically sent
      immediately. If the affected routes have been announced to the
      global Internet, the update information is likely to be propagated

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles           [Page 4]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

      to the entire Internet.

      Route flapping has profound impact on routers running BGP. The
      routers have to processing routing information frequently and this
      consumes tremendous resources. When a local route or link is
      oscillating, interior routing is affected as well by excessive
      topology information flooding and shortest path calculations.
      However, OSPF (or IS-IS) imposes rate limits on such activity to
      reduce the burden on the routers. For example, OSPF specifies that
      an individual SLA can be updated at most once every 5 seconds.
      This essentially dampens the flapping.

   Moreover, large numbers of E-BGP sessions processed by a single
   router create another potential scaling issue. Large networks usually
   have huge customer subscriptions and connections. To scale the
   hardware and the number of nodes in the network, providers tend to
   dedicate a group of customer aggregation routers, each connecting as
   many customer CPE routers as possible. As a result, it's not uncommon
   that a customer aggregation router handles hundreds of E-BGP
   sessions, which imposes potential problems such as BGP session
   processing and maintenance, route processing, filtering and route
   storage.

4.2. Routing Complexity

   Routing complexity can lead to network management difficulties, which
   will have impact on trouble shooting and quick problem resolution. It
   can result in less than desirable service quality across the network.
   Complicated routing policies and special cases or exceptions in a
   routing design can contribute to routing complexity in a large
   system.

   Routing Policy refers to the administrative criteria for handling
   routing information, commonly in the form of routing path selection
   and route filtering.  The way routing information is handled has
   direct impact on traffic flow within a network and across domains. As
   a result, it affects business agreements among different networks.
   Therefore, the determination of routing policy is largely dominated
   by non-technical concerns such as business considerations. Routing
   policy can be very complex, which would make management and
   configuration an unscalable task.

   The keys to reducing routing complexity are systematic as well as
   consistent routing scheme and routing policy that is simple but meets
   the requirement of administrative polices.

   Another factor contributing to the complexity of routing management
   is prefix- based route filtering. As is well known, prefix-based

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles           [Page 5]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   filtering is necessary in order to protect the integrity of the
   routing system. This becomes a challenge when the number of routes
   known to the Internet is as large as about 60,000 today.

5. Routing Protocol Scalability

   Today's commonly deployed routing protocols are IS-IS or OSPF for
   Interior routing (aks IGP) and BGP for exterior routing (aka EGP). In
   terms of scaling and other aspects, these protocols are already an
   improvement over previous generation protocols, such as RIP and EGP.
   However, scalability is still a major issue when a network is large,
   when a routing design is insensitive to scaling issues, or the
   protocol implementation is inefficient.

5.1. IS-IS and OSPF

   As described earlier in the document, IS-IS and OSPF are Link State
   routing protocols. The basic components of a link state routing
   protocol are generation and maintenance of a Link-State-DataBase
   (LSDB) that describes routing topology of a given routing area and
   route calculation based on the topology information in the database.
   Each node in a routing area is responsible for describing its local
   routing topology in a Link State Advertisement or LSA (LSP in the
   case of IS-IS.) Each individually generated LSA will be distributed
   or flooded to all the routers in the area. Each router receives LSAs
   from all the other routers forming a link-state-database that
   reflects the routing topology of the entire routing area.

   The main associated scaling issues are the complexity of link state
   flooding and routing calculation.  In addition, the size of LSDB
   which contributes to the cost of routing calculation and router
   memory consumption.

   Flooding is a process for a router to distribute its self-originated
   LSA to the rest of the routers in the area in case of any link state
   change. A router will send the LSA via all its interfaces. When
   receiving an LSA update, a router validates the information and
   updates its local LSDB before sending it out via all its own
   interfaces except the one from which it received the original LSA
   update. Given the nature of IS-IS or OSPF flooding, a full-mesh
   network with N routers would have O(N^2) of LSAs flooded in the
   network when a single link failure occur. A single router outage
   would cause LSA in the order of O(N^3) flooded in the system.

   In the case of OSPF, the protocol will refresh or flood every 30
   minutes even under stable conditions, it could magnify an already
   highly loaded routers.

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles           [Page 6]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   From the above discussion, one can easily observe the more routers
   and adjacencies in a Link State IGP routing area and adjacency, the
   more CPU burden each router needs to bear. When a network is
   unstable, the load will be amplified.

   A link-state protocol typically uses Dijkstra's Shortest Path First
   (SPF) algorithm for route calculation. The Dijkstra algorithm scales
   to the order of O(N^2) where N is the number of the nodes. The
   algorithm could be improved to the order of O(l*logN) where l is the
   number of links in the network and N is the number of destinations or
   routers [6].

   Consequently, link state routing protocols do not scale to a network
   topology with many routers and excessive adjacencies in an area. When
   the network topology is unstable, the computation, processing and
   bandwidth cost are magnified, which causes excessive consumption of
   route resources. When the instability prevents IS-IS or OSPF from
   maintaining adjacencies, network routing meltdown occurs.

   Node adjacencies are discovered and maintained through the exchange
   of HELLO messages sent periodically from each node. When a node fails
   to receive HELLO messages from its neighbor within a certain period
   of time (40 seconds for OSPF and less for IS-IS), it considers the
   neighbor down. When heavy flooding, re-calculation and other
   activities happen that make router CPU a scarce resource, a router
   may not be able to allocate CPU time to send or process HELLO
   packets. Routers in the network then lose adjacency, which magnifies
   the instability. As a result, an isolated instability can escalate to
   routing failure across the entire network.

   Link-state IGP also does not scale well to carry large number of
   routes such as the 60,000 routes known to the Internet today. Since
   external routes are included in link-state-database and in LSA (LSP
   for IS-IS) updates, the link bandwidth and router memory consumption
   will be tremendous. Moreover, due to the large size of LSA updates,
   it'd aggravate router resource consumption in the process of LSA
   flooding especially under unstable network condition.

   To summarize, a scalable design should avoid inclusion of too many
   routers in an IGP routing area, too many external routes carried by
   IGP and, more important, excessive adjacency in the area.

5.2. BGP

   BGP is an inter-domain routing protocol allowing the exchange of
   routing or reachability information between different autonomous-
   system networks. Functionally, BGP is composed of External BGP (E-
   BGP) and Internal BGP (I-BGP).  E-BGP is used for exchanging external

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles           [Page 7]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   routes while I-BGP is typically used for distributing externally
   learned routes within an AS.

   The general cost of BGP are as follows:

      o CPU consumption in BGP session establishment, route selection,
      routing information processing, and handling of routing updates

      o Router memory to install routes and multiple paths associated
      with the routes.

   The major scaling issue associated with BGP lies in the full mesh I-
   BGP connections. Since it does not scale for IGP to carry externally
   learned prefixes as mentioned in the previous section, I-BGP assumes
   this duty. In order to prevent routing loops, prefixes learned via
   I-BGP are prohibited from being advertised to another I-BGP speaker.
   As a result, full mesh of I-BGP sessions among the routers within an
   AS is required. In an AS with N routers, each router will have to
   establish I-BGP sessions with N-1 routers, and the system complexity
   is in the order of O(N^2). Therefore, BGP scales poorly when the
   number of routers involved in I-BGP mesh is large.

   A large network normally learns all the routes known to the Internet,
   which is approximately 60,000. I-BGP will need to carry all these
   routes.

   The large number of I-BGP sessions and routes consumes tremendous
   resources from each router, especially during BGP session
   establishment and during periods of heavy route flapping.

   Frequent routing update is another potential scaling problem in large
   networks.  BGP uses incremental updates and sends out routing
   information about unreachable routes quickly to reduce convergence
   time. This is a great improvement from EGP, in which the whole
   routing table is updated at a fixed time interval. However, when a
   network is unstable, for example, under route flapping, or BGP
   session oscillation, the updates, especially those containing route
   withdrawals, are sent immediately, causing global BGP updates. As a
   result, network instability initiated anywhere in a network triggers
   updates all over the Internet. This effect is magnified when large
   amount of routes are visible to the Internet, putting a heavy load on
   routers that participate in BGP.

   The introduction of a routing hierarchy in BGP, through I-BGP Route
   Reflector [7] and BGP Confederations [8], for example, will help
   alleviate the scaling problem caused by the requirement of full mesh
   I-BGP establishment.

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles           [Page 8]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   Another potential solution is to avoid the requirement of full mesh
   pairwise I-BGP connections. This will change the way that BGP
   distributes routing information among the I-BGP peers. Mechanisms
   worth considering are using multicast to distribute information or
   adopting flooding mechanisms similar to those used in IS-IS or OSPF.

   Route dampening [9] is one way to reduce excessive updates triggered
   by route flapping. The Trade-off between fast convergence and
   stability of the network should be considered as discussed in section
   6.3.

6. Scalable Routing Design Principles

   Routing design for a large-scale network should achieve the basic
   goals of accuracy, stability, redundancy and convergence as described
   in Section 2 and more over achieving it in a scalable fashion.

   How routing scales is influenced by protocol design decisions,
   protocol implementation decisions, and network design decisions. A
   network engineer has direct control over network design decisions and
   can have substantial influence over protocol design and
   implementation. The focus of this document is network design
   decisions.

   Following is a set of design principles for making a large network
   routing system more scalable:

      o Building Hierarchy
      o Compartmentalization
      o Making proper trade-offs
      o Reducing routing process burdens
      o Defining scalable routing policies and implementation
      o Utilizing out-of-band routing assistance

6.1. Building Hierarchy

   As discussed in Section 5.1, OSPF and IS-IS scales poorly when a
   network has large number of routers and especially large quantity of
   adjacencies. This has unfortunately been proven by networks that
   deploy IP over ATM with full mesh adjacencies among the routers. The
   full mesh overlay design combined with the inefficient protocol
   implementation had led to disastrous network outages. A lesson
   learned from this is to avoid full mesh overlay topology in a large
   network with a large, flat network routing structure.

   Building hierarchical routing structures in the network is the key to
   achieving routing scalability in a large network. As discussed
   earlier in this document, large networks is usually composed of many

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles           [Page 9]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   routers with a complexed topology, which result in large amount of
   adjacencies. As also discussed earlier, the currently available
   routing protocols scale poorly for handling a large number of routers
   in a routing domain or many adjacencies among the routers. Therefore,
   it is sensible to build a routing hierarchy to reduce the number of
   routers as well as the number of adjacencies in a routing domain.

   The current common practice is to build a two-tiered hierarchy in a
   network with a center component (or transit core network) attached by
   a number of outlying components (or access networks). The transit
   core network covers the entire geographical area the network serves;
   each access network (aks regional network) covers one region. There
   are usually no direct link connections among the regional components.
   Traffic from one regional network to another traverses the transit
   core. Customer networks connect only to access or regional networks.
   There are a number of ways to build a routing hierarchy to the above
   described hierarchical network topology.

      1. Completely Separate Routing Domains

      This design treats the transit core network and each regional
      network as completely independent ASs with respect to routing, and
      each AS runs an independent IGP. Each regional network E-BGP with
      the transit core for exchanging routing knowledge. Full I-BGP
      connection needs to be established only within each component
      network. With this design, the maximum number of routers in an IGP
      domain is the total number of routers in each component. As a
      result, the IGP processing load is reduced, and the number of
      routers in an I-BGP mesh in the network routing system is
      decreased dramatically.

      Another advantage of this design is that it compartmentalizes the
      routing system so that instability in one of such components has
      less impact to the entire system. See the discussion in section
      6.2.

      The main disadvantage of this scheme is that it inserts one extra
      AS in the routing path when routes are advertised to the Internet
      via BGP. This extra AS in the path may cause route selection
      difficulties for other providers.

      2. One Domain with IGP and BGP Hierarchy

      This method includes the transit core and each regional network
      into one AS domain. The routing hierarchy is realized using
      multi-area IS-IS or OSPF and either BGP Confederation or I-BGP
      Reflector or a combination of the two.

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles          [Page 10]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

      This mechanism avoids the introduction of an extra AS in the
      routing path, which is an advantage over the method described in
      Point 1.  However, multi- area hierarchical IGP is rarely used
      now-a-days in large networks since most of them are using IS-IS
      for internal routing, which does not have sufficient multi-level
      support. Although IS-IS supports multi-area routing, it imposes a
      strict hierarchy between backbone and sub-areas and allows only
      the advertisement of a default route from the backbone area to the
      sub-areas instead of specific prefixes. This restriction may be
      suitable for a network with simple sub-area topology. A sub-area
      in a large network, typically a regional or access network, itself
      has complicated topology. Receiving highly abstract routing
      information, such as a default route, would affect the sub-area's
      ability to make route selections required for traffic engineering.
      It would also limit the information passed to external ASs, for
      example, IGP-derived BGP Multi-Exit-Discriminator (MED)
      information.

      3. One IGP Area with BGP Hierarchy

      In lieu of multi-area IS-IS, the routing hierarchy could be
      achieved by defining one IGP domain for the entire network while
      employing BGP hierarchy. Fortunately, the hierarchical topology of
      the network in this case helps reduce adjacencies in the routing
      domain (recall there are no connections among the second-level
      network components). In addition, improvements could be made to
      further reduce the adjacency by carefully arranging the
      adjacencies to keep them at minimum but still achieve good
      redundancy. However, this is less than ideal since the number of
      routers remains unchanged, which increases the load on SPF
      calculation. Moreover, instability within any regional network
      would still affect the entire network (that is, there would be no
      fault isolation).

      Even with one IGP domain, it is possible to build BGP hierarchy to
      make I-BGP more scalable in the network. BGP Reflector and BGP
      Confederation are existing mechanisms to address the scaling
      problem of full-mesh I-BGP.

      Further, BGP reflector provides the ability to build more than two
      levels of hierarchy, as long as the interaction among the
      different levels of the hierarchy are carefully arranged to avoid
      the possibility of creating routing loops.

   Questions worth asking are: "Are two levels of routing hierarchy
   enough for addressing scaling issues?" "Is there really a need for
   more than two levels of hierarchy?"

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles          [Page 11]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   When a second-tiered sub-domain, such as a regional network, grows
   too big for routing protocols to handle, either another layer of
   hierarchy needs to be introduced or the sub-domain needs to be split
   into multiple second-tiered sub-domains.

   Keeping two levels of hierarchy and adding more sub-domains appears
   to be more manageable than adding another level to the hierarchy.
   However, one precaution is to avoid adding more nodes to top-level or
   the transit core network to make it less scalable. Connecting the
   split sub-areas to the same core router would eliminate the need to
   add more nodes in the core area than is recommended.

   Having more than two levels of hierarchy would exceed the capability
   of IGPs as they are defined today. In OSPF, for example, all the
   areas must be connected via the backbone area, which eliminates the
   possibility of having more than two levels of hierarchy. IS-IS has
   the same limitation. Therefore, the specific area of the protocols
   needs to be redefined should more than two hierarchical layers in IGP
   be desirable. There is work in progress to build multi-layer IS-IS
   for more than two levels of hierarchy.

   The complexity of protocol and management will increase with the
   number of levels added to the hierarchy. According to [6], most of
   the OSPF protocol bugs found over the years are related to routing
   area support. Because the interaction among the multiple levels
   increases management and debugging complexity, it is desirable to
   keep the levels within a hierarchy to the minimum.

6.2. Compartmentalization

   A scalable routing design of a large network should be able to
   localize problems or failures thus preventing them from spreading to
   the entire network consuming resource of network routers and causing
   network wide instability. This is compartmentalization.

   To achieve compartmentalization in routing design for a large
   network, one needs to avoid the design of involving the whole large
   network as one flat routing system or routing domain. This is the
   reason for the architecture of dividing interior and exterior routing
   in the global routing system. Within a network, it is best to divide
   the network into multiple routing domains or multiple routing areas.
   For example, in OSPF, only summary route SLAs, rather than individual
   area routes, are flooded beyond the area. When an area border routers
   aggregates the routes in its sub-area, instability of any route
   included in the summary route would not cause flooding of SLAs to
   other areas. As a result, router resources in other areas would not
   be consumed for handling flooding and SPF recalculation. In other
   words, instability within an area would be prevented from spreading

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles          [Page 12]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   to the entire routing domain.

   Since building routing hierarchy essentially divides a big routing
   area into smaller areas or domains, it helps achieving the goal of
   compartmentalization.

6.3. Making Proper Trade-offs

   When designing routing for a large network, the overall goal should
   be set with considerations of routing scalability and stability. The
   trade-offs between conflicting goals shall be taken into account.
   Examples of such trade-offs are redundancy vs. scalability and
   convergence vs. stability.

   Redundancy introduces complexity and increased adjacencies to the
   network topology. Redundancy also imposes the need for as many
   alternative paths as possible for each route, which increases route
   processing and storage burdens.  Because of these problems, it may be
   necessary to sacrifice absolute redundancy in favor of a reasonable
   level that scales better to the routing system.

   Fast convergence requires that changes in network topology be
   propagated to the network as quickly as possible. This increases
   routing updates and, consequently, the route processing burden. The
   burden is aggravated when a network carries full Internet routing
   information, as large networks usually do and topology changes happen
   frequently. Route dampening may be necessary to achieve stability at
   the expense of absolute fast convergence.

6.4. Reduce Burdens of Routing Information Process

   The tasks of reducing routing process burdens includes strategically
   place the routing intelligence within the network, avoid carrying
   unnecessary routing information and reduce the impact of route
   flapping.

6.4.1. Routing Intelligence Placement

   A router that executes routing policies, performs route filtering and
   dampening posses routing intelligence. Routing intelligence is needed
   for a network 1) to enforce the business agreement between network
   entities in the form of routing policies; 2) to protect integrity of
   the routing information within the network and sometimes and 3) to
   shield a network from instability happening elsewhere in the
   Internet.

   The more routing intelligence a router has, the more resources of the
   router are needed for related tasks. It is logical, then, to place as

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles          [Page 13]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   little routing intelligence as possible on routers that already are
   heavily burdened with forwarding and switching tasks.

   Usually, traffic is heavily concentrated in the core of the network.
   Because traffic aggregates from the edge of the network toward the
   core, traffic is less concentrated near the edge of the network.
   Consequently, to build a scalable routing system, it is wise to place
   routing intelligence at the edge of the network, especially routers
   that are not sufficiently decouple forwarding and routing are
   deployed in the network. In addition, pushing routing intelligency as
   close to the edge of the network as possible also serves the purpose
   of distributing computational and configuration burdens on all
   routers.

   It is also desirable to move the heavy burden of processing routes to
   out-of- band processors, freeing more resources in network routers
   for packet forwarding and handling.

6.4.2. Reduce Routes and Routing Information

   As discussed in Section 4.1, a large number of routes in the system
   is one of the major culprits in route scaling problems. It is best to
   reduce the routes in the system without losing necessary routing
   information.

6.4.2.1. CIDR and Route Aggregation

   CIDR as specified in [10] provides a mechanism to aggregate routes to
   efficiently utilize IP address space as well as reduce the number of
   routes in the global routing table. CIDR offers a way to summarize
   routing information, which is one of the keys for routing scalability
   in today's Internet.

   Aggregating routes would not only help global Internet scalability
   but would also contribute to scalability in local networks. The
   overall goal is to keep the routes in the backbone to a minimum.

   To achieve better aggregation within the network; that is, to reduce
   routes in the network, a block of consecutive IP addresses should be
   allocated to each access or regional network so that when a regional
   network announces its routes to the transit core network, they can be
   aggregated. This way, the core and other regional networks would not
   need to know the specific prefixes of any particular access network.
   Although assignment of customer addresses from a provider block would
   have to be planned to support aggregation, the effort would be
   worthwhile.

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles          [Page 14]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

6.4.2.2. Utilize Default Routing where it's Possible

   Using of default route achieves ultimate route summerization which
   reduces routing information to minimum. Route summerization also
   masks the instability associated with individual route such as route
   flapping. It's beneficial for a network to utilize default routing
   where it fits. For example, if a second- tiered regional network is a
   stub and there is no connected customer requesting full Internet
   routing information, the regional network can simply point default to
   its connected core network. However, over summerization of routing
   information has the danger of loosing routing granularity and as a
   result, management of network such as traffic engineering would be
   tempered. Therefore, Cautions need to be exercised when using default
   routing.

6.4.2.3. Reduce Alternative Paths

   Due to the requirement of reliability, the connectivity in the
   Internet is rich result in many paths toward a particular
   destination. In another word, there are many alternative paths in the
   BGP routing table towards the same destination which consumes router
   memory and routing processing burden.

   To make routing scale, it is desirable to reduce alternate paths
   while preserving reasonable redundancy. For example, on a given
   border router (such as a NAP router), one primary path plus an
   alternate path should provide reasonable redundancy. In this case, a
   third or a fourth alternate route could be discarded for the sake of
   scaling.  This is a trade-off decision every network administrator
   needs to make based on the particular needs of her network.

6.4.2.4. Utilizing New Technologies

   New technologies such as MPLS [11,12] would alleviate IGP scaling
   issues for large networks. A network with MPLS over SONET technology
   would have much less IGP adjacencies than that with IP over ATM
   overly technology. The reduction is due to the fact that IGP only
   route on physical links rather virtual links, therefore, IGP does not
   need to work with full-mesh adjacency topology. In addition, the
   deployment of MPLS could also free routers in the core network from
   carrying full external routes, which would significantly reduce the
   total amount of routes carried and processed by these routers. This
   is possible because, in an MPLS domain, Label Switched Path (LSP) can
   be established within the core network. An ingress edge router that
   functions as a Label Switch Router (LSR) could assign a packet with a
   label. Each LSR in the core along the LSP would forward the packet
   based on the label, eliminating the need for full routing knowledge
   in the core routers.

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles          [Page 15]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

6.4.3. Use Static Route at Edge

   As mentioned earlier, one of the scaling issues in large networks is
   that a single router may fan out to hundreds of customer routers. As
   a result, resource consumption will be very intensive if all the
   customer routers BGP with the edge router. At first glance, it seems
   necessary for a customer network in a different Administrative
   System(AS) to exchange routing information with the provider network
   via BGP. However, it is not necessary the case. When a customer
   network is single-homed; that is, if the sole network connection for
   a customer is via its provider network, static routing can work in
   this situation. Since the customer network is single-homed, static
   routing will not have any negative impact on services. The advantages
   are that the customer aggregation router will have fewer E-BGP
   sessions to handle, and no route flapping can result from the
   statically configured customer routes.

   Configuration of the customer's static routes on the provider's
   aggregation router may add management overhead, especially if a
   customer advertises a large number of routes. On the other hand, the
   set of routes a customer announcing to provider network changes
   infrequently thus it requires low maintenance once it is configured.

6.4.4. Minimize the Impact of Route Flapping

   As discussed earlier, route flapping is largely caused by link
   instability and/or BGP session instability that results in excessive
   routing updates across the Internet. Route flapping can originate
   anywhere in the global Internet and affect every network in the
   Internet routing mesh (BGP mesh). Given there are about 60,000 routes
   known to the Internet and there is little isolation for route
   flapping, handling of route flapping could be overwhelming to routers
   in any network.

   One way to reduce the effect of route flapping is to turn on route
   dampening as specified in [10]. Essentially, dampening suppresses an
   unstable route until it becomes stable. The current practice is for
   each ISP to enable route dampening on its border routers. This way,
   the excessive routing updates can be stopped at the border.

   An ideal model is to suppress the announcement of a flapping route
   right at the source. One way to implement this is to have a router
   recognize instability associated with its directly connected links
   and suppress the announcement of the route. So far, there is no such
   implementation.  This approach should be explored.

   Route aggregation often masks route flapping since components of an
   aggregated route (more specific routes) would not cause the

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles          [Page 16]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   aggregated route to flap. Therefore using CIDR would also help to
   alleviate route flapping.

6.5. Scalable Routing Policy and Scalable Implementation

   Routing policy involves routing decisions about acceptance and
   advertisement of certain routes to or from other networks and about
   routing preference when more than one route becomes available.
   Routing policy enforces business agreements between network entities
   and is largely governed by non-technical criteria. In essence,
   routing policy involves defining criteria for route filtering and
   route selection.

   One aspect of route filtering has to do with traffic control between
   routing domains or between different provider networks. Making policy
   based on individual prefixes should be avoided in this case because,
   with 60,000 prefixes in the Internet, it does not scale. Making
   policy based on ASs that administratively represent a set of prefixes
   scales better.

   Another purpose of route filtering is to protect the integrity of
   routing information by preventing accepting falsely advertised
   routing information that would lead traffic to black holes. In this
   case, only prefix-based filtering will sufficiently achieve the goal.
   Prefix-based filtering needs to occur at the borders between a
   network and its direct customers or peer networks. The filtering is
   harder to manage at the boundary of the peer networks since a peer
   network usually advertises a large amount of prefixes. As mentioned
   earlier, there are about 60,000 routes known to the Internet. This
   means a large default-free network would need to filter in the order
   of hundred thousands prefixes or even more since a route could be
   advertised by more than one sources. The sheer amount of the prefixes
   to be filtered imposes challenges for router configuration memory and
   configuration management. To make it scale, one would need to rely on
   the help from out-of-band process to sort out which prefix should be
   accepted or denied from which source. IRR [13] and DNS [14] are among
   the current proposed mechanisms for implementing prefix-based
   filtering.

   Route selection policy determines which path would be used to send
   traffic toward a certain destination. This is important, for example,
   when a network has two connections to another network and learns
   routes from both connections.  The decision would be involving which
   path to use to send traffic to the customers behind the other
   network. The choices are typically:

      o Direct traffic to the closest path for traffic to exit the
        network. This policy is also known as Hot-Potato-Routing.

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles          [Page 17]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

      o Direct traffic to the optimal network exit point. The optimal
        exit point is determined based on certain criteria by the network
        administrator and is not necessary the closest exit point.
      o Always prefers routes advertised by directly connected customers
      o Allow other network or customer to determine the path

   When a policy is defined, its implications for scalable
   implementation needs to be considered. For example, if the policy
   allows customer to determine which paths traffic follows, customers,
   not the provider, should be required to set routing parameters to
   make the routing favor their preferred path. Customers can use the
   BGP community or mechanisms such as MED to set routing preferences in
   a much more scalable way. This avoids putting such routing management
   burdens solely on the provider. Distributing the routing management
   burden makes the policy implementation more scalable.

   Another scaling measure is to avoid making complex policy. When
   routing policy is complex, the management such as configuration of
   the router and debugging would be a problem. The ultimate goal is to
   make the network manageable.

   The following basic principles would help scaling the routing policy
   management.

      o Make policies as simple as possible but meet the requirements
      o Automate as much as possible to avoid error-prone manual work
      o Avoid policy based on individual prefix as much as possible with
        the exception of prefix-based route filtering for protecting
        routing integrity
      o Avoid making exceptions
      o Use out-of-band routing policy process where possible

6.6. Out-of-Band Process

   A typical router assumes both routing and forwarding functions.
   However, conceptually, routing and forwarding are two separate
   processes. A router's ultimate task is to forward packets based on
   its forwarding table, which is derived from routing information. One
   of the main causes of route scaling problems is that routers run out
   of steam because routing requires too much processing. While a router
   has to forward packets, it does not necessarily have to exchange and
   process routing information or execute routing policy; these tasks
   can be performed elsewhere. Thus the question should be: Would it be
   possible to remove the routing process from a router to reduce its
   burden? Moving the routing process from the routers to other systems
   is referred to as out-of-band route processing.

   Out-of-band route processes would, in short, perform the heavy-duty

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles          [Page 18]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   routing tasks. They would build a forwarding table for the router,
   select routes based on pre-defined policy, filter routes, and shield
   the router from route flapping attacks.

   The shortcomings of out-of-band route processing are the possible
   introduction of delays in routing changes; the de-coupling of routing
   and forwarding paths, which could introduce inaccurate routing
   information; and the cost of extra equipment.

   Appendix A presents a current example of out-of-band route
   processing. It also suggests other possible solutions.

7. Conclusion and Discussion

   How routing scales has direct impact on network stability and
   performance.  With the fast growth of the Internet and consequently
   fast expanding of providers' network, routing scaling become more and
   more an important issue to address. This document identifies the
   major factors that affect route scalability and establishes basic
   principles for designing scalable routing in large networks.

   The major routing scaling issues we are facing today are excessive
   router resource consumption due to routing processing burdens causing
   network instability; and routing complexity resulting in difficulties
   of management and trouble shooting causing degradation of service.

   The outlined principles for designing a scalable routing system are
   building routing hierarchy; reducing routing processing burden where
   possible; defining manageable routing policies and using assistant of
   out-of-band routing process.

   Using out-of-band resource to assist routing processing is a concept
   only been used in the IXPs, there are a lot of potential to use it
   within a network to help addressing routing scaling issues. This is a
   topic worthy further exploring.

   Routing protocols and/or its implementations can still be improved or
   enhanced for better handling of the scaling issues. For example, the
   IS-IS multiple area mechanism is needed in order to scale the IGP in
   large network. Also, using multicast or reliable flooding mechanism
   for I-BGP updates instead of pairwise full mesh peering is something
   worth investigating.

   It is our believe that even with the deployment of new technologies
   such as DWDM, MPLS and others in the future, the fundermental routing
   scheme will remain the current IGP/BGP paradigm.  Therefore, the
   scalable routing design principles outlined in this document should
   still apply with the deployment of new technologies.

Appendix A. Out-of-Band Routing Processes

   The use of a Route Server(RS) at NAPs is an example of achieving
   routing scalability through an out-of-band routing process. A NAP is
   a public inter- connection point where ISP networks exchange traffic.
   ISP routers at a NAP establish BGP peer sessions with each other. The
   result is full mesh E-BGP peering with a complexity of O(N^2) system
   wide. When the RS is in place, each router peers only with the RS
   (and its backup) to obtain necessary routing information (or more
   precisely, the necessary forwarding information). In addition, the RS
   also filters routes and execute policy for each provider's router,

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles          [Page 21]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   which further reduces the burden on all routers involved.

   The concept of the Route Server can also be used to help address
   routing scalability in a large network.

   1) RS Assisted Peering between Customer Aggregation Router and
   Customer Routers

   Currently, in a typical large provider network, it's not unusual that
   a customer aggregation router connect up to hundreds of customer
   routers. That means the router has to handle hundreds of E-BGP
   sessions and numerous number of prefix filtering. These tasks would
   impose a heavy burden on the aggregation router. Reducing the number
   of customer router per aggregation router is not an optimal option
   since this would introduce more routers in the routing system of the
   whole network, which is neither scalable for backbone routing, nor
   cost efficient. Using RS between customers and the providers'
   customer aggregation router become an attractive option to reduce the
   burden on the router.

   Figure 1 shows one way to incorporate an RS router between a
   provider's customer aggregation router and customer routers.

           Figure 1: RS serving customer aggregation router in
                     connecting customer routers

   In a scenario without an RS, the customer aggregation router(CR) has
   to peer with customer routers C1, C2 ... Cn (where n could be in the
   hundreds). When an RS router is introduced, CR, C1, C2 ... Cn each
   peer with the RS router instead, and the RS passes the processed
   routing information (or forwarding information) to all of them
   according to policy and filters.

   The advantages are obvious:

   o The customer aggregation router peers only with the RS router

Yu                 Scalable Routing Design Principles          [Page 22]

Internet Draft      draft-yu-routing-scaling-01.txt           June, 1999

   instead of with hundreds of customer routers.

   o The customer aggregation router does not need to filter prefixes or
   process routing policies, which frees resources for packet forwarding
   and handling.

   One general concern with the use of an RS router is the possibility
   of a mismatch of routing connectivity and the physical connectivity.
   For example, if the link between the CR and C1 is down and if the RS
   router is not aware of the outage, it will continue to pass routes
   from C1 to the CR, and the traffic following these routes will be
   black holed. However, this is not a problem in the case described
   here. This is because the RS router has to go through the CR to peer
   with C1, C2 ... Cn, when the link is down, C1 is inaccessible from
   the RS router, and no routing information can be exchanged between
   the two. Consequently, the RS will announce no routes related to C1.

   Another concern is the creation of single point of failure. If the RS
   router is down, no routing information can be exchanged between the
   customer aggregation router and C1, C2 ... Cn, and no traffic will
   flow between them. This problem could be addressed by adding a second
   RS router as a backup.

   In this scenario, since RS peers with C1 ... Cn via CR, it requires
   that when the RS router passes routing information to C1...Cn, it
   designates the IP address of the CR as the next hop. Likewise, when
   the RS router passes routes from each customer router to the customer
   aggregation router, it needs to place the correct next hop on the
   route. Modifications need to be made to the RS code to include this
   function.

   2) Private RS Router at InterExchange Point

   A large provider network often has many BGP peers at the
   Interexchange Point, NAP or private interconnection. This means a
   border router has to handle many E-BGP sessions. Since an
   Interconnect points is usually the administrative boundaries between
   ISPs, policy and route filtering are very demanding. This imposes a
   scaling problem on the border router.

   Deploying many routers to distribute the load among them is an
   expensive solution: Extra hardware and extra ports cost money.
   Shifting the routing burden to an RS router is a promising solution.
   In the case of using RS for multiple peers at a private interexchange
   point, the scenario is similar to RS used between customer
   aggregation router and customer routers as described in 1) above. In
   the case of such peering at a NAP, the private RS could be placed
   either on the same NAP media or a private media between the ISP's NAP

   3) RS Routers at Each POP in a Large Network

   Even in a network with a hierarchical routing structure, a sub-area
   may become too large, and I-BGP full meshing may impose a scaling
   problem. One way to address this would be to split the sub-area or
   add yet another tier of I-BGP reflector structure. Another possible
   solution would be to use an RS router as an I-BGP Server. Depending
   on the topology of a POP, this solution may or may not be suitable.
   The use of RS routers at network POPs should be investigated further.
