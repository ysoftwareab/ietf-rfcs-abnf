          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
          defines objects for managing ATM-based interfaces, networks
          and services.

          This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both
          compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the
          peer SNMPv1 definitions.

          [Temporary Note:  Upon progression of this specification as a
          Proposed Standard, an SNMPv2 and an SNMPv1 version of this MIB
          module will be made available to ease migration.]

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          3.  Change Log

          This section tracks changes made to the revisions of the
          Internet Drafts of this document.  It will be deleted when the
          document is published as an RFC.

          The following changes were made for the version of the
          document dated August 9, 1993.

            - Representation of the ATM layer in the Interface
              Group has been modified as follows:
              The ATM layer objects are now represented using
              the fixedLengthGroup in the ifTable.  The objects
              supported are ifIndex, ifDescr, ifType, ifSpeed,
              ifPhyAddress, ifAdminStatus, ifOperStatus, ifLastChange,
              ifInOctets, ifInErrors, ifInUnknownProtos, ifSpecific,
              ifName, ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable, ifHighSpeed, ifHCInOctets,
              and ifHCOutOctets.   The ifPacketGroup does not apply
              to ATM layer.

            - The performance parameter group per virtual link has been removed.

            - The object atmInterfaceSpecific
              has been deleted from the atmInterfaceConfTable.

            - There was an error in the atmInterfaceTrafficEnforcementTypes

              which was corrected.

            - AAL3/4 and AAL5 are now represented as
              separate entries in the ifTable.
              The value of the ifType for AAL3/4 Common Part
              Convergence Sublayer (CPCS) is the
              ifType of the SMDS Interface Protocol (SIP).  The
              AAL3/4 CPCS layer objects are represented
              using the SIP MIB, RFC 1304.

            - The value of the ifType for AAL5 is 49.  The
              representation of AAL5 using ifTable and in the
              ATM MIB is currently under study and will be
              included in the future.

            - The SONET Transmission Convergence (TC) sublayer is renamed
              as TC sublayer.  This is because TC sublayer can be used for
              carrying ATM directly over SONET as well as directly
              over DS3 or DS1 physical layers.


          The following changes were made for the version of the
          document dated July 15, 1993.

            - This MIB module is made compliant with SNMPv2 SMI.

            - This MIB module incorporates the changes agreed upon at the
              AToM MIB WG meeting in Amsterdam.

            - The objects atmInterfacePortIdentifier,
              atmInterfaceTransmissionType and
              atmInterfaceMediaType have been deleted from the
              atmInterfaceConfTable.  The object atmInterfaceIlmiVpiVci
              has been clarified.

            - Entries in the ifTable have been updated for ATM interface,
              and AAL level interfaces.

            - Representations of the AAL level interfaces in the Interface Group
              have been modified as follows:
              The AAL level is now represented per ATM interface and
              not per virtual connection. Therefore, the AAL
              pointer group is deleted.
              AAL3/4 and AAL5 CPCS layers are now combined and represented as
              a single entry in the Interface Group.

              AAl1 SAR layer is also now represented in the Interface Group.

            - Formal conformance statements have beed added.


          4.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

          The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
          components.  They are:


                 RFC 1442 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
                 describing and naming objects for the purpose of
                 management.

                 RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects
                 for the Internet suite of protocols.

                 RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other
                 architectural aspects of the framework.

                 RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network
                 access to managed objects.

          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          5.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [3] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
          the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI RFC 1442
          purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
          These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.  The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding
          rules of ASN.1 [4], subject to the additional requirements
          imposed by the SNMPv2.

          5.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 9 contains the specification of all object types
          contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined
          using the conventions defined in the SNMPv2 SMI.

          6.  ATM Terminology

          Some basic ATM terminologies are described in this section to
          facilitate defining the ATM managed objects and ATM management
          groups.


          6.1.  VCL/VPL and VCC/VPC

          There are two distinct types of ATM virtual connections:
          Virtual Channel Connections (VCCs) and Virtual Path Connection
          (VPCs).  As shown in the figures below, ATM virtual
          connections are made of virtual links such as Virtual Channel
          Links (VCLs) or Virtual Path Links (VPLs). The VCI/VPI or VPI
          field in the ATM cell header associates each cell with a
          particular VCL or VPL over a given physical link.


           <-----------------------VCC------------------------------->
                    ----------                ----------
                    | ATM    |                |  ATM   |
                    |        |                |        |
          O<------->|Switch  |<-------------->|Switch  |<------------>O
             VCL1   |        |     VCL2       |        |      VCL3
                    ----------                ----------
           <---a managed segment-->
           <------------------a managed segment----------------------->


            Figure 1: Virtual Channel Links and Virtual Channel Connection

          As shown in Figure 1, end-to-end VCCs are created by the
          concatenation of VCLs. This is a path composed of more than
          once VCL spanning multiple network nodes to form a connection
          between two end-points.  The VCLs used to form a VCC all have
          the same traffic characteristics (i.e., bandwidth parameters,
          QoS Class parameters, etc.).  The switch routes cells between
          VCLs, thereby, forming VCCs across the network.  The VCCs are
          bi-directional by definition.  However, the traffic parameters
          in two directions of the connection can be symmetric or
          asymmetric, i.e., the two directions of the virtual connection
          can have the same or different traffic flows.  Therefore, a
          uni-directional traffic flow across a VCC is achieved by
          assigning a zero bandwidth in one direction.

          Internet Draft      ATM Management Objects    October 19, 1993


          An ATM equipment (e.g., a router, switch or network) typically
          does not support a VCC end-to-end, but only a segment of the
          VCC (see Figure 1).  Therefore, the managed resource is
          typically a VCC segment and the management of an end-to-end
          VCC is achieved by appropriate management of its individual
          components.

          Many VCLs may be carried within a single VPL.  All VCLs within
          a single VPL share the same VPI value in the ATM header.  In
          turn, several VPLs can be carried over a single physical link.



             <-----------------------VPC----------------------------->
                       ----------                ----------
                       | ATM    |                |  ATM   |
          VCCs         |        |                |        |
          <--|---------|Switch  |----------------|Switch  |----------|-->
          <--|         |        |                |        |          |-->
          <--|---------|        |----------------|        |----------|-->
               VPL1    ----------    VPL2        ----------   VPL3

             <---------a managed segment--------->
             <-------------------a managed segment------------------->


              Figure 2: Virtual Path Links and Virtual Path Connection

          End-to-end VPCs are created by the concatenation of VPLs and
          may be viewed as a logical bundle of VCCs as shown in Figure
          2.  An end-to-end VPC may be used by a user to group all those
          VCCs going to the same destination.  The switch switches VPLs
          while ignoring the VCLs within it.  Thus, at the switching
          point, a translation is performed on the VPL identifier fields
          (i.e., the VPI) in the ATM cell header.  The VPI field does
          not have end-to-end significance over the entire VPC.  Note
          that, for a switch or network supporting a VPC, only the VCI
          value has end-to-end significance since the switch or the
          network does not process the VCI field.  Therefore, in the
          context of a given switch or network, VPC and VCC are non-
          overlapping virtual connections.

          A switch or network typically does not support a VPC end-to-
          end, but only a segment of the VPC (see Figure 2).  Therefore,
          in a switch or network, a managed resource is typically a VPC

          segment and the management of an end-to-end VPC is achieved by
          appropriate management of its individual components.


          6.2.  PVC and SVC

          A Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) is a provisioned VCC or
          VPC.  A Switched Virtual Connection (SVC) is a switched VCC or
          VPC that is set up in real-time via call set-up signaling
          procedures.  A PVC (or an SVC) can be a point-to-point,
          point-to-multipoint, or multipoint-to-multipoint VCC or VPC.


          6.3.  Traffic Management Parameters

          6.3.1.  Traffic Policing and Traffic Shaping Parameters

          In order to allocate resources fairly among different users,
          it is usually necessary to police traffic at different
          resource access points.  The traffic enforcement or policing
          taken at a UNI is called Usage Parameter Control (UPC) and is
          activated on an incoming VCL or VPL as shown in Figure 3.  The
          use of the traffic enforcer at the ingress of the connection
          is to make sure that the user traffic does not exceed the
          negotiated traffic parameters such as the peak cell rate.


                     ----------                   ----------
              UNI    |  ATM   |       NNI         |  ATM   |      UNI
               |     | switch |        |          | switch |       |
          O<---|---->X(UPC)   |<-------|--------->|   (UPC)X<------|--->O
               | VCL |        |        | VCL      |        |   VCL |
                     ----------                   ----------


                         Figure 3: An Example of a UPC

          In addition, traffic shaping may be performed on an outgoing
          VPL or VCL at a given ATM interface.  The function of the ATM
          traffic shaper at the egress of the connection is to smooth
          the outgoing cell traffic inter-arrival time.  If policing or
          shaping is not performed then the policing or shaping
          parameters are zero.

          6.3.2.  Cell Loss Priority

          To prioritize traffic during resource congestion, ATM cells
          are assigned one of the two types of Cell Loss Priority (CLP),
          CLP=0 and CLP=1.  ATM cells with CLP=0 are treated as higher
          priority traffic than ATM cells with CLP=1.


          6.3.3.  QoS Class

          A VCC or VPC is associated with one of a number of Quality of
          Service (QoS) classes.  Four QoS classes have been specified
          to support service class A (constant bit rate video and
          circuit emulation), service class B (variable bit rate
          video/audio), service class C (connection-oriented data) and
          service class D (connectionless data).  The VCLs (or VPLs)
          concatenated to form a VCC (or VPC) will all have the same QoS
          class as that of the VCC (or VPC).  Note that, the cell loss
          ratio, Cell Delay Variation (CDV), and end-to-end cell delay
          parameters are defined as part of QoS Class definition.


          7.  Overview

          ATM management objects are used to manage ATM interfaces and
          ATM virtual connection segments supported by a switch, host,
          or network.  This section provides an overview and background
          of how to use this MIB and other potential MIBs for this
          purpose.

          The purpose of this memo is primarily to manage ATM PVCs.
          Management of ATM SVCs may require additional capabilities
          which are currently outside the scope of this memo.


          7.1.  Background

          The ATM MIB shall be used for ATM Customer Network Management
          (CNM) and ATM Network Management (NM) purposes for managing
          ATM interfaces and ATM virtual connections.  Anything inside a
          switch or network is invisible and therefore shall not be
          manageable by the ATM MIB.  The ATM MIB shall support
          configuration, fault, and performance management of:

                     (1) ATM interfaces

          Internet Draft      ATM Management Objects    October 19, 1993



                     (2) ATM virtual connections

          In addition, other MIB modules are necessary to manage ATM
          interfaces and connections.  Examples include MIB II for
          general system and interface management, the DS3 or SONET MIBs
          for management of physical interfaces, and, as appropriate,
          MIB modules for applications that make use of ATM, such as
          SMDS.  These MIB modules are outside the scope of this
          specification.

          The current specification of this ATM MIB is based on SNMPv2.

          7.2.  Structure of the MIB

          The managed ATM objects are arranged into the following groups
          for management of (1) ATM local interfaces and (2) ATM virtual
          connections.  For a switch or network that terminates or
          originates VCCs, the management of ATM local interfaces also
          includes management of ATM adaptation layers for ATM
          applications.  In addition, managed ATM objects for
          activation/deactivation of OAM cell flows and ATM traps
          notifying virtual connection or virtual link failures such as
          VP-AIS may be needed and are under study.

                  (1) ATM interface configuration group
                  (2) ATM interface DS3 PLCP group
                  (3) ATM interface TC Sublayer group
                  (4) ATM Virtual Connection Segment (VPC/VCC) groups

          The groups listed above are the basic units of conformance. If
          the semantics of a group are applicable to an implementation,
          then it must implement all objects in that group.  For
          example, a managed agent must implement the VCC group if and
          only if it manages the VCCs.


          7.3.  ATM Interface Configuration Group

          This group is designed to manage ATM cell layer configuration
          of local ATM interfaces on an ATM device.  In addition, this
          group provides pointers to any additional MIB modules (e.g.,
          enterprise-specific) that may be needed to manage this
          interface.

          7.4.  ATM Interface DS3 PLCP and TC Layer Groups

          These groups provide performance statistics of the DS3 PLCP
          and TC sublayer of local ATM interfaces on a managed ATM
          device.  DS3 PLCP and TC sublayer are currently used to carry
          ATM cells respectively over DS3 and SONET transmission paths.

          7.5.  ATM Virtual Connection Segment Groups

          7.5.1.  Introduction

          In these groups, managed segments of virtual connections are
          modeled as a set of unidirectional traffic flows between an
          ingress and an egress of a switch or network (see Figure 4).
          This allows for independent treatment of the forward and
          backward traffic flows of virtual connections, and allows for
          the management of all possible topologies (pt/pt, pt/mpt,
          mpt/mpt).

                      Figure 4 - Model unidirectional traffic flow

          The In and Out in this model necessarily differs from the
          model in the ifTable of MIB II, where the In/Out is measured
          at the same port. The relationship is shown in Figure 5.

          Figure 5 - Relation Local In/Out with Virtual Connection Ingress/Egress


          Each Ingress-Egress flow is represented as a separate entry in
          the atmConnectionTables.  This approach accommodates
          unidirectional, bidirectional, point-to-point, point-to-
          multipoint, and multipoint-to-multipoint topologies.  It also
          allows for efficient searching by port number.  For example, a
          bidirectional point-to-point virtual connection between port 1
          and port 2 is represented by the entries:
                    {Port1VCx-Port2VCy}
                    {Port2VCy-Port1VCx}

          Similarly, a bidirectional point-to-multipoint virtual
          connection from port 1 to ports 2 and 3, is represented by the
          entries:
                     {Port1VCx-Port2VCy}
                     {Port1VCx-Port3VCz}
                     {Port2VCy-Port1VCx}
                     {Port3VCz-Port1VCx}

          A bidirectional multipoint-to-multipoint virtual connection
          between ports 1, 2, and 3 is represented by the entries:
                    {Port1VCx-Port2VCy}

                    {Port2VCy-Port1VCx}
                    {Port2VCy-Port3VCz}
                    {Port3VCz-Port1VCx}
                    {Port3VCz-Port2VCy}


          A unidirectional multicast from port 1 to ports 2, 3, and 4
          ports 1, 2, and 3 is represented by the entries:
                    {Port1VCx-Port2VCy}
                    {Port1VCx-Port3VCz}
                    {Port1VCx-Port4VCw}

          The purpose of atmConnectionTable is to specify for each
          managed virtual connection segment supported by the ATM
          equipment (e.g., a router, switch or network):
                 1) Its identifier at the ingress
                 2) Its identifier at the egress
                 3) The characterization of the virtual connection.

          7.5.2.  Virtual Connection Identifiers at Ingress and Egress

          The virtual connection identifiers at ingress and egress of
          the ATM equipment must be locally unique to the equipment.
          For VCCs, this is achieved by the tuples:
               {atmVCConnectionIngressPort, atmVCConnectionIngressVpi,
                                          atmVCConnectionIngressVci}, and
               {atmVCConnectionEgressPort, atmVCConnectionEgressVpi,
                                          atmVCConnectionEgressVci}

          For VPCs, this is achieved by the tuples:
               {atmVCConnectionIngressPort, atmVCConnectionIngressVpi}, and
               {atmVCConnectionEgressPort, atmVCConnectionEgressVpi}


          7.5.3.  Virtual Connection Characterization

          A virtual connection segment is characterized by the following
          parameters:

            Status: status of the virtual connection segment,
            Quality of Service (QoS): specifying performance objectives
                    for the virtual connection segment,
            Traffic policer: specifying the traffic enforcement policy
                    at the ingress of the virtual connection segment, and

          Internet Draft      ATM Management Objects    October 19, 1993


            Traffic shaper: specifying the traffic enforcement policy
                    at the egress of the virtual connection segment.


          7.5.4.  Sets

          Requests for new virtual connections, discontinuation of
          existing virtual connections, and modifications of existing
          virtual connections are accommodated by proper use of the
          atmConnectionTableEntryStatus column. The structure of the
          atmConnectionTableEntry allows to request and fully qualify
          new connections by a single set operation. The status column
          follows the textual convention RowStatus defined in [RFC1443].

          [Needs text specifying its use under SNMPv1].

          Not all managed resources may support sets for this table.
          Furthermore, sets on the individual columns are only supported
          within the range of values, supported by the ATM equipment.

          The set capability shall only be supported for PVCs. SVCs are
          set up via appropriate call signaling procedures.

          The creation of one or more rows in this table has the
          following effects:
            - A virtual connection of the specified type, and with the specified
              qualifications shall be provisioned,
            - Associated entries in the local interface tables shall be created.

          The following constraints apply to virtual connection
          modifications:

          [text to be provided. there are probably cases where one
          cannot do certain modifications.  For example, can one change
          a unidirectional PVC to a bidirectional one?  Can one change
          the QoS of an existing virtual connection?  And so on.]

          For some ATM equipments, requests for changes in the virtual
          connection table may be honored after a period of time, due to
          provisioning activities.  SNMPv2 provides the means to
          accommodate it [RFC1441-1452].  However, management under
          SNMPv1 does not accommodate these needs.

          7.5.5.  Virtual Connection Association with Interface
          Addresses

          Interface addresses may not be typically freely allocated, and
          are usually assigned by the provider of the switch or network
          (e.g., the public service provider in case of a public
          network).  Furthermore, addresses may be assigned without
          virtual connections being established. Therefore, these
          addresses appear in the local interface tables, and not in the
          atmConnectionTable.


          7.5.6.  Management of an End-to-End Virtual Connection

          [to be supplied - text explaining that one needs to figure out
          which switches or networks/managed VC segments take part in
          the virtual connection, and that one needs to string the
          virtual connection table info of each of those segments
          together if one wants to know the whole story]


          8.  Application of MIB II to ATM

          8.1.  The System Group

          This specifies how the System Group defined in MIB II shall be
          used for ATM agent/proxy agent.  For ATM switches or ATM
          networks, the sysServices object in the System Group has the
          value "2" which implies that the ATM switch, host or network
          is providing a subnetwork level service.


          8.2.  The Interface Group

          This specifies how the Interfaces Group defined in MIB II
          shall be used for the management of ATM based interfaces, and
          in conjunction with the ATM MIB modules. This memo assumes the
          interpretation of the Interfaces group to be in accordance
          with [5] which states that the interfaces table (ifTable)
          contains information on the managed resource's interfaces and
          each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of a network
          interface is considered an interface.  Thus, the ifTable
          allows the following ATM-based interfaces to be represented as
          table entries:

          - ATM cell level interfaces in the ATM equipments (e.g.,
            switches, hosts, routers or networks) with ATM interfaces.
            This level is concerned with generic cell counts and
            not with individual virtual connections.


          In accordance with the guidelines of ifTable, cell counts per
          virtual connection are not covered by ifTable, and is
          considered interface specific.  In order to interrelate the
          ifEntries properly, the Interfaces Stack Group defined in [5]
          shall be supported.


          8.2.1.  Support of the ATM Cell Layer by ifTable

          Some specific interpretations of ifTable for the ATM cell
          layer follow.

          Object            Use for the generic ATM layer.

                            for use by the ATM layer.
          ifPhysAddress     The address for this interface. If an interface has
                            multiple addresses, then this is its primary
                            address.  If an interface has no addresses, then
                            this is an octet string of zero length.
          ifAdminStatus     See [5].
          ifOperStatus      Assumes the value down(2) if the ATM cell layer or
                            any layer below that layer is down.
          ifLastChange      See [5].
          ifInOctets        The number of received octets over the
                            interface, i.e., the number of received,
                            assigned cells multiplied by 53.
          ifOutOctets       The number of transmitted octets over the
                            interface, i.e., the number of transmitted,
                            assigned cells multiplied by 53.
          ifInErrors        The number of cells dropped due to
                            uncorrectable HEC errors.
          ifInUnknownProtos The number of received cells discarded
                            during cell header validation, including
                            cells with unrecognized VPI/VCI values,
                            and cells with invalid cell header patterns.
                            If cells with undefined PTI values are discarded,

                            of zero length.
          ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable    Default is disabled (2).

          8.2.2.  Support of the AAL3/4 by RFC 1304

          The AAL3/4 CPCS layer is represented using the SMDS Interface
          Protocol (SIP) L3 table in the SIP MIB, RFC1304.  For the
          management of AAL3/4 CPCS layer, all objects in the SIP L3
          table are supported.

          To be provided.



          9.  ILMI MIB and The ATM Managed Objects

          The ILMI MIB is specified by the ATM Forum in UNI
          specification document [11], to manage local ATM UNIs.  The
          support of the ATM management functions by the ILMI MIB and
          the ATM MIB are compared in Table 1.  In the table below,
          "yes" in ILMI column indicates that the management functions
          are supported by the ILMI MIB.  The MIB groups in the ATM MIB
          column are the groups listed in Section 6.2.

          *The operational and administrative status of the ATM
          interface and the physical transmission type shall be
          supported by the interface table in MIB II.

          **The ILMI MIB contains local and end-to-end operational
          status of the VPC/VCC.  However, it does not contain the
          administrative status of the local VPC/VCC.  Also, the ILMI
          MIB contains policing parameters, shaping parameters and QoS
          class as local information and not as virtual connection
          information.

          The table 1 shows that the ILMI MIB supports most of the ATM
          functions that are supported by the ATM MIB groups 1, 4, and
          interface group in MIB II. The ILMI MIB contains the QoS
          Class, traffic policing and shaping parameters as the local
          interface information.  This specification supports these
          functions in the virtual connection group to facilitate
          setting up or modifying virtual connections.  This approach
          does not change the semantics of these variables, only the
          OBJECT IDENTIFIERs of these variables change.
