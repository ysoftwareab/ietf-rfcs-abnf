      AsciiRFC: Authoring Internet-Drafts And RFCs Using AsciiDoc
                        draft-ribose-asciirfc-08

Abstract

   This document describes an AsciiDoc syntax extension called AsciiRFC,
   designed for authoring IETF Internet-Drafts and RFCs.

   AsciiDoc is a human readable document markup language which affords
   more granular control over markup than comparable schemes such as
   Markdown.

   The AsciiRFC syntax is designed to allow the author to entirely focus
   on text, providing the full power of the resulting RFC XML through
   the AsciiDoc language, while abstracting away the need to manually
   edit XML, including references.

   This document itself was written and generated into RFC XML v2
   (RFC7749) and RFC XML v3 (RFC7991) directly through asciidoctor-rfc,
   an AsciiRFC generator.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at https://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on October 20, 2018.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a markup language called "AsciiRFC",
   developed specifically for the purpose of generating RFC XML
   document, based on Asciidoctor syntax.  AsciiRFC can be used to
   generate compliant RFC XML v2 and v3 documents through the usage of
   an open source, MIT-licensed Ruby gem called "asciidoctor-rfc"
   written by the authors [asciidoctor-rfc].

1.1.  Designed for authoring RFCs and Internet-Drafts

   Internet-Drafts and RFCs intended for publication submission to the
   IETF can be written in a multitude of formats today, including:

   o  XML: RFC XML v2 [RFC7749] and v3 [RFC7991]

   o  nroff: through [NroffEdit]




Tse, et al.             Expires October 20, 2018                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


   o  Microsoft Word: through usage of [RFC5385]

   o  Lyx: through [lyx2rfc]

   o  Pandoc: [RFC7328], through [pandoc2rfc] or [draftr]

   o  Kramdown: through [kramdown-rfc2629]

   o  mmark: through [mmark]

   Interestingly, the last three are Markdown [RFC7763] variants.

   As specified in [RFC7990], the IETF intends for the canonical format
   of RFCs to transition from plain-text ASCII to RFC XML v3 [RFC7991].
   While plain-text will continue to be accepted from authors by the
   IETF, at least in the short- to medium-term, XML will be preferred
   for submission, and any plain-text submissions will need to be
   converted to RFC XML v3.

   While this need is already met for RFC XML v2 [RFC7749] by the tools
   specified above, the transition to RFC XML v3 [RFC7991] places added
   onus on authors to generate compliant XML.

1.2.  Relationship between AsciiRFC, AsciiDoc and Asciidoctor

   [AsciiDoc] is a lightweight markup language and an alternative to
   Markdown, with features that make it attractive as a markup language
   for RFC with XML output.

   [Asciidoctor] is an open source, MIT-licensed Ruby implementation of
   [AsciiDoc] that provides an enhancement of the original AsciiDoc
   markup language.

   The variant of AsciiDoc syntax accepted by [Asciidoctor] is hereafter
   called "Asciidoctor syntax".

   AsciiRFC, as described in this document, is an AsciiDoc variant
   developed on Asciidoctor syntax, created for the purpose of
   generating RFC XML documents.

1.3.  Comparison with RFC XML tools based on Markdown variants

   Section 1.2 of [RFC7764] famously states that "there is no such thing
   as 'invalid' Markdown, there is no standard demanding adherence to
   the Markdown syntax, and there is no governing body that guides or
   impedes its development."  While there are contexts where that
   flexibility is useful, the authoring of RFCs does have a standard and
   a governing body, and there is such a thing as invalid RFC XML.  A

   more rigorous and extensible counterpart to Markdown, which still
   preserves its basic approach to formatting, can generate RFC XML that
   encompasses a fuller subset of the specification, and preempts
   malformed RFC XML output.  The proposed markup language and
   associated Ruby gem has several advantages that we believe make it
   worth considering as an approach to generating RFC XML.

   o  AsciiDoc was designed from the beginning as a publishing language:
      it was initially intended as a plain-text alternative to the
      DocBook XML schema.  For that reason, Asciidoctor natively
      supports the full range of formatting required by RFC XML
      (including notes, tables, bibliographies, source-code blocks, and
      definition lists), without resorting to embedded HTML or Markdown
      "flavours".

   o  AsciiRFC covers the full range of elements in RFC XML v2 and RFC
      XML v3.

   o  AsciiDoc in its Ruby-based Asciidoctor implementation is
      extensible, with a well-defined API.  (Extensions have been
      harnessed to deal with bibliographic preprocessing for AsciiRFC.)

   o  AsciiRFC allows granular control of rendering, including user-
      specified attributes of text blocks.

   o  The Asciidoctor implementation allows document inclusion, for
      managing large-scale documentation projects.

   o  AsciiRFC allows granular control of permutations of block nesting,
      such as source code within lists or definition lists within
      unordered lists.

   o  As a more formal counterpart to Markdown, AsciiDoc is well-suited
      to generating XML that needs to conform to a specified schema.
      The asciidoctor-rfc Ruby gem developed around AsciiDoc validates
      its RFC XML output against the RelaxNG schema defined for RFC XML,
      and reports any issues to the end user.

   o  The asciidoctor-rfc Ruby gem incorporates validation not only of
      the XML structure of the standard, but also of the IETF workgroups
      it mentions against the latest listing online, and the
      bibliographic entries for RFC and other standards registered on
      <https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org>.  The gem also dynamically
      fetches bibliographic entries from the xml2rfc site, and uses them
      to populate the RFC XML document.

   As with Markdown, there is a wide range of tools that can render
   AsciiDoc; so AsciiRFC drafts of RFC documents can be previewed and

   accessed without depending on the RFC tools ecosystem.  Our
   realisation of RFC XML in AsciiRFC has aimed to ensure that, as much
   as possible, the markup language can be can be processed by generic
   Asciidoctor tools.

   The only exception to this as an add-on is the optional bibliography
   module, which allows bibliographies to be assembled on the fly based
   on citations in a document: see Section 17.2.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

2.1.  Terms and Definitions

   The following terms and definitions apply to this document:

   AsciiDoc
      The AsciiDoc markup language generically, as described in
      [AsciiDoc].

   Asciidoctor syntax
      The enhanced AsciiDoc syntax implemented by the [Asciidoctor] Ruby
      gem.

   AsciiRFC
      The AsciiDoc syntax developed for the purpose of generating RFC
      XML document based on Asciidoctor syntax, as described in this
      document.

2.2.  Wrapping Lines in Documentation Examples

   This document contains a number of examples as fragments of XML.  In
   some cases, the examples contain URLs that are over 72 characters
   long and so need to be wrapped for presentation in this document even
   though they would not need to be wrapped in the actual source XML.

   This document adopts a policy similar to that described in
   [I-D.wu-netmod-yang-xml-doc-conventions] to denote line wraps.  When
   an XML example contains a URL, that URL is always included in double-
   quotes.  If the URL would extend beyond 72 characters, the line is
   wrapped and the wrap is indicated with a backslash ("\").  The
   backslash appears without any additional space before the backslash
   and with no further characters after the backslash.

   For example, the following XML...

   <format type="TXT" target=
     "http://www.example.org/citations/cookpot.txt"/>

   ...may be presented as

   <format type="TXT" target=
     "http://www.example.org/citations/\
     cookpot.txt"/>

3.  Document Structure and Syntax

   AsciiRFC consists of a subset of Asciidoctor syntax with the addition
   of bibliographic macros (Section 17.2).  Asciidoctor syntax is
   presented in the Asciidoctor user manual [Asciidoctor-Manual].

   AsciiRFC syntax consists of:

   o  A document header, containing a title, a list of authors, and
      document attributes in lines prefixed with ":".

   o  An optional document preamble, separated from the document header
      by a blank line, and not containing any section titles.

   o  A number of sections, set off by a section title (a line prefixed
      with two or more "=".)

   A section may contain:

   o  Other sections, whose level of nesting is indicated by the number
      of "=" in their header.

   o  Blocks of text.  Blocks can have metadata (including a title, an
      anchor for cross-references, and attributes.)

   Blocks can be:

   o  Paragraphs, which are terminated by blank lines.

   o  Lists.  List items are by default paragraphs, but can span over
      multiple paragraphs.

   o  Delimited blocks (with a line delimiter on either side of them);
      these include tables, notes, sidebars, source code, block quotes,
      examples, and unprocessed content (e.g. raw XML).  Delimited
      blocks contain by default one or more paragraphs.

   o  List items can contain other blocks, including both nested lists
      and delimited blocks.

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


   o  Some delimited blocks can contain other delimited blocks; for
      example, examples can contain source code as well as discussion in
      paragraphs.

   o  Blocks of text consist of inline text, which itself can contain
      markup.

   Inline markup includes:

   o  Text formatting: Bold, italic, superscript, subscript, monospace.

   o  Markup macros: the "bcp14" and "comment" macros.  (Asciidoctor
      syntax supports custom markup macros.)

   o  URLs, including display text to render.

   o  Inline anchors.

   o  Cross-references to anchors (IDs of blocks or spans of text),
      including display text to render.

   o  Images: SVG only, as specified in [RFC7996].

   o  Index terms.

3.1.  Unsupported features compared with Asciidoctor syntax

   Several features from Asciidoctor are not supported within AsciiRFC
   due to the lack of support within RFC XML, including:

   o  Audio and video files are not supported in AsciiRFC as today's RFC
      XML structure does not support audio or video.

   o  Equations are not supported as there is no current RFC XML
      equivalent.  Asciidoctor provides native support for [AsciiMathML]
      and [TeX-LaTeX], via the [MathJax] tool.

   o  Footnotes are not supported in AsciiRFC as there is no equivalent
      semantic representation in RFC XML.

   These carved out features can be easily supported by AsciiRFC once
   RFC XML allows these elements.

3.2.  Mapping To RFC XML syntax

   The Asciidoctor syntax document structure aligns with both the RFC
   XML v2 and the RFC XML v3 structure.  In the following, RFC XML v3
   equivalences are given to the basic Asciidoctor structure.

   Preamble
      "front/abstract" and "front/note".

   Sections
      "middle/section" elements.

   Sections with bibliography style attribute

   Sections with appendix style attribute
      "back/section" elements.

   Paragraphs
      "t" elements.

   Lists
      "ul", "ol", "dl" elements.

   Delimited blocks

   Inline markup
      "bcp14", "br", "cref", "em", "eref", "iref", "relref", "strong",
      "sub", "sup", "tt", "xref".

   Full details of the mapping of AsciiRFC elements to RFC XML v2 and v3
   elements, and of how to convert AsciiRFC documents to RFC XML, are
   given in the documentation of [asciidoctor-rfc].

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


  [abstract]

  This document provides a template on how to author (or migrate!)
  a new Internet-Draft / RFC in the AsciiRFC format.

  This template requires usage of the `asciidoctor-rfc` Ruby gem.

  [#introduction]
  == Introduction

  AsciiRFC <<I-D.ribose-asciirfc>> is an extremely simple way to
  author Internet-Drafts and RFCs without needing to manually
  craft RFC XML conforming to <<RFC7991>>.

  This is a template specifically made for authors to easily
  start with creating an Internet-Draft conforming to <<RFC7991>>
  and submittable to the IETF datatracker.

  [#conventions]
  == Terms and Definitions

  The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
  "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*",
  "*NOT RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
  <<RFC2119>> <<RFC8174>> when, and only when, they appear in
  all capitals, as shown here.

  This document also refers to the following terms and
  definitions:

  AsciiRFC::
  an AsciiDoc-derived syntax used for authoring RFCs and
  Internet-Drafts, as defined in <<I-D.ribose-asciirfc>>.

  [#symbols]
  == Symbols And Abbreviations

  ADRFC::
  abbreviated form of AsciiRFC


  [#security]
  == Security Considerations

  Any security considerations should be placed here.

  As described in <<main>> (here's how you refer a local anchor),

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


  local tools have to be installed before the document template
  can be built.

  Running of these local tools *MAY* produce unintended side
  effects that impact security.

  [#iana]
  == IANA Considerations

  This document does not require any action by IANA.

  But if it does, such as proposing changes to IANA registries,
  please include them here.

  <abstract>
  <t>This document describes an AsciiDoc syntax
  extension called AsciiRFC, designed for authoring IETF
  Internet-Drafts and RFCs.  AsciiDoc is a human readable document
  markup language which affords more granular control over markup
  than comparable schemes such as Markdown.  The AsciiRFC syntax
  is designed to allow the author to entirely focus on text,
  providing the full power of the resulting RFC XML through the
  AsciiDoc language, while abstracting away the need to manually
  edit XML, including references.  This document itself was
  written and generated into RFC XML v2 (RFC7749) and RFC XML v3
  (RFC7991) directly through asciidoctor-rfc, an AsciiRFC
  generator.</t>

                Figure 1: Sample Internet-Draft in AsciiRFC

   The first block of text, from "= Template For Writing An Internet-
   Draft In AsciiRFC" through to ":email_2: thomas.kandell@brown.edu",
   is the document header.  It contains a title in the first line, an
   author attribution ("Josiah Carberry; Thomas Kandell"), and then a
   set of document attributes, conveying information about the document
   as well as information about its authors.  This information ends up
   in RFC XML either as attributes of the root "rfc" tag, elements of
   the "front" tag, or processing instructions.

   The following blocks of text, up until the first section header ("==
   Introduction"), are the document preamble.  They are treated by the
   document converter as containing the document abstract ("abstract"),
   followed by any notes if present.

   Section headers delimit the sections of the main body of the
   document, starting with "== Introduction".  The document converter
   treats the first section of the document as the start of the "middle"
   section in RFC XML.  The first section header is followed by a
   paragraph, and other sections and paragraphs.  The number of "="
   signs can be one higher than that of the preceding section header,
   which indicates that they are subsections of that section; so "===
   Operators" is a subsection of the preceding "== Symbols And
   Abbreviations".

   The paragraphs contain some inline formatting (e.g. boldface:
   "*MUST*", monospace: "`type`"), and sections can also contain blocks
   other than normal paragraphs; the section "== Operators", for
   example, contains a definition list (whose terms are delimited by
   "::"), and the subsection "=== Example 1" contains a code snippet
   (delimited by "----", and tagged with the style attribute
   "[source,json]", indicating that this is a JSON sourcecode listing).
   The document can also include comments ("//" for inline, "////" for
   blocks), which are not rendered when the document is processed.

   The introductory section in this example contains a citation of a
   reference, which in this version of AsciiRFC is treated identically
   to a cross-reference ("<<RFC7253>>") -- the crossreference being to
   the references section of the document.  Sections and blocks of texts
   within the document can also be the target of crossreferences; for
   example, the section header "=== Operators" is preceded by the anchor

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


   "[#operators]", and that anchor is already referenced in the section
   "== Security Considerations".

   The third last and second last section are tagged with the style
   attribute "[bibliography]", which identifies them as references
   containers; the document converter accordingly inserts them into the
   "back" element under RFC XML.  The contents of the references
   sections are in this instance raw XML, delimited as a passthrough
   block (with "++++"), which the converter does not alter.

   The final section is tagged with the style attribute "[appendix]",
   and is treated as such.

     Figure 2: Sample Internet-Draft In AsciiRFC, Output In RFC XML v3
                                  Format

   Some default processing instructions have already been prefixed to
   the XML.

   Our AsciiRFC converter can also generate RFC XML v2 from the same
   source AsciiRFC, as shown in Figure 3.  Output in RFC XML v2 is not
   extensively described in this document.

     Figure 3: Sample Internet-Draft In AsciiRFC, Output In RFC XML v2
                                  Format

4.  Header And Document Attributes

   The header gives the document title, followed by an optional author
   attribution, and a series of document attributes, with no empty
   lines.

4.1.  Title And Basic Attributes

   Document attributes are used to populate attributes of the root "rfc"
   element, "front" elements, and document-level processing
   instructions.

   o  ":doctype:" determines whether the document will be considered
      "rfc" or "internet-draft", and interprets other attributes
      accordingly.

   o  Certain attributes ("workgroup", "area", "keyword") are comma
      delimited, and result in repeated RFC XML elements.

   Figure 4 demonstrates how to set the document header in AsciiRFC,
   with its rendering in RFC XML v3 shown in Figure 5.

   Figure 9: AsciiRFC Document Header With Multiple Authors (RFC XML v3)

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


   The initial author attribution in AsciiRFC, e.g.  "Gabriel Destiny;
   Charlise Luck" in the example above, expects a strict format of First
   Name, zero or more Middle Names, Last name, and cannot process
   honorifics like "Dr." or suffixes like "Jr.".

   Name attributes with any degree of complexity should be overriden by
   using the ":fullname:" and ":lastname:" attributes.  The AsciiRFC
   ":forename_initials:" attribute replaces the built-in Asciidoctor
   syntax ":initials:" attribute (which includes the surname initial),
   and is not automatically populated from the name attribution.

4.3.  XML Processing Information

   A document header may also contain attribute headers which are
   treated as XML processing instructions.  An AsciiRFC example is shown
   in Figure 10 with its rendering in Figure 11.  (Note that several
   processing instructions are included by default in the output of the
   AsciiRFC processor.)

                               (RFC XML v3)

   In the foregoing, values for the processing instructions "strict",
   "compact", "toc" etc are included by default; but "comments" and
   "notedraftinprogress" are included as specified in the AsciiRFC
   document header.  The default values provided for processing
   instructions can in fact be overriden through the AsciiRFC document
   header.

   :no-rfc-bold-bcp14: false
      overrides the wrapping by default of boldface uppercase BCP14
      [RFC2119] words (e.g. "*MUST NOT*") with the "bcp14" element.

   :smart-quotes: false
      overrides Asciidoctor's conversion of straight quotes and
      apostrophes to smart quotes and apostrophes.

   :inline-definition-lists: true
      overrides the RFC XML v2 "idnits" requirement that a blank line be
      inserted between a definition list term and its definition.

5.  Preamble

   The preamble in AsciiRFC is the text between the end of the document
   header (which terminates with a blank line) and the first section of
   text.

   Any paragraphs of text in the preamble are treated as an abstract,
   and may optionally be tagged with the "abstract" style attribute.

   Any notes in the preamble are treated as a "note" element.

   An example of setting the preamble is given in Figure 16 with its
   rendering in Figure 17.

   [abstract]
   The menagerie of beasts and artefacts depicted in RFC8140
   may be usefully supplemented by other renowned figures of
   Internet and more general lore. This document extends the
   menagerie to the seminal fable of the
   "Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch", as depicted in the
   Monty Python film "Monty Python and the Holy Grail",
   as well as "Spamalot", the musical inspired by the movie.

   [NOTE,remove-in-rfc=false]
   .Spamalot
   The relevance of the musical "Spamalot" to Internet lore should be
   obvious to the reader; but in case of doubt, see also
   Section 1 ("What is Spam*?") of RFC2635.

6.  Sections and Paragraphs

   Section headers are given with a sequence of "=", where the number of
   instances of "=" gives the header level.  The document itself opens

   with a single "=", and sections within it must be started with a
   minimum of "==".

   Section numbering is toggled with the in-document attribute
   ":sectnums:" (on), ":sectnums!:" (off).  The boolean "toc" attribute
   can also be set on sections, indicating whether the section can be
   included in the document's table of contents.

   Figure 18 shows how sections and paragraphs are used in AsciiRFC, and
   its rendered form is shown in Figure 19.

   The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
   "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*",
   "*NOT RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <<RFC2119>> <<RFC8174>>

   Note that skipped sections, such as defining a section using "===="
   within a section defined using "==", is not allowed in AsciiRFC
   syntax.  Doing so will trigger an error with the following message:

   asciidoctor: WARNING: _filename_: line _X_:
     section title out of sequence: expected level 2, got level 3

7.  Figures

   AsciiRFC examples (corresponding to RFC XML Figures), source code
   Listings, and Literals (preformatted text) are all delimited blocks.
   Listings and Literals can occur nested within Examples.

   An AsciiRFC example with a figure is given in Figure 20, and its
   rendering in Figure 21.

8.1.  Basic Lists

   AsciiRFC supports ordered, unordered, and definition lists.
   Indentation of ordered and unordered lists is indicated by repeating
   the list item prefix ("*" and "." respectively); for definition
   lists, it is indicated by incrementing the number of definition term
   delimiters ("::").

   List attributes can be used to specify the type of symbol used for
   ordered lists.

   An example of an unordered list is shown in Figure 24 (with its
   rendered version in Figure 25).  An example of an ordered list with
   ordered and unordered sublists is shown in Figure 26 (with its
   rendered version in Figure 27).  An example of a definition list is
   shown in Figure 28 (with its rendered version in Figure 29).

8.2.  List Continuation

   A list item by default spans a single paragraph.  A following
   paragraph or other block element can be appended to the current list
   item by prefixing it with "+" in a separate line.

   See the "List Continuation" section in [Asciidoctor-Manual] for more
   information.

   An example of list continuation with text is shown in Figure 30 with
   its rendered version in Figure 31.

   <CODE BEGINS>

   Trojan Rabbit::
   In their siege of the French-occupied castle which may already
   contain an instance of the Grail, Sir Bedevere the Wise proposes to
   use a Trojan Rabbit to infiltrate the castle, with a raiding party
   to take the French "not only by surprise, but totally unarmed."
   +
   The proposal, unsurprisingly, proved abortive. The more so as the
   raiding party forgot to hide within the Trojan Rabbit, before the
   French soldiers took the Trojan Rabbit inside the castle.

   Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog::
   Guarding the entrance to the Cave of Caerbannog; see <<caerbannog>>.

   (Multiple paragraphs are not permitted within a list item in RFC XML
   v2.  The RFC XML converter deals with this by converting paragraph
   breaks into line breaks within a list item.)

   List continuations can also be embedded to populate a list item with
   a sequence of blocks as a unit (in an Asciidoctor syntax open block).

   An example of list continuation with a delimited block is shown in
   Figure 32 with its rendered version in Figure 33.

       Figure 33: AsciiRFC List With Block Continuation (RFC XML v3)

   AsciiDoc, and thus AsciiRFC, considers paragraphs to be the basic
   level of blocks, and does not permit lists to be nested within them:
   any text after a list is considered to be a new paragraph.

   Therefore, markup as shown in Figure 34 cannot be generated via
   AsciiRFC.

9.  Blockquotes

   Asciidoctor syntax supports blockquotes and quotations of verse; its
   block quotations permit arbitrary levels of quote nesting.  RFC XML
   v3, and thus AsciiRFC, only supports one level of blockquotes.

   Unlike RFC XML v2, RFC XML v3 does not support line breaks outside of
   tables, so verse quotations are converted to prose in the v3
   converter.

   An example of using AsciiRFC Blockquotes is given in Figure 35 with
   its rendered version in Figure 36.

10.  Notes And Asides

   Asciidoctor syntax supports a range of "admonitions", including
   notes, warnings, and tips.  They are indicated by a paragraph prefix
   (e.g.  "WARNING:"), or as a block with an admonition style attribute.

   All admonitions are conflated in AsciiRFC, being converted to "note"
   elements in the document preamble, and "cref" elements in the main
   document.

   This means that no admonitions will therefore appear in the textual
   output, unless forced to through the "comments" processing
   instruction.  A sample admonition is shown in Figure 37, with its
   rendered output in Figure 38.

   With RFC XML v2, note that no inline formatting is permitted for
   "cref" elements, and any such formatting is therefore stripped for v2
   by the converter.

   Because paragraphs in AsciiRFC cannot contain any other blocks, a
   comment at the end of a paragraph is treated as a new block.  In the
   document converter, any such comments are moved inside the preceding
   RFC XML paragraph; if the comment is at the start of a section, as in
   the example above, it is wrapped inside a paragraph.

   The RFC XML v3 converter also supports "asides" (Asciidoctor syntax
   Sidebars).  A sample is shown in Figure 39, with its rendered output
   in Figure 40.

   AsciiRFC tables, like RFC XML v3, support distinct table heads,

   A sample of an AsciiRFC table is shown in Figure 43, with its

   Neither version of RFC XML is as expressive in its table structure as
   Asciidoctor syntax.  RFC XML, for example, does not permit blocks
   within table cells.

12.  Inline Formatting

12.1.  Italics, Boldface, Monospace, Subscripts, Superscripts

   AsciiRFC supports italics, boldface, monospace, subscripts and
   superscripts, just like RFC XML v3.

   The inline formatting syntax given in Figure 45 produces the RFC XML
   v3 output given in Figure 46.

   communication, to wit the exchange between the
   _Knights of the Round Table_
   and the taunting French soldiers serving under *Guy de Lombard* are,
   properly speaking, outside the scope of this `menagerie`, being more
   or less human. Notwithstanding, several^ish^ beasts both animate~d~
   and wooden played a significant part in this encounter; most
   notably:

12.2.  Formatting BCP 14 Keywords

   RFC XML v3 also supports tagging of BCP14 keywords [RFC2119]
   [RFC8174]; this is done in AsciiRFC either by tagging them with a
   custom formatting span (e.g.  "MUST NOT"), or by converting any
   boldface all-caps words recognised as BCP14 words (unless the ":no-
   rfc-bold-bcp14: false" document attribute is set).

   Any spans of BCP14 text delimited by inline formatting delimiters
   need to be contained within a single line of text; in Asciidoctor
   syntax, formatting spans are broken up across line breaks.

   This usage is demonstrated in Figure 47 with the rendered output in
   Figure 48.

12.3.  Escaping AsciiRFC Syntax

   Formatting delimiters like "*" can be escaped with backslash ("\*");
   double formatting delimiters, like "**" and "__", need to be escaped
   with double backslash ("\\**").

   Escaping delimiters is not always reliable, and for double delimiters
   it is preferable to use HTML entities ("&#42;&#42;"), or attribute
   references (references to the value of attributes set in the document
   header) as shown in Figure 49.

   In extreme circumstances (such as quoting AsciiDoc syntax), you may
   need to resort to altering the substitutions behaviour within a given
   block of of AsciiDoc; see the "Applying Substitutions" section of
   [Asciidoctor-Manual].

13.  Links

   Common URL formats are recognised automatically as hyperlinks in
   AsciiRFC, which inherits this excellent feature from AsciiDoc, and
   are rendered as such.

   Any hyperlinked text is appended after the hyperlink in square
   brackets.

   An example is given in Figure 50 with its rendered version in
   Figure 51.

14.  Cross-References

14.1.  Basic Referencing

   Anchors for cross-references are notated as "[[...]]" or "[#...]",
   and can be inserted on their own line in front of most blocks.

   Asciidoctor syntax supports anchors in a much wider range of contexts
   than is supported than RFC XML v3 (let alone v2); anchors that are
   not supported for that version of RFC XML are simply ignored by the
   converter.

   Note that anchors in RFC XML are constrained to the format "[A-Za-
   z_:][[A-Za-z0-9_:.-]*" (i.e. "xsd:ID").

   Cross-references to anchors are notated as "<<...>>"; cross-
   references with custom text as "<<reference,text>>".

   An example of using cross-references in AsciiRFC is given in
   Figure 54 with its rendered output in Figure 55.

14.2.  Referencing With Attributes

   While Asciidoctor syntax natively does not support attributes on
   cross-references, AsciiRFC works around that by embedding formatting
   information as templated text within cross-references:

   o  "format= x: text" populates the "xref@format" attribute

   o  a section number followed by one of the words "of", "parens",
      "bare", "text" is treated as a "relref" reference to an external

15.  Inclusions

   AsciiRFC inherits the Asciidoctor syntax "include" directive
   [Asciidoctor-Manual] to include external files in a master AsciiRFC
   document.

   This directive is capable of sophisticated document merging,
   including adjusting the heading levels of the included text,
   selecting text within specified tags or line numbers to be included,
   and adjusting the indentation of code snippets in merged text.

   Its basic syntax is given in Figure 60.

   ]
   <CODE ENDS>

                     Figure 60: Inclusions In AsciiRFC

   If a file is included in an AsciiRFC document, ensure it ends with a
   blank line.  An inclusion that results in its final block not being
   delimited with a blank line from what follows can lead to
   unpredictable results.

16.  Encoding and Entities

   XML accepts the full range of characters in the world's languages
   through UTF-8 character encoding, and one of the motivations for the
   move by the IETF from plain text to RFC XML has been to allow non-
   ASCII characters to be included in RFCs.

   However, current RFC XML v2 tools still do not support UTF-8, and
   alternative tooling support for UTF-8 also remains patchy.  Out of an
   abundance of caution, the RFC XML converter uses US-ASCII for its
   character encoding, and renders any non-ASCII characters as HTML
   entities.

   AsciiRFC accepts HTML entities as input, even though they are not
   part of the W3C XML specification.  HTML entities such as "&nbsp;"
   feature in examples of RFC XML provided by the IETF.  In order to
   prevent dependence of the XML output from extraneous entity
   definitions, any such entities are rendered in the XML as decimal
   character entities.

   An example of how AsciiRFC renders non-ASCII UTF-8 characters are
   given in Figure 61 with the output in Figure 62.

   Note that because initial period is a formatting character in
   Asciidoctor, we have had to use "&#x2e;" to escape the period at the
   end of Hebrew sentences (which appears at the start of the line,
   Hebrew being written Right-to-Left).  Asciidoctor is not natively
   equipped to deal with Right-to-Left languages in its formatting
   parsing.

17.  Bibliography

   The simple encoding of bibliography syntax provided by AsciiDoc (and
   Asciidoctor syntax) is inadequate for the complexity of bibliographic
   markup required by RFC XML.

   RFC documents overwhelmingly cite other RFC documents, and canonical
   RFC XML bibliographic entries are available at [IETF-BibXML]; so it
   would be inefficient to encode those entries natively in AsciiRFC,
   only to have them converted back to RFC XML.

   The converter provides two means of incorporating bibliographies into
   RFC documents authored in AsciiRFC:

   o  using raw RFC XML; and

   o  assembling bibliographies in preprocessing.

   In either case, the RFC XML needs to be well-formed; missing closing
   tags can lead to erratic behaviour in the converter.

17.1.  Using Raw RFC XML

   In the first method, bibliographic citations are handled like all
   other AsciiRFC cross-references.  The bibliographic entries for
   normative and informative references are given in the AsciiRFC as
   passthrough blocks, which contain the raw RFC XML for all references;
   document conversion leaves the raw RFC XML in place.

   This approach requires authors to maintain the normative and
   informative bibliographies within the document, to update them as
   citations are added and removed, and to sort them manually.  However,
   if the citation is stored on the IETF's RFC XML citation libraries
   (see <https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org>), AsciiRFC will automatically
   replace it with an external reference to that citation.  So the body
   of the citation XML can be left out.

   For example, the AsciiRFC in Figure 63 will generate the
   corresponding RFC XML v3 output in Figure 64.

17.2.  Preprocessing Using "asciidoctor-bibliography"

   The alternative method is to use a preprocessing tool,
   [asciidoctor-bibliography], to import citations into the AsciiRFC
   document from an external file of references.

   The references file consists of RFC XML reference entries, and still
   needs to be managed manually; however the bibliographies are
   assembled from that file, sorted, and inserted into the normative and
   informative references in preprocessing.  Citations in the document
   itself are given as macros to be interpreted by the preprocessor;
   this allows them to be split into normative and informative
   references.  (The MMark tool likewise splits reference citations into
   normative and informative.)

   Integration with the "asciidoc-bibliography" gem proceeds as follows:

   1.  Create an RFC XML references file, consisting of a "<references>"
       element with individual "<reference>" elements inserted, as would
       be done for the informative and normative references normally.
       The references file will contain all possible references to be
       used in the file; the bibliography gem will select which
       references have actually been cited in the document.

       A.  Rather than hand crafting RFC XML references for RFC
           documents, you should download them from an authoritative
           source; e.g., "http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/bibxml/\
           reference.RFC.2119.xml".  Note that RFC XML references from
           this link contains the XML document declaration, which needs
           to be removed before being used in the XML bibliography.

       B.  Unlike the case for RFC XML documents created manually, the
           references file does not recognise XML entities and will not
           attempt to download them during processing.  Any references
           to "http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/bibxml/\ " will need
           to be downloaded and inserted into the references file.

       C.  The RFC XML in the references file will need to be
           appropriate to the version of RFC XML used in the main
           document, as usual.  Note that RFC XML v2 references are
           forward compatible with v3; v3 contains a couple of
           additional elements.

   2.  Add to the main document header attributes referencing the
       references file (":bibliography-database:"), and the bibliography
       style (":bibliography-style: rfc-v3").

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


   3.  References to a normative reference are inserted with the macro
       "cite:norm[id]" instead of "<<id>>", where "id" is the anchor of
       the reference.

   4.  References to an informative reference are inserted with the
       macro "cite:info[id]" instead of "<<id>>", where "id" is the
       anchor of the reference.

   5.  Formatted crossreferences and "relref" crossreferences are
       entered by inserting the expected raw XML in the "text"
       attribute.  Do not use the "{cite}" interpolation of the
       citation.  For example:

       *  "<<id,words>>" = "cite:norm[id, text="<xref target=
          'id'>words</xref>"]"

       *  "<<id,format= counter: words>>" (processed as a formatted
          cross-reference) = "cite:norm[id, text="<xref format='counter'
          target= 'id'>words</xref>"]"

       *  "<<id,2.4 comma: words>>" (processed as relref) =
          "cite:norm[id, text="<relref displayFormat='comma'
          section='2.4' target= 'id'}/>"]"

       *  "<<id#section2_4,2.4 comma: words>>" (processed as relref with
          a cross-document internal reference) = "cite:norm[id,
          text="<relref relative='section2_4' displayFormat='comma'
          section='2.4' target= 'id'/>"]"

   6.  Normative and Informative References are inserted in the document
       through a macro, which occurs where the RFC XML references would
       be inserted, as shown in Figure 65.

18.  RFC XML features not supported in Asciidoctor

   The following features of RFC XML v3 [RFC7991] and v2 [RFC7749] are
   not supported by the AsciiRFC converter, and would need to be
   adjusted manually after RFC XML is generated:

   +------------------------+--------------------+---------------------+
   | RFC XML element        | RFC XML v3         | RFC XML v2          |

19.  Authoring

   To author an AsciiRFC document, you should first familiarise yourself
   with the [Asciidoctor-Manual].

   The [asciidoctor-rfc] Ruby gem source code distribution also has
   samples of individual RFC XML features in v2 and v3, and examples of
   self-standing AsciiRFC documents, along with their RFC XML
   renderings.  (This includes round-tripped RFC XML documents.)

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


19.1.  Using the "rfc-asciirfc-minimal" template

   In addition, you can clone the sample "rfc-asciirfc-minimal"
   repository as a template, and populate it for your AsciiRFC document
   using the steps shown in Figure 66.

   $ git clone https://github.com/riboseinc/rfc-asciirfc-minimal

             Figure 66: Cloning The AsciiRFC Document Template

19.2.  Installing AsciiRFC Backend Processors

   Converting your AsciiRFC to RFC XML is a simple as installing the
   Asciidoctor Ruby gem "asciidoctor" (see "Installation" at
   [Asciidoctor]) and the "asciidoctor-rfc" gem in Ruby (through
   RubyGems), then running the "asciidoctor" executable on the document,
   specifying the "asciidoctor-rfc" gem as a library.

   The necessary steps are shown in Figure 67.

$ gem install asciidoctor-rfc
$ asciidoctor -b rfc3 -r 'asciidoctor-rfc' foo.adoc  # RFC XML v3 output
$ asciidoctor -b rfc2 -r 'asciidoctor-rfc' foo.adoc  # RFC XML v2 output

           Figure 67: Installing The AsciiRFC Backend Processors

19.3.  Iterating AsciiRFC Content

   As you author AsciiRFC content, you should iterate by running the
   AsciiRFC conversion frequently, to ensure that you are still
   generating valid XML through your markup.  The converter makes an
   effort to ensure that its XML output is valid, and it issues warnings
   about likely issues; it also validates its own XML output against the
   RFC XML schema (of the corresponding version), and reports errors in
   the XML output in the format shown in Figure 68.

   V3 RELAXNG Validation: 12:0: ERROR: Invalid attribute
   sortRefs for element rfc

         Figure 68: Sample Validation Error Message From AsciiRFC

   Note that validation against the Relax NG RFC XML schema includes
   confirming the referential integrity of all cross-references in the
   document.

   It may be necessary to intervene in the XML output generated by the
   converter, either because the block model of AsciiRFC does not
   conform with the intended RFC XML (e.g. lists embedded in



Tse, et al.             Expires October 20, 2018               [Page 80]

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


   paragraphs), or because RFC XML features are required that are not
   supported within AsciiRFC.

20.  Security Considerations

   o  Ensure your AsciiRFC generator comes from a geniune and
      trustworthy source.  This protects your own machine and also
      prevents injection of malicious content in your resulting
      document.

   o  An AsciiRFC generator may cause errors in textual rendering or
      link generation that may lead to security issues.

   o  Creating cross-references (and also bibliographic references) to
      external documents may pose risks since the specified external
      location may become controlled by a malicious party.

   o  URIs that start with the "http:" or "https:" prefix are
      automatically converted into links in AsciiRFC except when escaped
      with a backslash before the prefix.  A URI that is intended to be
      text but unintentionally rendered as a link may cause users to
      visit a malicious website with security consequences.

   o  AsciiRFC contains syntax that can directly incorporate remote URI
      content, such as "include::" which allows remotely-located
      AsciiRFC content files.  If a remote URI contains malicious
      content, this content will be included in the resulting AsciiRFC
      document compiled as RFC XML.  Remotely-linked URIs should always
      be checked for malicious content prior to compiling AsciiRFC into
      RFC XML.

21.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action by IANA.

  [abstract]

  This document provides a template on how to author (or migrate!)
  a new Internet-Draft / RFC in the AsciiRFC format.

  This template requires usage of the `asciidoctor-rfc` Ruby gem.

  [#introduction]
  == Introduction

  AsciiRFC <<I-D.ribose-asciirfc>> is an extremely simple way to
  author Internet-Drafts and RFCs without needing to manually
  craft RFC XML conforming to <<RFC7991>>.

  This is a template specifically made for authors to easily
  start with creating an Internet-Draft conforming to <<RFC7991>>
  and submittable to the IETF datatracker.

  [#conventions]
  == Terms and Definitions

  The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
  "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*",
  "*NOT RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
  <<RFC2119>> <<RFC8174>> when, and only when, they appear in
  all capitals, as shown here.

  This document also refers to the following terms and
  definitions:

  AsciiRFC::
  an AsciiDoc-derived syntax used for authoring RFCs and
  Internet-Drafts, as defined in <<I-D.ribose-asciirfc>>.

  [#symbols]
  == Symbols And Abbreviations

  ADRFC::
  abbreviated form of AsciiRFC


  [#main]
  == Main content

  This is where you place the main content, and the following
  serves as a placeholder for your text.

  Subsections are used here for demonstration purposes.

  === Getting started

  The AsciiRFC and RFC toolchains *MUST* be available locally to
  build this document template.

  ==== AsciiRFC toolchain

  You will need to have:

  * Ruby: for running the AsciiRFC toolchain
  * `asciidoctor-rfc` gem: for converting AsciiRFC into XML RFC
  (v2 or v3)

  ==== XML RFC toolchain

  You will need to have:

  * Python: for running `xml2rfc`
  * `xml2rfc`: for converting RFC XML (v2 or v3) into TXT
  * `idnits`: for submission preflight


  === Referencing external content

  * This is a published RFC <<RFC7253>>

  * This is an Internet-Draft <<I-D.ribose-asciirfc>>

  * This is an external reference <<RNP>>


  [#code-snippets]
  === Code snippets

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


  Code snippets should be wrapped with `<CODE BEGINS>` and
  `<CODE ENDS>` blocks, as required by the IETF Trust Legal
  Provisions (TLP) <<IETF.TLP>> specified in <<RFC5378>>.

  [#security]
  == Security Considerations

  Any security considerations should be placed here.

  As described in <<main>> (here's how you refer a local anchor),
  local tools have to be installed before the document template
  can be built.

  Running of these local tools *MAY* produce unintended side
  effects that impact security.

  [#iana]
  == IANA Considerations

  This document does not require any action by IANA.

  But if it does, such as proposing changes to IANA registries,
  please include them here.

  <t>This document describes an AsciiDoc syntax
  extension called AsciiRFC, designed for authoring IETF
  Internet-Drafts and RFCs.  AsciiDoc is a human readable document
  markup language which affords more granular control over markup
  than comparable schemes such as Markdown.  The AsciiRFC syntax
  is designed to allow the author to entirely focus on text,
  providing the full power of the resulting RFC XML through the
  AsciiDoc language, while abstracting away the need to manually
  edit XML, including references.  This document itself was
  written and generated into RFC XML v2 (RFC7749) and RFC XML v3
  (RFC7991) directly through asciidoctor-rfc, an AsciiRFC
  generator.</t>

 [abstract]
 The menagerie of beasts and artefacts depicted in RFC8140
 may be usefully supplemented by other renowned figures of
 Internet and more general lore. This document extends the
 menagerie to the seminal fable of the
 "Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch", as depicted in the
 Monty Python film "Monty Python and the Holy Grail",
 as well as "Spamalot", the musical inspired by the movie.

 [NOTE,remove-in-rfc=false]
 .Spamalot
 The relevance of the musical "Spamalot" to Internet lore should be
 obvious to the reader; but in case of doubt, see also
 Section 1 ("What is Spam*?") of RFC2635.

 == Introduction

 <<RFC8140>> refers to the intended move of RFC formatting to
 XML2RFC v3 <<RFC7990>>, in the following terms:

 tag::quote1[]
 // tag::quote[]

 [quote,attribution="A. Farrel"]
 ____
 Although the RFC Editor has recently dragged the IETF kicking and
 screaming into the twentieth century [RFC7990] [RFC7996], there is a
 yearning among all right-thinking Internet architects to "keep it
 simple" and to return to the olden days when pigs could be given
 thrust without anyone taking undue offence.
 ____

 // end::quote[]
 [.comment]
 end::quote1[]

 While no pigs, flying or otherwise, are involved in the transition
 to RFC XML v3, it is opportune to enhance the <<RFC8140>>
 legendarium in the service of RFC XML v3, by illustrating its
 functionality through references to the mythology of Camelot, and
 particularly the incidents at the Cave of Caerbannog.

 [.comment]
 tag::escaped_hyperlink1[]
 // tag::escaped_hyperlink[]

 The screaming move into the twenty-*first* century is accompanied by
 a move back to the late twentieth century, with ASCII stylings more
 wonted in haunts like \ftp://ftp.wwa.com/pub/Scarecrow (known to be
 accessible in 1996.)

 There are two references to rabbits in
 _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ which are expounded on herewith:

 Trojan Rabbit::
 In their siege of the French-occupied castle which may already
 contain an instance of the Grail, Sir Bedevere the Wise proposes to
 use a Trojan Rabbit to infiltrate the castle, with a raiding party
 to take the French "not only by surprise, but totally unarmed."
 +
 The proposal, unsurprisingly, proved abortive. The more so as the
 raiding party forgot to hide within the Trojan Rabbit, before the
 French soldiers took the Trojan Rabbit inside the castle.

 Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog::

 The participants of that renowned exercise in cross-cultural
 communication, to wit the exchange between the
 _Knights of the Round Table_
 and the taunting French soldiers serving under *Guy de Lombard* are,
 properly speaking, outside the scope of this `menagerie`, being more
 or less human. Notwithstanding, several^ish^ beasts both animate~d~
 and wooden played a significant part in this encounter; most
 notably:

 * The Projectile Cow, see <<projectile-cow>>
 * The Trojan Rabbit, see <<trojan-rabbit>>

 ****
 While the exchange at the French-occupied castle is one of
 the more memorable scenes of _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_,
 the Trojan Rabbit has not reached the same level of cultural
 resonance as its more murderous counterpart. Reasons for this
 may include:

 * Less overall screen-time dedicated to the Trojan Rabbit.

 * The Trojan Rabbit as projectile has already been anticipated
 by the Cow as projectile.

 *Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog* <<killer_rabbit_caerbannog>>.
 It is the encounter between the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog and the
 Knights of the Round Table, armed with the Holy Hand Grenade of
 Antioch (see the <<holy_hand_grenade,following section>>), that we
 recount here through monospace font and multiple spaces.

 The *Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog*, that most formidable foe of
 the Knights and of all that is holy or carrot-like, has been
 depicted diversely in lay and in song. We venture to say,
 _contra_ the claim made in <<RFC8140,4.1 of: Ze Vompyre>>,
 that the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog truly is the most afeared
 of all the creatures. Short of sanctified ordnance such as
 <<holy_hand_grenade,format=title>>, there are few remedies
 known against its awful lapine powers.

 The solution to the impasse at the ((Cave of Caerbannog)) was
 provided by the successful deployment of the
 *Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch* (see <<hand-grenade-figure>>)
 (((Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch))).
 Any similarity between the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch and the
 mythical _Holy Spear of Antioch_ is purely intentional;
 (((relics, Christian))) any similarity between the Holy Hand Grenade
 of Antioch and the _Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom_
 (see <<sovereign-orb>>) is putatively fortuitous.

 Holy Spear of Antioch::
 A supposed relic of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, this is one
 of at least four claimed instances of the lance that pierced
 Christ's side. Its historical significance lies in inspiring
 crusaders to continue their siege of Antioch in 1098.

 Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom::
 Part of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, the Sovereign's
 Orb is a hollow gold sphere set with jewels and topped with a
 cross.  It was made for Charles II in 1661. See <<sovereign-orb>>.

 === Past the Killer Rabbit

 Once the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog (<<killer-bunny>>) had been
 dispatched, the Knights of the Round Table uncovered the last
 words of Joseph of Arimathea, inscribed on the Cave of Caerbannog
 in Aramaic.  While the precise Aramaic wording has not survived,
 we trust the following Hebrew subtitles will serve as an
 acceptable substitute:

 == IANA Considerations

 IANA might consider a registry to track the mythical, especially
 ravaging beasts, such as the Killer Rabbit, who haunt the Internet.


 == Security Considerations

 Do not let the Killer Rabbit out under any circumstance.

 I repeat. Do not let the Killer Rabbit (<<killer-bunny>>) out.

 <aside><t>While the exchange at the French-occupied castle is one of
 the more memorable scenes of <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em>,
 the Trojan Rabbit has not reached the same level of cultural
 resonance as its more murderous counterpart. Reasons for this
 may include:</t>
 <ul>
 <li>Less overall screen-time dedicated to the Trojan Rabbit.</li>
 <li>The Trojan Rabbit as projectile has already been anticipated
 by the Cow as projectile.</li>

 <!-- tag::relref1[] -->


 <t>The <strong>Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog</strong>, that most
 formidable foe of
 the Knights and of all that is holy or carrot-like, has been
 depicted diversely in lay and in song. We venture to say,
 <em>contra</em> the claim made in <relref section= "4.1" displayFormat=
 "of" target="RFC8140">Ze Vompyre</relref>,
 that the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog truly is the most afeared
 of all the creatures. Short of sanctified ordnance such as
 <xref format= "title" target= "holy_hand_grenade"/>, there are few
 remedies
 known against its awful lapine powers.</t>

 [abstract]

 This document describes a JSON HTTP API for online services that
 provide calendar-based fortune heuristics.

 == Introduction

 Fortune-telling, the practice of predicting information about a
 person's life, is an activity practiced throughout history.



Tse, et al.             Expires October 20, 2018              [Page 134]

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


 While there are myriad forms of fortune telling methodologies, this
 document applies to a particular form of service that provides fortune
 heuristics, commonly known as "luck", for a particular subject based
 on a calendar-based input.

 Since HTTP <<RFC7230>> status codes are insufficient to convey
 information about fortune heuristics, this specification defines a
 simple JSON <<RFC8259>> document format for this purpose. The
 response can be used by HTTP APIs to deliver results to non-human
 clients or to an end-user.


 == Conventions Used in This Document

 The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
 "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*",
 "*NOT RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document
 are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <<RFC2119>> <<RFC8174>>
 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

 The following definitions apply in this document:

 Well-known URI:: This specification makes use of the "well-known URI"
 feature of HTTP servers <<RFC5785>> to provide a bootstrapping URI for
 the client usage of fortune heuristics services.

 Root of Fortune:: The service discovery endpoint that provides a URI
 list of available fortune heuristic endpoints available, in accordance
 with <<service-discovery>>.

 == Fortune Heuristics Service Well-Known URI

 A well-known URI called "fortune" is registered by this specification
 for fortune heuristics services (see <<iana>>).

 Services complying with this document *SHOULD* have its well-known
 URI pointing (directly or through redirection) to the Root of Fortune.

 The Root of Fortune can be used by the client for service discovery,
 namely, the available calendar-based fortune heuristics services
 available on the server, as specified in <<service-discovery>>.

 === Well-Known URI Redirection

 Servers *MUST* redirect HTTP requests for that resource to the
 actual "context path" using one of the available mechanisms provided
 by HTTP <<RFC7230>> (e.g., using a 301, 303, or 307 response).




Tse, et al.             Expires October 20, 2018              [Page 135]

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


 Clients *MUST* handle HTTP redirects on the well-known URI.


 === Well-Known URI Cache Behavior

 Servers *SHOULD* set an appropriate Cache-Control header value (as
 according to <<RFC7234,5.2 of>>) in the redirect response to set
 caching behavior as required by the type of response generated.


 == New HTTP Methods: SEEK and DIVINE

 This specification defines two new HTTP methods: "SEEK" and "DIVINE"
 methods for HTTP <<RFC7230>>.

 While HTTP GET requests are treated equivalently as the "SEEK" and
 "DIVINE" requests, its usage is discouraged and therefore *SHOULD NOT*
 be used.

 Usage of these methods are defined in the sections below.


 == Defined Data Types: Date-Time Formats

 This specification defines a number of date-time formats as according
 to the conventions of <<RFC3339>> for the unambiguous communication
 between client and server.

 The types defined are as follows.

 `DATETIME`::
 As described in <<RFC3339,5.6 of>>, with the addition that reduced
 accuracy representations described in <<ISO.8601-1.2018>> are
 supported.  Reduced accuracy date and times are accepted where a
 date or time component (2-digits long) is replaced by "--".
 +
 For example, the date time "2018-04---T01:02:00Z" represents the UTC
 time of 1:02am, on an unknown day within April of the year 2018.

 `DATE`::
 As described in "DATETIME", but the "time" component will not be
 taken into account in the algorithm.

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


 === Root of Fortune Path URI ("/")

 The Root of Fortune URI, defined as "/" in this document, is used for
 service discovery on types of calendar-based fortune heuristics
 available.

 An empty SEEK request with the "application/json" request type
 *MUST* be sent to this endpoint to retrieve the available endpoints.
 All other HTTP methods *MUST NOT* be supported at this URI.

 An example of such a response is as follows:

 [source,json]
 ----
 HTTP/1.1 200 Success
 Content-Type: application/json
 Content-Language: en

 {
 "diviners" : [
 "/astrology",
 "/bazi",
 ]
 }
 ----

 A service discovery object *MUST* have the following members:

 `diviners`::
 (JSON array)
 An array that contains endpoints that conform to this specification.
 All endpoints listed here are relative to the Root of Fortune path.
 For example, the path "/astrology" listed in the example has an
 endpoint path of "[root-of-fortune]/astrology", where
 "[root-of-fortune]" indicates the real path of the Root of Fortune.


 // end::sample[]

 end::sample[]


 [#service-endpoint]
 == Fortune Heuristics Service Endpoint

 An endpoint offering fortune heuristics services *MUST* adhere to
 specifications in this section.

 A service *MAY* implement multiple divination services based on
 different divination methods, such as the digital oracle shown
 in <<digital-oracle>>.

 [#endpoint-report-interval-obj]
 === Report Interval Object

 The `intervals` value of a report object contains a number of report
 intervals -- each representing a non-overlapping period of the
 selected interval length. When all of these intervals are put
 together, the combined period *MUST* fully cover the requested
 report target period.



Tse, et al.             Expires October 20, 2018              [Page 144]

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


 An example interval object is shown below.

 [source,json]
 ----
 {
 "dateStart": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z",
 "dateEnd": "2018-02-01T00:00:00Z",
 "categories": [
 {
 "category":
 "https://divine.example.com/astrology/categories/health"
 "value": 80,
 "description": "Charge ahead with your excellent health."
 },
 {
 "category":
 "https://divine.example.com/astrology/categories/love"
 "value": 70,
 "description": "Give a certain person or situation another try!"
 },
 {
 "category":
 "https://divine.example.com/astrology/categories/finance"
 "value": 5,
 "description": "You've just realized that you don't have
 any cash on hand."
 }
 ]
 }
 ----

 An interval object *MUST* contain the following members:

 `dateStart`::
 (datetime, mandatory) This value specifies the start of the period
 which this interval object applies to.

 `dateEnd`::
 (datetime, mandatory) This value specifies the end of the period
 which this interval object applies to.

 In the given example, the `categories` key is an implementation
 specific object that details heuristic results returned by the
 selected algorithm. This *MAY* differ in different algorithms.


 [#endpoint-report-event-obj]
 === Report Events Object



Tse, et al.             Expires October 20, 2018              [Page 145]

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


 The `events` value of a report object contains a number of event
 objects. Each event object represents an event relevant to the
 calculation of fortune heuristics during a target report period. These
 events *MAY* be of variable time lengths, and *MAY* be overlapping
 amongst each other.

 The following example demonstrates two event objects the service
 determines relevant to a user's query.

 [source,json]
 ----
 {
 "dateStart": "2018-01-15T03:20:00",
 "dateEnd": "2018-01-16T20:22:15",
 "description": "The planet of growth and good luck, Jupiter will
 make a harmonious connection with power planet Pluto, helping you
 connect with influential people",
 "recommendation": "Engage in networking during this time."
 },
 {
 "dateStart": "2018-03-22T00:12:40",
 "dateEnd": "2018-03-28T02:45:03",
 "description": "Communication planet Mercury enters your sign,
 which will find you in a busier and chattier mood.",
 "recommendation": "Take charge of work with your newfound energy."
 }
 ----

 Similar to an interval object, an event object *MUST* contain the
 following members:

 `dateStart`::
 (datetime, mandatory) This value specifies the start of the period
 described by the event.

 `dateEnd`::
 (datetime, mandatory) This value specifies the end of the period
 described by the event.

 In the given example, the keys `description` and `recommendation`
 are implementation-specific details. This *MAY* differ in different
 algorithms.


 [#endpoint-report-errors]
 === Report Generation Errors

 This specification makes use of normal HTTP error codes with the



Tse, et al.             Expires October 20, 2018              [Page 146]

Internet-Draft           AsciiRFC Specifications              April 2018


 following extensions.

 Errors *MUST* be returned using the Problem JSON Structure as
 accordance with <<RFC7807>>.

 422 Unprocessable Entity::
 For example, a malformed date-time parameter, or an illogical input,
 such as when the subject's birthday occurs after the report target
 date period.

 473 Beyond Existing Capability::
 The service determines that the outcome is too difficult to predict.
 For example, in the case where the calculation is too complex to
 complete in a certain time period. The service *SHOULD* issue this
 response code to indicate that the client should not try the same
 request again.

 474 Outcome Impossible::
 The service determines that the outcome is impossible. For example,
 when the algorithm determines that the subject will have deceased
 before the start of the requested target period.



 [#security]
 == Security Considerations

 * TLS <<RFC5246>> and authenticated HTTP requests should be used to
 protect the DIVINE request and responses due to the personal nature
 of information transmitted.

 * A client *SHOULD* verify the identity of the server on every
 request to prevent impersonation or man-in-the-middle attacks, as data
 transmitted to and from the server is sensitive information, and at
 times critical information to the user.

 * Synchronization of client and server time *MUST* be
 well-considered in the implementation of this specification. A
 mismatch of client and server time *MAY* lead to algorithm
 miscalculations that can cause mistaken choices of a user that depends
 on the reliability of this system.



 [#iana]
 == IANA Considerations
