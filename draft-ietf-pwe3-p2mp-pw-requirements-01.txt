Internet Draft           P2MP PW Requirements               July 2009 
                                     

Abstract 
    
   This document presents a set of requirements for providing an 
   unidirectional Point-to-Multipoint PWE3 (Pseudowire Emulation Edge to 
   Edge) emulation. The requirements identified in this document are 
   related to architecture, signaling and maintenance aspects of a 
   Point-to-Multipoint PW operation. They are proposed as guidelines for 
   the standardization of such mechanisms. Among other potential 
   applications Point-to-Multipoint PWs SHOULD be used to optimize the 
   support of multicast services as defined in the Layer 2 Virtual 
   Private Network working group.

1. Introduction 
    
1.1. Problem Statement 
    
   As defined in the PWE3 WG charter, a Pseudowire (PW) emulates a 
   point-to-point bidirectional link over an IP/MPLS network, and 
   provides a single service which is perceived by its user as an 
   unshared link or circuit of the chosen service. A Pseudowire is used 
   to transport non IP traffic (e.g. Ethernet, TDM, ATM, and FR) in an 
   IP/MPLS-based PSN (Packet Switched Network). PWE3 operates "edge to 
   edge" to provide the required connectivity between the two endpoints 
   of the PW. 
    
   The P2MP topology mentioned in [VPMS REQ] and required to provide 
   P2MP L2VPN services can be achieved via a P2MP PW. The use of PW 
   becomes necessary for some P2MP services requiring specific 
   encapsulation capabilities. This could be achieved using a set of 
   point to point PWs, with traffic replication on the PE, but faces 
   obvious bandwidth limitation issues, as traffic is carried multiple 
   time on shared links.  
    
   This document defines the requirements for the use of a Point-to-
   Multipoint PW (P2MP PW). A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) 
   is a mechanism that emulates the essential attributes of a P2MP 
   Telecommunications service such as P2MP ATM over PSN. One of the 
   applicabilities of a P2MP PW is to deliver a non-IP multicast service 
   that carries multicast frames from a multicast source to one or more 
   multicast receivers. The required functions of P2MP PWs include 
   encapsulating service-specific PDUs arriving at an ingress Attachment 
   Circuit (AC), and carrying them across a tunnel to one or more egress 
   ACs, managing their timing and order, and any other operations 
   required to emulate the behavior and characteristics of the service 
   as faithfully as possible. 
    
   P2MP PWs extend the PWE3 architecture [RFC3985] to offer a P2MP 
   Telecommunications service.

Internet Draft           P2MP PW Requirements               July 2009 
                                     

   This document aims at defining the associated requirements related to 
   the P2MP PW operation (e.g. setup and maintenance, protection, 
   scalability, etc). 
    
    
1.2. Scope of the document 
    
   The document describes the P2MP PW Reference Model architectures and 
   outlines specific signaling requirements for the set up and 
   maintenance of a P2MP PW. The requirements are divided into two 
   parts, i.e. those applicable in a Single-Segment topology and those 
   applicable in a Multi-Segment topology. For other aspects of P2MP PW 
   implementation like packet processing (section 4) and Faithfulness of 
   Emulated Services (section 7), the document refers to [RFC3916].  
    
   Some P2MP PW requirements are derived from the signaling requirements 
   for P2MP Traffic-Engineered MPLS Label Switched Paths [RFC4461].

2.2. Terminology 
    
   This document uses terminology described in [RFC5254], [MS-PW ARCH], 
   [SEG PW]. 
    
   It also introduces additional terms needed in the context of P2MP PW. 
    
   P2MP PW, (also referred as PW Tree) 
    
   Point-to-Multipoint Pseudowire. A PW attached to a source used to 
   distribute L1/L2 format traffic to a set of one or more receivers (or 
   leaves). The P2MP PW is unidirectional. 
    
   P2MP SS-PW 
    
   Point-to-Multipoint Single-Segment Pseudowire. A single segment P2MP 
   PW set up between the PE attached to the source and the PEs attached 
   to the receivers. The P2MP SS-PW relies on a P2MP LSP as PSN tunnel.

   P2MP MS-PW 
    
   Point-to-Multipoint Multi-Segment Pseudowire. A multi-segment P2MP PW 
   represents an End-to-End PW segmented by means of S-PEs which are in 
   charge of switching the PW label. Each segment can rely on either  
   P2P LSP or a P2MP LSP as PSN tunnel.  
      
   Ingress PE 
    
   P2MP PW Ingress Provider Edge. Router attached to a Customer 
   Equipment (traffic source) via an Attachment Circuit (AC). In a MS-PW 
   architecture the term used is Ingress T-PE. 
    
   Egress PE 
    
   P2MP PW Egress Provider Edge. Router attached to a set of on or more 
   Customer Equipments (traffic receivers or leaves) via a set of one or 
   more Attachment Circuits (AC). In a MS-PW architecture the term used 
   is Egress T-PE. 
    
   Branch S-PE 
    
   The branch S-PE is only defined and required in the context of MS-PW. 
   The branch S-PE has one upstream PW segment and one or several 
   downstream PW segments. 
    
   P2MP PSN Tunnel 
    
   In the P2MP SS-PW topology, The PSN Tunnel is a general term 
   indicating a virtual P2MP connection between the Ingress PE and the 
   Egress PEs. A P2MP tunnel may potentially carry multiple P2MP PWs 
   inside. This document uses terminology from the document describing 
   the MPLS multicast architecture [RFC5332] for MPLS PSN. 
    
3. P2MP SS-PW Requirements 
    
3.1. P2MP SS-PW Reference Model 
    
   A P2MP SS-PW provides a Point-to-Multipoint connectivity from an 
   Ingress PE connected to a traffic source to at least two Egress PEs 
   connected to traffic receivers. The PW endpoints connect the PW to 
   its attachment circuits (AC). As for a P2P PW, an AC can be a Frame 
   Relay DLC, an ATM VP/VC, an Ethernet port, a VLAN, a HDLC link on a 
   physical interface.  
    
    
   Figure 1 describes the P2MP SS-PW reference model which is derived 
   from [RFC3985] to support P2MP emulated services.

                    Figure 1 P2MP SS-PW Reference Model 
                                      
   This architecture applies to the case where a P2MP PSN tunnel extends 
   between edge nodes of a single PSN domain to transport a 
   unidirectional P2MP PW with endpoints at these edge nodes. 
   In this model a single copy of each PW packet is sent over the P2MP 
   PSN tunnel and is received by all Egress PEs due to the P2MP nature 
   of the PSN tunnel. P2MP PW MUST be traffic optimised, only one copy 
   of P2MP PW packet on one single link. P Router is joining P2MP PSN 
   tunnel operation but is not participating in the signaling of P2MP 
   PW. P2MP PW operation is associated with PE1, PE2, PE3 and PE4. 
   An AC attached to P2MP PW MUST be configured as "sender" or 
   "receiver" not both.  Any AC is associated with the role of either 
   sending side (Tx) or receiving side (Rx) from the view of CE.  Thus 
   every AC deals with unidirectional traffic. In Figure 1, AC1 is 
   configured as sending sides while AC2, AC3, AC4, AC5 and AC6 are as 
   receiving sides. 
    
   Referring to Figure 1, CE2, CE5 and CE6 MAY want to receive multicast 
   traffic from CE1. P2MP SS-PW (and P2MP MS-PW outlined in section 4) 
   solution MUST support such an operational case where one or more ACs 
   are connected to the same PE and local replication is needed. A PE 
   providing P2MP PW MUST support the following functions: 
   - Ingress PE  MUST support traffic replication over its directly 
   connected ACs toward receiver CEs if necessary, in addition to PSN 
   transport. 
   - Egress PE MUST support traffic replication over its directly 
   connected ACs toward receiver CEs if necessary.

Internet Draft           P2MP PW Requirements               July 2009 
                                     

   In the simplest case one AC serves one P2MP PW, but one AC MUST be 
   able to serve multiple P2MP PW for PW tree redundancy (see section 
   3.6 or for multitree-based VPMS [VPMS REQ]. 
    
   In nature the P2MP PW is unidirectional, but it may be required for 
   an ingress PE to receive unidirectional P2P traffic from any egress 
   PE. For that purpose the P2MP PW MUST also support OPTIONAL 
   bidirectional connectivity between the Ingress PE and each Egress PE 
   - Downstream: Point-to-Multipoint (Ingress PE to any Egress PE) 
   - Upstream: Point-to-Point (any Egress PE to Ingress PE) 
    
3.2. P2MP SS-PW Underlying Layer 
    
   The P2MP SS-PW implies an underlying P2MP PSN tunnel. Figure 2 gives 
   an example of P2MP SS-PW topology relying on a P2MP LSP. The PW tree 
   is composed of one Ingress PE (i1) and several Egress PEs (e1, e2, 
   e3, e4).   
    
   The P2MP PSN MAY be signaled with P2MP RSVP-TE [RFC4875] or MLDP 
   [MLDP].

         Figure 2 Example of P2MP Underlying Layer for P2MP SS-PW 
    
    
   The P2MP PW MAY be supported over multiple P2MP PSN tunnel. These 
   P2MP PSN tunnels MUST be able to serve more than one P2MP PW. 
    
   The P2MP Tunnels MAY also be of different technology ( ex. MPLS over 
   GRE, or P-to-MP MPLS LSP ) or just use different setup protocols. ( 
   ex. MLDP, and P2MP RSVP-TE ). 
    
3.3. P2MP SS-PW Construction 
    
   As initial step PE nodes have to be configured with P2MP PW 
   identifier and ACs. 
   Then discovery mechanism SHOULD allow PE to discover remote PEs 
   configuration. 
   Eventually the solution SHOULD allow single-sided operation at the 
   Ingress PE for the selection of some AC(s) at the Egress PE(s) to be 
   attached to the PW tree so that the Ingress PE controls the leaf

Internet Draft           P2MP PW Requirements               July 2009 
                                     

   Note that the Ingress PE single sided operation is a management 
   requirement and does not presume any signaling requirement. 
    
   The Ingress PE SHOULD support a method to be informed about the 
   Egress PE successfully attached to the PW tree. 
    
    
    
3.4. P2MP SS-PW Signaling Requirements 
    
3.4.1. PW Identifier 
    
   The P2MP PW MUST be uniquely identified. This unique P2MP PW 
   identifier MUST be used for all the signaling procedure related to 
   this PW (PW setup, monitoring). 
    
3.4.2. PW type mismatch 
    
   As for P2P PW, the ACs configured at Ingress PE and Egress PEs of a 
   P2MP PW MUST be of the same PW type [RFC4446]. In case of a different 
   type, the passive PE (Ingress or Egress PE, depending on the 
   signaling process) MUST support mechanisms to reject attempts to 
   establish the P2MP PW. 
 
3.4.3. Interface Parameters sub-TLV 
    
   Some interface parameters [RFC4446] related to the AC capability have 
   been defined according to the PW type and are signaled during the PW 
   setup. 
   When applicable, this mechanism used for the P2P PW setup MUST be 
   enhanced for P2MP PW setup so as to ascertain that AC at the Egress 
   PE is capable to support traffic coming from AC at the Ingress PE.  
    
   In case of mismatch, the passive PE (Ingress or Egress PE, depending 
   on the signaling process) MUST support mechanisms to reject attempts 
   to establish the P2MP SS-PW. 
    
    
3.4.4. Leaf Grafting/Pruning 
    
   Once the PW tree is setup, the solution MUST allow the addition or 
   removal of a leaf, or a subset of leaves to/from the existing tree, 
   without any impact on the PW tree (data and control planes) for the 
   remaining leaves.  
   The addition or removal of a leaf MUST also allow to the P2MP PSN 
   tunnel to be updated accordingly. This MAY cause P2MP PSN tunnel to 
   add or remove the corresponding leaf.

3.5. Failure Detection and Reporting 
    
   Since the underlying layer has an End-to-End P2MP topology between 
   the Ingress PE and the Egress PEs, the failure reporting and 
   processing procedures are implemented only on the edge nodes. 
    
   Failure events MAY cause one or more Egress PEs and associated leaves 
   to become detached from the PW tree. These events MUST be reported to 
   the Ingress PE, using appropriate out-band OAM messages.  
   The solution SHOULD allow the Ingress PE to be informed of Egress PEs 
   and associated leaves failure for management purposes. 
    
   Based on these failure notifications the solution MUST allow the 
   Ingress PE to update the remaining leaves of the PW tree. 
    
   - A solution MUST support in-band OAM mechanism to detect failures: 
   unidirectional point-to-multipoint traffic failure. This SHOULD be 
   realized by enhancing existing unicast PW methods, such as VCCV for 
   seamless and familiar operation. 
    
   - In case of failure, it SHOULD correctly report which Egress PEs are 
   affected. This SHOULD be realized by enhancing existing PW methods, 
   such as LDP Notification for seamless and familiar operation. The 
   notification message SHOULD include the type of fault (P2MP PW, AC or 
   PSN tunnel). 
    
   - Respectively an Egress PE also MAY receive the status of the 
   Ingress PE's AC status. 
    
   - A solution MUST support OAM message mapping at the Ingress PE if 
   failure is detected on the AC. The Egress PE MUST report accordingly 
   at the service layer this OAM message on its associated AC.  
    
    
3.6. Protection and Restoration 
    
   It is assumed that if recovery procedures are required the P2MP PSN 
   tunnel will support standard MPLS-based recovery techniques 
   (typically based on RSVP-TE). In that case a mechanism SHOULD be 
   implemented to avoid race conditions between recovery at the PSN 
   level and recovery at the PW level. 
    
   An alternative protection scheme MAY rely on the PW layer. 
    
     
   Egress PEs MAY be protected via a P2MP PW redundancy mechanism. In 
   the example depicted below, a standby P2MP PW is used to protect the 
   active P2MP. In that protection scheme the AC at the Ingress PE MUST 
   serve both P2MP PWs. In this scenario, the condition when to do the 
   switchover should be implemented, e.g. one or all leaf failure of 
   active P2MP PW will course P2MP PW switchover.

3.7. Scalability 
    
   The solution SHOULD scale at least as well as linearly with an 
   increase in the number of Egress PEs.  
    
   An increase in the number of P2MP PW SHOULD not cause the P router to 
   increase its forwarding table linearly.  
    
   The P2MP PW multiplexed/demultiplexed to P2MP PSN Tunnel can improve 
   the scalability.

Internet Draft           P2MP PW Requirements               July 2009 
                                     

   Figure 3 extends the P2MP SS-PW architecture of Figure 1 to a multi-
   segment configuration. In a P2P MS-PW configuration as described in 
   [RFC5254] the S-PE is responsible to switch a MS-PW from one input 
   segment to only one output segment, based on the PW identifier. Here 
   in a P2MP MS-PW configuration the S-PE is responsible to switch a MS-
   PW from one input segment to one or several output segments.  
    
   Referring to Figure 3 T-PE1 is the Ingress T-PE and T-PE2, T-PE3, T-
   PE4 and T-PE5 are the Egress T-PEs. In the reference model, the 
   Egress T-PEs are assumed to be located in the same PSN (PSN2), but it 
   could be envisioned that each output PW is located in a different PSN 
   (PSN2, PSN3, PSN4). The S-PE plays the role of branch S-PE since it 
   is in charge of switching simultaneously the input PW1 segment to the 
   output PW2, PW3, PW4 segments.  
    
   Referring to Figure 3, CE2, CE3, CE7 and CE8 MAY want to receive 
   multicast traffic from CE1. P2MP MS-PW solution MUST support such an 
   operational case where one or more ACs are connected to the same PE 
   and local replication is needed. A PE providing P2MP PW MUST support 
   the following functions: 
   - S-PE MUST support traffic replication over its directly connected 
   ACs toward receiver CEs if necessary, acting therefore as Egress T-
   PE.  
   - Ingress T-PE  MUST support traffic replication over its directly 
   connected ACs toward receiver CEs if necessary, in addition to PSN 
   transport. 
   - Egress T-E MUST support traffic replication over its directly 
   connected ACs toward receiver CEs if necessary.  
    
    
   A P2MP MS-PW MAY obviously transit through more than one S-PE along 
   its path. 
    
   A P2MP MS-PW, PW segment, can also be supported over a P2MP PSN 
   tunnel or a P2P PSN tunnel. 
    
4.2. P2MP SS-PW Underlying Layer 
    
   Figure 4 describes an example of P2MP MS-PW topology relying on a 
   combination of both P2P and P2MP LSPs as PSN tunnels. PW segment over 
   P2P LSP MAY address inter-provider requirement. The PW tree is 
   composed of one Ingress PE (i1) and several Egress PEs (e1, e2, e3, 
   e4). The branch S-PEs are represented as b1, b2, b3, b4, b5. In that 
   case the traffic replication along the path of the PW tree is 
   performed at the PW level. For instance the branch S-PE b5 MUST 
   replicate incoming packets or data received from b2 and send them to 
   Egress T-PEs e3 and e4. 
    
   However giving the fact that some PW segments MAY be supported over a 
   P2MP LSP, the traffic replication along the path of these PW segments 
   can be performed as well at the underlying LSP level.

   Figure 4 describes the case where each segment is supported over a 
   P2P LSP except for the b1-b3 and b1-b4 segments which are conveyed 
   over a P2MP LSP on this section.

   The P2MP PSN MAY be signaled with P2MP RSVP-TE [RFC4875] or MLDP 
   [MLDP]. 
    
    
4.3. P2MP MS-PW Signaling Requirements 
    
4.3.1. Dynamically Instantiated P2MP MS-PW 
    
   The PW tree could be statically configured at the T-PEs and each S-PE 
   crossed. However it is RECOMMENDED that a solution provides the 
   ability to dynamically setup a MS-PW tree, by allowing the MS-PW 
   segments to be dynamically discovered. 
    
   During the PW tree setup, a branch S-PE SHOULD be capable to inform 
   the upstream PEs, including the Ingress T-PE that a set of Egress T-
   PEs and associated leaves are not reachable.  
    
    
4.3.2. P2MP MS-PW Setup Mechanisms 
    
   The requirements described in this section assume that dynamic setup 
   of MS-PW segments allows the T-PE and S-PEs to dynamically signal MS-
   PW segments and stitch these segments in order to build the MS-PW 
   tree. 
    
    
4.3.3. PW type mismatch 
    
   As described for P2MP SS-PW, the P2MP MS-PW requires ACs of the same 
   PW type. Therefore the segments composing the P2MP MS-PW MUST be also 
   of the same PW type [RFC4446]. The S-PE MAY only support switching

   PWs of the same PW type. In case of a different type, the passive PE 
   (S-PE or T-PE) MUST support mechanisms to reject attempts to 
   establish the P2MP MS-PW. 
    
    
4.3.4. Interface Parameters sub-TLV 
    
   The section 3.4.2 is also relevant to P2MP MS-PW. When applicable, 
   the Egress T-PE or the Ingress T-PE MUST signal respectively its AC' 
   interface parameters to the Ingress T-PE or to the Egress T-PE so as 
   to make sure that AC at the Egress T-PE is capable to support traffic 
   coming from AC at the Ingress T-PE. In the P2MP MS-PW case, S-PEs 
   MUST propagate correctly this information.  
   In case of mismatch, the passive T-PE (Ingress or Egress T-PE, 
   depending on the signaling process) MUST support mechanisms to reject 
   attempts to establish the P2MP MS-PW. 
    
    
4.3.5. Leaf Grafting/Pruning 
    
   Once the PW tree is setup, the solution MUST allow the addition or 
   removal of a leaf, or a subset of leaves to/from the existing tree, 
   without any impact on the PW tree (data and control planes) for the 
   remaining leaves. 
    
4.3.6. Explicit Routing 
    
   The P2MP MS-PW signaling solution MUST provide a means of 
   establishing arbitrary P2MP MS-PW, according to pre-computed and 
   configured S-PE paths as well as dynamically computed S-PE paths on 
   the Ingress PE.   
      
   To support setup of explicitly routed MS-PW tree, the signaling 
   solution SHOULD support some source-based control that can explicitly 
   define particular S-PE nodes as branch S-PEs for the PW tree. 
    
   The solution SHOULD let possible Explicit Path Loose Hops (to be 
   defined). Therefore the P2MP MS-PW MAY be partially specified with 
   only a subset of intermediate branch S-PEs. 
    
    
4.4. Failure Detection and Reporting 
    
   The solution SHOULD rely on specific OAM mechanisms to detect a node 
   (T-PE and S-PE) or segment failure of a PW tree. The solution SHOULD 
   also support the ability to inform the Ingress T-PE of the failure as 
   well as to indicate the identity of affected Egress T-PEs and 
   associated leaves. 
    
   Based on these failure notifications the solution MUST allow the 
   Ingress T-PE to update the remaining Egress PEs and associated leaves 
   of the PW tree.

Internet Draft           P2MP PW Requirements               July 2009 
                                     

    
   - A solution MUST support in-band OAM mechanism to detect failures: 
   unidirectional point-to-multipoint traffic failure. This SHOULD be 
   realized by enhancing existing unicast PW methods, such as VCCV for 
   seamless and familiar operation. 
    
   - In case of failure, it SHOULD correctly report which Egress T-PEs 
   and branch S-PEs are affected. This SHOULD be realized by enhancing 
   existing unicast PW methods, such as LDP Notification for seamless 
   and familiar operation. The notification message SHOULD include the 
   type of fault (P2MP PW, AC or PSN tunnel). 
    
   - A solution MAY support OAM message mapping at T-PE if failure 
   happens i.e., mapping between AC service OAM and P2MP PW OAM. (Need 
   more discussion: in particular, when upstream T-PE AC fails, it can 
   be mapped to all downstream connection. Meanwhile downstream T-PE AC 
   failure does not impose other T-PEs AC.) 
    
    
4.5. Protection and Restoration 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide mechanisms to recover as fast as possible 
   following a failure event. The fast protection/recovery is typically 
   dedicated to P2MP applications sensitive to traffic disruption.   
    
   Considering (i) a source-initiated PW tree setup and (ii) that a 
   local repair (PSN-tunnel or PW segment-based) is not feasible after a 
   failure event and that (iii) the PE upstream to the failure receives 
   by means of OAM mechanisms a message indicating that a subset of 
   Egress T-PEs are detached from the PW tree, the solution SHOULD allow 
   the upstream PE to re-compute the path to those particular Egress T-
   PEs. If the upstream PE failed to compute an alternative path, the 
   procedure SHOULD be propagated upstream until the Ingress-PE is 
   reached. 
    
   It is also assumed that recovery procedures can be implemented at the 
   underlying P2P or P2MP LSP layer, using standard MPLS-based recovery 
   techniques. These procedures could be used to provide faster recovery 
   time in case of link or node failure affecting this layer. 
    
   A mechanism SHOULD be implemented to avoid race conditions between 
   recovery at the PSN level and recovery at the PW level. 
    
    
4.6. Scalability 
    
   In definition of solution for P2MP MS-PW a particular attention MUST 
   be dedicated to scalability. 
    
   The solution MUST be designed to scale as well as linearly with an 
   increase in the number of leaves, Egress T-PEs, branch S-PEs. The 
   scalability issues MUST be addressed for the control plane (e.g.

   addressing of PW endpoints, number of signaling sessions, etc) and 
   for data plane (e.g. duplication of PW segments, OAM mechanism, etc). 
    
    
4.7. Order of Magnitude 
    
   This section will be filled in a future version. 
    
   Number of Egress T-PE per tree, TAII per Egress T-PE, S-PE crossed, 
   replication supported per S-PE, dynamicity (Leaf Grafting/Pruning) 
   required, etc. 
    
    
5. Manageability considerations 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide a simple provisioning procedure to build 
   a P2MP SS-PW or a P2MP MS-PW.  
    
   The solution MUST take into consideration the situation where the 
   Ingress PE and Egress PEs are not managed by a single NMS.  
    
   In that case it MUST be possible to manage the whole P2MP PW using a 
   single NMS. Typically the P2MP PW could be managed from the Ingress 
   PE. 
    
    
6. Backward Compatibility 
    
    
   The solution SHOULD be completely backward compatible with 
   the current PW standards. The solution SHOULD take into account the 
   capability advertisement and negotiation procedures for the PEs 
   implementing P2MP PW endpoints. 
    
   Implementation of OAM mechanisms also implies the advertisement of PE 
   capabilities to support specific OAM features. The solution MAY allow 
   advertising P2MP PW OAM capabilities. 
    
    
   A solution MUST NOT allow PW connection with non-compliant PEs.  It 
   MUST have a mechanism to report an error for non-compliant PEs.  In 
   this case, it SHOULD report which PE (S-PE and T-PEs) are not 
   compliant.  
    
   In some cases, upstream traffic is required from downstream CE to 
   upstream CE. 
   A solution SHOULD allow co-existing operation with point-to-point PW 
   that provides upstream connection. 
   In particular, it is expected to be allowed that the same ACs are 
   shared between downstream and upstream direction. For downstream, a 
   CE receives from its connected AC traffic originated by the ingress 
   PE transported over a P2MP PW.  For upstream, the CE MAY also send

   over the same AC traffic destined to the same remote PE transported 
   over point-to-point PW. 
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   This section will be added in a future version. 
    
8. IANA Considerations 
    
   This draft does not define any new protocol element, and hence does 
   not require any IANA action.
