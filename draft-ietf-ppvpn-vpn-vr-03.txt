Abstract 
    
   This draft describes a network-based VPN architecture using virtual 
   routers. The VPN service is built based on the virtual router (VR) 
   concept, which has exactly the same mechanisms as a physical router, 
   and therefore inherits all existing mechanisms and tools for 
   configuration, operation, accounting, and maintenance. Within a VPN 
   domain, an instance of routing is used to distribute VPN 
   reachability information among VR routers. Any routing protocol can 
   be used, and no VPN-related modifications or extensions are needed 
   to the routing protocol for achieving VPN reachability. Virtual 
   routers can be deployed in different VPN configurations, direct VR 
   to VR connectivity through layer-2 or by aggregating multiple VRs 
   into a single VR combined with IP or MPLS based tunnels. This 
   architecture accommodates various backbone deployment scenarios, 
   both where the VPN service provider owns the backbone, and where the 
   VPN service provider obtains backbone service from one or more other 
   service providers.  
 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in

1. Introduction 
 
   Several solutions have been put forward to achieve various levels of 
   network privacy and traffic isolation when building VPNs across a 
   shared IP backbone. Most of these solutions require separate per-VPN 
   forwarding capabilities and make use of IP- or MPLS-based tunnels 
   across the backbone [VPN-RFC2764], [RFC-2917], and [VPN-RFC2547bis].  
    
   This document describes a network-based VPN architecture using 
   virtual routers. The architecture complies with the IP VPN framework 
   described in [VPN-RFC2764]. The objective is to provide per-VPN 
   routing, forwarding, quality of service, and service management 
   capabilities. The VPN service is based on the virtual router 
   concept, which has exactly the same mechanisms as a physical router, 
   and therefore can inherit all existing mechanisms and tools for 
   configuration, deployment, operation, troubleshooting, monitoring, 
   and accounting. Virtual routers can be deployed in various VPN 
   configurations. Direct VR to VR connectivity may be configured 
   through layer-2 links or through a variety of tunnel mechanisms, 
   using IP- or MPLS-based tunnels. Multiple VRs may be aggregated over 
   a "backbone VR." This architecture accommodates various backbone 
   deployment scenarios, including where the VPN service provider owns 
   the backbone, and where the VPN service provider obtains backbone 
   service from one or more other service providers.  
    
   Within a VPN domain, an instance of routing is used to distribute 
   VPN reachability information among VR routers. Any routing protocol 
   can be used, and no VPN-related modifications or extensions are 
   needed to the routing protocol for achieving VPN reachability. VPN 
   reachability information to and from customer sites can be 
   dynamically learned from the CE using standard routing protocols, or 
   it can be statically provisioned on the VR. The routing protocol

   between the virtual routers and CEs is independent of the routing 
   used in the VPN backbone, between the VRs. That is, the routing 
   protocol between the VRs may be the same or it might be different 
   than the routing mechanism used between the CE and VR. Likewise, 
   since the VR-to-VR connectivity can use tunnels, the inter-VR 
   routing protocol can be independent of the routing used in the 
   backbone network(s) over which the VR-based VPN runs. 
    
   There are two fundamental architectures for implementing network-
   based VPNs: virtual routers (VR) and piggybacking. The main 
   difference between the two architectures resides in the model used 
   to achieve VPN reachability and membership functions. In the VR 
   model, each VR in the VPN domain is running an instance of routing 
   protocol responsible for disseminating VPN reachability information 
   between VRs. Therefore, VPN membership and VPN reachability are 
   treated as separate functions, and separate mechanisms are used to 
   implement these functions. VPN reachability is carried out by a per-
   VPN instance of routing, and a range of mechanisms is possible for 
   determining membership (see section 6.0). In the piggyback model the 
   VPN network layer is terminated at the edge of the backbone, and a 
   backbone routing protocol (i.e., extended BGP-4) is responsible for 
   disseminating the VPN membership and reachability information 
   between provider edge routers (PE) for all the VPNs configured on 
   the PE. [VPN-RFC2547bis] is an example of a piggyback VPN 
   architecture. 
    
2. Virtual Router Architecture Requirements 
    
2.1 Membership 
    
   All virtual routers that are members of a specific VPN MUST share 
   the same VPN identifier (VPN-ID). This should be the Globally Unique 
   Identifier (GID) defined in [VPN-GID] or the VPN-ID format defined 
   in [VPN-RFC2685].  
    
2.2 Scalability 
    
   In this architecture, the backbone internal nodes (e.g., P devices) 
   are not required to be VPN aware or VR aware, and therefore they 
   don't keep any VPN state within the backbone. Thus the VR 
   architecture is not a significant contributor to issues of backbone 
   scalability.  
    
   The PE on which the VRs run (and the VRs themselves) should be able 
   to accommodate rapid growth in the number of routes per VR, since 
   this number can change suddenly as membership changes. The PE should 
   be able to accommodate substantial growth in the number of VRs and 
   CEs supported, to avoid reconfiguration that can disrupt existing 
   connectivity. The use of the "backbone VR" (Section 5.3) improves 
   the scalability of the PE, since many VRs on the PE may use the 
   backbone VR for connectivity to other VPN sites.

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpn-vr-03.txt      January 2003 
 
2.3 Quality of Service 
    
   Existing quality of service mechanisms developed for physical 
   routers should all be available to be used on a per-VR basis. 
   Therefore, quality of service (policing, shaping, classification, 
   and scheduling) SHOULD be configurable on a per-VPN basis. 
     
2.4 Auto-discovery 
    
   It should be possible for the VRs to automatically discover each 
   other, set up tunnels to each other, and exchange private routing 
   information across the backbone. It is required that the auto-
   discovery mechanism take into consideration the case where the VPNs 
   are implemented across administrative domains. We assume in this 
   document that an auto-discovery mechanism which provides services 
   similar to BGP (as described in [VPN-BGP]) is used as the mechanism 
   to distribute membership, topology, and tunnel information among VRs 
   which are members of the same VPN. 
    
2.5 Routing 
    
2.5.1 Routing between PE and CE 
    
   Any existing routing protocol can be used between PE and the CE. 
   Typically, the routing protocol of the specific VPN site will be 
   used. Static routes may be used. The routing protocol between the PE 
   and the CE can be independent of the PE-to-PE routing. 
    
2.5.2 Routing in the Service Provider Network (Backbone) 
    
   The choice of the backbone routing protocol should not be 
   constrained by the VPNs.  
    
2.5.3 Routing between PEs 
    
   Any existing routing protocol can be used between PEs. The routing 
   protocol between the PEs can be independent of the CE-to-PE routing. 
   As with any network design, care must be taken when multiple routing 
   protocols are used, due to differences in metrics, detail of 
   information, etc. 
    
2.6 Security 
    
   The architecture MUST accommodate different levels of security for 
   data, routing, and other control information. The architecture must 
   provide authentication and encryption services for VPNs requiring 
   strong security capabilities. 
    
2.7 Topology 
    
   VPN topologies such as a hub and spoke, and full mesh MUST be 
   supported. It should be possible to build arbitrary VPN topologies.  
 
Ould-Brahim, et al.            July 2002                     [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpn-vr-03.txt      January 2003 
 
    
   For example, in the case where the internal nodes (P devices) are 
   also VR aware (NOTE this is not required - see section 2.2) then it 
   is possible to have either tunnels from the PE or the CE connecting 
   to these internal VRs. This type of VPN deployment can be useful 
   when the internal nodes are geographically suitable to be a VPN hub.  
    
2.8 Tunneling 
    
   The architecture should not be limited to a single tunneling 
   mechanism. It should be possible to use IPSec, GRE, IP in IP, and 
   MPLS tunnels. It should also be possible to allow multiple VPNs to 
   share a tunnel across a backbone.  Therefore within a single VPN, 
   different types of tunnels can be used. 
    
2.9 Management 
 
   It should be easy to configure, deploy, operate and troubleshoot 
   each VPN independently, using existing mechanisms and tools. Tools 
   used for operating, managing and debugging IP networks can continue 
   to be used without any modification. 
    
   Most aspects of the management of the multiple VRs on the PE by the 
   Service Provider are implementation-specific, and beyond the scope 
   of this document. 
    
2.10 General Requirements 
    
   The followings are some general requirements for the VR 
   architecture: 
   1) The architecture should accommodate different sizes of VPNs, and 
     one VPN should not impact other VPNs on the PE.  
   2) The architecture MUST support overlapping VPN address spaces in 
     separate VPNs. 
   3) The architecture should support direct paths between VPN sites 
     that bypass the service provider backbone (backdoor links). 
     Traffic can be directed to the backdoor link, or injected to the 
     backbone with the flexibility of using both the backbone access, 
     and the backdoor link as internal or external paths. 
   4) The architecture MUST work over different deployment scenarios, 
     e.g. where the service provider owns its own backbone, and where 
     the service provider obtains backbone service from one or more 
     other service providers. 
 
3. Network Reference Model 
    
   A VPN customer site is connected to the provider backbone by means 
   of a connection between a Customer Edge (CE) device, (which can be a 
   bridge or a router) and a virtual router (VR). CE devices are 
   preconfigured to connect to one or more VRs.Multiple VRs 
   may coexist on the same service provider edge device (PE).

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpn-vr-03.txt      January 2003 
 
   CE devices can be attached to VRs over any type of access link (e.g. 
   ATM, frame relay, ethernet, PPP or IP tunneling mechanism such as 
   IPSec, L2TP or GRE tunnels).

                Figure 1: Network Reference Model 
 
   CE sites can be statically connected to the provider network via 
   dedicated circuits, or can use dial-up links. Routing tables 
   associated with each virtual router define the site-to-site 
   reachability for each VPN. The internal backbone provider routers 
   (P) are not VPN aware and do not keep VPN state. 
 
3.1 Backbone 
    
   In general the backbone is a shared network infrastructure, which 
   represents either: 
   1) A layer-2 ATM or frame relay network. 
   2) An IP network.  
   3) An MPLS network. 
    
   Not all VPNs existing on the same PE are necessarily connected to 
   the same backbone. A single VPN can be built from multiple transport 
   technologies.  
 
4. Virtual Router Definition 
    
   A virtual router (VR) is an emulation of a physical router at the 
   software and/or hardware levels. Virtual routers have independent IP 
   routing and forwarding tables and they are isolated from each other. 
   This means that a VPN's address space can overlap with another VPN's 
   address space. The addresses need only be unique within a VPN 
   domain. 
    
   A virtual router has two main functions: 
   1) Constructing routing tables for the paths between VPN sites using 
     any routing technologies (e.g., static, OSPF, RIP, or BGP). 
   2) Forwarding packets to the next hops within the VPN domain. 
    
   From the VPN user point of view, a virtual router provides the same 
   functionality as a physical router. Separate routing, and forwarding 
 
Ould-Brahim, et al.            July 2002                     [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpn-vr-03.txt      January 2003 
 
   capabilities provide each VR with the appearance of a dedicated 
   router that guarantees isolation from the traffic of other VPNs, 
   while running on shared forwarding and transmission resources. 
    
   Virtual routers belonging to the same VPN domain must have the same 
   Virtual Private Network Identifier (VPN-ID). Examples of VPN-ID 
   formats are described in [VPN-RFC2685] and [VPN-GID]. To the CE 
   access device, the virtual router appears as a neighbor router in 
   the CE based network. The CE sends all traffic for non-local VPN 
   destinations to the VR, unless the specific VPN topology provides 
   alternate routes. Each CE access device must learn the set of 
   destinations reachable through its connection to the virtual router; 
   this may be as simple as a default route. Virtual routers 
   participating in a single VPN domain are responsible for learning 
   and disseminating VPN reachability information among themselves. A 
   given VR holds the routes only for the specific VPN configured for 
   that VR. Any routing protocol can be used between the VRs and the 
   CEs.  
    
5. How VPNs are built and deployed using VRs 
    
   Three main VR deployment scenarios can be used for building virtual 
   private networks: 
   1) VR to VR connectivity over a layer 2 connection. 
   2) VR to VR connectivity tunneled over an IP or MPLS network. 
   3) Aggregating multiple virtual routers over a "backbone virtual 
     router," which will provide connectivity over a layer 2, IP, or 
     MPLS network. 
    
   The above VR deployment scenarios can coexist on a single PE and 
   they are not mutually exclusive.  
    
5.1 VR to VR Connectivity over Layer 2 Connections 
    
   As illustrated in figure 2, virtual routers can be deployed over 
   direct layer-2 frame relay or ATM connections or other layer-2 
   transport technology.

   engineering on a per-VPN connection basis. The connections can be 
   statically configured or dynamically established. 
    
5.2 VR to VR Connectivity through IP or MPLS tunnels  
 
   Virtual routers can connect over an IP or MPLS backbone. In a manner 
   analogous to layer-2 transport, they can use the backbone to support 
   tunneled connections among the VRs. The topology can be described 
   similar to that for layer-2 transport, as in figure 2. 
    
   Although it is clearly possible to use a topology similar to the 
   layer-2 model over an IP or MPLS backbone, the VR capability can 
   support a different network deployment besides full mesh tunnels 
   between VRs. This is the creation (on each PE) of another VR facing 
   into the backbone network, which is used to build a kind of backbone 
   VPN that may be shared among multiple customer VPNs. This is 
   described below as the "backbone VR." 
 
5.3 Virtual Router Backbone Aggregation 
    
   Another typical VPN configuration consists of connecting multiple 
   virtual routers to the backbone through the use of a single virtual 
   router (figure 3). For easy reference in the following sections we 
   call this single virtual router "the backbone virtual router" or 
   "the backbone VR". 
    
   The backbone virtual router is not functionally different than other 
   virtual routers.  It is only a virtual router that is configured and 
   deployed in a special configuration.

               Figure 3: VR-1 and VR-2 used as backbone VRs 
 
   The backbone virtual router connects each PE to a shared backbone 
   infrastructure. Backbone virtual routers can be deployed over ATM, 
   FR, IP, or MPLS networks. Since the backbone VR allows the 
   aggregation of VRs from multiple VPNs, backbone configuration can

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpn-vr-03.txt      January 2003 
 
   remain unaffected as new VPNs or VPN sites are added. The 
   relationship between the VRs and the backbone VR is an overlay 
   relationship.  
    
   Note that although the concept is described above using a single 
   backbone VR, there may be multiple backbone VRs per PE. 
    
5.3.1 Tunneling 
    
   VPN data and routing information is tunneled through the use of IP 
   or MPLS based tunnels (e.g., IPSec, GRE, IP in IP, MPLS). Depending 
   on the tunnel technology used, the tunnels can be statically 
   configured or dynamically established. The tunnel appears to VRs as 
   a point-to-point link. Traffic sent through the tunnel, and 
   forwarded by the backbone VR is opaque to the underlying backbone 
   technology used.  
    
   A tunnel can be established per VPN or shared among many VPNs (VRs). 
   The tunnel can originate from the backbone virtual router or from 
   the VRs. This can provide an opportunity for service 
   differentiation, in which a service provider can offer a higher 
   level of service (at a higher price point) for individually mapped 
   VPN connections among a customer's VRs. 
    
   The backbone VR makes it appear as if each VR within a VPN is 
   directly connected (full and partial mesh configurations supported).  
   Each VR within the VPN exchanges routing information directly with 
   the other VRs in the VPN.   
    
   VPNs may use different type of tunnels for inter-VR connectivity. 
   Some sites may use MPLS as their tunnel technology of choice. Other 
   sites (which transit through non-secure domains) may choose to use 
   IPSec to encrypt their data. 
    
   The scalability and security of dynamic tunnel establishment between 
   VRs will be enhanced by the ability to exchange a VPN-ID. [VPN-BGP] 
   supports auto-discovery of the VPN-ID within BGP-based networks. 
   Further work is needed to determine the requirements and usage of 
   the VPN-ID exchange within IPsec-based tunneling scenarios. 
    
5.3.1.1 MPLS Tunnels 
    
   MPLS tunneling can be used in different forwarding scenarios. A 
   hierarchy of two labels can be used. One simple forwarding scenario 
   is where the inner label identifies the VR intended to receive the 
   private packet (to be forwarded to the CE). Another forwarding 
   scenario is to distribute the inner label on a per-VPN basis across 
   the tunnel. In this case the label distribution process can be 
   achieved using BGP or an existing label distribution protocol on a 
   per-VPN basis. The inner label relates to the private VPN prefix. 
   The label and reachability distribution is done through the tunnels. 
 
Ould-Brahim, et al.            July 2002                     [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpn-vr-03.txt      January 2003 
 
   On the egress side traffic will be directed to the egress interface 
   by looking up the inner label.  
 
5.3.1.2 IPSec Tunnels 
    
   IPSec is needed when there is a requirement for strong encryption or 
   strong authentication. It also supports multiplexing and a 
   signalling protocol - IKE. IPSec tunnels can be established between 
   two VPN sites across the backbone (originating from the backbone 
   VRs).  
    
5.3.2 Routing 
    
   The backbone VR exchanges backbone routing information with other 
   backbone entities (P routers and possibly other backbone VRs). The 
   backbone routing is separated from the customer VPN routing. 
   Virtual routers can run any routing protocol on their local VPN 
   domain. Both static routes and dynamic routing protocols such as 
   RIP, OSPF, and BGP-4 can be used. VPN sites exchange routing 
   information through the tunnels over the backbone. 
    
   If a backdoor link is used between VPN sites running any IGP, then 
   by adjusting the backdoor link costs appropriately, the backbone 
   link can be favored for forwarding VPN traffic. By lowering the 
   weight, the backdoor link can be used as a backup link in case the 
   backbone path fails.  
 
5.3.3 Relationship between the VRs and the Backbone VR 
    
   The routing domain of a set of VRs participating in a single VPN has 
   no relation to the routing domain of the backbone VR. The backbone 
   VR is not necessarily aware of the routing instances running on each 
   private virtual router. However, because the backbone VR is also a 
   virtual router, it can build routing relationships with other VRs if 
   needed. 
    
5.3.4 Multiple Backbones connected to a single PE 
    
   Figure 4 illustrates an example where multiple backbones are 
   connected to the same PE. This type of configuration can be used 
   when the PE is connected to multiple service provider backbones, or 
   when the service provider offers different VPN services for 
   different types of backbones.

6. VPN Auto-Discovery 
    
   The virtual router approach explicitly separates the mechanisms used 
   for distributing reachability information from mechanisms used for 
   distributing VPN topology and membership information. VPN membership 
   information refers to the set of PEs that have customers in a 
   particular VPN. VPN topology represents the set of PEs and their 
   interconnectivity within the VPN. The topology can be a full-mesh of 
   PEs, a hub and spoke, or anything in between. Dynamic topology can 
   also be handled due to on-demand VPN customers. 
 
   VPN discovery can be achieved through different mechanisms, for 
   example: 
    
   - Directory server approach, in which VRs query a server to 
   determine their neighbors. 
   - Explicit configuration via a management platform. 
   - Piggybacking VPN membership and topology information using 
   existing routing protocols (e.g., BGP) [VPN-BGP].  
   - Other VPN membership and topology auto-discovery approaches. 
 
   The above mechanisms can be combined on a single PE. As an example, 
   for some VPNs topology discovery is done only through a management 
   platform. For others, dynamic topology discovery is achieved using 
   existing routing protocols.  
 
Ould-Brahim, et al.            July 2002                     [Page 12]

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpn-vr-03.txt      January 2003 
 
    
   In this document it is assumed that a mechanism that provides 
   services similar to BGP is used to achieve auto-discovery of VPN 
   members. As described in [VPN-BGP], VR addresses are exchanged, 
   along with the information needed to enable the PEs to determine 
   which VRs are in the same VPN ("membership"), and which of those VRs 
   are to have VPN connectivity ("topology"). Once the VRs are 
   reachable through the tunnels, routes ("reachability") are then 
   exchanged by running existing routing protocols on a per-VPN basis 
   across the tunnels. 
    
   It is important to note that, for the VR architecture, the auto-
   discovery mechanism is only used to automatically exchange VPN 
   control information between VRs. It is not intended for piggybacking 
   VPN private reachability information onto the backbone routing 
   instance, as is done in [VPN-RFC2547bis], for example. 
    
7. VRs and Extranets 
    
   Extranets are commonly used to refer to a scenario whereby two or 
   more companies have network access to a limited amount of each 
   other's corporate data. An important feature of extranets is the 
   control of who can access what data, and this is essentially a 
   policy decision. Policy decisions are enforced at the 
   interconnection points between different domains [VPN-RFC2764]. The 
   enforcement may be done via a firewall, a router with access list 
   functionality, or any device capable of applying policy decisions to 
   transit traffic. 
    
   In the VR architecture, policy can be enforced between two VPNs, or 
   between a VPN and the Internet, in exactly the same manner as is 
   done today without VPNs. For example, two VRs (VPNs) could be 
   interconnected, with each VR locally imposing its own policy 
   controls, via a firewall or other enforcement mechanism, on all 
   traffic that enters its VPN from the outside (whether from another 
   VR or from the Internet). Combining firewalls and exchanging private 
   routes between VRs (members of different VPNs) provide a flexible 
   mechanism to build different flavors of extranets. 
    
8. VPNs across Domains 
    
   It is possible that a VPN may cross multiple domains administered by 
   different service providers. In the VR model, tunnels are used to 
   provide intra-VPN connectivity across the backbones. The main 
   requirement on the service provider in order to achieve end-to-end 
   cross-domain VPN connectivity is the ability for both domains to 
   support a common tunnel technology. Once the tunnel is established, 
   private data (e.g., routing information, and private customer data) 
   can flow from one domain to the other with the same level of 
   security as is provided in a single service provider network. 
   Another possible scenario is to use two virtual routers configured 
   on each PE at the interconnection point. Each VR will use policy 
 
Ould-Brahim, et al.            July 2002                     [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpn-vr-03.txt      January 2003 
 
   decisions and firewalling to control VPN traffic transiting from one 
   domain to the other.  
    
   The ability to use a standard VPN-ID format also allows unambiguous 
   VPN identification across domains.  
    
9. Internet Access 
  
   The same link attaching the CE to the VR can be used to provide 
   Internet access to the VPN sites. The VR operations are decoupled 
   from the mechanisms used by the customer sites to access the 
   Internet. 
    
   There are a number of ways to provide Internet access to a VPN using 
   the VR model. One way of providing VPN Internet access is to 
   configure the backbone VR to steer private traffic to the VPN VR, 
   and Internet traffic to the normal backbone/Internet forwarding 
   table. The backbone VR can hold the Internet routes (so it will not 
   be necessary for the VPN VRs to handle them). Firewalls should be 
   used to secure the access (with the ability to use NAT).  
    
   Other options are also valid. One may want to have a particular VR 
   handling Internet access only (rather than going to the backbone 
   VR), or a default route to an Internet gateway can be used. 
    
10. Carrier's Carrier Case 
    
   It is possible that a VPN service is also a network of a service 
   provider offering VPN services. Different options can be used to 
   implement the VPN hierarchy.  
    
   In one approach, tunnels are built from the VPN edges to the CEs, 
   and the VRs transparently provide VPN service to the remote CEs. 
   This can be useful in the case where the CEs are themselves VRs and 
   the service provider is also outsourcing the management of his 
   customer VPN services.  
    
   Another case is where the remote VPN services are completely 
   transparent to the VRs (on the PEs). This is the default case. It is 
   up to the VPN network to distribute VPN reachability across the CEs.  
    
   Another option is for the VPN service to implement the VR 
   architecture. In this option, the VPN Backbone VRs appear as CEs to 
   the VRs configured on the PEs.  
    
11. Operations and Management 
    
   Each VR operates independently, and can be individually reconfigured 
   without affecting other VRs on the same PE.  In some 
   implementations, it may be possible for a VR to be "rebooted" by a 
   customer without affecting other VRs. In case of PE failure (e.g., 
   migration, upgrades, etc.), the service provider may want to control 
 
Ould-Brahim, et al.            July 2002                     [Page 14]

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpn-vr-03.txt      January 2003 
 
   and decide what VPN services gets reestablished first. This 
   particular point is important when a large number of VPNs is 
   supported on the PE where each VPN service has different service 
   availability requirements.  
    
   Since each VR operates as an independent router, it is possible for 
   the management of the VRs to be outsourced.  VPN customers may 
   choose to configure (or perhaps only to monitor) the VRs that make 
   up their VPN.  It is also possible that the backbone VRs could be 
   managed by a separate entity.  
    
11.1 Backbone Migration 
    
   One benefit in using multiple backbone virtual routers is the 
   ability for the backbone network administrator to migrate its 
   backbone from one core technology to another with minimal disruption 
   to VPN services. Conversely, a VPN configuration change or a VPN-
   software upgrade is totally transparent to the backbone protocol and 
   policies (this is due to decoupling the VPN routing protocol from 
   the provider backbone routing protocol).  
    
11.2 Troubleshooting 
    
   The service provider or the VPN customer can use all existing 
   troubleshooting tools on a per-VPN basis (e.g. ping and traceroute). 
   As an example, a VPN customer may be able to telnet to its own VR 
   and perform some troubleshooting operations. In this particular 
   case, the service provider can configure for each VPN customer 
   restricted privileges over the virtual router associated with the 
   customer VPN network. This access may provide only the privilege to 
   monitor (with no privilege to change) the layer 3 status of the 
   customer's VPN. The service provider may be able to offer VPN 
   customers an SNMP-based method for read-only access to information 
   about their own VPN. However, backbone topology information is 
   completely hidden to the VPN VR, and therefore to the service 
   provider's customer. 
    
12. Quality of Service 
    
   This architecture can utilize a variety of Quality of Service 
   mechanisms. QoS mechanisms developed for physical routers can be 
   used with VRs, on a per-VR basis, including classification, 
   policing, drop policies, traffic shaping and scheduling/bandwidth 
   reservation. The architecture allows separate quality of service 
   engineering of the VPNs and the backbone. 
    
13. Scalability 
    
   Only the PEs are handling the VPN type information. The internal 
   backbone routers (the P routers) are usually not VPN aware. 
   Furthermore, virtual routers allow multiple private CE-based 
   networks to connect to a single PE.  
 
Ould-Brahim, et al.            July 2002                     [Page 15]

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpn-vr-03.txt      January 2003 
 
    
   One advantage of the ability to contain the VPN address space and 
   VPN routing and forwarding capabilities within the virtual router 
   entity is the possibility to distribute PE system resources on a 
   per-VPN basis. Indeed, as an example, different scheduling 
   mechanisms can be used for processing each VPN activity within the 
   PE. This type of per-VPN resource management contributes to 
   establishing a wide range of priority schemes among the VPNs within 
   the PE. 
 
14. Security Considerations 
    
   Various levels of data, routing and configuration security can be 
   implemented. Any existing security-related mechanisms supported by 
   existing routing protocols (e.g. authentication) can be used 
   unmodified in the VR architecture. If IPSec tunneling is used as the 
   tunneling protocol, then both the control and data traffic that 
   travels over the tunnel can be secured; so that routing specific 
   security enhancements are not needed. Any private routing, 
   forwarding and addressing manipulation is done within the virtual 
   router context. Direct layer-2 connections (ATM, FR), or specific 
   tunneling mechanisms can also provide various levels of data 
   security.
