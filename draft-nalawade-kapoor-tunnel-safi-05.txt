Abstract

   There is a growing requirement for network operators to support
   multi-address familiy routing and forwarding services across their
   backbone networks. In general this is accomplished by constructing a
   mesh of tunnels between the backbbone provider edge routers and then
   advertising reachability to prefixes through specific tunnels. This

   document defines a new subsequence address family identifier
   associated with a tunnel end-point information. This enables a single
   egress provider edge router to use the border gateway protocol as a
   scalable and efficient means to distribute its tunnel end-point
   information to many ingress provider edge routers. The result is that
   the mesh of tunnels is in place and packets can be forwarded through
   these tunnels based on advertised reachability.

1. Introduction

   There is a growing requirement for network operators to support
   multi-address familiy routing and forwarding services across their
   backbone networks. In the context of network-based IP VPN, this is
   accomplished today using the mechanisms defined in RFC4364. More
   recently the softwires effort has emerged as a generalized, network-
   based routing and forwarding solution supporting connectivity of
   address familiy islands (e.g. IPv4, IPv6, VPNv4, VPNv6) across a
   uniform IPv4 or IPv6 backbone network [SW-MESH-FMWK]. In both cases
   the establishment of tunnels (IP or MPLS) between ingress and egress
   provider edge (PE) routers must be in place before packets of one
   address famility can be tunneled across the backbone network.

   Two end-points of a tunnel need to agree upon the end-point
   information and its binding to a network address at the remote point.
   Normally, this information can be manually shared and statically
   configured when the number of tunnels to manage is relatively small.
   In the case of a network such as an MPLS VPN where there is a need
   for a tunnel between every ingress and egress PE, the number of
   tunnel end-points that need to be exchanged and maintained grows
   dramatically as the network becomes large.  The egress PE already
   defines reachability information for the private routing information
   as well as the NLRI of the PE itself.  This information is
   distributed via MP-BGP to any number of potential ingress PE.  The
   extent of distribution of egress PE's NLRI and next-hop is unknown by
   the egress PE; therefore, egress PE cannot feasibly know the tunnel
   attributes for any potential ingress PE unless the egress PE assigns
   these attributes.  The egress PE needs to advertise it's capability
   to receive tunneled packets, the types of tunnels supported, the
   preference for the various tunnel methods, and the attributes
   associated with the tunnels.  The tunnel information then needs to be
   distributed and maintained using MP-BGP such that every potential
   ingress PE knows the appropriate tunnel method and attributes of the
   egress PE.  The tunnel capabilities are uniquely defined for a given
   PE and may or may not correlate with the capabilities of any other
   potential ingress PE.  For this reason, the ingress PE may select the
   most appropriate tunneling mechanism based on the compability of the
   tunnel capabilities between the ingress and egress PE's and their
   preferences.

2. The Tunnel SAFI

   This document defines a new BGP SAFI called the Tunnel SAFI.  The
   <AFI, SAFI> [IANA-AFI] [IANA-SAFI] value pair used to identify this
   SAFI are: AFI=1, SAFI=64, for the IPv4 Tunnel address family; and
   AFI=2, SAFI=64 for the IPv6 Tunnel address family.

   For BGP Speakers supporting [BGP-4], the tunnel end point address
   will be carried as an NLRI in the MP_REACH attribute for the Tunnel
   SAFI.

   The NLRI will be encoded as a 2-octet Identifier followed by the NLRI
   format as specified by the respective AFI.  The Identifier will
   identify the tunnel end point being advertised.  This Identifier
   enables multiple tunnels to share the same network address, thus
   conserving the number of addresses needed to be configured by the
   operator on each of the Tunnel-endpoints. The network address
   contained in the Tunnel SAFI NLRI is the network address of the
   tunnel end point.

   The network address contained in the BGP Tunnel SAFI NLRI SHOULD be
   the same as the network address carried in the 'Network Address of
   Next Hop' field of the BGP Softwire Nexthop Attribute [BGP-SW-NEXT-
   HOP]. The BGP Softwire Nexthop Attribute will be carried separately
   in BGP advertisements, as described in [BGP-SW-NEXT-HOP].


3. BGP Encapsulation Attributes

   The BGP Tunnel SAFI will carry the tunnel end-point information
   inside a BGP encapsulation attribute. The encapsulation attribute
   used can be either the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute [BGP-TUN]
   or the BGP Softwire Mesh encapsulation attribute [BGP-SW-ENCAP]. The
   egress PE may support one or more tunnel methods.  The egress PE MUST
   advertise all tunnel types for which it will support tunnel
   termination.  The egress PE MAY advertise one or more tunnel types.

   If a BGP Speaker supports the BGP Tunnel SAFI then it MUST understand
   the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute [BGP-TUN]. A BGP update for the
   Tunnel SAFI MUST contain either the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation
   Attribute [BGP-TUN] or the BGP Softwire Mesh encapsulation attribute
   [BGP-SW-ENCAP].  A BGP update for the Tunnel SAFI MUST NOT contain
   both the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute [BGP-TUN] and the BGP
   Softwire Mesh encapsulation attribute [BGP-SW-ENCAP] in the same
   update message. If such an update message is received by a BGP
   speaker, the message should be ignored.

   The details of the contents of the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute

   [BGP-TUN] are described in the section below.

3.1 Contents of BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attrubite.

   As defined in [BGP-TUN], the first bit of the TYPE field in the BGP
   Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute is the 'transitive bit'. If the bit
   value is 1, implies that this tunnel is transitive. If the bit value
   is 0, it implies this specific tunnel is not transitive.

   The Value Field of the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute, MUST
   contain at least one of the following valid Type codes for this SAFI.
   It MAY contain one or more TLVs with these Type codes.

   Type 1: L2TPv3 Tunnel information

   Type 2: mGRE Tunnel information

   Type 3: IPSec Tunnel information

   Type 4: MPLS Tunnel information

   Type 5: L2TPv3 in IPSEC Tunnel information

   Type 6: mGRE in IPSEC Tunnel information


3.1.1 L2TPv3 Tunnel information TLV

   The L2TPv3 Tunnel Information TLV has a type value of 1.  The value
   part of the L2TPv3 Tunnel Information Type contains the following :

               - Preference (2 Octets)
               - Flags (1 Octet)
               - Cookie Length (1 Octet)
               - Session ID (4 Octets)
               - Cookie     (Variable)

   The L2TPv3 Tunnel Information TLV looks as follows :



         0                   1
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

   where

   Length - A 2 Octet field that specifies the length of the L2TPv3
   attribute in octets.

   Preference - A 2 Octet field containing a Preference associated with
   the TLV. The Preference value indicates a preferred ordering of
   tunneling encapsulations according to the sender (i.e. egress PE).
   The recipient of the information SHOULD take the sender's preference
   into account in selecting which encapsulation it will use. A higher
   value indicates a higher preference.

   Flags - A 1 Octet field containing flag-bits. The leftmost bit
   indicates whether Sequence numbering is to be used or not. The
   remaining bits are reserved for future use.

   Cookie Length - is a 1 Octet field that contains the length of the
   Variable length Cookie.

   Session ID - A 4 Octet field containing a non-zero identifier for a
   session.  The Session ID is used to delineate services on the egress
   PE.  The support for a service such as MPLS VPN MUST have at least
   one Session ID assigned.  Multiple Session ID's may be assigned for
   the same service instance.  The primary motivation for assigning
   multiple Session ID's for the same service instance is provide a
   graceful transition when changing cookie values.  The egress PE can
   receive both Session ID's with their unqiue Cookie value thus
   allowing a graceful roll-over from an old Session ID and Cookie to a
   new Session ID and Cookie.  Alternatively, multiple service instances
   may be distributed across multiple processes in order to scale.  Each
   service instance may be assigned a unique Session ID and Cookie and
   advertised by BGP such that packets received from the ingress PE are
   directed to the appropriate service instance on the egress PE.

Internet Draft draft-nalawade-kapoor-tunnel-safi-05.txt                June 2006


   Cookie - Cookie is a variable length (maximum 64 bits), value used by
   L2TPv3 to check the association of a received data message with the
   session identified by the Session ID.  The Cookie value is tightly
   coupled with the Session ID.  Upon the generation of a Session ID by
   the egress PE, the associated Cookie MAY be generated such that
   packets received by the egress PE from an ingress PE can be quickly
   validated for proper service context.

   The default value of the Length Field for the L2TPv3 Tunnel
   information TLV is between 8 and 16 bytes, depending on the length of
   the Cookie field specified in Cookie length. If the length of the TLV
   is greater than that value, the subsequent portion of the Value field
   contains one or more sub-TLVs as defined in [BGP-TUN].

3.1.2 mGRE Tunnel Information TLV

   The mGRE Tunnel Information Type has a Type 2.  The value part of the
   mGRE Tunnel Information Type contains the following :

               - Preference (2 Octets)
               - Flags (1 Octet)
               - mGRE Key   (0 or 4 Octets)

   The mGRE Tunnel Information TLV looks as follows :



         0                   1
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

   the TLV. The Preference value indicates a preferred ordering of
   tunneling encapsulations according to the sender (i.e. egress PE).
   The recipient of the information (i.e. ingress PE) SHOULD take the
   sender's preference into account in selecting which encapsulation it
   will use. A higher value indicates a higher preference.

   Flags - A 1 Octet field containing flag-bits. The leftmost bit
   indicates whether Sequence numbering is to be used or not. The 2nd
   bit Indicates whether an mGRE Key is present or not. The Remaining
   bits are reserved for future use.

   Reserved - A 1 Octet field reserved for future use

   mGRE Key - A 4 Octet field containing an optional mGRE Key.  The key
   value may be generated by the egress PE and advertised by the egress
   PE to any potential ingress PE.  In this case, the key value has
   unidirectional relevance from all viable ingress PE's to the egress
   PE.  Alternatively, the key value may be statically configured such
   that all ingress and egress PE's use the same key value.

   If the Length field of the TLV contains a value greater than 3 Octets
   plus the value specified in the Key Length, the subsequent portion of
   the Value field contains one or more sub-TLVs as defined by [BGP-
   TUN].

3.1.3 IPSec Tunnel Information TLV

   Identifier used by the egress PE

   IKE_LNG - This 2 Octet field indicates the length of the IKE
   Identifier.

   IKE Identifier - A variable length field containing an IKE Identifier
   of the egress PE.

   If the Length field of the TLV contains a value greater than 11
   Octets plus the value specified in the Key Length, the subsequent
   portion of the Value field contains one or more sub-TLVs as defined
   by [BGP-TUN].

   defined in [BGP-MP], to advertise the corresponding (AFI, SAFI) pair.

5. Operation




draft-nalawade-kapoor-tunnel-safi-05.txt                                [Page 9]





Internet Draft draft-nalawade-kapoor-tunnel-safi-05.txt                June 2006


   A BGP Speaker that receives the Capability for the IPv4 Tunnel
   address family or the IPv6 Tunnel address family, MAY advertise the
   IPv4 Tunnel address family or IPv6 Tunnel address family prefixes to
   that peer.

   The BGP Tunnel Encapsulation attribute is defined only to be used in
   UPDATE messages for the IPv4 tunnel address family or the IPv6 Tunnel
   address family. If the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute is received
   in an UPDATE message for any other AFI/SAFI, it MUST be ignored.

   If a BGP Speaker receives an unrecognized Transitive Tunnel
   Encapsulation TLV as part of the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute,
   it MUST accept it and propagate it to other peers.

6. Deployment Considerations

   In order for the Tunnels to come up between two end-points, the BGP
   Speakers advertising the Tunnel end-points using the IPv4/IPv6 Tunnel
   SAFI, MUST exchange at least one common encapsulation option.

7. Applicability

7.1. IPSec Tunnels Applicability

   IPSec protection of IP routed packets requires the establishment of
   an IPSec proxy that specifies the source and destination range of
   addresses that require protection.  The synchronization of the IPSec
   proxy and the viability of the path to the destination IP address
   range has been a persistent problem in the deploy of IPSec solutions.
   The IPSec proxy must be associated with an IKE end-point identifier.
   IPSec is inherently a tunneling protocol; however, it has no means of
   synchronizing the viability of the destination path in the IPSec
   proxy.  One approach to synchronizing the IPSec proxy, the IKE end-
   point and the path viability is to leverage BGP Tunnel SAFI.  The BGP
   protocol provides a means of distributing the destination address
   range of the IPSec proxy via the NLRI.  The IKE end-point identifier
   may be consistent with the BGP next-hop and may be specified by the
   TLVs in the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute [BGP-TUN] in the BGP
   tunnel SAFI. An IPSec end-point that receives a BGP announcement may
   qualify the update and use the NLRI prefix as the destination range
   in the IPSec proxy.  The IPSec end-point may learn the remote peer's
   IKE identity that is defined by the next-hop attribute of the Tunnel
   SAFI. The route viability is Inherently conveyed via the BGP
   protocol.  The combination of the traditional IP NLRI and the Tunnel
   NLRI allows IPSec to automatically establish the connection
   attributes required to protect IP traffic between the two end-points.

7.2. IP Tunnels Applicability

   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) VPN introduced a peer-to-peer
   model that enables large scale IP VPN implementations. Traditional
   MPLS VPNs rely on an MPLS transport network to implement this peer-
   to-peer model.  the MPLS transport with an IP transport. VPN traffic
   is carried by an IP tunnel instead of an MPLS Label Switched Path
   (LSP). The VPN customer receives the same service experience
   regardless of the transport choice used by the service provider.

   MPLS VPN uses the same mechanisms for VPN route distribution
   regardless of the backbone transport choice (IP or MPLS). Customer
   edge (CE) devices exchange routing information with the provider edge
   (PE) devices using BGP or an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
   protocol. This routing information is exchanged between PEs using
   Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP). VPN routing information is carried by
   MP-BGP as VPNv4 addresses. As part of this VPN route exchange, PEs
   learn the nexthop (egress PE) and a VPN label to be associated with
   each VPN route.

   Before proper VPNv4 BGP next hop resolution can take place, each PE
   needs to know which other PEs (i.e. Tunnel endpoints) are reachable
   via the IP tunnel.

   The Tunnel SAFI update messages provide a means of distributing the
   Tunnel endpoint address as the NLRI in the Tunnel SAFI UPDATE. The
   Tunnel endpoint address should be consistent with the BGP next-hop in
   the VPNv4 update messages. This information is used to determine
   which IP tunnel needs to be used for which VPNv4 prefixes.

   In addition, each PE needs to know the tunnel attributes (used to
   define this tunnel) that other PEs expect, so VPN packets can be
   encapsulated appropriately. Manual configuration of this information
   is not scalable, as the number of PEs increases. A PE that receives
   the Tunnel SAFI update may use the tunnel NLRI prefix and the tunnel
   attributes specified by the other end, and try and establish a tunnel
   to that endpoint. PEs take advantage of the existing MP-BGP
   infrastructure to distribute tunnel endpoint information. The Tunnel
   SAFI UPDATE message is used to signal tunnel attribute and endpoint
   information amongst PEs. And thus tunnel endpoint discovery is
   accomplished using MP-BGP updates.

8. Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues.
