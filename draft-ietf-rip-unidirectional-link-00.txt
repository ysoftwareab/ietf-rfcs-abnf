Abstract

   This document defines the modifications which can be applied to RIP
   [rfc1723] which make the communication over asymmetric links
   feasible.


1. Introduction

   RIP is one of the first dynamic routing protocols used in the
   internet known as Internal Gateway Protocol. It was designed to work
   on networks where adjacent gateways communicate using the same link
   in both directions. Links may be asymmetric, e.g., have different
   delays and throughputs in different directions, but they have to be
   duplex.


2. Overcoming RIP restrictions

Internet Draft        Unidirectional links and RIP         15 March 1996


   A satellite network comprises two sets of stations, feeds that can
   both send and receive packets, and receivers that can only receive
   packets.

   Feeds must be allowed to forward over the satellite links the packets
   which are bound to subnets accessible through other feeds or through
   receivers.

   Receivers will never send any packet via the satellite link. They
   must however send reports to the feeds to indicate the subnets for
   which they are ready to receive packets.

   If the network included only feeds, RIP could be used almost
   unchanged. Usage by a mix of receivers and feeds requires some
   extensions.


3. Proposed solution

   In our example we assume that G1 and G2 (Gateways) are connected to
   symmetric and asymmetric networks (See Figure 1). Using RIP, G1 does
   not consider G2 as a neighbor because the link is unidirectional and
   therefore will send packets to the regular connections (route N3).


                               route N1
            N2      ----                      ----      N5
        ---========>|G1| ===================> |G2|<==========---
                    ----      update msg      ----
                     /\                        /\
                     ||   ------------------   ||
                      ====|  regular       |====
                       N3 |    connections | N4
                          ------------------
                               Figure 1


   To avoid such behavior, G1 should consider G2 as a neighbor. RIP
   should be modified to take into account unidirectional links.

   RIP messages are composed of a succession of 20 bytes segments. The
   first segment may be an authentication code. All other segments are
   subnet-distance pairs. We propose to associate a specific
   authentication with the satellite network. The handling of this code
   will be different by feeds and receivers.


3.1. Handling by receivers

   Upon reception of a RIP packet, receivers examine the authentication
   code. They note that this packet was sent by a satellite feed. They
   will ignore all subnet-distance announces contained in this packet,
   but they will add the source address of the packet [IP source] to the
   list of "potential feeds".

   At pseudo-regular intervals, the receivers will send to the potential
   feeds a RIP packet that will be authenticated as a "satellite
   packet". This packet, however, will not be sent to the regular
   multicast address of all the RIP routers. Instead, a copy of this
   packet will be sent to the unicast address of each feed.

   This procedure assumes that there is another route, beside the
   satellite link, by which the receiver can send packets to the feed.


3.2 processing by feeds

   Processing of RIP packets by feeds is almost unchanged, except the
   following :

   - all packets sent over the multicast link are authenticated.
   - all packets that are authenticated as satellite packets are
   processed even if they routed by another interface.
