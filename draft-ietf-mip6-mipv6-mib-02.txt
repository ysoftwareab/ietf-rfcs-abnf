1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


2.  Overview

2.1 The Mobile IPv6 Protocol entities.

   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [MIPv6] specifies a protocol which allows nodes
   to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet. An
   entity which implements the MIPv6 protocol is an MIPv6 entity. There
   are three types of entities envisaged by the MIPv6 protocol.

      mobile node (MN): A node that can change its point of attachment
      from one link to another, while still being reachable via its home
      address.

      correspondent node (CN): A peer node with which a mobile node is
      communicating. The correspondent node may be either mobile or
      stationary. [Note that a corespondent node does not necessarily
      require MIPv6 support.]

      home agent (HA): A router on a mobile node's home link with which
      the mobile node has registered its current care-of address. While
      the mobile node is away from home, the home agent intercepts
      packets on the home link destined to the mobile node's home address,
      encapsulates them, and routes them to the mobile node's registered
      care-of address.

   This document defines the managed objects that will be required to
   monitor and control MIPv6 entities.

2.2 Terminology.
   The terminolgy used in this document is consistent with the
   definitions used in Mobile IPv6 protocol specification[MIPv6].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].



3.  Mobile IPv6 Monitoring and Control Requirements

   For managing a MIPv6 entity it is necessary to monitor
   the following
       o capabilities of MIPv6 entities
       o traffic due to MIPv6
       o binding related statistics (at HA, CN, MN )
       o binding details (at HA, CN)
       o history of Binding Updates (at HA, CN, MN)

   The MIPv6 protocol document stipulates that several MIPv6 related
   parameters should be manually configurable. The MIPv6 MIB should
   define managed objects that can be used to configure the related
   parameters e.g.
       o the preference value the home agent will use in Router
   Advertisements,
       o the lifetime value the home agent will use in Router
   Advertisements,
       o whether a home agent will send ICMP Mobile Prefix
   Advertisements to
         mobile nodes,
       o whether a home agent will respond to ICMP Mobile Prefix
   Solicitation
         messages from mobile nodes and,
       o whether a home agent will process multicast group membership
   control
         messages from mobile nodes.

4.  MIB Design.

   The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as  possible
   and at the same time to make it effective enough so that the
   essential needs of monitoring and control are met. It is envisaged
   that wherever possible existing MIBS will be used (e.g. IPSec MIB,
   Neighbour Discovery MIB, Tunnel MIB.) for monitor and control of
   MIPv6 entities.

   The Mobile-IPv6 MIB comprises of following sets of groups
       - mipv6IP: a generic group containing objects that are common
         to all the Mobile IPv6  entities.
       - mipv6Ha: this group models the home agent service. It
         comprises of objects specific to the services and associated
         advertisement parameters offerred by the home agent on each
         of its links. It also contains objects pertaining to the
         maintenance of the home agent list on each of the links on
         which the service is offered.
       - mipv6Mn: this group models the mobile node service. It
         comprises of objects specific to the Dynamic Home Agent
         discovery function and related parameters. It also contains
         objects that record the movement of the mobile node.
       - mipv6Cn: models the correspondent node and is primarily
         scoped to its participation in the Return Routability
         procedure for achieving Route Optimization triggered by
         the mobile node.
       - mipv6Notifications: defines the set of notifications that
         will be used to asynchronously monitor the Mobile IPv6
         entities.

   The tables contained in the above groups are as follows-
       mipv6BindingCacheTable   : models the binding cache on the home agent
                                  and correspondent node. It contains details
                                  of the Binding Update requests that have been
                                  received and accepted.
       mipv6BindingHistoryTable : tracks the history of the binding cache.
       mipv6NodeTrafficTable    : the mobile node-wise traffic counters.
       mipv6MnHomeAddressTable  : contains all the home addresses
                                  pertaining to the mobile node and
                                  the corresponding registration status.
       mipv6MnBLTable           : models the Binding Update List on the
                                  mobile node. It contains information
                                  about the registration requests sent
                                  by the mobile node and the corresponding
                                  results.
       mipv6CnCounterTable      : contains the mobile node-wise
                                  registration statistics.
       mipv6HaConfTable         : contains the configurable

                                  the home agent service is
                                  advertised.
       mipv6HaCounterTable      : contains registration statistics
                                  for all mobile nodes registered
                                  with the home agent.
       mipv6HaListTable         : contains the list of all routers
                                  that are acting as home agents on
                                  each of the interfaces on which
                                  the home agent service is offered
                                  by this router.
       mipv6HaGlobalAddrTable   : contains the global addresses of
                                  the jome agents.

Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
        mipv6Status: This value of this object is used to enable or
                     disable the MIPv6 functionality on a MIPv6 entity.
                     Access to this MO may be abused to disrupt the
                     MIPv6 communication.
        mipv6HaAdvPreference: Access to this object may be abused to
   force
                     MNs into selecting the wrong HA.
        mipv6HaAdvLifetime: Access to this object may be abused to set
   the
                     advertised lifetime to incorrect values. That will
                     have an adverse impact on the MIPv6 communication.
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

    The address related objects in this MIB may be considered to be
    particularly sensitive and/or private.  The care of address related
    objects reveal the location and movement of the mobile node. This
    information may be considered to be private and sensitive and must
    be carefully handled.
        mipv6BindingHstCOAType
        mipv6BindingHstCOA
        mipv6MnBLCOAType
        mipv6MnBLCOA

    The mobile node's home address and home agent related information
    may be considered to be sensitive too as these may provide clues to
    a malicious party on ways to disrupt the mobile nodes communication
    channels.
        mipv6BindingHstHomeAddressType,
        mipv6BindingHstHomeAddress,
        mipv6MnHomeAddressType,
        mipv6MnHomeAddress

    The correspondent node's addresses related MOs will reveal the nodes

    with whom the mobile node is corresponding. This information may be
    considered private and sensitive.
        mipv6MnBLNodeAddressType,
        mipv6MnBLNodeAddress


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
