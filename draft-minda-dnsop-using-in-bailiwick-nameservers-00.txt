Abstract

   Many People know that reverse DNS lookup of IN-ADDR.ARAP zone is
   slow.  People supposed to be the case is issue of LAME delegation.
   But this is not correct.  There are two reasons.  One is glulessness
   and the other is BIND 8 on caching nameserver.  Most of nameservers
   in ARPA zone are out-of-bailiwick names and this causes gluelessness

   This document explains the problem with gluelessness, the problem
   with old BIND implementations and suggests recommended way to
   configure nameservers in .ARPA.
