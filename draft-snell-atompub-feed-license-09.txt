1.  Introduction

   This document defines an extension to the Atom Syndication Format
   that can be used to describe the explicit rights that have been
   granted to consumers of an Atom feed or entry.

1.1.  Experimental Status

   Describing licenses using the mechanisms defined in this
   specification is currently considered to be largely experimental.
   While it is a common practice for feed publishers to associate
   licenses with syndicated content, there are still very few feed
   consumers that utilize such metadata and the effectiveness of doing
   so is still largely unknown.  As it is not yet certain how these
   mechanisms will be used, implementations and feedback are encouraged.

1.2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology

   The term "link relation" refers to the value of the Atom link
   elements "rel" attribute as defined in section 4.2.7.2 of [RFC4287].

   The term "license" refers to a potentially machine-readable
   description of explicit rights, and associated obligations, that have
   been granted to consumers of an Atom feed or entry.


2.  The "license" link relation

   The "license" link relation can be used to associate licenses with a
   feed or entry.

   Feed and entry elements MAY contain any number of "license" link
   relations but MUST NOT contain more than one with the same
   combination of href and type attribute values.  The IRI specified by
   the link's 'href' attribute SHOULD be dereferenceable to return a
   representation of the license.  The license representation MAY be
   machine readable.

   Feeds and entries can be dual-licensed by including multiple
   "license" link relations specifying different href attribute values.
   If multiple license link relations are specified, each SHOULD contain
   a title attribute specifying a human-readable label for the license.

   If an entry element does not contain a "license" link relation, then
   the "license" link relation of the containing feed or contained
   source element, if present, is considered to apply to the entry.

2.1.  Unspecified License Links

   A publisher can use an "unspecified license link" (a "license" link
   relation with an href attribute value equal to
   "http://purl.org/atompub/license#unspecified") to indicate that a
   feed or license has not been explicitly linked to a license
   description.

   A feed or entry containing an unspecified license link MUST NOT
   contain any other license link relations.

2.2.  Example

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
       <id>http://www.example.com/myfeed</id>
       <title>My Example Feed</title>
       <updated>2005-07-28T12:00:00Z</updated>
       <link href="http://www.example.com/myfeed" />
       <link rel="license" type="application/rdf+xml"
         href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/rdf" />
       <rights>
         Copyright (c) 2005. Some rights reserved. This feed
         is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribute-NonCommercial
         Use License. It contains material originally published by
         Jane Smith at http://www.example.com/entries/1 under the
         Creative Commons Attribute License.

           href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/" />
       </entry>
     </feed>

2.3.  Relationship with the "atom:rights" element

   License link relations are related to the "atom:rights" element in
   that both are intended to communicate information about the rights



Snell                     Expires April 9, 2007                 [Page 4]

   associated with an Atom document.  Where the two differ, however, is
   in the fact that "atom:rights" is intended strictly as a human-
   readable assertion of rights held over a work while the license link
   relation is intended to provide a potentially machine-readable
   description of what rights have been granted to others.  The two
   constructs may overlap one another and conflicts could arise if they
   are contradictory.  It is important that publishers of Atom documents
   ensure that the "atom:rights" and license link relations are
   consistent with one another.


3.  Security Considerations

   When "license" link relations are used in Atom documents, the
   security considerations specified in [RFC4287] Section 8 apply.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one new Atom link relation type to be
   registered in the IANA Registry of Link Relations as defined by
   [RFC4287].
       Attribute Value: license
       Description: Specifies the IRI of a license associated with
                    the containing feed, entry or source element.
                    Expected display characteristics: None
       Security considerations: When "license" link relations are used
                    in Atom documents, the security considerations for
                    handling links in Atom documents apply.
