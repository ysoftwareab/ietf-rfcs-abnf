1. Abstract 
    
   E.164 numbers are often used for fax addresses. Internet fax 
   provides store-and-forward (T.37) and real-time (T.38) modes. 
   Subscribers could use ENUM to store Internet fax preferences in DNS 
   under their fax numbers. Network devices could then query DNS to 
   retrieve that information. An example is subscriber preferences for 
   receiving faxes via Internet mail or SIP delivery. Further work on 
   ENUM for Internet Fax is indicated, one example being H.323 
   delivery. Policy aspects are out of scope of this draft. This 
   document is not associated with any working group. Comments may be 
   sent to the author. 
    
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   This document includes very preliminary work. References to relevant 
   Internet RFCs and ITU-T Recommendations are provided. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in

3. ENUM and DNS 
    
   ENUM is described in RFC 2916 [3].  The response to a DNS query of 
   an E.164 number may contain multiple NAPTR records [4]. Each record 
   contains a URI, from which a service and address may be derived. An 
   example from RFC 2916 is the following: 
    
   - The original E.164 number is:                      +46-8-976-1234. 
   - The queried ENUM name is:           4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4.e164.arpa. 
   - The DNS response is: 
    
   $ORIGIN 4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4.e164.arpa. 
      IN NAPTR 100 10 "u" "sip+E2U"    "!^.*$!sip:info@tele2.se!"     . 
      IN NAPTR 102 10 "u" "mailto+E2U" "!^.*$!mailto:info@tele2.se!"  . 
    
   This indicates that the subscriber prefers to be contacted first via 
   SIP and second via SMTP. 
    
    
4. Internet Fax Operational Modes 
    
   General concepts for Internet fax may be found in RFC 2542 [5] and 
   Rec. F.185 [6]. References for store-and-forward Internet fax 
   include RFC 2305 [7], RFC 2532 [8] and Rec. T.37 [9]. A reference 
   for real-time Internet fax is Rec. T.38 [10]. Fax operational modes 
   are roughly as follows: 
    
   - Store-and-forward fax using Internet mail (Rec. T.37): 
     - simple mode - supports transfer of image data. 
     - extended (full) mode - adds capabilities exchange, confirmation. 
    
   - Real-time (session oriented) fax over IP networks (Rec. T.38): 
     - preserves contents and sequence of messages, and 
     - maintains direct communications comparable to circuit-switched. 
    
   See the references for further information. 
    
    
5. Possible URIs and NAPTRs for T.37 and T.38 faxes 
    
   URIs are described in RFC 2396 [11]. Email addressing for Internet 
   Fax is described in RFC 2304 [12] and RFC 2846 [13]. For SIP start 
   with RFC 2543 [14]. For telephony URLs see RFC 2806 [15]. 
    
   URIs may be used for service-specific handling. For T.37 and T.38 
   faxes, possible URIs based on example addresses might include: 
    
   - mailto:FAX=+46-8-976-1234@faxworld.org 
   - sip:+46-8-976-1234@sipsco.com 
    
   Further work is indicated and could include H.323.

                    ENUM, E.164, and Internet Fax       November 2000 
 
 
    
   NAPTRs (Naming Authority Pointer DNS resource records) are described 
   in RFC 2915. ENUM use of NAPTRs is decribed in RFC 2916. The usage 
   is roughly described as, "E.164 in, URIs out." The NAPTR fields for 
   this include the service and regexp fields. The service field may 
   contain values for a protocol specification and a resolution 
   service. The regexp field (regular expression) shows how to 
   construct a name to use for the next step. 
    
   NAPTRs may be used for service-specific handling. For T.37 and T.38 
   faxes, possible values for the service field could include 
   T37fax+E2U and T38fax+E2U. This would indicate a particular fax 
   protocol and its association with a resolution service. 
    
   It is possible to imagine NAPTR records for store-and-forward and 
   real-time Internet fax that could look like the following: 
    
   IN NAPTR 100 10 "u" (          ; continue across line break 
                   "T38fax+E2U"   ; service field 
      "!^.*$!sip:+46-8-976-1234@sipsco.com!" ; regexp 
                   .   )          ; end of record 
    
   IN NAPTR 102 10 "u" (          ; continue across line break 
                   "T37fax+E2U"   ; service field 
      "!^.*$!mailto:fax=+46-8-976-1234@faxworld.org!" ; regexp 
                   .   )          ; end of record 
    
   In this example, real-time fax is preferred over store-and-forward 
   fax. Note that the T.38 record is given first by convention based on 
   the values in the order and preference fields. 
    
   Further work is indicated and could include H.323. 
 
    
6. ENUM and Internet Fax 
    
   A network device, such as an Internet fax gateway (onramp or 
   offramp) or an Internet Aware Fax (IAF) device, could use ENUM when 
   handling a fax addressed to an E.164 number. 
    
   In the example above, a DNS query returns information that the 
   subscriber prefers real-time delivery via SIP for Internet faxes, 
   but store-and-forward delivery by SMTP is also available. 
    
   Further work is indicated and could include H.323. 
    
   ENUM could allow a subscriber to consolidate a variety of delivery 
   options. ENUM might also support Internet fax in a variety of ways.  
    
   Using NAPTRs provides flexibility for ENUM for Internet fax.  The 
   example applies to delivery preference, service choice, and address 
   resolution, through the appropriate use of the order, service, 
   regexp, and other fields. Further work is indicated.

7. Formal Syntax 
    
   A possible goal of looking at ENUM for Internet fax is the 
   specification of NAPTRs and protocols for T.37 and T.38 faxes, for 
   delivery via Internet mail and SIP (and possibly H.323).  
    
   Formal syntax may be developed as these and other possibilities are 
   identified and considered. Further work is indicated. 
    
    
8. Security Considerations 
 
   Various RFCs and Internet drafts have already identified security 
   considerations for modes of Internet fax, Internet mail, SIP, and 
   ENUM. Further work is indicated to determine if different or 
   otherwise unforeseen security matters might occur.
