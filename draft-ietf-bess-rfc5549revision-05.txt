  Advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information with an IPv6
                                Next Hop
                   draft-ietf-bess-rfc5549revision-05

Abstract

   Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of usable next-hop
   address families is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI)
   and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).  The AFI/SAFI
   definitions for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for
   advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when
   advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or
   VPN-IPv4 NLRI.

   This document specifies the extensions necessary to allow advertising
   IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address that belongs to
   the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI
   definitions to allow the address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or
   VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of
   the Next Hop to determine which of the protocols the address actually
   belongs to, and a BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically
   discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with
   an IPv6 Next Hop. This document obsoletes RFC5549.

1.  Introduction

   Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) [RFC4760] specifies that the set of
   network-layer protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop
   field may belong is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI)
   and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).  A number of
   existing AFI/SAFIs allow the Next Hop address to belong to a
   different address family than the Network Layer Reachability
   Information (NLRI).  For example, the AFI/SAFI <25/65> used (as per
   [RFC6074]) to perform L2VPN auto-discovery, allows advertising NLRI
   that contains the identifier of a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)



Litkowski, et al.         Expires March 4, 2021                 [Page 2]

   instance or that identifies a particular pool of attachment circuits
   at a given Provider Edge (PE), while the Next Hop field contains the
   loopback address of a PE.  Similarly, the AFI/SAFI <1/132> (defined
   in [RFC4684]) to advertise Route Target (RT) membership information,
   allows advertising NLRI that contains such RT membership information,
   while the Next Hop field contains the address of the advertising
   router.

   Furthermore, a number of these existing AFI/SAFIs allow the Next Hop
   to belong to either the IPv4 protocol or the IPv6 protocol, and
   specify the encoding of the Next Hop information to determine which
   of the protocols the address actually belongs to.  For example,
   [RFC4684] allows the Next Hop address to be either an IPv4 or IPv6
   address and states that the Next Hop field address shall be
   interpreted as an IPv4 address whenever the length of Next Hop
   address is 4 octets, and as an IPv6 address whenever the length of
   the Next Hop address is 16 octets.

   There are situations such as those described in [RFC4925] and in
   [RFC5565] where carriers (or large enterprise networks acting as
   carrier for their internal resources) may be required to establish
   connectivity between 'islands' of networks of one address family type
   across a transit core of a differing address family type.  This
   includes both the case of IPv6 islands across an IPv4 core and the
   case of IPv4 islands across an IPv6 core.  Where Multiprotocol BGP
   (MP-BGP) is used to advertise the corresponding reachability
   information, this translates into the requirement for a BGP speaker
   to advertise Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) of a given
   address family via a Next Hop of a different address family (i.e.,
   IPv6 NLRI with IPv4 Next Hop and IPv4 NLRI with IPv6 Next Hop).

   The AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv6 address family assume that the
   Next Hop address belongs to the IPv6 address family type.
   Specifically, as per [RFC2545] and [RFC8277], when the <AFI/SAFI> is
   <2/1>, <2/2>, or <2/4>, the Next Hop address is assumed to be of IPv6
   type.  As per [RFC4659], when the <AFI/SAFI> is <2/128>, the Next Hop
   address is assumed to be of VPN-IPv6 type.

   However, [RFC4798] and [RFC4659] specify how an IPv4 address can be
   encoded inside the Next Hop IPv6 address field when IPv6 NLRI needs
   to be advertised with an IPv4 Next Hop.  [RFC4798] defines how the
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 address format specified in the IPv6 addressing
   architecture ([RFC4291]) can be used for that purpose when the <AFI/
   SAFI> is <2/1>, <2/2>, or <2/4>.  [RFC4659] defines how the IPv4-
   mapped IPv6 address format as well as a null Route Distinguisher can
   be used for that purpose when the <AFI/SAFI> is <2/128>.  Thus, there
   are existing solutions for the advertisement of IPv6 NLRI with an
   IPv4 Next Hop.

Internet-Draft               rfc5549revision                 August 2020


   Similarly, the AFI/SAFI definitions for advertisement of IPv4 NLRI or
   VPN-IPv4 NLRI assume that the Next Hop address belongs to the IPv4
   address family type.  Specifically, as per [RFC4760] and [RFC8277],
   when the <AFI/SAFI> is <1/1>, <1/2>, or <1/4>, the Next Hop address
   is assumed to be of IPv4 type.  As per [RFC4364], when the <AFI/SAFI>
   is <1/128>, the Next Hop address is assumed to be of VPN-IPv4 type.
   As per [RFC6513] and [RFC6514], when the <AFI/SAFI> is <1/129>, the
   Next Hop address is assumed to be of VPN-IPv4 type.  There is clearly
   no generally applicable method for encoding an IPv6 address inside
   the IPv4 address field of the Next Hop.  Hence, there is currently no
   specified solution for advertising IPv4 or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6
   Next Hop.

   This document specifies the extensions necessary to allow advertising
   IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address that belongs to
   the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI
   definitions to allow the address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or
   VPN-IPv4 NLRI to belong to either the IPv4 or the IPv6 protocol, the
   encoding of the Next Hop information to determine which of the
   protocols the address actually belongs to, and a BGP Capability
   allowing MP-BGP peers to dynamically discover whether they can
   exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN- IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop.  The BGP
   Capability allows gradual deployment of the functionality of
   advertising IPv4 reachability via an IPv6 Next Hop, without any flag
   day nor any risk of traffic black-holing.

   This document obsoletes [RFC5549].

2.  Changes compared to RFC5549

   This document introduces two significant changes compared to
   [RFC5549]:

      In [RFC5549], when AFI/SAFI 1/128 is used, the nexthop address is
      encoded as an IPv6 address with a length of 16 or 32 bytes.  To
      accomodate all existing implementations and bring consistency with
      VPNv4oIPv4 and VPNv6oIPv6, this document modifies how the nexthop
      address is encoded.  The nexthop address is now encoded as an VPN-
      IPv6 address with a length of 24 or 48 bytes.  (See Section 4 and
      Section 7.2).  This change addresses the errata 5253.  As all
      known and deployed implementations are interoperable today and are
      using the new proposed encoding, the change does not break
      existing interoperability.

      This document allows AFI/SAFI 1/129 (IPv4 multicast) to use an
      IPv6 underlay using a similar encoding and procedures as for AFI/
      SAFI 1/128.  (See Section 4 and Section 7.3)

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Extension of AFI/SAFI Definitions for the IPv4 Address Family

   As mentioned earlier, MP-BGP specifies that the set of usable next-
   hop address families is determined by the Address Family Identifier
   (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).  The
   following AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI
   (<1/1>, <1/2>, <1/4>, <1/128> and <1/129>) only have provisions for
   advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol.
   This document extends the definition of the AFI/SAFI for
   advertisement of IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI to extend the set of
   usable next-hop address families to include IPv6 in addition to IPv4.

   Specifically, this document allows advertising the MP_REACH_NLRI
   attribute [RFC4760] with this content:

   o  AFI = 1

   o  SAFI = 1, 2, or 4

   o  Length of Next Hop Address = 16 or 32

   o  Next Hop Address = IPv6 address of next hop (potentially followed
      by the link-local IPv6 address of the next hop).  This field is to
      be constructed as per Section 3 of [RFC2545].

   o  NLRI= NLRI as per AFI/SAFI definition

   It also allows advertising the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute [RFC4760] with
   this content:

   o  AFI = 1

   o  SAFI = 128 or 129

   o  Length of Next Hop Address = 24 or 48

   o  Next Hop Address = VPN-IPv6 address of next hop with an 8-octet RD
      set to zero (potentially followed by the link-local VPN-IPv6
      address of the next hop with an 8-octet RD set to zero).

   o  NLRI= NLRI as per AFI/SAFI definition

   This is in addition to the existing mode of operation allowing
   advertisement of NLRI for <AFI/SAFI> of <1/1>, <1/2> and <1/4> with a
   next hop address of IPv4 type and advertisement of NLRI for <AFI/
   SAFI> of <1/128> and <1/129> with a next hop address of VPN-IPv4
   type.

   The BGP speaker receiving the advertisement MUST use the Length of
   Next Hop Address field to determine which network-layer protocol the
   next hop address belongs to.

   o  When the AFI/SAFI is <1/1>, <1/2> or <1/4> and when the Length of
      Next Hop Address field is equal to 16 or 32, the next hop address
      is of type IPv6.

   o  When the AFI/SAFI is <1/128>, or <1/129> and when the Length of
      Next Hop Address field is equal to 24 or 48, the next hop address
      is of type VPN-IPv6.

   Note that this method of using the Length of the Next Hop Address
   field to determine which network-layer protocol the next hop address
   belongs to (out of the set of protocols allowed by the AFI/SAFI
   definition) is the same as used in [RFC4684] and [RFC6074].

5.  Use of BGP Capability Advertisement

   [RFC5492] defines a mechanism to allow two BGP speakers to discover
   if a particular capability is supported by their BGP peer and thus
   whether it can be used with that peer.  This document defines a
   capability that can be advertised using [RFC5492] and that is
   referred to as the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability.  This
   capability allows BGP speakers to discover whether, for a given NLRI
   <AFI/SAFI>, a peer supports advertisement with a next hop whose
   network protocol is determined by the value of the Length of Next Hop
   Address field, as specified in Section 4.

   A BGP speaker that wishes to advertise to a BGP peer an IPv6 Next Hop
   for IPv4 NLRI or for VPN-IPv4 NLRI as per this specification MUST use
   the Capability Advertisement procedures defined in [RFC5492] with the
   Extended Next Hop Encoding Capability to determine whether its peer
   supports this for the NLRI AFI/SAFI pair(s) of interest.  The fields
   in the Capabilities Optional Parameter MUST be set as follows:

   o  The Capability Code field MUST be set to 5 (which indicates the
      Extended Next Hop Encoding capability).

Internet-Draft               rfc5549revision                 August 2020


   o  The Capability Length field is set to a variable value that is the
      length of the Capability Value field (which follows).

   o  The Capability Value field has the following format:


            +-----------------------------------------------------+
            | NLRI AFI - 1 (2 octets)                             |
            +-----------------------------------------------------+
            | NLRI SAFI - 1 (2 octets)                            |
            +-----------------------------------------------------+
            | Nexthop AFI - 1 (2 octets)                          |
            +-----------------------------------------------------+
            | .....                                               |
            +-----------------------------------------------------+
            | NLRI AFI - N (2 octets)                             |
            +-----------------------------------------------------+
            | NLRI SAFI - N (2 octets)                            |
            +-----------------------------------------------------+
            | Nexthop AFI - N (2 octets)                          |
            +-----------------------------------------------------+


      where:

      *  each triple <NLRI AFI, NLRI SAFI, Nexthop AFI> indicates that
         NLRI of <NLRI AFI / NLRI SAFI> may be advertised with a Next
         Hop address belonging to the network-layer protocol of Nexthop
         AFI.

      *  the AFI and SAFI values are defined in the Address Family
         Identifier and Subsequent Address Family Identifier registries
         maintained by IANA.

   Since this document only concerns itself with the advertisement of
   IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop, this specification
   only allows the following values in the Capability Value field of the
   Extended Next Hop Encoding capability:

   o  NLRI AFI = 1 (IPv4)

   o  NLRI SAFI = 1, 2, 4, 128 or 129

   o  Nexthop AFI = 2 (IPv6)

   This document does not specify the use of the Extended Next Hop
   Encoding capability with any other combinations of <NLRI AFI, NLRI
   SAFI, Nexthop AFI>.  For example, the Next Hop Encoding capability

Internet-Draft               rfc5549revision                 August 2020


   specified in this document is not intended to be used for NLRI AFI/
   SAFIs whose definition already allows use of both IPv4 and IPv6 next
   hops (e.g., AFI/SAFI = <1/132> as defined in [RFC4684]).  Similarly,
   it is not intended that the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability be
   used for NLRI AFI/SAFIs for which there is already a solution for
   advertising a next hop of a different address family (e.g., AFI/SAFI
   = <2/1>, <2/2>, or <2/4> with IPv4 Next Hop as per [RFC4798] and AFI/
   SAFI = <2/128> with IPv4 Next Hop as per [RFC4659]).

   It is expected that if new AFI/SAFIs are defined in the future, their
   definition will have provisions (where appropriate) for both IPv4 and
   IPv6 Next Hops from the beginning, with determination based on Length
   of Next Hop Address field.  Thus, new AFI/SAFIs are not expected to
   make use of the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability.

   A BGP speaker MUST only advertise to a BGP peer the IPv4 or VPN-IPv4
   NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop if the BGP speaker has first ascertained
   via BGP Capability Advertisement that the BGP peer supports the
   Extended Next Hop Encoding capability for the relevant AFI/SAFI pair.

   The Extended Next Hop Encoding capability provides information about
   next hop encoding for a given AFI/SAFI, assuming that AFI/SAFI is
   allowed.  It does not influence whether that AFI/SAFI is indeed
   allowed.  Whether a AFI/SAFI can be used between the BGP peers is
   purely determined through the Multiprotocol Extensions capability
   defined in [RFC4760].

6.  Operations

   By default, if a particular BGP session is running over IPvx (where
   IPvx is IPv4 or IPv6), and if the BGP speaker sending an update is
   putting its own address in as the next hop, then the next hop address
   SHOULD be specified as an IPvx address, using the encoding rules
   specified in the AFI/SAFI definition of the NLRI being updated.  This
   default behavior may be overridden by policy.

   When a next hop address needs to be passed along unchanged (e.g., as
   a Route Reflector (RR) would do), its encoding MUST NOT be changed.
   If a particular RR client cannot handle that encoding (as determined
   by the BGP Capability Advertisement), then the NLRI in question
   cannot be distributed to that client.  For sound routing in certain
   scenarios, this will require that all the RR clients be able to
   handle whatever encodings any of them may generate.

7.  Usage Examples

7.1.  IPv4 over IPv6 Core

   The extensions defined in this document may be used as discussed in
   [RFC5565] for the interconnection of IPv4 islands over an IPv6
   backbone.  In this application, Address Family Border Routers (AFBRs;
   as defined in [RFC4925]) advertise IPv4 NLRI in the MP_REACH_NLRI
   along with an IPv6 Next Hop.

   The MP_REACH_NLRI is encoded with:

   o  AFI = 1

   o  SAFI = 1

   o  Length of Next Hop Network Address = 16 (or 32)

   o  Network Address of Next Hop = IPv6 address of Next Hop

   o  NLRI = IPv4 routes

   During BGP Capability Advertisement, the PE routers would include the
   following fields in the Capabilities Optional Parameter:

   o  Capability Code set to "Extended Next Hop Encoding"

   o  Capability Value containing <NLRI AFI=1, NLRI SAFI=1, Nexthop
      AFI=2>

7.2.  IPv4 VPN unicast over IPv6 Core

   The extensions defined in this document may be used for support of
   IPv4 VPNs over an IPv6 backbone.  In this application, PE routers
   would advertise VPN-IPv4 NLRI in the MP_REACH_NLRI along with an IPv6
   Next Hop.

   The MP_REACH_NLRI is encoded with:

   o  AFI = 1

   o  SAFI = 128

   o  Length of Next Hop Network Address = 24 (or 48)

   o  Network Address of Next Hop = VPN-IPv6 address of Next Hop whose
      RD is set to zero

   o  NLRI = IPv4-VPN routes

   During BGP Capability Advertisement, the PE routers would include the
   following fields in the Capabilities Optional Parameter:

   o  Capability Code set to "Extended Next Hop Encoding"

   o  Capability Value containing <NLRI AFI=1, NLRI SAFI=128, Nexthop
      AFI=2>

7.3.  IPv4 VPN multicast over IPv6 Core

   The extensions defined in this document may be used for support of
   IPv4 multicast VPNs over an IPv6 backbone.  In this application, PE
   routers would advertise VPN-IPv4 NLRI in the MP_REACH_NLRI along with
   an IPv6 Next Hop.

   The MP_REACH_NLRI is encoded with:

   o  AFI = 1

   o  SAFI = 129

   o  Length of Next Hop Network Address = 24 (or 48)

   o  Network Address of Next Hop = VPN-IPv6 address of Next Hop whose
      RD is set to zero

   o  NLRI = IPv4-VPN routes

   During BGP Capability Advertisement, the PE routers would include the
   following fields in the Capabilities Optional Parameter:

   o  Capability Code set to "Extended Next Hop Encoding"

   o  Capability Value containing <NLRI AFI=1, NLRI SAFI=129, Nexthop
      AFI=2>

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not define any new code point compared to
   [RFC5549].  IANA is requested to update the reference for the
   existing registration mentioned below.

   This document defines, in Section 5, a new Capability Code to
   indicate the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability in the [RFC5492]
   Capabilities Optional Parameter.  The value for this new Capability

   Code is 5, which is in the range set aside for allocation using the
   "IETF Review" policy defined in [RFC8126].

9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise any additional security issues beyond
   those of BGP-4 and the Multiprotocol extensions for BGP-4.  The same
   security mechanisms are applicable.

   However, as [RFC4272] discusses, BGP is vulnerable to traffic
   diversion attacks.  The ability to advertise an IPv6 Next Hop adds a
   new means by which an attacker could cause traffic to be diverted
   from its normal path.  Such an attack differs from pre-existing
   vulnerabilities in that traffic could be forwarded to a distant
   target across an intervening network infrastructure (e.g. an IPv6
   core), allowing an attack to potentially succeed more easily, since
   less infrastructure would have to be subverted.  Potential
   consequences include "hijacking" of traffic or denial of service.

   Although not expected to be the typical case, the IPv6 address used
   as the BGP Next Hop Address could be an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address (as
   defined in [RFC4291]).  Configuration of the security mechanisms
   potentially deployed by the network operator (such as security checks
   on next hop address) need to keep this case in mind also.
