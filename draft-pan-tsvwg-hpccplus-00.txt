           HPCC++: Enhanced High Precision Congestion Control
                      draft-pan-tsvwg-hpccplus-00

Abstract

   Congestion control (CC) is the key to achieving ultra-low latency,
   high bandwidth and network stability in high-speed networks.
   However, the existing high-speed CC schemes have inherent limitations
   for reaching these goals.

   In this document, we describe HPCC++ (High Precision Congestion
   Control), a new high-speed CC mechanism which achieves the three
   goals simultaneously.  HPCC++ leverages in-network telemetry (INT) to
   obtain precise link load information and controls traffic precisely.
   By addressing challenges such as delayed INT information during
   congestion and overreaction to INT information, HPCC++ can quickly
   converge to utilize free bandwidth while avoiding congestion, and can
   maintain near-zero in-network queues for ultra-low latency.  HPCC++
   is also fair and easy to deploy in hardware, implementable with
   commodity programmable NICs and switches.

1.  Introduction

   The link speed in data center networks has grown from 1Gbps to
   100Gbps in the past decade, and this growth is continuing.  Ultralow
   latency and high bandwidth, which are demanded by more and more
   applications, are two critical requirements in today's and future
   high-speed networks.

   Given that traditional software-based network stacks in hosts can no
   longer sustain the critical latency and bandwidth requirements
   [Zhu-SIGCOMM2015], offloading network stacks into hardware is an
   inevitable direction in high-speed networks.  large-scale networks
   with RDMA (remote direct memory access) over Converged Ethernet
   Version 2 (RoCEv2) often becomes hardware-offloading solution.
   Unfortunately, the RDMA networks still face fundamental challenges to
   reconcile low latency, high bandwidth utilization, and high
   stability.

   This document describes a new CC mechanism, HPCC++ (Enhanced High
   Precision Congestion Control), for large-scale, high-speed networks.
   The key idea behind HPCC++ is to leverage the precise link load
   information from INT to compute accurate flow rate updates.  Unlike
   existing approaches that often require a large number of iterations
   to find the proper flow rates, HPCC++ requires only one rate update
   step in most cases.  Using precise information from INT enables
   HPCC++ to address the three limitations in current CC schemes.
   First, HPCC++ senders can quickly ramp up flow rates for high
   utilization or ramp down flow rates for congestion avoidance.
   Second, HPCC++ senders can quickly adjust the flow rates to keep each
   link's input rate slightly lower than the link's capacity, preventing
   queues from being built-up as well as preserving high link
   utilization.  Finally, since sending rates are computed precisely
   based on direct measurements at switches, HPCC++ requires merely
   three independent parameters that are used to tune fairness and
   efficiency.

   The base form of HPCC++ is the original HPCC algorithm and its full
   description can be found in [SIGCOMM-HPCC].  While the original
   design lays the foundation for INT-based precision congestion
   control, HPCC++ is an enhanced version which takes into account
   system constraints and aims to reduce the design overhead and further
   improves the performance.  Section 6 describes these detailed
   proposed design enhancements and guidelines.

3.  System Overview

   Figure 1 shows the end-to-end system that HPCC++ operates in.  During
   the propagation of the packet from the sender to the receiver, each
   switch along the path leverages the INT feature of its switching ASIC
   to insert some meta-data that reports the current load of the
   packet's egress port, including timestamp (ts), queue length (qLen),
   transmitted bytes (txBytes), and the link bandwidth capacity (B).
   When the receiver gets the packet, it can copies all the meta-data
   recorded by the switches to the ACK message it sends back to the
   sender, and then the sender decides how to adjust its flow rate each
   time it receives an ACK with network load information.
   Alternatively, the receiver can calculate the flow rate based on the
   INT information and feedback the calculated rate back to the sender.
   The nofication packets would include delayed ack information as well.

   Note that there also exist network nodes along the reverse
   (potentially uncongested) path that the RTCP feedback reports
   traverse.  Those network nodes are not shown in the figure for sake
   of brevity.

   o  Data sender: responsible for controlling inflight bytes.  HPCC++
      is a window-based CC scheme that controls the number of inflight
      bytes.  The inflight bytes mean the amount of data that have been
      sent, but not acknowledged at the sender yet.  Controlling
      inflight bytes has an important advantage compared to controlling
      rates.  In the absence of congestion, the inflight bytes and rate
      are interchangeable with equation inflight = rate * T where T is
      the base propagation RTT.  The rate can be calculated locally or
      obtained from the notification packet.

   o  Network nodes: responsible of inserting the INT information to the
      data packet.  The INT information reports the current load of the
      packet's egress port, including timestamp (ts), queue length
      (qLen), transmitted bytes (txBytes), and the link bandwidth

      capacity (B).  Note that the INT information can be nested with
      each network node adds its own information or more capable network
      nodes may compare its INT information against the one in the
      packet header.  If its congestion is more severe, the node may
      replace the packet's INT information with its own.

   o  Data receiver: responsible for either reflecting back the INT
      information in the data packet using ACKs or calculating the
      proper flow rate based on network congestion information in INT
      and sending notification packets back to the sender.

4.  HPCC++ Algorithm

   HPCC++ is a window-based congestion control algorithm.  The key
   design choice of HPCC++ is to rely on network nodes to provide fine-
   grained load information, such as queue size and accumulated tx/rx
   traffic to compute precise flow rates.  This has two major benefits:
   (i) HPCC++ can quickly converge to proper flow rates to highly
   utilize bandwidth while avoiding congestion; and (ii) HPCC++ can
   consistently maintain a close-to-zero queue for low latency.

   This section introduces the list of notations and describes the core
   congestion control algorithm.

4.2.  Design Functions and Procedures

   The HPCC++ algorithm can be outlined as below:

   1:    Function MeasureInflight(ack)
   2:    u = 0;
   3:    for each link i on the path do
   4:              ack.L[i].txBytes-L[i].txBytes
         txRate =  ----------------------------- ;
                       ack.L[i].ts-L[i].ts
   5:          min(ack.L[i].qlen,L[i].qlen)      txRate
         u' = ----------------------------- +  ---------- ;
                   ack.L[i].B*T                ack.L[i].B
   6:    if u' > u then
   7:       u = u'; tau = ack.L[i].ts -  L[i].ts;
   8:    tau = min(tau, T);
   9:    U = (1 - tau/T)*U + tau/T*u;
   10:   return U;

   11:   Function ComputeWind(U, updateWc)
   12:   if U >= eta or incStage >= maxStagee then
   13:           Wc
            W = ----- + W_ai;
                U/eta
   14:   if updateWc then
   15:      incStagee = 0; Wc = W ;
   16:   else
   17:      W = Wc + W_ai ;
   18:      if updateWc then
   19:         incStage++; Wc = W ;
   20:   return W

   21:   Procedure NewAck(ack)
   22:   if ack.seq > lastUpdateSeq then
   23:      W = ComputeWind(MeasureInflight(ack), True);
   24:      lastUpdateSeq = snd_nxt;
   25:   else
   26:      W = ComputeWind(MeasureInflight(ack), False);
   27:   R = W/T; L = ack.L;

   The above illustrates the overall process of CC at the sender side
   for a single flow.  Each newly received ACK message triggers the
   procedure NewACK at Line 21.  At Line 22, the variable lastUpdateSeq
   is used to remember the first packet sent with a new W c , and the
   sequence number in the incoming ACK should be larger than
   lastUpdateSeq to trigger a new sync betweenW c andW (Line 14-15 and
   18-19).  The sender also remembers the pacing rate and current INT
   information at Line 27.  The sender computes a new window size W at
   Line 23 or Line 26, depending on whether to update W c , with
   function MeasureInflight and ComputeWind.  Function MeasureInflight
   estimates normalized inflight bytes with Eqn (2) at Line 5.  First,
   it computes txRate of each link from the current and last accumulated
   transferred bytes txBytes and timestamp ts (Line 4).  It also uses
   the minimum of the current and last qlen to filter out noises in qlen
   (Line 5).  The loop from Line 3 to 7 selects maxi(Ui) in Eqn. (3).
   Instead of directly using maxi(Ui), we use an EWMA (Exponentially
   Weighted Moving Average) to filter the noises from timer inaccuracy
   and transient queues.  (Line 9).  Function ComputeWind combines
   multiplicative increase/ decrease (MI/MD) and additive increase (AI)
   to balance the reaction speed and fairness.  If a sender finds it
   should increase the window size, it first tries AI for maxStage times
   with the stepWAI (Line 17).  If it still finds room to increase after
   maxStage times of AI or the normalized inflight bytes is above, it
   calls Eqn (4) once to quickly ramp up or ramp down the window size
   (Line 12-13).

5.  Configuration Parameters

   HPCC++ has three easy-to-set parameters: eta, maxStagee, and W_ai.
   eta controls a simple tradeoff between utilization and transient
   queue length (due to the temporary collision of packets caused by
   their random arrivals, so we set it to 95% by default, which only
   loses 5% bandwidth but achieves almost zero queue.  maxStage controls
   a simple tradeoff between steady state stability and the speed to
   reclaim free bandwidth.  We find maxStage = 5 is conservatively large
   for stability, while the speed of reclaiming free bandwidth is still
   much faster than traditional additive increase, especially in high
   bandwidth networks.  W_ai controls the tradeoff between the maximum
   number of concurrent flows on a link that can sustain near-zero

   queues and the speed of convergence to fairness.  Note that none of
   the three parameters are reliability-critical.

   HPCC++'s design intentionally brings advantages to short-lived flows,
   by allowing flows starting at line-rate and the separation of
   utilization convergence and fairness convergence.  HPCC++ achieves
   fast utilization convergence to mitigate congestion in almost one
   round-trip time, while allows flows to gradually converge to
   fairness.  This design choice is especially helpful for the workload
   of datacenter applications, where the majority of flows are short and
   latency-sensitive.  Normally we set a very small W_ai to support a
   large number of concurrent flows on a link, because slower fairness
   is not critical.  A rule of thumb is to set W_ai = W_init*(1-eta) / N
   where N is the expected or receiver reported maximum number of
   concurrent flows on a link.  The intuition is that the total additive
   increase every round (N*W_ai ) should not exceed the bandwidth
   headroom, and thus no queue forms.  Even if the actual number of
   concurrent flows on a link exceeds N, the CC is still stable and
   achieves full utilization, but just cannot maintain zero queues.

6.  Design Enhancement and Implementation

   The basic design of HPCC++, i.e. HPCC, as described above is to add
   INT information into every date packet to response congestion as soon
   as the very first packet observing the network congestion.  This is
   especially helpful to reduce the risk of severe congestion in incast
   scenario at the first round-trip time.  In addition, original HPCC's
   algorithm of introducing Wc is for the purpose of solving the over-
   reaction issue from using this per-packet response.

   Alternatively, the INT information needs not to be added to every
   data packet to reduce the overhead.  Switches can generate INT less
   frequently, e.g., once per RTT or upon congestion happening.

6.1.  HPCC++ Guidelines

   To ensure network stability, HPCC++ establishes a few guidelines for
   different implementations:

   o  The algorithm should commit the window/rate update at most once
      per round-trip time, similar to the procedure of updating Wc.

   o  To support different workloads and to properly set W_ai, HPCC++
      allows the option to incorporate mechanisms to speed up the
      fairness convergence.

   o  The switch should capture INT information that includes link load
      (txBytes, ts, qlen) and link spec (switch ID, egress port ID, port



Liu, et al.             Expires December 19, 2020               [Page 8]

      speed) at the egress port.  Note, each switch should record all
      those information at the single snapshot to achieve a precise link
      load estimate.

   o  HPCC++ can optionally use a probe packet to query the INT
      information.  Thereby, the probe packets should take the same
      routing path and QoS queueing with the data packets.

   As long the above guidelines are met, this document does not mandate
   a particular INT header format or encapsulation, which are orthogonal
   to the HPCC++ algorithms described in this document.  The algorithm
   can be implemented with a choice of in-band network telemetry
   [P4-INT], [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data], [I-D.ietf-kumar-ippm-ifa].

6.2.  Receiver-based HPCC

   Note that the window/rate calculation can be implemented at either
   the data sender or the data receiver.  If the ACK packets already
   exist for reliability purpose, the INT information can be echoed back
   to the sender via ACK self-clocking.  Not all ACK packets need to
   carry the INT information.  To reduce the Packet Per Second (PPS)
   overhead, the receiver may examine the INT information and adopt the
   technique of delayed ACKs that only sends out an ACK for a few of
   received packets.  In order to reduce PPS even further, one may
   implement the algorithm at the receiver and feedback the calculated
   window in the ACK packet once every RTT.

   The receiver-based algorithm, Rx-HPCC, is based on int.L, which is
   the INT information in the packet header.  The receiver performs the
   same functions except using int.L instead of ack.L.  The new function
   NewINT(int.L) is to replace NewACK(int.L)

   28:   Procedure NewINT(int.L)
   29:   if now > (lastUpdateTime + T) then
   30:      W = ComputeWind(MeasureInflight(int), True);
   31:      send_ack(W)
   32:      lastUpdateTime = now;
   33:   else
   34:      W = ComputeWind(MeasureInflight(int), False);

   Here, since the receiver does not know the starting sequence number
   of a burst, it simply records the lastUpdateTime.  If time T has
   passed since lastUpdateTime, the algorithm would recalcuate Wc as in
   Line 30 and send out the ACK packet which would include W informtion.
   Otherwise, it would just update W information locally.  This would
   reduce the amount of traffic that needs to be feedback to the data
   sender.

   Note that the receiver can also measure the number of outstanding
   flows, N, if the last hop is the congestion point and use this
   information to dynamically adjust W_ai to achieve better fairness.
   The improvement would allow flows to quickly converge to fairness
   without causing large swings under heavy load.

6.3.  Switch-side Optimizations

   Switches can potentially generate and send separate packets
   containing INT information (aka INT response packets) directly back
   to the data senders so that they can slow down as soon as possible.
   This fast feedback and reaction can further reduce buffer size
   consumption upon heavy incast.  Switches can consider the level of
   congestion to decide when to trigger direct INT responses.  A simple
   bloom-filter and timer can be used at switches to avoid sending a
   burst of INT responses to the same sender.  An INT response packet
   must carry the sequence number of the original data packet, so that
   the sender can correctly correlate the INT response with the data
   packet triggered the INT response.

   One may optimize the INT header overhead by implementing a simple
   subscription-based INT.  The data senders may simply use a different
   DSCP codepoint or a flag bit in the INT instruction header to
   indicate INT subscription.  (We expect future INT specs to support
   such a subscription service.)  The senders can selectively subscribe
   to INT on a per-packet basis to control the INT data overhead.  While
   forwarding INT-subscribed data packets, the switches can monitor the
   level of congestion and conditionally generate separate INT responses
   as described above.  The INT responses can be directly sent back to
   the senders or to the receivers depending on which version of HPCC++
   algorithm (sender-based or receiver-based) is used in the network.

7.  Reference Implementations

7.1.  INT padding at switches

   HPCC++ only relies on packets to share information across senders,
   receivers, and switches.  HPCC++ is open to a variety of INT format
   standards.  Inside a data center, the path length is often no more
   than 5 hops.  The overhead of the INT padding for HPCC++ is low.

7.2.  Congestion control at NICs

   Figure 4 shows HPCC++ implementation on a commodity programmable NIC.
   The NIC provides an FPGA chip which is connected to the main memory
   with a vendor-provided PCIe module and the Ethernet adapter with a
   vendor-provided MAC module.  Sitting between the PCIe and MAC
   modules, HPCC++ modules realize both sender and receiver roles.

   The Congestion Control (CC) module implements the sender side CC
   algorithm.  It receives ACK events which are generated from the RX
   pipeline, adjusts the sending window and rate, and stores the new

   sending window and rate for the flow of the current ACK in the flow
   scheduler via an Update event.

   The flow scheduler paces flow rates with a credit-based mechanism.
   Specifically, it scans through all the flows in a round-robin manner
   and assigns credit to each flow proportional to its current pacing
   rate.  It also maintains the current sending window size and
   unacknowledged packets for active flows.  If a flow has accumulated
   sufficient credits to send one packet and the flow's sending window
   permits, the flow scheduler invokes a PktSend event to TX pipe.

   The TX pipe implements IB/UDP/IP stacks for running in RoCEv2.  It
   maintains the flow context for each of concurrent flows, including
   5-tuples, the packet sequence number (PSN), destination QP (queue
   pair), etc.  Once it receives the PktSend event with QP ID from the
   flow scheduler, it generates the corresponding packet and delivers to
   the MAC module.

   The RX pipe parses the incoming packets from the MAC module and
   generates multiple events to other HPCC++ modules. (1) On receiving a
   data packet, the RX pipe extracts its flow context and invokes a
   PktRecv event to the TX pipe to formulate a corresponding ACK packet.
   If the packet is out-of-sequence (OOS), the TX pipe sends a NAK
   instead. (2) On receiving an ACK packet, the RX pipe extracts the
   network status from the packet and passes it to the CC module via the
   flow scheduler. (3) On receiving a NAK, the RX pipe notifies the TX
   pipe to start go-back-to-N retransmission. (4) On receiving a control
   packet with an RDMA operation, the RX pipe notifies the flow
   scheduler to create a flow with a new QP ID, or remove an existing
   flow.  Currently, HPCC++ supports two operations: RDMA WRITE and RDMA
   READ.  We leave the full support of IB verbs as future work.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   The rate adaptation mechanism in HPCC++ relies on feedback from the
   data receiver.  As such, it is vulnerable to attacks where feedback
   messages are hijacked, replaced, or intentionally injected with
   misleading information resulting in denial of service, similar to
   those that can affect TCP.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that the
   notification feedback message is at least integrity checked.  In
   addition, [I-D.ietf-avtcore-cc-feedback-message] discusses the
   potential risk of a receiver providing misleading congestion feedback
   information and the mechanisms for mitigating such risks.
