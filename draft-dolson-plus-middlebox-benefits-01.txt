                  Beneficial Functions of Middleboxes
                draft-dolson-plus-middlebox-benefits-01

Abstract

   At IETF97, at a meeting regarding the Path Layer UDP Substrate (PLUS)
   protocol, a request was made for documentation about the benefits
   that might be provided by permitting middleboxes to have some
   visibility to transport-layer information.

   This document summarizes benefits provided to the Internet by
   middleboxes -- intermediary devices that provide functions apart from
   normal IP routing between a source and destination host [RFC3234].

   RFC3234 defines a taxonomy of middleboxes and issues in the internet
   circa 2002.  Most of those middleboxes utilized or modified
   application-layer data.  This document will focus primarily on
   devices that observe and act on information found in the transport
   layer, most commonly TCP at this time.

   A primary goal of this document is to provide information to working
   groups developing new transport protocols, in particular the PLUS and
   QUIC working groups, to aid understanding of what might be gained or
   lost by design decisions.

Internet-Draft     Beneficial Functions of Middleboxes      January 2017


1.  Introduction

   From RFC3234 [RFC3234], "A middlebox is defined as any intermediary
   device performing functions other than the normal, standard functions
   of an IP router on the datagram path between a source host and
   destination host."

   Middleboxes are usually (but not exclusively) deployed at locations
   permitting observation of bidirectional traffic flows.  This is
   typically at the point a stub network connects to the internet:

   o  Where a residential or business customer connects to the service
      provider.

   o  Where a mobile home gateway connects to the internet.

   The QUIC working group and PLUS BoF are debating the appropriate
   amount of information that end-points should expose to on-path
   network middleboxes and human operators.  This document itemizes a
   variety of features provided by middleboxes and by ad hoc analysis
   performed by operators using packet analyzers.

   Many of the techniques described in this document require stateful
   analysis of transport streams.  A generic state machine is described
   in [I-D.trammell-plus-statefulness].

   Although many middleboxes observe and manipulate application-layer
   content they are out of scope for this document, the aim being to
   describe benefits of transport-layer features.  Application-layer
   content should be encrypted and/or authenticated, whereas we hope to
   provide motivation to make transport connections managable from the
   network.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Measurements

   A number of measurements can be made by network devices that are
   either in-line with the traffic (responsible for forwarding) or
   receiving off-line copy of traffic from a tap or file capture.  These
   measurements can be used either in automated systems, or for manual
   network troubleshooting (e.g., using packet analysis tools such as
   Wireshark).  The automated devices can further be classified as
   monitoring devices that compute these metrics for large amounts of



Dolson & Snellman        Expires August 4, 2017                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     Beneficial Functions of Middleboxes      January 2017


   connections and generate aggregated reports from them, and active
   devices that make decisions on how to handle specific packets based
   on these metrics.

   Long-term trends in these measurements can aid an operator in
   capacity planning.  Short-term anomalies in these measurements can
   identify network breakages, attacks in progress or misbehaving
   devices/applications.

2.1.  Packet Loss

   Network problems and under-provisioning can be detected if packet
   loss is measurable.  TCP packet loss can be detected by observing
   gaps in sequence numbers, retransmitted sequence numbers, and SACK
   options.  Packet loss can be detected per direction.

   Gaps indicate loss upstream of the tap point; retransmissions
   indicate loss downstream of the tap.  Selective acknowledgements
   (SACKs) can be used to detect either form of packet loss (although
   some care needs to be taken to avoid mis-identifying packet
   reordering as packet loss), and to distinguish between upstream vs.
   downstream losses.

   Packet loss measurements on both sides of the measurement point are
   an important component in precisely diagnosing insufficiently
   dimensioned devices or links in networks.  Additionally since packet
   losses are one of the two main ways for congestion to manifest,
   packet loss is an important measurement for any middlebox that needs
   to make traffic handling decisions based on observed levels of
   congestion.

2.2.  Round Trip Times

   A TCP packet stream can be used to measure the round-trip time on
   each side of the measurement point.  During the connection handshake,
   the SYN, SYNACK, and ACK timings can be used to establish a baseline
   RTT in each direction.  Once the connection is established, the RTT
   between the server and the measurement point can only reliably be
   determined using TCP timestamps.  On the side between the measurement
   point and the client, the exact timing of data segments and ACKs can
   be used as an alternative.  For this latter method to be accurate
   when packet loss is present, the connection must use selective
   acknowledgements.

   In many kinds of networks, congestion will show up as queueing, and
   congestion-induced packet loss will only happen in extreme cases.
   RTTs will also show up as a much smoother signal than the discrete
   packet loss events.  This makes RTTs a good way to identify



Dolson & Snellman        Expires August 4, 2017                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     Beneficial Functions of Middleboxes      January 2017


   individual subscribers for whom the network is a bottleneck at a
   given time, or geographical sites (such as cellular towers) that are
   experiencing large scale congestion.

   The main limit of RTT measurement as a congestion signal is the
   difficulty of reliably distinguishing between the data segments being
   queued vs. the ACKs being queued.

2.3.  Measuring Packet Reordering

   If a network is reordering packets of transport connections, caused
   perhaps by ECMP misconfiguration (e.g., described in [RFC2991] and
   [RFC7690]) the end-points may react as though packet loss is
   occurring and retransmit packets or reduce forwarding rates.  It is
   therefore beneficial to be able to diagnose packet reordering from
   within a network.

   For TCP, packet reordering can be detected by observing TCP sequence
   numbers per direction.  See, for example a number of standard packet
   reordering metrics in [RFC4737] and informational metrics in
   [RFC5236].

2.4.  Throughput and Bottleneck Identification

   Although throughput to or from an IP address can be measured without
   transport-layer measurements, the transport layer provides clues
   about what the end-points were attempting to do.

   One way of quickly excluding the network as the bottleneck during
   troubleshooting is to check whether the speed is limited by the
   endpoints.  For example the connection speed might instead be limited
   by suboptimal TCP options, the sender's congestion window, the sender
   temporarily running out of data to send, the sender waiting for the
   receiver to send another request, or the receiver closing the receive
   window.

   This data is also useful for middleboxes used to measure network
   quality of service.  Connections, or portions of connections, that
   are limited by the endpoints do not provide an accurate measure of
   network's speed, and can be discounted or completely excluded in such
   analyses.

2.5.  DDoS Detection

   When an application or network resource is under attack, it is useful
   to identify this situation from the network perspective, upstream of
   the attacked resource.

Internet-Draft     Beneficial Functions of Middleboxes      January 2017


   Although detection methods tend to be proprietary, DDoS attack
   detection is fundamentally one of:

   o  detecting protocol violations by tracking the transport-layer
      state machine or application-layer messaging; or

   o  anomaly detection by noticing atypical traffic patterns taken from
      measurements.

   Two trends in protocol design will make DDoS detection more
   difficult:

   o  the desire to encrypt transport-layer communication and sequence
      numbers;

   o  the desire to avoid statistical fingerprinting by adding entropy
      in various forms.

   Those desires assist in the worthy goal of improved privacy, but also
   serve to defeat DDoS detection.

2.6.  Packet Corruption

   One notable source of packet loss is packet corruption.  This
   corruption will generally not be detected until the checksums are
   validated by the endpoint, and the packet is dropped.  This means
   that detecting the exact location where packets are lost is not
   sufficient when troubleshooting networks.  It should also be possible
   to find out where packets are being corrupted.  IP and TCP checksum
   verification allows a measurement device to correctly distinguish
   between upstream packet corruption and normal downstream packet loss.

   QUIC and PLUS designers should consider whether a middlebox will be
   able to detect corrupted or tampered packets.

2.7.  Application-Layer Measurements

   Network health may also be gleaned from application-layer diagnosis.
   E.g.,

   o  DNS response times and retransmissions by correlating answers to
      queries.

   o  Various protocol-aware voice and video quality analysis.

   Could this type of information be provided in a transport layer?

3.  Actions

   This section describes features provided by in-line devices that
   modify, discard, delay, or prioritize traffic.

3.1.  NAT

   Network Address Translators (NATs) allow multiple devices to share a
   public address by dividing the transport-layer port space among the
   devices.

   NAT behavior recommendations are found for UDP in BCP 127 [RFC4787]
   and for TCP in BCP 142 [RFC7857].

   To support NAT, there must be transport-layer port numbers that can
   be modified by the network.  The application-layer must not assume
   the port number was unchanged (e.g., by including it in a checksum or
   signing it).

3.2.  Firewall

   Firewalls are a pervasive and essential component of making a network
   secure.  Arguably many users within various types of organizations
   would not have been granted internet access if not for firewalls.

   An important aspect of firewall policy is differentiating internally-
   initiated from externally-initiated communications.

      For TCP, this is easily done by tracking the TCP state machine.
      Furthermore, the ending of a TCP connection is indicated by RST or
      FIN flags.

      For UDP, the firewall can be opened if the first packet comes from
      an internal user, but the closing is generally done by an idle
      timer of arbitrary duration, which might not match the
      expectations of the application.

   A firewall functions better when it can observe the protocol state
   machine, described generally by Transport-Independent Path Layer
   State Management [I-D.trammell-plus-statefulness].

3.3.  DDoS Scrubbing

   In the context of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the
   purpose of a scrubber is to discard attack traffic while permitting
   useful traffic.





Dolson & Snellman        Expires August 4, 2017                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     Beneficial Functions of Middleboxes      January 2017


   When attacks occur against constrained resources, there is obviously
   a huge benefit in being able to scrub well.

   Futhermore, this is solely a task for an on-path network device
   because neither end-point of a legitimate connection has any control
   over the source of the attack traffic.

   Source-spoofed DDoS attacks can be mitigated at the source using BCP
   38 ([RFC2827]), but it is more difficult if source address filtering
   cannot be applied.

   In contrast to devices in the core of the Internet, middleboxes
   statefully observing bidirectional transport connections can reject
   source-spoofed TCP traffic based on inability to provide sensible
   acknowledgement numbers to complete the three-way handshake.
   Obviously this requires middlebox visibility into transport-layer
   state machine.

   Middleboxes may also scrub on the basis of statistical
   classification: testing how likely a given packet is legitimate.  As
   protocol designers add more entropy to headers and lengths, this test
   becomes less useful and the best scrubbing strategy becomes random
   drop.

3.4.  Performance-Enhancing Proxies

   Performance-Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) can improve network performance
   by improving packet spacing or generating local acknowledgements, and
   are most commonly used in satellite and cellular networks.
   Transport-Layer PEPs are described in section 2.1.1 of [RFC3135].

   PEPs allow central deployment of congestion control algorithms more
   suited to the specific network, most commonly use of delay-based
   congestion control.  More advanced TCP PEPs deploy congestion control
   systems that treat all of a single subscriber's TCP connections as a
   single unit, improving fairness and allowing faster reaction to
   changing network conditions.

   Local acknowledgements generated by PEPs speed up TCP slow start by
   splitting the effective latency, and allow for retransmissions to be
   done from the PEP rather than from the actual sender, saving downlink
   bandwidth on retransmissions.  Local acknowledgements will also allow
   a PEP to maintain a local buffer of data appropriate to the actual
   network conditions, whereas the actual endpoints would often send too
   much or too little.

   A PEP function requires transport-layer fields that allow chunks of
   data to be identified (e.g., TCP sequence numbers), acknowledgements



Dolson & Snellman        Expires August 4, 2017                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     Beneficial Functions of Middleboxes      January 2017


   to be identified (e.g., TCP ack numbers), and acknowledgements to be
   created from the PEP.

3.5.  Bandwidth Aggregation

   The Hybrid Access Aggregation Point (HAAP) is a middlebox that allows
   customers to aggregate the bandwidth of multiple access technologies
   [I-D.zhang-banana-problem-statement].

   One of the approaches uses MPTCP proxies to divide the traffic along
   multiple paths.  The MPTCP proxy operates at the transport layer
   while being located in the operator's network.

3.6.  Prioritization

   Bulk traffic may be served with a higher latency than interactive
   traffic with no reduction in throughput.  This fact allows a
   middlebox function that improves response time in interactive
   applications by prioritizing interactive transport connections over
   bulk traffic transport connections.  E.g., gaming traffic may be
   prioritized above email or software updates.

3.7.  Measurement-Based Shaping

   Basic traffic shaping functionality requires no transport-layer
   information.  All that is needed is a way of mapping each packet to a
   traffic shaper quota.  For example, there may be a rate limit per
   5-tuple or per subscriber IP address.  However, such fixed traffic
   shaping rules are wasteful as they end up rate limiting traffic even
   when the network has free resources available.

   More advanced traffic shaping devices use transport layer metrics
   described in Section 2 to detect congestion on either a per-site or
   per-user level, and use different traffic shaping rules when
   congestion is detected.  This type of device can overcome limitations
   of down-stream devices that behave poorly (e.g., by excessive
   buffering or sub-optimzally dropping packets).

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Confidentiality

   This document intentionally excludes middleboxes that observe or
   manipulate application-layer data.

   The benefits described in this document can all be implemented
   without violating confidentiality.  However, there is always the
   question of whether the fields and packet properties used to achieve
   these benefits may also be used for harm.

   In particular, we want to ask what confidentiality is lost by
   exposing transport-layer fields beyond what can be learned by
   observing IP-layer fields.

   Sequence numbers: an observer can learn how much data is transferred.

   Start/Stop indicators: an observer can count transactions for some
   applications.

   Device fingerprinting: an observer may be more easily able to
   identify a device type when different devices use different default
   field values or options.

5.2.  Active Attacks

   Being able to observe sequence numbers or session identifiers may
   make it easier to modify or terminate a transport connection.  E.g.,
   observing TCP sequence numbers allows generation of a RST packet that
   terminates the connection.  However, signing transport fields
   mitigates this attack.  The attack and solution are described for the
   TCP authentication option [RFC5925].

5.3.  More Information Can Improve Security

   Proposition: network maintainability and security can be improved by
   providing firewalls and DDoS mechanisms with some information about
   transport connections.  In contrast, it would be very difficult to
   secure a network in which every packet appears unique and filled with
   random bits.

   For denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on bandwidth, the receiving end-
   point is usually on the wrong side of the constrained network link.
   This fact makes it seem reasonable to give some clues to allow a
   middlebox device to help out before the constrained link.

   E.g., in a blind attack, an attacker cannot receive data from the
   target of the attack (section 4.6.3.2 of [RFC3552]).  In the case of
   TCP, the blind attacker cannot complete the three-way handshake.

Internet-Draft     Beneficial Functions of Middleboxes      January 2017


   In the balance, some features providing the ability to mitigate/
   filter attacks and fix broken networks will improve security vs. the
   scenario when all packets are completely opaque.
