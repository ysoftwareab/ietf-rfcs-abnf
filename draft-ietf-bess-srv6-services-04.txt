1.  Introduction

   SRv6 refers to Segment Routing [RFC8402] instantiated on the IPv6
   dataplane [RFC8754].

   SRv6 based BGP services refers to the L3 and L2 overlay services with
   BGP as control plane and SRv6 as dataplane.

   SRv6 SID refers to a SRv6 Segment Identifier as defined in [RFC8402].

   SRv6 Service SID refers to an SRv6 SID associated with one of the
   service specific behavior on the advertising Provider Edge (PE)
   router, such as (but not limited to), END.DT (Table lookup in a VRF)
   or END.DX (cross-connect to a nexthop) behaviors in the case of L3VPN
   service as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming].

   To provide SRv6 service with best-effort connectivity, the egress PE
   signals an SRv6 Service SID with the BGP overlay service route.  The
   ingress PE encapsulates the payload in an outer IPv6 header where the
   destination address is the SRv6 Service SID provided by the egress
   PE.  The underlay between the PEs only need to support plain IPv6
   forwarding [RFC8200].

   To provide SRv6 service in conjunction with an underlay SLA from the
   ingress PE to the egress PE, the egress PE colors the overlay service
   route with a Color extended community
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].  The ingress PE
   encapsulates the payload packet in an outer IPv6 header with the
   segment list of SR policy associated with the related SLA followed by
   the SRv6 Service SID associated with the route.  The underlay nodes
   whose SRv6 SID's are part of the segment list MUST support SRv6 data
   plane.

   BGP is used to advertise the reachability of prefixes of a particular
   service from an egress PE to ingress PE nodes.

   This document describes how existing BGP messages between PEs may
   carry SRv6 Service SIDs as a means to interconnect PEs and form VPNs.

   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  SRv6 Services TLVs

   This document extends the BGP Prefix-SID attribute [RFC8669] to carry
   SRv6 SIDs and associated information.

   The SRv6 Service TLVs are defined as two new TLVs of the BGP Prefix-
   SID Attribute to achieve signaling of SRv6 SIDs for L3 and L2
   services.

   o  SRv6 L3 Service TLV: This TLV encodes Service SID information for
      SRv6 based L3 services.  It corresponds to the equivalent
      functionality provided by an MPLS Label when received with a Layer
      3 service route.  Some behaviors which MAY be encoded, but not
      limited to, are End.DX4, End.DT4, End.DX6, End.DT6, etc.

   o  SRv6 L2 Service TLV: This TLV encodes Service SID information for
      SRv6 based L2 services.  It corresponds to the equivalent
      functionality provided by an MPLS Label1 for EVPN Route-Types as
      defined in[RFC7432].  Some behaviors which MAY be encoded, but not
      limited to, are End.DX2, End.DX2V, End.DT2U, End.DT2M etc.

   When an egress PE is enabled for BGP Services over SRv6 data-plane,
   it MUST signal one or more SRv6 Service SIDs enclosed in SRv6 Service
   TLV(s) within the BGP Prefix-SID Attribute attached to MP-BGP NLRIs
   defined in [RFC4760] [RFC4659] [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc5549revision]
   [RFC7432] [RFC4364] where applicable as described in Section 5 and
   Section 6.

   The following depicts the SRv6 Service TLVs encoded in the BGP
   Prefix-SID Attribute:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   TLV Type    |         TLV Length            |   RESERVED    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      //  SRv6 Service Sub-TLVs                                      //
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  TLV Type (1 octet): This field is assigned values from the IANA
      registry "BGP Prefix-SID TLV Types".  It is set to 5 for SRv6 L3
      Service TLV.  It is set to 6 for SRv6 L2 Service TLV.

   o  TLV Length (2 octets): Specifies the total length of the TLV
      Value.

   o  RESERVED (1 octet): This field is reserved; it SHOULD be set to 0
      by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   o  SRv6 Service Sub-TLVs (variable): This field contains SRv6 Service
      related information and is encoded as an unordered list of Sub-
      TLVs whose format is described below.

   A BGP speaker receiving a route containing BGP Prefix-SID Attribute
   with one or more SRv6 Service TLVs observes the following rules when
   advertising the received route to other peers:

   o  if the nexthop is unchanged during advertisement, the SRv6 Service
      TLVs, including any unrecognized Types of Sub-TLV and Sub-Sub-TLV,
      SHOULD be propagated further.  In addition, all Reserved fields in
      the TLV or Sub-TLV or Sub-Sub-TLV MUST be propagated unchanged.

   o  if the nexthop is changed, the TLVs, Sub-TLVs and Sub-Sub-TLVs
      SHOULD be updated as appropriate.  Any unrecognized received sub-
      TLVs and Sub-Sub-TLVs MUST be removed.

3.  SRv6 Service Sub-TLVs

   The format of a single SRv6 Service Sub-TLV is depicted below:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   o  SRv6 Service Sub-TLV Type (1 octet): Identifies the type of SRv6
      service information.  It is assigned values from the IANA Registry
      "SRv6 Service Sub-TLV Types".

   o  SRv6 Service Sub-TLV Length (2 octets): Specifies the total length
      of the Sub-TLV Value field.

   o  SRv6 Service Sub-TLV Value (variable): Contains data specific to
      the Sub-TLV Type.  In addition to fixed length data, it contains
      other properties of the SRv6 Service encoded as a set of SRv6
      Service Data Sub-Sub-TLVs whose format is described in Section 3.2
      below.

   o  SRv6 Service Data Sub-Sub-TLV Type (1 octet): This field is set to
      1 to represent SRv6 SID Structure Sub-Sub-TLV.

   o  SRv6 Service Data Sub-Sub-TLV Length (2 octets): This field
      contains the total length of 6 bytes.

   o  Locator Block Length (1 octet): Contains length of SRv6 SID
      locator Block in bits.

   o  Locator Node Length (1 octet): Contains length of SRv6 SID locator

   o  Transposition Length (1 octet): Size in bits for the part of SID
      that has been transposed (or shifted) into a label field

   o  Transposition Offset (1 octet): The offset position in bits for
      the part of SID that has been transposed (or shifted) into a label
      field.

   Section 4 describes mechanisms for signaling of the SRv6 Service SID
   by transposing a variable part of the SRv6 SID value (function and/or
   the argument parts) and carrying them in existing label fields to
   achieve more efficient packing of those service prefix NLRIs in BGP
   update messages.  The SRv6 SID Structure Sub-Sub-TLV contains
   appropriate length fields when the SRv6 Service SID is signaled in
   split parts to enable the receiver to put together the SID
   accurately.

Internet-Draft       SRv6 BGP based Overlay Services           July 2020


   Transposition Offset indicates the bit position and Transposition
   Length indicates the number of bits that are being taken out of the
   SRv6 SID value and put into high order bits of label field.  The bits
   that have been shifted out MUST be set to 0 in the SID value.

   Transposition Length of 0 indicates nothing is transposed and that
   the entire SRv6 SID value is encoded in the SID Information sub-TLV.
   In this case, the Transposition Offset MUST be set to 0.

   Since size of label field is 24 bits, only that many bits can be
   transposed from the SRv6 SID value into it.

   As an example, when the entire function part of size 16 of an SRv6
   SID is transposed and the sum of the locator block and locator node
   parts is 64, then the transposition offset would be set to 64 and the
   transposition length is set to 16.

   BGP speakers that do not support this specification may misinterpret,
   on reception of an SRv6-based BGP service route update, the function
   and/or argument parts of the SRv6 SID encoded in label field(s) as
   MPLS label values for MPLS-based services.  Implementations
   supporting this specification SHOULD provide a mechanism to control
   advertisement of SRv6-based BGP service routes on a per neighbor and
   per service basis.

   Arguments MAY be generally applicable for SIDs of only specific
   behaviors (e.g.  End.DT2M) and therefore the argument length MUST be
   set to 0 for SIDs where the argument is not applicable.

4.  Encoding SRv6 SID information

   The SRv6 Service SID(s) for a BGP Service Prefix are carried in the
   SRv6 Services TLVs of the BGP Prefix-SID Attribute.

   For certain types of BGP Services like L3VPN where a per-VRF SID
   allocation is used (i.e.  End.DT4 or End.DT6 behaviors), the same SID
   is shared across multiple NLRIs thus providing efficient packing.
   However, for certain other types of BGP Services like EVPN VPWS where
   a per-PW SID allocation is required (i.e.  End.DX2 behavior), each
   NLRI would have its own unique SID there by resulting in inefficient
   packing.

   To achieve efficient packing, this document allows the encoding of
   the SRv6 Service SID either as a whole in the SRv6 Services TLVs or
   the encoding of only the common part of the SRv6 SID (e.g.  Locator)
   in the SRv6 Services TLVs and encoding the variable (e.g.  Function
   and Argument parts) in the existing label fields specific to that
   service encoding.  This later form of encoding is referred to as the

   Transposition Scheme where the SRv6 SID Structure Sub-Sub-TLV
   describes the sizes of the parts of the SRv6 SID and to also indicate
   offset of variable part along with its length in SRv6 SID value.  The
   use of the Transposition Scheme is RECOMMENDED for the specific
   service encodings that allow it as described further in Section 5 and
   Section 6.

   As an example, for the EVPN VPWS service prefix described further in
   Section 6.1.2, the function part of the SRv6 SID is encoded in the
   MPLS Label field of the NLRI and the SID value in the SRv6 Services
   TLV carries only the locator part with the SRv6 SID Structure Sub-
   Sub-TLV.  The SRv6 SID Structure sub-sub-TLV defines the lengths of
   locator block, locator node and function parts (arguments are not
   applicable for the End.DX2 behavior).  Transposition Offset indicates
   the bit position and Transposition Length indicates the number of
   bits that are being taken out of the SID and put into label field.

   In yet another example, for the EVPN Ethernet A-D per ES route
   described further in Section 6.1.1, only the argument of the SID
   needs to be signaled.  This argument part of the SRv6 SID MAY be
   transposed in the ESI Label field of the ESI Label Extended Community
   and the SID value in the SRv6 Services TLV is set to 0 with the SRv6
   SID Structure Sub-Sub-TLV.  The SRv6 SID Structure sub-sub-TLV
   defines the lengths of locator block, locator node, function and
   argument parts.  The offset and length of argument part SID value
   moved to label field is set in transposition offset and length of SID
   structure TLV.  The receiving router is then able to put together the
   entire SRv6 Service SID (e.g.  for the End.DT2M behavior) placing the
   label value received in the ESI Label field of the Ethernet A-D per
   ES route into the correct transposition offset and length in the SRv6
   SID with the End.DT2M behavior received for a EVPN Route Type 3
   value.

5.  BGP based L3 service over SRv6

   BGP egress nodes (egress PEs) advertise a set of reachable prefixes.
   Standard BGP update propagation schemes[RFC4271], which may make use
   of route reflectors [RFC4456], are used to propagate these prefixes.
   BGP ingress nodes (ingress PEs) receive these advertisements and may
   add the prefix to the RIB in an appropriate VRF.

   Egress PEs which supports SRv6 based L3 services advertises overlay
   service prefixes along with a Service SID enclosed in a SRv6 L3
   Service TLV within the BGP Prefix-SID Attribute.  This TLV serves two
   purposes - first, it indicates that the egress PE supports SRv6
   overlay and the BGP ingress PE receiving this route MUST choose to
   perform IPv6 encapsulation and optionally insert an SRH [RFC8754]




Dawra, et al.           Expires January 31, 2021               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       SRv6 BGP based Overlay Services           July 2020


   when required; second ,it indicates the value of the Service SID to
   be used in the encapsulation.

   The Service SID thus signaled only has local significance at the
   egress PE, where it may be allocated or configured on a per-CE or
   per-VRF basis.  In practice, the SID may encode a cross-connect to a
   specific Address Family table (END.DT) or next-hop/interface (END.DX)
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming].

   The SRv6 Service SID SHOULD be routable within the AS of the egress
   PE and serves the dual purpose of providing reachability between
   ingress PE and egress PE while also encoding the endpoint behavior.

   When the egress PE sets the next-hop to a value that is not covered
   by the SRv6 Locator from which the SRv6 Service SID is allocated,
   then the ingress PE SHOULD perform reachability check for the SRv6
   Service SID in addition to the BGP next-hop reachability procedures.

   At an ingress PE, BGP installs the received prefix in the correct RIB
   table, recursing via an SR Policy leveraging the received SRv6
   Service SID.

   Assuming best-effort connectivity to the egress PE, the ingress PE
   encapsulates the payload in an outer IPv6 header where the
   destination address is the SRv6 Service SID associated with the
   related BGP route update.

   However, when the received route is colored with an extended color
   community 'C' and Next-Hop 'N', and the ingress PE has a valid SRv6
   Policy (C, N) associated with SID list <S1,S2, S3>
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], then the effective SR
   Policy is <S1, S2, S3-Service-SID>.

   Multiple VPN routes MAY resolve recursively via the same SR Policy.

5.1.  IPv4 VPN Over SRv6 Core

   The MP_REACH_NLRI for SRv6 core is encoded according to IPv4 VPN Over
   IPv6 Core defined in [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc5549revision].

   Label field of IPv4-VPN NLRI is encoded as specified in [RFC8277]
   with the Label Value set to the Function part of the SRv6 SID when
   the Transposition Scheme of encoding (Section 4) is used and
   otherwise set to Implicit NULL.

   SRv6 Service SID is encoded as part of the SRv6 L3 Service TLV.  The
   behavior of the SRv6 SID is entirely up to the originator of the
   advertisement.  In practice, the behavior is End.DX4 or End.DT4.

   The MP_REACH_NLRI for SRv6 core is encoded according to IPv6 VPN over
   IPv6 Core is defined in [RFC4659].

   Label field of the IPv6-VPN NLRI is encoded as specified in [RFC8277]
   with the Label Value set to the Function part of the SRv6 SID when
   the Transposition Scheme of encoding (Section 4) is used and

   SRv6 Service SID is encoded as part of the SRv6 L3 Service TLV.  The
   behavior of the SRv6 SID is entirely up to the originator of the

   The MP_REACH_NLRI for SRv6 core is encoded according to IPv4 over

6.  BGP based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) over SRv6

   [RFC7432] provides an extendable method of building an Ethernet VPN
   (EVPN) overlay.  It primarily focuses on MPLS based EVPNs and
   [RFC8365] extends to IP based EVPN overlays.  [RFC7432] defines Route
   Types 1, 2 and 3 which carry prefixes and MPLS Label fields; the
   Label fields have specific use for MPLS encapsulation of EVPN
   traffic.  Route Type 5 carrying MPLS label information (and thus
   encapsulation information) for EVPN is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-prefix-advertisement].  Route Types 6,7 and 8 are
   defined in [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy].

   o  MAC/IP Advertisement Route (Route Type 2)

   o  Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route (Route Type 3)

   o  Selective Multicast Ethernet Tag route (Route Type 6)

   o  IGMP join sync route (Route Type 7)

   o  IGMP leave sync route (Route Type 8)

   To support SRv6 based EVPN overlays, one or more SRv6 Service SIDs
   are advertised with Route Type 1,2,3 and 5.  The SRv6 Service SID(s)
   per Route Type are advertised in SRv6 L3/L2 Service TLVs within the
   BGP Prefix-SID Attribute.  Signaling of SRv6 Service SID(s) serves
   two purposes - first, it indicates that the BGP egress device
   supports SRv6 overlay and the BGP ingress device receiving this route
   MUST perform IPv6 encapsulation and optionally insert an SRH
   [RFC8754] when required; second, it indicates the value of the
   Service SID(s) to be used in the encapsulation.

   The SRv6 Service SID SHOULD be routable within the AS of the egress
   PE and serves the dual purpose of providing reachability between
   ingress PE and egress PE while also encoding the endpoint behavior.

   When the egress PE sets the next-hop to a value that is not covered
   by the SRv6 Locator from which the SRv6 Service SID is allocated,
   then the ingress PE SHOULD perform reachability check for the SRv6
   Service SID in addition to the BGP next-hop reachability procedures.

6.1.  Ethernet Auto-discovery route over SRv6 Core

   Ethernet Auto-Discovery (A-D) routes are Route Type 1 defined in
   [RFC7432] and may be used to achieve split horizon filtering, fast
   convergence and aliasing.  EVPN Route Type 1 is also used in EVPN-
   VPWS as well as in EVPN flexible cross-connect; mainly used to
   advertise point-to-point services ID.

   As a reminder, EVPN Route Type 1 is encoded as follows:

   A Service SID enclosed in a SRv6 L2 Service TLV within the BGP
   Prefix-SID attribute is advertised along with the A-D route.  The

   used, the Service SID is used to signal Arg.FE2 SID argument for
   applicable End.DT2M SIDs.  When local-bias approach is used, the
   Service SID MAY be of value 0.

   o  When ESI-based filtering is used for Multi-Homing or E-Tree
      procedures, the ESI Filtering argument (Arg.FE2) of the Service
      SID carried along with EVPN Route Type 1 route SHOULD be merged

      [RFC7432].  Details of filtering mechanisms for Leaf-originated
      BUM traffic in EVPN E-Tree services are provided in [RFC8317].

   o  When "local-bias" is used as the Multi-Homing split-horizon
      method, the ESI Filtering argument SHOULD NOT be merged with the
      corresponding End.DT2M SID on the ingress PE.  Details of the
      "local-bias" procedures are described in [RFC8365].

   The setup of multicast trees for use as P-tunnels is outside the
   scope of this document.

6.4.  Ethernet Segment route over SRv6 Core

   As a reminder, an Ethernet Segment route i.e. EVPN Route Type 4 is
   encoded as follows:

                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |  RD (8 octets)                        |
                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |  Ethernet Tag ID (4 octets)           |
                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |  IP Address Length (1 octet)          |
                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |  Originating Router's IP Address      |
                  |          (4 or 16 octets)             |
                  +---------------------------------------+

   o  BGP next-hop: IPv6 address of egress PE

   SRv6 Service TLVs within BGP Prefix-SID attribute are not advertised
   along with this route.  The processing of the route has not changed -
   it remains as described in [RFC7432].

6.5.  IP prefix route over SRv6 Core

   EVPN Route Type 5 is used to advertise IP address reachability
   through MP-BGP to all other PEs in a given EVPN instance.  IP address
   may include host IP prefix or any specific subnet.

   As a reminder, EVPN Route Type 5 is encoded as follows:

                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |  RD (8 octets)                        |
                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |Ethernet Segment Identifier (10 octets)|
                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |  Ethernet Tag ID (4 octets)           |
                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |  IP Prefix Length (1 octet)           |
                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |  IP Prefix (4 or 16 octets)           |
                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |  GW IP Address (4 or 16 octets)       |
                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |  MPLS Label (3 octets)                |
                  +---------------------------------------+

   o  BGP next-hop: IPv6 address of egress PE

   o  MPLS Label: It carries the Function part of the SRv6 SID when the
      Transposition Scheme of encoding (Section 4) is used and otherwise
      set to Implicit NULL.

   SRv6 Service SID is encoded as part of the SRv6 L3 Service TLV.  The
   function of the SRv6 SID is entirely up to the originator of the
   advertisement.  In practice, the behavior is End.DT4/6 or End.DX4/6.

6.6.  EVPN multicast routes (Route Types 6, 7, 8) over SRv6 core

   These routes do not require the advertisement of SRv6 Service TLVs
   along with them.  Similar to EVPN Route Type 4, the BGP Nexthop is
   equal to the IPv6 address of egress PE.

7.  Implementation Status

   The [I-D.matsushima-spring-srv6-deployment-status] describes the
   current deployment and implementation status of SRv6 which also
   includes the BGP services over SRv6 as specified in this document.

8.  Error Handling

   In case of any errors encountered while processing SRv6 Service TLVs,
   the details of the error SHOULD be logged for further analysis.

   If multiple instances of SRv6 L3 Service TLV is encountered, all but
   the first instance MUST be ignored.

   If multiple instances of SRv6 L2 Service TLV is encountered, all but
   the first instance MUST be ignored.

   An SRv6 Service TLV is considered malformed in the following cases:

   o  the TLV Length is less than 1

   o  the TLV Length is inconsistent with the length of BGP Prefix-SID
      attribute

   o  at least one of the constituent Sub-TLVs is malformed

   An SRv6 Service Sub-TLV is considered malformed in the following
   cases:

   o  the Sub-TLV Length is inconsistent with the length of the
      enclosing SRv6 Service TLV

   An SRv6 SID Information Sub-TLV is considered malformed in the
   following cases:



Dawra, et al.           Expires January 31, 2021               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft       SRv6 BGP based Overlay Services           July 2020


      *  the Sub-TLV Length is less than 21

      *  the Sub-TLV Length is inconsistent with the length of the
         enclosing SRv6 Service TLV

      *  at least one of the constituent Sub-Sub-TLVs is malformed

   An SRv6 Service Data Sub-sub-TLV is considered malformed in the
   following cases:

   o  the Sub-Sub-TLV Length is inconsistent with the length of the
      enclosing SRv6 service Sub-TLV

   Any TLV or Sub-TLV or Sub-Sub-TLV is not considered malformed because
   its Type is unrecognized.

   Any TLV or Sub-TLV or Sub-Sub-TLV is not considered malformed because
   of failing any semantic validation of its Value field.

   SRv6 overlay service requires Service SID for forwarding.  The treat-
   as-withdraw action [RFC7606] MUST be performed when at least one
   malformed SRV6 Service TLV is present in the BGP Prefix-SID
   attribute.

   SRv6 SID value in SRv6 Service Sub-TLV is invalid when SID Structure
   Sub-Sub-TLV transposition length is greater than 24 or addition of
   transposition offset and length is greater than 128.  Path having
   such Prefix-SID Attribute should be ineligible during the selection
   of best path for the corresponding prefix.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  BGP Prefix-SID TLV Types registry

   This document introduces three new TLV Types of the BGP Prefix-SID
   attribute.  IANA has assigned Type values in the registry "BGP
   Prefix-SID TLV Types" as follows:

       Value     Type                    Reference
       --------------------------------------------
       4       Deprecated              <this document>
       5       SRv6 L3 Service TLV     <this document>
       6       SRv6 L2 Service TLV     <this document>

   The value 4 previously corresponded to the SRv6-VPN SID TLV, which
   was specified in previous versions of this document and used by early
   implementations of this specification.  It was deprecated and
   replaced by the SRv6 L3 Service and SRv6 L2 Service TLVs.

Internet-Draft       SRv6 BGP based Overlay Services           July 2020


9.2.  SRv6 Service Sub-TLV Types registry

   IANA is requested to create and maintain a new registry called "SRv6
   Service Sub-TLV Types".  The allocation policy for this registry is:

      0 : Reserved
      1-127 : IETF Review
      128-254 : First Come First Served
      255 : Reserved

   The following Sub-TLV Types are defined in this document:

      Value     Type                            Reference
       ----------------------------------------------------
       1         SRv6 SID Information Sub-TLV    <this document>

9.3.  SRv6 Service Data Sub-Sub-TLV Types registry

   IANA is requested to create and maintain a new registry called "SRv6
   Service Data Sub-Sub-TLV Types".  The allocation policy for this
   registry is:

      0 : Reserved
      1-127 : IETF Review
      128-254 : First Come First Served
      255 : Reserved

   The following Sub-Sub-TLV Types are defined in this document:

      Value     Type                              Reference
       ----------------------------------------------------
       1         SRv6 SID Structure Sub-Sub-TLV    <this document>

10.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies extensions to BGP protocol for signalling of
   services for SRv6.  As such, techniques related to authentication of
   BGP sessions for securing messages between BGP peers as discussed in
   the BGP specification [RFC4271] and in the security analysis for BGP
   [RFC4272] apply.  The discussion of the use of the TCP Authentication
   option to protect BGP sessions is found in [RFC5925], while [RFC6952]
   includes an analysis of BGP keying and authentication issues.

   This document does not introduce new services or BGP NLRI types but
   extends the signaling of existing ones for SRv6.  Therefore, the
   security considerations for the respective BGP services
   [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc5549revision] [RFC4659] [RFC2545] [RFC7432]
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-prefix-advertisement] also apply.

Internet-Draft       SRv6 BGP based Overlay Services           July 2020


   SRv6 operates within a trusted SR domain with filtering of traffic at
   the domain boundaries.  These and other security aspects of SRv6 are
   discussed in the security considerations of [RFC8402] [RFC8754] and
   apply for deployment of BGP services using SRv6.  The SRv6 SIDs used
   for the BGP Services in this document are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] and hence the security
   considerations of that document also apply.  The service flows
   between PE routers using SRv6 SIDs advertised via BGP are expected to
   be limited within the trusted SR domain (e.g. within a single AS or
   between multiple ASes within a single provider network).  Therefore,
   precaution is necessary to ensure that the BGP service information
   (including associated SRv6 SID) advertised via BGP sessions is
   limited to peers within this trusted SR domain.  Security
   consideration section of [RFC8669] discuss mechanisms to prevent
   leaking of BGP Prefix-SID attribute, that carries SRv6 SID, outside
   the SR domain.  In the event that these filtering mechanisms, both in
   the forwarding and control plane, are not implemented properly, it
   may be possible for nodes outside the SR domain to learn the VPN
   Service SIDs and use them to direct traffic into VPN networks from
   outside the SR domain.
