                 A SIP Response Code for Unwanted Calls
                 draft-ietf-sipcore-status-unwanted-04

Abstract

   This document defines the 666 (Unwanted) SIP response code, allowing
   called parties to indicate that the call or message was unwanted.
   SIP entities may use this information to adjust how future calls from
   this calling party are handled for the called party or more broadly.

1.  Introduction

   In many countries, an increasing number of calls are unwanted
   [RFC5039]: they might be fraudulent, illegal telemarketing or the
   receiving party does not want to be disturbed by, say, surveys or
   solicitation by charities.  Carriers and other service providers may
   want to help their subscribers avoid receiving such calls, using a
   variety of global or user-specific filtering algorithms.  One input
   into such algorithms is user feedback.  User feedback may be offered
   through smartphone apps, APIs or within the context of a SIP-
   initiated call.  This document addresses only the last mode, where
   the called party either rejects the SIP [RFC3261] request, typically
   requests using the INVITE or MESSAGE methods, as unwanted or
   terminates the session with a BYE request after answering the call.
   To allow the called party to express that the call was unwanted, this
   document defines the 666 (Unwanted) response code.  The called user
   agent (UAS), based on input from the called party or some UA-internal
   logic, uses this to indicate that this call is unwanted and that
   future attempts are likely to be similarly rejected.  While factors
   such as identity spoofing and call forwarding may make authoritative
   identification of the calling party difficult or impossible, the
   network can use such a rejection -- possibly combined with a pattern
   of rejections by other callees and/or other information -- as input
   to a heuristic algorithm for determining future call treatment.  The
   heuristic processing and possible treatment of persistently unwanted
   calls are outside the scope of this document.

   As in [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis], we use the term "caller identity"
   or "calling party identity" in this document to mean either a
   canonical address-of-record (AoR) SIP URI employed to reach a user
   (such as 'sip:alice@atlanta.example.com'), or a telephone number,

   which commonly appears in either a tel URI [RFC3966] or as the user
   portion of a SIP URI.

2.  Normative Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3.  Motivation

   None of the existing 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response codes signify that this
   SIP request is unwanted by the called party.  For example, 603
   (Decline) might be used if the called party is currently at dinner or
   in a meeting, but does not want to indicate any specific reason.  As
   described in Section 21.6.2 [RFC3261], a 603 response may include a
   Retry-After header field to indicate a better time to attempt the
   call.  Thus, the call is rejected due to the called party's
   (temporary) disposition.  As described in Section 4, the called party
   invokes the "unwanted call" user interface and 666 (Unwanted)
   response indicating that it is instead the caller's identity that is
   causing the call to be rejected.  The particular response code number
   was chosen to reflect the distaste felt by many upon receiving such
   calls.

4.  Behavior of SIP Entities

   The response code 666 MAY be used in a failure response for an
   INVITE, MESSAGE, SUBSCRIBE or other out-of-dialog SIP request to
   indicate that the offered communication is unwanted.  The response
   code MAY also be used as the value of the "cause" parameter of a SIP
   reason-value in a Reason header field [RFC3326], typically when the
   UAS issues a BYE request terminating an incoming call or the UAC
   issues a CANCEL request when forking a call.  (Including a Reason
   header field with the 666 status code allows the UAS that receives a
   CANCEL request to make an informed choice whether and how to include
   such calls in their missed-call list.)

   The SIP entities receiving this response code are not obligated to
   take any particular action beyond those appropriate for 6xx
   responses.  Following the default handling for 6xx responses in
   [RFC5057], the 666 response destroys the transaction.  The service
   provider delivering calls or messages to the user issuing the
   response, for example, MAY add the calling party to a personal
   blacklist specific to the called party, MAY use the information as
   input when computing the likelihood that the calling party is placing

   unwanted calls ("crowd sourcing"), MAY initiate a traceback request,
   and MAY report the calling party identity to government authorities.

   This specification does not mandate any particular action by SIP
   entities and leaves those to implementations.  Call handling for
   unwanted calls is likely to involve a combination of heuristics,
   analytics, machine learning, based on user feedback, call
   characteristics such as call duration and call volumes, as well
   changes in such metrics.  Implementations will have to make
   appropriate trade-offs between falsely labeling a caller as unwanted
   and delivering unwanted calls.  The user experience is envisioned to
   be somewhat similar to email spam buttons where the detailed actions
   of the email provider remain opaque to the user.

   Systems receiving 666 responses could decide to treat pre-call and
   mid-call responses differently, given that the called party has had
   access to call content for mid-call rejections.  In other words,
   depending on the implementation, the response code does not
   necessarily automatically block all calls from that caller identity.
   The same user interface action might also trigger addition of the
   caller identity to a local, on-device blacklist or graylist, e.g.,
   causing such calls to be flagged or alerted with a different ring
   tone.

   The actions described here do not depend on the nature of the SIP
   URI, e.g., whether it describes a telephone number or not; however,
   the same anonymous SIP URI [RFC3323] may be used by multiple callers
   and thus such URIs are unlikely to be appropriate for URI-specific
   call treatment.  SIP entities tallying responses for particular
   callers may need to consider canonicalzing SIP URIs, including
   telephone numbers, as described in [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis].  The
   calling party may be identified in different locations in the SIP
   header, e.g., the From header field, P-Asserted-Identity or History-
   Info, and may also be affected by diverting services.

   This document defines a SIP feature-capability [RFC6809], sip.666,
   that allows the registrar to indicate that the corresponding proxy
   supports this particular response code.  This allows the UA, for
   example, to provide a suitable user interface element, such as a
   "spam" button, only if its service provider actually supports the
   feature.  The presence of the feature capability does not imply that
   the provider will take any particular action, such as blocking future
   calls.  A UA may still decide to render a "spam" button even without
   such a capability if, for example, it maintains a device-local
   blacklist or reports unwanted calls to a third party.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  SIP Response Code

   This document registers a new SIP response code.  This response code
   is defined by the following information, which is to be added to the
   "Response Codes" sub-registry under http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   sip-parameters.

   Response Code Number  666

   Default Reason Phrase  Unwanted

   Reference  [this RFC]

5.2.  SIP Global Feature-Capability Indicator

   This document defines the feature capability sip.666 in the "SIP
   Feature-Capability Indicator Registration Tree" registry defined in
   [RFC6809].

   Name  sip.666

   Description  This feature-capability indicator when used in a
      REGISTER response indicates that the server will process the 666
      response code.  This does not imply any specific action.

   Reference  [this RFC]

6.  Security Considerations

   If the calling party address is spoofed, users may report the caller
   identity as placing unwanted calls, possibly leading to the blocking
   of calls from the legitimate user of the caller identity in addition
   to the unwanted caller, i.e., creating a form of denial-of-service
   attack.  Thus, the response code SHOULD NOT be used for creating
   global call filters unless the calling party identity has been
   authenticated using [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis] as being assigned to
   the caller placing the unwanted call.  (The creation of call filters
   local to a user agent is beyond the scope of this document.)

   Even if the identity is not spoofed, a call or message recipient
   might flag legitimate caller identities, e.g., to extract vengeance
   on a person or business, or simply by mistake.  To correct errors,
   any additions to a personal list of blocked caller identities should
   be observable and reversible by the party being protected by the
   blacklist.  For example, the list may be shown on a web page or the
   subscriber may be notified by periodic email reminders.  Any

   additions to a global or carrier-wide list of unwanted callers needs
   to consider that any user-initiated mechanism will suffer from an
   unavoidable rate of false positives and tailor their algorithms
   accordingly, e.g., by comparing the fraction of delivered calls for a
   particular caller that are flagged as unwanted rather than just the
   absolute number, and considering time-weighted filters that give more
   credence to recent feedback.

   Since caller identities are routinely re-assigned to new subscribers,
   algorithms are advised to consider whether the caller identity has
   been re-assigned to a new subscriber and possibly reset any related
   rating.

   Some call services such as 3PCC [RFC3725] and call transfer increase
   the complexity of identifying who (if anyone) should be impacted by
   the receipt of 666 within BYE.  Such services might cause the wrong
   party to be flagged or prevent flagging the desired party.

   For both individually-authenticated and unauthenticated calls,
   recipients of response code 666 may want to distinguish responses
   sent before and after the call has been answered, ascertaining
   whether either response timing suffers from a lower false-positive
   rate.
