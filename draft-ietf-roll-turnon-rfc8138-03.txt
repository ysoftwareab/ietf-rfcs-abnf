1.  Introduction

   The transition to [RFC8138] in a network can only be done when all
   nodes support the specification.  In a mixed case with both
   RFC8138-capable and non-capable nodes, the compression should be
   turned off.

   This document complements RFC 8138 and dedicates a bit in the RPL
   configuration option to indicate whether RFC 8138 compression should
   be used within the RPL Instance.  When the bit is not set, source
   nodes that support RFC 8138 should refrain from using the compression
   unless the information is superseded by configuration.

2.  BCP 14

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Updating RFC 6550

   RPL defines a configuration option that is registered to IANA in
   section 20.14. of [RFC6550].  This specification defines a new flag
   "Enable RFC8138 Compression" (T) that is encoded in one of the
   reserved control bits in the option.  The new flag is set to turn on
   the use of the compression of RPL artifacts with RFC 8138.  The bit
   position of the "T" flag is indicated in Section 6.

Internet-Draft              Enabling RFC 8138               January 2020


   Section 6.3.1.  of [RFC6550] defines a 3-bit Mode of Operation (MOP)
   in the DIO Base Object.  The new "T" flag is defined only for MOP
   value between 0 to 6.  For a MOP value of 7 or above, the flag MAY
   indicate something different and MUST NOT be interpreted as "Enable
   RFC8138 Compression" unless the specification of the MOP indicates to
   do so.

4.  Updating RFC 8138

   This document specifies controls that enable and disable the use of
   the [RFC8138] compression in a RPL Instance.  Arguably, this could
   have been done in [RFC8138] itself.

   A node that supports this specification SHOULD source packets in the
   compressed form using [RFC8138] if the new "T" flag is set in the RPL
   configuration option from its parents.  Failure to do so will result
   in larger packets, yields higher risks of loss and may cause a
   fragmentation.

   A node that supports this specification SHOULD refrain from sourcing
   packets in the compressed form using [RFC8138] if the "T" flag is
   reset.  This behaviour can be overridden by a configuration of the
   node in order to cope with intermediate implementations of the root
   that support [RFC8138] but not this specification and cannot set the
   "T" flag.

   The decision of using RFC 8138 to compress a packet is made at the
   source depending on its capabilities and its knowledge of the state
   of the "T" flag.  A router MUST forward the packet in the form that
   the source used, either compressed or uncompressed.  A router that
   encapsulates a packet is the source of the resulting packet and the
   rules above apply to it in that case.

5.  Transition Scenarios

   A node that supports [RFC8138] but not this specification can only be
   used in a homogeneous network and an upgrade requires a "flag day"
   where all nodes are updated and then the network is rebooted with
   implicitly RFC 8138 compression turned on with the "T" flag set on.

   A node that supports this specification can work in a network with
   RFC 8138 compression turned on or off with the "T" flag set
   accordingly and in a network in transition from off to on or on to
   off (see Section 5.1).

   A node that does not support [RFC8138] can interoperate with a node
   that supports this specification in a network with RFC 8138
   compression turned off.  But it cannot forward compressed packets and



Thubert & Zhao            Expires 25 July 2020                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              Enabling RFC 8138               January 2020


   therefore it cannot act as a router in a network with RFC 8138
   compression turned on.  It may remain connected to that network as a
   leaf and generate uncompressed packets.  The leaf can receive packets
   if they are delivered by the parent 6LR in the uncompressed form.
   This requires a knowledge by the 6LR that the leaf does not support
   RFC 8138.  A RPL-Unaware-Leaf (RUL) [USEofRPLinfo] is an external
   target and by default is not expected to support RFC 8138.

   [RFC6550] states that "Nodes other than the DODAG root MUST NOT
   modify this information when propagating the DODAG Configuration
   option".  In other words, the configuration option is a way for the
   root to configure the LLN nodes but it cannot be used by a parent to
   advertise its capabilities down the DODAG.  A parent propagates the
   "T" flag as set whether it supports RFC 8138 or not.  The setting of
   the "T" flag can thus not be used as an indication of the support by
   the sender, and a child cannot favor a parent based on it.

   Sections 8.5 and 9.2 of [RFC6550] also suggests that a RPL-aware node
   may attach to a DODAG as a leaf node only, e.g., when a node does not
   support the Mode of Operation of a RPL Instance, the Objective
   Function (OF) as indicated by the Objective Code Point (OCP) or some
   other parameters in the configuration option.  [USEofRPLinfo]
   indicates that the node may also join as a RUL, in which case it
   refrains from participating to RPL and depends on the 6LR to ensure
   connectivity regardless on the way the RPL network is operated.

   This means that changing the OCP in a DODAG can be used to force
   nodes that do not support a particular feature to join as leaf only.
   This specification reiterates that a node that is configured to
   operate in a RPL Instance but does not support a value for a known
   parameter that is mandatory for routing MUST NOT operate as a router
   but MAY still join as a leaf.  Note that a legacy node will not
   recognize when a reserved field is now used and will not turn to a
   leaf when that happens.

   The intent for this specification is to perform a migration once and
   for all without the need for a flag day.  In particular it is not the
   intention to undo the setting of the "T" flag, and though it is
   possible to roll back (see Section 5.4), adding nodes that do not
   support [RFC8138] after a roll back may be problematic if the roll
   back is not fully complete (see caveats in Section 5.2).

Internet-Draft              Enabling RFC 8138               January 2020


5.1.  Inconsistent State While Migrating

   When the "T" flag is turned on in the configuration option by the
   root, the information slowly percolates through the DODAG as the DIO
   gets propagated.  Some nodes will see the flag and start sourcing
   packets in the compressed form while other nodes in the same RPL
   Instance are still not aware of it.  Conversely, in non-storing mode,
   the root will start using RFC 8138 with a SRH-6LoRH that routes all
   the way to the last router or possibly to the leaf, if the leaf
   supports RFC 8138.

   This is why it is required that all the routers in the RPL Instance
   support [RFC8138] at the time of the switch, and all nodes that do
   not support [RFC8138] only operate as leaves.

   Setting the "T" flag is ultimately the responsibility of the network
   administrator.  In a case of upgrading a network to turn the
   compression on, the network SHOULD be operated with the "T" flag
   reset until all targeted nodes are upgraded to support this
   specification.  Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 provide possible
   transition scenarios where this can be enforced.

5.2.  Single RPL Instance Scenario

   In a Single RPL Instance Scenario, nodes that support RFC 8138 are
   configured with a new OCP, that may use the same OF operation or a
   variation of it.  The root sets the "T" flag at the time it migrates
   to the new OCP.  As a result, nodes that do not support RFC 8138 join
   as leaves and do not forward packets anymore.  The leaves generate
   packets without compression.  The parents - which supports RFC 8138 -
   may encapsulate the packets using RFC 8138 if needed.  The other way
   around, the root encapsulates packets to the leaves all the way to
   the parent, which decapsulates and distribute the uncompressed inner
   packet to the leaf.

   This scenario presents a number of caveats:

   *  The method consumes an extra OCP.  It also requires a means to
      signal the capabilities of the leaf, e.g., using "RPL Mode of
      Operation extension" [MOP-EXT].

   *  If an implementation does not move to a leaf mode when the OCP is
      changed to an unknown one, then the node may be stalled.

   *  If the only possible parents of a node are nodes that do not
      support RFC 8138, then that node will loose all its parent at the
      time of the migration and it will be stalled until a parent is
      deployed with the new capability.

Internet-Draft              Enabling RFC 8138               January 2020


   *  Nodes that only support RFC8138 for forwarding may not parse the
      RPI in native form.  If such nodes are present, the parent needs
      to encapsulate with RFC8138.


5.3.  Double RPL Instances Scenario

   An alternate to the Single RPL Instance Scenario is to deploy an
   additional RPL Instance for the nodes that support [RFC8138].  The
   two RPL Instances operate independently as specified in [RFC6550].
   The preexisting RPL Instance that does not use [RFC8138], whereas the
   new RPL Instance does.  This is signaled by the "T" flag which is
   only set in the configuration option in DIO messages in the new RPL
   Instance.

   Nodes that support RFC 8138 participate to both Instances but favor
   the new RPL Instance for the traffic that they source.  On the other
   hand, nodes that only support the uncompressed format would either
   not be configured for the new RPL Instance, or would be configured to
   join it as leaves only.

   This method eliminates the risks of nodes being stalled that are
   described in Section 5.2 but requires implementations to support at
   least two RPL Instances and demands management capabilities to
   introduce new RPL Instances and deprecate old ones.

5.4.  Rolling Back

   After downgrading a network to turn the [RFC8138] compression off,
   the administrator SHOULD make sure that all nodes have converged to
   the "T" flag reset before allowing nodes that do not support the
   compression in the network (see caveats in Section 5.2).

   It is RECOMMENDED to only deploy nodes that support [RFC8138] in a
   network where the compression is turned on.  A node that does not
   support [RFC8138] MUST only be used as a leaf.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification updates the Registry for the "DODAG Configuration
   Option Flags" that was created for [RFC6550] as follows:

       +------------+---------------------------------+-----------+

7.  Security Considerations

   Turning the "T" flag on before some routers are upgraded may cause a
   loss of packets.  The new bit is protected as the rest of the
   configuration so this is just one of the many attacks that can happen
   if an attacker manages to inject a corrupted configuration.

   Turning the "T" flag on and off may create inconsistencies in the
   network but as long as all nodes are upgraded to RFC 8138 support
   they will be able to forward both forms.  The draft insists that the
   source is responsible for selecting whether the packet is compressed
   or not, and all routers must use the format that the source selected.
   So the result of an inconsistency is merely that both forms will be
   present in the network, at an additional cost of bandwidth for
   packets in the uncompressed form.
