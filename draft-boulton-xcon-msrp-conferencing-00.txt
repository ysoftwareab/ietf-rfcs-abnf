1.  Introduction

   A Centralized Conference as defined by the XCON working group is both
   signaling and protocol agnostic.  The primary focus of the XCON work
   has been centered on the Session Initiation Protocol for signaling
   and Audio/Video for the media types.  The requirements to support
   conferences of session-based instant messages, private messaging, and
   sidebars are introduced in [6].  This document defines the mechanisms
   and associated framework elements involved when using the Message
   Session Relay Protocol(MSRP) in a Centralized Conference(XCON) in
   support of those requirements.

   [Editors Note: This document is still in early stages of development
   and is intended to invoke discussion.  It is not intended to provide
   exact solutions at his stage, but rather explores a potential
   approach to a solution.]

   This document has been constructed in full compliance with both the
   XCON Framework[2] document and the SIPPING Conference Framework [3]
   document.  The XCON Framework provides the data model and interfaces
   to be used while the SIPPING Framework provides details of the SIP
   signaling protocol operations.  For the purpose of this document,
   MSRP will be discussed in the context of SIP being the carrying
   protocol, as defined in the core MSRP [4] specification.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

3.  Overview of Operation

   MSRP is defined as a peer-to-peer protocol that enables a direct
   connection between two compliant endpoints, unless an MSRP relay is
   inserted in the MSRP signaling path.  The MSRP Relay specification
   [5] details the associated functionality with a relay in the
   signaling path.  Centralized conferencing using MSRP can be achieved
   by the Conference Server appearing as an MSRP endpoint for Conference
   Participants.

   Figure 1 provides an illustration of MSRP clients having a direct,
   1:1 connection to the Conference server.  This type of functionality
   can be roughly categorized as a hybrid MSRP entity that combines both
   MSRP client and MSRP relay functionality.  An MSRP SEND sent to the
   conference will arrive at the conference server and then be

                        Figure 1: Client Connection

   As mentioned previously, an MSRP client connecting to a Conference
   server has a 1:1 relationship with the MSRP signaling entity, each
   having a unique MSRP session ID (session ID's are contained in MSRP
   URLs).  When referring to MSRP session ID's the document is making
   reference to the locally (at Conference Server) generated Session ID
   that is inserted into the local Path SDP attribute and used for MSRP
   session signaling identification.  An important concept in this
   proposal is the creation and management of MSRP sessions.  It is
   important that each MSRP session created, as identified by the unique

   session ID, is explicitly tied to an associated Conference,
   represented by the Conference Identifier.  This provides the relevant
   association between MSRP and a Conference.  An example is illustrated
   in Figure 2.


             -------------------------------------------
             |        XCON Conference Identifier       |
             -------------------------------------------
             |         MSRP Session ID=8asjdhk         |
             |         MSRP Session ID=38iuhds         |
             |         MSRP Session ID=djiowid         |
             |         MSRP Session ID=389hewu         |
             -------------------------------------------


                       Figure 2: Session Association

   On issuing an MSRP request to any of the MSRP sessions that are
   members of a Conference, the message will be replicated to all other
   MSRP Sessions that are participants of the Conference.

   An MSRP capable client wishing to join a conference uses standardized
   XCON mechanisms for creating and joining a Conference.  SIP signaling
   mechanisms for creating and joining a conference are defined in
   SIPPING Conference Framework [3] and non signaling specific
   mechanisms are defined in the XCON Framework [2].

   Each conference created in accordance with the XCON data model (as
   defined in the XCON framework) has a unique internal representation
   in the form of a Conference Data object.  This representation
   provides a unique external key for use in various conference
   operations (e.g.  Identify a specific conference  for use by the Data
   Manipulation Protocol [ref]).  This document will use the unique
   Conference Object identifier, in association with a unique user
   identifier, as a means to identify an MSRP session in association
   with a conference represented by the Conference Identifier.

   [Editors Note: The following is based on current discussion in the
   XCON framework and would align appropriately]

   This can be achieved as follows:
   o  Various mechanisms are used to create a conference within an XCON
      compliant Conference server.  These include using the Data
      Manipulation Protocol and SIP signaling to generate a unique
      conference identifier from the Conference Factory.  The XCON
      Conference Identifier might look something like:- xcon:conf=1234.

   o  It is proposed that the Conference system and MSRP signaling
      interface use the Conference Identifier when creating MSRP
      sessions for conference participants.  As part of the SIP offer/
      answer exchange between the Focus and an MSRP client when adding
      an MSRP clients to a conference, the focus must create appropriate
      SDP that complies with section 8.1 of [4].
   o  As part of the SDP construction for the offer/answer the
      Conference Focus has to provide an 'msrp:' URL, as defined in
      section 6 of [4].  It is proposed that the contents of this URL is
      the primary identifier for the associated conference instance.
      The unique identifier for an MSRP session is currently located
      within the SDP 'a=path' attribute, as shown by the string '2s93i9'
      in Figure 3.  This session Identifier is created by an MSRP client
      for identification purposes and so adding semantics only impacts
      the creating entity.

       a=path:msrp://alice.example.com:7394/2s93i9;tcp

                          Figure 3: Example MSRP URL

   o  A conference server will use the semantics defined for the session
      identifier in an 'msrp' URL to identify both a specific conference
      and a participating user.  The Focus MUST ensure that the
      uniqueness of the whole MSRP URL is maintained for compliance to
      the core MSRP specification .  An example of how this could be
      achieved is defined in Figure 4.

       a=path:msrp://alice.example.com:7394/Conf=123456~userID=654321~;tcp

                          Figure 4: Example MSRP URL

   o  In this example the session identifier contains the following
      string 'Conf=123456~userID=654321~'.  This string can be broken
      down to several into pieces of conference specific information.
      The first part of the string contains the Conference Identifier
      for which this message is intended.  An MSRP conference entity
      receiving an MSRP SEND request would search for the string 'Conf='
      and extract the identifier from the '=' sign to the '~' character.
      The MSRP conference entity can then compare with existing
      conference instances to see if there is a match.  Using semantics
      in the session identifier allows the reuse of connections to the
      conference system.
   o  After extracting the conference identifier from the MSRP URL, the
      MSRP entity can then extract the unique user identifier.  After
      the first '~' sign, a unique user identifier can be found of the
      form userID=654321~ from Figure 4.  This allows the controlling
      MSRP entity to internally identify the user issuing the SEND
      request and then send the request to all other participants in the

Internet-Draft              MSRP Conferencing                  June 2005


      conference instance.
   o  Using this mechanism does not make any additional requirements on
      MSRP clients.  The information contained in the MSRP URL is just
      viewed as a random session identifier.

4.  Text Sidebar

   The Session Based Messaging Conferencing requirements document [6]
   identifies the requirement (REQ-GEN-12) to set up a sidebar
   conference with one or more participants of the conference.

   The concept of a 'sidebar' in an XCON compliant conference system is
   fully described in section 7.3 of the XCON Framework document [2].
   The creation, manipulation and deletion of sidebars for MSRP based
   sessions has the same principles.

   [Editors note: see current sidebar proposal in the XCON FW relating
   to cloning a conference object with no associated time reference.
   This provides a current sub-conference.]

   Creating a sidebar representation for MSRP would have internal
   ramifications in a Conference System.  It would involve the creation
   of a cloned conference object (see editor's note above) that
   associates the appropriate Conference users.  This would then involve
   a new session being established to convey the Sidebar information.
   The session would be created in the same manner as described in
   Section 3 with a new 'conf=' parameter in the 'msrp' session ID but
   the consistent 'userID'.  This would again create unique session
   identifiers that can be associated with the sidebar instance.  The
   Conference system would also manage the mapping between the sidebar
   and the main conference.

   [Editors note: Lots more detail to insert.]

5.  Private Message

   The Session Based Messaging Conferencing Requirements document [6]
   identifies a set of requirements to support the ability to send a
   private message to another participant in a conference.  This message
   would not be seen by any other conference participants.

   The mechanism for achieving this follows on from the semantics
   contained in the construction of the identifying 'a=path' attribute,
   as described in Section 3.  This example used the 'conf=' and
   'userID=' identifiers in the session identifier of the 'msrp' URL.
   It is proposed that if a user wishes to send a private message to
   another user in a conference  it extends the use of such identifiers.
   This can be achieved using an optional 'priv=' identifier.  If this



Boulton & Barnes        Expires December 19, 2005               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              MSRP Conferencing                  June 2005


   identifier exists within a conference, then the SEND message is only
   distributed to the one location contained in the 'priv=' identifier.
   If the identifier does not exist within a Conference, the SEND
   message SHOULD NOT be distributed to the Conference members and
   should be rejected with an appropriate error response.

   An example of an 'msrp' URL containing the 'priv=' identifier is
   contained in Figure 5

   a=path:msrp://alice.example.com:7394/Conf=123456~userID=654321~priv=abcdef~;tcp

                Figure 5: Example MSRP Private Message URL

   [Editors note: Need to explain how a conference client obtains
   individual participant identifiers.  The initial inclination is to
   propose  the conference package rather than define a new Event
   package, but this is also a more general question relating to the
   XCON FW, as well (i.e. we need to complete and agree  the work on
   identifiers there to better understand the general approach).]

   This section describes a mechanism to send a private message to one
   other participant in a conference.  If there is a desire to involve
   more than one other participant in the private messaging,  then a
   sidebar would be used.
