INTERNET-DRAFT           IP over Burrito Carriers            April 2005 

Abstract

   IP over Burrito Carriers describes an experimental method for the 
   creation of edible data packets. This standard is intended to be 
   implemented in metropolitan area networks due to the preexisting
   burrito delivery infrastructure. While currently only flour tortillas
   have been found acceptable for encapsulating the data contained in 
   the packet, tests are underway to determine the viability of using 
   corn tortillas. One must be wary of disreputable IP over Burrito 
   service providers as packet corruption and bad data handling can 
   result in damage to the receiving unit and may result in an extremely
   messy packet rejection. Conveniently, there is a rating system 
   already in place. While the rating by the health department doesn't 
   ensure proper data encapsulation, it does allow the end user to 
   determine if the service provider's quality to cost ratio is 
   adequate. This is an experimental standard, not a recommended 
   standard.


Introduction
   
   In today's wireless hotspot, WAP enabled, WiFi zoned world of dining
   there exists a discrimination against diners who prefer to eat 
   outside the established confines of the restaurant. The IP over 
   Burrito standard was developed to create an edible solution to the
   growing rift in the availability of free internet access between 
   sit-down and delivery/carry out diners. While considerable research
   has yet to be performed on the IP over Burrito standard, multiple 
   simulations in a controlled environment have proven to be both 
   successful and filling. Some concerns that must be addressed 
   in the future include the ability of the hosts buffer to 
   accommodate a large number of packets while they are processed. Also 
   the fact that a buffer overflow would cause a catastrophic system 
   failure resulting in a purging of all previously processed datagrams
   is of major concern. Currently datagrams are encapsulated in a flour 
   tortilla. Future projects will determine the viability of using corn
   tortillas but for now the standard requires the use of a flour 
   tortilla for all datagram encapsulation.

Packet Format

   Packets will follow the standard Internet Header Format [RFC-791] 
   (Figure 1). Each field (Figure 1) has been sublimated with a tangible 
   equivalent (Figure 2) to binary representation that is both tasty and 
   filling.

INTERNET-DRAFT           IP over Burrito Carriers            April 2005

  Version:  Obvious

    The Version field is indicated by the obvious. It is a burrito. 
    As the IP over Burrito standard is designed to work solely 
    with modern equipment, it supports only IPv4 packets.


  IHL:  Onion

    Internet Header Length is specified by the number of onions placed 
    in the burrito.

  Type of Service:  Jalapenos

    The 8 bits of this header are specified by 8 jalapeno slices. A
    half slice indicates a zero and a whole slice indicates a one.


  Total Length:  Physical Burrito Length

    The length of the burrito in centimeters multiplied by 4096 gives
    the total length of the datagram, in octets.


  Identification:  Number written on foil wrapper.


  Flags:  Type of Beans

    Black Beans = Don't Fragment
    Red Beans = Fragment
    Pinto Beans = Last Fragment
    Kidney Beans = More Fragments
 

  Fragment Offset: Total Number of Beans.


  Time to Live: Specified by source host in minutes. 

    Commonly in the range of 35-45 minutes, given traffic conditions.


  Protocol:  Guacamole

    The chunkiness, quality, and amount of Guacamole determine this 
    data.

INTERNET-DRAFT           IP over Burrito Carriers            April 2005

  Header Checksum:  Receipt

    The data on the receipt should match the specifications of the 
    burrito datagram.


  Source Address:  Lettuce

    Given the size of this field it is necessary to break it down
    into subsections. The lettuce is placed in 4 discrete groups. 
    Also, the lettuce is colored with food coloring to be either 
    red, green, or blue. Red lettuce indicates the most significant
    digit, green the middle digit, and blue the least significant 
    digit. Thus limiting the amount of lettuce on the burrito to a
    manageable level in respect to determining the data and fitting
    in the tortilla.


  Destination Address:  Rice

    Given the size of this field it is necessary to break it down
    into subsections. The rice is placed in 4 discrete groups. 
    Also, the rice is colored with food coloring to be either 
    red, green, or blue. Red rice indicates the most significant
    digit, green the middle digit, and blue the least significant 
    digit. Thus limiting the amount of rice on the burrito to a
    manageable level in respect to determining the data and fitting
    in the tortilla.


  Data: Beef

    The data will be transmitted in a beef representation of 
    hexadecimal. Each beef cluster will be counted as a decimal 
    representation of a hexadecimal digit. Each beef field will be 
    separated by a slice of chicken. There will be a maximum of 15 
    chunks of beef and a minimum of 0 chunks of beef per unit chicken. 
    Approximately 16 bytes of data can be stored per burrito packet.
  

Packet Routing

   Should a node become damaged or congested (i.e. traffic jam, 
   construction, etc) and be unable to accommodate Burrito encapsulated
   packets in a timely fashion then the packet will be routed by the 
   delivery boy around any obstructions in an attempt to make a 
   delivery inside of the packets given TTL.

Security Considerations

   The IP over Burrito service can be considered secure for almost any 
   non-tactical use. Before transmission, the data contents of the 
   packet are sterilized, killing most viruses that might be transmitted
   via the packet. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the packet, this
   uninfected state is only temporary. Unlike the current IP 
   transmission standard, packets created by the IP over Burrito Carrier
   service are vulnerable to infection during transmission. Infected
   packets will usually be detected two to four hours after the packet 
   is destroyed.

   As every packet is encapsulated in an opaque wrapper, the data inside
   the packet is impossible to access via standard packet sniffing 
   procedures. Attempts to breach the encapsulation of the package in
   transit will likely cause permanent damage to the encapsulation, 
   thereby signaling to the original recipients of the packet that data 
   interception was attempted. Re-encapsulation of the original data is 
   impossible, as the packet data is tightly integrated with the 
   encapsulation. Due to the long delay between packet transmission and
   packet reception, however, there is sufficient time for a third party
   to duplicate the packet data and forward it to the original 
   recipient. The detection of this interception is likely only if the 
   recipient should follow the standard packet disposal process and be 
   well acquainted with the peculiarities of packets created by a given
   server.
   
   Packet transportation uses a highly advanced algorithm to prevent
   damage to the packet and to prevent its reception by third parties. 
   As the packet transportation system is highly vulnerable to social
   engineering, however, the use of encryption is recommended for the
   transmission of any secure data.

   Although the packets decay naturally over time, the slow rate of 
   natural packet decay will likely make user-induced destruction
   mandatory to prevent third parties from examining the packet data
   after the packet has been received. Unfortunately, the packet 
   delivery system works poorly in a tactical environment, as the packet
   can be easily waylaid by hostile forces.

   Due to the extended time that packet creation requires, servers will
   be highly vulnerable to message flooding. and responses will be 
   delayed greatly; however, the likeliness of a IP over Burrito DOS 
   attack can be considered negligible, as the clients are charged for 
   each packet that the server sends to them.

   Of more concern is the extended time that packet processing requires
   on the receiving hosts end. Should a host attempt to process more 
   than 5 packets a in a one hour period a buffer overflow could occur
   and data might be lost, or worse: it could be disseminated in a 
   disorganized and partially processed state all over any nearby 
   objects. This could result in damage to secondary systems and the 
   server storage facility. Unfortunately a buffer overflow on one host
   can cause hosts in the immediate vicinity to suffer similar buffer 
   overflows.
   
   Also a matter of great concern is the ability of viruses to spread
   by IP over Burrito. Should the server or packet itself be infected
   then infection of the host is highly likely. When dealing with an 
   unknown server it is advisable to carefully examine the packet for 
   any sign of damage or infection (i.e. rotten smell, slick covering 
   to the meat, etc).
