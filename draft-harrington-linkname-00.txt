           Link Local Addressing and Name Resolution in IPv6

                    <draft-harrington-linkname.txt>


Abstract

   This draft proposes an experimental mechanism by which IPv6 link-local
   addresses and associated system names may be distributed among
   interconnected hosts, for use by users and applications.  It
   provides an overview of the problem, a proposed solution (including
   suggested protocol details), and lists various related issues.
   This work is introduced to the IPng
   Working Group initially, although it might also have implications or
   concerns relevant to individuals working on directory services and
   other areas.
