             YANG Groupings for TLS Clients and TLS Servers
                draft-ietf-netconf-tls-client-server-22

Abstract

   This document defines three YANG modules: the first defines groupings
   for a generic TLS client, the second defines groupings for a generic
   TLS server, and the third defines common identities and groupings
   used by both the client and the server.  It is intended that these
   groupings will be used by applications using the TLS protocol.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines three YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] modules: the first
   defines a grouping for a generic TLS client, the second defines a
   grouping for a generic TLS server, and the third defines identities
   and groupings common to both the client and the server (TLS is
   defined in [RFC5246]).  It is intended that these groupings will be
   used by applications using the TLS protocol.  For instance, these
   groupings could be used to help define the data model for an HTTPS
   [RFC2818] server or a NETCONF over TLS [RFC7589] based server.

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TLS Clients and Servers      August 2020


   The client and server YANG modules in this document each define one
   grouping, which is focused on just TLS-specific configuration, and
   specifically avoids any transport-level configuration, such as what
   ports to listen-on or connect-to.  This affords applications the
   opportunity to define their own strategy for how the underlying TCP
   connection is established.  For instance, applications supporting
   NETCONF Call Home [RFC8071] could use the "ssh-server-grouping"
   grouping for the TLS parts it provides, while adding data nodes for
   the TCP-level call-home configuration.

1.1.  Relation to other RFCs

   This document presents one or more YANG modules [RFC7950] that are
   part of a collection of RFCs that work together to define
   configuration modules for clients and servers of both the NETCONF
   [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040] protocols.

   The modules have been defined in a modular fashion to enable their
   use by other efforts, some of which are known to be in progress at
   the time of this writing, with many more expected to be defined in
   time.

   The normative dependency relationship between the various RFCs in the
   collection is presented in the below diagram.  The labels in the
   diagram represent the primary purpose provided by each RFC.
   Hyperlinks to each RFC are provided below the diagram.

1.2.  Specification Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Adherence to the NMDA

   This document in compliant with the Network Management Datastore
   Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  For instance, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore],
   trust anchors and keys installed during manufacturing are expected to
   appear in <operational>.

2.  The "ietf-tls-common" Module

   The TLS common model presented in this section contains identities
   and groupings common to both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The
   "hello-params-grouping" grouping can be used to configure the list of
   TLS algorithms permitted by the TLS client or TLS server.  The lists
   of algorithms are ordered such that, if multiple algorithms are
   permitted by the client, the algorithm that appears first in its list
   that is also permitted by the server is used for the TLS transport
   layer connection.  The ability to restrict the algorithms allowed is
   provided in this grouping for TLS clients and TLS servers that are
   capable of doing so and may serve to make TLS clients and TLS servers
   compliant with local security policies.  This model supports both
   TLS1.2 [RFC5246] and TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].

   TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 have different ways defining their own supported
   cryptographic algorithms, see TLS and DTLS IANA registries page
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-
   parameters.xhtml):

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TLS Clients and Servers      August 2020


   *  TLS 1.2 defines four categories of registries for cryptographic
      algorithms: TLS Cipher Suites, TLS SignatureAlgorithm, TLS
      HashAlgorithm, TLS Supported Groups.  TLS Cipher Suites plays the
      role of combining all of them into one set, as each value of the
      set represents a unique and feasible combination of all the
      cryptographic algorithms, and thus the other three registry
      categories do not need to be considered here.  In this document,
      the TLS common model only chooses those TLS1.2 algorithms in TLS
      Cipher Suites which are marked as recommended:
      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
      TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
      TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, and so on.  All chosen
      algorithms are enumerated in Table 1-1 below;

   *  TLS 1.3 defines its supported algorithms differently.  Firstly, it
      defines three categories of registries for cryptographic
      algorithms: TLS Cipher Suites, TLS SignatureScheme, TLS Supported
      Groups.  Secondly, all three of these categories are useful, since
      they represent different parts of all the supported algorithms
      respectively.  Thus, all of these registries categories are
      considered here.  In this draft, the TLS common model chooses only
      those TLS1.3 algorithms specified in B.4, 4.2.3, 4.2.7 of
      [RFC8446].

   Thus, in order to support both TLS1.2 and TLS1.3, the cipher-suites
   part of the "hello-params-grouping" grouping should include three
   parameters for configuring its permitted TLS algorithms, which are:
   TLS Cipher Suites, TLS SignatureScheme, TLS Supported Groups.  Note
   that TLS1.2 only uses TLS Cipher Suites.

   Features are defined for algorithms that are OPTIONAL or are not
   widely supported by popular implementations.  Note that the list of
   algorithms is not exhaustive.

   Comments:

   *  The diagram shows that there are two base identities.
   *  One base identity is used to specific TLS versions, while the
      other is used to specify cipher-suites.
   *  These base identities are "abstract", in the object orientied
      programming sense, in that they only define a "class" of things,
      rather than a specific thing.

2.1.3.  Groupings

     +-- hello-params-grouping

      |  The diagram above uses syntax that is similar to but not
      |  defined in [RFC8340].

   Each of these groupings are presented in the following subsections.

2.1.3.1.  The "hello-params-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "hello-params-
   grouping" grouping:

     grouping hello-params-grouping
       +-- tls-versions
       |  +-- tls-version*   identityref
       +-- cipher-suites
          +-- cipher-suite*   identityref

   Comments:

   *  This grouping is used by both the "tls-client-grouping" and the
      "tls-server-grouping" groupings defined in Section 3.1.2.1 and
      Section 4.1.2.1, respectively.

   *  This grouping enables client and server configurations to specify
      the TLS versions and cipher suites that are to be used when
      establishing TLS sessions.

   *  The "cipher-suites" list is "ordered-by user".

2.1.4.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-tls-common" module does not contain any protocol-accessible
   nodes, but the module needs to be "implemented", as described in
   Section 5.6.5 of [RFC7950], in order for the identities in
   Section 2.1.2 to be defined.

2.2.  Example Usage

   This section shows how it would appear if the "hello-params-grouping"
   grouping were populated with some data.

   <hello-params
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tls-common"
      xmlns:tlscmn="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tls-common">
     <tls-versions>
       <tls-version>tlscmn:tls-1.1</tls-version>
       <tls-version>tlscmn:tls-1.2</tls-version>
     </tls-versions>
     <cipher-suites>
       <cipher-suite>tlscmn:dhe-rsa-with-aes-128-cbc-sha</cipher-suite>
       <cipher-suite>tlscmn:rsa-with-aes-128-cbc-sha</cipher-suite>
       <cipher-suite>tlscmn:rsa-with-3des-ede-cbc-sha</cipher-suite>
     </cipher-suites>
   </hello-params>

   This section defines a YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] module called "ietf-tls-
   client".  A high-level overview of the module is provided in
   Section 3.1.  Examples illustatrating the module's use are provided
   in Examples (Section 3.2).  The YANG module itself is defined in
   Section 3.3.

3.1.  Data Model Overview

   This section provides an overview of the "ietf-tls-client" module in
   terms of its features and groupings.

3.1.1.  Features

   The following diagram lists all the "feature" statements defined in
   the "ietf-tls-client" module:

   Features:
     +-- tls-client-hello-params-config
     +-- tls-client-keepalives
     +-- x509-certificate-auth
     +-- raw-public-key-auth
     +-- psk-auth

      |  The diagram above uses syntax that is similar to but not
      |  defined in [RFC8340].

3.1.2.  Groupings

   The following diagram lists all the "grouping" statements defined in
   the "ietf-tls-client" module:

      |  The diagram above uses syntax that is similar to but not
      |  defined in [RFC8340].

   Each of these groupings are presented in the following subsections.

3.1.2.1.  The "tls-client-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "tls-client-
   grouping" grouping:

   *  The "client-identity" node, which is optionally configured (as
      client authentication MAY occur at a higher protocol layer),
      configures identity credentials, each enabled by a "feature"
      statement defined in Section 3.1.1.

   *  The "server-authentication" node configures trust anchors for
      authenticating the TLS server, with each option enabled by a
      "feature" statement.

   *  The "hello-params" node , which must be enabled by a feature,
      configures parameters for the TLS sessions established by this
      configuration.

   *  The "keepalives" node, which must be enabled by a feature,
      configures a "presence" container for testing the aliveness of the
      TLS server.  The aliveness-test occurs at the TLS protocol layer.

   *  For the referenced grouping statement(s):

      -  The "local-or-keystore-end-entity-cert-with-key-grouping"
         grouping is discussed in Section 2.1.3.6 of
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-keystore-asymmetric-key-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.4 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-keystore-symmetric-key-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.3 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-truststore-certs-grouping" grouping is discussed
         in Section 2.1.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors].
      -  The "local-or-truststore-public-keys-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.2 of
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors].
      -  The "hello-params-grouping" grouping is discussed in
         Section 2.1.3.1 in this document.

3.1.3.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-tls-client" module does not contain any protocol-accessible
   nodes.

3.2.  Example Usage

   This section presents two examples showing the "tls-client-grouping"
   grouping populated with some data.  These examples are effectively
   the same except the first configures the client identity using a
   local key while the second uses a key configured in a keystore.  Both
   examples are consistent with the examples presented in Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

   Comments:

   *  The "server-identity" node configures identity credentials, each
      of which is enabled by a "feature".

   *  The "client-authentication" node, which is optionally configured
      (as client authentication MAY occur at a higher protocol layer),
      configures trust anchors for authenticating the TLS client, with
      each option enabled by a "feature" statement.

   *  The "hello-params" node, which must be enabled by a feature,
      configures parameters for the TLS sessions established by this
      configuration.

   *  The "keepalives" node, which must be enabled by a feature,
      configures a flag enabling the TLS client to test the aliveness of
      the TLS server, as well as a "presence" container for testing the
      aliveness of the TLSi client.  The aliveness-tests occurs at the
      TLS protocol layer.

   *  For the referenced grouping statement(s):

      -  The "local-or-keystore-end-entity-cert-with-key-grouping"
         grouping is discussed in Section 2.1.3.6 of
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-keystore-asymmetric-key-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.4 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-keystore-symmetric-key-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.3 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-truststore-public-keys-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.2 of
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors].
      -  The "local-or-truststore-certs-grouping" grouping is discussed
         in Section 2.1.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors].
      -  The "hello-params-grouping" grouping is discussed in
         Section 2.1.3.1 in this document.

4.1.3.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-tls-server" module does not contain any protocol-accessible
   nodes.

4.2.  Example Usage

   This section presents two examples showing the "tls-server-grouping"
   grouping populated with some data.  These examples are effectively
   the same except the first configures the server identity using a
   local key while the second uses a key configured in a keystore.  Both
   examples are consistent with the examples presented in Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

   The following configuration example uses local-definitions for the
   server identity and client authentication:

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  The "ietf-tls-common" YANG Module

   The "ietf-tls-common" YANG module defines "grouping" statements that
   are designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols, such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols
   have mandatory-to-implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS)
   with mutual authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the module in this document only define groupings, these
   considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules that
   use these groupings.

   None of the readable data nodes defined in this YANG module are
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.  The NACM
   "default-deny-all" extension has not been set for any data nodes
   defined in this module.

   None of the writable data nodes defined in this YANG module are
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.  The NACM
   "default-deny-write" extension has not been set for any data nodes
   defined in this module.

   This module does not define any RPCs, actions, or notifications, and
   thus the security consideration for such is not provided here.

5.2.  The "ietf-tls-client" YANG Module

   The "ietf-tls-client" YANG module defines "grouping" statements that
   are designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols, such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols
   have mandatory-to-implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS)
   with mutual authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the module in this document only define groupings, these
   considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules that
   use these groupings.

   None of the readable data nodes defined in this YANG module are
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.  The NACM
   "default-deny-all" extension has not been set for any data nodes
   defined in this module.

      |  Please be aware that this module uses the "key" and "private-
      |  key" nodes from the "ietf-crypto-types" module
      |  [I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types], where said nodes have the NACM
      |  extension "default-deny-all" set, thus preventing unrestricted
      |  read-access to the cleartext key values.

   All of the writable data nodes defined by this module may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  For
   instance, any modification to a key or reference to a key may
   dramatically alter the implemented security policy.  For this reason,
   the NACM extension "default-deny-write" has been set for all data
   nodes defined in this module.

5.3.  The "ietf-tls-server" YANG Module

   The "ietf-tls-server" YANG module defines "grouping" statements that
   are designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols, such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols
   have mandatory-to-implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS)
   with mutual authentication.

   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of

   considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules that

   None of the readable data nodes defined in this YANG module are

Appendix A.  Change Log

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

A.1.  00 to 01

   *  Noted that '0.0.0.0' and '::' might have special meanings.

   *  Renamed "keychain" to "keystore".

A.2.  01 to 02

   *  Removed the groupings containing transport-level configuration.
      Now modules contain only the transport-independent groupings.

   *  Filled in previously incomplete 'ietf-tls-client' module.

   *  Added cipher suites for various algorithms into new 'ietf-tls-
      common' module.

A.3.  02 to 03

   *  Added a 'must' statement to container 'server-auth' asserting that
      at least one of the various auth mechanisms must be specified.

   *  Fixed description statement for leaf 'trusted-ca-certs'.

A.4.  03 to 04

   *  Updated title to "YANG Groupings for TLS Clients and TLS Servers"

   *  Updated leafref paths to point to new keystore path

   *  Changed the YANG prefix for ietf-tls-common from 'tlscom' to
      'tlscmn'.

   *  Added TLS protocol verions 1.0 and 1.1.

   *  Made author lists consistent

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TLS Clients and Servers      August 2020


   *  Now tree diagrams reference ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams

   *  Updated YANG to use typedefs around leafrefs to common keystore
      paths

   *  Now inlines key and certificates (no longer a leafref to keystore)

A.5.  04 to 05

   *  Merged changes from co-author.

A.6.  05 to 06

   *  Updated to use trust anchors from trust-anchors draft (was
      keystore draft)

   *  Now Uses new keystore grouping enabling asymmetric key to be
      either locally defined or a reference to the keystore.

A.7.  06 to 07

   *  factored the tls-[client|server]-groupings into more reusable
      groupings.

   *  added if-feature statements for the new "x509-certificates"
      feature defined in draft-ietf-netconf-trust-anchors.

A.8.  07 to 08

   *  Added a number of compatibility matrices to Section 5 (thanks
      Frank!)

   *  Clarified that any configured "cipher-suite" values need to be
      compatible with the configured private key.

A.9.  08 to 09

   *  Updated examples to reflect update to groupings defined in the
      keystore draft.

   *  Add TLS keepalives features and groupings.

   *  Prefixed top-level TLS grouping nodes with 'tls-' and support
      mashups.

   *  Updated copyright date, boilerplate template, affiliation, and
      folding algorithm.

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TLS Clients and Servers      August 2020


A.10.  09 to 10

   *  Reformatted the YANG modules.

A.11.  10 to 11

   *  Collapsed all the inner groupings into the top-level grouping.

   *  Added a top-level "demux container" inside the top-level grouping.

   *  Added NACM statements and updated the Security Considerations
      section.

   *  Added "presence" statements on the "keepalive" containers, as was
      needed to address a validation error that appeared after adding
      the "must" statements into the NETCONF/RESTCONF client/server
      modules.

   *  Updated the boilerplate text in module-level "description"
      statement to match copyeditor convention.

A.12.  11 to 12

   *  In server model, made 'client-authentication' a 'presence' node
      indicating that the server supports client authentication.

   *  In the server model, added a 'required-or-optional' choice to
      'client-authentication' to better support protocols such as
      RESTCONF.

   *  In the server model, added a 'local-or-external' choice to
      'client-authentication' to better support consuming data models
      that prefer to keep client auth with client definitions than in a
      model principally concerned with the "transport".

   *  In both models, removed the "demux containers", floating the
      nacm:default-deny-write to each descendent node, and adding a note
      to model designers regarding the potential need to add their own
      demux containers.

   *  Fixed a couple references (section 2 --> section 3)

A.13.  12 to 13

   *  Updated to reflect changes in trust-anchors drafts (e.g., s/trust-
      anchors/truststore/g + s/pinned.//)

A.14.  12 to 13

   *  Removed 'container' under 'client-identity' to match server model.

   *  Updated examples to reflect change grouping in keystore module.

A.15.  13 to 14

   *  Removed the "certificate" container from "client-identity" in the
      ietf-tls-client module.

   *  Updated examples to reflect ietf-crypto-types change (e.g.,
      identities --> enumerations)

A.16.  14 to 15

   *  Updated "server-authentication" and "client-authentication" nodes
      from being a leaf of type "ts:certificates-ref" to a container
      that uses "ts:local-or-truststore-certs-grouping".

A.17.  15 to 16

   *  Removed unnecessary if-feature statements in the -client and
      -server modules.

   *  Cleaned up some description statements in the -client and -server
      modules.

   *  Fixed a canonical ordering issue in ietf-tls-common detected by
      new pyang.

A.18.  16 to 17

   *  Removed choice local-or-external by removing the 'external' case
      and flattening the 'local' case and adding a "client-auth-config-
      supported" feature.

   *  Removed choice required-or-optional.

   *  Updated examples to include the "*-key-format" nodes.

   *  Augmented-in "must" expressions ensuring that locally-defined
      public-key-format are "ct:ssh-public-key-format" (must expr for
      ref'ed keys are TBD).

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TLS Clients and Servers      August 2020


A.19.  17 to 18

   *  Removed the unused "external-client-auth-supported" feature.

   *  Made client-indentity optional, as there may be over-the-top auth
      instead.

   *  Added augment to uses of local-or-keystore-symmetric-key-grouping
      for a psk "id" node.

   *  Added missing presence container "psks" to ietf-tls-server's
      "client-authentication" container.

   *  Updated examples to reflect new "bag" addition to truststore.

   *  Removed feature-limited caseless 'case' statements to improve tree
      diagram rendering.

   *  Refined truststore/keystore groupings to ensure the key formats
      "must" be particular values.

   *  Switched to using truststore's new "public-key" bag (instead of
      separate "ssh-public-key" and "raw-public-key" bags.

   *  Updated client/server examples to cover ALL cases (local/ref x
      cert/raw-key/psk).

A.20.  18 to 19

   *  Updated the "keepalives" containers in part to address Michal
      Vasko's request to align with RFC 8071, and in part to better
      align to RFC 6520.

   *  Removed algorithm-mapping tables from the "TLS Common Model"
      section

   *  Removed the 'algorithm' node from the examples.

   *  Renamed both "client-certs" and "server-certs" to "ee-certs"

   *  Added a "Note to Reviewers" note to first page.

A.21.  19 to 20

   *  Modified the 'must' expression in the "ietf-tls-client:server-
      authention" node to cover the "raw-public-keys" and "psks" nodes
      also.

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TLS Clients and Servers      August 2020


   *  Added a "must 'ca-certs or ee-certs or raw-public-keys or psks'"
      statement to the ietf-tls-server:client-authentication" node.

   *  Added "mandatory true" to "choice auth-type" and a "presence"
      statement to its ancestor.

   *  Expanded "Data Model Overview section(s) [remove "wall" of tree
      diagrams].

   *  Moved the "ietf-ssh-common" module section to proceed the other
      two module sections.

   *  Updated the Security Considerations section.

A.22.  20 to 21

   *  Updated examples to reflect new "cleartext-" prefix in the crypto-
      types draft.

A.23.  21 to 22

   *  In both the "client-authentication" and "server-authentication"
      subtrees, replaced the "psks" node from being a P-container to a
      leaf of type "empty".

   *  Cleaned up examples (e.g., removed FIXMEs)

   *  Fixed issues found by the SecDir review of the "keystore" draft.

   *  Updated the "psk" sections in the "ietf-tls-client" and "ietf-tls-
      server" modules to more correctly reflect RFC 4279.
