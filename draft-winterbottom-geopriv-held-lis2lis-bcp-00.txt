Internet-Draft               LIS to LIS BCP                November 2007


1.  Introduction

   The LIS to LIS communication requirements
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-lis2lis-req] describe the need in some
   network environements for one LIS to consult another LIS in order to
   determine the location of a Device.  This document describes how HELD
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] in conjunction with the
   HELD identity extensions
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-identity-extensions] and the HELD
   measurements specification [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements]
   can be used to satisfy these requirements.  No new schema is
   introduced by this document, recipes using existing specifications
   are described.

2.  Terminology

   The key conventions and terminology used in this document are defined
   as follows:

   This document reuses the terms Target, as defined in [RFC3693].

   This document uses the term Location Information Server, LIS, is used
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps].

   Basic terms from the HELD specification
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] are also reused.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Overview

   The network scenario described in
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-lis2lis-req] shows that in some
   environments the LIS publically associated with a Device cannot, on
   its own, determine the location of the Device.  HELD provides a
   specification allowing a Device to obtain location information from a
   Location Information Server (LIS).  This specification extends HELD
   by chaining a location request from the publically accessible LIS to
   a LIS controlled by a regional access provider.  The publically
   accessible LIS can also add measured and identity parameters relating
   to the Device in the HELD locationRequest made to the access provider
   LIS.  Resuing HELD in this manner reduces the number of protocols
   that need to be supported on a LIS, it simplfies development, reduces
   complexity, and improves interoperability.

4.  Detailed Description

   In a typical environment using HELD, the Target discovers the LIS
   using one of the methods described in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-lis-discovery], and makes a request for location
   information.  The ISP LIS receives the location request from the
   Target, adds additional information, and then sends the location
   request on to the regional access provider LIS.  The regional access
   provider LIS uses the extra information provided in the ISP LIS to
   determine the location of the Device and provide the PIDF-LO
   [RFC4119] in the requested form.

   The ISP LIS will, in many cases creates the identity used in the
   "pres" field of the PIDF-LO.  This value needs to be conveyed from
   the ISP LIS to the regional access provider LIS.  HELD can convey
   this value using a URI identity extension as described in
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-identity-extensions].

   The ISP LIS may need to provide Device network attachment
   information, in the form of measurements, to the regional access
   provider LIS to aid it in determing the Device's location.  A
   comprehensive set of measurements and how they are used is provided
   in [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements].  HELD supports the
   inclusion of these additional elements without modification.

   The ISP LIS should not send a request for a location URI to the
   regional access provider LIS.  This is because the regional access
   provider LIS is, in most cases, invisible to entities other than the
   ISP LIS.  A location URI contains the hostname of the LIS that will
   service a location request, which is the ISP LIS and not the regional
   access provider LIS.  Consequently only the ISP LIS should create
   location URIs for the Device.  A regional access provider LIS
   receiving a request for a location URI from an ISP LIS should respond
   with a "cannotProvideLiType" error.

   The ISP LIS should pass all elements included in the Device's
   location request to the regional access provider LIS, with the
   exception of a request for a location URI which was described in the
   previous paragraph.  This behaviour ensures that any new options made
   available to the LIS through HELD can be supported without
   necessarily requiring changes to the ISP LIS.

   The ISP LIS should provide usage in any returned location object that
   match the user's desired settings, or in the absence of these, the
   default settings for <retransmission-allowed> and <retension-expiry>
   as applied by the ISP LIS.

   Basic HELD is provided with an HTTP binding, which is suitable for

   the application of a Device requesting its own location.  Where a
   nailed up connection between two entities and continual transaction
   streaming is required, HTTP may be less appropriate.  In this
   configuration an alternative transport, such as BEEP
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-beep], may be used.

5.  Examples

   In this example a DSL service is provided with an L2TP tunnel forming
   the link between the BRAS in the regional access provider's network,
   and the NAS in the ISP.  The Device has requested a civic location.
   The resulting location request sent from the ISP LIS to the regional
   access provider LIS is shown in Figure 1.


   <locationRequest
          xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held" responseTime="8">
     <locationType>civic</locationType>
     <heldDevice  xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id">
       <uri type="presentity">pres:3sijsskcknckj@ls.example.com</uri>
     </heldDevice>
     <measurements xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:lm">
       <dsl>
         <l2tp>
           <src>192.0.2.10</src>
           <dest>192.0.2.61</dest>
           <session>528</session>
         </l2tp>
       </dsl>
     </measurements>
   </locationRequest>

       Figure 1: LIS to LIS Location Request with L2TP Measurements

   The regional access provider LIS would use the L2TP tunnel
   information to establish the location of the Device.  It would then
   create a PIDF-LO using the URI specified as a <heldDevice> as the
   presentity value.  The resulting location response from the access
   provider LIS to the ISP LIS may look something similar to Figure 2.
   On receiving this response the ISP LIS will need to add the usage
   rules specified by the Device or use local defaults if no Device
   instructions are available.

6.  Security Considerations

   A strong trust relationship needs to exist between the ISP and the
   regional access provider in order for this type of access network to
   operate successfully.  Since this document describes the exchange of
   Device location information between two trusted parties it does not
   mandate the use of any specific crypto techniques but recommends the
   use of TLS with client-side and server-side certificates for
   authentication.
