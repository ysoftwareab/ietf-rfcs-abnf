1.  Introduction

   The updates to RFC 5730 [RFC5730]described in this document provide
   alignment with the 2008 specification for Internationalized Email
   Addresses (EAI) and add support for internationalized email addresses
   in EPP protocol.

   RFC 6530 [RFC6530] introduced the framework for Internationalized
   Email Addresses.  To make such addresses more widely accepted, the
   changes to various protocols need to be introduced.

   The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) specified in RFC 5730
   [RFC5730] is a base document for object management operations and an
   extensible framework that maps protocol operations to objects.  The
   specifics of various objects managed via EPP is described in separate
   documents, RFC 5731 [RFC5731], RFC 5732 [RFC5732], RFC 5733
   [RFC5733], and RFC 5734 [RFC5734].

   RFC 5733 [RFC5733] describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol
   (EPP) mapping for the provisioning and management of individual or
   organizational social information identifiers (known as "contacts")
   stored in a shared central repository.  This document is the only one
   refering to Email address as a property of a managed object.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Updates to RFC 5733

2.1.  Changes to Email Address specification

   Email address is specified in RFC 5733, section 2.6.  The reference
   to the RFC 5322 [RFC5322] is replaced by a reference to RFC 6530.

2.2.  Changes to Email Address XML schema

   The element named 'email' in XML schemas should get the type
   normalizedString instead of eppcom:minTokenType in terms of RFC 5733.

3.  Security Considerations

   Registries SHOULD validate the validity of the domain names in the
   provided email addresses.  This can be done by validating all code
   points according to IDNA2008 [RFC5892].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

5.  Implementation Considerations

   Registries MAY apply extra limitation to the email address syntax
   (e.g. the addresses can be limited to Left-to-Right scripts).  These
   limitations are out of scope of this document.
