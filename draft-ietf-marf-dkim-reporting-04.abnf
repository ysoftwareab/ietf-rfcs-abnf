r= Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The value
      MUST be a dkim-quoted-printable string containing the local-part
      of an e-mail address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail
      bearing this signature fails verification for one of the reasons
      enumerated below.  The value MUST be interpreted as a local-part
      only.  To construct the actual address to which the report is
      sent, the verifier simply appends to this value an "@" followed by
      the domain found in the "d=" tag of the signature whose validation
      failed.  Therefore, a signer making use of this extension tag MUST
      ensure that an email address thus constructed can receive reports
      generated as described in Section 6.

      ABNF:

sig-r-tag = %x72 *WSP "=" *WSP qp-section

ro=  Requested Reports (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The
      value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens representing those
      conditions under which a report is desired.  See Section 5.1 for a
      list of valid tags.

      ABNF:

sig-ro-type = ( "all" / "s" / "v" / "x" )
sig-ro-tag = %x72 %x6f *WSP "=" *WSP sig-ro-type
                    *WSP 0* ( ":" *WSP sig-ro-type )

rp=  Requested Report Percentage (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is
      "100").  The value is a single integer value from 0 to 100
      inclusive that indicates what percentage of incidents of signature
      authentication failures, selected at random, should cause reports
      to be generated.  The report generator SHOULD NOT issue reports
      for more than the requested percentage of incidents.  Report
      generators MAY make use of the "Incidents:" field in [ARF] to
      indicate that there are more reportable incidents than there are
      reports.
      ABNF:

sig-ri-tag = %x72 %x69 *WSP "=" *WSP 1*12DIGIT "/" 1*12DIGIT

rs=  Requested SMTP Error String (text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The
      value is a dkim-quoted-printable string the signing domain
      requests be included in [SMTP] error strings if messages are
      rejected during a single SMTP session.

      ABNF:

sig-rs-tag = %x72 %x73 *WSP "=" qp-section

r= Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The value
      MUST be a dkim-quoted-printable string containing the local-part
      of an e-mail address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail
      claiming to be from this domain failed the verification algorithm
      described in [ADSP], in particular because a message arrived
      without a signature that validates, which contradicts what the
      ADSP record claims.  The value MUST be interpreted as a local-part
      only.  To construct the actual address to which the report is
      sent, the verifier simply appends to this value an "@" followed by
      the domain whose policy was queried in order to evaluate the
      sender's ADSP, i.e., the one taken from the RFC5322.From domain of
      the message under evaluation.  Therefore, a signer making use of
      this extension tag MUST ensure that an email address thus
      constructed can receive reports generated as described in
      Section 6.

      ABNF:

adsp-r-tag = %x72 *WSP "=" qp-section

rp=  Requested Report Percentage (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is
      "100").  The value is a single integer value from 0 to 100
      inclusive that indicates what percentage of incidents of ADSP
      evaluation failures, selected at random, should cause reports to
      be generated.  The report generator SHOULD NOT issue reports for
      more than the requested percentage of incidents.  Report
      generators MAY make use of the "Incidents:" field in [ARF] to
      indicate that there are more reportable incidents than there are
      reports.

ro=  Requested Reports (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The

rs=  Requested SMTP Error String (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).
      The value is a string the signing domain requests be included in
