               Coding and congestion control in transport
               draft-irtf-nwcrg-coding-and-congestion-00

Abstract

   This document discusses the interaction between congestion control
   and coding mechanism at the transport layer.  The scope of the
   document is end-to-end communications.  Examples of interest for the
   proposed solution is to better deal with tail losses or with networks
   with non-congestion losses.  Coding for tunnels is out-of-the scope
   of the document.

1.  Introduction

   There are cases where deploying coding improves the quality of the
   transmission.  As example, the server may hardly detect tail losses
   that impact may impact the application layer.  Another example may be
   the networks where non-congestion losses are persistent and prevent
   the server from exploiting the link capacity.  [RFC5681] defines TCP
   as a loss-based congestion control and coding mechanisms can hide
   congestion signals to the server.  This memo discusses simple best
   practices on how coding and congestion control mechanisms could
   coexist.

   The proposed recommendations apply for coding at the transport or
   application layer and coding for tunnels is out-of-the scope of the
   document.

2.  Separate channels

   Figure 1 presents the notations that will be used in this document
   and introduce the Congestion Control (CC) and Forward Erasure
   Correction (FEC) channels.  Congestion Control channel carries data
   packets (from the server to the client) and a potential information
   signaling the packets that have been received (from the client to the
   server).  Forward Erasure Correction channel carries coded packets
   (from the server to the client) and a potiential information
   signaling the packets that have been repaired (from the client to the
   server).  It is worth pointing out that there are cases where these
   channels are not separated.

    Client                          Server

   +------+                        +------+
   |      | -- { data packet  -----|      |
   |  CC  |                        |  CC  |
   |      | -- received packet } --|      |
   +------+                        +------+

   +------+                        +------+
   |      | -- { coded packet  ----|      |
   | FEC  |                        | FEC  |
   |      | -- repaired packet } --|      |
   +------+                        +------+

3.  Base solution description

   The base solution can be described as follows:

   o  The client MUST indicate to the server that one or multiple
      packets have been recovered using a coding scheme.  Such "repaired
      packet signal" could be based on existing signals (even if the
      existing signal was not designed for that purpose, such as ECN) or
      on new type of signals (such as a RECOVERED frame in QUIC).

   o  The server MUST be able to detect the "recovered packet signal".
      The base solution does not describe how the server reacts to such
      signal.

   The proposed solution applies for coding in the transport layer.  The
   proposed approach is inline with the one in
   [I-D.swett-nwcrg-coding-for-quic].  The proposed solution does not
   applies for the interaction between coding under the transport layer
   (i.e. not end-to-end), such as coding for tunnels.

4.  Server-side coding solutions

   This section presents solutions for a server to add application
   coding.

4.1.  Coded packets without considering CWND progression

   In this solution, the coded packets are sent on top of what is
   allowed by a congestion window.  Examples of the solution could be
   adding a given pourcentage of the congestion window as supplementary
   packets or sending a given amount of coded packets at a given rate.
   The redundancy flow can be decorrelated from the congestion control
   that manages source packets : a secondary congestion control can be
   introduced, such as in coupled congestion control for RTP media
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-coupled-cc].  An example would be to exploit a lower
   than best-effort congestion control [RFC6297].

   The advantage of such solution is that coding would help in
   challenges cases where transmission losses are persistent.

   The drawback of such solution is that it may result in coding
   solutions being unfair towards non-coding solutions.  This solutions
   may result in adding congestion in congested networks.

4.2.  Coded packets driven by CWND progression

   In this solution, the coded packets are sent within what the
   congestion window allows, such as in [CTCP].  Examples of the
   solution would be sending coded packets when there is no more data to
   transmit or preferably send coded packets instead of the following
   packets in the send buffer.

   The advantage of this solution is that it does not contribute in
   adding more congestion than the congestion window allows.  Indeed,
   all traffic (source and redundancy) is controlled by one congestion
   control only and TCP metrics for fairness can be indifferently
   applied in this case.

   The main drawback is the decrease of goodput if coded packets are
   sent but are not used at the client side.

5.  Server-side reaction to recovered packet signals

   Delay-based congestion controls ignore packets that have been
   repaired with coding.  There is no need to define best current
   pratices in this case.  However, more discussions are required for
   congestion controls that use loss as congestion signals (potentially
   among other congestion detection mechanism).

Internet-Draft            Coding and congestion            December 2019


5.1.  The server congestion control considers recovered packet signals
      as congestion-implied packet losses

   In this solution, the server reacts to recovered packet signals as to
   congestion-implied packet losses.  That being said, this does not
   necessarily means that the packets have actually been lost.  The
   server may have other means to identify that the packet was just out-
   of-ordered and ignore the recovered packet signals.

   The advantages of the solution are (1) that coding mechanisms do not
   hide congestion signals, such as packets voluntary dropped by a AQM
   [RFC7567] and (2) packets may be recovered faster than with
   traditionnal retransmission mechanisms.

   The drawback of this solution is that, if there is a high non-
   congestion loss rate, the congestion control throughput may decrease
   drastically.  Reporting this amount of loss to a server may reduce
   the application goodput when there is no actual congestion.

5.2.  The server adapts its window reduction to recovered packet signals

   In this solution, the server does not reduce the congestion window
   with the same amount when the "recovered packet signal" is received,
   i.e. when a packet has been lost but recovered.  Example of this
   solution could be based on [RFC8511] or considering that recovering
   an isolated packet is not an actual sign of congestion.

   The advantage of the solution is that in cases where there is no
   actual congestion, coding could help in improving the transmission
   without ignoring congestion signals.

   The main drawback is the precised design of the solution and its
   interaction with AQM mechanisms [RFC7567].  Moreover there may be
   fairness issues since AIMD convergence may not be guaranteed.

5.3.  The server ignores recovered packet signals

   This is the case for delay-based congestion controls.  The
   interaction between delay-based congestion controls and the delay
   induced by a coding mechanisms is an open research activity.  That
   being said, a potential approach would be that loss-based congestion
   control ignores the "recovered packet signal".

   The advantage of this solution is that coding would provided
   substantial benefits in cases where there are transmission losses.

   However, this solution hides potential congestion losses, making it
   unfair to other congestion controls.

6.  Summary

   This section provides a summary on the content in previous sections.
   The Figure 2 sums up some recommendations.  It is worth pointing out
   that the "coding without congestion" considers that coded packets are
   sent along with original data packets, in opposition with the
   solution where coded packets are transmitted only when there is no
   more original packets to transmit.  Moreover, the values indicated in
   this Figure consider a channel that does not exhibit a high loss
   pattern.
