Abstract

   IP video traffic represents a large fraction of Internet traffic.
   Current infrastructures are not prepared to deal with the increasing
   amount of video traffic. How to transmit video traffic efficiently
   poses traffic management challenges to both network operators and
   Internet applications.

   This document provides use cases where network operator and Internet
   application can be cooperative to improve video transmission
   efficiency, based on the fundamental traffic characteristics (e.g.
   frame priority, adaptive bit rate, etc.).

   Video consumption has grown so fast that bottleneck links can become
   congestion much more easily with video traffic, as the impact in
   terms of bandwidth used of a single video flow is usually much higher
   than other traffic work loads. Globally, IP video traffic will be 82
   percent of all IP traffic (both business and consumer) by 2020, up
   from 70 percent in 2015. 4K Ultra HD technology is by itself a very
   new trend in the overall electronics landscape, and the impact of it
   is growing month by month. 4K content increases the demand for
   network capacity greatly. According to [SD-364], the minimum
   bandwidth for Basic 4K Video streaming is 15Mbps. This is almost two
   times the requirement for Full High Definition (FHD), while Basic 8K
   (at 50 Mbps) requires more than 6 times the FHD bandwidth. In
   particular, future bandwidth demands for the emerging Virtual Reality
   techniques are up to 1 Gbps, which are much higher than 4K or 8K UHD
   streams.

   How to transmit video traffic efficiently poses traffic management
   challenges to both network operators and Internet applications.
   Current existing video transport schemes mainly treat the traffic
   data in a content agnostic fashion, or the usage of deep packet
   inspection (DPI) is required in order to understand the nature of the
   traffic.  Such approaches cannot effectively exploit the limited
   network resources to maximize the perceived quality as video
   streaming is characterized by complex content parameters (e.g., frame
   priority, decoding dependency, etc.).

   This document explore the possibilities where network operator and
   Internet application can be cooperative to improve video transmission
   efficiency, based on the fundamental traffic characteristics,
   adaptive bit rate, etc. Meanwhile, the problem of optimizing the
   delivery of video content to clients while meeting the constraints
   imposed by the available network resources is also considered.

      OLT: Optical Line Terminal

      QoE: Quality of Experience

      TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

2.2.  Definitions

      4K: known as Ultra HD or UHD, is used to describe a new high
      resolution video format with a minimum resolution of 3840 x 2160
      pixels in a 16 x 9 aspect ratio for any display.

3.  Limitation of Current Approaches

3.1.  Content Agnostic

   Currently, video streaming techniques treat network as a "black box"
   and do not make use of feedback that could come from the network.
   Clients shift from one representation to another based on their own
   observations, and they only observe the network state indirectly. If
   several clients are competing for bandwidth, it is possible for them
   to be locked in a vicious circle of switching representations.
   Especially, when encryption is widely used in recent years due to
   concerns about privacy. YouTube traffic is carried via HTTPS (or
   QUIC) since 2014. 

   Content agnostic impacts current network services, such as policy
   control, load balancing, QoS guarantee, etc. For example, 3GPP
   networks have limited radio and transmission resources and need to
   strictly schedule the utilization of radio and transmit resources
   using different granularity of bearers to provide and ensure Quality
   of Service (QoS) for the IP traffic. 

3.2.  Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)

   DPI can solve the issue of content agnostic in some extend. It looks
   at not only the header and footer of a packet, but also examines the
   data part (content) of the packet searching for illegal statements
   and predefined criteria,  allowing a network devices to make a more
   informed decision on whether or not to allow the packet through based
   upon its content. However, it is computationally expensive, which
   will greatly reduce the efficiency of network dealing with the
   packets. And it becomes more and more challenging with the prevalence
   of encrypted media.

4.1.1.  Problem Statement

   4K Ultra HD technology is by itself a very new trend in the overall
   electronics landscape, and the impact of it is growing month by
   month.  As the increasing of the implementations of Ultra HD and to
   keep the increasingly sophisticated customers content while remaining
   profitable at the same time, it is important to design and manage the
   video service based on the user quality of experience (QoE) to
   provide attractive 4K video.  Assessing the QoE of 4K video service
   is therefore essential.

   ITU-T Recommendations (see [ITU-T P.1201] and [ITU-T P.1202], for
   instance) define the models to calculate estimated video quality
   scores that are intended to correlate as closely as possible with
   Mean Opinion Score (MOS) obtained from subjective survey methods.
   These models are very useful for fault localization of QoE
   degradation. In the scenario below, an IPTV provider can implement
   video MOS models in their key network devices, such as core router,
   BRAS (Broadband Remote Access Server), and OLT (Optical Line
   Terminal), to locate where a QoE degradation fault happens in an IP
   video network, as shown in figure 1.

                Figure 1: Video MOS Deployment Example

   In this use case, the video MOS probes may be deployed on some key
   network points for monitoring of transmission quality for operations
   and maintenance purposes.  The network monitoring points are required
   to provide video MOS to the video MOS control center.  By estimating
   the video MOS at different network monitoring points, it is possible
   to perceive several diagnostic signals and reflect the location of
   the impairments on the IP network being measured.

   Traditional way is to implement the network probes in these network
   points which uses DPI or heuristic method to extract the information
   of the stream as the input of these models. However, these methods
   are not efficient and accurate enough, especially the content is
   encrypted. How to evaluate the HTTPS video is becoming a headache of
   network providers. 

4.1.2.  Information Exposed

   If video cooperation transport is considered, the media information
   and prior knowledge about the media stream or streams which will be
   the inputs for the video MOS model can be easily extracted.

4.1.3.  Privacy Impact

   Routers should have some mechanism to verify whether video MOS Model
   inputs provided by application are accurate and dependable.

4.2.1.  Problem Statement

   Different applications have different communication requirements
   [QoS].  In interactive applications of real-time video transmission,
   as well as in virtual reality, the overall one-way delay needs to be
   short in order to give the user an impression of a real-time
   response.  Yet, these applications may be able to tolerate high loss
   rates.  In conventional text and data networking, delay thresholds
   are the least stringent. The response time in these types of
   applications can increase from 2 to 5 seconds before becoming
   unacceptable.  However, given that increased loss reduces the
   throughput of TCP, these applications desire minimal loss.

   Backbone routers in the Internet are typically configured with
   buffers that are several times larger than the product of the link
   bandwidth and the typical round-trip delay on long network paths.
   Such buffers can delay packets for as much as half a second during
   congestion periods.  When such large queues carry heavy TCP traffic
   loads, and are serviced using the Tail-Drop policy, the large queues
   remain close to full most of the time.  Thus, even if each TCP flow
   is able to obtain its share of the link bandwidth, the end-to-end
   delay remains very high.  This is exacerbated for flows with multiple
   hops, since packets may experience high queuing delays at each hop.

   In order to improve the performance, it is desirable for systems to
   react to current stream conditions using rate adaptive transmission
   technology.

4.2.2.  Information Exposed

   When congestion is detected, intelligent packet dropping technique is
   implemented to control congestion due to buffer overflow.  The main
   objective is to drop the packets based on the policy made from the
   information that the application exposed, so that the performance of
   the network is improved.

   [I-D.you-tsvwg-latency-loss-tradeoff] enables an application to
   request treatment for either low-loss or low-latency at a congested
   network link.  The objective is to retain the best- effort service
   while providing low delay to real-time applications at the expense of
   increased loss or providing low loss to non real-time applications at
   the expense of increased delay.  [DSL-IPD] makes use of the fact that
   some packets containing video information (e.g., I-picture or P-
   picture) are more important than others (e.g., B-picture), and this
   importance level can be indicated in the packet header.  When
   congestion in the DSLAM occurs, the low priority packets are
   preferentially dropped.  [IPD] proposes to detect the congestion by
   measuring the length of the queue.  When the buffer occupancy

   increases, the data packets are dropped depending on priority
   assigned to the data packets.  [IPD-TCP] presented DTDRR (Dynamic
   Threshold DRR) and DSDRR (Discard State DRR) as alternatives to QSDRR
   (Queue State DRR) that provide comparable performance, while allowing
   packets to be discarded on arrival, saving memory bandwidth.

   We consider the rate-delay tradeoffs under the assumption that a
   small fraction of packets can be dropped.  It shows that
   intelligently dropping packets can dramatically improve the
   performance in average delay if a non-zero packet drop rate can be
   tolerated.

4.2.3.  Privacy Impact

   Routers should have some mechanism to verify whether the information
   exposed by the application is accurate and dependable.


4.3.  Network Congestion State Feedback

4.3.1.  Problem Statement

   Network congestion typically occurs in the form of router buffer
   overflows, when network nodes are subjected to more traffic than they
   are designed to handle.  With the increasing range of speeds of links
   and the wider use of networks for distributed computing, effective
   control of the network load is becoming more important.

   Current video transported by HTTP uses adapts the network congestions
   by the receivers switch video playback requests between a known set
   of media quality levels based on network conditions. This depends on
   the receiver to detect the network congestion, which is not accurate
   enough and timely. 

   Network components can be involved in congestion control either
   implicitly or explicitly.  In the former, their operation is
   optimized by properly adjusting the configured buffers to support the
   end-to-end congestion control. Implicit mechanisms are realized via
   AQM techniques. In the latter, a feedback signal is issued by an
   explicit signal mechanism (e.g., ECN), which exploits the bits in the
   packet header to convey information regarding the path congestion
   status back to the transmitting source, helping the congestion
   controller to make the necessary decisions towards congestion
   avoidance.

   Most explicit congestion feedback mechanisms work at the transport
   layer or IP layer, which has two limitations: Firstly, some network
   nodes may not support such mechanisms and may remove the explicit

   information completely. This will make the congestion control fail
   down. Secondly, the end users may need to update their operation
   systems to support such feedbacks.

4.3.2.  Information Exposed

   The routers in the network detect congestion and insert this
   information into packets flowing in the forward direction.  This
   information is communicated back to the sender by the destination
   that receives the packets.  This feedback information is examined by
   the sender to control the amount of traffic that is placed on the
   network, for example by setting the control-related TCP properties. 
   This information enables switching of video quality to an appropriate
   bit-rate based on the network congestion state, and preserving the
   important visual information to be transmitted.

4.3.3.  Privacy Impact

   Endpoints should have some mechanisms to verify whether network state
   information is accurate. The exposed information can be used as hints
   for rate determination.


5.  Security Considerations

   Trust relationship between network and user is needed as the provided
   information leads to the accuracy of the video MOS (section 4.1) or
   differentiated operations by both sides (section 4.2 and 4.3).

6.  IANA Considerations
