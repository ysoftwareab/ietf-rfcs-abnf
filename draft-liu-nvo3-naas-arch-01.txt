 1. Introduction

   Network as a Service (NaaS) is a new network business model provided
   by more and more operators. It is a novel class of services for
   cloud computing that provides virtualized E2E connectivity to end
   users at different levels of reliability, traffic QoS and
   transparency in a flexible and scalable way. From the technical
   point of view, the essential part of it is network virtualization.
   That means, virtual network (including sub-network, gateway, network
   routing, bandwidth, network service, etc) as the resource provided
   by operator, can be got on-demand by clients by the way of pay as
   you go service. Clients can make the network provision and use their
   own virtual network flexibly according to specific requirements. By
   this way, operators' network infrastructure can be virtualized and
   multiplexed for selling, and clients can improve the flexibility of
   their network to reduce cost because of better visibility and
   efficient control over their own virtual network.

   The common use case for NaaS is to construct the virtual private
   cloud network (VPCN) for tenant (i.e., enterprise, organization, etc)
   over the public cloud provided by operator. Its main characteristic
   is that tenant can custom their own VPCN, i.e., network topology,
   VPN connection, network services, etc. Following Figure 1 is an
   example for VPCN:

                         Figure 1: VPCN example

   In a VPCN, tenant has several subnets for different application or
   service, gateways work for the inter-subnet traffics. Some network
   services (i.e., NAT, FW, etc) may be needed to work together with
   gateways. If the VPCN provides services to internet, or needs to
   access to internet, the internet gateway is needed to support this.
   The VPCN can also have the VPN gateway for interconnecting tenant's
   branch sites or other VPCNs through VPN connections.

   In addition to the VPCN, a complete NaaS system consists of other
   components. They involve different aspects of NaaS system, i.e.,
   data plane, control plane, management plane. This draft provides an
   high-level overview architecture of NaaS system, and describes how
   every component of it works together from different aspects of NaaS
   system.

 2. Overview

   For better understanding what influence NaaS may introduce into
   current network technologies, this section gives a brief summary of
   new features and main challenges introduced by NaaS.

2.1. New Features

   NaaS introduces a lot of new features to current network for
   consideration; most of them are listed below:

   o Network virtualization: NaaS must support Multi-tenancy
      requirement. And it should hide the implementation details of the
      network infrastructure;

   o Close integration with virtual IT resources (compute, storage):
      NaaS must have the capabilities of VM auto-discovery, integrated
      operation/provision together with IT resources;

   o Elasticity/High Availability: NaaS must have the capabilities of
      on-demand bandwidth allocation, dynamic link/network creation,
      dynamic and geographically distributed pools of shared ICT
      resources, etc;

   o Flexible service chain: Flexible interposition of various middle
      boxes in the NaaS network becomes an essential and valuable
      requirement for it and an IETF WG (SFC: Service Function Chaining)
      has been created to study and resolve the series of requirements;

   o SDN paradigm: SDN is optional paradigm, but provides great
      flexibility and efficiency in network resource management,
      optimized path selection for DC interconnection;

   o Automation: This feature should be achieved in many aspects for
      saving manual labor, which includes automatic collection of the
      network topology information, policy auto distribution, OAM, auto
      recovery, etc;

   o Open interface to user: Making virtual network resource can be
      managed by user themselves. For simplifying the operation, this
      interface should provide network resource
      abstraction/presentation, comprehensive service template, etc.

Internet-Draft          NVO3 NaaS Architecture               June, 2014

2.2. Main Challenges

   Despite the above features introduced by NaaS, a series of
   challenges also appear in front of the implementation, as listed
   below:

   o Constraints of physical DC: Traditional network technologies such
      as vlan, broadcast domain, acl, firewall setting, etc, have put
      so much constraints because of their location dependent feature;

   o Distributed subnet: One L3 subnet can span across the whole DC by
      virtualization technology. Hosts in a L3 subnet are no longer
      limited in one location. This kind of distributed subnet scenario
      brings new challenges of hosts' unified identification and access
      control;

   o Programmable network: SDN paradigm needs to define information
      model and data model used by the related interfaces, and the
      information mapping between overlay and underlay network;

   o On-demand and flexible service chain: It means dynamic service
      awareness and automatic service provision;

   o End to end connection provision: How to provide the End to end
      VPN service to users when the wan/man network and DC network are
      separated? How to integrate enterprise's current infrastructure
      and NaaS in cloud seamlessly and securely? How to guarantee the
      End to end SLA, including bandwidth, latency, etc?

   o Backwards compatibility and smooth migration;

   o Security related issue;

 3. NaaS Architecture

   A complete and high-level architecture of NaaS system is shown in
   Figure 2 followed:

                        Figure 2: NaaS Architecture


   In the above architecture, a NaaS system can divide into 4 layers:

   o Application layer This layer consists of application (APP) and/or
      network management system (NMS). Applications having the
      visibility to network resource is beneficial for them to use
      network resource better. Various standard interfaces can be used
      among applications and orchestrator, i.e., Restful API, Java,
      JSON, netconf, etc. NMS is used for the management or
      configuration of the network devices (i.e., physical/virtual
      switch), policies in controller, etc. NMS is an independent
      system which can communicate and manage objects of every layers;

   o Orchestrator layer: This layer is mainly used for integrating all
      the resource (i.e., computing, store, network, etc) and
      controlling them in centralized way. By providing standard
      interface in northbound and southbound, it can support different
      types of controller and hide the difference from application
      layer;









Liu, et al                                                   [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          NVO3 NaaS Architecture               June, 2014

   o Controller layer: The core layer for the NaaS system. It is
      responsible for transforming service requests from application
      layer into forwarding information (e.g., flow table) in the
      network devices. It collects network states, status and warnings
      from network devices and synthesizes them for the path
      computation. It can distribute various policies (i.e., ACL, QoS,
      access control, etc) to network devices. Controller can be the
      centralized or distributed system. It uses standard protocols
      (i.e., Openflow, Netconf, I2RS [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture], BGP-
      LS [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution], etc) to communicate with
      network devices;

   o Network layer: This layer consists of all the network devices for
      switching traffic, also all the tenant systems (TS) and service
      nodes (SN: i.e., FW, NAT, etc). The network devices and service
      nodes receive the forwarding information and policies from
      controller layer and process the traffic in data plane
      accordingly.

   Four layers of component work together through standard interfaces
   and protocols among them, form a complete and high-level
   architecture of NaaS system.

   In the following sections, NaaS system is described in details from
   different aspects.

 4. Data Plane of NaaS System

   In data plane, NaaS system is mainly related to the network layer.
   Depending on the network scalability and traffic throughput of it,
   the provision of network layer can have two models: centralized NaaS
   network and distributed NaaS network.

4.1. Centralized NaaS Network

   Main characteristic of centralized NaaS network is the centralized
   gateway and related service nodes normally located at the core or
   aggregation layer of network. This deployment model is more suitable
   for small/middle scale network. Most tenant systems are in the layer
   2 network, traffic among them is switched locally. Other types of
   traffic (i.e., inter network traffic, internet traffic, VPN traffic,
   etc) among a small part of tenant systems need to traverse the
   centralized gateway and related services nodes to get the unified
   process.

Internet-Draft          NVO3 NaaS Architecture               June, 2014

4.2. Distributed NaaS Network

   Being opposite to centralized NaaS network, distributed NaaS network
   requires multiple gateways and related service nodes can be
   distributed in different places of network. This helps to improve
   the overall network performance and avoid the single point of
   failure. This deployment model is more suitable for large scale
   network. Most of the inter network traffic is processed locally in
   the distributed gateway and related service nodes.
