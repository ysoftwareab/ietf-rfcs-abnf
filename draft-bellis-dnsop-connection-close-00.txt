                 draft-bellis-dnsop-connection-close-00

Abstract

   This document updates [RFC6891] by specifying a new single-bit flag
   in a DNS response that when seen in a packet carried over a
   connection-orientated transport protocol indicates to the client that
   it should close the current connection.

1.  Introduction

   The DNS protocol [RFC1035] supports use of persistent TCP
   connections, although guidance as to when a connection should be
   terminated (and by which party) is limited [RFC5966].

   This document updates the Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0))
   [RFC6891] by specifying a new single-bit flag in a DNS response that
   when seen in a packet carried over a connection-orientated transport
   protocol indicates to the client that it should close the current
   connection.

   Having the client close the connection reduces the amount of TCP
   state information that must be stored by the server compared to that
   resulting from the server initiating a unilateral close itself.

   TODO: does it make sense to specify a request side meaning for this
   flag, indicating that the server may half-close its "read" side of
   the connection?  This would make the semantics even closer to those
   of the HTTP/1.1 "Connection: close" header (see Section 14.10 of
   [RFC2616])

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Specification

   The "Connection Close" (CC) bit is held in the third-most signifiant
   bit of the third byte of the "extended RCODE and flags" portion of an
   EDNS(0) OPT meta-RR:

                        +0 (MSB)              +1 (LSB)
             +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
          0: |    EXTENDED-RCODE     |        VERSION        |
             +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
          2: |DO| Z|CC|                  Z                   |
             +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   Note to RFC editor: replace the first 'Z' in the figure above with
   'TO' if draft-hzhwm-dprive-start-tls-for-dns is published as an RFC
   before this specification.

4.  Connection Handling

4.1.  Servers

   Servers MAY set this flag to indicate that further queries received
   over the current connection should not be sent.

   An incompatible client will not understand this flag and may continue
   sending requests and therefore the server MUST NOT refuse to service
   subsequent requests.  The server MAY unilaterally close idle
   connections regardless, per [RFC5966] and Section 4.2.2 of [RFC1035]

   Since this flag requires EDNS(0) support, note that this flag cannot
   be set unless the client has indicated support for EDNS(0) by sending
   an OPT meta-RR itself, per Section 7 of [RFC6891]

   TODO: note - the constraint in RFC 6891 appears unnecessarily strict
   - it appears to mandate that the EDNS(0) support indication is on a
   per-request basis, but it would be reasonable on a connection-
   orientated transport to assume that ANY preceding request on that
   connection with an OPT RR is sufficient to indicate that the client
   supports EDNS(0).

   TODO: if a request-side semantic is defined for this flag, what are
   the TCP state-maintenance implications if the server performs a
   'shutdown(fd, SHUT_RD)'?

4.2.  Clients

   Clients receiving a packet with this flag set MUST NOT send any
   further queries over the current connection and MUST initiate closure
   of that connection.

   TODO: what are the TCP state-maintenance implications if the client
   performs a 'shutdown(fd, SHUT_WR)'?

5.  Security Considerations

   None identified (yet).

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA are requested to update the EDNS Header Flag Registry according
   to Section 3.

   Note to IANA and RFC Editor: The actual bit assigned will depend on
   whether any other document specifies a used for the above-specificed
   bit in advance of publication of this document as an RFC.
