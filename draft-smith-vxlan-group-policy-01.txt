1.  Introduction

   The Group Based Policy [GROUPPOLICY][GROUPBASEDPOLICY] model defines
   an application-centric policy model where the application
   connectivity requirements are specified in a manner that is
   independent of the underlying network topology.  In this model,
   Tenant System Interfaces (TSIs) are assigned to Tenant System
   Interface (TSI) Groups.  Each TSI Group consists of TSIs that share
   the same network policies and requirements.  Network policies are
   defined between the TSI Group of the traffic source and the TSI Group
   of the traffic destination.  These policies are deployed when the TSI
   attaches to the network.

   In many situations, the TSI to TSI Group mapping is known only at the
   Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) that the TSI is attached.  This
   implies that the TSI Group of a packet destination may not be known
   until the packet reaches the egress NVE where the packet destination
   is attached.  In such situations, it is critical to retain the source
   TSI Group membership with the packet so that policy can be applied at
   the egress NVE.

   This document defines a backward compatible extension to VXLAN
   [RFC7348] that allows the source TSI Group identifier to be carried
   so that policy can be applied when the destination TSI Group is
   determined at the egress NVE.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Definition of Terms

   This document uses the same terminology as [RFC7365] and [RFC7348].
   In addition, the following terms are used:

   Tenant System Interface (TSI) Group:  A TSI Group is a collection of
             TSIs that share the same network policies and requirements.

2.  Approach

2.1.  VXLAN Group Based Policy Extension

   The VXLAN Group Based Policy Extension (VXLAN-GBP) header is defined
   as:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |G|R|R|R|I|R|R|R|R|D|R|R|A|R|R|R|        Group Policy ID        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |          VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI)       |   Reserved    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                       Figure 1: VXLAN-GBP Extension

   The following bits are defined in addition to the existing VXLAN
   fields:

   G Bit: Bit 0 of the initial word is defined as the G (Group Based
   Policy Extension) bit.

      G = 1 indicates that the source TSI Group membership is being
      carried within the Group Policy ID field as defined in this
      document.

      G = 0 indicates that the Group Policy ID is not being carried, and
      the G Bit MUST be set to 0 as specified in [RFC7348].

   D bit: Bit 9 of the initial word is defined as the Don't Learn bit.
   When set, this bit indicates that the egress VTEP MUST NOT learn the
   source address of the encapsulated frame.

   A Bit: Bit 12 of the initial word is defined as the A (Policy
   Applied) bit.  This bit is only defined as the A bit when the G bit
   is set to 1.

      A = 1 indicates that the group policy has already been applied to
      this packet.  Policies MUST NOT be applied by devices when the A
      bit is set.

      A = 0 indicates that the group policy has not been applied to this
      packet.  Group policies MUST be applied by devices when the A bit
      is set to 0 and the destination Group has been determined.
      Devices that apply the Group policy MUST set the A bit to 1 after
      the policy has been applied.

   Group Policy ID: 16 bit identifier that indicates the source TSI
   Group membership being encapsulated by VXLAN.  The allocation of
   Group Policy ID values is outside the scope of this document.

3.  Backward Compatibility

   VXLAN [RFC7348] requires reserved fields to be set to zero on
   transmit and ignored on receive.  This ensures that the G bit will
   never be set by VXLAN VTEPs and therefore packets received from these
   VTEPs can be assigned to a default Group Policy ID.  It also ensures
   that VXLAN VTEPs receiving packets with the G bit set will ignore the
   Group Policy ID.  Due to this defined behavior by VXLAN VTEPs, it
   allows the extensions described in this document to operate on the
   IANA assigned VXLAN UDP port (port 4789).

   In some environments, there may be a mix of devices supporting the
   VXLAN Group Based Policy Extension and devices that do not.  Devices
   supporting the VXLAN Group Based Policy Extension SHOULD assign
   traffic arriving without the G bit set to a default Group Policy ID
   for the purposes of policy enforcement.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes an extension to VXLAN to carry the Group
   Policy Identifier of the source endpoint.  These identifiers must be
   distributed to participating VTEPs that are encapsulating traffic
   from the endpoints sourcing traffic.  While the control plane
   protocols for distributing these identifiers is outside the scope of
   this document, any control plane protocol should ensure that these
   identifiers are securely distributed to the network elements
   participating in the policy enforcement domain.

   Additionally, the Group Policy Identifier field being carried in the
   packet directly impacts the network policy applied to the traffic.

   There is a risk that these identifiers may be spoofed and proper
   integrity protection should be put in place to ensure that these
   fields can only be populated by trusted entities.  Due to the
   importance of these fields, confidentiality may also be required to
   ensure that traffic cannot be targeted for attack based on the policy
   identifiers.  In some environments, these attacks are mitigated
   through physical security.  In other environments, traditional
   security mechanisms like IPsec that authenticate and optionally
   encrypt VXLAN traffic including the bits and fields described in this
   document.
