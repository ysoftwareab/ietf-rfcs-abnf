1.  Introduction

   This document defines the group-based policy (GBP) encapsulation for
   Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].  The GBP sub-header carries a 16-bit
   group policy ID that is semantically equivalent to the 16-bit group
   policy ID defined in [I-D.smith-vxlan-group-policy].

2.  Conventions

2.1.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Abbreviations

   Abbreviations used in this document:

   GBP:       Group-Based Policy

   Geneve:    Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation

3.  Group Based Policy Encapsulation in Geneve

   For encapsulating group policy IDs into Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve]
   the group policy ID field is included in the Geneve header using
   tunnel options.  The group policy ID field uses a tunnel option class
   specific for GBP.  In an administrative domain where GBP is used,
   insertion of the GBP tunnel option in Geneve is enabled at the Geneve
   tunnel endpoints.  The Geneve header is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].  GBP semantics are described in
   [I-D.smith-vxlan-group-policy].

   The packet format of the GBP ID when encapsulated in Geneve is
   defined below.

          Figure 1: Group Based Policy as a Geneve Tunnel Option

   The GBP header consists of 8 octets, as illustrated in Figure 1.  The
   first 4 octets are the Geneve Tunnel Option header
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve], whose format is as follows:

   Option Class:  16-bit unsigned integer that determines the GBP option
      class.  The value is from the IANA registry setup for Geneve
      option classes as defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].

   Type:  8-bit unsigned integer defining the GBP ID type.  Two values
      are defined:

      GBP_Source_ID:  The Group Policy ID associated with the source of
         the packet.

      GBP_Destination_ID:  The Group Policy ID associated with the end
         destination of the packet.

      Note that if the packet carries a GBP_Destination_ID, it MUST also
      carry a GBP_Source_ID.

   R (3 bits):  Option control flags reserved for future use.  MUST be
      zero on transmission and ignored on receipt.

   Length:  5-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the GBP HDR in 4-octet
      units.

   The next 4 octets are the GBP header, whose format is as follows:

   Group Policy ID:  16-bit group policy identifier as as defined in
      [I-D.smith-vxlan-group-policy].

   Policy Applied bit (A bit):  The A bit is set to 0 to indicate that
      the group policy has not (yet) been applied to this packet.  Group
      policies MUST be applied by devices when the A bit is set to 0 and

Internet-Draft          GBP Geneve Encapsulation              March 2018


      the destination group has been determined.  Devices that apply the
      group policy MUST set the A bit to 1 after the policy has been
      applied.  The A bit is set to 1 to indicate that the group policy
      has already been applied to this packet.  Policies that redirect
      the packet MUST NOT be applied by devices when the A bit is set.
      Policies that cause the packet to be dropped MAY be applied.

   Don't Learn bit (D bit):  The D bit is set to 1 to indicate that the
      tunnel endpoint MUST NOT learn the source address of the
      encapsulated frame.

   Reserved (14 bits):  reserved for future use.  MUST be zero on
      transmission and ignored on receipt.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a Geneve "option class" number for GBP:

                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+
                 | Option Class  | Description | Reference     |
                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+
                 | x             | GBP_ID      | This document |
                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of Geneve are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].  The security considerations of GBP are
   discussed in [I-D.smith-vxlan-group-policy].

   Additionally, the security policy value carried in the GBP header
   impacts security directly.  There is a risk that this identifier
   could be altered.  Accordingly, the network should be designed such
   that this header can be inserted only by trusted entities, and can
   not be altered before reaching the destination.  This can be
   mitigated through physical security of the network and/or by
   encryption or validation of the entire packet, including the GBP.
