1. Introduction 

   The term "Voice over IP Peering" (VoIP Peering) has   historically 
   been used to describe a wide variety of aspects pertaining to the 
   interconnection of service provider networks and to the delivery of 
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP [2]) call termination over those 
   interconnections. 

   The discussion of these interconnections has at times been confused 
   by the fact that the term "peering" is used in various contexts to 
   relate to interconnection at different levels in a protocol stack. 
   Session Peering for Multimedia Interconnect focuses on how to 
   identify and route real-time sessions (such as VoIP calls) at the 
   application layer, and it does not (necessarily) involve the exchange 
   of packet routing data or media sessions. In particular, "layer 5 
   network" is used here to refer to the interconnection between SIP 
   servers, as opposed to interconnection at the IP layer ("layer 3").  
   The term "peering" will be used throughout the remainder of the 
   document for the purpose of indicating a layer 5 interconnection.

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology            January 2008 
 
 
   This document introduces standard terminology for use in 
   characterizing real-time session peering. Note however, that while 
   this document is primarily targeted at the VoIP peering case, the 
   terminology described here is applicable to those cases in which 
   service providers peer using SIP signaling (defined as SIP Service 
   Providers, See Section 3.9) for non-voice or quasi-real-time 
   communications. 

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2 
   provides the general context for the SPEERMINT Working Group. Section 
   3 provides the general definitions for real-time SIP based 
   communication, with initial focus on the VoIP peering case, and 
   Section 4 defines the terminology describing the various forms of 
   peering. Finally, Section 5 introduces the concept of federations. 

2.  SPEERMINT Context 

   The context of SPEERMINT provides a framework of peering while 
   leveraging the building blocks of existing IETF defined protocols 
   (e.g. SIP [2], ENUM [4], etc.).  While the SPEERMINT working group 
   defines the use of these protocols in peering, it does not redefine 
   how these protocols input and/or output the important variables 
   necessary for creating Session Establishment Data (SED) (see Section 
   3.3 for additional detail) or the methods for which this data will be 
   used during the peering process.  For example, while the SPEERMINT 
   working group is not limited (or coupled in any way) to the use of 
   E.164 numbers, an E.164 number [5] may be used as a key in an E.164 
   to Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) mapping (ENUM [4]). The result 
   of this step (which involves looking up Naming Authority Pointer 
   (NAPTR) records in the DNS) is a SIP URI.  The process for deriving 
   this information has already been defined in [4], but is used as a 
   building block for SPEERMINT SED, on which the subsequent call 
   routing is based. Note that the call routing step does not depend on 
   the presence of an E.164 number. Indeed, the resulting SIP URI may no 
   longer even contain numbers of any type. In particular, the SIP URI 
   can be advertised in various other ways, such as on a web page. 

   Finally, note that the term "call" is being used here in the most 
   general sense, i.e., call routing and session routing are used 
   interchangeably. 

3. General Definitions 

3.1. Signaling Path Border Element 

   A signaling path border element (SBE) provides signaling functions 
   such as protocol inter-working (for example, H.323 to SIP), identity 
   and topology hiding, and Call Admission Control (CAC) for a domain. 

 
 
Malas & Meyer           Expires July 29, 2008                  [Page 3] 
Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology            January 2008 
 
 
   Such an SBE is frequently (but need not be) deployed on a domain's 
   border. 

3.2. Data Path Border Element 

   A data path border element (DBE) provides media-related functions 
   such as deep packet inspection and modification, media relay, and 
   firewall support under SBE control. As was the case with the SBE, a 
   DBE is frequently deployed on a domain's border. 

3.3. Session Establishment Data 

   Session Establishment Data, or SED, is the data used to route a call 
   to the next hop associated with the called domain's ingress point. A 
   domain's ingress point can be thought of as the location derived from 
   the NAPTR/SRV/A record [1] that resulted from the resolution of the 
   SIP URI. 

   More specifically, the SED is the set of parameters that the outgoing 
   SBEs need to complete the call, and may include: 

     . A destination SIP URI 

     . A SIP proxy or ingress SBE to send the INVITE to, including 

          o  Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) 

          o  Port 

          o  Transport Protocol (UDP/TCP/TLS [9/10/11]) 

     . Security Parameters, including 

          o  TLS certificate to use 

          o  TLS certificate to expect 

          o  TLS certificate verification setting 

     . Optional resource control parameters such as 

          o  Limits on the total number of call initiations to a peer 

          o  Limits on SIP transactions/second 

3.4. Call Routing 

   Call routing is the set of processes and rules used to route a call 
   and any subsequent mid-dialog SIP requests to their proper (SIP)

   destination.  More generally, call routing can be thought of as the 
   set of processes and rules, which are used to route a real-time 
   session to its termination point. 

3.5. PSTN 

   The term "PSTN" refers to the Public Switched Telephone Network. In 
   particular, the PSTN refers to the collection of interconnected 
   circuit-switched voice-oriented public telephone networks, both 
   commercial and government-owned.  In general, PSTN terminals are 
   addressed using E.164 numbers; various dial-plans (such as emergency 
   services dial-plans), however, may not directly use E.164 numbers. 

3.6. IP Path 

   For purposes of this document, an IP path is defined to be a sequence 
   of zero or more IP router hops. 

3.7. Peer Network 

   This document defines a peer network as the set of SIP user agents 
   (UAs) (customers) that are controlled by a single administrative 
   domain and can be reached via some IP path. Note that such a peer 
   network may also contain end-users who are located on the PSTN (and 
   hence may also be interconnected with the PSTN), as long as they are 
   also reachable via some IP path. 

3.8. Service Provider 

   A Service Provider (or SP) is defined to be an entity that provides 
   layer 3 (IP) transport of SIP signaling and media packets. Example 
   services may include, but are not limited too, Ethernet Private Line 
   (EPL), Frame Relay, and IP VPN.  An example of this may be an 
   Internet Service Provider (ISP). 

3.9. SIP Service Provider 

   A SIP Service Provider (or SSP) is an entity that provides 
   application services utilizing SIP signaling to its customers. In the 
   event that the SSP is also a function of the SP, it may also provide 
   media streams to its customers.  Such a SSP may additionally be 
   peered with other SSPs. A SSP may also interconnect with the PSTN.  A 
   SSP may also be referred to as an Internet Telephony Service Provider 
   (ITSP). While the terms ITSP and SSP are frequently used 
   interchangeably, this document and other subsequent SIP peering 
   related documents should use the term SSP. SSP more accurately 
   depicts the use of SIP as the underlying layer 5 signaling protocol.

4. Peering 

   While the precise definition of the term "peering" is the subject of 
   considerable debate, peering in general refers to the negotiation of 
   reciprocal interconnection arrangements, settlement-free or 
   otherwise, between operationally independent service providers. 

   This document distinguishes two types of peering, Layer 3 Peering and 
   Layer 5 peering, which are described below. 

4.1. Layer 3 Peering 

   Layer 3 peering refers to interconnection of two service providers' 
   networks for the purposes of exchanging IP packets which destined for 
   one (or both) of the peer's networks. Layer 3 peering is generally 
   agnostic to the IP payload, and is frequently achieved using a 
   routing protocol such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [6] to 
   exchange the required routing information. 

   An alternate, perhaps more operational definition of layer 3 peering 
   is that two peers exchange only customer routes, and hence any 
   traffic between peers terminates on the peer's network or the peer's 
   customer's network. 

4.2. Layer 5 Peering 

   Layer 5 (Session) peering refers to interconnection of two SSPs for 
   the purposes of routing real-time (or quasi-real time) call signaling 
   between their respective customers using SIP methods.  Such peering 
   may be direct or indirect (see Section 4.2.1 and Section 4.2.2 
   below). Note that media streams associated with this signaling (if 
   any) are not constrained to follow the same set of IP paths. 

4.2.1. Direct Peering 

   Direct peering describes those cases in which two SSPs peer without 
   using an intervening layer 5 network. 

4.2.2. Indirect Peering 

   Indirect, or transit, peering refers to the establishment of either a 
   signaling and media path or signaling path alone via one (or more) 
   transit network(s). In this case it is generally required that a 
   trust relationship is established between the originating SSP and the 
   transit network on one side; and, the transit network representing 
   the termination network on the other side.

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology            January 2008 
 
 
4.2.3. On-demand Peering 

   SSPs are said to peer on-demand when they are able to exchange 
   traffic without any pre-association prior to the origination of a 
   real-time transaction (like a SIP message) between the domains. Any 
   information that needs to be exchanged between domains in support of 
   peering can be learned through a dynamic protocol mechanism.  On-
   demand peering can occur as direct or indirect. 

4.2.4. Static Peering 

   SSPs are said to peer statically when pre-association between 
   providers is required for the initiation of any real-time 
   transactions (like a SIP message).  Static peering can occur as 
   direct or indirect.  An example of static peering is a federation.  
   Each of the peers within the federation must first agree on a common 
   set of rules and guidelines for peering, thus pre-associating with 
   each other prior to initiating session requests. 

4.3. Functions 

   The following are terms associated with the functions required for 
   peering. 

4.3.1. Look-Up Function 

   The Look-Up Function (LUF) provides a mechanism for determining for a 
   given request the target domain to which the request should be 
   routed. 

4.3.2. Location Routing Function 

   The Location Routing Function (LRF) determines for the target domain 
   of a given request the location of the SF in that domain and 
   optionally develops other SED required to route the request to that 
   domain. 

   In some cases, some entity (usually a 3rd party or federation) 
   provides peering assistance to the originating SSP by providing this 
   function.  The assisting entity may provide information relating to 
   direct (Section 4.2.1) or indirect (Section 4.2.2) peering as 
   necessary. 

4.3.3. Signaling Function 

   The SF performs routing of SIP requests for establishing and 
   maintaining calls, and to assist in the discovery/exchange of 
   parameters to be used by the Media Function (MF). 

 
 
Malas & Meyer           Expires July 29, 2008                  [Page 7] 
Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology            January 2008 
 
 
4.3.4. Media Function 

   The MF performs media related functions such as media transcoding and 
   media security implementation between two SSPs. 

5. Federations 

   A federation is a group of SSPs which agree to receive calls from 
   each other via SIP, and who agree on a set of administrative rules 
   for such calls (settlement, abuse-handling, ...) and the specific 
   rules for the technical details of the peering. 

   A federation may provide some or all of the following functionality: 

     . Common static policies 

          o  Routing 

          o  Domain 

          o  Location 

          o  Next hop 

          o  Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) 

     . Common dynamic policies 

          o  Congestion control 

          o  Codec preference 

          o  Authentication preference 

          o  Quality monitoring capabilities (e.g. RTP Control Protocol 
             (RTCP) [7], RTCP Extended Reports (RTCP XR) [8]) 

          o  Transport protocols (e.g. TCP, UDP) 

     . Policy management (enforcement) 

          o  Ad-hoc 

          o  Published in the DNS, or 

          o  Policy might also be managed by a federation entity 

     . A federated ENUM root

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology            January 2008 
 
 
     . Address resolution mechanisms 

     . Session signaling (via federation policy) 

     . Media streams (via federation policy) 

     . Federation security policies 

     . Peering policies 

     . Other layer 2 and layer 3 policies 

     . Security parameters 

     . Optional resource control parameters 

     Finally, note that a SSP can be a member of 

          o  No federation (e.g., the SSP has only bilateral peering 
             agreements) 

          o  A single federation 

          o  Multiple federations 

     and an SSP can have any combination of bi-lateral and multi-
     lateral (i.e., federated) peers.

7. Security Considerations 

   This document introduces no new security considerations. However, it 
   is important to note that session peering, as described in this 
   document, has a wide variety of security issues that should be 
   considered in documents addressing both protocol and use case 
   analyzes.
