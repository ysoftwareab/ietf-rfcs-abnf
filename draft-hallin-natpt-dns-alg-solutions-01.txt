Internet-Draft          NAT-PT DNS ALG solutions               July 2002


1. Introduction

   NAT-PT is an IPv6 to IPv4 transition mechanism that enables IPv6-only
   clients to use IPv4 services.  NAT-PT works by combining protocol
   translation with [NAT].

   Due to the long address format of IPv6 it is believed that IPv6 users
   will use DNS a lot.  To enable DNS traffic through a NAT-PT a special
   Application Level Gateway (ALG) is provided.  The DNS-ALG within a
   NAT-PT will be a very important component.  Some problems have been
   recognized with the DNS-ALG described in [NAT-PT].  The issues
   discussed include that packets will be translated even when it is not
   necessary and that all IPv6 traffic has to go through the NAT-PT,
   whether or not it is translated.  Protocol translation is a potential
   bottleneck and it is important to limit its use.  This document will
   describe possible solutions to some of these problems as well as to
   other issues with the DNS ALG functionality in NAT-PT.

2. Solutions to some of the problems described in [NAT-PT-ISSUES]

2.1 AAAA answers for A queries

   [NAT-PT-ISSUES] points out that it is not specified in [NAT-PT] how a
   DNS ALG should treat answers to A queries from internal hosts.

   This problem arises due to stateless nature of DNS ALG.  If DNS-ALG
   had kept information about the (A) query, then incoming (A) reply
   could be mapped to that query using previously stored information.  A
   DNS query contains {queryid, type}, which could be matched against
   {replyid, type} in the DNS response.  Additionally, the tuple
   {srcaddr, dstaddr, sport, dport, proto} will be used for integrity
   check.  Once a DNS reply is received and processed, the associate
   state will be removed by DNS ALG.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   => NAT-PT DNS-ALG will match DNS replies with queries using the
   minimal state stored when a DNS query, sent by IPv6-only nodes,
   traversed NAT-PT.  This will ensure that a host sending (A) query
   will always recieve (A) reply, but not (AAAA) reply.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 Source Address Selection/Destination ordering

   [NAT-PT-ISSUES] illustrates that the communication between a node
   within the NAT-PT domain and an external dual-stack host, will select
   the translated path over the native IPv6 path.

   Let's assume that an IPv6-only node X within a NAT-PT domain wants to

Internet-Draft          NAT-PT DNS ALG solutions               July 2002


   communicate with a dual-stack host Y on the public Internet.  The
   host Y has published both IPv4 (A) and IPv6 (AAAA) addresses in the
   DNS.  X will query IPv6 (AAAA) for Y.  The NAT-PT will intercept the
   IPv6 DNS query.  In the NAT-PT standard it is specified that the DNS-
   ALG should forward the intercepted IPv6 queries in an unchanged
   version together with a translated IPv4 DNS query (A) to the DNS
   server.  The DNS server will return both an IPv4 and an IPv6 DNS
   reply to the NAT-PT.  The idea is that the IPv4 DNS reply will have
   an empty answer section if the destination host is IPv6 and that the
   IPv6 DNS reply will have an empty answer section if the destination
   host is IPv4.  Both DNS replies are forwarded to the requesting IPv6
   client.  The IPv6 DNS reply will be forwarded in unchanged form and
   the IPv4 DNS reply will be translated to an IPv6 DNS reply.  The
   requesting client will receive two IPv6 DNS replies, one empty and
   one containing the IPv6 address of the destination host.  Depending
   on if the destination host is IPv4 or IPv6, the address will either
   be a native IPv6 or a translated IPv4 address.

   This works fine when communicating with IPv6-only or IPv4-only hosts.
   Problems occur when the destination host is dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 such
   as the host Y.  The client will then receive two IPv6 DNS replies
   with answer sections containing addresses.  As the prefix associated
   to the translated address belongs to same site as X's IPv6 address,
   when X will use source address selection/destination address ordering
   it will result to longest prefix match and will choose the
   "translated" address over the native one.  The result is that
   protocol translation will be used even if native IPv6 communication
   is possible.

   An alternate approach is for the DNS ALG to send the IPv6 DNS query
   in unchanged form, but ignore to send the translated IPv4 DNS query.
   The returning IPv6 DNS reply is analysed.  If the answer section of
   the IPv6 DNS reply contains addresses, it is forwarded in unchanged
   form to the IPv6-only client.  A special case is if the IPv6 DNS
   reply contains the name error flag, in this case the domain name does
   not exist and the IPv6 DNS reply can be forwarded to the IPv6 only
   client in unchanged form.

   If the answer section of the IPv6 DNS reply does not contain any
   addresses and the name error flag is not set, it is probable that the
   destination host is IPv4 and protocol translation is required.  The
   DNS reply is then converted to an IPv4 DNS request and sent to the
   DNS server.  The returning IPv4 DNS reply will be translated to IPv6
   and forwarded to the IPv6-only client.  The negative effect of this
   method is increased DNS latency when communicating with IPv4-only
   hosts.  This is because the empty IPv6 DNS message has to arrive to
   the NAT-PT before the IPv4 (a) request can be sent.

   A second alternative is to send both AAAA and A (translated AAAA)
   queries simultaneously.  The returning replies are analyzed.  If the
   answer section does not contain any address, DNS-ALG will silently
   discard this reply.  If the answer section contains an IPv6 address,
   AAAA reply should be forwarded unchanged.  If the first returned
   reply is an IPv4 address, DNS-ALG will hold this for N time units,
   after which the A reply will be translated to AAAA and forwarded.
   Within the time interval of N units, if a AAAA answer is returned,
   AAAA reply will be sent and (A) will be discarded.  The exact value
   of N is implementation dependant and is usually short enough not to
   cause a DNS timeout at the IPv6-only client.

Internet-Draft          NAT-PT DNS ALG solutions               July 2002


2.3 NAT-PT & IPv6 default router

   The NAT-PT DNS ALG makes the assumption that the DNS traffic goes
   through the NAT-PT box.  [NAT-PT-ISSUES] describes that this is ok
   when DNS resolution is done over IPv4.  However, if it is done over
   IPv6, there is no reason why the DNS traffic will still go through
   the NAT-PT box unless the NAT-PT box is also the default IPv6 router
   of the site.  The conclusion is that NAT-PT has to be the only
   default IPv6 router in the NAT-PT domain to work correctly with DNS-
   ALG.

   This implicates that all IPv6 traffic has to go through the NAT-PT,
   whether or not it is translated.  This raises scalability issues in
   larger networks.  In a network with both IPv6-only and dual-stack
   hosts, this would require dual-stack hosts to be connected to a NAT-
   PT.  This would not make any sense, since dual-stack hosts have no
   need for the services a NAT-PT provides (The exception is when NAT-PT
   is used in conjunction with DSTM).

   However, a more scalable approach is that IPv6-only clients connected
   to the NAT-PT, do all IPv6 DNS resolution over translated IPv4.  The
   IPv6-only clients set NAT-PT_PREFIX:ipv4_dns as their DNS server,
   where NAT-PT_PREFIX is the NAT-PT prefix in the NAT-PT domain and
   ipv4_dns is a DNS server in the IPv4 domain.  All DNS messages will
   then be routed through the NAT-PT.  Dual-stack nodes will continue to
   use their ordinary DNS server.  Their DNS traffic will not be routed
   through the NAT-PT.  Thus, dual-stack nodes have no contact with the
   NAT-PT in the network.  The NAT-PT is not required to be the default
   IPv6 router of the site.  Only traffic in need of translation will be
   routed through the NAT-PT.  This set up works provided that the IPv4
   DNS server supports IPv6 DNS.

   An alternate approach is that IPv6-only nodes will define a DNS
   search list, where the IPv6 DNS server, reachable locally, is defined
   first, and NAT-PT_PREFIX:ipv4_dns appears next in that order.  IPv6-
   only nodes that want to resolve AAAA (IPv6) names do not have to send
   DNS queries through NAT-PT.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   => It is not necessary for the NAT-PT to be the only default router
   in the IPv6 domain.  The only traffic that has to go through the NAT-
   PT is the one that needs to be translated.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4 IPv4 Address assignment for incoming connections (IPv4 to IPv6)

   IPv4 Address assignment for incoming connections (IPv4 to IPv6) works
   the same way as described in [NAT-PT].  If a network administrator is

   cautious about denial of service attacks, it is possible not to
   configure forwarding to the IPv6 DNS server.  IPv6 nodes with static
   bindings can still be reached from IPv4 by registering them in the
   IPv4 DNS server.  Another method is to enable IPv6 on IPv4 nodes
   wanting to communicate with IPv6-only nodes.

3. Solutions to additional problems with the NAT-PT DNS ALG

3.1 Reverse queries from IPv6 to IPv4

   The DNS-ALG described in [NAT-PT] does not support reverse queries
   from IPv6 to IPv4.  Reverse querying is an important feature to
   support.  For example, some applications uses reverse queries to
   check if the result of a name lookup is correct.  By using the minor
   extension to [NAT-PT] presented below reverse querying from IPv6 to
   IPv4 is enabled.

   If the IPv6 address in the IPv6 reverse query starts with the NAT-PT
   prefix, the DNS-ALG understands that this is a reverse query for an
   IPv4 node.  The DNS-ALG will check for address binding to see if a
   mapping exists between the IPv6 address in PTR query and an IPv4
   address.  If there is a mapping the PTR query will be translated to
   IPv4.  The translation works by replacing the string "IP6.INT" with
   "IN-ADDR.ARPA" and replacing the IPv6 address with the bound IPv4
   address (in reverse order).  Reverse queries concerning IPv6
   addresses that don't start with the NAT-PT prefix is forwarded to the
   DNS server in unchanged form.  This enables correct reverse lookup of
   both native IPv6 and translated IPv4 addresses.


   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   => It is possible to support IPv6 to IPv4 reverse querying with minor
   additions to [NAT-PT].
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------



3.2 Truncated DNS messages

   When the DNS-ALG described in [NAT-PT] translates DNS replies from
   IPv4 to IPv6, it replaces the included IPv4 addresses with IPv6
   addresses.  An IPv4 address is 4 bytes long, while an IPv6 address is
   16 bytes long.  The result is that the translated message will be
   longer than the original message.  DNS messages are usually sent
   using UDP.  When transferring DNS messages over UDP, 512 bytes is the
   maximum DNS message length.

   The obvious approach when implementing a DNS ALG is to truncate

   translated DNS messages that exceed the maximum message length.
   However, some applications have problems with truncated DNS messages.
   Another possible solution is to remove resource records in the
   additional section of the DNS message and avoid truncation.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   => By removing resource records in the additional section, problems
   with truncated DNS messages are avoided while essentially providing
   the same information in the DNS message.

3.3 DSTM cannot work with NAT-PT DNS-ALG

   [INTERACTION] points out that DSTM mechanism will never be triggered
   and used, because a host within the IPv6 domain will never receive a
   DNS response that contains an "A" record.

   Section 2.1 presents the same problem.  Clearly, the proposed
   solution will enable DSTM to work with NAT-PT DNS-ALG.

4. Security Considerations

   The security issues identified in [NAT-PT-ISSUES] are still unsolved.
