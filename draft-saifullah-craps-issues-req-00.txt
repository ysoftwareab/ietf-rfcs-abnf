INTERNET-DRAFT        CRAPS Issues and Requirements         23 June 2000


1.  Introduction

   The CRAPS BOF has the intention to charter a working group to provide
   a handover protocol between access points of different radio
   technology. The working group has also the intention to work on 
   simplifying the radio network protocols by pushing all the 
   radio-related functions downinto the BSs. This document discusses a 
   set of issues which need to be resolved in achieving the above 
   mentioned goals. The idea is to identify the challenges, so the CRAPS 
   group as a whole can discuss the possible solutions.

   This document also identifies a set of requirements, which are
   inferred as a result of the consideration of the issues. These
   requirements can be utilized alongwith the requirements identified in
   [1].



2.  Terminology


   Mobile Terminal (MT)
      A user terminal with an IP client. Also called the Mobile Node or
      Mobile Station.


   Base Station (BS)
      A network element which comprises of radio transmission and
      reception devices. Also called the Base Transceiver Station (BTS)
      or Node-B.


   Radio Access Network (RAN)
      This is a wired network that connects MT and the core network. The
      RAN may comprise of RNC and BS. Also called the Base Station
      Sub-system (BSS).


   Radio Network Controller (RNC)
      This acts as a gateway to the RAN and provides control to a group
      of base stations. Also called the Base Station Controller (BSC).


   Soft handoff
      A process by which a moving CDMA MT is transferred between the BSs.
      In soft handoff, a connection between the MT and the network is
      established and may be maintained indefinitely with the two or more
      BS serving the session.

INTERNET-DRAFT        CRAPS Issues and Requirements         23 June 2000


   Frame Selection/Distribution
      This function is responsible for selecting the best incoming air
      interface reverse link frame from the channel elements involved in
      the soft handoff. It also distributes forward air interface frames
      to all the channel elements involved in a call.  Also called the
      macrodiversity combiner (MDC) or selection and Distribution Unit
      (SDU).


   Seamless Handoff
      A handoff procedure which does not result in any communication
      break noticeable by a user. This procedure has strict timing
      requirement for the execution and is tolerant to some packet loss.


   Lossless Handoff
      A Handoff procedure which does not result in any packet loss.
      This procedure is not allowed to loose any user data and is
      tolerant to some delay in the procedure execution.




3.  Issues


3.1.  Congestion Control and Load Balancing

   A centralized radio resource manager (RRM) is used in traditional RANs
   to manage the resources in its BSs in order to increase the call 
   success rate. The RRM keeps track of the assigned/unassigned resources
   in all the BSs it manages and redirects call originations attempts to
   neighbor BSs when appropriate. This may happen due to radio
   congestion, equipment failure, etc. A centralized RRM also helps in
   avoiding congestion by performing non-imperative handovers to balance
   the traffic among different BSs.

   The CRAPS WG shall consider how to provide congestion control and
   load balancing without any centralized radio resource manager, and by
   achieving the same level of optimizatons possible with a centralized RRM.


3.2.  Paging Management

   In cellular networks the concept of "paging area" (or location area) is
   defined. Paging areas are used to locate an MT in idle mode in order to
   deliver incoming calls. The MT in idle mode keeps the network informed
   of its location at the level of paging area, i.e. indicates its current
   


Saifullah and Faccin                                            [Page 2]





INTERNET-DRAFT        CRAPS Issues and Requirements         23 June 2000


   paging area to the network any time there is a change in the paging 
   area. A paging area usually encompasses more than a BS area, so that the
   MT does not drain its battery out by performing frequent paging area
   updates. At the same time, the size of paging areas shall be such that 
   the signaling load resulting from paging is minimized. Paging area size
   is calculated optimizing the trade off between the two aspects described
   above.

   The challenge for CRAPS WG is to manage paging area without involving
   any radio specific functions above the BSs.


3.3.  Location Based Services

   The Location Based Services are important feature of cellular networks.
   Moreover, the provision of the MT location during emergency calls is
   mandatory in some jurisdictions with a specified accuracy in location
   estimate. The location determination for a target MT is an essential
   part of the Location Based Services. The location determination
   function traditionally resides inside the RNC because it uses an overall
   co-ordination, collection and calculation functions based on the 
   measurements received by the different BSs and the MT.  

   The CRAPS WG needs to define a mechanism to allow the determination of
   the MT location, which does not need any function to be centrally located
   over BSs, and is also independent of the BS RF technology.


3.4.  Efficient and Economical Radio Resource usage

   The frequency spectrum in commercial large scale cellular networks is
   limited and expensive, thus it is important for such radio networks to 
   have radio resource management optimized for an efficient use of the 
   available spectrum. In the existing cellular radio networks the 
   optimization is performed in many ways. For instance, by assigning radio 
   resource after terrestrial resource assignment in a call setup, by 
   performing call audit between the BS and the call processing agent to
   release any stuck radio resources, etc.

   The CRAPS WG needs to consider efficient and economical radio
   resource management in the protocol set development.


3.5.  Robust Header Compression

   The idea of IP transport over the wireless link allow full deployment
   of the end-to-end IP model and the adoption of IP applications in the MT.
   One main problem in this regard is the overhead over the wireless link



Saifullah and Faccin                                            [Page 3]





INTERNET-DRAFT        CRAPS Issues and Requirements         23 June 2000


   due to the IP header, which is particularly significant for service such 
   as voice. This problem is being solved by developing header compression
   schemes, e.g. [2].

   It is important for the CRAPS WG to select header compression schemes
   which can sustain the air interface characteristics of errors and
   packet loss.  The scheme should also be spectrum efficient during the
   handoffs.

3.6.  User Identity and Location Protection

   In a session initiation, there is a period during which the MT has  
   identified itself with the network but the network has not yet verified
   the credentails received from the MT, and for this reason no security
   mechanism can be applied to protect the exchange of information between
   the MT and the network. In that period, the MT has to identify itself
   to the network with its subscriber identity using a message in clear. A
   third-party could at this stage listen to this identity and can find out
   where a subscriber is at this particular moment, thus breaching the
   location confidentiality that is a well known requirement for cellular
   networks. In the existing cellular systems, the MT hides its real
   identity by using a temporary identity provided by the network during
   previous interactions. Moreover, during roaming and handovers, the
   location of an MT is kept securely in the network and is not revealed
   to the correspondent nodes.

   The CRAPS WG has to provide mechanisms to ensure user identity and
   location confidentiality over the air interface and to the
   correspondent nodes.


3.7.  A single handover protocol independent of the RF link


3.7.1.  Seamless and Lossless Handoff Procedure

   In cellular network, both seamless and lossless handoff procedures
   are defined. A user may need one or the other based on the service
   being used. A seamless handoff procedure is desired for
   conversational services, where any break in communication or
   degradation of service due to handoffs is perceived as bad quality. 
   A seamless handoff has strict timing requirement for the completion
   of the procedure. On the other hand, a lossless handoff procedure 
   is desired for the services where it is important not to loose any
   data packets during handoff (e.g. data services).

   The CRAPS WG needs to develop a seamless handoff procedure with the
   timing limitations comparable to the existing cellular systems. It



Saifullah and Faccin                                            [Page 4]





INTERNET-DRAFT        CRAPS Issues and Requirements         23 June 2000


   also needs to develop a lossless handoff procedure. The mechanism for
   ensuring no packet loss should be preferably developed at the radio
   specific protocol layers, so the upper layer remains agnostic to the
   handoff.


3.7.2.  Moving of a Session Context

   A handoff procedure moves the current context of the session from the
   source to the target radio network. The context includes parameters
   such as current settings of codecs, encryption, header compression,
   radio frames acknowledged state etc. The target radio network uses
   this information to initialize the relevant functions for the target
   radio bearer. Different RF technologies may have different types of
   context parameters or different possible values of a context
   parameter.

   The CRAPS WG has to harmonize the session context, which need to be
   moved during handoff, between different RF technologies.


3.7.3.  QoS management during HO

   Due to the limited number of radio resources and support of bandwidth
   hungry services, it may not be possible to maintain the same QoS
   level, which was assigned originally for the session, after
   handoff.  There is a need to have a QoS management function, which
   will ensure that the QoS is within the user expectation after
   handoff. The function will also ensure that any QoS degradation
   during a handoff does not adversely effect the network performances
   or the user data flow.



3.7.4.  Addressing before and after Handoff

   The CRAPS WG has to resolve how the IP addressing of a MT will be
   handled during handoffs. After a handoff, it is necessary to determine
   if a new address needs to be assigned or if the the same address can
   be kept. If a new address needs to be assigned, then it is necessary 
   to determine if the time needed to assign the address is short enough
   and the signaling efficient enough to meet the requirements for both
   the handoff timing and the signaling efficiency over the air interface.
   If an old address can be used, then it is necessary to determine how
   re-routing of traffic flows to the new location takes place after
   handoff.

INTERNET-DRAFT        CRAPS Issues and Requirements         23 June 2000


3.8.  Soft Handoff

   The CDMA radio access networks consists of a RAN gateway connected to
   one or more base stations. The RAN gateway has a frame
   selection/distribution function, which combines/splits radio frames
   in executing soft handoff between base stations. A strict
   synchronization is needed between the base stations for the execution
   of soft handoff. A detailed discussion on this topic can be found in
   [3].

   The issues for CRAPS are to determine the location of frame
   selection/distribution function in the absence of a RAN gateway, how
   to replace radio frames between BS and frame selection/distribution
   function with IP packets, and how to keep synchronization between BS
   with an open IP transport.


4.  Requirements for CRAPS

   The following is a list of requirements:

   1. CRAPS shall provide mechanisms for Congestion Control and Load
   Balancing, for increasing the call success rate by utilizing the
   available radio resources among different base stations.

   2. CRAPS shall define the concept of paging area and a mechanism for
   paging area management within the network.

   3. CRAPS shall devise a location determination procedure, without any
   centralized entity performing such function. The location determination
   procedure shall also be independent of the RF technologies.

   4. CRAPS must consider efficient use of radio resources. The call
   block rate due to the unavailability of radio resources must not be
   higher than in the existing cellular systems.

   5. CRAPS shall use a robust and efficient header compression scheme.
   The scheme shall have consistent performance during handoffs.

   6. CRAPS shall provide location confidentiality by protecting the user 
   identity over the air interface and not revealing to the correspondent 
   nodes the location of the node.

   7. CRAPS shall provide both seamless and lossless handoff procedures,
   selectable on a service basis.

   8. CRAPS shall provide a mechanism for the session context relocation
   from the source to the target BS during handoff, independent of the

   RF technologies of the BSs.

   9. CRAPS shall provide a QoS Management function to manage QoS during
   handoff.

   10. CRAPS shall provide an addressing mechanism, which does not
   increase the handoff latency and also does not require any special
   routers in the network.

   11. CRAPS shall determine the location of the frame
   selection/distribution function for soft handoffs.

   12. For soft handoff, CRAPS shall determine how to replace radio
