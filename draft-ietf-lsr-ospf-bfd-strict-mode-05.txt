Abstract

   This document specifies the extensions to OSPF that enable an OSPF
   router to signal the requirement for a Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection (BFD) session prior to adjacency formation.  Link-Local
   Signaling (LLS) is used to advertise the requirement for strict-mode
   BFD session establishment for an OSPF adjacency.  If both OSPF
   neighbors advertise the BFD strict-mode, adjacency formation will be
   blocked until a BFD session has been successfully established.

1.  Introduction

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] enables routers to
   monitor data-plane connectivity and to detect faults in the
   bidirectional path between them.  BFD is leveraged by routing
   protocols like OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340] to detect
   connectivity failures for established adjacencies faster than the
   OSPF hello dead timer detection and trigger rerouting of traffic
   around the failure.  The use of BFD for monitoring routing protocols
   adjacencies is described in [RFC5882].

   When BFD monitoring is enabled for OSPF adjacencies, the BFD session
   is bootstrapped based on the neighbor address information discovered
   by the exchange of OSPF Hello packets.  Faults in the bidirectional
   forwarding detected via BFD then result in the OSPF adjacency being
   brought down.  A degraded or poor quality link may result in
   intermittent packet drops.  In such scenarios, sometimes, an OSPF
   adjacency may still get established over such a link but given the
   more aggressive monitoring intervals supported by BFD, a BFD session
   may not get established and/or may flap over it.  The traffic that
   gets forwarded over such a link would experience packet drops and the
   failure of the BFD session establishment would not enable fast

   routing convergence.  OSPF adjaceny flaps may occur over such links
   as OSPF brings up the adjacency only for it to be brought down again
   by BFD.

   To avoid the routing churn associated with these scenarios, it would
   be beneficial to not allow OSPF to establish an adjacency until a BFD
   session is successfully established and has stabilized.  However,
   this would preclude the OSPF operation in an environment where not
   all OSPF routers both support BFD and have it enabled on the link.  A
   solution is to block OSPF adjacency establishment until a BFD session
   is established as long as both neighbors advertise such a
   requirement.  Such a mode of OSPF BFD usage is referred to as
   "strict-mode".  It introduces the signaling support in OSPF to
   achieve the blocking of adjacency formation until BFD session
   establishement as described in section 4.1 of [RFC5882].

   This document specifies the OSPF protocol extensions using Link-Local
   Signaling (LLS) [RFC5613] for a router to indicate to its neighbor
   the willingness to require BFD strict-mode for OSPF adjacency
   establishment.  It also introduces an extension for OSPFv3 Link-Local
   Signalling (LLS) of the interface IPv4 address to be used for the BFD
   session setup when OSPFv3 is used for an IPv4 address-family (AF)
   instance.

   The extensions and procedures for OSPF BFD strict-mode also apply for
   adjacency over virtual links using BFD multi-hop [RFC5883]
   procedures.

   A similar functionality for IS-IS is specified [RFC6213].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  LLS B-bit Flag

   This document defines the B-bit in the LLS Type 1 Extended Options
   and Flags field.  This bit is defined for the LLS block included in
   Hello and Database Description (DD) packets and indicates that BFD is
   enabled on the link and that the router requests OSPF BFD strict-
   mode.  Section 7 describes the position of the B-bit.

   A router MUST include the LLS block with the B-bit set in the LLS
   Type 1 Extended Options and Flags TLV in its Hello and DD packets
   when OSPF BFD strict-mode is enabled on the link.

3.  Local Interface IPv4 Address TLV

   The Local Interface IPv4 Address TLV is an LLS TLV defined for OSPFv3
   IPv4 AF instance [RFC5838] protocol operation.  It has the following
   format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                 Local Interface IPv4 Address                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:

      Type: 21

      Length: 4 octet

      Local Interface IPv4 Address: The primary IPv4 address of the
      local interface.

4.  Procedures

   A router supporting OSPF BFD strict-mode advertises this capability
   through its Hello packets as described in Section 2.  When a router
   supporting OSPF BFD strict-mode discovers a new neighbor router that
   also supports OSPF BFD strict-mode, it will establish a BFD session
   first with that neighbor before bringing up the OSPF adjacency as
   described further in this section.

   This document updates the OSPF neighbor state machine as described in
   [RFC2328].  Specifically, the operations related to the Init state
   are modified as below when OSPF BFD strict-mode is used:

   Init (without OSPF BFD strict-mode)

      In this state, a Hello packet has recently been received from the
      neighbor.  However, bidirectional communication has not yet been
      established with the neighbor (i.e., the router itself did not
      appear in the neighbor's Hello packet).  All neighbors in this
      state (or higher) are listed in the Hello packets sent from the
      associated interface.

Internet-Draft            OSPF BFD Strict-Mode             February 2022


   Init (with OSPF BFD strict-mode)

      In this state, a Hello packet has recently been received from the
      neighbor.  However, bidirectional communication has not yet been
      established with the neighbor (i.e., the router itself did not
      appear in the neighbor's Hello packet).  BFD session establishment
      with the neighbor is requested, if not already completed (e.g., in
      the event of transition from 2-way state).  Neighbors in Init
      state or higher will be listed in Hello packets associated with
      the interface if they either have a corresponding BFD session
      established or have not advertised OSPF BFD strict-mode in the
      Hello packet LLS Extended Options and Flags.

   Whenever the neighbor state transitions to Down state, the removal of
   the BFD session associated with that neighbor SHOULD be requested by
   OSPF and subsequent BFD session establishment SHOULD similarly be
   requested by OSPF upon transitioning into Init state.  This may
   result in the deletion and creation of the BFD session respectively
   when OSPF is the only client interested in the BFD session with the
   neighbor address.

   An implementation MUST NOT wait for BFD session establishment in Init
   state unless OSPF BFD strict-mode is enabled on the interface and the
   specific neighbor indicates OSPF BFD strict-mode capability via its
   Hello LLS options.  When BFD is enabled, but OSPF BFD strict-mode has
   not be signaled by both neighbors, an implementation SHOULD start BFD
   session establishment only in 2-Way state or higher state.  This
   makes it possible for an OSPF router to support BFD operation in both
   strict-mode and normal mode across different interfaces or even
   different neighbors on the same multi-access interface.

   Once the OSPF state machine has moved beyond the Init state, any
   change in the B-bit advertised in subsequent Hello packets MUST NOT
   result in any trigger in either the OSPF adjacency or the BFD session
   management (i.e., the B-bit is considered only when in Init state).
   Disabling BFD (or OSPF BFD strict-mode) on an OSPF interface would
   result in it not setting the B-bit in its subsequent Hello LLS
   options.  Disabling OSPF BFD strict-mode has no effect on BFD
   operations and would not result in bringing down of any established
   BFD sessions.  Disabling BFD would result in the BFD session being
   brought down due to Admin reason [RFC5882] and hence would not bring
   down the OSPF adjacency.

   When BFD is enabled on an interface over which we already have an
   existing OSPF adjacency, it would result in the router setting the
   B-bit in its subsequent Hello packets.  If the adjacency is already
   up (i.e., in its terminal state of Full or 2-way with non-DR routers
   on a multi-access interface) with a neighbor that also supports OSPF

Internet-Draft            OSPF BFD Strict-Mode             February 2022


   BFD strict-mode, then an implementation SHOULD NOT bring this
   adjacency down but instead use the OSPF BFD strict-mode only after a
   transition to Init state.  However, if the adjacency is not up, then
   an implementation MAY bring such an adjacency down so it can use the
   OSPF BFD strict-mode for its adjacency establishment.

4.1.  OSPFv3 IPv4 Address-Family Specifics

   Multiple AF support in OSPFv3 [RFC5838] requires the use of an IPv6
   link-local address as the source address for Hello packets even when
   forming adjacencies for IPv4 AF instances.  In most deployments of
   OSPFv3 IPv4 AF, it is required that BFD is used to monitor and verify
   IPv4 data plane connectivity between the routers on the link and,
   hence, the BFD session is setup using IPv4 neighbor addresses.  The
   IPv4 neighbor address on the interface is learned only later in the
   adjacency formation process when the neighbor's Link-LSA is received.
   This results in the setup of the BFD session either after the
   adjacency is established or later in the adjacency formation
   sequence.

   To operate in OSPF BFD strict-mode, it is necessary for an OSPF
   router to learn its neighbor's IPv4 link address during the Init
   state of adjacency formation (ideally when it receives the first
   hello).  The use of the Local Interface IPv4 Address TLV (as defined
   in Section 3) in the LLS block of OSPFv3 Hello packets for IPv4 AF
   instances makes this possible.  Implementations that support for OSPF
   BFD strict-mode for OSPFv3 IPv4 AF instances MUST include the Local
   Interface IPv4 Address TLV in the LLS block of their Hello packets
   whenever the B-bit is also set in the LLS Options and Flags field.  A
   receiver MUST ignore the B-bit (i.e., not operate in strict mode for
   BFD) when the Local Interface IPv4 Address TLV is not present in
   OSPFv3 Hello messages for IPv4 AF OSPFv3 instances.

4.2.  Graceful Restart Considerations

   An implementation needs to handle scenarios where both graceful
   restart (GR) and the OSPF BFD strict-mode are deployed together.  The
   GR aspects discussed in [RFC5882] also apply with OSPF BFD strict-
   mode.  Additionally, in OSPF BFD strict-mode, since the OSPF
   adjacency formation is delayed until the BFD session establishment,
   the resultant delay in adjacency formation may affect or break the
   GR-based recovery.  In such cases, it is RECOMMENDED that the GR
   timers are set such that they provide sufficient time to allow for
   normal BFD session establishment delays.

Internet-Draft            OSPF BFD Strict-Mode             February 2022


5.  Operations & Management Considerations

   An implementation SHOULD report the BFD session status along with the
   OSPF Init adjacency state when OSPF BFD strict-mode is enabled and
   support logging operations on neighbor state transitions that include
   the BFD events.  This allows an operator to detect scenarios where an
   OSPF adjacency may be stuck waiting for BFD session establishment.

   In network deployments with noisy or degraded links with intermittent
   packet loss, BFD sessions may flap resulting in OSPF adjacency flaps.
   This in turn may cause routing churn.  The use of OSPF BFD strict-
   mode along with mechanisms such as hold-down (a delay in the initial
   OSPF adjacency bringup following BFD session establishment) and/or
   dampening (a delay in the OSPF adjacency bringup following failure
   detected by BFD) may help reduce the frequency of adjacency flaps and
   therefore reduce the associated routing churn.  The details of these
   mechanisms are outside the scope of this document.

6.  Backward Compatibility

   An implementation MUST support OSPF adjacency formation and
   operations with a neighbor router that does not advertise the OSPF
   BFD strict-mode capability - both when that neighbor router does not
   support BFD and when it does support BFD but does not signal the OSPF
   BFD strict-mode as described in this document.  Implementations MAY
   provide a local configuration option to specifically enable BFD
   operation in OSPF BFD strict-mode only.  In this case, an OSPF
   adjacency with a neighbor that does not support OSPF BFD strict-mode
   would not be established successfully.  Implementations MAY provide a
   local configuration option to enable BFD without the strict-mode
   which results in the router not advertising the B-bit and BFD
   operation being performed in the same way as prior to this
   specification.

   The signaling specified in this document happens at a link-local
   level between routers on that link.  A router that does not support
   this specification would ignore the B-bit in the LLS block of Hello
   packets from its neighbors and continue to establish BFD sessions, if
   enabled, without delaying the OSPF adjacency formation.  Since a
   router that does not support this specification would not have set
   the B-bit in the LLS block of its own Hello packets, its neighbor
   routers supporting this specification would not use OSPF BFD strict-
   mode with such OSPF routers.  As a result, the behavior would be the
   same as without this specification.  Therefore, there are no backward
   compatibility issues or implementations considerations beyond what is
   specified herein.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification updates Link Local Signaling TLV Identifiers
   registry.

   The following values have been assigned via early allocation:

   o B-bit from "LLS Type 1 Extended Options and Flags" registry at bit
   position 0x00000010.

   o Type 21 - Local Interface IPv4 Address TLV

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for "OSPF Link-Local Signaling" [RFC5613]
   also apply to the extension described in this document.
   Inappropriate use of the B-bit in the LLS block of an OSPF hello
   message could prevent an OSPF adjacency from forming or lead to
   failure to detect bidirectional forwarding failures.  If
   authentication is being used in the OSPF routing domain
   [RFC5709][RFC7474], then the Cryptographic Authentication TLV
   [RFC5613] SHOULD also be used to protect the contents of the LLS
   block.
