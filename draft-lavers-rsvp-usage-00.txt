Abstract

   This document presents a number of resource control requirements that
   enterprise network administrators face.  It also discusses how RSVP
   is being used, or considered, in order to address these requirements.

   This document is offered as input to the IETF 77 RSVP mini-BOF.  The
   authors recommend that the IETF continues supporting RSVP as a
   Standards Track protocol and continue facilitating development of
   necessary RSVP extensions in the Standards Track.

1.  Introduction

   Guaranteed QoS for some applications with tight QoS requirements may
   be achieved by reserving resources in each node on the end-to-end
   path.  The main IETF protocol for these resource reservations is
   RSVP, specified in [RFC2205].  The authors of the present document
   recommend that the IETF continues supporting RSVP as a Standards
   Track protocol and continue facilitating development of the necessary
   RSVP extensions in the Standards Track.

2.  Resource Control Requirements and RSVP Usage

   The growth of rich media applications and the evolution of the
   enterprise networks have placed challenging demands in the area of
   resource control.  These challenges and the rationale of why RSVP
   serves these scenarios well are explained in this section.

2.1.  Growth in Rich Media Applications

   There is an increasing use of mixed multi-media (voice, video, and
   data) applications and systems being deployed within the Enterprise.
   In addition, high quality video conferencing is becoming more
   prevalent in todayis enterprises.  While it is clear that the current
   use of DiffServ based QoS is necessary, it is not sufficient in
   addressing the full support of this demands of todayis multi-media
   traffic.  In particular, the voice and video traffic is generally
   provisioned in priority or other fixed-bandwidth queues.  These
   queues require an admission control mechanism without which any
   oversubscription would result in packets being randomly dropped from
   any of the sessions/streams traversing the DiffServ queues.  This
   would lower the quality of the very traffic that we were trying to
   protect and impact user experience.

   RSVP, as defined in [RFC2205], is an on-path explicit signaling
   resource reservation mechanism.  This mechanism not only allows
   admission control based on bandwidth to occur in each of the RSVP-
   enabled hops along the path but it also supports application or user
   based admission control.  This is described in [RFC2208].  RSVP in an
   IntServ architecture also ensures that Resource Reservation mechanism
   is in sync with the QoS applied along the same hop.  Thus it
   addresses the need for the growing rich media application in the
   enterprise.

2.2.  Over-Provisioning not always possible

   While Over-Provisioning may sound theoretically possible, in practice
   it is very difficult to rely on over-provisioning everywhere in the
   network 100% of the time (i.e. during all possible failure scenarios)
   for the following reasons:

   o  It is also not possible to over-provision the Enterprise WAN
      network to match the peak voice and video requirement as the usage
      of rich media applications is not only growing in almost all
      enterprises but is doing so in an unpredictable manner.  Hence, a
      constant adjustment in the network to overprovision is necessary
      but impractical to do so.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Enterprise Usage               March 2010


   o  The cost of over provisioning some links (eg transcontinental) is
      prohibitively high and preclude sheer over provisioning.

   o  There is economical pressure to do right-provisioning and not
      over-provisioning.

   o  The Enterprise WAN network core connectivity is built with
      arbitrary meshing and where the corresponding Diffserv classes
      cannot simply be assumed to be always over-provisioned compared to
      the peak load of voice and video.

   If an enterprise cannot rely on the provisioned capacity to meet all
   their needs then there is a need for an admission control system such
   that the enterprises can handle the over-subscription in a non-
   arbitrary and a proactive manner.  When sufficient capacity is not
   available, RSVP explicitly notifies the application and this allows
   the application to handle the reservation failure in many ways
   including re-routing the traffic through other means, prioritizing
   some traffic over others and issuing a busy tone.

2.3.  Complex WAN/MAN topology

   Due to the complex WAN/MAN topology and the fact that there may be
   Multiple call/session management systems in use, it is difficult to
   depend on a static or off-path bandwidth-counting QoS mechanism.
   These mechanisms do not respond well to real-time network events and
   do not always maintain an accurate representation of the multimedia
   traffic flows originating from multiple systems.

   Enterprise branches sometimes have dual WAN uplinks and where the
   secondary link cannot be over-provisioned.  This scenario is
   challenging to a static or an off-path QoS solution.

   RSVP serves well in this scenario as each of the links can be RSVP
   enabled and the admission control will take into account the capacity
   of the link and the current traffic demands prior to guaranteeing the
   bandwidth for any request.  Thus, complex WAN/MAN topology and/or
   multiple call systems can be deployed in any enterprise without the
   above mentioned concerns.

2.4.  Policy-based Resource Allocation

   Enterprise resources cannot always be over-provisioned to satisfy
   unbounded demand and so resources need to proportioned in accordance
   to business need.  For example, allocate fractions of the link in
   terms of bandwidth to be used by specific applications, application-
   types or user-classes.  This gives rise to a requirement that the
   resource control system should be able to match resources to business

   need in a dynamic and a scalable fashion.

   [RFC2872] and [RFC3181] allow policy elements to accompany
   reservation requests to enable the reservation process to take into
   account business need.  Priority can be attached to reservations
   based on user, user groups, role or other attributes.

   This allows Enterprises to handle unbounded demand nicely.

2.5.  Dynamic Rate Adjustment of Real-Time applications

   As discussed in [I-D.lefaucheur-tsvwg-rsvp-multiple-preemption] and
   [I-D.polk-tsvwg-intserv-multiple-tspec]:

   "Today, real-time applications and endpoints have evolved such that
   they are very often capable of transmitting at different bandwidth
   rates.  This is achieved by various techniques including the use of
   layered coding (and transmission of only a subset of these layers) or
   by reducing frame rates, resolution or quality at a given resolution.
   Endpoints also often have the ability to adjust their transmission
   rate dynamically mid-session with little or no artifact.

   Typically, a higher bandwidth allows to achieve higher quality of
   experience so that it is desirable to take advantage of higher
   bandwidth when available.  However, when only lower bandwidth is
   available, it is desirable that the endpoints adjust their
   transmission rate accordingly, to avoid generating excess traffic
   that is likely to create congestion that will affect even the base
   quality layer of that session as well as the quality of other
   sessions sharing the same network resources.

   When resource reservation is not supported by the network, endpoints
   may be able to achieve such dynamic rate adjustment in a reactive
   manner based on congestion detection.  For example,
   [I-D.westerlund-avt-ecn-for-rtp] discusses how explicit congestion
   notification (ECN) ([RFC3168]) can be used to that effect for RTP
   ([RFC3550]) flows running over UDP/IP that use RTCP () as feedback
   mechanism.

   When resource reservation is supported by the network (e.g.  Using
   RSVP), endpoints can take advantage of it to achieve efficient
   dynamic encoding/bandwidth adjustment.  This can be seen as a pro-
   active approach to dynamic rate adjustment because the network
   facilitates continuous apportionment (and re-apportionment) of
   resources across competing flows before any congestion occurs."

   Extensions such as proposed in
   [I-D.lefaucheur-tsvwg-rsvp-multiple-preemption] and

   [I-D.polk-tsvwg-intserv-multiple-tspec] are necessary to support the
   evolution of applications.

   RSVP is based on explicit on-path signaling and therefore it allows
   upstream systems and applications to take corrective action, such as
   routing the session/stream across a different transport, reducing the
   bandwidth requirement of the session, or allowing the session to
   traverse the transport as Best-Effort traffic.

3.  Recommendation

   Today's enterprises have to address some of the above scenarios and
   because RSVP is well poised to address the same as the main IETF
   protocol for on-path resource reservation, the authors of the present
   document recommend that the IETF continues supporting RSVP as a
   Standards Track protocol and continue facilitating development of the
   necessary RSVP extensions in the Standards Track.  This will ensure
   that on-path resource control solutions can be specified and deployed
   in enterprise networks with the benefits of the full IETF technical
   expertise and with the benefits of multi- vendor interoperability.
