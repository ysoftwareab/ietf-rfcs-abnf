1.  Introduction

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) allows monitoring of Rib-in RFC7854
   [RFC7854], Loc-Rib,BGP local-rib [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-local-rib] and
   Rib-in and Rib-Out monitoring allows pre-policy and post-policy view
   of the prefix.  Thus, for a scaled setup, with all these kinds of
   monitoring enabled, BMP will get a lot of back pressure in the
   protocol as it needs to dump a huge data for its monitored peers,
   through a single socket towards BMP station.  BGP update PDU which is
   part of the BMP Route-monitoring (RM) message is also increasing.  It
   is no more limited to 4K as noted in draft-ietf-idr-bgp-extended-
   messages-21.  Essentially, BMP is heading towards becoming I/O bound
   monitoring protocol.  This document proposes compression of BMP feed
   towards BMP station.  Compression will ease the pressure on TCP
   socket between a router and BMP station.  Such a scheme would be
   useful if a route can spare some extra CPU for BMP operation.

   As it must be obvious, this scheme will require compressor mechanism
   at the BMP speaking router and a decompressor on the BMP station.
   The compression mechanism used at the BMP speaking is an
   implementation specific detail and is beyond the scope of this
   specification.

2.  Procedures

2.1.  Starting Compressor Capability

   BMP compression feature on the router and BMP decompressor feature on
   the BMP station has to be present at the same time.  Enabling
   compression feature at router end only will lead to incomprehensible
   data at the BMP station end.  Also same technique should be used to
   compress and decompress the data on wire.  Using different technique
   to compress and decompress would lead to incomprehensible data at the
   BMP station end.

   BMP compression feature on the router and BMP decompressor feature on
   the BMP station can be enabled via configuraton.  Once this feature
   is enabled between router and BMP station, the monitored router
   should indicate this to the BMP Station using new Compression
   Information TLV as described in following section.

   From that point onwards, the router would send the compressed BMP
   feed towards BMP station.  BMP session needs to be bounced every-time
   this feature is enabled on a current active BMP session.

2.2.  Compression Information TLV

   As noted in RFC7854 [RFC7854], the initiation message provides a
   means for the monitored router to inform the monitoring station of
   its vendor specific details.  It can carry Information TLVs
   containing information about the monitored router.

   The monitored router MUST communicate the compression capability to
   BMP staton using Compression Information TLV described below.

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
     | Information Type (2 octets)   |     Length (2 octets)         |
     +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
     | CM | CMINFO |                Reserved                         |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+


                       Figure 1: Compression Information TLV

   o  Type = TDB1 (2 Octets): Compression Information TLV type.

   o  Length (2 Octets): indicates the length of the value field of the
      Compression Information TLV.  The value field further consists of
      the Compression string.

   o  CM (4 bits): CM indicating DEFLATE compressed format value as
      specified in RFC1950.

   o  CINFO (4 bits): INFO as specified in RFC1950.  Invalid values MUST
      lead to the capability being ignored.  The compressing peer MUST
      use this value for the parametrization of its algorithm.

2.3.  Compressed BMP Messages

   Following rules should be following for achieving BMP feed
   compression:

   1.  A new message type, Compressed Route Monitoring (CRM), MUST be
       used.  This is to ensure backward compatibility with BMP stations
       that do not support the compression capability.  The message type
       is same in structure as described by TLV support for BMP Route
       Monitoring and Peer Down Messages [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv].
       Compression is to be applied only to this message type, all other
       BMP message types shall not be compressed.

   2.  Compression is applicable to all the payload following the Common
       Header, described in Section 4.1 of [RFC7854].  This allows to
       read the total BMP message length, i.e. to perform sanity checks
       against socket and compressor information.

   3.  Each compressed BMP message MUST be sent as a block, i.e. the
       decompression MUST be able to yield decompressed results of the
       without waiting for further compressed updates.  This is
       different from the normally used stream compression mode.

   4.  The compressed message MAY exceed the maximum message size but in
       such case compressor overflow per Section 2.4 MUST be invoked.

2.4.  Compressor Overflow

   This should be handled in same was as described in draft-przygienda-
   idr-compressed-updates [I-D.przygienda-idr-compressed-updates].

2.5.  Error Handling

   If the decompression on the BMP station fails for any reason, it
   needs to bring down the BMP session.

   If the compression on the monitoring router fails for any reason, it
   is at the discretion of the router to handle it.  It may try it few
   more times.  In the worse case it MAY bring down the BMP session

2.6.  Processing of Compressed Route Monitoring messages

   A BMP station receiving a compressed message SHOULD process it as
   follows:

   1.  Decode the BMP Common Header where message length is specified

   2.  Decompress remainder of the Compressed Route Monitoring message
       and determine the decompressed message size from the decompressor

   3.  Decode the BMP Per-peer header

   4.  Decode the BGP UPDATE PDU header to infer the presence of
       trailing TLVs

   5.  Decode the BMP message TLVs

   6.  Decode the actual BGP UPDATE PDU

3.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA assign the following new parameters
   to the BMP parameters name space.

4.1.  BMP Compression Information TLV

   This document defines the BMP Compression Information TLV Header with
   Type = TBD (Section 2.2).

4.2.  BMP Compression Route Monitoring message type

   This document also defines the BMP Compressed Route Monitoring
   message type with Type = TBD (Section 2.3).

5.  Security Considerations

   It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
   considerations.

6.  Normative References
