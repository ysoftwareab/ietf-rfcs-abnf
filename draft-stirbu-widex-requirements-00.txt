Internet-Draft             WIDEX Requirements               October 2005


1.  Introduction

   With the Internet reaching out to more and more devices, people are
   increasingly expecting to have access to services at anytime, from
   anywhere and using any device.  Such services are being developed
   using Web technologies such as XML and distributed across the network
   rather than resident on any one device.


2.  Widex Entities

   The following picture shows the primary Widex entities in a simple
   and basic architecture.

                    +--------+                  +--------+
                    |        | update interface |        |
                    | Widex  |----------------->| Widex  |
                    | Server |<-----------------|Renderer|
                    |        | event interface  |        |
                    +--------+                  +--------+

   The two primary Entities are described as follows:

   Widex Server (WS):
      The entity that holds the application logic.

   Widex Renderer (WR):
      The entity that renders the user interface.

   There might be several Widex Servers in the same device, one for each
   application that can export the user interface and for each Widex
   server there might be several Widex Renderers which are rendering the
   user interface.


3.  Widex Terminology

   The terminology and definitions detailed below include both terms
   that, besides the Widex entities are used in the requirements section
   of this document.

3.1.  User Interface

   In the context of Widex working group, the user interface is
   understood as XML [XML1.0] data describing the user interface.
   Typically, the XML data is manipulated as levels 2 and 3 in the W3C
   Document Object Model (DOM), see [DOM2.Core], [DOM3.Core], and
   [DOM2.Events] (W3C has yet to complete work on DOM3 events).  Style

Internet-Draft             WIDEX Requirements               October 2005


   information associated with the user interface can be manipulated via
   the DOM, see [DOM2.Style].

3.2.  Remote User Interface

   The Remote User Interface (RUI) is a technique in which a user
   interface is rendered on another device than the one that runs the
   application logic while keeping the user interface synchronised with
   the application logic.

3.3.  Remote User Interface Objects

   One of the goals of the Widex working group is to define Remote User
   Interface Objects (RUIO), to be used to convey information about
   interface updates and events.  RUIOs are used to keep the rendered
   user inteface synchronised with the application logic.

   There are three types of RUIOs:

   RUIO Update (RUI.Update):
      RUI.Update messages are sent by the Widex Server in order to
      update XML DOM nodes and associated style properties.

   RUIO Mutation (RUI.Mutation):
      RUI.Mutation messages are sent by the Widex Server in order to
      modify the structure of the XML DOM on the Widex Renderer side,
      e.g. add/remove XML DOM nodes.

   RUIO Event (RUI.Event):
      RUI.Event messages are used to carry events triggered on the Widex
      Renderer side so that they can be caught by the application logic
      event handles on the Widex Server side.  Not all events needs to
      be forwarded to the application logic.  Some events may be
      intended for default event handlers or for local scripted event
      handlers.  The application logic in the RUI server may only be
      interested in specific events.

      RUI.Event messages may carry data according to the type of the
      event, e.g. application defined events with structured payloads as
      per [EMMA], which uses XML for annotated interpretations of user
      input.

      It might be possible for the application logic to raise events
      itself which can then be caught by event handlers associated with
      the remote user interface (RUI), see e.g.  [WhatWG.WebApps1.0].

Internet-Draft             WIDEX Requirements               October 2005


3.4.  Transport Protocol

   The Transport Protocol is a protocol that just transports the RUIOs
   as a string of bits, without looking at them.

3.5.  Simple vs. Complex User Interfaces

   Simple User Interface:
      A simple user interface allows the user interface to be
      represented with only one XML DOM object.

   Complex User Interface:
      A complex user interface may include scripted client-side event
      handlers or there can be more than one XML DOM in the user
      interface, e.g. different DOMs for different modalities, but see
      also [sXBL] for the role of shadow DOMs.


4.  Scenarios and Explanatory Discussion

   In this section we introduce short scenarios to illustrate how Widex
   services can be deployed in some environments.

4.1.  Scenario 1: Widex Server and Renderer Located in Internet

   In this scenario both the Server and Rendere are located somewhere in
   the Internet and are globally accessible via public IP addresses
   (and/or FQDN).

                +--------+         _____
                | Widex  |    _,-''     `--.     +--------+
                | Server |---/              `    | Widex  |
                +--------+   \  Internet    ,'---|Renderer|
                              `._        _,'     +--------+
                                 ``-----'

4.2.  Scenario 2: Widex Server Located in Internet

   In this scenario the Server is located somewhere in the Internet, has
   a globally routable, public IP address (and/or FQDN), and the client
   is behind a NAT device.  The access network is a network where
   private IP addresses are used and NAT is required in order to access
   the public network, e.g. a home network, a hotspot.

                            /   Access     `   +--------+

                                ``-----'       +--------+

4.3.  Scenario 3: Widex Renderer and Server in the Same Network

   In this scenario the Server is located behind the same NAT device as
   the Renderer.
                                    +--------+
                                    |  NAT   |
                                    +--------+
                                    ____/
                               _,-''     `--.
                +--------+    /   Home       `   +--------+
                | Widex  |----\     Network  ,'--| Widex  |
                | Server |     `._        _,'    |Renderer|
                +--------+        ``-----'       +--------+

   The network might be managed in which case a centralised service
   discovery and session setup mechanism should be used, or unmanged and
   a peer-to-peer service discovery and session setup mechanism should
   be used.


5.  Requirements

5.1.  Architecture Requirements

   o  The framework MUST be modular, e.g. multiple session setup
      mechanisms may be used.
   o  The synchronisation MUST occur at a fairly loose level that allows
      for a simple approach to propagating changes.
   o  The framework and the synchronisation protocol SHOULD be
      stateless.

Internet-Draft             WIDEX Requirements               October 2005


   o  The framework SHOULD be consistent with the W3C Multimodal
      Architecture, see [MMI.Arch].

5.2.  Discovery and Session Setup Requirements

   o  The service discovery mechanism MUST be able to discover both
      Widex Renderers and Widex Servers.
   o  The service discovery mechanism MUST be able to negotiate the
      capabilities of both Widex Renderers and Widex Servers, e.g.
      supported devices physical characteristics, supported markup
      languages, etc.
   o  The session setup mechanism MUST be able to establish sessions
      from both Widex Renderers and Widex Servers, e.g. remote user
      interface pull and push.

5.3.  Remote UI Objects Requirements

   o  The RUIOs MUST NOT be aware of the semantics of the markup that is
      synchronized.
   o  The RUIOs MUST support client initiated updates.
   o  The RUIOs MUST support server initiated updates.

5.4.  Transport Requirements

   o  The protocol MUST deliver RUIOs regardless of the undelying
      network topology.
   o  The protocol MUST be reliable.
   o  The protocol MUST tolerate limitations in available bandwidth.
   o  The protocol MUST tolerate delays caused by network induced
      latency.
   o  The protocol MUST have support for authentication and secure
      sessions.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   As a means to support remote user interfaces, a number of security
   considerations need to be addressed, including the potential for
   unauthorized access to application services, monitoring of
   interactions by unauthorized third parties, spoofing of application
   services as a means to support phishing attacks, and denial of
   service attacks.
