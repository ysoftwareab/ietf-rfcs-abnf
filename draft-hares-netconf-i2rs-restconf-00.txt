               RESTCONF Changes to Support I2RS Protocol
                draft-hares-netconf-i2rs-restconf-00.txt

Abstract

   This document describes a RETCONF additions to support the Interface
   to Routing system (I2RS) protocol requirements for I2RS protocol
   version 1.  The I2RS protocol is a re-use higher layer protocol which
   defines extensions to other protocols (NETCONF and RESTCONf) and
   extensions to the Yang Data Modeling language.

   The I2RS protocol supports ephemeral state datastores as control
   plane datastores.  Initial versions of this document contain
   descriptions of the ephemeral datastore.  Future versions may move
   this description to NETMOD datastore description documents.

1.  Introduction

   This a proposal for yang additions to support the first version of
   the I2RS protocol.

   The I2RS architecture [RFC7921] defines the I2RS interface "a
   programmatic interface for state transfer in and out of the Internet
   routing system".  The I2RS protocol is a protocol designed to a
   higher level protocol comprised of a set of existing protocols which
   have been extended to work together to support a new interface to the
   routing system.  The I2RS protocol is a "reuse" management protocol
   which creates new management protocols by reusing existing protocols
   and extending these protocols for new uses, and has been designed to
   be implemented in phases [RFC7921].

   The first version of the I2RS protocol is comprised of extensions to
   existing features of NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf].  The data modeling language for the I2RS
   protocol will be Yang [RFC7950] with features and extensions proposed
   in this draft.

   The structure of this document is:

      Section 2 provides definitions for terms in this document.

      Section 3 summarizes the changes to configuration data store,
      NETCONF, RESTCONF, and YANG.

      Section 4 describes the RESTCONF additions to support the I2RS
      protocol.

      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state] specifies the I2RS requirements
      for the ephemeral state.  Section 5 discusses how ephemeral state
      that fulfills these requirements might be implemented in a control
      plane datastore.

2.  Definitions Related to Ephemeral Configuration

   This section reviews definitions from I2RS architecture [RFC7921] and
   NETCONF operational state definitions

   [I-D.nmdsdt-netmod-revised-datastores] before using these to
   construct a definition of the ephemeral data store.

2.1.  Requirements language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  I2RS Definitions

   The I2RS architecture [RFC7921] defines the following terms:

   ephemeral data:   is data which does not persist across a reboot
      (software or hardware) or a power on/off condition.  Ephemeral
      data can be configured data or data recorded from operations of
      the router.  Ephemeral configuration data also has the property
      that a system cannot roll back to a previous ephemeral
      configuration state.  (See [RFC7921] for an architectural
      overview, [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state] for requirements, and
      [I-D.nmdsdt-netmod-revised-datastores] for discussion of how the
      ephemeral datastore as a control plane datastore interacts with
      intended datstore and dynamic configuration protocols to form the
      applied datastore".

   local configuration:   is the data on a routing system which does
      persist across a reboot (software or hardware) and a power on/off
      condition.  Local configuration has the ability to roll back to a
      pervious configuration state.  Local configuration is defined as
      the intended datastore [I-D.nmdsdt-netmod-revised-datastores]
      which is modified by dynamic configuration protocols (such as
      DHCP) and the I2RS ephemeral data store

   dynamic configuration protocols datastore  are configuration
      protocols such as DHCP that interact with the intended datastore
      (which does persist across a reboot (software or hardware) power
      on/off condition), and the I2RS ephemeral state control plane
      datastore.

   operator-applied policy:    is a policy that an operator sets that
      determines how the ephemeral datastore as a control plane data
      store interacts with applied datastore (as defined in
      [I-D.nmdsdt-netmod-revised-datastores]).  This operator policy
      consists of policy knobs that the operator sets to determine how
      the I2RS agent control plane ephemeral state datastore will
      interact with the intended configuration datastor and the dynamic
      configuration protocol datastore.  Three policy knobs could be
      used to implement this policy:

      *  policy knob 1: I2RS Ephemeral control-plane datastore takes
         takes precedence over the intended datastore in the routing
         protocols.

      *  policy knob 2: Updated intended configuration datastore takes
         precedence over the I2RS ephemeral control-plane data store in
         the routing protocols

      *  policy knob 3: Ephemeral control plane datastore takes
         precedence over any other dynamic configuration protocols
         datastore.

   An practical example for three states of the operator-applied policy
   may help the reader understand the concept.  Consider the following
   three desired outcomes with their policy knob states:

   Monitoring Features only   The policy knob settings are:

         Policy knob 1=false,

         policy knob 2=true,

         Policy knob 3=false,

      Action: I2RS protocol software feature is installed, but the
      operator does not want the I2RS ephemarl datastore to take
      precedence (that is be used) on any variables in the applied
      configuration datastore.  This policy set might be valid if I2RS
      is only suppose to monitor data on this node through newly defined
      parameters.

   I2RS Agent Changes win  the policy knob settings would be:

         Policy knob 1=true,

         policy knob 2=false,

         Policy knob 3=false,

      Action: This is the normal case for the I2RS Agent where the
      ephemeral control-plane datastore takes precedence over the
      intended configuration datastore and dynamic configuration
      datastores.  The values from the I2RS ephemearl datastore are used
      rather than the intended configuration datastore and the dynamic
      configuration protocol datastore.  When the ephemeral data is
      removed by the I2RS agent, the dyanmic configuration datastore and
      the intended configuration datastore state is restored, combined
      and passed to the routing protocols for application.

   Just change until next configuration update  the policy knob settings
      would be:

         Policy knob 1=true,

         policy knob 2=true,

         Policy knob 3=false,

      Action: This case can occur if the I2RS Client write to the
      ephemeral control plane data store is only suppose to take
      precedence until the next configuration cycle from a centralized
      system.  Suppose the local configuration is get by the centralized
      system at 11:00pm each night.  The I2RS Client writes temporary
      changes to the routing system via the I2RS agent ephemeral write.
      At 11:00pm, the local configuration update overwrite the
      ephemeral.  The I2RS Agent notifies the I2RS Client which is
      tracking which of the ephemeral changes are being overwritten.

3.  Overview of Changes

   This oveview reviews the following:

   o  What NETCONF [RFC6241] protocol existing features required for
      I2RS protocol and what extension for these extension features that
      are needed for the I2RS protocol version 1,

   o  What RESTCONF [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] protocol existing
      features are required for the I2RS protocol and what extensions
      are needed for I2RS protocol version 1.

   o  An overview of the Yang 1.1 data modeling language[RFC7950]
      features are needed for I2RS protocol version 1.

   o  An overview of the extensions to Yang 1.1 data modeling language
      [RFC7950] that are needed for the I2RS protocol version 1.

3.1.  I2RS protocol requirements

   The requirements for the I2RS protocol are defined in the following
   documents:

   o  I2RS Problem Statement [RFC7920],

   o  I2RS Architecture [RFC7921],

   o  I2RS Traceability [RFC7922],

   o  Publication and Subscription [RFC7923],

   o  I2RS Ephemeral State Requrements, ,
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state]

   o  I2RS Protocol Security Requirements,
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements]

   The Interface to the routing System (I2RS) creates a new capability
   for the routing systems, and with greater capaiblities come a greater
   need for security.  The requirements for a secure environment for
   I2RS is described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-security-environment-reqs].

3.2.  NETCONF Features and Extensions

   The features the I2RS protocol requires are:

   o  NETCONF [RFC6241] with its updates [RFC7803],

   o  Network Access Control Model [RFC6536] with update (draft-bierman-
      netconf-rf6536bis)

   o  Running NETCONF over TLS with mutually X.509 authentication
      [RFC7589]

   o  Keystore Model [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore],

   o  Subscribing to Yang Datastore updates
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push],

      [I-D.ietf-netconf-netconf-event-notifications],

   o  Subscribing to NETCONF Events (updated)
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc5277bis]

   o  Yang Patch Media type [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-patch],

   o  NETCONF/RESTCONF Zero Touch provisioning
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-zerotouch],

   o  TLS Client and Server Models [I-D.ietf-netconf-tls-client-server]

   o  Call Home [I-D.ietf-netconf-call-home],

   o  Module library [RFC7895],

3.3.  RESTCONF features and Extensions

   This protocol strawman utilizes the following existing proposed
   features for NETCONF and RESTCONF

   o  RESTCONF [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf]

   o  Module library [RFC7895],

   o  Publication/Subscription via Push [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push],

   o  Patch [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-patch],

   o  syslog yang module (both [RFC5424] and
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-syslog-model]

3.4.  Assumptions on Data Store Model Melee

   The NETMOD Working Group has been working to create new definitions
   of datastores based on feedback from operators on desiring a split
   between operational state and configuration state.

   This document takes [I-D.nmdsdt-netmod-revised-datastores] as the
   current status of the datastore discussion on configuration state,
   operational state, ephemeral state changes (via I2RS), and routing
   protocol state.  The following things need to be carefully defined in
   this work:

      What is a dynamic configuration protocol (is it I2RS or DHCP)

      What is a control-plane datastore - (ephemeral state only or
      others? )

      How to express the policy knobs that provide preference between
      intended configuration, control plane datstore, and dynamic
      configuration protocols

      How does operational state allow for operational state to be
      defined by ephemeral-only data models, and mixed (ephemeral +
      intended configuration)

   [I-D.nmdsdt-netmod-revised-datastores] is making good progress, but
   these additional details need to be tied down.

6.  RESTCONF protocol extensions for the ephemeral datastore

   capability-name: ephemeral-datastore

6.1.  Overview

   This capability defines the RESTCONF protocol extensions for the
   ephemeral state.  The ephemeral state has the features described in
   the previous section on NETCONF.

6.2.  Dependencies

   The ephemeral capabilities have the following dependencies:

   o  The Yang modules must support the ephemeral state keyword.

   o  The following features must be supported by RESTCONF

      *  Module library [RFC7895],

      *  Publication/Subscription via Push [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push],

      *  Patch [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-patch],

      *  syslog yang module (both [RFC5424] and
         [I-D.ietf-netmod-syslog-model]

6.3.  Capability identifier

   The ephemeral-datastore capability is identified by the following
   capability string: (capability uri)

6.4.  New Operations

   none

6.5.  modification to data resources

   RESTCONF must be able to support the ephemeral datstore as a context
   with its rules as part of the "{+restconf}/data" subtree.  The "edit
   collision" features in RESTCONF must be able to provide notification
   to I2RS read functions or to rpc functions.  The "timestamp" with a
   last modified features must support the traceability function.

   The "Entity Tag" could support saving a client-priority tuple as a
   opaque string, but it is important that that additions be made to
   restore client-priority so it can be compared with strimgs can be
   done to determine the comparison of two I2RS client-priorities.

6.6.  Modification to existing operations

   The current operations in RESTCONF are: OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST,
   PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.  This section describes the modification to
   these exiting operations.

6.6.1.  OPTIONS changes

   The options methods should be augmented by the [RFC7895] information
   that will provide an indication of what ephemeral state exists in a
   data modules, or a data modules sub-modules or nodes.

6.6.2.  HEAD changes

   The HEAD in retrieving the headers of a resources.  It would be
   useful to changes these headers to indicate the datastore a node or
   submodule or module is in (ephemeral or normal), and allow filtering
   on ephemeral nodes or trees, submodules or module.

6.6.3.  GET changes

   GET must be able to read from the URL and a context
   ("?context=ephemeral").  Similarly, it is important the Get be able
   to determine if the context=ephemeral.

6.6.4.  POST changes

   POST must simply be able to create resources in ephemeral datastores
   ("context=ephemeral") and invoke operations defined in ephemeral data
   models.

6.6.5.  PUT changes

   PUT must be able to reference an ephemeral module, sub-module, and
   nodes ("?context=ephemeral").

6.6.6.  PATCH changes

   Plain PATCH must be able to update or create child resources in an
   ephemeral context ("?context=ephemeral") The PATCH for the ephemeral
   state must be change to provide a merge or update of the original
   data only if the client's using the patch has a higher priority than
   an existing datastore's client, or if PATCH requests to create a new
   node, sub-module or module in the datastore.

6.6.7.  DELETE changes

   The phrase "?context=ephemeral" following an element will specify the
   ephemeral data store when deleting an entry.

6.6.8.  Query Parameters

   The query parameters (content, depth, fields, insert, point, start-
   time, stop-time, and with-defaults (report-all, trim, explicit,
   report-all-tagged) must support ephemeral context
   ("?context=ephemeral") described above.

6.7.  Interactions with Notifications

   The ephemeral database must support the ability to publish
   notifications as events and the I2RS clients being able to receiving
   notifications as Event stream.  The event error stream processing
   should support the publication/subscription mechanisms for ephemeral
   state defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push].

6.8.  Interactions with Error Reporting

   The ephemeral database must support in RESTCONF must also support
   passing error information regarding ephemeral data access over to
   RESTCONF equivalent of the and traceability client.

7.  Ephemeral Data (Background)

   Note: This section probably goes with the definition of ephemeral
   state or as its own Draft

   This section provides an overview of the ephemeral data store as a
   control plane datastore and discusses several concepts that
   implementers need to consider and provide feedback on.  The concepts
   include basic ephemeral datastore concepts, I2RS caching of ephemeral
   data, issues for massive data flow, error handling (normal and
   reduced), use of IPFIX or Binary for carrying I2RS ephemeral data,
   and ephemeral state

   This section augments [I-D.nmdsdt-netmod-revised-datastores] to begin
   to discuss how the ephemeral state comtrol-plane datastore might be
   implemented.  The purpose of this section is to gather implementer
   wisdom on the ephemeral datastore into one place.  This section
   discusses:

      Should we support link to IPFIX in I2RS protocol and ephemeral
      state?

      Binary encoding for RESTCONF/NETCONF

      Ephemeral state in DDoS environments.

   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state] describes the requirements for I2RS
   ephemeral state.

   This section augments [I-D.nmdsdt-netmod-revised-datastores] to begin
   to discuss how the ephemeral state comtrol-plane datastore might be
   implemented.  This initial draft refines the general description so
   that early I2RS ephemeral state implementations may progress.

7.1.  Ephemeral Control Plane Datastore

   [I-D.nmdsdt-netmod-revised-datastores] architecture suggests that the
   applied configuration is the combination of intended datastore, the
   dynamic configuration protocols, and the control-plane datastores.
   As described above, there are policy knobs which allow the I2RS Agent
   to handle deciding what specific configuration variables is installed
   in protocols (E.g BGP) or protocol independent functions (RIB or
   Filters).  In addition, the control-plane datastore may store the
   parameters need to provide publication of events, statistics,
   telementry within the ephemeral control-plane datastore.

   The ephemeral data-store may have models which learn operational
   state and augment it by configuration.  For example
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-l3-topology] uploads ospf and isis topology
   information from the routing system and allows configuration of
   additional links or nodes.

   This new architecture is a multiple panes-of-glass model where the
   decision on what value is chosen is based on policy.  The extension
   of this model is that it is possible for two or more of the control-
   plane datastores to be ephemeral.  If this occurs, then the policy
   knobs must define the how the 2+ ephemeral datastores interact with
   each other and the configuration state.

7.2.  Qualities of Ephemeral Datastore

   Note: The requirements for ephemeral state are in:
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state]).

   This section provides a discussion so that implementers writing code
   for these datastores can discuss what needs to be standardized and
   what does not need to be standardized.

   The ephemeral data store has the following general qualities:

   1.  Ephemeral state is not unique to I2RS work.

   2.  The ephemeral datastore is never locked.

   3.  The ephemeral portion of the intended configuration, applied
       state, and derived state does not persist over a reboot,

   4.  an ephemeral node cannot roll-back to its previous value,

   5.  Since ephemeral data store is just data that does not presist
       over a reboot, then in theory any node or group of nodes in a
       YANG data model could be ephemeral.  The YANG data module must
       indicate what portion of the data model (if any) is ephemeral.

       *  A YANG data module could be all ephemeral (e.g.
          [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-data-model]) with no directly associated
          configuration models,

       *  A YANG model could be all ephemeral but associated with a
          configuration model

       *  or a single data node or data tree could be made ephemeral.

   6.  The management protocol (NETCONF/RESTCONF) needs to signal which
       poritons of a data model(node, tree, or data model) are ephemeral
       in the module library [RFC7895].

7.3.  I2RS Agent Caching of Ephemeral Data

   The multiple control-plane datastore model
   [I-D.nmdsdt-netmod-revised-datastores] architecture allows multiple
   datastores which could allow an implementation of caching of
   ephemeral data in the I2RS Agent by having a main and a backup I2RS
   agent.  Early implementations should at least support the single
   ephemeral data model, but MAY support the multiple datastore mode.
   It is important that these early implementations provide feedback for
   standardization on the following:

      the policy knobs needed to make single ephemeral control planes
      datastores function,

      the policy knobs neeed to make multiple ephemeral control plane
      datastores which support caching work.

7.4.  Massive Amounts of Configuration Data

   Large amounts of data can flow from the I2RS agent to the I2RS
   client, or from the I2RS client to the I2RS Agent.  The I2RS client
   may set or query ephemeral configuration in the routing system via
   the I2RS agent and receive operational state, notifications, or
   logging from the I2RS Agent on behalf of the I2RS routing system.
   I2RS Clients can send large amount of ephemeral configuration data to
   the I2RS Agent.  The writes may be done via NETCONF (<edit-config> or
   an rpc function), or via RESTCONF (PUT, PATCH, POST).  Reads can be
   done via NETCONF <get-config> or RESTCONF GET or query.

   The I2RS RIB Data Model [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-data-model] also supports
   the use of rpc to add/delete RIBs, add/delete/update routes, and add/
   delete nexthops.  If the I2RS client does a small to medium number of
   writes to the I2RS ephemeral state in the I2RS Agent in a routing
   system, the full validation that NETCONF or RESTCONF does will be
   able to be done without any reduction in speed to the I2RS high-
   performance system.  For example, if the I2RS RIB Data Model has adds
   a 1000 routes, the I2RS RIB use of rpc to add/delete/update routes
   should be able to provide a high-performance system.  Alternatively
   the NETCONF <edit-config> could update these 1000 routes with a
   write, or the RESTCONF POST, PUT or PATCH should be able to add the
   1000 routes.

   If a large number of ephemeral routes or filters are written (updates
   or new) by the I2RS Client to the ephemeral state in the I2RS agent,
   one of the key issues for a high performance interface is the time it
   takes to validate routes.  Due to this concern, the I2RS architecture
   was design to allow less than the full NETCONF or RESTCONF
   validation.  The concept is that the I2RS routes would be validated
   within the I2RS client and sent via a 99.999% reliable connection.
   In this scenario, the I2RS Agent would trust the validation that the
   I2RS Client did, and the communication of the route additions via the
   network connection.

   An experiment regarding this has been done with the ODL code base
   update of ephemeral routes, but additional experimentation needs to
   be done prior to finalizing this design.  Section 3.4.2 reviews how
   this process might be done, but many open issues exist in
   implementing this "low-validation" interface.  Without additional
   experimentation and prototype code, this type of "low-validation",

7.5.  Write Error handling

   This section reviews I2RS normal error handling and error handling
   for rpc with no validation checks.

7.5.1.  Normal validation checks

   An I2RS agent validates an I2RS client's information by examining the
   following:

   o  message syntax validation,

   o  syntax validation for nodes of data model,

   o  referential checks (leafref checks MUST clauses, and instance
      indentifier),

   o  checks groups of data within a data model or groups of data across
      data models,

   o  write access to data,

   o  if write access and values already exist, if I2RS client write
      access is higher than existing priority.

7.5.1.1.  Reduced Validation (Experimental)

   Can the I2RS protocol allow for reduced error checking?  The need for
   speed in the I2RS protocol insertions in to the I2RS RIB suggest that
   it is worth experimenting for reduced validation in order to obtain
   high levels of throughput.  If NETCONF or RESTCONf streams pre-
   checked routes to the datastore, what happens?  Implementation
   experience is needed to determine the feasibility of this approach.

   This feature may require a operator-applied policy knob swith a "no
   validation" feature

   o  operator-applied policy knob enabling this feature;

   o  rpc in a data model with the yang "ephemeral-validation no-check;"

7.6.  IPFIX for traffic monitoring

   Due to the potentially large data flow the traffic measurment
   statistics generate, these statistics are best handled by publication
   techniques within NETCONF or a separate protocol such as IPFIX.  In
   the future version of the I2RS protocol may desire to support a data

   stream outbound from the I2RS Agent to an I2RS client via the IPFIX
   protocol.

7.7.  Binary encoding of RESTCONF/NETCONF

   The binary encoding of JSON or XML encodnig in RESTCONF or NETCONF
   may provide a better throughput.  Research needs to be done on what
   is the appropriate binary encoding.

7.8.  Ephemeral state in DDoS environments

   I2RS ephemeral state may operate in places where there is a DDoS
   attacks where the network devices are attacked.  Is one attack plane
   the ability to remove all tracing if the I2RS reboots an attack
   vector?

8.  IANA Considerations

   This is a protocol strawman - nothing is going to IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   The security requirements for the I2RS protocol are covered in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements].  The security
   environment the I2RS protocol is covered in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-security-environment-reqs].  Any person implementing
   or deploying the I2RS protocol should consider both security
   requirements.
