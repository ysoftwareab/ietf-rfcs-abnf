1.  Abstract
    
    Interoperability problems have been observed with erroneous
    labelling of paragraph text as Text/Plain, and with various forms of
    'embarrassing line wrap.' (See section 3.)
    
    Attempts to deploy new media types, such as Text/Enriched [RICH] and
    Text/HTML [HTML] have suffered from a lack of backwards
    compatibility and an often hostile user reaction at the receiving
    end.
    
    What is required is a format which is in all significant ways
    Text/Plain, and therefore is quite suitable for display as
    Text/Plain, and yet allows the sender to express to the receiver
    which lines can be considered a logical paragraph, and thus flowed
    (wrapped and joined) as appropriate.
    
    This memo proposes a new parameter to be used with Text/Plain, and,
    in the presence of this parameter, the use of trailing whitespace to
    indicate flowed lines.  This results in an encoding which appears as
    normal Text/Plain in older implementations, since it is in fact
    normal Text/Plain.
    
    
2.  Conventions Used in this Document
    
    The key words 'REQUIRED', 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD
    NOT', and 'MAY' in this document are to be interpreted as described
    in 'Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels'
    [KEYWORDS].
    
    
3.  The Problem
    
    The Text/Plain media type is the lowest common denominator of
    Internet email, with lines of no more than 997 characters (by
    convention usually no more than 80), and where the CRLF sequence
    represents a line break [MIME-IMT].
    
    Text/Plain is usually displayed as preformatted text, often in a
    fixed font.  That is, the characters start at the left margin of the
    display window, and advance to the right until a CRLF sequence is
    seen, at which point a new line is started, again at the left
    margin.  When a line length exceeds the display window, some clients
    will wrap the line, while others invoke a horizontal scroll bar.
    
    Text which meets this description is defined by this memo as
    'fixed'.
    
    Some interoperability problems have been observed with this media
    type:
    


Gellens                 [Page 3]                 Expires September 1999Internet Draft              The Format Parameter              March 1999

3.1.  Paragraph Text
    
    Many modern programs use a proportional-spaced font and CRLF to
    represent paragraph breaks.  Line breaks are 'soft', occurring as
    needed on display.  That is, characters are grouped into a paragraph
    until a CRLF sequence is seen, at which point a new paragraph is
    started.  Each paragraph is displayed, starting at the left margin
    (or paragraph indent), and continuing to the right until a word is
    encountered which does not fit in the remaining display width.  This
    word is displayed at the left margin of the next line.  This
    continues until the paragraph ends (a CRLF is seen).  Extra vertical
    space is left between paragraphs.
    
    Text which meets this description is defined by this memo as
    'flowed'.
    
    Numerous software products erroneously label this media type as
    Text/Plain, resulting in much user discomfort.
    
3.2.  Embarrassing Line Wrap
    
    As Text/Plain messages get quoted in replies or forwarded messages,
    the length of each line gradually increases, resulting in
    'embarrassing line wrap.' This results in text which is at best hard
    to read, and often confuses attributions.
    
    Example:
    
		>>>>>>This is a comment from the first message to show a 
		>quoting example.
		>>>>>This is a comment from the second message to show a 
		>quoting example.
		>>>>This is a comment from the third message.
		>>>This is a comment from the fourth message.
    
    It can be confusing to assign attribution to lines 2 and 4 above.
    
    In addition, as devices with display widths smaller than 80
    characters become more popular, embarrassing line wrap has become
    even more prevalent, even with unquoted text.
    
    Example:
    
		This is paragraph text that is
		meant to be flowed across
		several lines.
		However, the sending mailer is
		converting it to fixed text at
		a width of 72
		characters, which causes it to
		look like this when shown on a
		PDA with only

		30 character lines.
    
3.3.  New Media Types
    
    Attempts to deploy new media types, such as Text/Enriched [RICH] and
    Text/HTML [HTML] have suffered from a lack of backwards
    compatibility and an often hostile user reaction at the receiving
    end.
    
    In particular, Text/Enriched requires that open angle brackets ('<')
    and hard line breaks be doubled, with resulting user unhappiness
    when viewed as Text/Plain.  Text/HTML requires even more alteration
    of text, with a corresponding increase in user complaints.
    
    A proposal to define a new media type to explicitly represent the
    paragraph form suffered from a lack of interoperability with
    currently deployed software.  Some programs treat unknown subtypes
    of TEXT as an attachment.
    
    What is desired is a format which is in all significant ways
    Text/Plain, and therefore is quite suitable for display as
    Text/Plain, and yet allows the sender to express to the receiver
    which lines can be considered a logical paragraph, and thus flowed
    (wrapped and joined) as appropriate.
    
    
4.  The Format Parameter to the Text/Plain Media Type
    
    This document defines a new MIME parameter for use with Text/Plain:
    
        Name:  Format
        Value:  Fixed, Flowed
    
    (Neither the parameter name nor its value are case sensitive.)
    
    If not specified, a value of Fixed is assumed.  The semantics of the
    Fixed value are the usual associated with Text/Plain [MIME-IMT].
    
    A value of Flowed indicates that the definition of flowed text (as
    specified in this memo) was used on generation, and MAY be used on
    reception.
    
    This section discusses flowed text; section 5 provides a formal
    definition.
    
    Because flowed lines are all-but-indistinguishable from fixed lines,
    currently deployed software treats flowed lines as normal Text/Plain
    (which is what they are).  Thus, no interoperability problems are
    expected.
    
    Note that this memo describes an on-the-wire format.  It does not
    address formats for local file storage.


Gellens                 [Page 5]                 Expires September 1999Internet Draft              The Format Parameter              March 1999

4.1.  Generating Format=Flowed
    
    When generating Format=Flowed text, lines SHOULD be shorter than 80
    characters.  As suggested values, any paragraph longer than 79
    characters in total length could be wrapped using lines of 72 or
    fewer characters.  While the specific line length used is a matter
    of aesthetics and preference, longer lines are more likely to
    require rewrapping and to encounter difficulties with older mailers.
    It has been suggested that 66 character lines are the most readable.
    
    When creating flowed text, the generating agent wraps, that is,
    inserts 'soft' line breaks (SP CRLF sequences) as needed.  Soft line
    breaks are added between words.
    
    A generating agent SHOULD:
        1.  Ensure all lines (fixed and flowed) are less than 80 
            characters in length, not counting the CRLF.
        2.  Trim spaces before user-inserted hard line breaks.
        3.  Space-stuff lines which start with a space, 'From ', or 
            '>'.
    
    In order to create messages which do not require space-stuffing, and
    are thus more aesthetically pleasing when viewed as Format=Fixed, a
    generating agent MAY avoid wrapping immediately before '>', 'From ',
    or space.
    
    (See sections 4.4 and 4.5 for more information on space-stuffing and
    quoting, respectively.)
    
    A Format=Flowed message consists of zero or more paragraphs, each
    containing one or more flowed lines followed by one fixed line.  The
    usual case is a series of flowed text lines with blank (empty) fixed
    lines between them.
    
    Any number of fixed lines can appear between paragraphs.
    
    [Quoted-Printable] encoding SHOULD NOT be used with Format=Flowed
    unless absolutely necessary (for example, non-US-ASCII (8-bit)
    characters over a strictly 7-bit transport such as unextended SMTP).
    In particular, a message SHOULD NOT be encoded in Quoted-Printable
    for the sole purpose of protecting the trailing space on flowed
    lines unless the body part is cryptographically signed or encrypted
    (see Section 4.6).
    
    The intent of Format=Flowed is to allow user agents to generate
    flowed text which is non-obnoxious when viewed as pure, raw
    Text/Plain (without any decoding); use of Quoted-Printable hinders
    this and may cause Format=Flowed to be rejected by end users.
    
4.2.  Interpreting Format=Flowed
    



Gellens                 [Page 6]                 Expires September 1999Internet Draft              The Format Parameter              March 1999

    If the first character of a line is a quote mark ('>'), the line is
    considered to be quoted (see section 4.5).  Logically, all quote
    marks are counted and deleted, resulting in a line with a non-zero
    quote depth, and content. (The agent is of course free to display
    the content with quote marks or excerpt bars or anything else.)
    Logically, this test for quoted lines is done before any other tests
    (that is, space-stuffed and flowed).
    
    If the first character of a line is a space, the line has been
    space-stuffed (see section 4.4).  Logically, this leading space is
    deleted before examining the line further (that is, before checking
    for flowed).
    
    If the line ends in one or more spaces, the line is flowed.
    Otherwise it is fixed.
    
    A series of one or more flowed lines followed by one fixed line is
    considered a paragraph, and MAY be flowed (wrapped and unwrapped) as
    appropriate on display and in the construction of new messages (see
    section 4.5).
    
    A line consisting of one or more spaces (after deleting a stuffed
    space) is considered a flowed line.
    
4.3.  Usenet Signature Convention
    
    There is a convention in Usenet news of using '-- ' as the separator
    line between the body and the signature of a message.  When
    generating a Format=Flowed message containing a Usenet-style
    separator before the signature, the separator line is sent as-is.
    This is a special case; an (optionally quoted) line consisting of
    DASH DASH SP is not considered flowed.
    
4.4.  Space-Stuffing
    
    In order to allow for unquoted lines which start with '>', and to
    protect against systems which 'From-munge' in-transit messages
    (modifying any line which starts with 'From ' to '>From '),
    Format=Flowed provides for space-stuffing.
    
    Space-stuffing adds a single space to the start of any line which
    needs protection when the message is generated.  On reception, if
    the first character of a line is a space, it is logically deleted.
    This occurs after the test for a quoted line, and before the test
    for a flowed line.
    
    On generation, unquoted lines which start with '>', and any line
    which starts with a space or 'From ' needs to be space-stuffed.
    Other lines MAY be space-stuffed as desired.
    
    Note that space-stuffing is very similar to dot-stuffing as
    specified in [SMTP].


Gellens                 [Page 7]                 Expires September 1999Internet Draft              The Format Parameter              March 1999

    If a space-stuffed message is received by an agent which handles
    Format=Flowed, the space-stuffing is reversed and thus the message
    appears unchanged.  An agent which is not aware of Format=Flowed
    will of course not undo any space-stuffing, thus Format=Flowed
    messages may appear with a leading space on some lines (those which
    start with a space or a '>' which is not a quote indicator).  Since
    lines which require space-stuffing rarely occur, and the aesthetic
    consequences of unreversed space-stuffing are minimal, this is not
    expected to be a significant problem.
    
4.5.  Quoting
    
    In Format=Flowed, the canonical quote indicator (or quote mark) is
    one or more close angle bracket ('>') characters.  Lines which start
    with the quote indicator are considered quoted.  The number of '>'
    characters at the start of the line specifies the quote depth.
    Flowed lines which are also quoted may require special handling on
    display and when copied to new messages.
    
    When creating quoted flowed lines, each such line starts with the
    quote indicator.
    
    Note that because of space-stuffing, the lines
        >> Exit, Stage Left
    and
        >>Exit, Stage Left
    are semantically identical; both have a quote-depth of two, and a
    content of 'Exit, Stage Left'.
    
    However, the line
        > > Exit, Stage Left
    is different.  It has a quote-depth of one, and a content of
    '> Exit, Stage Left'.
    
    When generating quoted flowed lines, an agent needs to pay attention
    to changes in quote depth.  A sequence of quoted lines of the same
    quote depth SHOULD be encoded as a paragraph, with the last line
    generated as fixed and prior lines generated as flowed.
    
    If a receiving agent wishes to reformat flowed quoted lines (joining
    and/or wrapping them) on display or when generating new messages,
    the lines SHOULD be de-quoted, reformatted, and then re-quoted.  To
    de-quote, the number of close angle brackets in the quote indicator
    at the start of each line is counted.  Consecutive lines with the
    same quoting depth are considered one paragraph and are reformatted
    together.  To re-quote after reformatting, a quote indicator
    containing the same number of close angle brackets originally
    present are prefixed to each line.
    
    On reception, if a change in quoting depth occurs on a flowed line,
    this is an improperly formatted message.  The receiver SHOULD handle
    this error by using the 'quote-depth-wins' rule, which is to ignore


Gellens                 [Page 8]                 Expires September 1999Internet Draft              The Format Parameter              March 1999

    the flowed indicator and treat the line as fixed.  That is, the
    change in quote depth ends the paragraph.
    
    For example, consider the following sequence of lines (using '*' to
    indicate a soft line break, i.e., SP CRLF, and '#' to indicate a
    hard line break, i.e., CRLF):
    
       > Thou villainous ill-breeding spongy dizzy-eyed*
       > reeky elf-skinned pigeon-egg!*     <--- problem ---<
       >> Thou artless swag-bellied milk-livered*
       >> dismal-dreaming idle-headed scut!#
       >>> Thou errant folly-fallen spleeny reeling-ripe*
       >>> unmuzzled ratsbane!#
       >>>> Henceforth, the coding style is to be strictly*
       >>>> enforced, including the use of only upper case.#
       >>>>> I've noticed a lack of adherence to the coding*
       >>>>> styles, of late.#
       >>>>>> Any complaints?#
    
    The second line ends in a soft line break, even though it is the
    last line of the one-deep quote block.  The question then arises as
    to how this line should be interpreted, considering that the next
    line is the first line of the two-deep quote block.
    
    The example text above, when processed according to quote-depth
    wins, results in the first two lines being considered as one quoted,
    flowed section, with a quote depth of 1; the third and fourth lines
    become a quoted, flowed section, with a quote depth of 2.
    
    A generating agent SHOULD NOT create this situation; a receiving
    agent SHOULD handle it using quote-depth wins.
    
4.6.  Digital Signatures and Encryption
    
    If a message is digitally signed or encrypted it is important that
    cryptographic processing use the on-the-wire Format=Flowed format.
    That is, during generation the message SHOULD be prepared for
    transmission, including addition of soft line breaks,
    space-stuffing, and [Quoted-Printable] encoding (to protect soft
    line breaks) before being digitally signed or encrypted; similarly,
    on receipt the message SHOULD have the signature verified or be
    decrypted before [Quoted-Printable] decoding and removal of stuffed
    spaces, soft line breaks and quote marks, and reflowing.
    
4.7.  Line Analysis Table
    
    Lines contained in a Text/Plain body part with Format=Flowed can be
    analyzed by examining the start and end of the line.  If the line
    starts with the quote indicator, it is quoted.  If the line ends
    with one or more space characters, it is flowed.  This is summarized
    by the following table:
    


Gellens                 [Page 9]                 Expires September 1999Internet Draft              The Format Parameter              March 1999

        Starts          Ends in
        with            One or             Line
        Quote           More Spaces        Type
        ------          -----------        ---------------
        no              no                 unquoted, fixed
        yes             no                 quoted,   fixed
        no              yes                unquoted, flowed
        yes             yes                quoted,   flowed
    
4.8.  Examples
    
    The following example contains three paragraphs:
    
       `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very
       earnestly.
       
       `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so I
       can't take more.'
       
       `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very easy
       to take MORE than nothing.'
    
    This could be encoded as follows (using '*' to indicate a soft line
    break, that is, SP CRLF sequence, and '#' to indicate a hard line
    break, that is, CRLF):
    
       `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very*
       earnestly.#
       #
       `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so* I
       can't take more.'#
       #

5.  ABNF
    
    The constructs used in Text/Plain; Format=Flowed body parts are
    described using [ABNF], including the Core Rules:
    
	paragraph     = 1*flowed-line fixed-line
	fixed-line    = fixed / sig-sep
	fixed         = [quote] [stuffing] *text-char non-sp CRLF


Gellens                 [Page 10]                 Expires September 1999Internet Draft              The Format Parameter              March 1999

	flowed-line   = flow-qt / flow-unqt
	flow-qt       = quote [stuffing] *text-char 1*SP CRLF
	flow-unqt     = [stuffing] *text-char 1*SP CRLF
	non-empty     = *text-char non-sp
	non-sp        = %x01-09 / %x0B / %x0C / %x0E-1F / %x21-7F
	                   ; any 7-bit US-ASCII character, excluding 
	                     NUL, CR, LF, and SP
	quote         = 1*'>'
	sig-sep       = [quote] '--' SP CRLF
	stuffing      = [SP] ; space-stuffed, added on generation if
	                       needed, deleted on reception
	text-char     = non-sp / SP
    
    
    
6.  Failure Modes
    
6.1.  Trailing White Space Corruption
    
    There are systems in existence which alter trailing whitespace on
    messages which pass through them.  Such systems may strip, or in
    rarer cases, add trailing whitespace, in violation of RFC 821 [SMTP]
    section 4.5.2.
    
    Stripping trailing whitespace has the effect of converting flowed
    lines to fixed lines, which results in a message no worse than if
    Format=Flowed had not been used.
    
    Adding trailing whitespace to a Format=Flowed message may result in
    a malformed display or reply.
    
    Since most systems which add trailing white space do so to create a
    line which fills an internal record format, the result is almost
    always a line which contains an even number of characters (counting
    the added trailing white space).
    
    One possible avoidance, therefore, would be to define Format=Flowed
    lines to use either one or two trailing space characters to indicate
    a flowed line, such that the total line length is odd.  However,
    considering the scarcity of such systems today, it is not worth the
    added complexity.
    
    
7.  Security Considerations
    
    This parameter introduces no security considerations beyond those
    which apply to Text/Plain.
    
    Section 4.6 discusses the interaction between Format=Flowed and
    digital signatures or encryption.

8.  IANA Considerations
    
    IANA is requested to add a reference to this specification in the
    Text/Plain Media Type registration.
    
    
9.  Internationalization Considerations
    
    The line wrap and quoting specifications of Format=Flowed may not be
    suitable for certain charsets, such as for Arabic and Hebrew
    characters that read from right to left.  Care should be taken in
    applying format=flowed in these cases, as format=fixed combined with
    quoted-printable encoding may be more suitable.
