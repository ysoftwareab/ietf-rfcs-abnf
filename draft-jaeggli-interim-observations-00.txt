Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title               October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The genesis of this draft was the experience of planning and
   participating in the so called IETF LIM (Large Interim Meeting) held
   adjacent to the fall RIPE meeting on the 29th of September 2012.
   Three working groups met, OPSEC, V6OPS and SIDR.  It is intended that
   the draft cover plannning, at the meeting, and an attempt at some
   conclusions based on the experience.

   The fact that the draft represents the vantage point of a single
   person at this time necessarily limits the scope of the draft and
   undoubtedly as result some key elements of the planning and
   motivation will be missed.  The Large Interim Meeting is the product
   of efforts over a number of years by multiple parties including the
   ISOC Board, IETF management (Chair, IESG, IAB, IAOC, IAD) working
   group chairs and probably others.  To the extent that this draft can
   be made better through the input of others I would invite
   contributions and criticism.
