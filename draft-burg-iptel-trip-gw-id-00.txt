                   Gateway Identification for TRIP_GW

                                 Abstract


   This contribution has proposed that an identification of the gateway
   needs to be provided. The identification of a gateway is required in
   many circumstances especially in the VPN environment.

   Internet Draft            TRIP-GW ID           February 22, 2002




1. Introduction

   Currently, the TRIP-GW proposal [2] is being taken as the IPTEL WG
   work item. In this proposal, it is seen that a new identification is
   needed. This identification can be termed as the site identification
   of the gateway.



2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [3].


3. Proposal

   The current Internet Draft for TRIP-GW [2] assumes that a Gateway
   has full knowledge of the full E.164 numbers and serving carriers
   for which it provides service. This works well for gateways
   interfacing to the PSTN, as discussed in 4.1 of [2] and may also
   work for gateways on customer premise that may be part of a VPN.

   In the latter case, however, the gateway may only know the last four
   or so digits of a private numbering plan and not the higher order
   digits (e.g., country code, etc.). To satisfy the current
   requirements of TRIP-GW in reporting full E.164 numbers, the gateway
   would need to have this additional higher-order information (i.e, be
   able to perform number normilization). There is also a requirement
   to have the same generic dial-plan on all premise gateways and do
   number normalization at the location server or controller. That is,
   gateways need to be able to report a number such as 6789 to a
   location server, where 6789 from VPN-A is distinguishable from 6789
   from VPN-B.

   As a result, there is a need in TRIP-GW to address the needs of
   gateways that are part of a VPN environment. One specific need would
   be to identify the location of the gateway - a Site ID. This is
   different than the Carrier Identification Code (CIC), which really
   identifies public carriers and should not be used in the above way.
   The proposed Site ID is similar to how the H.323 ID is used today.

   There are other VPN attributes that would be useful to specify in
   TRIP-GW - some for reporting purposes.

   Therefore, it is proposed to add an attribute along the lines of
   other "family attributes" currently specified in TRIP-GW. This could
   be a "Premise Identification Family". It would have a status of

   Mandatory: False since, clearly, it would not be used for gateways
   facing the PSTN. With such an addition, it is believed that the
   current draft of TRIP-GW should advance as proposed.



4. Conclusion

   We have shown why a gateway needs to be provided its identification.
   At present, the TRIP-GW [2] proposal does not have it. We have
   proposed that a site/gateway identification needs to be added in the
   proposed draft [2].
