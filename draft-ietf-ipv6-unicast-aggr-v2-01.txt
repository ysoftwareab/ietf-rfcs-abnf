Abstract

   This document defines the unicast address format for the 2000::/3
   (001 binary) prefix.  The address format defined in this document is
   consistent with RFC2460 "Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6)
   Specification" and RFCXXXX "IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture".

   This documented replaces RFC2374 "An IPv6 Aggregatable Global Unicast
   Address Format".  RFC2374 will become historic.

INTERNET-DRAFT   IPv6 Address Format for 2000::/3 Prefix   February 2003


1.0 Introduction

   This document defines the unicast address format for the 2000::/3
   (001 binary) prefix.  The address format defined in this document is
   consistent with the IPv6 Protocol [IPV6] and the "IPv6 Addressing
   Architecture" [ARCH].  It is designed to facilitate scalable Internet
   routing.

   RFC2374, "An IPv6 Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Format" defined
   a structured allocation structure of global unicast IPv6 addresses
   with named fields (e.g., TLA, NLA, etc.).

   While this approach was originally thought to be a good way to
   allocate IPv6 addresses, subsequent experience and discussion showed
   that it would be better to leave flexibility in the definition of
   IPv6 allocation policies to the Internet Address Registries, in order
   to allow a better balance among the competing requirements.  This is
   consistent with the recommendations made by the IAB and IESG in
   [RFC3177].

   This document removes the defined structure and generalizes the
   fields in the global unicast address format.

   This documented replaces RFC2374, "An IPv6 Aggregatable Global
   Unicast Address Format".  RFC 2374 will become historic.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].


2.0 Address Format

   The general format for IPv6 global unicast addresses as defined in
   "IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture" [ARCH] is as follows:

      |         n bits         |   m bits  |       128-n-m bits         |
      +------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+
      | global routing prefix  | subnet ID |       interface ID         |
      +------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+

   where the global routing prefix is a (typically hierarchically-
   structured) value assigned to a site (a cluster of subnets/links),
   the subnet ID is an identifier of a subnet within the site, and the
   interface ID is as defined in section 2.5.1 of [ARCH].

   [ARCH] also requires that all unicast addresses, except those that
   start with binary value 000, have Interface IDs that are 64 bits long

   and to be constructed in Modified EUI-64 format.

   The specific format of global unicast address under the 2000::/3
   prefix is:

      | 3 |     n bits         | 61-n bits |       64 bits              |
      +---+--------------------+-----------+----------------------------+
      |001|  routing prefix    | subnet ID |       interface ID         |
      +---+--------------------+-----------+----------------------------+

   where the routing prefix is a value assigned to a identify a site (a
   cluster of subnets/links), the subnet ID is an identifier of a subnet
   within the site, and the interface ID is in modified EUI-64 format as
   defined in [ARCH].

   infrastructure security.
