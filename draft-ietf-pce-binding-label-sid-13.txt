 Carrying Binding Label/Segment Identifier (SID) in PCE-based Networks.
                  draft-ietf-pce-binding-label-sid-13

Abstract

   In order to provide greater scalability, network confidentiality, and
   service independence, Segment Routing (SR) utilizes a Binding Segment
   Identifier (SID) (called BSID) as described in RFC 8402.  It is
   possible to associate a BSID to an RSVP-TE-signaled Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Path or an SR Traffic Engineering path.
   The BSID can be used by an upstream node for steering traffic into
   the appropriate TE path to enforce SR policies.  This document
   specifies the concept of binding value, which can be either an MPLS
   label or Segment Identifier.  It further specifies an extension to
   Path Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol(PCEP) for
   reporting the binding value by a Path Computation Client (PCC) to the
   PCE to support PCE-based Traffic Engineering policies.

1.  Introduction

   A Path Computation Element (PCE) can compute Traffic Engineering
   paths (TE paths) through a network where those paths are subject to
   various constraints.  Currently, TE paths are set up using either the
   RSVP-TE signaling protocol or Segment Routing (SR).  We refer to such
   paths as RSVP-TE paths and SR-TE paths respectively in this document.

   As per [RFC8402] SR allows a head-end node to steer a packet flow
   along a given path via a Segment Routing Policy (SR Policy).  As per
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], an SR Policy is a framework
   that enables the instantiation of an ordered list of segments on a
   node for implementing a source routing policy with a specific intent
   for traffic steering from that node.

   As described in [RFC8402], a Binding Segment Identifier (BSID) is
   bound to a Segment Routing (SR) Policy, instantiation of which may
   involve a list of Segment Identifiers (SIDs).  Any packets received
   with an active segment equal to a BSID are steered onto the bound SR
   Policy.  A BSID may be either a local (SR Local Block (SRLB)) or a
   global (SR Global Block (SRGB)) SID.  As per Section 6.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] a BSID can also be
   associated with any type of interface or tunnel to enable the use of
   a non-SR interface or tunnel as a segment in a SID list.  In this
   document, the term 'binding label/SID' is used to generalize the
   allocation of binding value for both SR and non-SR paths.

   [RFC5440] describes the PCEP for communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE or between a pair of PCEs as per
   [RFC4655].  [RFC8231] specifies extensions to PCEP that allow a PCC
   to delegate its Label Switched Paths (LSPs) to a stateful PCE.  A
   stateful PCE can then update the state of LSPs delegated to it.
   [RFC8281] specifies a mechanism allowing a PCE to dynamically
   instantiate an LSP on a PCC by sending the path and characteristics.
   This document specifies an extension to PCEP to manage the binding of
   label/SID that can be applied to SR, RSVP-TE, and other path setup
   types.

   [RFC8664] provides a mechanism for a PCE (acting as a network
   controller) to instantiate SR-TE paths (candidate paths) for an SR
   Policy onto a head-end node (acting as a PCC) using PCEP.  For more
   information on the SR Policy Architecture, see
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

1.1.  Motivation and Example

   A binding label/SID has local significance to the ingress node of the
   corresponding TE path.  When a stateful PCE is deployed for setting
   up TE paths, a binding label/SID reported from the PCC to the
   stateful PCE is useful for the purpose of enforcing end-to-end TE/SR
   policy.  A sample Data Center (DC) and IP/MPLS WAN use-case is
   illustrated in Figure 1 with a multi-domain PCE.  In the IP/MPLS WAN,
   an SR-TE LSP is set up using the PCE.  The list of SIDs of the SR-TE
   LSP is {A, B, C, D}. The gateway node 1 (which is the PCC) allocates
   a binding SID X and reports it to the PCE.  In the MPLS DC network,
   an end-to-end SR-TE LSP is established.  In order for the access node
   to steer the traffic towards Node-1 and over the SR-TE path in WAN,
   the PCE passes the SID stack {Y, X} where Y is the node SID of the
   gateway node-1 to the access node and X is the BSID.  In the absence
   of the BSID X, the PCE would need to pass the SID stack {Y, A, B, C,
   D} to the access node.  This example also illustrates the additional
   benefit of using the binding label/SID to reduce the number of SIDs
   imposed by the access nodes with a limited forwarding capacity.

              Figure 1: A Sample Use-case of Binding SID

   Using the extension defined in this document, a PCC could report to
   the stateful PCE the binding label/SID it allocated via a Path
   Computation LSP State Report (PCRpt) message.  It is also possible
   for a stateful PCE to request a PCC to allocate a specific binding
   label/SID by sending a Path Computation LSP Update Request (PCUpd)
   message.  If the PCC can successfully allocate the specified binding

   value, it reports the binding value to the PCE.  Otherwise, the PCC
   sends an error message to the PCE indicating the cause of the
   failure.  A local policy or configuration at the PCC SHOULD dictate
   if the binding label/SID needs to be assigned.

1.2.  Summary of the Extension

   To implement the needed changes to PCEP, in this document, we
   introduce a new OPTIONAL TLV that a PCC can use in order to report
   the binding label/SID associated with a TE LSP, or a PCE to request a
   PCC to allocate any or a specific binding label/SID value.  This TLV
   is intended for TE LSPs established using RSVP-TE, SR-TE, or any
   other future method.  In the case of SR-TE LSPs, the TLV can carry a
   binding label (for SR-TE path with MPLS data-plane) or a binding IPv6
   SID (e.g., IPv6 address for SR-TE paths with IPv6 data-plane).
   Throughout this document, the term "binding value" means either an
   MPLS label or a SID.

   As another way to use the extension specified in this document, to
   support the PCE-based central controller [RFC8283] operation where
   the PCE would take responsibility for managing some part of the MPLS
   label space for each of the routers that it controls, the PCE could
   directly make the binding label/SID allocation and inform the PCC.
   See Section 8 for details.

   In addition to specifying a new TLV, this document specifies how and
   when a PCC and PCE can use this TLV, how they can allocate a binding
   label/SID, and associated error handling.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document:

   BSID:  Binding Segment Identifier.

   binding label/SID:  a generic term used for the binding segment for
      both SR and non-SR paths.

4.  Path Binding TLV

   The new optional TLV called "TE-PATH-BINDING TLV" (whose format is
   shown in Figure 2) is defined to carry the binding label/SID for a TE
   path.  This TLV is associated with the LSP object specified in
   [RFC8231].  This TLV can also be carried in the PCEP-ERROR object
   [RFC5440] in case of error.  Multiple instances of TE-PATH-BINDING
   TLVs MAY be present in the LSP and PCEP-ERROR object.  The type of
   this TLV is 55 (early allocated by IANA).  The length is variable.

                       Figure 2: TE-PATH-BINDING TLV

   TE-PATH-BINDING TLV is a generic TLV such that it is able to carry
   binding label/SID (i.e.  MPLS label or SRv6 SID).  It is formatted
   according to the rules specified in [RFC5440].  The value portion of
   the TLV comprises:

   Binding Type (BT): A one-octet field that identifies the type of
   binding included in the TLV.  This document specifies the following
   BT values:

Internet-Draft              Binding Label/SID              February 2022


   *  BT = 0: The binding value is a 20-bit MPLS label value.  The TLV
      is padded to 4-bytes alignment.  The Length MUST be set to 7 (the
      padding is not included in the length, as per [RFC5440]
      Section 7.1) and the first 20 bits are used to encode the MPLS
      label value.

   *  BT = 1: The binding value is a 32-bit MPLS label stack entry as
      per [RFC3032] with Label, TC [RFC5462], S, and TTL values encoded.
      Note that the receiver MAY choose to override TC, S, and TTL
      values according to its local policy.  The Length MUST be set to
      8.

   *  BT = 2: The binding value is an SRv6 SID with the format of a
      16-octet IPv6 address, representing the binding SID for SRv6.  The
      Length MUST be set to 20.

   *  BT = 3: The binding value is a 24 octet field, defined in
      Section 4.1, that contains the SRv6 SID as well as its Behavior
      and Structure.  The Length MUST be set to 28.

   Section 12.1.1 defines the IANA registry used to maintain all these
   binding types as well as any future ones.  Note that multiple TE-
   PATH-BINDING TLVs with same or different Binding Types MAY be present
   for the same LSP.  A PCEP speaker could allocate multiple TE-PATH-
   BINDING TLVs (of the same BT), and use different binding values in
   different domains or use-cases based on a local policy.

   Flags: 1 octet of flags.  The following flag is defined in the new
   registry "TE-PATH-BINDING TLV Flag field" as described in
   Section 12.1.1:

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |R|             |

                              Figure 3: Flags

   where:

   *  R (Removal - 1 bit): When set, the requesting PCEP peer requires
      the removal of the binding value for the LSP.  When unset, the
      PCEP peer indicates that the binding value is added or retained
      for the LSP.  This flag is used in the PCRpt and PCUpd messages.
      It is ignored in other PCEP messages.

   *  The unassigned flags MUST be set to 0 while sending and ignored on
      receipt.

   Reserved: MUST be set to 0 while sending and ignored on receipt.

   Binding Value: A variable-length field, padded with trailing zeros to
   a 4-octet boundary.  When the BT is 0, the 20 bits represent the MPLS
   label.  When the BT is 1, the 32 bits represent the MPLS label stack
   entry as per [RFC3032].  When the BT is 2, the 128 bits represent the
   SRv6 SID.  When the BT is 3, the Binding Value also contains the SRv6
   Endpoint Behavior and SID Structure, defined in Section 4.1.  In this
   document, the TE-PATH-BINDING TLV is considered to be empty if no
   Binding Value is present.  Note that the length of the TLV would be 4
   in such a case.

4.1.  SRv6 Endpoint Behavior and SID Structure

   This section specifies the format of the Binding Value in the TE-
   PATH-BINDING TLV when the BT is set to 3 for the SRv6 Binding SIDs
   [RFC8986].  The format is shown in Figure 4.

             Figure 4: SRv6 Endpoint Behavior and SID Structure

   The Binding Value consists of:

   *  SRv6 Binding SID: 16 octets.  The 128-bit IPv6 address,
      representing the binding SID for SRv6.

   *  Reserved: 2 octets.  It MUST be set to 0 on transmit and ignored
      on receipt.

Internet-Draft              Binding Label/SID              February 2022


   *  Endpoint Behavior: 2 octets.  The Endpoint Behavior code point for
      this SRv6 SID as per the IANA subregistry called "SRv6 Endpoint
      Behaviors", created by [RFC8986].  When the field is set with the
      value 0, the endpoint behavior is considered unknown.

   *  [RFC8986] defines an SRv6 SID as consisting of LOC:FUNCT:ARG,
      where a locator (LOC) is encoded in the L most significant bits of
      the SID, followed by F bits of function (FUNCT) and A bits of
      arguments (ARG).  A locator may be represented as B:N where B is
      the SRv6 SID locator block (IPv6 prefix allocated for SRv6 SIDs by
      the operator) and N is the identifier of the parent node
      instantiating the SID called locator node.  The following fields
      are used to advertise the length of each individual part of the
      SRv6 SID as defined in :

      -  LB Length: 1 octet.  SRv6 SID Locator Block length in bits.

      -  LN Length: 1 octet.  SRv6 SID Locator Node length in bits.

      -  Function Length: 1 octet.  SRv6 SID Function length in bits.

      -  Argument Length: 1 octet.  SRv6 SID Arguments length in bits.

   The total of the locator block, locator node, function, and argument
   lengths MUST be lower or equal to 128 bits.  If this condition is not
   met, the corresponding TE-PATH-BINDING TLV MUST be considered as an
   error.  Also, if the Endpoint Behavior is found to be unknown or
   inconsistent, it is considered an error.  A PCErr message with Error-
   Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error-Value = 37
   ("Invalid SRv6 SID Structure") MUST be sent.

   The SRv6 SID Structure could be used by the PCE for ease of
   operations and monitoring.  For example, this information could be
   used for validation of SRv6 SIDs being instantiated in the network
   and checked for conformance to the SRv6 SID allocation scheme chosen
   by the operator as described in Section 3.2 of [RFC8986].  In the
   future, PCE could also be used for verification and the automation
   for securing the SRv6 domain by provisioning filtering rules at SR
   domain boundaries as described in Section 5 of [RFC8754].  The
   details of these potential applications are outside the scope of this
   document.

5.  Operation

   The binding value is usually allocated by the PCC and reported to a
   PCE via a PCRpt message (see Section 8 where PCE does the
   allocation).  If a PCE does not recognize the TE-PATH-BINDING TLV, it
   would ignore the TLV in accordance with [RFC5440].  If a PCE
   recognizes the TLV but does not support the TLV, it MUST send a PCErr
   with Error-Type = 2 (Capability not supported).

   Multiple TE-PATH-BINDING TLVs are allowed to be present in the same
   LSP object.  This signifies the presence of multiple binding SIDs for
   the given LSP.  In the case of multiple TE-PATH-BINDING TLVs, the
   existing instances of TE-PATH-BINDING TLVs MAY be included in the LSP
   object.  In case of an error condition, the whole message is rejected
   and the resulting PCErr message MAY include the offending TE-PATH-
   BINDING TLV in the PCEP-ERROR object.

   If a PCE recognizes an invalid binding value (e.g., label value from
   the reserved MPLS label space), it MUST send a PCErr message with
   Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error Value =
   2 ("Bad label value") as specified in [RFC8664].

   For SRv6 BSIDs, it is RECOMMENDED to always explicitly specify the
   SRv6 Endpoint Behavior and SID Structure in the TE-PATH-BINDING TLV
   by setting the BT (Binding Type) to 3.  This enables the sender to
   have control of the SRv6 Endpoint Behavior and SID Structure.  A
   sender MAY choose to set the BT to 2, in which case the receiving
   implementation chooses how to interpret the SRv6 Endpoint Behavior
   and SID Structure according to local policy.

   If a PCC wishes to withdraw a previously reported binding value, it
   MUST send a PCRpt message with the specific TE-PATH-BINDING TLV with
   R flag set to 1.  If a PCC wishes to modify a previously reported
   binding, it MUST withdraw the former binding value (with R flag set
   in the former TE-PATH-BINDING TLV) and include a new TE-PATH-BINDING
   TLV containing the new binding value.  Note that other instances of
   TE-PATH-BINDING TLVs that are unchanged MAY also be included.  If the
   unchanged instances are not included, they will remain associated
   with the LSP.

   If a PCE requires a PCC to allocate a (or several) specific binding
   value(s), it may do so by sending a PCUpd or PCInitiate message
   containing a TE-PATH-BINDING TLV(s).  If the value(s) can be
   successfully allocated, the PCC reports the binding value(s) to the
   PCE.  If the PCC considers the binding value specified by the PCE
   invalid, it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = TBD2
   ("Binding label/SID failure") and Error Value = TBD3 ("Invalid SID").
   If the binding value is valid, but the PCC is unable to allocate the



Sivabalan, et al.        Expires 14 August 2022                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              Binding Label/SID              February 2022


   binding value, it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = TBD2
   ("Binding label/SID failure") and Error Value = TBD4 ("Unable to
   allocate the specified binding value").  Note that, in case of an
   error, the PCC rejects the PCUpd or PCInitiate message in its
   entirety and can include the offending TE-PATH-BINDING TLV in the
   PCEP-ERROR object.

   If a PCE wishes to request the withdrawal of a previously reported
   binding value, it MUST send a PCUpd message with the specific TE-
   PATH-BINDING TLV with R flag set to 1.  If a PCE wishes to modify a
   previously requested binding value, it MUST request the withdrawal of
   the former binding value (with R flag set in the former TE-PATH-
   BINDING TLV) and include a new TE-PATH-BINDING TLV containing the new
   binding value.  If a PCC receives a PCUpd message with TE-PATH-
   BINDING TLV where the R flag is set to 1, but either the binding
   value is missing (empty TE-PATH-BINDING TLV) or the binding value is
   incorrect, it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = TBD2
   ("Binding label/SID failure") and Error Value = TBD6 ("Unable to
   remove the binding value").

   In some cases, a stateful PCE may want to request that the PCC
   allocate a binding value of the PCC's own choosing.  It instructs the
   PCC by sending a PCUpd message containing an empty TE-PATH-BINDING
   TLV, i.e., no binding value is specified (bringing the Length field
   of the TLV to 4).  A PCE can also request a PCC to allocate a binding
   value at the time of initiation by sending a PCInitiate message with
   an empty TE-PATH-BINDING TLV.  Only one such instance of empty TE-
   PATH-BINDING TLV, per BT, SHOULD be included in the LSP object and
   others ignored on receipt.  If the PCC is unable to allocate a new
   binding value as per the specified BT, it MUST send a PCErr message
   with Error-Type = TBD2 ("Binding label/SID failure") and Error-Value
   = TBD5 ("Unable to allocate a new binding label/SID").

   As previously noted, if a message contains an invalid TE-PATH-BINDING
   TLV that leads to an error condition, the whole message is rejected
   including any other valid instances of TE-PATH-BINDING TLVs, if any.
   The resulting error message MAY include the offending TE-PATH-BINDING
   TLV in the PCEP-ERROR object.

   If a PCC receives a TE-PATH-BINDING TLV in any message other than
   PCUpd or PCInitiate, it MUST close the corresponding PCEP session
   with the reason "Reception of a malformed PCEP message" (according to
   [RFC5440]).  Similarly, if a PCE receives a TE-PATH-BINDING TLV in
   any message other than a PCRpt or if the TE-PATH-BINDING TLV is
   associated with any object other than an LSP or PCEP-ERROR object,
   the PCE MUST close the corresponding PCEP session with the reason
   "Reception of a malformed PCEP message" (according to [RFC5440]).

Internet-Draft              Binding Label/SID              February 2022


   If a TE-PATH-BINDING TLV is absent in the PCRpt message and no
   binding values were reported before, the PCE MUST assume that the
   corresponding LSP does not have any binding.  Similarly, if TE-PATH-
   BINDING TLV is absent in the PCUpd message and no binding values were
   reported before, the PCC's local policy dictates how the binding
   allocations are made for a given LSP.

   Note that some binding types have similar information but different
   binding value formats.  For example, BT=(2 or 3) is used for the SRv6
   SID and BT=(0 or 1) is used for the MPLS Label.  In case a PCEP
   speaker receives multiple TE-PATH-BINDING TLVs with the same SRv6 SID
   or MPLS Label but different BT values, it MUST send a PCErr message
   with Error-Type = TBD2 ("Binding label/SID failure") and Error-Value
   = TBD7 ("Inconsistent binding types").

6.  Binding SID in SR-ERO

   In PCEP messages, LSP route information is carried in the Explicit
   Route Object (ERO), which consists of a sequence of subobjects.
   [RFC8664] defines the "SR-ERO subobject" capable of carrying a SID as
   well as the identity of the node/adjacency (NAI) represented by the
   SID.  The NAI Type (NT) field indicates the type and format of the
   NAI contained in the SR-ERO.  In case of binding SID, the NAI MUST
   NOT be included and NT MUST be set to zero.  [RFC8664] Section 5.2.1
   specifies bit settings and error handling in the case when NT=0.

7.  Binding SID in SRv6-ERO

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] defines the "SRv6-ERO subobject"
   for an SRv6 SID.  Similarly to SR-ERO (Section 6), the NAI MUST NOT
   be included and the NT MUST be set to zero.  [RFC8664] Section 5.2.1
   specifies bit settings and error handling in the case when NT=0.

8.  PCE Allocation of Binding label/SID

   Section 5 already includes the scenario where a PCE requires a PCC to
   allocate a specified binding value by sending a PCUpd or PCInitiate
   message containing a TE-PATH-BINDING TLV.  This section specifies an
   OPTIONAL feature for the PCE to allocate the binding label/SID of its
   own accord in the case where the PCE also controls the label space of
   the PCC and can make the label allocation on its own as described in
   [RFC8283].  Note that the act of requesting a specific binding value
   (Section 5) is different from the act of allocating a binding label/
   SID as described in this section.

   [RFC8283] introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller
   as an extension of the architecture described in [RFC4655] and
   assumes the continued use of PCEP as the protocol used between PCE



Sivabalan, et al.        Expires 14 August 2022                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft              Binding Label/SID              February 2022


   and PCC.  [RFC9050] specifies the procedures and PCEP extensions for
   using the PCE as the central controller.  It assumes that the
   exclusive label range to be used by a PCE is known and set on both
   PCEP peers.  A future extension could add the capability to advertise
   this range via a possible PCEP extension as well (see
   [I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space]).

   When PCECC operations are supported as per [RFC9050], the binding
   label/SID MAY also be allocated by the PCE itself.  Both peers need
   to exchange the PCECC capability as described in [RFC9050] before the
   PCE can allocate the binding label/SID on its own.

   A new P flag in the LSP object [RFC8231] is introduced to indicate
   that the allocation needs to be made by the PCE.  Note that the P
   flag could be used for other types of allocations (such as path
   segments [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-path-segment]) in future.

   *  P (PCE-allocation): If the bit is set to 1, it indicates that the
      PCC requests PCE to make allocations for this LSP.  The TE-PATH-
      BINDING TLV in the LSP object identifies that the allocation is
      for a binding label/SID.  A PCC MUST set this bit to 1 and include
      a TE-PATH-BINDING TLV in the LSP object if it wishes to request
      for allocation of binding label/SID by the PCE in the PCEP
      message.  A PCE MUST also set this bit to 1 and include a TE-PATH-
      BINDING TLV to indicate that the binding label/SID is allocated by
      PCE and encoded in the PCEP message towards the PCC.  Further, if
      the binding label/SID is allocated by the PCC, the PCE MUST set
      this bit to 0 and follow the procedure described in Section 5.

   Note that -

   *  A PCE could allocate the binding label/SID of its own accord for a
      PCE-initiated or delegated LSP, and inform the PCC in the
      PCInitiate message or PCUpd message by setting P=1 and including
      TE-PATH-BINDING TLV in the LSP object.

   *  To let the PCC allocate the binding label/SID, a PCE MUST set P=0
      and include an empty TE-PATH-BINDING TLV ( i.e., no binding value
      is specified) in the LSP object in PCInitiate/PCUpd message.

   *  To request that the PCE allocate the binding label/SID, a PCC MUST
      set P=1, D=1, and include an empty TE-PATH-BINDING TLV in PCRpt
      message.  The PCE will attempt to allocate it and respond to the
      PCC with PCUpd message including the allocated binding label/SID
      in the TE-PATH-BINDING TLV and P=1, D=1 in the LSP object.  If the
      PCE is unable to allocate, it MUST send a PCErr message with
      Error-Type = TBD2 ("Binding label/SID failure") and Error-Value =
      TBD5 ("Unable to allocate a new binding label/SID").

Internet-Draft              Binding Label/SID              February 2022


   *  If one or both speakers (PCE and PCC) have not indicated support
      and willingness to use the PCEP extensions for the PCECC as per
      [RFC9050] and a PCEP peer receives P=1 in the LSP object, it MUST:

      -  send a PCErr message with Error-Type=19 (Invalid Operation) and
         Error-value=16 (Attempted PCECC operations when PCECC
         capability was not advertised) and

      -  terminate the PCEP session.

   *  A legacy PCEP speaker that does not recognize the P flag in the
      LSP object would ignore it in accordance with [RFC8231].

   It is assumed that the label range to be used by a PCE is known and
   set on both PCEP peers.  The exact mechanism is out of the scope of
   [RFC9050] or this document.  Note that the specific BSID could be
   from the PCE-controlled or the PCC-controlled label space.  The PCE
   can directly allocate the label from the PCE-controlled label space
   using P=1 as described above, whereas the PCE can request the
   allocation of a specific BSID from the PCC-controlled label space
   with P=0 as described in Section 5.

   Note that, the P-Flag in the LSP object SHOULD NOT be set to 1
   without the presence of TE-PATH-BINDING TLV or any other future TLV
   defined for PCE allocation.  On receipt of such an LSP object, the
   P-Flag is ignored.  The presence of TE-PATH-BINDING TLV with P=1
   indicates the allocation is for the binding label/SID.  In the
   future, some other TLV (such as one defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-path-segment]) could also be used alongside P=1 to
   indicate allocation of a different attribute.  A future document
   should not attempt to assign semantics to P=1 without limiting its
   scope that both PCEP peers could agree on.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [RFC5440], [RFC8231],
   [RFC8281], [RFC8664], and [RFC9050] are applicable to this
   specification.  No additional security measure is required.

   As described in [RFC8402] and [RFC8664], SR intrinsically involves an
   entity (whether head-end or a central network controller) controlling
   and instantiating paths in the network without the involvement of
   (other) nodes along those paths.  Binding SIDs are in effect
   shorthand aliases for longer path representations, and the alias
   expansion is in principle known only by the node that acts on it.  In
   this document, the expansion of the alias is shared between PCC and
   PCE, and rogue actions by either PCC or PCE could result in shifting
   or misdirecting traffic in ways that are hard for other nodes to
   detect.  In particular, when a PCE propagates paths of the form {A,
   B, BSID} to other entities, the BSID values are opaque, and a rogue
   PCE can substitute a BSID from a different LSP in such paths to move
   traffic without the recipient of the path knowing the ultimate
   destination.

   The case of BT=3 provides additional opportunities for malfeasance,
   as it purports to convey information about internal SRv6 SID
   structure.  There is no mechanism defined to validate this internal
   structure information, and mischaracterizing the division of bits
   into locator block, locator node, function, and argument can result
   in different interpretation of the bits by PCC and PCE.  Most
   notably, shifting bits into or out of the "argument" is a direct
   vector for affecting processing, but other attacks are also possible.

   Thus, as per [RFC8231], it is RECOMMENDED that these PCEP extensions
   only be activated on authenticated and encrypted sessions across PCEs
   and PCCs belonging to the same administrative authority, using
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8253], as per the recommendations
   and best current practices in BCP195 [RFC7525] (unless explicitly set
   aside in [RFC8253]).

11.  Manageability Considerations

   All manageability requirements and considerations listed in
   [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8664] apply to PCEP protocol extensions
   defined in this document.  In addition, requirements and
   considerations listed in this section apply.

Internet-Draft              Binding Label/SID              February 2022


11.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   A PCC implementation SHOULD allow the operator to configure the
   policy the PCC needs to apply when allocating the binding label/SID.

   If BT is set to 2, the operator needs to have local policy set to
   decide the SID structure and the SRv6 Endpoint Behavior of the BSID.

11.2.  Information and Data Models

   The PCEP YANG module [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] will be extended to
   include policy configuration for binding label/SID allocation.

11.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   The mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

11.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   The mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new
   operation verification requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8664].

11.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   The mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new
   requirements on other protocols.

11.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   The mechanisms defined in [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8664] also
   apply to the PCEP extensions defined in this document.

12.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers"
   registry.  This document requests IANA actions to allocate code
   points for the protocol elements defined in this document.

12.1.  PCEP TLV Type Indicators

   This document defines a new PCEP TLV; IANA is requested to confirm
   the following early allocations from the "PCEP TLV Type Indicators"
   subregistry of the PCEP Numbers registry, as follows:
