Abstract

  This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
  No-Op control which can be used to disable the normal effect of an
  operation.  The control can be used to discover how a server might
  react to a particular update request without updating the directory.

1.  Overview

  It is often desirable to be able to determine if a directory [X.500]
  operation would successful complete or not without having the normal
  effect of the operation take place.  For example, an administrative
  client might want to verify that new user could update their entry
  (and not other entries) without the directory actually being updated.
  The mechanism could be used to build more sophisticated security
  auditing tools.

  This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
  [RFC3377] No-Op control.  The presence of the No-Op control in an
  operation request message disables the normal effect upon the
  directory which operation would otherwise have.  Instead of updating
  the directory and return the normal indication of success, the server
  does not update the directory and indicates so by returning the
  noOperation resultCode (introduced below).

  For example, when the No-Op control is present in a LDAP modify
  operation [RFC2251], the server is do all processing necessary to
  perform the operation without actually updating the directory.  If it
  detects an error during this processing, it returns a non-success
  (other than noOperation) resultCode as it normally would.  Otherwise,
  it returns the noOperation.  In either case, the directory is left
  unchanged.

  This No-Op control is not intended to be to a "effective access"
  mechanism [RFC2820, U12].


1.1.  Terminology

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

  DN stands for Distinguished Name.
  DSA stands for Directory System Agent.
  DSE stands for DSA-specific entry.


2.  No-Op Control

  The No-Op control is an LDAP Control [RFC2251] whose controlType is
  IANA-ASSIGNED-OID, criticality is TRUE, and controlValue is absent.
  Criticality of TRUE is REQUIRED to prevent unintended modification of
  the directory.  There is no corresponding response control.

INTERNET-DRAFT         draft-zeilenga-ldap-noop-03       25 October 2003


  The control is appropriate for LDAP Add, Delete, Modify and ModifyDN
  operations [RFC2251].

  When the control is attached to an LDAP request, the server does all
  normal processing possible for the operation without modification of
  the directory.  That is, when the control is attached to an LDAP
  request, the directory SHALL NOT be updated and the response SHALL NOT
  have a resultCode of success (0).

  A result code other than noOperation (IANA-ASSIGNED-CODE) means that
  the server is not able or willing to complete the processing for the
  reason indicated by the result code.  A result code of noOperation
  (TBD) indicates that the server discovered no reason why the operation
  would fail if submitted without the No-Op control.

  Servers SHOULD indicate their support for this control by providing
  IANA-ASSIGNED-OID as a value of the 'supportedControl' attribute type
  in their root DSE entry.  A server MAY choose to advertise this
  extension only when the client is authorized to use this operation.


3.  Security Considerations

  The No-Op control mechanism allows directory administrators and users
  to verify that access control and other administrative policy controls
  are properly configured.  The mechanism may also lead to the
  development (and deployment) of more effective security auditing
  tools.

  The No-Op control mechanism is believed not to introduce any security
  risks beyond those of the base operation it is attached to.  Security
  considerations for the base operations, as well as general LDAP
  security considerations, are discussed in RFCs comprising the LDAP
  Technical Specification [RFC3377].


4.  IANA Considerations
