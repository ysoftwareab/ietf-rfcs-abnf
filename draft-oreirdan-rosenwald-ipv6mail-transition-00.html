<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#terms" id="terms">Key Terminology</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This section defines the key terms used in this document.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Email</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">Email is a method of exchanging digital messages from an author to one or more recipients. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> Web mail</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">A service which offers web based access to email services which would otherwise be accessed by dedicated email programs running on the device used to access the email.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.3">1.3.</a> Host</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.1">An end user's host, or computer, as used in the context of this document, is intended to refer to a computing device that connects to the Internet. This encompasses devices used by Internet users such as personal computers, including laptops, desktops, and netbooks, as well as mobile phones, smart phones, home gateway devices, and other end user computing devices which are connected or can connect to the public Internet and/or private IP networks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.2">Increasingly, other household systems and devices contain embedded hosts which are connected to or can connect to the public Internet and/or private IP networks. However, these devices may not be under interactive control of the Internet user, such as may be the case with various smart home and smart grid devices.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.4">1.4.</a> SMTP</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.1">As defined in RFC2821</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.5">1.5.</a> POP</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.5.p.1">As defined in RFC1939 and updated by RFCs 1957, 2449 and 6186</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#intro" id="intro">Introduction and Problem Statement</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">With the depletion of IPv4 address space and the transition of Internet infrastructure to IPv6, it is necessary to address the way in which email services can be transitioned from an IPv4 transport to that of IPv6. It is anticipated that IPv4 will continue for a long time as a major transport mechanism for email services of all sorts. There are significant issues to be addressed around the matter of abuse in an IPv6 based environment which have been addressed and largely resolved when operating using IPv4 as a transport mechanism. The successful resolution of abuse issues may well be a key limitation on the transition of email to an IPv6 environment from the point of view of Internet Service providers.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#limitations" id="limitations">Important Notice of Limitations and Scope</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The issues of abuse specific to IPv6 are not yet fully resolved and will need much additional work. The consideration given to abuse issues here should be considered as preliminary and incomplete.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#Phased%20Transition%20model" id="Phased Transition model">A Phased Transition Model</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">It is not reasonable to specify the changes that each and every email system connected to the Internet must undergo in order to achieve the desired transition, as the number of connected systems precludes creating one plan that contains such a level of detail. Further, while there are common scenarios that may be specified for transitioning individual email systems, the specific timeline and mechanisms utilized for a given email system will be unique. Despite these challenges, it is necessary to coordinate expectations on an overall basis so that Internet-wide email services are maintained throughout the transition. This document specifies a three-phase transition plan that includes preparation, transition, and post-transition phases, and delineates the necessary activities within each phase based on the role that an organization plays in the provision and use of email services.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">An important distinction made in this transition plan is identifying the explicit requirement for existing end-site organizations to add IPv6-based connectivity to their email servers during a transition phase. An accelerated adoption of IPv6 for email servers enables new organizations in the post-transition phase to be connected to the Internet only via IPv6 and still have access to the overall set of email servers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">For nearly every organization, the task of IPv6-enabling their email servers is far easier than undertaking an organization-wide adoption of IPv6.  Still, the requirement for existing Internet-connected organizations to add IPv6 connectivity (even to a small number of email systems) will be a significant hurdle and require a level of effort that may not be achievable given the lack of compelling additional benefits to these organizations [RFC1669]. This transition plan presumes that "connectivity is its own reward" [RFC1958] and that there still exists a sufficient level of cooperation among Internet participants to make this evolution possible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">The three proposed phases are: Preparation Phase, Transition Phase, and Post-Transition Phase.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> <a href="#Preparation%20Phase" id="Preparation Phase">Preparation Phase--Present to January 2013</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">In the Preparation Phase, Service Providers pilot test their IPv6 email services, and end-site organizations prepare to provide email services via IPv6-based connectivity while continuing to provide email services via IPv4 connectivity. During the Preparation Phase, the following principles apply:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">PREP1: Service Providers SHOULD offer pilot IPv6-based email service to their Internet customers for outbound sending. IPv6-based email services MAY be provided via IPv6 transition mechanisms (such as those described in [RFC4213], for example) or via native IPv6 network service.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">PREP2: Organizations SHOULD arrange for IPv6-based Internet connectivity for any Internet facing email servers sending or receiving email. Internet-facing email servers in this phase SHOULD use separate service names per [RFC4472] to avoid impact to production IPv4-based services unless the organization supports production IPv6 connectivity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.4">PREP3: Organizations MAY provide IPv6-based email services to internal user communities.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> <a href="#Transition%20Phase" id="Transition Phase">Transition Phase--February 2013 to January 2014</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">In the Transition Phase, Service Providers offer production IPv6 and IPv4 services to their Internet customers.  End-site organizations provide Internet-facing services in a production manner via IPv6- based connectivity in addition to IPv4-based connectivity. During the Transition Phase, the following principles apply:</p>

<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">Domain Authentication will be required and will be utilizing the mechanisms outlined in RFC4871, RFC5585 and RFC5617</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.2">Consideration should be given to a white-list environment for a limited number of email servers which are verified as belonging to authorized sources of email. It is likely that these would be the email servers of large ISPs, well known email senders such as major Email service providers and other verified sources</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.3">Given the scale of the IPv6 address space, the possibility that a connection exhaustion scenario may develop where the number of attempted connections to an individual email service may overwhelm its ability to provide service. This may occur either deliberately as part of an abusive scenario or inadvertently due to misconfiguration.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.4">Common filtering techniques that are critical for early decision making such as real-time blocklists and IP reputation will need to be amended for practical use in an IPv6 environment.   Other reputation keys such as CIDR reputation and domain reputation should be considered.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.12.p.1">Submitting of unauthenticated port 25 mail to outbound IPv6 email servers MUST be prohibited. User authentication MUST be required to allow users to submit email for delivery.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.p.2">In environments where IP reputation is tracked for outbound customers, this is likely to occur for ISPs that do not require authentication for sending email outbound. Consideration will have to be made for tracking reputation per CIDR. CIDR reputation would continue to track reputation at the lowest unit currently maintained which is the customer residence.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.p.3">Public announcement and aggregation of IPv6 addresses into the delegated CIDR blocks will be required for the purpose of identity identification.  CIDR reputation can then be applied to the whole entity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.p.4">Throttling, particularly when off-net sending is allowed, should  be considered.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.p.5">Utilization of 6to4 conversion (modem to server (6) and server to external server (4)) can be an intermediate step as described above.  Utilization of NAT technologies may also obscure the source IP address.  </p>

Abuse issues includes spam, phishing and spoofing of email addresses.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.14">14.</a> Privacy Considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.14.p.1">This document describes at a high level activities that ISPs should be sensitive to, where the collection or communication of PII may be possible. In addition, when performing this transition, ISPs should be careful to protect any PII collected whether deliberately or inadvertently.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.14.p.2">As noted, any sharing of data from the user to the ISP and/or authorized third parties should be done on an opt-in basis. Additionally the ISP and or authorized third parties should clearly state what data will be shared and with whom the data will be shared with.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.14.p.3">Lastly,there my be legal requirements in particular legal jurisdictions concerning how long any subscriber-related or other data is retained, of which an ISP operating in such a jurisdiction should be aware and with which an ISP should comply.</p>
