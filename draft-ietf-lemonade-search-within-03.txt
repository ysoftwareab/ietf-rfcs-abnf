Abstract

   This document describes the WITHIN extension to IMAP SEARCH.  IMAP
   SEARCH returns messages whose internal date is within or outside a
   specified interval.  The mechanism described here, OLDER and YOUNGER,
   differs from SINCE in that the client specifies an interval, rather
   than a date.  We expect WITHIN to be most useful for persistent
   searches from mobile devices.

Conventions Used in this Document

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

   When describing the general syntax, we omit some definitions as RFC
   3501 [2] defines them.

1.  Introduction

   This extension exposes two new search keys, OLDER and YOUNGER, each
   of which takes a non-zero integer argument corresponding to a time
   interval.  The server calculates the time of interest by subtracting
   the time interval presented by the client, and either returning
   messages older or younger than the resultant time and date.

2.  Protocol Operation

   An IMAP4 server that supports the capability described here MUST
   return "WITHIN" as one of the server supported capabilities in the
   CAPABILITY command.

   For both of the OLDER and YOUNGER search keys, the server calculates
   a date and time by subtracting the interval on the current date and
   time of the server.  Servers MUST maintain at least a precision of an
   hour in this calculation.

   The interval specification is in seconds.  The server honors the
   interval request if it has the precision to do so.  If the server
   does not have the precision to honor the interval request, the server
   MUST select the closest precision possible.  For example, if the
   client requests messages that are younger than 4020 (67 minutes), but
   the server only performs searches with hourly accuracy (as mandated
   above), the server performs the search as if the client requested a
   60-minute interval.

   The server then compares the resultant date and time against the
   INTERNALDATE of the message set in question, as specified in IMAP
   [2]).  For OLDER, messages match if the date and time is less recent
   then the INTERNALDATE.  For YOUNGER, messages match if the date and
   time is more recent then the INTERNALDATE.  If the date and time
   matches the INTERNALDATE precisely, both OLDER and YOUNGER will match
   the message.

3.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation.  Elements not defined here can be found in the
   formal syntax of ABNF [1], IMAP [2], and IMAP Extended ABNF [3]

   This document extends RFC 3501 [2] with two new search keys: OLDER
   <interval> and YOUNGER <interval>.
   search-key /= ( "OLDER" | "YOUNGER" ) SP nz-number
                  ; search-key defined in RFC 3501

   C: a1 SEARCH UNSEEN YOUNGER 259200
   S: a1 * SEARCH 4 8 15 16 23 42

   Search for all unseen messages within the past 3 days (72 hours)
   according to the server's current time.

5.  Security Considerations

   The WITHIN extension does not raise any security considerations which
   are not present in the base protocol.  Considerations are the same as
   for IMAP [2].
