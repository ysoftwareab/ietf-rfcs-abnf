              Definition of ROLIE Vulnerability Extension
                   draft-banghart-mile-rolie-vuln-00

Abstract

   This document extends the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information
   Exchange (ROLIE) core to add the information type categories and
   related requirements needed to support Vulnerability use cases.  The
   vulnerability information type is defined as a ROLIE extensions.
   Additional supporting requirements are also defined that describe the
   use of specific formats and link relations pertaining to the new
   information type.

1.  Introduction

   Vulnerability information sharing is one of the main use cases listed
   in RFC8322.  This document provides additional format specific
   requirements to support interoperability and rich metadata of
   vulnerability information shared using ROLIE.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT,"
   "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Definitions for some of the common computer security-related
   terminology used in this document can be found in [RFC4949].

3.  Information-type Extensions

3.1.  The "vulnerability" information type

   The "vulnerability" information type represents any information
   describing or pertaining to a computer security vulnerability.  This
   document uses the definition of vulnerability provided by [RFC4949].
   Provided below is a non-exhaustive list of information that may be
   considered to be of a vulnerability information type.

   o  TODO

   Note again that this list is not exhaustive, any information that in
   is the abstract realm of an vulnerability should be classified under
   this information-type.

4.  Use of the rolie:format element

4.1.  CVE Format

   Todo

4.2.  VDO Format

   Todo

5.  rolie:property Extensions

   This document provides new registrations for valid rolie:property
   names.  These properties provide optional exposure point for valuable
   information in the linked content document.  Exposing this
   information in a rolie:property element means that clients do not
   need to download the linked document to determine if it contains the
   information they are looking for.

5.1.  urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:vuln:ID

   Provides an XML element that can be populated with an identifier from
   the vulnerability document linked to by an atom:content element.
   This value SHOULD be a uniquely identifying value for the document
   linked to in this entry's atom:content element.

6.  Use of the atom:link element

   These sections define requirements for atom:link elements in Entries.
   Note that the requirements are determined by the information type
   that appears in either the Entry or in the parent Feed.

6.1.  Link relations for the 'vulnerability' information-type

   If the category of an Entry is the vulnerability information type,
   then the following requirements MUST be followed for support of
   atom:link elements.

                   +------+-------------+-------------+
                   | Name | Description | Conformance |
                   +------+-------------+-------------+
                   | todo | todo        | todo        |
                   +------+-------------+-------------+

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  information-type registrations

   IANA has added the following entries to the "ROLIE Security Resource
   Information Type Sub-Registry" registry located at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/category/information-type> .

7.1.1.  vulnerability information-type

   The entry is as follows:

      name: vulnerability

      index: TBD

      reference: This document, Section 3.1

7.2.  rolie:property name registrations

   IANA has added the following entries to the "ROLIE URN Parameters"
   registry located in <https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/>.

7.2.1.  property:vulnerability:id

   The entry is as follows:

      name: property:vulnerability:id

      Extension IRI: urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:vulnerability:id

      Reference: This document, section 6.3.1

8.  Security Considerations

   This document implies the use of ROLIE in high-security use cases, as
   such, added care should be taken to fortify and secure ROLIE
   repositories and clients using this extension.  The guidance in the
   ROLIE core specification is strongly recommended, and implementers
   should consider adding additional security measures as they see fit.

   When providing a private workspace for closed sharing, it is
   recommended that the ROLIE repository checks user authorization when
   the user sends a GET request to the service document.  If the user is
   not authorized to send any requests to a given workspace or
   collection, that workspace or collection should be truncated from the
   service document in the response.  In this way the existence of
   unauthorized content remains unknown to potential attackers,
   hopefully reducing attack surface.
