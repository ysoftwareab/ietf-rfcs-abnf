     Path Computation Element communication Protocol extension for
                relationship between LSPs and Attributes
                  draft-dhody-pce-association-attr-02

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path
   computation in support of traffic engineering in networks controlled
   by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS).

   This document defines a mechanism to create associations between a
   set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as configuration
   parameters, policy or behaviours).

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element communication
   Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between
   two PCEs based on the PCE architecture [RFC4655].

   [I-D.minei-pce-association-group] introduces a generic mechanism to
   create a grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define
   associations between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as
   configuration parameters or behaviours) and is equally applicable to
   the active and passive modes of a stateful PCE and a stateless PCE.

   This document specifies a PCEP extension to associate one or more
   LSPs with a set of attributes, which includes, but not limited to -

   o  Configured Parameters

   o  Policies

   o  Behaviour

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   AAG:  Attribute Association Group.

   LSR:  Label Switch Router.

   MPLS:  Multiprotocol Label Switching.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol.

3.  Motivation

   This section discusses in more detail the motivation and use cases
   for such an association including but not limited to -

3.1.  Opaque Identifier

   An opaque identifier may represent attributes such as configured
   parameters or constraints that a PCEP speaker may invoke on a peer.
   Thus a PCEP speaker may only need an opaque identifier to invoke
   these attributes (parameters or constraints) rather than encoding
   them explicitly in each PCEP message.

3.2.  Policy based Constraints

   In the context of policy-enabled path computation [RFC5394], path
   computation policies may be applied at both a PCC and a PCE.
   Consider an Label Switch Router (LSR) with a policy enabled PCC, it
   receives a service request via signaling, including over a Network-
   Network Interface (NNI) or User Network Interface (UNI) reference
   point, or receives a configuration request over a management
   interface to establish a service.  The PCC may also apply user- or
   service-specific policies to decide how the path selection process
   should be constrained, that is, which constraints, diversities,
   optimization criterion, and constraint relaxation strategies should
   be applied in order for the service LSP(s) to have a likelihood to be
   successfully established and provide necessary QoS and resilience
   against network failures.  The user- or service-specific policies
   applied to PCC and are then passed to the PCE along with the Path
   computation request, in the form of constraints [RFC5394].

   PCEP speaker can use the generic mechanism as per
   [I-D.minei-pce-association-group] to associate a set of LSPs with
   policy and its resulting path computation constraints.  This
   simplified the path computation message exchanges.

3.3.  Bundled requests

   In some scenarios(e.g.,the topology example described in Section 4.6
   of [RFC6805]), there is a need to send multiple requests with the
   same constraints and attributes to the PCE.  Currently these requests
   are either sent in a separate path computation request (PCReq)
   messages or bundled together in one (or more) PCReq messages.  In
   either case, the constraints and attributes need to be encoded
   separately for each request even though they are exactly identical.

   If a association is used to identify these constraints and attributes
   shared by multiple requests and grouped together via association
   mechanism, thus simplifying the path computation message exchanges.

4.  Overview

   As per [I-D.minei-pce-association-group], LSPs are associated with
   other LSPs with which they interact by adding them to a common
   association group.  This grouping can then be used to define
   associations between sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and a set
   of attributes (such as configuration parameters or behaviors).  A new
   optional Association Object is defined.  This document uses the same
   association for attributes, called Attribute Association Group (AAG)
   based on the generic Association object.  This document defines a new
   association type called "Attribute Association Type" of value TBD.

Internet-Draft                 ASSOC-ATTR                      July 2015


   An AAG can have one or more LSPs and its associated attributes.  The
   scope and handling of AAG identifier is similar to the generic
   association identifier defined in [I-D.minei-pce-association-group].

   One or more LSP are grouped via a single group identifier as defined
   in [I-D.minei-pce-association-group].  The attributes that may be
   associated with this set of LSPs may either are -

   o  known to the PCEP peers via some external means like
      configuration, policy enforcement etc (can be considered as 'out-
      of-band').  PCEP speaker simply use the AAG identifier in the PCEP
      message and the peer is supposed to be aware of the associated
      attributes.  This is suitable for stateless PCE where the PCEP
      peers should be aware of the association and its significance
      outside of the protocol.

   o  or communicated to the PCEP peer via PCEP itself on first use (can
      be considered as 'in-band').  PCEP speaker creates a new AAG by
      using a new identifier and the associated attributes are
      communicated via TLVs in association object.  This is applicable
      for stateful PCE only.

   Error handling would be taken up in future revision.

   The format of the generic Association object used for AAG is shown in

                   Figure 2: ATTRIBUTE-OBJECT-TLV format

   The type of the TLV is [TBD] and it has a variable length.  The value
   part consist of a PCEP object (including common header [RFC5440]
   identifying the object) that is associated with this AAG.  This TLV
   identifies the attributes associated with this group.  For each
   attribute a separate TLV is used.  Future PCEP message exchanges may
   only carry the AAG.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a new type for association and a new ATTRIBUTE-
   OBJECT-TLV which do not add any new security concerns beyond those
   discussed in [RFC5440], [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and
   [I-D.minei-pce-association-group] in itself.

   Some deployments may find these associations and their implications
   as extra sensitive and thus should employ suitable PCEP security
   mechanisms like TCP-AO or [I-D.ietf-pce-pceps].

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Association object Type Indicators

   This document defines the following new association type originally
   defined in [I-D.minei-pce-association-group].

   Value     Name                        Reference
   TBD       Attribute Association Type  [This I.D.]

7.2.  PCEP TLV Type Indicators

   This document defines the following new PCEP TLV; IANA is requested
   to make the following allocations from this registry.
