Abstract

   This document registers the ENUMservice "voice" (which has a defined
   sub-type "tel"), as per the IANA registration process defined in the
   ENUM specification RFC3761.  This service indicates that the contact
   held in the generated URI can be used to initiate an interactive
   voice (audio) call.

2.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC3761 [2]) is a system that transforms
   E.164 numbers [3] into domain names and then uses DNS (Domain Name
   Service, RFC1034 [4]) features like delegation through NS records,
   and the use of NAPTR records, to look up the communication services
   available for a specific domain name.

   This document registers an Enumservice according to the guidelines
   given in RFC3761 to be used for provisioning in the services field of
   a NAPTR [5] resource record to indicate what class of functionality a
   given end point offers.  The registration is defined within the DDDS
   (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System [6][7] [5][8] [9]) hierarchy,
   for use with the "E2U" DDDS Application defined in RFC3761.

   Enumservices have a type and subtype.  This latter is optional, as it
   may be implicit in the service type.  The type defines the kind of
   communication session that can be initiated using the contact
   indicated by the URI generated by the enclosing NAPTR.  In
   telecommunications engineering terms, it reflects the "teleservice".

   The sub-type defines the subsystem that is to be used to initiate the
   communication session.  Note that the sub-type definition is usually
   associated with the URI scheme that is to be used.

   Both the type and subtype (where present) must be supported for the
   NAPTR to be used by a potential correspondent.

   There are a number of DDDS Applications in addition to ENUM (for
   example, see [8] and [9]).  However, an Enumservice indication
   operates only within the context of the "E2U" (ENUM) DDDS
   Application.

   Whilst the protocol elements that make up ENUM are defined in the
   above documents and in this one, further examples of the use to which
   these may be put are given in other documents, for example in ETSI TS
   102 172 [11].

   This document registers the Enumservice "voice" (which has a defined
   sub-type "tel"), as per the IANA registration process defined in the
   ENUM specification RFC3761.  This service indicates that the contact
   held in the generated URI can be used to initiate an interactive
   voice (audio) call.

3.  Enumservice for Interactive Voice

   The kind of communication indicated by this Enumservice is
   "Interactive Voice".  From a protocol perspective, this communication
   is expected to involve bidirectional media streams carrying audio
   data.

   A client may imply that the person controlling population of a NAPTR
   holding this Enumservice indicates their capability to engage in an
   interactive voice session when contacted using the URI generated by
   this NAPTR.

3.1.  Defined Sub-type "tel" for Interactive Voice

      Sub-type:

         "tel"



      Generated URI scheme:

         "tel:" (defined in RFC3966 [10])


   This sub-type indicates that the person responsible for the NAPTR is
   accessible via the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) or PLMN
   (Public Land Mobile Network) using the value of the generated URI.

   The kind of subsystem required to initiate a Voice Enumservice with
   this sub-type is a "Dialler".  This is a subsystem that either
   provides a local connection to the PSTN or PLMN, or that provides an
   indirect connection to those networks.  The subsystem will use the
   telephone number held in the generated URI to place a voice call.
   The voice call is placed to a network that uses E.164 numbers to
   route calls to an appropriate destination.

   Note that the PSTN/PLMN connection may be indirect.  The end user
   receiving this NAPTR may have a relationship with a Communications
   Service Provider that accepts call initiation requests from that
   subsystem using an IP-based protocol such as SIP or H.323, and places
   the call to the PSTN using a remote gateway service.  In this case
   the Provider may either accept requests using "tel:" URIs or has a
   defined mechanism to convert "tel:" URI values into a "protocol-
   native" form.

   The "tel:" URI value SHOULD be fully qualified (using the "global
   phone number" form of RFC3966).  A "local phone number" as defined in

Internet-Draft     IANA Voice Enumservice Registration    September 2005


   that document SHOULD NOT be used unless the controller of the zone in
   which the NAPTR appears is sure that it can be distinguished
   unambiguously by all clients that can access the resource record and
   that a call from their network access points can be routed to that
   destination.

4.  Security Considerations

   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database.  Thus any
   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously.  Whilst
   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a Telephone
   Directory, it does open the data subject to having "their"
   information collected automatically without any indication that this
   has been done or by whom.

   Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists
   of targets for unrequested information; in short, they are used to
   address "spam".  Anyone who uses a Web-archived mailing list is aware
   that the volume of "spam" email they are sent increases when he or
   she posts to the mailing list; publication of a telephone number in
   ENUM is no different, and may be used for attempts to send "junk
   faxes" or "junk SMS" for example.

   Many mailing list users have more than one email address and use
   "sacrificial" email accounts when posting to such lists to help
   filter out unrequested emails sent to them.  This is not so easy with
   published telephone numbers; the PSTN E.164 number assignment process
   is much more involved and usually a single E.164 number (or a fixed
   range of numbers) is associated with each PSTN access.  Thus
   providing a "sacrificial" phone number in any publication is not
   possible.

   Due to the implications of publishing data on a globally accessible
   database, as a principle the data subject MUST give their explicit
   informed consent to data being published in ENUM.

   In addition, they should be made aware that, due to storage of such
   data during harvesting by third parties, removal of the data from
   publication will not remove any copies that have been taken; in
   effect, any publication may be permanent.

   However, regulations in many regions will require that the data
   subject can at any time request that the data is removed from
   publication, and that their consent for its publication is explicitly
   confirmed at regular intervals.

   When placing a voice call via the PSTN (or from the Public Land
   Mobile Network), the sender may be charged for this action.  In both
   kinds of network, calling some numbers is more expensive than sending
   to others; both kinds of network have "premium rate" services that
   can be charged at a rate considerably more than a "normal" call.  As
   such, it is important that the end user be asked to confirm placing
   the call, and that the destination number be presented to them.  It
   is the originating user's choice on whether or not to place a call to

   this destination number, but they SHOULD be shown the destination
   number so that they can make this decision.

   In addition to the specific security considerations given above, all
   security considerations given in RFC3761 apply, as well as the DNS-
   specific threats covered in RFC3833 [12].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA registers the Enumservice "voice"
   with a single sub-type "tel" according to the framework defined in
   RFC3761.  The current document defines this Enumservice and the
   expected behaviour of clients.
