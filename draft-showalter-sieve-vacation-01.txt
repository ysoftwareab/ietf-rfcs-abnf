Abstract

   This document describes an extension to the Sieve mail filtering
   language for an autoresponder similar to that of the Unix "vacation"
   command for replying to messages with certain safety features to
   prevent problems.

0. Meta-information on this draft

   This information is intended to facilitate discussion.  It will be
   removed when this document leaves the Internet-Draft stage.

0.1. Discussion

   This draft is intended to be an extension to the Sieve mail filtering
   language, avaliable from the Internet-Drafts repository as
   <ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-showalter-sieve-07.txt>
   (where 07 is the version number, which is actually currently 07).

   This draft and the Sieve language itself are being discussed on the
   MTA Filters mailing list at <ietf-mta-filters@imc.org>.  Subscription
   requests can be sent to <ietf-mta-filters-request@imc.org> (send an
   email message with the word "subscribe" in the body).  More
   information on the mailing list along with a WWW archive of back
   messages is available at <http://www.imc.org/ietf-mta-filters/>.

1. Introduction

   This is an extension to the Sieve language defined by [SIEVE] for
   notification that messages will not be immediately answered.

   Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1, including
   use of [KEYWORDS].

2. Capability Identifier

   Sieve implementations that implement vacation have an identifier of
   "vacation" for use with the capability mechanism.

3. Vacation Action

   Syntax:   vacation [":days" number] [":addresses" string-list]
             [":subject" string] <reason: string>

   The "vacation" action implements a vacation autoresponder similar to
   the vacation command  available under many versions of Unix.  Its
   purpose is to provide correspondents with notification that the user
   is away for an extended period of time and that they should not
   expect quick responses.

   "Vacation" is used to respond to a message with another message.
   Vacation's messages are always addressed to the Return-Path address
   (that is, the envelope from address) of the message being responded
   to.

   The ":days" argument is used to specify the period in which addresses
   are kept and are not responded to, and is always specified in days.
   The minimum value used for this parameter is 1.  Sites MAY define a
   different minimum value.  Sites MAY also define a maximum days value,
   which MUST be greater than 7, and SHOULD be greater than 30.

   If ":days" is omitted, the default value is 7, or the minimum value
   (as defined above), whichever is greater.

   If the parameter given to ":days" is greater than the minimum value,
   then the minimum value is used instead.

   If ":days" exceeds the site-defined maximum, the site-defined maximum
   is used instead.

   "Vacation" keeps track of all of the addresses that it has responded
   to in some period (as specified by the :days optional argument).  If
   vacation has not previously responded to this address within that
   time period, it sends the "reason" argument to the Return-Path
   address of the message that is being responded to.

   "Vacation" never responds to a message unless the user's email
   address is in the "To" or "Cc" line of the original message.
   Implementations are assumed to be able to know this information, but
   users may have additional addresses beyond the control of the local
   mail system.

   Users can supply additional mail addresses that are theirs with the
   ":addresses" argument, which takes a string-list listing additional
   addresses that a user might have.

   Users can specify the subject of the reply with the ":subject"
   parameter.  If the :subject parameter is not supplied, then the
   subject is generated as follows: The subject is set to the characters
   "Re: " followed by the original subject with all leading occurrence
   of the characters "Re: " stripped off.

   Replies must have the In-Reply-To field set to the Message-ID of the
   original message.

   Example:
             require "vacation";
             vacation :days 23 :addresses ["tjs@znic.edu", "ts4z@landru.edu"]
                "I'm away until October 19.  If it's an emergency, call
                911, I guess." ;

   By mingling vacation with other rules, users can do something more
   selective.

   Example:
             require "vacation";
             if header :contains "from" "boss@frobnitzm.edu" {
                redirect "pleeb@xanadu.wv.us";
             } else {
                vacation "Sorry, I'm away, I'll read your message
                   when I get around to it.";
             }


4. Interaction with Other Sieve Actions

   Vacation does not affect the implicit keep.

   Vacation may not be used with reject.

5. Security Considerations

   It is critical that implementations correctly implement the
   limitations described above: Replies MUST NOT be sent out in response
   to messages not sent directly to the user, and replies MUST NOT be
   sent out more often than the :days argument states.
