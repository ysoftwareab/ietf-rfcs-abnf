Abstract

   This document contains a MIB module for commonly used transport
   layer addressing information. It defines a registry for identifiers
   that identify protocols and a set of textual conventions for
   representing addresses. This document also establishes IANA as the
   maintainer of this registry. 

   This work is output from the Operations and Management Area
   "IPv6MIB" design team.

Internet-Draft        TCs for Transport Addresses               May 2000


1. Introduction

   This MIB module contains definitions for commonly used transport
   layer addressing information.  In particular, it defines a registry
   of OBJECT-IDENTIFIERs for transport protocols, and a set of textual
   conventions for representing transport layer endpoints. The former
   are intended to be widely used as values for MIB objects whose
   syntax is TDomain [7], the latter as values for MIB objects whose
   syntax is TAddress [7]. 

   The purpose of this memo is to provide a single, well-known
   repository for transport layer address-related information. Further,
   this document establishes the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA) as the maintainer of these definitions (see Section 6). 

   Without such a repository, each MIB module requiring addressing
   constructs is forced to either define its own, or attempt to locate
   and include similar definitions from other modules.  The advantages
   of a repository are 
   1.  there is a single set of definitions 
   2.  all MIB developers know what to include, and where to look 
   3.  multiple definitions of the same information is avoided 
   4.  the definitions are independent and widely usable, not tied to a
       particular protocol, MIB module, or enterprise 
   5.  this module can be updated independently, and hence much more
       rapidly, than if the information is defined in broader RFCs on
       the standards-track (for example, RFC 1906 [11]. 

   This memo also defines a new textual convention IanaTAddressType for
   registering protocols using an enumerated INTEGER base type. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]. 

2. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components: 
   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2]. 
   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, RFC 1155 [3], STD 16, RFC 1212 [4] and RFC 1215 [5]. The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
      [6], STD 58, RFC 2579 [7] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [8]. 
   o  Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9]. A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track

      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [10] and
      RFC 1906 [11]. The third version of the message protocol is
      called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [11], RFC 2572 [12] and
      RFC 2574 [13]. 
   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9]. A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [14]. 
   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [15] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [16]. 
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [17]. 

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of
   the MIB. 

3. Transport Domains and Addresses

   The TDomain and TAddress textual conventions are defined in RFC 2579
   [7], and are intended to be used in MIB modules to represent
   transport domains and addresses. 

   Actual values for object definitions with these syntaxes are
   currently defined in RFC 1906 [11] and various other
   (enterprise-specific) modules.  The transport domains defined in RFC
   1906 [11] all contain "snmp" as the prefix in their name and are
   registered under `snmpDomains' (from RFC 2578 [6]). There has been
   some confusion as to whether these definitions are appropriate for
   designating transport endpoints for non-SNMP traffic.  These
   definitions are also now incomplete, new transport addresses are
   needed currently to support (at least) TCP-over-IPv6, UDP-over-IPv6,
   and Posix Local IPC domain sockets (formerly known as UNIX domain
   sockets). 

   This module defines a new set of generic transport domains and
   addresses.  All assignments are administered by IANA.

   This module does NOT define the transport mappings for any
   particular protocol.  Rather, it defines a set of common identifiers
   and textual conventions that are intended to be used within various
   transport mappings documents. (Inclusion within transport mappings
   documents is just one possible use of these generic definitions.)

5. Examples

   This section shows some examples how transport addresses are encoded
   and rendered using some of the initial transport domain and address
   definitions.

6. IANA Considerations

   It is intended that IANA will maintain this MIB module. 

   Following the policies outlined in RFC 2434 [18], additions to this
   module MUST be reviewed by a Designated Expert. 

7. Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines assigned values for commonly used transport
   addressing domains, and a set of textual conventions. It does not
   define any MIB objects that actually contain management information. 

   As such, there are no security considerations for this MIB module. 

8. Acknowledgments

   Some of the definitions in this module are taken directly from RFC
   1906 [11]. 

   The authors would like to thank Mark Ellison, Brian Haberman, and
   Bill Strahm for their comments and suggestions.

Appendix A. Open Issues

   1.  Provide suitable domain and TC definitions for DNS names, e.g.
       www.tu-bs.de:80? 
   2.  This version adopts a URL format wherever possible, e.g.
       10.1.2.3:80 instead of 10.1.2.3/80 for IPv4 and
       [00:00:00:00:0A:01:02:03]:80 instead of
       00:00:00:00:0A:01:02:03/80 for IPv6 (RFC 2732).  Is this useful?
       Are the DISPLAY-HINT to achieve the desired output format
       acceptable? 
   3.  Need to find experts to review the TC definitions for protocols
       we are not familiar with. 
   4.  Add references and REFERENCE clauses for the various address
       formats? Probably copying stuff from RFC 1906? Are they still
       valid? 
   5.  More explicit guidelines on the usage of the IanaTAddressType
       TC, similar to what is in the INET-ADDRESS-MIB document? 
   6.  More precise guidelines for IANA and/or the designated expert on
       how to keep the various definitions in sync? 
   7.  Keep the acknowledgements section updated.
