Internet-Draft      NEMO Basic Support within PMIPv6          March 2008


1.  Introduction

   Network Mobility Basic Support (NBS) described in [1] provides that a
   Mobile Network (NEMO) moves from its home link to a new link based on
   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [2].  The base protocol for NBS is MIPv6 and
   derived scenarios therefore focused on the interactions between NBS
   and MIPv6.  As Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is deployed [3], a NEMO
   will be initialized in or move to a PMIPv6 domain.  Thus, the
   scenarios where NBS operates within PMIPv6 need to be analyzed as a
   guideline to PMIPv6 deployments.  Note that the interaction scenarios
   between PMIPv6 and MIPv6 are presented in [4].

   This document specifies the scenarios where NBS operates within
   PMIPv6 and related issues.  In addition, an analysis for each
   scenario is presented.  The NEMO Route Optimization is not considered
   in the scenarios because this document focuses on the interactions
   between NBS and PMIPv6.

2.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [5].

2.2.  Terminology

   Terminologies related to mobility support are defined in [3] and [6].
   The following terminologies are frequently used in this document.

   o  Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain (PMIPv6 domain), As defined in [3], it
      refers to the network where the mobility management is handled by
      PMIPv6.

   o  Non-Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain (Non-PMIPv6 domain), It refers to the
      network in where PMIPv6 is not supported.

   o  Mobile Network (NEMO): As defined in [6], it is an entire network
      that consists of one or more subnets and involves any node (host
      or router).  A NEMO can be initialized at an Non-PMIPv6 domain or
      at a PMIPv6 domain and move from and to different mobility
      management domains.  In this document, a NEMO is classified into
      two types: Mobile Network-MIPv6 and Mobile Network-PMIPv6.

   o  Mobile Network-MIPv6 (NEMO-MIPv6): It is a NEMO that has been
      initialized at an Non-PMIPv6 domain.  The Home Address (HoA) of

Internet-Draft      NEMO Basic Support within PMIPv6          March 2008


      NEMO-MIPv6 is configured from a prefix advertised in the home
      link.

   o  Mobile Network-PMIPv6 (NEMO-PMIPv6): It is a NEMO that has been
      initialized at a PMIPv6 domain.  The HoA of NEMO-PMIPv6 is taken
      from the Home Network Prefix (HNP) that is topologically anchored
      at the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) defined in [3].  From a
      perspective of NEMO-PMIPv6, the LMA acts as the Home Agent (HA).

   o  Mobile Router (MR): As defined in [6], it is a router that acts as
      a gateway in a NEMO.  In this document, an MR MUST take cognizance
      of that the current domain provides a PMIPv6 service or not.

   o  Mobile Router of Mobile Network-MIPv6 (MR-NEMO-MIPv6): It is an MR
      that acts as a gateway in the current NEMO-MIPv6.

   o  Mobile Router of Mobile Network-PMIPv6 (MR-NEMO-PMIPv6): It is an
      MR that acts as a gateway in the current NEMO-PMIPv6.

   o  Bi-directional Tunnel between a Mobile Router and its Home Agent
      (MRHA tunnel): As defined in [6], it is a bi-directional tunnel
      between an MR and its HA.  In NBS, this tunnel is used to preserve
      session continuance between the MR and the HA.

   o  Mobile Router Identifier (MR-Identifier): It is an identity for an
      MR used in a PMIPv6 domain.  Similar to Mobile Node Identifier
      (MN-Identifier) defined in [3], mobility entities in a PMIPv6
      domain MUST acquire and use it for identifying an MR.  NAI or MAC
      address of MR can be used as an identifier.

   o  Care-of Address of Mobile Router in Mobile Network-MIPv6 (CoA-
      NEMO-MIPv6): It is a Care-of Address (CoA) of MR-NEMO-MIPv6
      obtained in the new link.  When a NEMO-MIPv6 enters to a PMIPv6
      domain, the CoA is configured based on the HNP and is used as long
      as the NEMO-MIPv6 is attached to the PMIPv6 domain.

   o  Care-of Address of Mobile Router in Mobile Network-PMIPv6 (CoA-
      NEMO-PMIPv6): It is a CoA of MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 obtained in another
      PMIPv6.  This address is configured based on the HNP and is used
      as long as the NEMO-PMIPv6 is attached to the PMIPv6 domain.

   o  Home Address of Mobile Router in Mobile Network-MIPv6 (HoA-NEMO-
      MIPv6): It is a HoA of MR-NEMO-MIPv6 obtained in the home link.

   o  Home Address of Mobile Router in Mobile Network-PMIPv6 (HoA-NEMO-
      PMIPv6): It is a HoA of MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 obtained in the home PMIPv6
      domain.  This address is configured based on the HNP defined in
      [3].

   o  Mobile Network Prefix (MNP): As defined in [6], it is a network
      prefix delegated to an MR that is used to advertise in the NEMO.

   o  Mobile Network Node (MNN): As defined in [6], it represents any
      node that exists and has an address containing the MNP in a NEMO.
      A MNN is classified into three types: Local Fixed Node, Visiting
      Mobile Node, and Local Mobile Node.

   o  Local Fixed Node (LFN): As defined in [6], it represents any
      normal node that has no mobility support stack.  An LFN cannot
      change its point of attachment while communicating with other
      nodes and its address is taken from the MNP in a NEMO.

   o  Visiting Mobile Node (VMN): As defined in [6], it represents any
      node that has a mobility support stack.  A VMN is a temporarily
      attached node in a NEMO.  From a perspective of VMN, the NEMO is a
      foreign link in where the VMN obtains its CoA from the MNP.

   o  Local Mobile Node (LMN): As defined in [6], it represents any node
      that has a mobility support stack.  From a perspective of LMN, the
      NEMO is a home link in where the LMN obtains its HoA from the MNP.

   o  Local Mobility Anchor existing in the home PMIPv6 doamin (LMAh):
      It is a Local Mobility Anchor for NEMO-PMIPv6 in the home PMIPv6
      doamin.

   o  Local Mobility Anchor existing in the visit PMIPv6 doamin (LMAv):
      It is a Local Mobility Anchor for NEMO-PMIPv6 in the visit PMIPv6
      doamin.

   o  AAA server existing in the home domain (AAAh): It is a AAA server
      for a NEMO in the home domain.  The AAAh is responsible for
      authenticating and authorizing the NEMO.

   o  AAA server existing in the visit domain (AAAv): It is a AAA server
      for a NEMO in the visit domain.  The AAAv is responsible for
      authenticating and authorizing the NEMO.  The AAAv and the AAAh
      have a security association to support security credential
      exchanges.


3.  Overview of scenarios

   Several interaction scenarios between NBS and PMIPv6 exist.  In the
   following scenarios, a NEMO ensure that all MNNs keep their session
   continuance while the NEMO moves around.  The main goal of describing
   scenarios is to show how to establish the MRHA tunnel between a NEMO
   and its HA when the NEMO moves within PMIPv6 domains.

Internet-Draft      NEMO Basic Support within PMIPv6          March 2008


   In the all scenarios, the mobility service selection option defined
   in [7] SHOULD be used to select the PMIPv6 service by a NEMO.  AAA
   servers are used to provide secure access service and service
   parameters when the NEMO is attached in the access link.  Note that
   the MR-Identifier is used as like as the use of the MN-Identifier.

3.1.  Scenario A

   As shown in Figure 1, Scenario A describes that a NEMO moves from an
   Non-PMIPv6 domain to a PMIPv6 domain.  There are two identified sub-
   scenarios depending on the NEMO type.

3.1.1.  Scenario A.1

   In this scenario, a NEMO-MIPv6 that has been initialized at an Non-
   PMIPv6 domain moves from another Non-PMIPv6 domain to a PMIPv6
   domain.

   As the NEMO-MIPv6 moves from the Non-PMIPv6 domain to the PMIPv6
   domain, it attaches to one of MAGs.  Similar to the MN attachment
   defined in [3], the NEMO-MIPv6 MUST be authenticated and authorized
   by the deployed security service mechanism.  For instance, the AAA
   server can be used for authenticating and authorizing the MR-NEMO-
   MIPv6 based on the MR-Identifier.  The serving MAG, MAG1, sends a
   Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to the LMAv.  Upon accepting the
   PBU message, the LMAv sends a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA)
   message to the MAG1.  As a result of registration, a bi-directional
   tunnel between the MAG1 and the LMAv for the NEMO-MIPv6 is
   established.  As the MAG1 adverties a Router Advertisement (RA)
   message cotaining the HNP, the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 obtains its CoA based on
   the HNP.  In other words, the MR in NEMO-MIPv6 configues its CoA-
   NEMO-MIPv6 from the HNP in the PMIPv6 domain.  The configured CoA-
   NEMO-MIPv6 is registered to the HA by sending Binding Update (BU)
   message as defined in [1].  The HA on receiving the BU message
   establishes a binding between the HoA-NEMO-MIPv6 and CoA-NEMO-MIPv6
   of MR.  As a result of establishing the binding, the HA can forward
   the packets for NEMO-MIPv6 to the current attachement point of MR-
   NEMO-MIPv6.

3.1.2.  Scenario A.2

   In this scenario, a NEMO-PMIPv6 that has been initialized at a PMIPv6
   domain moves from an Non-PMIPv6 domain to another PMIPv6 domain.

   As the NEMO-PMIPv6 moves from the Non-PMIPv6 domain to the PMIPv6
   domain, it attaches to one of MAGs.  Similar to Scenario A.1, after
   successful authentication and authorization for PMIPv6 service, the
   registration procedure between the MAG1 and the LMAv is performed.  A
   point of difference between Scenario A.1 and Scenario A.2 is that the
   MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 registers its CoA, CoA-NEMO-PMIPv6, to the LMAh by
   sending BU message.  The LMAh on receiving the BU message sent from
   the MR establishes a binding between the HoA-NEMO-PMIPv6 and CoA-
   NEMO-PMIPv6 of MR.

3.2.  Scenario B

   This scenario describes that a NEMO moves between links in a PMIPv6
   domain as shown in Figure 2.  There are three identified sub-
   scenarios depending on the NEMO type.

   Figure 2.  Scenario B: a NEMO moves between links in a PMIPv6 domain

3.2.1.  Scenario B.1

   In this scenario, a NEMO-MIPv6 that has been initialized at an Non-
   PMIPv6 domain moves between links in a PMIPv6 domain.

   This scenario is an extension of Scenario A.1.  As described in

   Scenario A.1, the NEMO-MIPv6 has been registered at both the LMAv and
   the HA.  According to [3], there is no additionally registration
   messages by sending the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 whenever the NEMO-MIPv6 moves
   between links in the PMIPv6 domain.  The serving MAG, MAG2, sends a
   PBU message to the LMAv to inform that the NEMO-MIPv6 has been moved
   from the MAG1 to the MAG2.

3.2.2.  Scenario B.2

   In this scenario, a NEMO-PMIPv6 that has been initialized at a PMIPv6
   domain moves between links in another PMIPv6 domain.

   This scenario is an extension of Scenario A.2.  As described in
   Scenario A.2, the NEMO-PMIPv6 has been registered at both the LMAv
   and the LMAh.  When the NEMO-PMIPv6 attaches to the MAG2, the MAG2
   sends a PBU message to the LMAv.

3.2.3.  Scenario B.3

   In this scenario, a NEMO-PMIPv6 that has been initialized at a PMIPv6
   domain moves between links in the PMIPv6 domain.

   When the NEMO-PMIPv6 boots up in the PMIPv6 domain, it is registered
   to the LMAh as a result of PBU message sent from the MAG1.  The MR-
   NEMO-PMIPv6 also creates its HoA based on the RA message including
   the HNP.  The created HoA, pHoA-NEMO-PMIPv6, is used to send a BU
   message to the LMAh.  In this scenario, the LMAh acts as the HA of
   NEMO-PMIPv6.  Similar to Scenario B.2, the MAG2 sends a PBU message
   to the LMAh when the NEMO-PMIPv6 attaches to the MAG2.

3.3.  Scenario C

   This scenario describes that a NEMO moves between different PMIPv6
   domains as shown in Figure 3.  There are two identified sub-scenarios
   depending on the NEMO type.

   Figure 3.  Scenario C: a NEMO moves between different PMIPv6 domains

3.3.1.  Scenario C.1

   In this scenario, a NEMO-MIPv6 that has been initialized at an Non-
   PMIPv6 domain moves between different PMIPv6 domains.

   As the NEMO-MIPv6 moves from a PMIPv6 domain (PMIPv6-v1 domain) to

   another PMIPv6 domain (PMIPv6-v2 domain), the CoA-NEMO-MIPv6 is
   changed because the serving MAG, MAG2, advertises a RA message
   including the different HNP that is previously assigned in the
   PMIPv6-v1 domain.  Similar to Scenario A.1, there are two types of
   registration; registering to the LMAv2 and registering to the HA.
   For registering to the LMAv2, the MAG2 sends a PBU message to the
   LMAv2 when the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 is attached to the MAG2.  As the MR-
   NEMO-MIPv6 receives the RA message from the MAG2, the MR sends a BU
   message to register its new CoA-NEMO-MIPv6 to the HA.

3.3.2.  Scenario C.2

   In this scenario, a NEMO-PMIPv6 that has been initialized at a PMIPv6
   domain moves between different PMIPv6 domains.

   Similar to Scenario C.1, the MAG2 registers the NEMO-PMIPv6 to the
   LMAv2 by sending PBU message.  The MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 on receiving the RA
   message sent from the MAG2 configures its new CoA-NEMO-PMIPv6 because
   the contained HNP in the RA message is a different HNP compared to
   the previous HNP.  After the address configuration, the MR-NEMO-
   PMIPv6 informs its new CoA-NEMO-PMIPv6 to the LMAh located in the
   home domain.

3.4.  Scenario D

   This scenario describes that a NEMO moves from a PMIPv6 domain to an
   Non-PMIPv6 domain as shown in Figure 4.  There are two identified
   sub-scenarios depending on the NEMO type.

   Figure 4.  Scenario D: a NEMO moves from a PMIPv6 domain to an Non-

3.4.1.  Scenario D.1

   In this scenario, a NEMO-MIPv6 that has been initialized at an Non-
   PMIPv6 domain moves from a PMIPv6 domain to another MIPv6 domain.

   As the NEMO-MIPv6 attaches to a new link in the Non-PMIPv6 domain,

   the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 receives a RA message sent from the access router
   (AR).  The MR-NEMO-MIPv6 takes cognizance of that it has been moved
   to a new link based on the RA message.  As described in [1], the MR-
   NEMO-MIPv6 sends a BU message to its HA after the adress
   configuration on the new link.

3.4.2.  Scenario D.2

   In this scenario, a NEMO-PMIPv6 that has been initialized at a PMIPv6
   domain moves from another PMIPv6 domain to an Non-PMIPv6 domain.

   As the NEMO-PMIPv6 attaches to a new link in the Non-PMIPv6 domain,
   the NEMO-PMIPv6 receives a RA message sent from the AR.  Similar to
   Scenario D.1, the MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 sends a BU message to its LMAh after
   the adress configuration on the new link.


4.  Chaining scenarios

   Scenarios described in Section 3 SHOULD be chained according to the
   movement patterns of NEMO.  The chaining scenarios is defined in the
   next version of this document.


5.  Analysis of scenarios

   This section presents the message flows for each scenario described
   in Section 3.  Based on the message flow, the tunneling management
   issues are presented.

5.1.  Message Flow

5.1.1.  Scenario A

   As mentioned in Section 3.1, Scenario A considers the case in where a
   NEMO moves from an Non-PMIPv6 domain to a PMIPv6 domain.

5.1.1.1.  Scenario A.1

   Figure 5 shows the message flow when the NEMO-MIPv6 that has been
   initialized at an Non-PMIPv6 domain enters from another Non-PMIPv6
   domain to a PMIPv6 domain.

   o  The NEMO-MIPv6 enters from the Non-PMIPv6 domain to a PMIPv6
      domain.

   o  The NEMO-MIPv6 is attached to the MAG1.

   Figure 5.  Message Flow for Scenario A.1

   o  The authentication procedure for PMIPv6 service is done between
      the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 and AAAv.

   o  The AAAv provides PMIPv6 service parameters including the MR-
      Identifier and the corresponding Local Mobility Anchor Address
      (LMAA) after successfully completing the authentication procedure.

   o  The MAG1 sends a PBU message to the LMAv.

   o  The LMAv sends a PBA message to the MAG1 after successfully
      completing the binding registration procedure.  As a result, the

      bi-directional tunnel between the MAG1 and the LMAv is established
      for the MR-NEMO-MIPv6.

   o  The MAG1 sends a RA message to the MR-NEMO-MIPv6.  The RA message
      includes the HNP that is the IPv6 prefix and is topologically
      anchored at the LMAv.

   o  Based on the HNP, the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 creates its new CoA-NEMO-
      MIPv6.

   o  The MR-NEMO-MIPv6 sends a BU message to its HA located in the home
      domain.

   o  The HA establishes a binding between the HoA-NEMO-MIPv6 and CoA-
      NEMO-MIPv6 of MR.

   o  Any packet destinated to the MNNs in the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 is
      forwarded to the current attachement point of MR-NEMO-MIPv6
      through the HA and the LMAv.

5.1.1.2.  Scenario A.2

   Figure 6 shows the message flow when the NEMO-PMIPv6 that has been
   initialized at a PMIPv6 domain moves from an Non-MIPv6 domain to
   another PMIPv6 domain.  The message flow is similar to Scenario A.1.
   Distinguishing differences are as follows.

   o  As the NEMO-PMIPv6 is attached to the MAG1, the AAAv requests the
      authentication decision to the AAAh.

   o  As the MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 configures its new CoA-NEMO-PMIPv6 based on
      the HNP contained in the RA message sent from the MAG1, it sends a
      BU message to its LMAh located in the home domain.

   o  The LMAh on receiving the BU message sent from MR-NEMO-PMIPv6
      establishes a binding between the HoA-NEMO-PMIPv6 and CoA-NEMO-
      PMIPv6.

5.1.2.  Scenario B

   As mentioned in Section 3.2, Scenario B considers the case in where a
   NEMO moves between links in a PMIPv6 domain.

5.1.2.1.  Scenario B.1

   Figure 7 shows the message flow when the NEMO-MIPv6 that has been
   initialized at an Non-PMIPv6 domain moves between links in a PMIPv6
   domain.  This scenario is an extension of Scenario A.1 or Scenario
   C.1.

   o  From a perspective of the PMIPv6 domain, the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 is
      treated as a node.  As the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 is attached to the MAG2,
      the MAG2 sends a PBU message to the LMAv on behalf of the MR-NEMO-
      MIPv6.

   o  The MR-NEMO-MIPv6 on receiving the RA message sent from the MAG2
      can continue to use the same address, CoA-NEMO-MIPv6, configured
      in the previous MAG.

   o  Since the CoA-NEMO-MIPv6 is not changed, the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 does
      not need to register its movement to the HA.  According to [3],
      the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 will always detect the same link as long as its
      attached network is in the scope of PMIPv6 domain.

   Since the MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 is registered by sending PBU message sent
   from MAG1 to the LMAh, the MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 configures its HoA-NEMO-
   PMIPv6 from the RA message sent from the MAG1.  The MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 is
   treated as a node as long as it moves in the PMIPv6 domain.

   o  As the MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 boots up in the PMIPv6 domain, it is
      attached to the MAG1.

   o  The authentication procedure between the MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 and the
      AAAh is done, then the MAG1 obtains PMIPv6 service parameters for
      the MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 through the AAAh.

   o  The binding registration procedure between the MAG1 and the LMAh
      is done.

   o  After the address configuration based on the RA message sent from
      the MAG1, the MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 sends a BU message to the LMAh.

   o  As the MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 moves from the MAG1 to the MAG2, the MAG2
      detects its movement.  Then the further message flow is the same
      to the case of Scenario B.2

5.1.3.  Scenario C

   As mentioned in Section 3.3, Scenario C considers the case in where a
   NEMO moves between different PMIPv6 domains, e.g., inter domain
   handoff.

5.1.3.1.  Scenario C.1

   Figure 10 shows the message flow when the NEMO-MIPv6 that has been
   initialized at an Non-PMIPv6 moves between different PMIPv6 domains.
   Becuase this scenario represents the inter domain handoff, two types
   of registration MUST be performed; registering to the current
   visiting LMA (LMAv2) and registering to the HA located in the home
   domain.  This scenario is an extension of Scenarios A.1 or B.1.

   o  As the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 moves to the new PMIPv6 domain in where the
      LMAv2 is the topological anchor point for all nodes' HNP, the MR-
      NEMO-MIPv6 performs the authentication procedure with the AAAv2.

   o  After successfully completing the authentication procedure, the
      serving MAG, MAG2, obtains PMIPv6 service parameters for the MR-
      NEMO-MIPv6 via the AAAv2.

   o  The binding registration procedure between the MAG2 and the LMAv2
      is done.

   o  The MAG2 sends a RA message to the MR-NEMO-MIPv6.

   o  The MR-NEMO-MIPv6 on receiving the RA message performs the address
      configuration procedure and then sends a BU message to its HA.

   o  The HA establishes a binding between the HoA-NEMO-MIPv6 and CoA-
      NEMO-MIPv6 of MR.

   Figure 11 shows the message flow when the NEMO-PMIPv6 that has been
   initialized at an Non-PMIPv6 moves between different PMIPv6 domains.
   Similar to Scenario C.1, it represents the inter domain handoff so

   current visiting LMA (LMAv2) and registering to the LMAh located in
   the home domain.  This scenario is an extension of Scenarios A.2 or

   differences are as follows.

   o  As the MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 receives the RA message from the MAG2, the
      MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 configures its new CoA-NEMO-PMIPv6 and then sends a
      BU message to its LMAh.

   o  The HA on receiving the BU message establishes a binding between
      the HoA-NEMO-PMIPv6 and CoA-NEMO-PMIPv6 of MR.

5.1.4.  Scenario D

   As mentioned in Section 3.4, Scenario D considers the case in where a
   NEMO moves from a PMIPv6 to an Non-PMIPv6 domain.

5.1.4.1.  Scenario D.1

   Figure 12 shows the message flow when the NEMO-MIPv6 that has been
   initialized at an Non-PMIPv6 domain moves from a PMIPv6 domain to
   another Non-PMIPv6 domain.  This scenario is an extension of
   Scenarios A.1 or B.1 or C.1.

   o  As the MR-NEMO-MIPv6 moves out from a PMIPv6, the MR-NEMO-MIPv6
      receives the RA message sent from AR in the new link.

   o  The MR-NEMO-MIPv6 creates its new CoA-NEMO-MIPv6 because the IPv6
      prefix is different from its previous prefix.  In other words, the
      MR-NEMO-MIPv6 takes cognizance of that it has been moved to a new
      link based on the prefix information sent from the AR.

   o  The MR-NEMO-MIPv6 sends a BU message to its LMAh to inform its
      movement.

5.1.4.2.  Scenario D.2

   Figure 13 shows the message flow when the NEMO-PMIPv6 that has been
   initialized at a PMIPv6 domain moves from another PMIPv6 domain to an
   Non-PMIPv6 domain.  This scenario is an extension of Scenarios A.2 or
   B.2 or C.2.  The message flow is similar to Scenario D.1.
   Distinguishing differences are as follows.

   o  As the MR-NEMO-PMIPv6 receives the RA message from the AR, the MR-
      NEMO-PMIPv6 configures its new CoA-NEMO-PMIPv6 and then sends a BU
      message to its LMAh.
