             Signaling MSD (Maximum SID Depth) using IS-IS
                 draft-ietf-isis-segment-routing-msd-10

Abstract

   This document defines a way for an IS-IS Router to advertise multiple
   types of supported Maximum SID Depths (MSDs) at node and/or link
   granularity.  Such advertisements allow entities (e.g., centralized
   controllers) to determine whether a particular SID stack can be
   supported in a given network.  This document only defines one type of
   MSD maximum label imposition, but defines an encoding that can
   support other MSD types.

1.  Introduction

   When Segment Routing(SR) paths are computed by a centralized
   controller, it is critical that the controller learns the Maximum SID
   Depth(MSD) that can be imposed at each node/link a given SR path to
   insure that the SID stack depth of a computed path doesn't exceed the
   number of SIDs the node is capable of imposing.

   PCEP SR extensions draft [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] signals MSD
   in SR PCE Capability TLV and METRIC Object.  However, if PCEP is not
   supported/configured on the head-end of a SR tunnel or a Binding-SID
   anchor node and controller does not participate in IGP routing, it
   has no way to learn the MSD of nodes and links which has been
   configured.  BGP-LS [RFC7752] defines a way to expose topology and
   associated attributes and capabilities of the nodes in that topology
   to a centralized controller.  MSD signaling by BGP-LS has been
   defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-msd].  Typically,
   BGP-LS is configured on a small number of nodes that do not
   necessarily act as head-ends.  In order for BGP-LS to signal MSD for
   all the nodes and links in the network MSD is relevant, MSD

   capabilites should be advertised to every IS-IS router in the
   network.

   Other types of MSD are known to be useful.  For example,
   [I-D.ietf-isis-mpls-elc] defines Readable Label Depth Capability
   (RLDC) that is used by a head-end to insert an Entropy Label (EL) at
   a depth, that could be read by transit nodes.

   This document defines an extension to IS-IS used to advertise one or
   more types of MSD at node and/or link granularity.  It also creates
   an IANA registry for assigning MSD type identifiers.  It also defines
   the Base MPLS Imposition MSD type.  In the future it is expected,
   that new MSD types will be defined to signal additional capabilities
   e.g., entropy labels, SIDs that can be imposed through recirculation,
   or SIDs associated with another dataplane e.g., IPv6.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4970].

3.  Node MSD Advertisement

   The node MSD sub-TLV is defined within the body of the IS-IS Router
   Capability TLV [RFC7981], to carry the provisioned SID depth of the
   router originating the Router Capability TLV.  Node MSD is the
   minimum MSD supported by the node on any interface.  MSD values may
   be learned via a hardware API or may be provisioned.

                        Figure 1: Node MSD Sub-TLV

   The Type: TBD1

   Length: variable (minimum of 2, multiple of 2 octets) and represents
   the total length of value field.

   Value: field consists of one or more pairs of a 1 octet MSD-Type
   (IANA Registry) and 1 octet Value.

   Node MSD value is a number in the range of 0-255. 0 represents lack
   of the ability to support SID stack of any depth; any other value
   represents that of the node.  This value MUST represent the lowest
   value supported by any link associated with the node.

   This sub-TLV is optional.  The scope of the advertisement is specific
   to the deployment.

4.  Link MSD Advertisement

   The link MSD sub-TLV is defined for TLVs 22, 23, 141, 222, and 223 to
   carry the MSD of the interface associated with the link.  MSD values
   may be learned via a hardware API or may be provisioned.

                        Figure 2: Link MSD Sub-TLV

   The Type: TBD2

   Length: variable (minimum of 2, multiple of 2 octets) and represents
   the total length of value field.

   Value: consists of one or more pairs of a 1 octet MSD-Type (IANA
   Registry) and 1 octet Value.

   Link MSD value is a number in the range of 0-255. 0 represents lack
   of the ability to support SID stack of any depth; any other value
   represents that of the link when used as an outgoing link.

   This sub-TLV is optional.  The scope of the advertisement is specific
   to the deployment.

5.  Using Node and Link MSD Advertisements

   When Link MSD is present for a given MSD type, the value of the Link
   MSD MUST take preference over the Node MSD.

   The meaning of the absence of both Node and Link MSD advertisements
   for a given MSD type is specific to the MSD type.  Generally it can
   only be inferred that the advertising node does not support
   advertisement of that MSD type.  However, in some cases the lack of
   advertisement might imply that the functionality associated with the

   MSD type is not supported.  The correct interpretation MUST be
   specified when an MSD type is defined.

6.  Base MPLS Imposition MSD

   Base MPLS Imposition MSD (BMI-MSD) signals the total number of MPLS
   labels a node is capable of imposing, including any service/transport
   labels.

   Absence of BMI-MSD advertisements indicates solely that the
   advertising node does not support advertisement of this capability.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to allocate a sub-TLV type (TBD1) for the
   new sub TLV proposed in Section 3 of this document from IS-IS Router
   Capability TLV Registry as defined by [RFC7981].

   IANA has allocated the following value through the early assignment
   process:


      Value     Description                      Reference
      -----     ---------------                  -------------
