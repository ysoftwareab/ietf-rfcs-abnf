I==1.  Set to a 32-bit value (beginning with 0) that is
V==1.  Covers the leading 128 bytes of the packet beginning with
Offset=0), if the packet is larger than (MINMTU-HLEN) the ITE uses IP
I=1 and writes a monotonically-incrementing integer value for this
PMTU=2KB.  If the ITE subsequently receives a PTB message with MTU==0
PMTU=(1500+HLEN).  If the ITE is performing stateful MTU
V=1(when USE_ICV is TRUE).

RATE_LIMIT=FALSE to determine whether the path still requires rate

DF=1 and re-calculate the IPv4 header checksum while transcribing the
