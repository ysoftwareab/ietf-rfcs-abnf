Abstract

   SUAP will define a generic policy information model, an imperative
   (Event-Condition-Action, ECA) policy information model and a
   declarative (intent-based) policy information model which is the
   extension of the generic information model, and a set of policy data
   models which will make use of the common concepts defined in the
   information model. This memo will explore some typical use cases and
   demonstrate the applicability of SUPA policy models.

1. Introduction

   One of the ways for network service automation is using network
   management and operation software applications. The applications
   should not directly communicate with each network element; a
   hierarchical and extensible framework should be considered to hide
   the protocol specific and/or vendor specific details, high level
   network and service abstraction, and standardized programming API
   will be necessary.

   SUPA will define policy information models and data models, for
   service management and operation applications. [I-D.strassner-supa-
   generic-policy-info-model] defines a common set of concepts for
   various data models which may use different languages, protocols,
   and repositories.

   Three information models are defined in [I-D.strassner-supa-generic-
   policy-info-model]: Generic Policy Information Model (GPIM), Eca
   Policy Rule Information Model (EPRIM), Logic Statement Information
   Model (LSIM). The ECA information model is intended for dynamic
   service automation; while the LSIM is intended for expressing high
   requirements without being involved in network details.

   Data models can be defined by developers / operators or by any third
   party, as long as they follow the common concepts defined in SUPA
   information model. [I-D.chen-supa-eca-data-model] defines a policy
   data model of Event-Condition-Action (ECA), which is an example.

   R: References (i.e., the information model is used by the system to
   instantiate the data model).



   As shown in Figure 1, SUPA will define generic policy information
   models, which are independent of services and use cases. Policy data
   models can be derived from the generic information models. The data
   model will define high level, maybe network-wide policies. Policy
   data model will be used in conjunction with service data models to
   generate configurations for network elements. The service data model
   is use case specific and will be developed by operators or third
   parties, which is out the scope of SUPA.

   The service management applications will send SUPA data models to
   the service management system, where policy making and automated
   policy enforcement will be performed, and the data models will be
   mapped to configuration of network elements. Configuration of
   network elements is vendor specific, using various protocols, such
   Netconf, Restconf, etc.

   SUPA also make use of information collected from network elements.
   The information may include warning or fault event, load status,
   traffic statistics, etc, which can be used to adjust network
   configurations. This kind of automation is done through ECA data
   models.

                    Figure 2 Switched Ethernet Service


   Switched Ethernet services (SES) to Small and Medium Businesses
   business is a growing business segment of the service provider. As
   the Enterprise's applications grow in demands in terms of the
   bandwidth and richness of applications, WAN optimization is needed
   to improve the service quality. SUPA policy data models can be used
   for maximizing the WAN performance by analyzing the traffic and
   performing application management and acceleration tools for the
   network.

   In the use case below, Service Manager (SM) is used for service and
   policy definition and Network Manager (Controller) is used for

Internet-Draft        SUPA Model Applicability               July 2015


   network topology maintenance and mapping data models to detail
   network configurations.

   While speed and bandwidth are at the forefront of the WAN
   Optimization there need to be tools in place to detect, diagnose,
   remedy and report application performance to ensure the SLAs for a
   customer are enforced.

   The service is modeled in terms of what kind of service (Ethernet,
   VLAN), bandwidth (10Mbps- 10 Gbps), service package (platinum, gold,
   silver) etc.

   Policy models are based on an Event condition action like:

   1.           Bandwidth usage alarm triggers data caching

   2.           Latency alarm triggers reduction of re transmission

   3.           WAN outage at a specific site can trigger geographic redundancy
      (provided the service is setup for GR)

   The above are 3 of the primitives (Event condition action - ECA) on
   which the run time operations could be based on. When the service
   model is comprehensively designed with more possibilities
   (variables), more policy models could be implemented

4.1.1.2. Generic Policy Information Models

   Requirements and configurations derived from above application
   scenarios can be described by service data model and policy data
   models as below:

   Service data model can be used to describe attributes for the SES,
   including service package type (Platinum, gold etc), bandwidth
   bought by the subscriber (100Mbps, 10Gbps), connection name -copper/
   GigE, latency, etc.

   Policy data model describes a condition when the link capacity
   reaches 90%, Service prioritization and WAN optimization need to be
   enforced based on the customers service package. Event is the link
   utilization and condition is the usage and action is the WAN
   optimization. The actions could trigger multiple actions like data
   compression, protocol acceleration (like streaming gets priority)
   which are beyond the scope of SUPA

4.1.1.3. Programmatic approach - SUPA modeling

   The advantage of the programmatic approach can be maximized by
   defining as many SUPA ECA models as possible in a top down approach

   In this use case, since this is a switched service, point to point
   traffic can be identified (by IP Address and port number) and
   segmented and whole bandwidth can be utilized by many applications
   simultaneously. Examples are: Print jobs, backups etc..

   The benefit of the SUPA is in creating many policies upfront. As the
   operations grow in complexity SUPA can expand an existing policy by
   adding more variables. This is how reusable policies can be
   developed upfront and configuration and maintenance operations can
   be dealt by modeling and programmatic approach.



4.1.2. DDC Use Case

    A data center can provide various services, such as video host, VMs,
    etc. In order to provide better user experience, the contents may be
    located in multiple geographically distributed data centers so that
    the user can get service from a nearby location. The content
    distribution between data centers is necessary, an example is, for a
    social video service provider, they need to copy videos uploaded by
    users to all the data centers. Another example is, cloud operator
    may needs to migrate VMs from one location to another. This kind of
    operation usually will require a lot of bandwidth. To avoid
    consuming too much network resource in the busy hours, it is usually
    done in the non-busy hours, such as 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning.

    Example:

     Event: time of the day

     Condition: now is Evening

     Action:

         Configure a VPN for VM migration for 2 hours



4.1.3. Instant VPN

       Provide VPN connection for Customer A when receiving a request.


xxx                   Expires January 23, 2016                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        SUPA Model Applicability               July 2015


       (Figure to be added)

       Traditionally, when an operator needs to deploy VPN service for
       an enterprise customer, they will send a service staff to the
       customer site and make the wire connection between the CE and PE;
       the service staff will also collect the configuration information,
       e.g. port/frame/slot of PE, PE ID, etc, and then send the
       information back to the management system, and the management
       system will configure the network according to this information
       together with the customer' information (such as bandwidth, SLA,
       etc).

       The problem of this approach is that the service staff needs to
       collect the connection information and feedback to the management
       system, and MUST make sure the information matches the actual
       connection. This operation is error prone.

       New approach should not count on the physical / geographical
       information feedback by the service staff, minimize the operation
       procedures. The CE should send authentication (with credentials)
       request to the PE, and PE should forward the request to the
       management system together with port/frame/slot on which the
       request is received, the PE ID etc.



     Example:

          Event: receive customer VPN service request

          Condition: YES (received valid request)

          Action:

             Configure VPN service for the customer



     In the above cases, the advantage of SUPA ECA model is, it can work
     for different scenarios with a common set of concept: events,
     conditions, actions, etc.

4.2. Declarative Data Model
    Logic Statement Information Model (LSIM) can also be called as
    declarative or intent model. This type of model will describe the
    service intention without specifying low level details, such

Internet-Draft        SUPA Model Applicability               July 2015


    protocol level or network device level detail, but just the service
    requirements itself.

    Example1:

       All SNMP agents in my network should drop all SNMP traffic unless
       it is originating or targeted to the management network

       The management system will expand this requirement according to
       the network topology which is provided by other systems, and get
       a list of all the involved network elements which should be
       configured.

       The SNMP traffic can be identified by the TCP/UDP port 161/162;
       and if the traffic is originating or targeted to management can
       be identified by the source or destination address or the traffic,
       but, which is out of scope of SUPA.

       With the above information, the management system can generate
       and install configurations to all the related network elements.
       The administrator does not have to specify any protocol level or
       network device level details during network management.



   Example: Virtual DC

       Request: Create a virtual DC for customer B with specified
       resource (BW, storage, compute)

       (Figure to be added)

       When cloud / DC operator signs a contract with customer, resource
       information such as network bandwidth, storage size, number of
       CPU, memory size, etc, will be specified.

       But in deployment, the resources may be located in multiple
       distributed data centers, and tunnels will be created to inter-
       connect these resources, which will make it look like one
       seamless entity - a virtual DC. There could be quite a number of
       tunnels, and the tunnels are dynamic, either for the reason of
       load balancing purpose or VM migration, or other reasons. This
       will make it difficult to configure the service statically or
       manually, service automation is very necessary.

       The service management system will have a repository of available
       resources, including the topology. And also the management system

Internet-Draft        SUPA Model Applicability               July 2015


       will have the customer specific information (location, SLA,
       agreed resources, etc).

       The administrator can send the service requirement to the
       management system by a high level data model, which can further
       be mapped to low level detail data models, then finally mapped to
       configurations of network devices.



5. Security Considerations

   Since SUPA models can be used to generate configurations for network
   elements, the management applications which send models to service
   management system must go through authentication and authorization.

6. IANA Considerations

   This memo does not have any requirement to IANA.
