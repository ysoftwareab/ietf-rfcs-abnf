                   IETF Meeting Network Requirements
                      draft-odonoghue-netrqmts-02

Abstract

   The IETF Meeting Network has become integral to the success of any
   physical IETF meeting.  Building such a network, which provides
   service to thousands of heavy users and their multitude of devices,
   spread throughout the event venue, with very little time for setup
   and testing is a challenge.  This document provides a set of
   requirements, derived from hard won experience, as an aid to anyone
   involved in designing and deploying such future networks.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF Meeting Network has grown and evolved over time as has the
   IETF overall.  In addition, the way that the IETF network is built
   and provisioned has also changed.  It is time for the IETF community
   to consider the requirements of this infrastructure and its role in
   supporting the mission of the IETF.  This document is meant to help
   frame that conversation.  Additionally, this document may eventually
   be developed to be useful to others outside the IETF in specifying
   and building their own successful event networks.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Requirements for Internet Connectivity

   o  A primary and backup link MUST be provided for redundancy.  If
      technically feasible, these links SHOULD be aggregated or load
      balanced.

   o  The primary and backup links MUST provide at least 1 Gbps
      bandwidth in both directions.

         Recent events have peaked at roughly 850 Mbps and averaged in
         the 100-300 Mbps range.  We expect peak bandwidth requirements
         to continue to grow at a roughly 40-60% compound annual growth
         rate.

   o  IPv6 MUST be provided.

   o  The transit provided in support of the IETF MUST be capable of
      providing access to the IPv4 and IPv6 default free zones without
      the imposition of content filtering (e.g., URL, Site, application,
      port, or DPI based filtering).

   o  The primary and secondary links MUST support BGP peering.

   o  The provider(s) MUST allow the IETF to advertise (from the IETF AS
      number) the IETF IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges.

   o  The provider(s) MUST implement IRR (or better) route filtering.

   o  The backup link SHOULD be supplied by a different Internet service
      provider from the primary link.

   o  The primary and backup links SHOULD have physical and logical path
      diversity.

   o  The provider(s) SHOULD carry and advertise full BGP tables.

   o  The provider(s) SHOULD implement BGP communities, especially the
      ability to RTBH.

3.  Meeting Facility Requirements

   o  All locations for network gear, with the exception of wireless
      APs, MUST be secure.

   o  If wireless will be used for an external link then access to the
      roof or installed location MUST be provided.

   o  The meeting facility MUST have adequate ventilation to support the
      equipment rooms and the terminal room.

   o  The meeting facility MUST have adequate power available to support
      the equipment required to support the network infrastructure and
      its users.  This may include 110v/220v requirements in technical
      closets, roof locations, and various public and back-of-the-house
      areas.

   o  The meeting facility MUST provide sufficient power in all meeting
      rooms to handle the projected load from users' laptops.  The
      projected load is for simultaneous usage for 100% of the projected
      number of attendees in each meeting room and the number of laptop
      users and projecting 70 watts of power usage per laptop.

         (?? do we want to provide actual power estimates?)

   o  The meeting facility MUST provide the network installation team
      with access to key telecom spaces from one hour prior to the
      beginning of sessions to one hour after the end of sessions and
      9am to 5pm daily during the setup period.

         (?? are these the right timeframes)

   o  The meeting facility SHOULD provide the network installation team
      with 24 hour access to key telecom spaces.

   o  The meeting facility SHOULD have physical characteristics that
      support the deployment of additional wireless networks including
      techniques to limit interference where possible

         (?? or something along those lines).

   o  The meeting facility SHOULD have installed network cabling that
      can be used to deploy the network infrastructure.

         (?? is this a should or must, are we past the days of running
         cable if we need to... )

   o  The meeting facility The meeting facility SHOULD have
      Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) available to support key
      network infrastructure components, including at least the core
      routers, core switches, and hardware to maintain the external
      links.

      for any traffic (no limiting firewalls or NATs).

   o  The network SHOULD have separate VLANS for wired (primarily
      terminal room and audio) and wireless traffic.

   o  The network SHOULD have mechanisms for detecting and silencing
      rogue servers (for example, DHCP, IPv6 RA's, etc.).

4.1.  Requirements for Terminal Room or equivalent

   o  A terminal room or quiet work space MUST be provided.  This room
      MAY be a single room or distributed sites in reasonable proximity
      to the meeting rooms.

   o  The IETF users MUST have access to the terminal room from ?? to
      ??.

   o  Power strips MUST be provided in the terminal room.

   o  The terminal room MUST provide at least one network connected
      enterprise class printer.  These printers SHOULD have duplex
      capability.

         (?? Is an enterprise class printer required?  Have we been
         doing that?)

   o  A color printer MAY be provided.

   o  The terminal room SHOULD provide access to some number of wired
      Ethernet drops in addition to the standard wireless network.

   o  There SHOULD be a manned help desk from ?? to ??.  The help desk

      gathering areas.

4.2.  Requirements for Wireless

   o  The network design MUST anticipate simultaneous usage of 100% of
      the projected number of attendees in each meeting room.  and the
      number of wireless network users (historical utilization in excess
      of 1000 simultaneous wireless users has been observed during a
      plenary session).

   o  The network MUST provide Wi-Fi coverage in all meeting rooms (as
      identified by the Secretariat), common gathering spaces around the
      meeting rooms, the registration area, and the terminal room.

   o  The network MUST provide at least one secure SSID and one open
      SSID.

   o  The network SHOULD provide Wi-Fi coverage in additional common
      spaces in the meeting venue including the lobby, bar, restaurant,
      and most commonly used hallways of the primary meeting hotel(s).

   o  The network MAY provide separate SSIDs for different specific
      requirements.

   o  The network MAY provide additional secured wireless access.

   o  There SHOULD be mechanisms for identifying and silencing rogue
      Wireless Access Points.

4.3.  Requirements for Services

   o  The network MUST provide sufficient monitoring to ensure adequate
      network availability and to detect faults before they impact the
      user experience.

   o  The network MUST collect data for future use in scaling IETF
      meeting network requirements.  Minimum required metrics include
      bandwidth utilization (average and peak) for each external
      connection and user density per AP and radio.

   o  The network SHOULD provide some visibility into the state of the
      network for attendees (e.g. public graphs of network utilization,
      number of wireless associations, etc.).

   o  The network provider SHOULD provide SNMP read-only access to the
      network devices to individuals as identified by the Secretariat
      for network management and planning purposes.

5.  Miscellaneous Requirements

   o  A document MUST be provided to attendees detailing on-site network
      configuration information, including wireless configuration
      details, services available (e.g., printing), instructions on how
      to report network issues (e.g. trouble ticket system interface
      instructions), etc.  Initial versions of this information SHOULD
      be provided in advance of the meeting.

   o  The network provider MUST NOT view the IETF network as an
      experimental facility at the risk of impacting the IETF attendee
      experience.  (Do not experiment with his/her favorite pet
      technology.)

   o  The network provider SHOULD maintain spares of critical network
      components on-site.

   o  Attendees SHOULD be notified of power connector requirements well
      in advance of the meeting via the IETF meeting web page.

   o  The network provider SHOULD have attended at least one prior IETF
      to observe the IETF network deployment and operation.
