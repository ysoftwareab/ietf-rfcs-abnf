Internet-Draft            SMS Service Selector                  May 1999


1. Introduction

1.1 GSTN Service Selector

   [RFC2303] originally specified the way to insert GSTN (formerly PSTN)
   telephone numbers in Internet email addresses. That document also
   introduced the concept of a Service Selector, which specifies the
   intended usage for the phone number. In that particular document, the
   string "SMS" was given as an example of a Service Selector. However,
   the syntax and meaning of that Service Selector was not documented.
   This document tries to remedy that issue.

1.2 The "SMS" Service Selector

   The "SMS" Service Selector identifies a phone number of a device
   which is able to receive Short Messages. Short Messages are (often
   bidirectional) alphanumeric messages. Short Messages are widely used
   in GSM networks, but can be found in other networks as well.

   Examples include NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephone) analogue network, TDMA
   (IS-136) digital network, and others. A gateway, which provides the
   means to convey internet originated e-mail messages to a particular
   network using SMS, may need to know the type of the network and
   possibly need to provide some additional parameters to facilitate the
   delivery of a Short Message in the given network.

   The type of network can be optionally expressed as a Service
   Qualifier.

1.3 Convergence with the "gsm-sms" URL Scheme

   [DRAFT-GSM-SMS-URL] was revised to converge with this specification.

1.4 The "VIA" Service Qualifier

   Short Message services usually rely on a middleman to deliver the
   messages, sometimes called a Short Message Service Centre.  Sometimes
   specifying the phone number of this middleman is required. For this
   purpose, one can use the "VIA" Service Qualifier.

1.5 The "NET" Service Qualifier

   The "NET" Service Qualifier describes the network type in which the
   recipient is in. This is required because the gateway must know
   whether it is able to relay the message or not, and which method of
   delivery it has to use. In an environment where the gateway only

Internet-Draft            SMS Service Selector                  May 1999


   supports one network type and does not guarantee delivery, this
   Qualifier can be left out.

1.6 Requirements

   Compliant software MUST follow this specification. Requirements are
   indicated by capitalized words as specified in [RFC2119].

2. Definitions

2.1 Definition of the "SMS" Service Selector

   The <service-selector> element in [DRAFT-FAX-FULLADDR] is "SMS".

   This specifies a recipient of a Short Message in a mobile phone or
   pager network. How the contents of the email are interpreted and
   mapped to the Short Message are left as an implementation issue.  If
   the gateway cannot deliver the message, it SHOULD send an appropriate
   negative acknowledgement to the sender.

   An example:

      SMS=+1-408-555-123456

2.2 Definition of the "VIA" Service Qualifier

   See [DRAFT-IETF-FULLADDR] for the description of <qualif-type1> and
   <global-phone>.

   The "VIA" Qualifier is defined as follows:

      qualif-type1 "keyword" name:

          VIA

      qualif-type1 "value" ABNF definition:

         value             = message-centre-id
         message-centre-id = ["+"] phone-number
         phone-number     = 1*phonedigit
         phonedigit       = digit / "-" / "."
         digit            = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" /
                            "6" / "7" / "8" / "9"

   The <global-phone> element describes the GSTN number of a Short
   Message Service Centre, which takes care of Short Message delivery to

Internet-Draft            SMS Service Selector                  May 1999


   the recipient.

   If the "VIA" Qualifier is present, the gateway MUST send the message
   via this Short Message Service Centre or not send it at all.

   An example:

      SMS=+1-408-555-1234/VIA=+358-50-123-1234

2.3 Definition of the "NET" Service Qualifier

   See [DRAFT-IETF-FULLADDR] for the description of <qualif-type1> and
   <string>.

   The "NET" Qualifier is defined as follows:

      qualif-type1 "keyword" name:

          NET

      qualif-type1 "value" ABNF definition:

         value        = network-type
         network-type = "GSM" / other-type
         other-type   = string

   This Qualifier specifies the recipient's network type. "GSM" means
   any GSM-based network (independent of the frequency band used). If
   there is a requirement for other network types, the names for those
   MUST be specified by another RFC and registered using another IANA
   registration template. If the gateway is unable to deliver the
   message, it SHOULD send an appropriate negative acknowledgement back
   to the sender.

   An example:

      SMS=+1-408-555-1234/VIA=+358-50-123-1234/NET=GSM

4. Security Considerations

   It should be noted that the user agent SHOULD NOT send out Short
   Messages without the knowledge of the user because of associated
   risks, which include sending masses of Short Messages to a subscriber
   without her consent and the costs involved in sending a Short
   Message.

   The user agent SHOULD have some mechanism that the user can use to
   filter out unwanted destinations for Short Messages. The user agent
   SHOULD also have some means of restricting the number of Short
   Messages sent.

      Description of Use:

         SMS - SMS, an acronym for Short Message Service, is a (possibly
         bidirectional) alphanumeric paging message found in several
         mobile phone systems. The recipient of the Short Message is
         identified by a phone number. The Service Selector and its
         Qualifiers are defined in [DRAFT-SMS-SERVICE].

      Security Considerations:

         It should be noted that the user agent SHOULD NOT send out
         Short Messages without the knowledge of the user because of
         associated risks, which include sending masses of Short
         Messages to a subscriber without her consent and the costs
