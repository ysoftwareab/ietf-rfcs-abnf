1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint] defines a method of using Bidirectional
   Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] to monitor and detect unicast failures
   between the sender (head) and one or more receivers (tails) in
   multipoint or multicast networks.  This document describes procedures
   for using such mode of BFD protocol to detect data plane failures in
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) point-to-multipoint (p2mp) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs).  The document also describes the applicability
   of out-band solutions to bootstrap a BFD session in this environment.

   GAL: G-ACh Label

2.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Multipoint BFD Encapsulation

   [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint] defines how the tail of multipoint BFD
   session demultiplexes received BFD control packet when Your
   Discriminator is not set, i.e., equals zero.  Because
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint] uses BFD in Demand mode the head of BFD
   multipoint session transmits BFD control packets with Your
   Discriminator set to zero.  As a result, a tail cannot demultiplex
   BFD sessions using Your Discriminator, as defined in [RFC5880].
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint] requires that in order to demultiplex BFD
   sessions the tail uses the source IP address, My Discriminator and
   the identity of the multipoint tree which the Multipoint BFD Control
   packet was received from.  The identity of the multipoint tree MAY be
   provided by the p2mp MPLS LSP label in case of inclusive p-tree or
   upstream assigned label in case of aggregate p-tree.  The source IP
   address MAY be drawn from the IP header if BFD control packet
   transmitted by the head using IP/UDP encapsulation as described in
   Section 3.1.  Non-IP encapsulation case described in Section 3.2.

3.1.  IP Encapsulation of Multipoint BFD

   [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint] defines IP/UDP encapsulation for multipoint
   BFD over p2mp MPLS LSP:

      UDP destination port MUST be set to 3784;

      destination IP address MUST be from the 127/8 range for IPv4 and
      from the 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range for IPv6;

   This specification further clarifies that:

      if multiple alternative paths for the given p2mp LSP Forwarding
      Equivalence Class(FEC) exist, the MultipointHead SHOULD use
      Entropy Label [RFC6790] used for LSP Ping [RFC8029] to exercise
      that particular alternative path;

      or the MultipointHead MAY use, as destination IP address, the IP
      address discovered by LSP Ping traceroute [RFC8029] to exercise
      that particular alternate path.

3.2.  Non-IP Encapsulation of Multipoint BFD

   Non-IP encapsulation for multipoint BFD over p2mp MPLS LSP MUST use
   Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Label (GAL) [RFC5586] at the
   bottom of the label stack followed by Associated Channel Header
   (ACH).  Channel Type field in ACH MUST be set to BFD CV [RFC6428].
   To provide the identity of the MultipointHead for the particular
   multipoint BFD session this document defines new Source MEP ID IP
   Address type (TBA1) in Section 6.1.  If the Length value is 4, then
   the Value field contains an IPv4 address.  If the Length value is 16,
   then the Value field contains an IPv6 address.  Any other value of
   the Length field MUST be considered as an error, and the BFD control
   packet MUST be discarded.

4.  Bootstrapping Multipoint BFD

4.1.  LSP Ping

   MaultipointHead MAY use LSP Ping [RFC8029] using in Target FEC TLV,
   as appropriate, sub-TLVs defined in Section 3.1 [RFC6425].

4.2.  Control Plane

   BGP-BFD Attribute [I-D.ietf-bess-mvpn-fast-failover] MAY be used to
   bootstrap multipoint BFD session on a tail.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security aspects but inherits
   all security considerations from [RFC5880], [RFC5884], [RFC7726],
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint], [RFC8029], and [RFC6425].

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Source MEP ID IP Address Type

   IANA is required to allocate value (TBD) for the Source MEP ID IP
   Address type from the "CC/CV MEP-ID TLV" registry which is under the
   "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types" registry.
