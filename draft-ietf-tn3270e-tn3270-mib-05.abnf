length = one-octet length of the data portion of the
                   trace element, not including the length and
                   type octets

type   = one-octet code point characterizing the data;
                   defined values are:

                   X'01' outbound telnet PDU to the client
                   X'02' inbound telnet PDU from the client
                   X'03' outbound SNA data to the host
                   X'04' inbound SNA data from the host

data   = initial part of a PDU.

length    = one-octet length of the data portion of the
                  trace element, not including the length,
                  type, and TimeStamp fields
type      = one-octet code point characterizing the data.
TimeStamp = A 4 octet field that follows the TimeStamp
                  (TimeTicks) textual convention as defined
                  by RFC 1903.
data      = initial part of a PDU.
