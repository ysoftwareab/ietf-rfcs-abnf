Abstract

   This document provides an overview of the attribute types and object
   classes defined by the ISO/IEC JTC1 and ITU-T committees in the 
   IS0/IEC 9594 and X.500 documents, in particular those intended for 
   use by directory clients.  This is the most widely used schema for 
   LDAP/X.500 directories, and many other schema definitions for white 
   pages objects use it as a basis.  This document does not cover 
   attributes used for the administration of X.500 directory servers, 
   nor does it include attributes defined by other ISO/ITU-T documents.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6].

1. General Issues

   This document references syntaxes given in section 3 of [1].  
   Matching rules are listed in section 4 of [1].

   The attribute type and object class definitions are written using the
   BNF form of AttributeTypeDescription and ObjectClassDescription given
   in [1].  Lines have been folded for readability.


2. Source

   The schema definitions in this document are based on those found in
   X.500 [2], [3], [4], and [5], specifically:

   Three new attributes:  supportedAlgorithms, deltaRevocationList and 
   dmdName, and the new objectClass dmd, which were not specified in 
   X.500 edition 2 (1993), are defined in the X.500 edition 3 (1997)[2, 
   3, 4, 5] documents.  
   [Editor's note:  Should these items be removed so that they are not 
   bringing in a second set of X.500 references.  Perhaps they could be 
   put into a non-normative annex with reference to the later X.500 
   edition.  End editor's note.]

3. Attribute Types

   The attribute types contained in this section hold user information.

   An LDAP server implementation MUST recognize the objectClass 
   attribute type.

   There is no requirement that servers implement the following 
   attribute types: 

       knowledgeInformation
       searchGuide
       teletexTerminalIdentifier

   In fact, their use is greatly discouraged.

4.  Object Classes

   LDAP servers MUST recognize the object class "top".  LDAP servers 
   SHOULD recognize all the other object classes listed here as values 
   of the objectClass attribute.

4.1  alias

   The alias object class enables more than one Distinguished Name to 
   designate an entry by providing an alias entry.  The alias entry 
   contains a pointer to the other entry.  The pointer is automatically 
   followed when the alias entry is found in the process of locating 
   the target entry(s) of an operation.

   The applicationEntity object class definition is the basis of an 
   entry which represents the interconnection aspects of an application 
   process in a distributed environment.

5.  Security Considerations

   Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive 
   information about the real-world objects they represent, which can be
   people, organizations or devices.  Most countries have privacy laws 
   regarding the publication of information about people.

   Transfer of cleartext passwords is strongly discouraged where the 
   underlying transport service cannot guarantee confidentiality and may
   result in disclosure of the password to unauthorized parties.

   It is required that strong authentication be performed in order to 
   modify directory entries using LDAP.

                          Annex A  Change Log


   This annex lists the changes that have been made from RFC 2256 to 
   this I-D.  

   Changes to RFC 2256 resulting in 
   draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-00.txt:

      1.  Revision of the Status of this Memo.

      2.  Dependencies on RFC 1274 have been eliminated.

      3.  The references to X.500(96) have been expressed in terms of 
          the "edition", rather than the standard date.  Note that the 
          version of X.500 which is the basis for this document, is the 
          third edition, which was finalized in 1996, but approved in 
          1997.

      4.  The "teletexTerminalNumber" attribute and syntax are marked 
          as obsolete.

      5.  Removed "The syntax definitions are based on the ISODE "QUIPU"
          implementation of X.500." from section 6.

      6.  Added text to 6.1, the octetString syntax, in accordance 
          with X.520.

      7.  Some of the attribute types MUST be recognized by servers.  
          Also, several attributes are obsolete.  Therefore, the 
          various kinds of attribute types have been placed in separate 
          sections:

            - necessary for the directory to operate (section 3.1) 

            - for holding user information (section 3.2) 

            - superseded or withdrawn (section 3.3).  

      8.  Since "top" may be implicitly specified and  "alias" is not 
          abstract, the last sentence in the description of the 
          "objectClass" attribute type, section 3.1.1, has been deleted.
          The clause that preceded the deleted sentence has been 
          removed, also.

      9.  Add a description to the definition of the "telephoneNumber" 
          attribute type, section 3.2.17.

      10. Add text to mark the "teletexTerminalIdentifier" attribute 
          type as obsolete.

INTERNET-DRAFT      draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-01   20 November 2001


      11. Add a security consideration requiring strong authentication 
          in order to modify directory entries.

   Changes to draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-00.txt, resulting in draft-
   ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-01.txt:
 
      12. Delete the conformance requirement for subschema object 
          classes in favor of a statement in [1].

      13. Add a Table of Contents

      14. Replace the term "obsolete" with "superseded or withdrawn" 

      15. Added explanations to many attributes.

      16. In the title, correct the X.500 reference to have the second 
          edition as the basis.

      17. Throughout this I-D, cleaned up whitespace in the BNF 
          definitions.

      18. Removed Section 4, Syntaxes, and Section 6, Matching Rules, 
          (moved to draft-ietf-ldapbis-syntaxes-01.txt).

      19. Reorganized Section 3, Attributes, to eliminate grouping 
          attributes according to conformance requirements.  Reordered 
          Section 3, Attributes, and Section 4, Object Classes, 
          alphabetically.

      20. Added an explanation for each object class.
