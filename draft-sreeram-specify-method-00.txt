Abstract

   This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP).  This extension adds the SPECIFY method to the SIP
   protocol.  The intent of the SPECIFY method is to allow conveying SIP
   entity's (Proxy, User Agent, Redirect Server) intention of
   asynchronous service change (i.e. to be taken out of service or has
   just return to service) with and with out a backup SIP entity within
   the same administrative domain.

1.  Introduction

   A SIP proxy server handles multiple subscribers.  It is important 
   that a backup server is available so that an active server can be 
   temporarily taken out of service for maintenance.  There are
   multiple ways backup proxy servers can be used to minimize the
   service disruption.

   A relatively simple way to support proxy redundancy (i.e. backup
   proxy) is to configure a static list of SIP proxy servers in the
   configuration profile where the list is arranged in some order of
   priority.  The subscriber will attempt to contact the proxy server in
   the order of priority.

   But the dynamic nature of SIP message routing makes the use of a
   static list of proxy servers inadequate in certain scenarios.

      For instance, if SIP user agents are served by different domains,
      it would not be feasible to configure one static list of proxy
      servers per covered domain by the subscriber.

   One solution to get around this problem is through the use DNS SRV
   records.  The subscriber can be instructed to contact a SIP proxy
   server in a domain named in SIP messages.  The subscriber shall
   consult the DNS server to get a list of hosts in the given domain
   that provides SIP services.  If an entry exists, the DNS server will
   return a SRV record which contains a list of SIP proxy servers for
   the domain, with their host names, priority, listening ports, etc.
   The SIP entity shall try to contact the list of hosts in the order of
   their stated priority.

   But this is not always the case because all proxies may not have a
   backup proxy.  Also in some cases based on the load and other
   factors, the network operator(s) may change the proxy dynamically
   which may not reflect in the DNS SRV records.

   The problem when the proxy with out backup fails is more realistic in
   SIP than it is in other transactional protocols.  The reason for this
   is some SIP responses can take a long time to be generated, because a
   human intervention in order to generate a acceptable response.  So,
   it is common for tens of seconds to elapse between a call request and
   its acceptance.

   This document highlights the problems and solution for the cases
   where a SIP entity goes for an asynchronous service change (e.g.
   restart, disconnect, overload) with and with out a backup SIP entity.

   On restart/disconnect of a SIP entity with backup, there should be a

Internet-Draft     draft-sreeram-sip-specify-method-00.txt   October 2006


   graceful way of taking down the transient calls.  Generally in
   softswitches/traditional switches (typically acting as a multi-line
   SIP User Agent), the back up of the active call data will be taken
   only when the call is established (i.e. talking state) and not when
   the call is in transient state.  On restart/disconnect the active
   calls will recover, whereas the calls in transient state will remain,
   until some protocol timer gets expired which eventually clean-up the
   call related resources.

   Similarly, on restart/disconnect of a SIP entity without backup, the
   same problem exists and there is no way by which SIP entity that is
   restarting/disconnecting can inform about the alternative IP address
   (if available) to other SIP entities to which it can communicate so
   that graceful handling of existing sessions (or calls) or future
   sessions can be performed using alternate IP address.

   Unlike other network protocols (SS7, H.323), SIP has not defined
   procedures for handling device failure.  If a SIP entity fails, the
   other SIP entity detects this through timer expiration leading to
   long delays in call establishment.

   Also, there is no standardized mechanism by which a SIP entity can
   inform other SIP entities to which it can communicate, about
   intention of service change (i.e. to be taken out of service or has
   just return to service) asynchronously.  This document proposes an
   extension to the Session Initiation Protocol to provide a mechanism
   for asynchronous service change notification within the same
   administrative domain.  If the method described in the draft used
   along with existing mechanism of service discovery provides a better
   method for controlling the services.

     


2.  Sample Use Cases

2.1.  When Proxy's fail in the middle of a transaction

   It is possible for elements to fail in the middle of a transaction.

   For example, after Proxy 2 forwards the request to UA 2, Proxy 1
   fails.  UA 2 sends its response to Proxy 2, which tries to forward it
   to Proxy 1, which is no longer available.  UA 2 tries to resend the
   response until the timer expires as Proxy 2 is not aware that Proxy 1
   is no longer available.

2.2.  In the PSTN-SIP inter working using SIP-T/SIP

   When the originating office SIP-T MGC (acting a multi-line SIP UA)
   has originating a call which is in alerting state, a restart of the
   MGC tears down the originating side of the call but not the
   terminating side.  The reverse is true when the terminator is
   restarted.  The terminating side of the call is torn down but not the
   originating side.  The call will terminate only after the protocol
   time out.  (This problem is applicable only for the transient calls)

2.3.  SIPT used between PSTN-PSTN (PSTN-SIPT-PSTN)

   There will be a limit to the number of simultaneous calls that can be
   made using SIP-T (or) on proxy.  There should be some way to inform
   the other side that the maximum numbers of calls it can handle has
   reached to prevent call failures because of overloading.

2.4.  Essential proxy

   Essential proxy is a proxy which need to be inserted for all the
   outgoing and incoming requests to a particular domain.

   In the below call flow

   UA1--SIP GW--P1--P2--P3--UA2

   SIP GW is a sip gateway for the UA1.  P2 is the Essential proxy which
   need to be inserted for all the outgoing and incoming Requests coming
   from UA1 All the calls coming out of P1 will have the P2 inserted in
   the route.  If there is no backup for Proxy P2, on Disconnecting P1
   should be informed that another Proxy P4 is available in the network
   which does the opertions of P2.

   There is no exsisting mechanism which can do this.

3.  SPECIFY Method

3.1.  Motivation of a new method

   The INVITE method of SIP protocol helps in establishing voice calls
   between SIP user agents.  Also the SIP INFO helps in carrying
   application level information along the SIP signaling path during a
   SIP Session and SIP MESSAGE method sends an instant message to remote
   UA.  NOTIFY mechanism is used for asynchronous (but solicited)
   notification of events requested (SUBSCRIBED) by the other SIP entity
   only.  Since none of the existing methods provide the intended
   functionality, we are proposing a NEW method which provides that
   functionality.

   Using SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY mechanism for this problem is very expensive
   because it needs to have N x N subscriptions.  Both the entities
   should maintain the subscription states for this new event.  It
   should be the originator's responsibility to intimate others about
   the change of state and not be on request as with SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY.
   This is an unsolicited request.

   None of these existing methods fulfill the requirement of conveying
   SIP Entity' intention of service change.  Hence "SPECIFY" has been
   introduced.

   "SPECIFY" is a SIP method as defined by RFC 3261.  "SPECIFY" will be
   hop to hop.  The SPECIFY method indicates that the initiator of
   SPECIFY is changing (or has changed) its state.  SPECIFY method
   follows the semantics of OPTIONS mechanism.

   SPECIFY can be used either between a proxy to proxy and proxy to UA
   or UA to UA.  "SPECIFY" can be used before taken out of service or
   after return to service.

   A SPECIFY request does not establish a dialog.The Record-Route header
   field has no meaning in SPECIFY requests or responses, and MUST be
   ignored if present.  In particular, the SIP entity MUST NOT create a
   new route set based on the presence or absence of a Record-Route
   header field in any response to a SPECIFY request.

3.2.  Condition Header

   There is no SIP header, through which the service change reason of
   the SIP entity can be informed.  So the "condition" header is
   introduced.

   Condition header can have the following possible values:

   a.  Graceful - indicates that the entity that has sent "SPECIFY" will
       be taken out of service after the specified time; established




Kanumuri & Sarkar       Expires April 16, 2007               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     draft-sreeram-sip-specify-method-00.txt   October 2006


       connections are not yet affected, but the notifier should refrain
       from establishing new connections and should attempt to
       gracefully tear down existing connections on the initiator
       affected by the "SPECIFY" Request.  (This is a case of
       disconnect.)

   b.  Forced - indicates that the entity was taken abruptly out of
       service and any established connection associated with them may
       be lost.  The notifier is responsible for cleaning up the
       connections (if any) with which the initiator of the "SPECIFY" is
       associated.  In this case "SPECIFY" MAY be used after the entity
       is back to service.  (This is a "Restart" case)

          Trigger to sent out a SPECIFY after a disconnect or restart
          case is implementation dependent and is outside the scope of
          this document.

   c.  Failover - indicate the primary SIP entity is out of service and
       a secondary SIP entity is taking over.  In the case, where there
       is no secondary SIP entity, the primary SIP entity will behave as
       that of a "graceful" condition.

   d.  Overload - indicates the entity's overloaded condition;
       established connections are not affected, but the notifier should
       refrain from establishing new connections

      A condition header parameter "cleared" is introduced for overload
      condition to indicate that the overload condition is cleared.

   This table expands on tables 2 and 3 in SIP RFC 3261 [RFC3261], as
   amended by the changes described in section 7.1.

   Header field      where proxy ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG PRA SUB NOT SPY
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Condition           R          -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   m

3.3.  Contact Header

   There is no SIP header which can inform the "optional IP address"
   that is used for subsequent messages when the active SIP entity is
   out of service.  Alternatively, we suggest using the existing
   "Contact" Header.

   In the SPECIFY method, if the Contact header is present it gives the
   address of the alternative (backup) SIP entity that will be used in
   subsequent messages.  There can be multiple contact addresses in the
   SPECIFY request.  If more than one Contact is sent in a SPECIFY
   request, the list can be prioritized with the "q" parameter in the




Kanumuri & Sarkar       Expires April 16, 2007               [Page 8]
Internet-Draft     draft-sreeram-sip-specify-method-00.txt   October 2006


   Contact header field.  The "q" parameter indicates a relative
   preference for the particular Contact header field value compared to
   other.

   The entity receiving the SPECIFY method, not having the Contact
   header means all the calls that are related to the entity that
   initiated SPECIFY should be taken down (Assuming that when there is
   no Contact header, there is no back up for that entity).

   Similarly, the entity on receiving the SPECIFY method having the
   Contact header(s) MAY take down the transient calls.

   The only exception is in case of overload condition, where the entity
   receiving the SPECIFY method, not having the Contact header indicates
   no new connections should be made to the entity that initiated
   SPECIFY unless the overload condition is cleared and having the
   Contact header(s) indicates new connections will be routed to the
   alternate IP address.

   This table expands on tables 2 and 3 in SIP RFC 3261 [RFC3261], as
   amended by the changes described in section 7.1.

   Header field      where proxy ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG PRA SUB NOT SPY
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Contact             R          o   -   -   m   o   o   -   m   m   o

      Bringing down the transient calls when SPECIFY is having Contact
      header is implementation dependent.

   For instance, having the proxy with backup of transient calls, using
   CONTACT header all the calls can be routed to that new IP address.

3.4.  Timer Header

   This header indicates the time in seconds after which the entity that
   have sent the SPECIFY method will change its state.

   The SPECIFY method MUST have the Date header, when the Timer header
   is present.

   When the entity receives a SPECIFY, it computes the Time at which the
   entity that has sent the SPECIFY will change its state using the
   Timer and Date headers.

   The value of Timer field is an integral number of seconds (in
   decimal) between 0 and (2**32)-1.

   This table expands on tables 2 and 3 in SIP RFC 3261 [RFC3261], as

   amended by the changes described in section 7.1.

   Header field      where proxy ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG PRA SUB NOT SPY

   Timer               R          -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   o

   Note: The Expires header defined in RFC 3261 [RFC3261] can also be
   used BUT with overloading its existing meaning.  This is still open.

   The Default value of Timer is 3600 seconds

3.5.  Message Body Inclusion

   The SPECIFY request MAY contain a message body.

   The definition of the message bodies is outside the scope of this
   document.


4.  SPECIFY Handling

4.1.  Sending a SPECIFY

   Unless stated otherwise, the protocol rules for the SPECIFY request
   governing the usage of tags, retransmission and reliability, CSeq
   incrementing and message formatting follow those in RFC 3261
   [RFC3261] as defined for the OPTIONS request.

   When the SIP entity is going for a Graceful disconnect and have no
   back-up server, it sends a SPECIFY with

      - Condition: Graceful
      - Timer and Date headers at what time it goes for Graceful
      disconnect, and
      - No Contact header

   When the SIP entity is going for a Graceful disconnect and want to
   route all the calls to some other (i.e. backup or alternate route)
   proxy(s), it sends SPECIFY with

      - Condition: Graceful
      - Contact header(s) with backup or alternate route proxy(s)
      information

   When the SIP entity is going for a Failover (Changing from active to
   inactive pair), it sends SPECIFY with

      - Condition: Failover

   When the SIP entity recovers from a service disruption (i.e. proxy is

   When the SIP entity is going for an overload condition, it sends a
   SPECIFY with

      - Condition: Overload
      - Contact header(s) with alternate route information

   When the SIP entity is clearing an overload condition, it sends a
   SPECIFY with

      - Condition: Overload;cleared

      The list of sip entities that need to be send the SPECIFY request
      on a service change is beyond the scope of this document.  It is
      up the implementation to decide to whom this Request is to be sent.

4.2.  Receiving a SPECIFY

   The response to a SPECIFY is constructed using the standard rules for
   a SIP response as described in Section 8.2.6 in RFC 3261 [RFC3261]

   The SIP entity on receiving the SPECIFY (with Condition: Graceful and
   no contact header) will bring down all the transient calls and active
   calls at the mentioned time.

   The SIP entity on receiving the SPECIFY (with Condition: Graceful and
   contact header with alternate routes) will bring down all the
   transient calls and active calls and updates its SERV records in DNS
   with the new address as indicated in the contact header.

   The SIP entity on receiving the SPECIFY (with Condition: Failover)
   will bring down all the transient calls immediately.  In general in
   soft switches, the transient call details will not be backed up.

   The SIP entity on receiving the SPECIFY (with Condition: Forced) will
   update the DNS record with proxy's IP address.

   The SIP entity on receiving the SPECIFY (with Condition: Overload and
   no contact header) should restrict itself form initiating any new
   connections to overloaded SIP entity.

   The SIP entity on receiving the SPECIFY (with Condition: Overload and
   contact header) should restrict itself for initiating any new

   connections to overloaded SIP entity and updates its SERV records in
   DNS with the new address as indicate in the alternate incase of the
   current proxy.

   If a proxy receives a SPECIFY request it MUST send a final response
   following non-INVITE transaction state machine rules.

   A 200 OK response MUST be sent by a proxy for a SPECIFY request if
   the SPECIFY request was successfully handled.

   Other request failure (4xx) responses MAY be sent for the SPECIFY
   Request.
