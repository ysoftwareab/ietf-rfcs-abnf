Abstract

This document describes a metric for network performance. This
metric is based on the time difference of a continuous packet pair
which are sent back-to-back from the source IP address to the
destination IP address. The basic packet pair probing can be used to
measure the capacity of a end-to-end path.

Internet-Draft             Packet Pair Gap Metrics            June 2011


1. Introduction

This memo defines a metric for time difference between 'back-to-
back' IP Packet Pair on end-to-end network paths. It builds on the
notions and conventions introduced in the IP Performance Metric
(IPPM) framework [RFC2330].

Active end-to-end probing techniques, where probe packets are
injected into network, are widely used in network measurement system.
There are two primary classes: the one-packet methods and the packet
pair family. The one-packet methods are based on the assumption that
the transmission delay is proportional to the probe packet size.
This idea was first introduced by V. Jacobson in his tool "pathchar".
The packet pair family is based on the fact that the minimum inter-
departure time of consecutive packets is attained when they are
back-to-back. The basic packet pair probing can be used to measure
the capacity of a end-to-end network path, i.e. the bottleneck
bandwidth. First of all, there is no background traffic at the link.
The source sends multiple packet pairs to the receiver. Each packet
pair consists of two packets of the same size and is sent back to
back. The receiver can obtain the dispersion of a packet pair by
calculating the time distance between the last bit of each packet.
With this dispersion, the path capacity can be obtained. When there
is background traffic, the available bandwidth and the path capacity
can still be measured using packet pair method. To decrease the
influence of the background traffic, the packet train technique,
which is based on packet pair technique, is used. The source sends
multiple back-to-back probe packets to the receiver. The dispersion
of this packet train is the time distance between the first packet
and the last one. There are still several improved methods of packet
pair probing technique, such as packet quartets which combines two
packet pairs and so on. With the capability of estimating the path
capacity and available bandwidth as referred above, they can also be
used to observe the changes of network stated in order to control
the flow rate properly, to measure the network loss, to avoid
network congestion, to estimate the network delay, even to measure
the link quality in wireless networks and so on. In this draft, we
simply define the basic packet pair model.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Terminology

Terms used in this document that are defined in the Terminology
section of the IPPM Protocol [RFC2330] document are to be
interpreted as defined there.

IP packet One-way-delay and IP packet delay variation are defined in
RFC2679 and RFC3393. Metric here originates from a more special send
method from the source addresses, and it was used in RFC2544 to
describe the frames used to do equipment test.

Here we use back-to-back packet in IP level, and define IP type-P
back-to-back packet group similarly in the following: IP Type-P
packets presented at a rate such that there is the minimum legal
separation for a given medium between type-P packets over a short to
medium period of time, starting from an idle state.

In addition, this document defines the following terms

IP Type-P back-to-back packet pair: An IP type-P back-to-back packet
group has 2 packets as its members.

Pgap: The time difference of arrival times of two packets which are
sent back-to-back from the same source at the measurement point.

3. A singleton definition of pgap

In this section, we specify definitions for IP type P back-to-back
packet pair gap (pgap). It is the time difference of arrival times
of two packets which are sent back-to-back from the same source at
the measurement point.

3.1. Metric Parameters

+ Src, the IP address of a host

+ Dst, the IP address of a host

+ MP, the measure point

+ T1, a time

+ T2, a time

+ L, a packet length in bits. The packets of a Type P packet pair
MUST be of the same length.

+ P, the specification of the packet type, over and above the source
and destination addresses.

Internet-Draft             Packet Pair Gap Metrics            June 2011



3.2. Metric Unit

The value of a IP Type-P back to back packet pair gap time is either
a real number of seconds (positive, zero, negative) or an undefined
number of seconds.

3.3. Definition

We are given a Type P packet pair, and they are sent from the Src in
back-to-back way. T1 is the wire-time at which the measure point or
Dst received the first packet of the Type P packet pair. T2 is the
wire-time at which measure point or Dst received the latter packet
of the Type P packet pair. Therefore the time difference between T1
and T2 is value of our metric. So Pgap = T2 - T1.

The Type P Pgap from Src to Dst is "undefined" means that Src sent
Type P packet pair in back-to-back way and that Dst did not receive
one or both packets.

3.4. Discussion

There are some practical issues to be considered.

+ This metric is less sensitive to clock synchronization problems.

The metric definition depends on the IP Type P back-to-back packet
pair that has been measured. They SHOULD be consecutive packets with
no time interval from one source and heading for the same
destination.

Being a differential measurement and use the same clock at the MP or
Dst, this metric is has barely nothing to do with clock
synchronization problem.

In [RFC2330], "skew" is defined as derivative of the offset of a
clock with respect to "true time" and "drift" as the second
derivative of the offset of a clock with respect to "true time".

Since in this metric, only one clock is used here, and discussion of
"relative skew" and "relative drift" between two clocks is needless.

NOTE: The drift of a clock, as it is above defined over a long
period must have an average value that trends to zero while the
period becomes large since the frequency of the clock has a finite
(and small) range. In order to underline the order of magnitude of
this effect, it is considered that the maximum range of drift for
commercial crystals is about 50 part per million (ppm). Since it is
mainly connected with variations in operating temperature (from 0 to


Cheng, et al             Expires December 22, 2011             [Page 6]

70 degrees Celsius), it is expected that a host will have nearly
constant temperature during its operation period, and variations in
temperature, even if quick, could be less than one Celsius per
second, and range in the order of a few degrees. The total range of
the drift is usually related to variations from 0 to 70 Celsius.
There are important points for evaluation of precisions of our
measurement.

+ A methodology will have to include a way to determine whether a
delay value is infinite or whether it is merely very large (and the
packet is yet to arrive at Dst). As noted by Mahdavi and Paxson,
simple upper bounds (such as the 255 seconds theoretical upper bound
on the lifetimes of IP packets [Postel: RFC 791]) could be used, but
good engineering, including an understanding of packet lifetimes,
will be needed in practice.

Comment: Note that, for many applications of these metrics, the harm
in treating a large delay as infinite might be zero or very small. A
TCP data packet, for example, that arrives only after several
multiples of the RTT may as well have been lost

+ As with other 'Type-P' metrics, the value of the metric may depend
on such properties of packet as protocol, (UDP or TCP) port number,
size, and arrangements for special treatment (as with IP precedence
or with RSVP)

+ If the packet is duplicated along the path (or paths) so that
multiple no-corrupt copies arrive at the destination, then the
packet is counted as received, and the first copy to arrive
determines the packets' pgap.

+ If the packet is fragmented and if, for whatever reason,
reassembly does not occur, and then the packet will be deemed lost.


4. Definition of pgap variation

4.1. Metric name

In this section, we specify definitions of IP type P back-to-back
packet pair gap variation (pgapv).

4.2. Metric parameters

+ Src, the IP address of a host

+ Dst, the IP address of a host

+ MP, the measure point


Cheng, et al             Expires December 22, 2011             [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             Packet Pair Gap Metrics            June 2011



+ T1, T2, T3, T4, times

+ L, a packet length in bits. The packets of a Type P packet pair
MUST be of the same length.

+ P, the specification of the packet type, over and above the source
and destination addresses.

+ F, a selection function defining unambiguously the two back-to-
back packet pairs from the packet pair stream selected for the
metric.

+ I1, I2, times which mark that beginning and ending of the interval
in which the packet pair stream from which the singleton measurement
is taken occurs.

4.3. Metric Unit

The value of a Type-P pgapv is either a real number of seconds
(positive, zero or negative) or an undefined number of seconds.

4.4. Definition

Given a Type P back-to-back packet stream and I1 and I2 such that
the first Type P packet pair to pass measurement point MP1 after I1
is give index 0 and the last Type P packet to pass measurement point
MP1 before I2 is given the highest index number.

Type-P back-to-back IP packet pair gap variation is defined for two
packet pairs from Src to Dst selected by the selection function F,
as the difference between the value of the Type-P back-to-back IP
packet pair gap from Src to Dst and the value of the Type-P back-to-
back IP packet pair gap from Src to Dst. T1 and T2 are the wire-time
of first packet and last packet in  first Type-P packet pair. T3 and
T4 are the wire-time of first packet and last packet in the second
Type-P packet pair.

Therefore, for a real number dT "the Type-P back-to-back IP packet
pair gap variation from Src to Dst at T1, T2, T3, T4 is dT" means
that Src send two packet pairs, the first packet in first packet
pair was received at wire-time T1 (first bit), and second at wire-
time T2 (first bit) and the first packet in second packet pair was
received at wire-time T3(first bit) and the second at wire-time T4
(first bit), and that dT=(T4-T3)-(T2-T1).

"The Type-P back-to-back packet pair gap variation from Src to Des
at T1, T2, T3, T4 is undefined" means that Src sent the two IP
packet pairs but the Dst did not receive all packets.

4.5. Discussion

The metric definition depends on a stream of Type-P back-to-back IP
packet pairs that have been measured. In general this can be a
stream of two or more back-to-back IP packet pairs, delimited by the
interval endpoints I1 and I2. There must be a stream of at least two
packet pairs in order for a singleton pgapv to take place. The
purpose of the selection function is to specify exactly which two
packet pairs from the stream are to be used for the singleton
measurement.

In this document it is assumed that the Type-P packet pair stream is
generated according to the Poisson sampling methodology described in
[RFC2330].

The reason for Poisson sampling is that it ensures an unbiased and
uniformly distributed sampling of times between I1 and I2. However,
alternate sampling methodologies are possible.


5. Security Considerations

This metric has the same security properties as the one-way-delay
metric [RFC2679], and thus they inherit the consideration of that
document. The reader should consult [RFC2679] for a more detailed
treatment of security considerations. Nevertheless, there are a few
things to highlight.

5.1. Denial-of-Service Attacks

It is still possible that there could be an attempt at a denial of
service attack by sending many measurement packets into the network.
In general, legitimate measurement must have their parameters
carefully selected in order to avoid interfering with normal traffic.

5.2. Privacy/Confidentiality

The packets contain no user information, and so privacy of user data
is not a concern.

5.3. Integrity

There could also be attempts to disrupt measurements by diverting
packets or corrupting them. To ensure that test packets are valid
and have not been altered during transit, packet authentication and
integrity checks may be used.
