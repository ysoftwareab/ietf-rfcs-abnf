1.  Introduction

   The Softwires Working Group has selected Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
   version 2 (L2TPv2) as the phase 1 protocol to be deployed in the
   Softwires "Hubs and Spokes" solution space.  This document describes
   the framework for the L2TPv2 "Hubs and Spokes" solution, and the
   implementation details specified in this document should be followed
   to achieve interoperability among different vendor implementations.

   In the "Hubs and Spokes" solution space, a Softwire is established to
   provide the home network with IPv4 connectivity across an IPv6-only
   access network or IPv6 connectivity across an IPv4-only access
   network.  When L2TPv2 is used in the Softwire context, the voluntary
   tunneling model applies.  The Softwire Initiator (SI) at the home
   network takes the role of the L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) client
   (initiating both the L2TP tunnel/session and PPP link) while the
   Softwire Concentrator (SC) at the ISP takes the role of the L2TP
   Network Server (LNS).  Since L2TPv2 compulsory tunneling model does
   not apply to Softwires, it should not be requested or honored.  This
   document identifies all the voluntary tunneling related L2TPv2
   attributes that apply to Softwires and specifies the handling
   mechanism for such attributes in order to avoid ambiguities in
   implementations.  This document also identifies the set of L2TPv2
   attributes specific to compulsory tunneling model that do not apply
   to Softwires and specifies the mechanism to ignore or nullify their
   effect within the Softwires context.

   The SI and SC must follow the L2TPv2 operations described in
   [RFC2661] when performing Softwire establishment, tear-down and OAM.
   With L2TPv2, a Softwire consists of an L2TPv2 Control Channel, a
   single Session, and the PPP link negotiated over the Session.  To
   establish the Softwire, the SI first initiates an L2TPv2 Control
   Channel to the SC which accepts the request and terminates the
   Control Channel.  L2TPv2 supports an optional mutual Control Channel
   authentication which allows both SI and SC to validate each other's
   identity at the initial phase of hand-shaking before proceeding with
   Control Channel establishment.  After the L2TPv2 Control Channel is
   established between the SI and SC, the SI initiates an L2TPv2 Session
   to the SC.  Then the PPP/IP link is negotiated over the L2TPv2
   Session between the SI and SC.  After the PPP/IP link is established,
   it acts as the Softwire between the SI and SC for tunneling IP
   traffic of one Address Family across the access network of another
   Address Family.

   During the life of the Softwire, both SI and SC may send L2TPv2
   keepalive HELLO messages to monitor the health of the Softwire and
   the peer LCCE or to refresh the NAT/PAT translation entry at the CPE
   or at the other end of the access link.  In the event of keepalive

   timeout or administrative shutdown of the Softwire, either SI or SC
   may tear down the Softwire by tearing down the L2TPv2 Control Channel
   and Session as specified in [RFC2661].

2.  Applicability of L2TPv2 for Softwire Requirements

   A list of Softwire "Hubs and Spokes" requirements have been
   identified by the Softwire Problem Statement
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-problem-statement].  The following section
   describes how L2TPv2 fulfills each of them.

2.1.  Network and Port Address Translation (NAT/PAT)

   A "Hubs and Spokes" Softwire must be able to traverse NAT/PAT in case
   the scenario in question involves a non-upgradable pre-existing IPv4
   home gateway performing NAT/PAT or some carrier equipment at the
   other end of the access link performing NAT/PAT.  The L2TPv2 Softwire
   (i.e.  Control Channel and Session) is capable of NAT/PAT traversal
   since L2TPv2 can run over UDP.

   Since L2TPv2 does not "autodetect" NAT/PAT along the path, L2TPv2
   does not offer UDP bypass regardless of NAT/PAT presence.  Both NAT/
   PAT "autodetect" and UDP bypass are optional requirements.

2.2.  Scalability

   In the "Hubs and Spokes" model, a carrier must be able to scale the
   solution to millions of Softwire initiators by adding more hubs (i.e.
   Softwire concentrators).  L2TPv2 is a widely deployed protocol in
   broadband services, and its scalability has been proven in multiple
   large-scale IPv4 Virtual Private Network deployments which scale up
   to millions of subscribers each.

2.3.  Multicast

   Multicast protocols simply run over L2TPv2 Softwires transparently
   together with other regular IP traffic.

2.4.  Authentication, Authorization and Accounting

   L2TPv2 supports optional mutual Control Channel authentication and
   leverages the optional mutual PPP per-session authentication.  L2TPv2
   is well integrated with AAA solutions (such as RADIUS) for both
   authentication and authorization.  Most L2TPv2 implementations
   available in the market support logging of authentication and
   authorization events.

   L2TPv2 integration with RADIUS accounting (RADIUS Accounting
   extension for tunnel [RFC2867]) allows the collection and reporting
   of L2TPv2 Softwire usage statistics.

Internet-Draft    Softwires H & S Framework with L2TPv2    November 2006


2.5.  Privacy, Integrity, and Replay Protection

   Since L2TPv2 runs over IP/UDP in the Softwire context, IPSec ESP can
   be used in conjunction to provide per-packet authentication,
   integrity, replay protection and confidentiality for both L2TPv2
   control and data traffic [RFC3193] and [RFC3948].

   For Softwire deployments in which full payload security is not
   required, the L2TPv2 built-in Control Channel authentication and the
   inherited PPP authentication and PPP Encryption Control Protocol can
   be considered.

2.6.  Operations and Management (OAM)

   L2TPv2 supports an optional in-band keepalive mechanism which injects
   HELLO control messages after a specified period of time has elapsed
   since the last data or control message was received on a tunnel.  If
   the HELLO control message is not reliably delivered, then the Control
   Channel and its session will be torn down.  In the Softwire context,
   the L2TPv2 keepalive can be used to monitor connectivity status
   between the SI and SC and/or as a refresh mechanism for any NAT/PAT
   translation entry along the access link.

   L2TPv2 MIB [RFC3371] supports the complete suite of management
   operations such as configuration of Control Channel and Session,
   polling of Control Channel and Session status and their traffic
   statistics and notifications of Control Channel and Session UP/DOWN
   events.

2.7.  Encapsulations

   L2TPv2 supports the following encapsulations:

   o  IPv6/PPP/L2TPv2/UDP/IPv4

   o  IPv4/PPP/L2TPv2/UDP/IPv6

   o  IPv4/PPP/L2TPv2/UDP/IPv4

   o  IPv6/PPP/L2TPv2/UDP/IPv6

   Note that UDP bypass is not supported by L2TPv2 since L2TPv2 does not
   support "autodetect" of NAT/PAT.


3.  Deployment Scenarios

   For the "Hubs and Spokes" problem space, four scenarios have been

Internet-Draft    Softwires H & S Framework with L2TPv2    November 2006


   identified.  In each of these four scenarios, different home
   equipment plays the role of the Softwire Initiator.  This section
   elaborates each scenario with L2TPv2 as the Softwire protocol and
   other possible protocols involved to complete the solution.  This
   section examines the four scenarios for both IPv6 over IPv4 and IPv4
   over IPv6 encapsulations.

3.1.  IPv6 over IPv4 Softwire with L2TPv2

   The following subsections cover IPv6 connectivity across an IPv4-only
   access network using a Softwire.

3.1.1.  Host CPE as Softwire Initiator

   Softwire initiator is the host CPE (directly connected to a modem),
   which is dual-stack.  There is no other gateway device.  The IPv4
   traffic should not traverse the softwire.

   In this scenario, IPv6CP negotiates IPv6 over PPP which also provides
   the capability for the ISP to assign the 64-bit Interface Id to the
   host CPE or perform uniqueness validation for the two Interface Ids
   at the two PPP ends [RFC2472].  After IPv6 over PPP is up, Neighbor
   Discovery runs over the IPv6 over PPP link, and the LNS can assign a
   64-bit global prefix to the host CPE via Router Advertisement (RA)
   while other configuration options (such as DNS) can be conveyed to
   the host CPE via DHCPv6/v4.

3.1.2.  Router CPE as Softwire Initiator

   Softwire initiator is the router CPE, which is a dual-stack device.
   The IPv4 traffic should not traverse the Softwire.

   In this scenario, IPv6CP negotiates IPv6 over PPP which also provides
   the capability for the ISP to assign the 64-bit Interface Id to the
   router CPE or perform uniqueness validation for the two Interface Ids
   at the two PPP ends [RFC2472].  After IPv6 over PPP is up, Neighbor
   Discovery runs over the IPv6 over PPP link, and the LNS can assign a
   64-bit global prefix to the router CPE via Router Advertisement (RA).
   DHCPv6 can be used to perform IPv6 Prefix Delegation (e.g. delegating
   a 48-bit prefix to be used within the home network) and convey other
   configuration options (such as DNS) to the router CPE.

3.2.4.  Router behind CPE as Softwire Initiator

   IPv4 connectivity across an IPv6-only access network (STH).  The CPE
   is IPv6-only.  Softwire initiator is a dual-stack device (behind the
   IPv6-only CPE) acting as an IPv4 CPE router inside the home network.
   The IPv6 traffic should not traverse the Softwire.

   In this scenario, IPCP negotiates IPv4 over PPP which also provides
   the capability for the ISP to assign a global IPv4 IP address to the
   v4/v6 router.  Global IPv4 address can also be assigned via DHCP.
   Other configuration options (such as DNS) can be conveyed to the
   v4/v6 router via IPCP [RFC1877] or DHCP.  For IPv4 Prefix Delegation
   for the home network, DHCP [I-D.ietf-dhc-subnet-alloc] can be used.

5.1.  L2TPv2 Tunnel Setup

   L2TPv2 [RFC2661] was originally designed to provide private network
   access to end users connected to a public network.  In the L2TPv2
   model, the end user makes a connection to an L2TP Access Concentrator
   (LAC).  The LAC then initiates an L2TPv2 tunnel to an L2TP Network
   Server (LNS).  The LNS then transfers end user traffic between the
   L2TPv2 tunnel and the private network.

   In the Softwire "Hub and Spoke" model, the Softwire Initiator (SI)
   assumes the role of the LAC and the Softwire Concentrator assumes the

   role of the LNS.

   In the Softwire model, an L2TPv2 packet MUST be carried over UDP.
   The underlying version of the IP protocol may be IPv4 or IPv6,
   depending on the Softwires scenario.

5.1.1.  Tunnel Establishment

   The following diagram, (Figure 11), describes messages exchanged and
   AVPs used to establish a tunnel between an SI (LAC) and an SC (LNS).
   The messages and AVPs described here are only a subset of those
   defined in [RFC2661].  This is because Softwires uses only a subset
   of the L2TPv2 functionality.  One session per tunnel is needed.  Note
   that in the Softwires environment, the SI always initiates the
   tunnel.  No outgoing or analog calls are permitted.  L2TPv2
   attributes SHOULD NOT be hidden.

   In L2TPv2, the tunnel between a LAC and LNS may carry the data of
   multiple users.  Each of these user's is represented by an L2TPv2
   session within the tunnel.  In the Softwires environment, the tunnel
   carries the information of a single user.  So, there is only one
   L2TPv2 session per tunnel.  The following diagram, (Figure 12),
   describes messages exchanged and AVPs used to establish a session
   between an SI (LAC) and an SC (LNS).  The messages and AVPs described

5.1.1.1.  AVPs Required for Softwires

   This paragraph specifies specific values for AVPs used in the
   Softwires context.

   Host Name AVP

      This AVP is mandatory and is present in SCCRQ and SCCRP messages.
      This AVP may be used to authenticate users, in which case it would
      contain a user identification.  If this AVP is not used to
      authenticate users, it may be used for documention.

   Framing Capabilities AVP

      Synchronous bit SHOULD be set to 1 and Asynchronous bit to 1.
      This AVP SHOULD be ignored by the receiver.

   Framing Type AVP

      Synchronous bit SHOULD be set to 1 and Asynchronous bit to 0.
      This AVP SHOULD be ignored by the receiver.

   (Tx) Connect Speed

      (Tx) Connect Speed is a mandatory AVP but is not meaningful in the
      Softwires context.  It SHOULD be left to 0 and ignored by the
      receiver.

   Assigned Tunnel ID, Receive Window Size, Firmware Revision, Vendor

Internet-Draft    Softwires H & S Framework with L2TPv2    November 2006


   Name, Call Serial Number, and Assigned Session ID

      As defined in [RFC2661]

5.1.1.2.  AVPs Optional for Softwires

   Challenge and Challenge Response AVPs

      These AVPs are not required, but are necessary to implement tunnel
      authentication.  Since tunnel authentication happens at the
      beginning of L2TPv2 tunnel creation, it can be helpful in
      preventing DoS attacks.

5.1.1.3.  AVPs not Relevant for Softwires

   L2TPv2 specifies numerous AVPs that, while allowed for a given
   command, are irrelevant to a Softwires.  Softwires implementations
   should not send these AVPs.  However, they should ignore them when
   they are received.  This will make it easier to create Softwires
   applications on top of existing L2TPv2 implementations.

5.1.2.  Tunnel Maintenance

   Periodically, the SI must transit a message to the SC to maintain NAT
   context and detect tunnel failure.  The L2TPv2 HELLO message provides
   a simple, low overhead method of doing this.  However, using the
   default values specified in [RFC2661] could result in a dead end
   detection time of 83 seconds.  If this is not acceptable, LCP Echo
   Request and Reply messages may be used for quicker dead end
   detection.

5.1.3.  Tunnel Teardown

   Either the SI or SC can teardown the session and tunnel.  This is
   done as specified in [RFC2661].  There is no action specific to
   Softwires in this case.

5.2.  PPP Connection

5.2.1.  MTU

   The MTU of the PPP link SHOULD be the link MTU minus the size of the
   IP, UDP, L2TPv2, and PPP headers together.  On an IPv4 link with an
   MTU equal to 1500 bytes, this would usually mean a PPP MTU of 1460
   bytes.  This may vary according to the size of the L2TP header.  See
   [RFC4623] for a detailed discussion of fragmentation issues.

Internet-Draft    Softwires H & S Framework with L2TPv2    November 2006


5.2.2.  LCP

   Once the L2TPv2 session is established, the SI and SC initiate the
   PPP connection by negotiating LCP as described in [RFC1661].  ACFC
   [RFC1662] SHOULD be rejected.

5.2.3.  Authentication

   After completing LCP negotiation, the SI and SC may optionally
   perform authentication.  If authentication is chosen, CHAP [RFC1994]
   authentication MUST be supported by both the Softwire Initiator and
   Softwire Concentrator.  Other authentication methods such as PAP
   [RFC1994], MS-CHAP [RFC2433], and EAP [RFC3748] MAY be supported.

   A detailed discussion of Softwires security is contained in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-security-requirements]

5.2.4.  IPCP

5.2.4.1.  IPv6CP

   In the IPv6 over IPv4 scenarios (see Section 3.1), after the
   authentication phase, the Softwire Initiator MUST negotiate IPv6CP as
   defined in [RFC2472].  IPv6CP provides a way to negotiate a unique
   64-bit interface identifier to be used for the address
   autoconfiguration at the local end of the link.

5.2.4.2.  IPv4CP

   In the IPv4 over IPv6 scenarios (see Section 3.2), a Softwire
   Initiator MUST negotiate IPCP [RFC1332].  The SI uses IPCP to obtain
   an IPv4 address from the SC.  IPCP may also be used to obtain DNS
   information as described in [RFC1877].

5.3.  Global IPv6 Address Assignement to Endpoints

   In several scenario defined in Section 3, Global IPv6 addresses are
   expected to be allocated to Softwires end points.  Since IPv6CP only
   provide Link-Local addresses (see [RFC2472]), IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   [RFC2462] or DHCPv6 [RFC3315] SHOULD be used to configure these
   addresses.

   The Softwire Initiator of an IPv6 Softwire MUST send a Router
   Solicitation message to the Softwire Concentrator after IPV6CP is
   completed.  The Softwire Concentrator MUST answer with a Router
   Advertisement.  This message MUST contains the global IPv6 prefix of
   the PPP link if Neighbor discovery is used to configure addresses of
   Softwire end points.

   If DHCPv6 is available for address delegation, the M bits of the
   Router Advertisement SHOULD be set.  The Softwire Initiator MUST then
   send a DHCPv6 Request to configure the address of the Softwire
   endpoint.

   Duplicate Address Detection ([I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis]) MUST be
   performed on the Softwire in both cases.

5.4.  DHCP

   The Softwire Initiator MAY use DHCP to get additional information
   such as delegated prefix and DNS servers.  If the SI supports DHCP,
   it SHOULD send a Solicit message to verify if more information is
   available.

   When delegating an IPv4 prefix to the SI, the SC SHOULD inject a
   route for this prefix in the IPv4 routing table in order to forward
   the traffic to the relevant Softwire.

5.4.1.  DHCPv6

   IF a SI establishing an IPv6 Softwire acts as a router (scenarios
   3.1.2 and 3.1.4) it MUST include the IA_PD option [RFC3633] in the
   DHCPv6 Solicit message [RFC3315] in order to request an IPv6 prefix.

   When delegating an IPv6 prefix to the SI, the SC SHOULD inject a
   route for this prefix in the IPv4 routing table in order to forward
   the traffic to the relevant Softwire.

5.4.2.  DHCPv4

   A SI establishing an IPv4 Softwire MAY send a DHCP request containing
   the Subnet Allocation option [I-D.ietf-dhc-subnet-alloc].  This
   practice is not common but may be used to connect IPv4 subnets using
   Softwires, as defined in Section 3.2.2 and Section 3.2.4.

   One Subnet-Request suboption MUST be configured with the 'h' bit set
   to '1', as the SI is expected to perform the DHCP server function.
   The 'i' bit of the Subnet-Request suboption should be set to '0' the
   first time a prefix is requested and to '1' on subsequent requests,
   if a prefix has been allocated.  The Prefix length suboption SHOULD
   be 0 by default.  If the SI is configured to support only specific
   prefix lengths, it should specify the longest (smallest) prefix
   length it supports.

   If the SI was previously assigned a prefix from that same SC, it
   SHOULD include the Subnet Information suboption with the prefix it
   was previously assigned.  The 'c' and 's' bits of the suboption

   SHOULD be set to '0'.


6.  Considerations about the Address Provisioning Model

   This section describes how a Softwire Concentrator may manage
   delegated addresses for Softwire endpoints and for subnets behind the
   Softwire Initiator.  One common practice is to aggregate endpoints
   addresses and delegated prefixes into one prefix routed to the SC.
   The main benefit is to ease the routing scheme by isolating on the SC
   succeeding route injections (when delegating new prefixes for SI).

6.1.  Softwire Endpoints Addresses

6.1.1.  IPv6

   A Softwire Concentrator should provide globally routable addresses to
   Softwire endpoints.  Other types of addresses such as Unique Local
   Addresses [RFC4193] may be used to address Softwire end points in a
   private network with no global connectivity.  A single /64 should be
   assigned to the Softwire to address both Softwire endpoints.

   Global or ULA addresses must be assigned to endpoints when the
   scenario "Host CPE as Softwire Initiator" (described in
   Section 3.1.1) is considered to be deployed.  For other scenarios,
   this may be optional and link local addresses should be used.

6.1.2.  IPv4

   A Softwire Concentrator may provide either globally routable or
   private IPv4 addresses.  When using IPv4 private addresses [RFC1918]
   on the endpoints, it is not not recommended to delegate an IPv4
   private prefix to the SI, as it can lead to a nested-NAT situations.

   The endpoints of the PPP link use host addresses (i.e., /32),
   negotiated using IPCP.

6.2.  Delegated Prefixes

6.2.1.  IPv6 Prefixes

   Delegated IPv6 should be of global scope if assigned IPv6 addresses
   for endpoints are global.  Using ULA addresses is not recommended
   when subnet is connected to the global IPv6 Internet.  When using ULA
   IPv6 address for endpoint, Delegated IPv6 prefix may be either of
   Global or ULA scope.

   Delegated IPv6 prefixes are between /48 and /64 in length.  When a SI

   receives a prefix shorter than 64, it can assign different /64
   prefixes to each of its interfaces.  A SI receiving a single /64 is
   expected to perform bridging if more than one interface are available
   (wired and wireless for example).

6.2.2.  IPv4 Prefixes

   Delegated IPv4 prefixes should be of the same scope than the assigned
   IPv4 addresses and be routable within that address space.  Prefix
   length is between /8 and /30.

6.3.  Possible scenarios

   This section summarizes the differents scenarios for address
   provisioning with the considerations given in the previous sections.

6.3.1.  Scenarios for IPv6

   This table describes the possible combination of IPv6 address scope
   for endpoints and delegated prefixes.

7.  Considerations about Address Stability

   A Softwire can provide stable addresses even if the underlying
   addressing scheme changes, by opposition to automatic tunneling.  A
   Softwire Concentrator should always provide the same address and
   prefix to a reconnecting user.  However, if the goal of the Softwire
   service is to provide a temporary address for a roaming user, it may
   be provisioned to provide only a temporary address.

   The address and prefix are expected to change when reconnecting to a
   different Softwire Concentrator.  However an organization providing a
   Softwire service may provide the same address and prefix across
   different Softwire Concentrators at the cost of a more fragmented
   routing table.  The routing fragmentation issue may be limited if the
   prefixes are aggregated in a location topologically close to the SC.
   This would be the case for example if several SCs are put in parallel
   for load-balancing purpose.


8.  Considerations about RADIUS Integration

   The Softwire Concentrator is expected to act as a client to a AAA
   server, for example a RADIUS server.  During the PPP authentication
   phase, the RADIUS server may return additional informations in the
   form of attributes in the Access Accept message.

   The Softwire Concentrator may include the Tunnel-Type and Tunnel-
   Medium-Type attributes [RFC2868] in the Access Request messages to
   provide a hint of the type of Softwire being configured.

8.1.  Softwires Endpoints







Storer, et al.            Expires May 21, 2007                 [Page 29]

Internet-Draft    Softwires H & S Framework with L2TPv2    November 2006


8.1.1.  IPv6 Softwires

   If the RADIUS server includes a Framed-Interface-Id attribute
   [RFC3162], the Softwire Concentrator must send it to the Softwire
   Initiator in the Interface Identifier field of its IPV6CP
   Configuration Request message.

   If the Framed-IPv6-Prefix attribute is mentioned [RFC3162], that
   prefix MUST be used in the router advertisements sent to the SI.  If
   Framed-IPv6-Prefix is not present but Framed-IPv6-Pool is, the SC
   must choose a prefix with that pool to send RAs.

   If none of the attributes above are included but the AAA server
   returns the Tunnel-Client-Endpoint and Tunnel-Server-Endpoint
   attributes [RFC2868] are present and of the correct address family,
   these must be used in the IPV6CP Interface Identifier and for the
   router advertisements.

8.1.2.  IPv4 Softwires

   If the Framed-IP-Address attribute [RFC2865] is present, the Softwire
   Concentrator must provide that address to the Softwire Initiator
   during IPCP address negotiation.  That is, when the Softwire
   Initiator requests an IP address from the Softwire Concentrator, the
   address provided should be the Framed-IP-Address.

   If the Framed-IP-Address attribute is not present and the Tunnel-
   Client-Endpoint and Tunnel-Server-Endpoint attributes [RFC2868] are
   present and of the correct address family, these should be used in
   the IPCP IP-Address configuration option.

8.2.  Delegated Prefixes

8.2.1.  IPv6 Prefixes

   If the attribute Delegated-IPv6-Prefix
   [I-D.ietf-radext-delegated-prefix] is present in the RADIUS Access
   Accept message, it must be used by the Softwire Concentrator for the
   delegation of the IPv6 prefix.  Since the prefix delegation is
   performed by DHCPv6 and the attribute is linked to a username, the SC
   must associate the DUID of a DHCPv6 request to tunnel it came from
   and its user.

   Interaction between RADIUS, PPP and DHCPv6 server may follow the
   mechanism proposed in [I-D.ietf-dhc-v6-relay-radius].  During the
   Softwire authentication phase, PPP collects the RADIUS attributes for
   the user such as Delegated-IPv6-Prefix.  A specific DHCPv6 relay is
   assigned to the Softwire and fill these attributes in RRAO (Relay

   Agent RADIUS Attribute Option) into succeeding DHCPv6 requests from
   the client before forwarding them to the DHCPv6 server.

8.2.2.  IPv4 Prefixes

   The combination of the Framed-IP-Address and Framed-IP-Netmask
   attributes [RFC2865] may be used by the Softwire Concentrator to
   delegate an IPv4 prefix to the Softwire Initiator.


9.  Considerations for Maintenance and Statistics

9.1.  RADIUS Accounting

   RADIUS Accounting for L2TP and PPP are documented (see Section 4.3).

   When deploying Softwires solutions, operators may experience
   difficulties to differentiate the address family of the traffic
   reported in accounting information from RADIUS.  This problem and
   some potential solutions are described in
   [I-D.stevant-softwire-accounting].

9.2.  MIBs

   MIB support for L2TPv2 and PPP are documented (see Section 4.4).
   Also see [RFC4293]


10.  Security Considerations

   A detailed discussion of Softwires security is contained in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-security-requirements].

   The L2TPv2 Softwires solution provides the following tools for
   security:

   o  IPsec [RFC3193] provides the highest level of security.

   o  PPP CHAP [RFC1994] provides basic user authentication.

   o  L2TP Tunnel Authentication [RFC2661] provides authentication at
      tunnel setup.  It may be used to limit DoS attacks by
      authenticating the tunnel before L2TP session and PPP resources
      are allocated.
