1.  Introduction

   This document describes a lightweight service for checking the
   availability of domain names.  This service is based on the IRIS
   framework and uses the data model defined by DREG.  By doing this,
   the domain availability service has the advantages provided by IRIS
   and DREG, such as well-known methods for server navigation,
   structured queries and results, and layered extensibility.

   The use of IRIS for this service also allows seemless integration
   between the domain availability service and the service provided by
   DREG.  This allows a user to find the availability status of domain
   and reference the full registration information in DREG.

   The data model in this service (called a registry schema in IRIS
   terms) is a strict subset of the DREG data model.  This enables
   implementors to directly reuse DREG code paths and allows operators
   to deploy the service in either the same server processes as a DREG
   service (same host and port) or in a different server process
   (different port) or machine (different host).

   As an example, an operator may wish to deploy both types of service
   on the same set of machines.  As time goes on, the operator may then
   decide to segregate the services, placing the domain availability
   service on one set of machines and the DREG service on a separate set
   of machines with a stricter set of controls.  Either deployment
   scenario is transparent to the end user and always appear to be
   seemlessly complementary.

   When coupled with [20], this domain availability service is
   lightweight and extremely effecient for high-volume, public-facing
   service.

3.  DCHK Registry

   The data model used for the domain availability check (DCHK) service
   is a strict subset of the DREG data model.  This section describes
   the DCHK registry type.  See [5].

3.1  Schema Description

   References to XML elements with no namespace qualifier are from the
   schema defined in Section 3.2.  References to elements and attributes
   with the "iris" XML namespace qualifier are from the schema defined
   in IRIS [5].

   The descriptions contained within this section refer to XML elements
   and attributes and their relation to the exchange of data within the
   protocol.  These descriptions also contain specifications outside the
   scope of the formal XML syntax.  Therefore, this section will use
   terms defined by RFC 2119 [12] to describe the specification outside
   the scope of the formal XML syntax.  While reading this section,
   please reference Section 3.2 for needed details on the formal XML
   syntax.

3.1.1  The <domain> Result

   An example of a <domain> result:

   <domain
     authority="iana.org" registryType="dchk1"
     entityClass="domain-name" entityName="example.com">
     <domainName>example.com</domainName>
     <status><activeAndAssigned/></status>
   </domain>

   The <domain> result represents an instance of a domain assignment.
   The children of the <domain> element are as follows:
   o  <domainName> - the full name of the domain as it is in DNS.  The
      contents of this element MUST be a domain name as specified by RFC
      1035 [11].
   o  <idn> - the name of the domain in nameprep form if applicable.
      See RFC  3491 [17].
   o  <status> - may contain at least one of the following elements of
      type 'domainStatusType' (see Section 3.1.1.1), but none of these
      elements may appear more than once.
      *  <reservedDelegation> - permanently inactive
      *  <assignedAndActive> - normal state
      *  <assignedAndInactive> - registration assigned but delegation
         inactive

Internet-Draft                 iris-dchk                    October 2004


      *  <assignedAndOnHold> - dispute
      *  <revoked> - database purge pending
      *  <transferPending> - change of authority pending
      *  <registryLock> - on hold by registry
      *  <registrarLock> - on hold by registrar
   o  <domainVariant> - contains an entity reference, the referent of
      which MUST be a <domain> (Section 3.1.1).
   o  <registrationReference> - an element containing an entity
      reference, the referent of which MUST be a <domain> (Section
      3.1.1).  The intention of this element is to point to the
      downstream registration reference.  Therefore, if this is a result
      given back by a domain registry, it should point to the domain in
      the domain registrar or registrant service.
   o  <iris:seeAlso> - an element containing an entity reference
      specifying a referent that is indirectly associated with this
      domain.

3.1.1.1  Domain Status Type

   Each element that is of the 'domainStatusType' may have an optional
   <appliedDate> element and one or more <description> elements, the
   text contents of which may be used to describe the status in natural
   language.  Each <description> element must have a 'language'
   attribute describing the language of the description element.

3.1.2  Support for <iris:lookupEntity>

   The following types of entity classes are recognized by the
   <lookupEntity> query of IRIS for this registry:
   o  domain-name - the fully qualified name of a domain.  This a domain
      name as specified by RFC 1035 [11].  Yields a <domain> (Section
      3.1.1) in the response.
   o  idn - the fully qualified name of a domain in nameprep form (see
      RFC 3491 [17]).  Yields a <domain> (Section 3.1.1) in the
      response.

3.2  DCHK Formal XML Syntax

   This registry schema is specified in the XML Schema notation.  The
   formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation
   suitable for automated validation of an XML instance when combined
   with the formal schema syntax of IRIS.


   <?xml version="1.0"?>

3.3  BEEP Transport Compliance

   Though it is envisioned that a DCHK service will be deployed with a
   lightweight transport such as [20], it is still possible to use DCHK
   with the [8] transport.  The use of this transport is completely at
   the descretion of the server operator.

   IRIS allows several extensions of the core capabilities.  This
   section outlines those extensions allowable by IRIS-BEEP [8].

3.3.1  Message Pattern

   This registry type uses the default message pattern as described in
   IRIS-BEEP [8].

3.3.2  Server Authentication

   This registry type uses the default server authentication method as
   described in IRIS-BEEP [8].

3.4  URI Resolution

3.4.1  Application Service Label

   The application service label associated with this registry type MUST
   be "DCHK1".  This is the abbreviated form of the URN for this
   registry type, urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dchk1.

3.4.2  Bottom-Up Resolution

   The bottom-up alternative resolution method MUST be identified as
   'bottom' in IRIS URI's.

   The process for this resolution method differs from the
   direct-resolution method if the authority is only a domain name (i.e.
   without the port number).  The process for this condition is as
   follows:
   1.  The IRIS [5] direct resolution process is tried on the domain
       name (e.g.  "example.com" ).
   2.  If the direct resolution process yields no server for which a
       connection can be made, then the leftmost label of the domain
       name is removed, and the first step is repeated again (e.g.
       "com" ).

Internet-Draft                 iris-dchk                    October 2004


   3.  If all the labels of the domain name are removed and no server
       connections have been made, then the DNS is queried for the
       address records corresponding to the original domain name and the
       port used is the well-known port for the default protocol of
       IRIS.

3.4.3  Top-Down Resolution

   The top-down alternative resolution method MUST be identified as
   'top' in IRIS URI's.

   The process for this resolution method differs from the
   direct-resolution method if the authority is only a domain name (i.e.
   without the port number).  The process for this condition is as
   follows:
   1.  The domain name is reduced to its rightmost label.  This is
       always '.'.
   2.  The IRIS [5] direct resolution process is tried on the domain
       name.
   3.  If the direct resolution process yields no server for which a
       connection can be made, then the original label to the left of
       the rightmost label of the domain name is prepended, and the
       second step is repeated again (e.g.  if "." then "com", if "com"
       then "example.com").
   4.  If all the labels of the original domain are present and no
       server connections have been made, then the DNS is queried for
       the address records corresponding to the original domain name and
       the port used is the well-known port for the default protocol of
       IRIS.

4.  Internationalization Considerations

   Implementers should be aware of considerations for
   internationalization in IRIS [5].

   This document specifies the lookup of domain names, both the
   traditional ASCII form and the IDN form.  In addition, the social
   data associated with contacts may also be non-ASCII, and could
   contain virtually any Unicode character.  The <language> element is
   provided in queries that have potential to traverse such data.
   Clients should use these elements to indicate to the server of the
   target languages desired, and servers should use these elements to
   better enable normalization and search processes (see [21]).

   Clients needing to localize the data tags in this protocol should
   take note that localization is only needed on the names of XML
   elements and attributes with the exception of elements containing
   date and time information.  The schema for this registry has been
   designed so that clients need not interpret the content of elements
   or attributes for localization, other than those elements containing
   date and time information.

   Clients should also make use of the <language> elements provided in
   many of the results.  Results containing data that may be in Unicode
   are accompanied by these elements in order to aid better presentation
   of the data to the user.

   The "dateTimePrivacyType" element type contains the XML Schema [3]
   data type "dateTime".  The contents of this element MUST be specified
   using the 'Z' indicator for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1  XML Namespace URN Registration

   This document makes use of a proposed XML namespace and schema
   registry specified in XML_URN [18].  Accordingly, the following
   registration information is provided for the IANA:
   o  URN/URI:
      *  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dchk1
   o  Contact:
      *  Andrew  Newton <andy@hxr.us>
   o  XML:
      *  The XML Schema specified in Section 3.2

5.2  S-NAPTR Registration

   The following S-NAPTR application service label will need to be
   registered with IANA according to the IANA considerations defined in
   IRIS [5]:
      DCHK1

5.3  BEEP Registration

   The following BEEP Profile URI is to be registeried with IANA, in
   addition to the registration provided in IRIS-BEEP [8].

6.  Security Considerations

   IRIS-LWZ is intended for serving public data; it provides no in-band
   mechanisms for authentication or encryption.  Any application that
   needs that must provide out of band mechanisms to provide it (e.g.,
   IPSec), or use the IRIS protocol with an application transport that
   provides such capabilities (e.g.  BEEP [7].
