1.  Introduction

   [RFC7117] and [RFC6513] specify procedures for supporting multicast
   in Border Gateway Protocol/MultiProtocol Label Switching (BGP/MPLS)
   Layer 2 (L2) and Layer 3 (L3) VPN (Virtual Private Network),
   respectively.

   Multicast service in BGP/MPLS L2 and L3 VPN can be achieved by using
   various kinds of transport mechanism for forwarding a packet to all
   or a subset of Provider Edge routers (PEs) across service provider
   networks.  Such transport mechanisms are referred to as provider
   tunnels (P-tunnels).

   The signaling of P-tunnel choice is very similar for multicast in
   both L2 and L3 VPNs.  [RFC7117] and [RFC6513] describe BGP-based
   mechanisms for Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and Multicast VPN
   (MVPN), respectively.  [RFC6514] defines the Provider Multicast
   Service Interface (PMSI) tunnel attribute, a BGP attribute that
   specifies information of a P-tunnel.  The PMSI tunnel attribute is
   advertised/received by PEs in BPG auto-discovery (A-D) routes.
   [RFC6513] also proposes a UDP-based signaling mechanism.

   This document defines a textual conventions (TC) that can be used to
   represent types of P-tunnels used for multicast in BGP/MPLS L2 or L3
   VPN within MIB module specifications.

   This document also describes common managed objects used by other MIB
   modules which are designed for monitoring and/or configuring both L2
   and L3 VPN that support multicast.

Internet-Draft             L2L3-VPN-MCAST MIB              February 2017


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.1.  Terminology

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [RFC6513] [RFC6514] [RFC7117] and other documents that
   they refer to.  Familiarity with Multicast, MPLS, L3 VPN, MVPN
   (Multicast VPN) concepts and/or mechanisms is assumed.  Some terms
   specifically related to this document are explained below.

   The term "Multicast VPN (MVPN)" [RFC6513] refers to a BGP/MPLS L3
   (IP) VPN service that supports multicast.

   "Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI)" [RFC6513] is a
   conceptual interface instantiated by a P-tunnel, a transport
   mechanism used to deliver multicast traffic.  A PE uses to send
   customer multicast traffic to all or some PEs in the same VPN.

   There are two kinds of PMSI: "Inclusive PMSI (I-PMSI)" and "Selective
   PMSI (S-PMSI)" [RFC6513].  An I-PMSI is a PMSI that enables a PE
   attached to a particular MVPN to transmit a message to all PEs in the
   same VPN.  An S-PMSI is a PMSI that enables a PE attached to a
   particular MVPN to transmit a message to some of the PEs in the same
   VPN.

   Throughout this document, we will use the term "I/S-PMSI" to refer
   both "I-PMSI" and "S-PMSI".

   [RFC6513] describes following tunnel setup techniques that can be
   used to create the P-tunnels that instantiate the PMSIs.

   o  Protocol Independent Multicast tree

      *  Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) tree [RFC4601]

      *  Source Specific Multicast (PIM-SSM) tree [RFC4601]

      *  Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicast (BIDIR-PIM) tree
         [RFC5015]

   o  Label Distribution Protocol Extension for Multipoint Label
      Switched Paths (mLDP) [RFC6388]

      *  Point-to-MultiPoint (mLDP P2MP)

      *  Point-to-MultiPoint (mLDP MP2MP)

Internet-Draft             L2L3-VPN-MCAST MIB              February 2017


   o  Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering Point-to-
      Multipoint (RSVP-TE P2MP) Label Switched Path [RFC4875]

   o  Ingress Replication through Unicast Tunnels [RFC6513]

   A created tunnel will be identified by Tunnel Identifier.  The length
   of the identifier differs depending on the setup technique that is
   used to create the tunnel.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Summary of MIB Module

   This document defines two MIB modules: L2L3-VPN-MCAST-TC-MIB and
   L2L3-VPN-MCAST-MIB.

   o  L2L3-VPN-MCAST-TC-MIB contains a Textual Convention
      L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelType that provides an enumeration of the
      provider tunnel types.

   o  L2L3-VPN-MCAST-MIB defines a table
      l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable.  An entry of this table
      corresponds with a PMSI Tunnel Attribute (PTA) advertised/received
      by PE routers.  The entry of the table will be used by other MIB
      modules which are designed for monitoring and/or configuring both
      L2 and L3 VPN that support multicast.
      The table index is composed of multiple attributes that depend on
      the tunnel type and uniquely identify a tunnel.
      The table may also be used in conjunction with other MIBs, such as
      MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB (MPLS-TE-STD-MIB) [RFC3812], to
      obtain the other details of a tunnel by following the row pointer
      of the corresponding tunnel's row in this table.  It may also be
      used in conjunction with Interfaces Group MIB (IF-MIB) [RFC2863]
      to obtain the other details of a corresponding interface that

          When l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeType is set to
          noTunnelId, the PMSI Tunnel attribute does not have
          tunnel information. Thus, the size of this object is zero.

          When l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeType is set to
          rsvpP2mp, the Tunnel Identifier is composed of
          Extended Tunnel ID (4 octets in IPv4, 16 octets in IPv6),
          Reserved (2 octets), Tunnel ID (2 octets), and
          P2MP ID (4 octets). Thus, the size of this object is
          12 octets in IPv4 and 24 octets in IPv6.

          When l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeType is set to
          ldpP2mp, the Tunnel Identifier is a 17 octets
          (in IPv4) or 29 octets (in IPv6) P2MP Forwarding
          Equivalence Class (FEC) Element.

          When l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeType is set to
          pimSsm, PimAsm, or PimBidir, the Tunnel Identifier is
          a pair of source and group IP addresses.
          Thus, the size of this object is 16 octets in IPv4
          and 32 octets in IPv6.

          When l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeType is set to
          ingressReplication, the Tunnel Identifier is
          the unicast tunnel endpoint IP address of the local
          PE. Thus, the size of this object is 4 octets in IPv4
          and 16 octets in IPv6.

          When l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeType is set to
          ldpMp2mp, the Tunnel Identifier is a 17 octets
          (in IPv4) or 29 octets (in IPv6) MP2MP FEC Element.

          When BGP-based I/S-PMSI signaling is used, the value of
          this object corresponds with the the Tunnel
          Identifier field in an advertised/received I/S-PMSI
          A-D route. Thus, the size of this object is determined

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelPointer and l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelIf in
      l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable will point the corresponding
      entry of in other table containing configuration and/or
      performance information of a tunnel and an interface.  If an
      Administrator does not want to reveal this information, then these
      objects should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to




Zhang & Tsunoda          Expires August 25, 2017               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             L2L3-VPN-MCAST MIB              February 2017


   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to root MIB objects in the MIB module contained in
   this document under the mib-2 subtree.
