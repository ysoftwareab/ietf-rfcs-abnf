1.  Introduction

   In cloud datacenter deployment,virtualized infrastructure of virtual
   machines and physcial infrastructure of bare-metal servers are both
   deployed in the network.  Openstack K version, SDN controller, open
   virtual switch, SDN ToR (top of rack) switches and SDN gateways are
   used.In this cloud-based deployment, Openstack manages computing,
   storage and network of the entire network system by its modules
   including neutron, nova, ironic, swift and so on.SDN controller is
   responsible for the network provision and management.  It receives
   messages of network operations from applications or Openstack neutron
   and translates them into commands/operations for forwarding
   devices.Open virtual switch, SDN ToR switch and SDN gateway are
   forwarding devices in this senario.

   With this deployment, we now face some problems in managing such SDN
   network with all these added heterogeneous devices.The management can
   be devided into several parts: network monitoring, network detection,
   and alarm and log for devices, services and tenants.

   Difficulties lie in that:

   (1) Two network layers including overlay and underlay increases the
   difficulty in troubleshooting.

   (2) Software-based devices such as open virtual swith, openstack and
   others face the problem of high availability as well as the link
   availability.

   (3) Logical network can be operated by tenants.  Thus there are
   overlaps between the management of tenants and network administrator

   (4) Openstack server, controller, open virtual switch and SDN tor are
   new devices which should be covered by network manager system as well
   as large numbers of virtual machines.

   (5) Operations can be at anytime and anywhere with the requirement of
   real-time requirement.

   This draft presents several use cases in management of SDN
   datacenters.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Definition of terms

   EP: end point

   NFV: network function virtualization

   SDN: software defined network

   SFC: service function chaining

   ToR: top of rack

   VM: virtual machine

   VPC: virtual private cloud

   ovs: open virtual switch

4.  SDN management usecases

4.1.  Network monitoring

   Network monitoring includes monitoring configurations of network
   devices, physical topology and logical topology.Network monitoring
   should be based on underlay and overlay network.Virtualized network
   elements correspond to physical network devices.Virtual networks of
   VMs correspond to vsw with its interface as well as the ToR.Real-time
   monitoring is required.Status of devices and topologies should be
   updated automately.Performance of devices are also monitored.

   Tenants can get the information of their own logical network
   including configuration, topology, and performance in order to own
   network self-management.

   Network administrator can get the information of network resources
   and system resources.The network resources includes virtual network
   resources such as subnet and traffic path and physical network
   resources such as vxlan gateway, ovs, ToR and so on.  System resource
   includes controller, IT resources, devices of firewall and load
   balancer.

4.2.  Network detection

   Network detection aims at trouble-shooting automatically and fault
   prediction.In underlay network, traditional detection technologies
   can be used as usual.In SDN network, detection should also be
   provided in the overlay network.With the collected information of

   packet-loss and time delay as well as the logical and physical
   topology,we can undergo the trouble-shooting and prediction.

   For example, the vtep detection can detect the time delay and packet-
   loss between each two vteps in a SDN network.  The point where packet
   lost should be detected again with two vteps.Thus the fault point can
   be found.

                         Figure 2: vtep detection

   The service detection verifies the service availability such as VPC
   or service function chain.  Controller simulates the traffic of the
   virtual private cloud of one tenant with virtual routers and virtual
   bridges.  With the collected information of traffic, the availability
   of tenants' service are detected.

4.3.  Overlaps of management between tenants and network administrator

   Tenants can manage their own network by network configuration in VPC.
   Performance of tenants' VPC can be observed by tenants themself.
   Network administrator can not only get the information of each
   tenant, but also has the overall view.  As a result, there are
   overlaps between tenants and network administrator.

   The contents of difference and relationship between tenants
   management and network administrator management are TBD.

4.4.  Alarm and log of new SDN devices and network

   It's easy of design alarm and log in devices monitoring.  While in
   overlay networks related with tenants, alarm and log needs to be
   taken overall consideration.

   The contents of alarm and log are TBD.

4.5.  High availability of software-based devices and networks

   As openstack server, ovs and VMs are brought in,availability should
   be considered.  Besides, availability of virtual and physical link
   should be covered.

   The contents of availability of devices and networks are TBD.

5.  Conclusion

   In SDN network deployment,new challenages are brought in such as two
   layers of networks, SDN devices, large scales of virtual machines,
   real-time management requirements,and so on.Under these challenages,
   SDN network management should be considered throughly..
