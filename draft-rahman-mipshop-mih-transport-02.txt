   Abstract  
        
   This document describes a mechanism for using UDP/IP for the 
   transport of Media Independent Handover (MIH) messages between 
   network nodes. MIH messages carry technology specific link layer 
   information and commands that can be used to optimize handover 
   procedures across different access technologies such as cellular and 
   WLAN. MIH will complement Layer 3 mobility protocols such as Mobile 
   IP.

   1.  Introduction  
        
   IEEE 802.21 working group is developing lower layer (i.e. below IP) 
   services to enable seamless handover across different access 
   technologies. Services are termed Information Services (IS), Event 
   Services(ES), and Command Services (CS) [1]. These services are used 
   by an MIH Application that can be located either in a Mobile Node 
   (MN) or a Mobility Manager (MM) node.   
          
   An important concept in [1] is that MIH Service messages can be 
   exchanged between network nodes that may not be in the same sub-
   network.  This is referred to as remote MIH message exchange. This 
   places requirements for new functionality to be defined in IP level 
   protocols which are described in [2].  
        
   An example of remote message exchange is when an MN on a given 
   wireless technology, say WLAN, may require to handover to another 
   technology because the WLAN coverage is degrading. MIH remote message 
   exchange functionality allows the MN to query an MM for a list of 
   alternative access technologies to handover to in the area where the 
   WLAN coverage is degrading.  The MM would then use IS messages to 
   reply back with, for example, a list of cellular and WMAN candidates 
   that the MN could handover to. This document describes a mechanism 
   for transport of remote MIH messages using UDP/IP.

   3.  Background on MIH Messages  
        
   It is important to understand what fields the MIH message frames 
   provide (as specified in IEEE 802.21) so as to re-use as much 
   functionality as possible and focus mainly on solving transport 
   related problems.  
    
      MIH message frames use a common header for all types of services 
      i.e. Information, Command, and Event. However, by setting some 
      fields in this header to specific values, an MIH message can be 
      identified as  carrying a payload related to a specific service. 
      Thus, there is no need to re-define specific headers for specific 
      service type, and this existing common MIH header should be re-
      used at the MIH “layer” and is hence out of the transport solution 
      scope. 
    
      There are three relevant MIH protocol identifiers that are present 
      in MIH message frames:  
    
         1. MIHF ID - uniquely defines MIHF endpoints and its use     
            enables the MIH protocol to be transport agnostic.    
         2. Session ID - a 32-bit unique random number within a pair of  
            MIHFs of a source and destination of a session request.

Internet Draft        Transport of MIH Messages        February 28, 2007 
    
     
         3. Transaction ID - an identifier that is used with every MIH  
            initiator and its response message. It is required to match  
            each request, response or indication message and its  
            acknowledgment.  
    
      No new headers at the transport layer should be defined to 
      accomplish the same goals that these identifiers already serve to 
      meet. Instead, they should be re-used thereby eliminating such 
      requirements from the transport  layer. 
       
      Other important fields that are present in the MIH frames are ACK 
      Request and ACK Response that are used to optionally request for 
      acknowledgements, and to acknowledge the receipt of messages 
      respectively. Thus, a connectionless-oriented transport can be 
      complemented with reliability by the re-use of these existing 
      acknowledgement fields in MIH message frames. 
    
      Another important requirement to consider is multiplexing – MIH 
      multiplexing and transport multiplexing - as shown in Figure 1.

           Figure 1: MIH Multiplexing and Transport Mulitplexing 
       
      MIH multiplexing is a requirement on the MIH layer, specifically 
      between the MIH Function and an MIH User (as shown in Figure 1) 
      and is therefore not a responsibility of the transport layer. In 
      other words, it is the MIH Function that is locally responsible 
      for relaying MIH messages to the appropriate user. 
       
      Transport multiplexing involves sending a specific MIH message to 
      the right MIH peer amongst several communicating peers. In IEEE 
      802.21, every MIH capable  node is  uniquely identified by its  
      MIHF  Identifier hence making the MIH protocol transport agnostic.

      Sending an MIH message (over IP) to a peer involves discovering 
      the MIHF Identifier of  the peer and its associated IP address; 
      and then sending the message (in an IP packet) to the associated 
      address. The traveling of this IP packet to the destination is 
      nothing but regular IP routing. Thus, MIH transport multiplexing 
      is taken care of at the IP layer and there is no need to further 
      implement any functionality at the MIH transport layer. 
    
        
   4. UDP as Transport Mechanism  
        
   UDP is widely used by many control protocols because it provides a 
   very simple and fast transport mechanism. Since UDP does not provide 
   for reliability, retransmission algorithms can be defined at the 
   application layer to complement UDP if required. One example of UDP 
   transport for a control protocol is the widely used Session 
   Initiation Protocol (SIP), which commonly makes use of UDP as a 
   transport mechanism. SIP implements reliability by making use of 
   retransmissions and acknowledgement messages. The Simple Network  
   Management Protocol (SNMP) is another control protocol that relies on 
   UDP as a transport mechanism. UDP has also been proposed as the 
   transport mechanism in the Network-based Localized Mobility 
   Management (NETLMM) Working Group in IETF.    
   Because of the proven advantages stated before and its wide adoption 
   as transport for control protocols, this document proposes the use of 
   UDP as transport for MIH messages. Moreover, the MIH protocol already 
   provides several options that can be re-used with UDP to implement a 
   simple, fast, and reliable (optional) transport mechanism for MIH 
   messages. 
        
        
   5.  Network Model  
        
   With the rapid emergence of wireless technologies it is often the 
   case that there are several access technologies in a given 
   geographical area. This mix of technologies makes seamless mobility 
   more challenging, as it requires the mobility protocols to account 
   for the different access link layers. Figure 2 shows a representative 
   network with cellular, WLAN and WMAN access technologies which are 
   all connected to the Internet. Also shown is an MN which may move 
   between the different access technologies based on coverage, QoS or  
   other requirements. Finally, there is also an MM connected to the 
   network which will aid the MN in its mobility decisions.  Both the MM 
   and MN contain an MIH Application and will be able to communicate MIH 
   remote messages via UDP/IP.

   6.  Discovery  
     
   Prior to the exchange of MIH remote messages between peers, the 
   discovery of a peer MIH node in the network must be done. Depending 
   on the network architecture different discovery mechanisms may be 
   possible. For example, if a network operator has an integrated 
   network made up of cellular and WMAN technologies, there might not be 
   a need for many MM nodes, thus only one such node can be deployed and 
   an MIH peer can interact with the MM node via IP regardless if the 
   underlying connection is cellular or WMAN. If this is the case, 
   the address of an MM may be hard coded in an MIH enabled device. If 
   there is a need for multiple MM nodes (e.g. there is one MM per 
   access technology type), the discovery of MM nodes may be done using 
   DHCP as proposed in [4].  
        
    
   7.  Encapsulation Model  
        
   Figure 3 illustrates the encapsulation principle for MIH messages.  
   Essentially, the MIH message shall be inserted inside a UDP datagram 
   which can fit in either an IPv4 or IPv6 packet.

                         Figure 4: An MIH Application Enabled MN  
            
    
   The following steps are involved in processing an MIH message that is 
   transmitted from an MN:  
        
      1. The MIH Application shall generate an MIH message (as specified  
      in IEEE 802.21) and pass it to the Transport Layer (UDP) through  
      the newly defined port.  
          
      2. The UDP shall encapsulate the data in a UDP datagram and shall       
      set the header fields accordingly.    
        
      3. The datagram shall be then sent to the Network Layer (IP) where  
      it shall in turn be encapsulated in an IP packet and all the  
      header fields of  the packet shall be set accordingly. This packet  
      shall then be sent to the  appropriate lower layer for  
      transmission through the network.        
    
   The steps taken by the MN to receive an MIH message are symmetric to 
   the steps explained above and the flow shall be in the reverse path 
   as follows:   
           
      1. Upon reception of a packet, the Network layer (IP) shall strip

      off the IP header, process it and forward it to the transport  
      protocol (UDP).    
        
      2. Upon reception of the UDP datagram, the transport layer (UDP)  
      shall process the packet and shall forward the contents of its  
      data field it to the MIH Application. Since the MIH Application  
      shall have a newly   defined port number, the MIH message would be  
      forwarded   to the MIH Application through that port.   
               
      3. The MIH Application shall then decode the MIH message according  
      to the IEEE 802.21 specification [1] and shall then react as  
      required.    
        
   A network node such as an MM shall follow a similar process.  
        
    
   9.  MIH Proxy Entity   
     
   If an access network (e.g. WLAN) implements an MIH Application, it 
   may inter-work (Proxy) L2 messages that it receives from the MN. 
   Similarly, it can also inter-work UDP/IP messages that it receives 
   from the MM. Thus, when the Proxy Function in the access network 
   receives L2 frames or UDP/IP packets, it shall verify if the 
   underlying message is an MIH message or not. If the L2 frame or 
   UDP/IP packet contains an MIH message, the MIH Application in the 
   access network shall then be triggered to process the message. If the 
   underlying message is not an MIH message, it shall be routed to its 
   destination and the MIH Application shall not be triggered.  
        
   The following steps are involved in inter-working L2 messages to  
   UDP/IP messages in a WLAN network:  
        
      1. A WLAN frame containing the MIH message is received via the  
      WLAN interface (L2 signaling) in the WLAN network.  
        
      2. The L1/L2 processing removes the WLAN frame header.  
        
      3. The encapsulated data is passed to the Proxy Function which 
      recognizes it as an MIH message. The Proxy Function then triggers  
      the MIH Application to which it then passes the message.  
           
      4. The MIH Application decodes the message and decides about the  
      next actions to be executed. The MIH message is then passed back 
      to the Proxy Function.  
        
      5. The Proxy Function recognizes that the message is to be

      redirected to the MM. It then passes the message to the UDP/IP  
      layer for encapsulation.  
        
      6. The MIH message is encapsulated in a UDP Datagram, which in  
      turn is inserted into an IP packet. The IP packet is then sent to  
      the lower layers for transmission into the network. 
    
      7. The lower layers perform the necessary frame encapsulation of  
      the IP packet and transmit the final data into the network.  
           
    
   The above steps are represented by the “Inter-work L2 message to  
   UDP/IP message” rectangles in Figure 7. When the WLAN receives an MIH 
   message in an IP packet from the MM (that is to be directed to the 
   MN), the reverse steps take place. This is represented by the “Inter-
   work UDP/IP message to L2 message” rectangles in Figure 7.  
        
    
   10.  Transport Mechanism Details  
        
   This section provides the details of MIH encapsulation in a UDP/IP 
   packet, the transport mechanism used to quickly and reliably deliver  
   MIH messages, examples and signaling scenarios between an MN and an 
   MM.  
        
        
   10.1.  MIH Message Encapsulation   
        
   Figure 5 gives the details of an IPv6 packet that encapsulates the 
   UDP datagram. However, an IPv4 packet can also be used since the 
   encapsulation of a UDP datagram is the same in both cases. The UDP 
   datagram (with an MIH message in it) resides in the IPv6 Data field.   
   No changes are necessary to the IPv6 (or IPv4) packet headers for 
   support of MIH message transport.

   10.2.  MIH Message Delivery   
        
   Even though UDP does not provide reliable transport, this section 
   shows how reliability can be implemented at the application layer (in 
   this case the MIH Application) by using application retransmission 
   timers. The mechanism involves an interaction between the sender and 
   the receiver of an MIH message and is as follows:  
    
      1. The sender of a message may indicate that an ACK message should    
      be returned by the receiver. This is done by setting ACK Request  
      bit internally in the MIH message frame.  The details of this      
      field and other fields of the MIH message frame are specified in              
      IEEE 802.21 [1]. An application retransmission timer is then set 
  
 
Rahman, et al.        Expires – August 28, 2007                [Page 13] 
 
Internet Draft        Transport of MIH Messages        February 28, 2007 
    
     
      just after the transmission. If an ACK message arrives to the  
      sender before the timer expires, then the message is assumed to  
      have been delivered correctly to the receiver. If an ACK does not  
      arrive within the timeout period then the sender will retransmit  
      the message (a few times as described in Section 9.3) until an ACK  
      arrives.   
           
      2. The receiver (i.e. the MIH Application in the receiving node),     
      upon receipt of a message (whose ACK Request bit field is set to  
      1), will send an ACK message to acknowledge the receipt of an MIH  
      message. This is done by setting the ACK Respond bit of the MIH  
      message frame as specified in IEEE 802.21 [1] and inserting it  
      into a UDP datagram.  
        
      3. The optional UDP Checksum field can also be used to check for  
      errors in messages. If used and a message is found to be in error,  
      the UDP will not forward the data to the application layer. This  
      means that the receiving application will never receive the  
      encapsulated MIH message and cannot send an ACK message. Thus the  
      sender of the message would eventually retransmit after its       
      retransmission timer expires.  
        
      The next section discusses the values of the retransmission timers  
      based on the type of MIH message that is sent.  
        
        
   10.3.  MIH Application Retransmission Timers  
        
   Because the contents of certain MIH messages are more sensitive to 
   delay than others, the values of the retransmission timers should be 
   different for the three MIH message types. For example, messages that   
   contain information (such as a list of neighboring network operators)    
   can be sent periodically to update the mobile nodes and can have the 
   longest retransmission timer. On the other hand, in a network    
   controlled handover scenario for example, the MM may issue a command 
   to a mobile node to handover to a target access technology. Since 
   this node manages the available network resources, such a message 
   would be required to arrive as fast as possible. Thus, the 
   retransmission timer associated with command messages should be 
   shorter than those of messages with information. Thus, three 
   retransmission timers should be used depending on the type of MIH 
   message that is sent:  
        
      1. Information Timer that is set after the transmission of a

      3. Command Timer that is set after the transmission of a message  
      that is related to Commands.  
        
   Shown below are example retransmission timer values associated with 
   the various types of messages. They represent the round-trip time 
   i.e. the time in which a message is sent and its corresponding ACK is 
   received.

      Service (ES)        Timer (T2)                
                              
      Command             Command          100 ms        T3 < T2 (Most     
      Service (CS)        Timer (T3)                     time sensitive)  
        
        
   In order to prevent congestion, a sending node should attempt only a 
   certain number of retransmissions. For example, if a sender does not 
   receive an ACK for a previously sent message, it may retransmit the 
   same message a few times. In the case the sender does not receive an 
   ACK after the last retransmission, it could perform a back off 
   process before starting another retry session.  
    
    
   10.4.  Signaling Scenario Example 1: Direct MIH Signaling over UDP/IP  
        
   Figure 6 shows a signaling scenario, between an MN and an MM, 
   illustrating the concepts developed earlier in this document. Note 
   that UDP is assumed to be used as the transport protocol for all IP 
   based messages shown in the figure.

        Figure 6: Direct Signaling Between an MN and an MM over UDP/IP  
     
       
   The signaling steps are explained below:  
        
      1. The MN powers up and connects to WLAN.  
        
      2. The MIH Application sends a message containing a request for 
      IS - the list of neighboring operators for the cellular link. It 
      sets its Information Timer as soon as it sends the message.   
        
      3. Since the message contained a request for IS, the 
      retransmission timer is set to T1 seconds. In this example the MN 
      does not receive an ACK during this time and therefore    
      retransmits the request and resets its Information Timer.  
        
      4. The MM transmits an ACK message to the MN which arrives      
      before the Information Timer at the MN expires.  
        
      5. The MM sends a response message to the MN containing the     
      list of neighboring cellular operators and sets its Information 
      Timer.  
        
      6. The MN sends an ACK to the MM and it arrives before the  
      Information Timer at the MM expires.  
        
   After Step 6, there can be different actions that can be taken 
   depending if a handover is network controlled or mobile controlled. 
   Both cases are considered below:  
        
      Case I - Network Controlled Handover  
        
      7. The MN informs the MM that its WLAN link is degrading and  
      that it has detected a cellular link, by sending an MIH "Link   
      Going Down" ES and "New Link Detected" ES. It then sets its Event  
      Timer.  
        
      8. The MN’s timer expires after T2 seconds during which it does    
      not receive an ACK from the MM. It then retransmits the ES and  
      resets its Event Timer.  
       
      9. The MM sends an ACK message to the MN which receives it before 
      the MN’s Event Timer expires.

Internet Draft        Transport of MIH Messages        February 28, 2007 
    
    
      10. The MM sends an MIH "Handover Command" to the MN indicating  
      that the MN should handover to the detected cellular link. It sets  
      its Command Timer.  
    
      11. The MM’s Command Timer expires after T3 since it did not 
      receive an ACK. It therefore retransmits the MIH Command and 
      resets its Command Timer.  
        
      12. The MN then sends an ACK which arrives before the MM’s  
      Command Timer expires.  
        
      13. The MN, after performing the necessary actions that completed  
      the handover to the cellular link, sends an MIH "Link UP" ES to 
      inform the MM about its completion of the handover process. It  
      sets its Event Timer and waits for an ACK message.  
       
      14. The MM sends an ACK message to the MN and it arrives before  
      the MN’s Event Timer expires.  
        
      15. The MN continues its IP connection over the cellular link.   
        
      Case II - Mobile Controlled Handover  
        
      7. The MN sends an MIH "Link UP" ES to inform the MM about its  
      completion of the handover process. It sets its Event Timer and  
      waits for an ACK message.  
        
      8. The MM sends an ACK message to the MN and it arrives before the  
      MN’s Event Timer expires.  
        
      9. The MN continues its IP connection over the cellular link.  
    
    
   10.5.  Signaling Scenario 2: MIH Signaling via WLAN MIH Proxy  
      
   Figure 7 shows the sequence of message exchanges between the MN and 
   the MM with the MIH Application enabled WLAN acting as a Proxy. Every 
   time a message is received from either the MM or the MN, the MIH  
   Proxy in the WLAN is triggered and takes the necessary actions. See 
   Section 6.6 for detailed functions of the MIH Proxy in the WLAN. The 
   same reliability mechanism for UDP/IP transport that was previously 
   discussed will be used between the WLAN and the MM.

                session over cellular  
        
          Figure 7: Signaling Between an MN and an MM via a WLAN Proxy  
    
   The signaling steps are explained below for the network controlled 
   handover case:  
        
      1. The MN powers up and connects to WLAN.  
      
      2. The MIH Application sends an L2 message containing a request  
      for IS - the list of neighboring operators for the cellular link.  
      The MN is aware that the WLAN supports MIH functionality through  
      L2 signaling.  
      
      3. The WLAN inter-works the L2 message to UDP/IP message and sends 
      the MIH message to the MM. It then sets its Information Timer.  
     
      4. An ACK does not arrive at the WLAN within T1 seconds. The WLAN  
      thus retransmits the message to the MM and resets its Information  
      Timer.

      5. The MM sends an ACK message to the WLAN which receives it  
      before the Information Timer expires.  
           
      6. The MM sends a response message to the WLAN that is to be  
      delivered to the MN. The MM sets its Information Timer.  
       
      7. The WLAN sends an ACK to acknowledge the receipt of the MIH  
      message. The ACK arrives at the MM before its Information Timer  
      expires. The WLAN performs the necessary steps to inter-work the  
      message to the MN.  
      
      8. The message is inter-worked from the WLAN to the MN and sent  
      via L2 Signaling.  
       
      9. The MN sends an MIH "Link Going Down" ES and "New Link Detected  
      ES to the WLAN via L2 signaling.   
        
      10. The WLAN inter-works the ES to the MM, over UDP/IP, and sets  
      its Event Timer.  
        
      11. An ACK does not arrive at the WLAN within T2 seconds. The WLAN  
      thus retransmits the message to the MM and resets its Event Timer.   
        
      12. The MM sends an ACK to the WLAN to acknowledge receipt of the    
      MIH message. The ACK arrives at the WLAN before the Event Timer  
      expires. 
     
      13. The MM performs some internal actions and decides that the UE  
      should handover to a cellular operator. The MM sends an MIH  
      "Handover to Cellular Command" to WLAN which is to redirect the  
      message to the MN. The MM sets its Command Timer.  
     
      14. An ACK does not arrive at the MM within T3 seconds. The MM  
      thus retransmits the message to the WLAN and resets its Command  
      Timer.  
           
      15. The WLAN sends an ACK to the MM. The ACK arrives before the  
      MM’s Command Timer expires.  
        
      16. The WLAN inter-works the CS to the MN via L2 signaling.  
        
      17. The MN takes the necessary handover actions and completes the  
      handover process to a cellular link. The MN sends an MIH "Link  
      Handover Complete" ES via L2 signaling to the MM via the WLAN  
      Proxy.  
        
      18. The WLAN inter-works the ES from the MN to the MM and sets its  
      Event Timer.

      19. The MM sends an ACK message to the WLAN which receives it  
      before its Event Timer expires.  
       
      20. The MN continues its IP connection over the cellular link.  
        
   The above scenarios show how reliability is implemented using 
   retransmission timers (with different values corresponding to 
   different MIH messages) and ACK messages at the application layer 
   i.e. the MIH Application. Note however that the assumption in the 
   examples was that each time a message is sent, the ACK Request bit in 
   the MIH message frame was set, indicating that the receiver has to 
   acknowledge receipt of the message. Implementers can choose not to 
   set an ACK Request bit for every MIH message that is sent. Instead, 
   an ACK Request bit can only be set as needed, for example, when 
   sending an IS; this bit may not be set. On the other hand, when 
   sending ES and CS, the ACK Request bit might be set because these 
   messages are more sensitive relative to IS messages and thus require 
   acknowledgement of receipt.  
        
    
   11.  Interaction of MIH with Other Protocols  
        
   It is important to note that the MIH does not provide IP Mobility. IP 
   Mobility will be provided by Layer 3 (L3) protocols such as Mobile IP 
   (MIP) or Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). What MIH provides is 
   support of L3 mobility protocols by coordinating the actions of the 
   lower layers in a standardized manner. For example, the MIH 
   Application in an MN can trigger a MIP client to perform network 
   discovery, as soon as possible, after the establishment of a new link 
   layer connection. Also an MIH Application can set up multiple link   
   layers in a coordinated fashion to allow true "make-before-break" 
   handovers.  
     
        
   12.  NAT Traversal  
        
   Nodes in private networks or behind NATs can have problems with peer 
   to peer communication because they do not use globally routable IP 
   addresses.  
    
   The most common NAT problem is that a NAT only allows packets 
   associated with outbound sessions to traverse the NAT. Incoming 
   packets will be dropped unless identified as part of an ongoing 
   session that was initiated from within the private network. 
   Since NAT behavior is not standardized, vendor specific NATs can act 
   differently in this regard. For example, some NATs implement 
   endpoint-independent mapping where the same public IP address and 
   port are used for communication with any host on the Internet. Other  
  
 
Rahman, et al.        Expires – August 28, 2007                [Page 22] 
 
Internet Draft        Transport of MIH Messages        February 28, 2007 
    
    
   NATs implement address-dependent and port-dependent mappings where 
   the NAT reuses the same public IP and port for successive packets to 
   a specific external IP and port. 
    
   Moreover, NATs tend to delete the binding of <private IP, private 
   port> tuple to <public IP, public port> if packets are not exchanged 
   between the peers during a certain configurable time interval. NATs 
   can have different keep-alive time depending on their implementation 
   or configuration. 
    
   It is important to note that MIH payload (to be transported over IP) 
   does not carry IP address or port related information, hence no 
   Application Layer Gateway is required on the NAT. Therefore, the 
   faced NAT challenge related to MIH transport is to setup a peer-to-
   peer communication between MIH enabled nodes. Because NATs’ 
   functionalities vary, the best NAT solution should be adopted from 
   the existing NAT traversal techniques. The following section 
   discusses two main scenarios of the NAT deployment and possible 
   traversal solution – the initiator (MIH enabled MN) of a 
   communication is behind a NAT, and both the MIH enabled nodes (MN and 
   MM) are behind NATs. 
    
   In the network model shown in Section 5, the MM is a discrete entity 
   which provides services once an MN discovers and starts a session 
   with it. Since the MM provides MIH services to many MNs, the MM 
   should be easily reachable (by MNs), thus in a typical deployment 
   scenario, an MM would not be behind a NAT. In the case where an MN 
   behind a NAT initiates a session with the MM (which is not behind a 
   NAT), incoming packets from the MM (to the MN) will traverse the NAT 
   with no problems. This is because these packets will be identified as 
   part of 
   an ongoing session that was initiated from within the NAT. Therefore 
   no changes should be done to NATs to support MIH remote message 
   exchange. However, the MN should send keep-alive messages to the MM 
   in order to ensure that the NAT keeps the same binding of <private 
   IP, private port> tuple to the <public IP, public port> tuple.   
    
   Even though it is not foreseen that MM may also be behind a NAT, this 
   possibility is nevertheless considered. There are several solutions 
   for clients, behind NATs, that want to establish peer-to-peer 
   communication (over UDP/IP). 
   One widely used solution is the “UDP Hole Punching” technique which 
   uses a server (third party, usually a STUN [6] server) with a 
   reachable public IP address to establish direct (un-relayed) 
   communication between clients behind NATs. 
   Another solution is to use a third party relay server that relays MIH 
   messages between two peers in question. This is useful when NATs have  
    
  
 
Rahman, et al.        Expires – August 28, 2007                [Page 23] 
 
Internet Draft        Transport of MIH Messages        February 28, 2007 
    
    
   an address and port dependent mapping behavior. A STUN server can be 
   used as a relay server as discussed in [7]. 
    
   It is evident that NATs’ behaviors are not standardized and therefore 
   particular NAT traversal solutions might not work with certain NATs. 
   However, [8] defines a set of requirements that (expectedly) makes 
   NATs generally more “friendly” to applications. For both scenarios 
   i.e. whether one or both MIH capable nodes are behind NATs, the most 
   suitable NAT traversal solution should be adopted, and this depends 
   on the type of NATs that are deployed within networks. 
    
    
   13.  Fragmentation  
        
   There are three MIH services (as specified in IEEE 802.21), Event, 
   Command, and Information Services. Event and Command Service messages 
   are usually small in size and therefore a UDP datagram carrying such 
   a message will not require fragmentation. The size of Information 
   Service message can be larger than that of Event or Command Service 
   messages; however the recommendation in IEEE 802.21 is to use 
   Information Services that are as small as possible to satisfy a 
   handover operation. In the case where a message carrying an 
   Information Service is larger than the MTU, fragmentation may be done 
   at the IP layer. In IP fragmentation, the loss of one IP fragment 
   requires the retransmission of the original UDP datagram. Thus, the 
   application retransmission timers defined in this document could be 
   used with IP fragmentation (if needed) to trigger retransmissions in 
   the event of lost IP fragments.   
    
    
   14.  Security Considerations  
        
   MIH remote messaging obviously involves the sending and receiving of 
   messages. As a result, the security problems related to messaging in 
   general are relevant here. MMs and MNS should use the appropriate   
   IPSec features for all MIH message exchanges. IPSec provides security 
   (at the network layer) for the application and transport layers and 
   its main features are authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and 
   anti-replay. IPsec is obligatory for IPv6 and is optional for IPv4. 
   After the discovery of the MM by an MN, both peers can perform the 
   Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol which is an important step of 
   the IPSec security protocol. It allows the MM and MN to agree on the 
   authentication and encryption methods. The peers also agree on a 
   security key to use and the duration of its use before replacing the 
   key with a new one. The IPSec Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) 
   can thus be used to authenticate MIH messages, provide 
   confidentiality, integrity, and protection against replay attacks. 
   Also, the IPSec Authentication Header (AH) can be used to provide

   authentication, integrity, and anti-replay, but no confidentiality. 
   Also, ESP and AH can be used in combination at the same time. 
    
   However, if an MIH capable node is behind a NAT, IPSec AH must not be 
   used since it protects the outer IP address and is thus incompatible 
   with NATs. In such a scenario, IPSec ESP should be used and should be 
   encapsulated in UDP as discussed in [9]. 
     
    
   15.  IANA Considerations  
        
   IANA is requested to assign a value for the UDP MIH Application Port 
   Number in accordance with [5].
