Abstract

   This draft discusses when it is appropriate to register and utilize
   an Autonomous System (AS), and lists criteria for such.  ASes are the
   unit of routing policy in the modern world of exterior routing, and
   are specifically applicable to protocols like EGP (Exterior Gateway
   Protocol, now at historical status; see [EGP]), BGP (Border Gateway
   Protocol, the current de facto standard for inter-AS routing; see
   [BGP-4]), and IDRP (The OSI Inter-Domain Routing Protocol, which the
   Internet will eventually adopt when BGP becomes obsolete; see
   [IDRP]). It should be noted that the IDRP equivalent of an AS is the
   RDI, or Routing Domain Identifier.

1. Introduction

   This memo discusses when it is appropriate to register and utilize an
   Autonomous System (AS), and lists criteria for such.  ASes are the
   unit of routing policy in the modern world of exterior routing, and
   are specifically applicable to protocols like EGP (Exterior Gateway
   Protocol, now at historical status; see [EGP]), BGP (Border Gateway
   Protocol, the current de facto standard for inter-AS routing; see
   [BGP-4]), and IDRP (The OSI Inter-Domain Routing Protocol, which the
   Internet will eventually adopt when BGP becomes obsolete; see
   [IDRP]). It should be noted that the IDRP equivalent of an AS is the

2. Motivation

   This memo is aimed at network operators and service providers who need
   to understand under what circumstances they should make use of an
   AS. It is expected that the reader is familiar with routing protocols
   and will be someone who configures and operates Internet
   networks. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of confusion in how
   ASes should be used today; this memo attempts to clear up some of this
   confusion, as well as acting as a simple guide to today's exterior
   routing.


3. Definitions

   This document refers to the term ``prefix'' throughout. In the current
   classless Internet (see [CIDR]), a block of class A, B, or C networks
   may be referred to by merely a prefix and a mask, so long as such a
   block of networks begins and ends on a power-of-two boundary. For
   example, the networks:

        192.168.0.0/24
        192.168.1.0/24
        192.168.2.0/24
        192.168.3.0/24

   can be simply referred to as:

        192.168.0.0/22

   The term ``prefix'' as it is used here is equivalent to ``CIDR
   block'', and in simple terms may be thought of as a group of one
   or more networks. We use the term ``network'' to mean classful
   network, or ``A, B, C network''.

   The definition of AS has been unclear and ambiguous for some
   time.  [BGP-4] states:


        The classic definition of an Autonomous System is a set of
        routers under a single technical administration, using an inte-
        rior gateway protocol and common metrics to route packets within
        the AS, and using an exterior gateway protocol to route packets
        to other ASes.  Since this classic definition was developed, it
        has become common for a single AS to use several interior gate-
        way protocols and sometimes several sets of metrics within an
        AS.  The use of the term Autonomous System here stresses the
        fact that, even when multiple IGPs and metrics are used, the
        administration of an AS appears to other ASes to have a single

        coherent interior routing plan and presents a consistent picture
        of what networks are reachable through it.


   To rephrase succinctly:

        An AS is a connected group of IP networks run by one or more
        network operators which has a SINGLE and CLEARLY DEFINED routing
        policy.

   Routing policy here is defined as how routing decisions are made in
   the Internet today.  It is the exchange of routing information
   between ASes that is subject to routing policies. Consider the case
   of two ASes, X and Y exchanging routing information:


                NET1 ......  ASX  <--->  ASY  ....... NET2


   ASX knows how to reach a prefix called NET1.  It does not matter
   whether NET1 belongs to ASX or to some other AS which exchanges rout-
   ing information with ASX, either directly or indirectly; we just
   assume that ASX knows how to direct packets towards NET1.  Likewise
   ASY knows how to reach NET2.

   In order for traffic from NET2 to NET1 to flow between ASX and ASY,
   ASX has to announce NET1 to ASY using an exterior routing protocol;
   this means that ASX is willing to accept traffic directed to NET1
   from ASY. Policy comes into play when ASX decides to announce NET1 to
   ASY.

   For traffic to flow, ASY has to accept this routing information and
   use it.  It is ASY's privilege to either use or disregard the infor-
   mation that it receives from ASX about NET1's reachability. ASY might
   decide not to use this information if it does not want to send
   traffic to NET1 at all or if it considers another route more
   appropriate to reach NET1.

   In order for traffic in the direction of NET1 to flow between ASX and
   ASY, ASX must announce that route to ASY and ASY must accept it from
   ASX:

                    resulting packet flow towards NET1
                  <<===================================
                                    |
                                    |
                     announce NET1  |  accept NET1
                    --------------> + ------------->
                                    |
                        AS X        |    AS Y
                                    |
                     <------------- + <--------------
                       accept NET2  |  announce NET2
                                    |
                                    |
                   resulting packet flow towards NET2
                   ===================================>>


   Ideally, and seldom practically, the announcement and acceptance pol-
   icies of ASX and ASY are identical.

   In order for traffic towards NET2 to flow, announcement and accep-
   tance of NET2 must be in place (mirror image of NET1). For almost all
   applications connectivity in just one direction is not useful at all.

   It should be noted that, in more complex topologies than this exam-
   ple, traffic from NET1 to NET2 may not necessarily take the same path
   as traffic from NET2 to NET1; this is called asymmetrical routing.
   Asymmetrical routing is not inherently bad, but can often cause per-
   formance problems for higher level protocols, such as TCP, and should
   be used with caution.

   It is important to realise that with current destination based for-
   warding technology routing policies must eventually be expressed in
   these terms.

   Policies are not configured for each prefix separately but for groups
   of prefixes.  These groups of prefixes are ASes.

   An AS has a globally unique number (sometimes referred to as an ASN,
   or Autonomous System Number) associated with it; this number is used
   in both the exchange of exterior routing information (between neigh-
   boring ASes), and as an identifier of the AS itself.

   In routing terms, an AS will normally use one or more interior gate-
   way protocols (IGPs) when exchanging reachability information within
   its own AS. See ``IGP Issues''.

4. Common errors in allocating ASes

   The term AS is often confused or even misused as a convenient way of
   grouping together a set of prefixes which belong under the same
   administrative umbrella, even if within that group of prefixes there
   are various different routing policies. Without exception, an AS must
   have only one routing policy.

   It is essential that careful consideration and coordination be
   applied during the creation of an AS. Using an AS merely for the sake
   of having an AS is to be avoided, as is the worst-case scenario of
   one AS per classful network (the IDEAL situation is to have one pre-
   fix, containing many networks, per AS). This may mean that some re-
   engineering may be required in order to apply the criteria and guide-
   lines for creation and allocation of an AS that we list below;
   nevertheless, doing so is probably the only way to implement the
   desired routing policy.

   If you are currently engineering an AS, careful thought should be
   taken to register appropriately sized CIDR blocks with your registra-
   tion authority in order to minimize the number of advertised prefixes
   from your AS.  In the perfect world that number can , and should, be
   as low as one.

   Some router implementations use an AS number as a form of tagging to
   identify interior as well as exterior routing processes.  This tag
   does not need to be unique unless routing information is indeed
   exchanged with other ASes. See ``IGP Issues''.


5. Criteria for the decision -- do I need an AS?


   *    Exchange of external routing information

        An AS must be used for exchanging external routing information
        with other ASes through an exterior routing protocol. The
        current recommended exterior routing protocol is BGP, the Border
        Gateway Protocol. However, the exchange of external routing
        information alone does not constitute the need for an AS. See
        ``Sample Cases'' below.


   *    Many prefixes, one AS

        As a general rule, one should try to place as many prefixes as
        possible within a given AS, provided all of them conform to the
        same routing policy.

INTERNET-DRAFT      Guidelines for creation of an AS       February 1995


   *    Unique routing policy

        As AS is only needed when you have a routing policy which is
        different from that of your border gateway peers. Here routing
        policy refers to how the rest of the Internet makes routing
        decisions based on information from your AS. See ``Sample
        Cases'' below to see exactly when this criteria will apply.


5.1 Sample Cases


   *    Single-homed site, single prefix

        A separate AS is not needed; the prefix should be placed in an
        AS of the provider. The site's prefix has exactly the same rout-
        ing policy as the other customers of the site's service pro-
        vider, and there is no need to make any distinction in routing
        information.

        This idea may at first seem slightly alien to some, but it
        highlights the clear distinction in the use of the AS number as
        a representation of routing policy as opposed to some form of
        administrative use.

        In some situations, a single site, or piece of a site, may find
        it necessary to have a policy different from that of its pro-
        vider, or the rest of the site. In such an instance, a separate
        AS must be created for the affected prefixes. This situation is
        rare and should almost never happen. Very few stub sites require
        different routing policies than their parents. Because the AS is
        the unit of policy, however, this sometimes occurs.


   *    Single-homed site, multiple prefixes

        Again, a separate AS is not needed; the prefixes should be
        placed in an AS of the site's provider.


   *    Multi-homed site

        Here multi-homed is taken to mean a prefix or group of prefixes
        which connects to more than one service provider (i.e. more than
        one AS with its own routing policy). It does not mean a network
        multi-homed running an IGP for the purposes of resilience.

        An AS is required; the site's prefixes should be part of a



Hawkinson & Bates        Expires 5 August, 1995                 [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT      Guidelines for creation of an AS       February 1995


        single AS, distinct from the ASes of its service providers.
        This allows the customer the ability to have a different
        representation of policy and preference among the different ser-
        vice providers.

        This is ALMOST THE ONLY case where a network operator should
        create its own AS number. In this case, the site should ensure
        that it has the necessary facilities to run appropriate routing
        protocols, such as BGP4.


5.2 Other factors


   *    Topolgy

        Routing policy decisions such as geography, AUP (Acceptable Use
        Policy) compliance and network topology can influence decisions
        of AS creation. However, all too often these are done without
        consideration of whether or not an AS is needed in terms of
        adding additional information for routing policy decisions by
        the rest of the Internet. Careful consideration should be taken
        when basing AS creation on these type of criteria.


   *    Transition / ``future-proofing''

        Often a site will be connected to a single service provider but
        has plans to connect to another at some point in the future.
        This is not enough of a reason to create an AS before you really
        need it.  The AS number space is finite and the limited amount
        of re-engineering needed when you connect to another service
        provider should be considered as a natural step in transition.


   *    History

        AS number application forms have historically made no reference
        to routing policy. All too often ASes have been created purely
        because it was seen as ``part of the process'' of connecting to
        the Internet. The document should act as reference to future
        application forms to show clearly when an AS is needed.


6. Speculation


   1) If provider A and provider B have a large presence in a



Hawkinson & Bates        Expires 5 August, 1995                 [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT      Guidelines for creation of an AS       February 1995


   geographical area (or other routing domain), and many customers are
   multi-homed between them, it makes sense for all of those customers
   to be placed within the same AS. However, it is noted that case
   should only be looked at if practical to do so and fully coordinated
   between customers and service providers involved.

   2) Sites should not be forced to place themselves in a separate AS
   just so that someone else (externally) can make AS-based policy deci-
   sions. Nevertheless, it may occasionally be necessary to split up an
   AS or a prefix into two ASes for policy reasons. Those making exter-
   nal policy may request the network operators make such AS changes,
   but the final decision is up to those network operators who manage
   the prefixes in question, as well as the ASes containing them. This
   is, of course, a trade off -- it will not always be possible to
   implement all desired routing policies.


7. One prefix, one origin AS

   Generally, a prefix can should belong to only one AS. This is a
   direct consequence of the fact that at each point in the Internet
   there can be exactly one routing policy for traffic destined to each
   prefix. In the case of an prefix which is used in neighbor peering
   between two ASes, a conscious decision should be made as to which AS
   this prefix actually resides in.

   With the introduction of aggregation it should be noted that an AS
   can occasionally be represented as residing in more than one AS, how-
   ever, this is very much the exception rather than the rule. This hap-
   pens when aggregating using the AS_SET attribute in BGP, wherein the
   concept of origin is lost. In some cases the origin AS is lost alto-
   gether if there is a less specific aggregate announcement setting the
   ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute.


8. IGP Issues

   As stated above, many router vendors require an identifier for tag-
   ging their IGP processes. However, this tag does not need to be glo-
   bally unique. In practice this information is never seen by exterior
   routing protocols. If already running an exterior routing protocol,
   it is perfectly reasonable to use your AS number as an IGP tag; if
   you do not, choosing a random value is acceptable. Merely running an
   IGP is not grounds for registration of an AS number.

   With the advent of BGP4 it becomes necessary to use an IGP that can
   carry classless routes. Examples include OSPF [OSPF] and ISIS [ISIS].

INTERNET-DRAFT      Guidelines for creation of an AS       February 1995


9. AS Space exhaustion

   The AS number space is a finite amount of address space. It is
   currently defined as a 16 bit integer and hence limited to 65535
   unique AS numbers. At the time of writing some 3,700 ASes have been
   allocated and a little under 400 ASes are actively routed in the glo-
   bal Internet. It is clear that this growth needs to be continually
   monitored. However, if the criteria applied above are adhered to,
   then there is no immediate danger of AS space exhaustion. It is
   expected that IDRP will be deployed before this becomes an issue.
   IDRP does not have a fixed limit on the size of an RDI.


10. Security Considerations

   There are few security concerns regarding the selection of ASes.

   AS number to owner mappings are public knowledge (in WHOIS), and
   attempting to change that would serve only to confuse those people
   attempting to route IP traffic on the Internet.
