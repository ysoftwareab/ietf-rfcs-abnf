Abstract 
   
   This  Internet Draft has arisen  out of  work  concentrating  on  the 
   interconnection  of IP  and the  Public  Switched  Telephone  Network 
   (PSTN) undertaken within the PINT working group.  Efforts within this 
   group have,  to date, concentrated on the initiation of PSTN services 
   from the Internet.

   This Internet Draft aims  to describe a possible architecture for the
   implementation of services initiated from  the PSTN such as,  but not
   limited  to,  Internet Call Waiting  (ICW).  It also  identifies  the
   possibility  of using this class of service,  in conjunction with the 
   PINT work already undertaken,  in order to provide a third flavour of 
   service.

   This Internet Draft deliberately does not to define the protocols for 
   these kinds of services, although descriptions contained within it do
   use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) terminology. 

   The purpose  of this  Internet Draft  is to  ascertain  the level  of 
   interest in pursuing this area of work. It is submitted with the goal 
   of forming the basis of an Informational RFC and thereby further work
   on the standardisation of the  provision of  these kinds of services.

2. Introduction

   In its charter, the description of the PINT working group states that
   it  aims to address  connection arrangements  through which  Internet 
   applications can request and enrich PSTN services.  

   Work to date has produced a  proposal based on the use of the Session

   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2] and  Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [3] to achieve these objectives in respect  of Internet initiation of
   PSTN services (as shown in Figure 1).

                              Figure 1.

   As a result  of this work  the group has  identified a need,  and has 
   begun  discussions  on,  the  possibility of using  SIP and  SDP in a 
   similar  manner in order to perform the reverse of this function i.e. 
   initiating  Internet  services from  the PSTN  using some  yet to  be
   defined protocol (initially called TNIP, it being the reverse of PINT
   [4]) as shown in Figure 2.  

                     ............................
                     :                          :
                     : +----------+   REQUEST   :+----------+
                     : | Internet |<------------:|   PSTN   |
                     : +----------+    TNIP     :| Services |
                     :                          :+----------+
                     :..........................:

                              Figure 2.

   The service  initially identified  for this scenario is the  Internet 
   Call Waiting (ICW) Service,  also known  as Call  Completion Internet 
   Busy (CCIB).  In this service,  a PSTN user attempts  to make a Plain 
   Old Telephone Service (POTS)  call in a traditional manner to another 
   number. This second number is engaged, possibly because the person is 
   presently  connected to the Internet.  The service should identify if 
   this user is indeed connected, and if so,  a message is sent over the 
   Internet to  inform this person about the call attempt.  The user may  
   then decide  what action to take, dependent on  what  service options 
   are  provided  by the service  provider.  This might  be to  drop the 
   current Internet connection and take the call in the normal way, take  
   the call as a Voice Over IP (VOIP) call, decline and give the calling  
   party the option to leave a voice message or simply decline the call.

   Of course this is not the only service which could be deployed, other
   services, such as : 

      o Remote Activation
        Using a  telephone a user could request actions  to be performed 
        at some remote location.


Buller                                                          [Page 3]
<draft-ietf-pint-saint-00.txt>   PSTN Initiated Services     March, 1999

      o Remote Data Setting
        Using a telephone a user could create or modify information held
        on a remote machine.
 
      o Paging 
        A paging service could send a text message to the user logged on 
        to the Internet using voice to text conversion software.

      o Voice Messaging
        A voice message service, whereby a voice message could  be taken 
        and  converted to an audio  format which could be played  on the 
        users machine.

      o Voice to Email.

   could also be deployed.  

   However, the real benefits of this class of service (PSTN activation)
   will be in its use,  in conjunction with the work  already undertaken
   within the PINT group,  to provide a further completely  new class of
   Intelligent Network  (IN) 'like' services.  This scenario is depicted 
   in Figure 3 :
                     ............................
                     :                          :
                     : +----------+   REQUEST   :+----------+
                     : |          |<------------:|          |
                     : | Internet |             :|   PSTN   |
                     : | services |             :| Services |
                     : |          |------------>:|          |
                     : +----------+   PINT      :+----------+
                     :                REQUEST   :
                     :..........................:

                              Figure 3.

   The scenario of these kinds of services would be that a user uses the 
   PSTN  to initiate an  Internet service.  This Internet service  could 
   then either :
  
       Store information which  could be used  during an initation of an 
       Internet Service at a some later time. 
   or
       Initiate a PSTN service directly. 
   
   A simple  example of a service using both of these facets might  be a 
   number portability service. A user  could use a telephone to  specify
   the telephone number at their current location (perhaps using Calling 
   Line Identity CLI) this is sent over the Internet (using the protocol
   which would  come out of any  future work)  to a repository.  Another 
   user could then attempt to telephone the  first  user.  This  call is
   intercepted and the number called checked  against the  current known
   location by a request (using the protocol or profile which would come
   out of any  future work)  to ascertain the  number registered  by the
   first user.  If the  number is  different,  a PINT  request  could be 

Buller                                                          [Page 4]
<draft-ietf-pint-saint-00.txt>   PSTN Initiated Services     March, 1999

   issued back to the PSTN to connect the call to the new number.

   For the purposes of this Internet Draft and  identifying what kind of
   services  are being  disussed  this  Internet Draft identifies  three 
   groups of service which could be provided :

     1. PINT    Internet initiation of PSTN servives.

     2. TNIP    The  reverse of PINT  i.e.  PSTN  Initiation of Internet 
                services and the protocol or profile which could provide
                these services.

     3. SAINT   Service Activation and the INTernet. An all encompassing 
                classification which  contains services provided  by the
                previous  two groups,  plus  any  combination  of  these 
                services, used to provide further services.

   Figure 4. provides a schematic of the different kinds of service.

                                 SAINT
                   Service Activation on the INTernet
                                   |
                  +----------------+----------------+
                  |                                 |
                 PINT                              TNIP
             PSTN INTernet                  Telephony iNitiation
             Interworking                     of IP services

                              Figure 4.

   So,  in the number  portability serice  described above,  the service 
   components would break down as follows :

     o The  ability to call and set current  location (telephone number) 
       would be a TNIP  flavour of SAINT which could be used in multiple
       services. 

     o Similarly, the ability to look up the present location would also
       be a TNIP flavour of SAINT, as this would have been initiated via
       the PSTN. This also could be used in multiple services. 

     o The ability to forward the  call would be a PINT flavour of SAINT
       because  this would  be initiated from  the Internet. Again, this
       functionality could be used in multiple services.

     o The whole combination of the above would be a SAINT service. 
        
   Eventually,  if further  work  in  this area  is undertaken,  what is 
   presently  considered to be independent services within the  PINT and 
   TNIP class of service,  might be seen  more as functional  components 
   within a SAINT architecture of service provision.

   This Internet Draft will not consider the potential for PINT and TNIP 
   combination  kinds  of  SAINT  services  further.  The mechanism  for  

Buller                                                          [Page 5]
<draft-ietf-pint-saint-00.txt>   PSTN Initiated Services     March, 1999

   providing  these  should 'fall  out'  of any work  undertaken  in the 
   standardisation of PSTN initiated or TNIP services. 

3. General Requirements For PSTN Initiation Of Internet Services

   This section  aims to specify an  initial set of requirements for any 
   future work in the specification of a protocol, or implementation of,
   the group of PSTN initiated services identified in Section 2.

     o The profile should provide the service in a secure manner.

     o Any profile defined for PSTN initiation  of services should reuse
       where possible  existing IETF protocols. In particular, a profile
       for the PSTN  initiation of  services should be aligned with  the 
       PINT profile work undertaken to date.

     o The  identification of  any equipment (external to the  Internet)
       within the  specification  of the protocol,  or, service  defined 
       using  this protocol  SHOULD NOT  be required. This  would  be in 
       accordance  with  the  PINT  approach to  date  which  places  no        
       requirements and identifies no specific equipment beyond the PINT
       gateway.

     o Provide the possibility for a service to be activated in a manner 
       which  is  independent in  both  location  of  service and  user. 
       Section 5 describes  one possible ICW implementation which allows 
       a user to use the ICW  service in a portable manner  without that 
       service being  tied to a  specific telephone  number (and thereby 
       service location).  User (the caller) location  can be considered 
       to be location independent for this service.

4. Proposed Architecture

   The proposed architecture contains three main elements :

     1) The user's machine.
        This contains  a TNIP  Server to  receive INVITE  and/ or NOTIFY 
        messages.  What action occurs  next can be either  predetermined  
        by the service provider or dictated by the user themselves.  

     2) Information/ Service Repository.  
        This  could  contain  the  service provider's services,  service
        related  information,  subscriber related information  or indeed
        accounting information. In Figure 5 this element is indicated as
        a single entity,  where in fact, it may be comprised of  several
        servers working together to provide the overall service. 

        These  functions  receive INVITEs  from the  TNIP client,  check
        where  to  send  the  message  and  perform  any  other  service 
        functionality.  Next, the INVITE is forwarded to the TNIP server
        on the user's machine. These functions also receive REGISTRATION
        messages sent  from the TNIP  Server on  the user's  machine and 
        maintain/store  any  relevent  information  contained  in  these 
        messages.  

Buller                                                          [Page 6]
<draft-ietf-pint-saint-00.txt>   PSTN Initiated Services     March, 1999

     3) TNIP Gateway.
        This  'could'  receive  service   requests  from  the  PSTN  and 
        formulates TNIP messages  to be  forwarded to  the  Information/
        Service Repository  or directly to the TNIP Server  on the users 
        machine. In so doing it acts as a TNIP client.

   A simplistic schematic of these  elements is shown in Figure 5 below.

               +--------------+
 
                              Figure 5.

   One  thing to note about this  architecture is that the  Information/ 
   Service Repository is not necessarily required.  A User machine could 
   handle  a service itself if the TNIP client were to issue INVITEs and 
   NOTIFYs to it directly. 

   The function of the information/service repository itself could exist
   outside of  the scope of interest demarcation indicated,  as proposed 
   in [5]. 

   Maintaining  the information/ service repository  within the Internet 

Buller                                                          [Page 7]
<draft-ietf-pint-saint-00.txt>   PSTN Initiated Services     March, 1999

   as  indicated however,  would permit  interoperability  with the work   
   presently  being undertaken  within the IP Telephony  (IPTEL) working 
   group, specifically the proposed Call Processing Language [6].

   Another point of  note is that the TNIP boxes on the user machine and
   connected to  the Gateway Function  are indicated  as Client/ Server.
   This is because the description of the implementation falls  into two 
   parts  (see Section 5) and the  behaviour of these TNIP boxes is more 
   client or server like in each phase.

5. Implementation Scenarios 

   This section describes  how services might be implemented  within the
   architecture described in the previous section. The order of flows is 
   identified  though the specific  contents is not.  As has been stated
   previously, this  draft  aims to  ascertain the level of interest  in
   this architecture and  the services it  could provide,  prior to work 
   on any  actual specification of a protocol  which will be required to 
   support them. 

   To reduce complexity the description is in two parts.  First the user 
   registers for the service. Secondly, a call attempt is made.

5.1.1 Other issues

  As previously stated messages 1 and 3, and the function performed by 2
  do not  need to be located in what  is called in this  description the 
  Information/ Service repository. These flows and the  registration may
  be undertaken within the telephony network using IN [5].

  The implemenation  scenario described assumes that TNIP  functionality
  has at some  previous time been downloaded to the user's machine. This 
  need  not be  the case.  If it were  required  that a user  could gain 
  access to  the Internet using  any machine  and still  have access  to 
  these services, an implementation similar to that identified in Figure
  7. and the following paragraph could be employed.

    1. The user  goes to a  service  providers  URL using a  browser and 
       specifies the information requested such as, in the case  of ICW,
       telephone number.

    2. The  service provider  constructs and issues  a SIP  registration 
       message on behalf of the user.

    3. User details provided are registered.

    4. A response  message is  constructed  and returned to  registering 
       Client.

    5. Response message returned to service provider's Web Server.

    6. A 'thin' TNIP User Server Agent is sent to the user machine. This 
       can then be used in the service activation phase.

       The term 'thin' means that a full implementation of a TNIP server
       need not be required in order to handle  specific requests.  This
       is because  of two  main reasons.  Firstly,  the exact  format of 
       messages which may be sent by the service provider to offer  this
       service  is known. Secondly,  only a subset of  the full protocol
       need be required to provide the service.

    1.  A service activation request. For example an ICW service request         
        is  made  after a  call  has been  attempted and  the  PSTN  has 
        recognised  that the number  is engaged.   An announcement could 
        be played  and a request sent from the  Gateway to  establish if 
        the  user is currently registered as wanting to receive  INVITEs 
        for a particular service.  This will not be discussed further as 
        it is outside the scope of this Internet Draft.

    2.  A TNIP  invitation message  is constructed and  sent to the TNIP 
        Server on the information/ service handler.

    3.  The TNIP  server in the information/ service repository looks up 
        the registration details of the user. Two things may then occur.
        If the user  has registered  details a  TNIP invitation could be 
        forwarded to the  TNIP server on the user's machine (see 4a). In 
        this  case  the information/ service  repository  performs  as a 
        redirection  server or proxy.  If the  user has no  registration 
        information in  the  database  (either  because  they  have  not 
        registered or the  registration has expired)  a failure response
        is sent to the requesting TNIP client (see 4b).

    4a. A TNIP  invitation message  is sent  by the  TNIP Server  on the 
        information/ service  repository.  This  invitation  contains  a
        combination of  information contained within the  repository and 
        information contained in the original request.

    4b. A TNIP  failure  response  is returned  to the  requesting  TNIP
        client as no current regration information could be found.

    5.  User  or  service action  to  dictate  what should  happen  as a 
        result of the receipt the TNIP request.  In ICW this might be to 
        provide the user with the following options :

            Take telephony call
            Take VOIP call
            Send to voice mail
            Refuse connection

    6.  The user sends a response to the INVITE,  a final timeout occurs
        or the client gives up.

5.2.1 Other issues

   As with  the Service  Registration Phase  the flows  to and  from the 
   information/ service repository  and the actions it performs could be 
   undertaken within the telephony network using IN [5].  The only flows
   in this  scenario would be the invite 4a and the response 6.

 
6. Security Considerations 
   
   Security  issues are  still an  open issue  within the PINT  Internet 
   Draft itself.  It is expected that much of the  security arrangements 
   finally proposed by the PINT Internet Draft will be replicated within 

Buller                                                         [Page 11]
<draft-ietf-pint-saint-00.txt>   PSTN Initiated Services     March, 1999

   any  further work  undertaken to provide the  services identified  in 
   this Internet Draft.

   However,  due to the nature of implementation of these services there 
   are a number of security issues that need to be addressed. These are:

     o De-registration.

     o Claiming another number (somebody else's) by accident or design.

6.1. De-registration
   The de-registration problem would arise if a user did not de-register
   themselves before  they finished  using the Internet,  likely to be a 
   common  occurrence e.g.  users turning  off their  machines or modems
   without de-registering. It is expected that any implementation builds
   in a mechanism to handle this scenario.  Authenticators could be used
   and passed in  responses to the  REGISTER  messages sent  to the TNIP 
   service  on the  users machine.  Alternatively,  these authenticators 
   could be  placed directly  in the TNIP  server when  it is  initially  
   downloaded. 

   When the user  logs off the  Internet, without de-registering,  there 
   are  three scenarios which could  happen when  an attempt is made  to 
   place a call to the number the user specified as their location :

     1) The line  is not busy,  therefore place the call and  remove any
        previously held registrations.

     2) The line  is busy on a voice call.  An attempt to send a  INVITE
        message from the Information/ Service Repository fails (as there
        would be no receiving client).  Any previously held registration
        for this number is removed.

     3) Another user (or the same user on a different  Internet session)
        has registered  for receipt of  calls on this number.  There are 
        two solution possibilities :
 
          a) When  the  new  registration is  made the  old  is replaced 
             immediately.

        or

          b) The new  registration is kept until an  Authenticator fails
             on  the  TNIP server  of the  new  registrand  when a  call 
             attempt is made.  When  the Authenticator  fails the INVITE  
             fails and  the  original  registration can  be removed  and 
             replaced with the new. The INVITE is then resent to the new 
             registrand.

6.2. Claiming another number by accident or design.

   In this scenario  a user may attempt to use ICW to claim notification 
   on a line they have no right to,  and possibly handle that call using 
   VoIP,  if the actual line is engaged. Consider the potential criminal 

Buller                                                         [Page 12]
<draft-ietf-pint-saint-00.txt>   PSTN Initiated Services     March, 1999

   activities of claiming the telephone number of a Bank.  This security
   issue is  much more complex.  The following options are  suggested as 
   possible solutions :

     1) Only allow this kind of access from the user's own phone.

     2) Provide functionality at the ISP to get the  CLI and implement a 
        SIP based mechanism to request this from the ISP. 

     3) Good accounting to track down offenders.
 
     4) Only provide  the option  to drop  the Internet  connection  and 
        establish  a POTS  call on  untrusted (e.g.  not home)  numbers. 
        Normal Bank authentication procedeures could then be used.

7. Conclusions

   There is a perceived requirement for the provision of services which, 
   whilst  running over the Internet, would be initiated from the  PSTN. 
   This Internet  Draft has proposed  an initial attempt at  defining an 
   architecture for the provision of such services.

   This Internet Draft  has also identified  that these services  may be 
   used in conjunction with PINT services in order to provide a new kind
   of IN 'like' services with their logic operating within  the Internet 
   domain.

   It has also been  identified that  the architecture  outlined in this
   Internet  Draft permits service users to specify data which can  then 
   be used by  services during execution. An extension to this approach, 
   and a  possible area of further work would be to  investigate how the 
   ability of users to define their services as proposed in [6] could be
   integrated with the initiation of a service from the PSTN.

   Much further work would be required in defining a TNIP style protocol 
   or profile and  identifying  possible services  for this  protocol or 
   profile. Identfying and specifying  candidate services which use both 
   the  TNIP  and  PINT  protocols,  such  as  the  portability  service 
   described earlier, would also require further work.

   Finally,  neither PINT nor this proposal  for a TNIP protocol address
   the issue  of generalised/spontaneous notifications  between the PSTN
   and IP domains.  These notifications may be  in the form service data
   or status information. Further work is required to identify how these
   notifications are sent,  what handles these messages and how they are 
   handled. It may be that PINT can be used to forward these messages to
   a TNIP server and vice versa.
