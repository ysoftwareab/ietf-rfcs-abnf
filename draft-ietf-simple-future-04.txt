Abstract

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic XML
   format for presenting presence information for a presentity.  This
   document extends PIDF, adding a timed status extension (<timed-
   status> element) that allows a presentity to declare its status for a
   time interval fully in the future or the past.

Internet-Draft               Timed Presence                    June 2005


1.  Introduction

   Traditionally, presence information, e.g., represented as PIDF [3]
   and RPID [6], describes the current state of the presentity.
   However, a watcher can better plan communications if it knows about
   the presentity's future plans.  For example, if a watcher knows that
   the presentity is about to travel, it might place a phone call
   earlier.

   RPID already allows a presentity to indicate the period when a
   particular aspect of its presence is valid.  However, the <status>
   element in the PIDF <tuple> does not have this facility, so that it
   is not possible to indicate that a presentity will be OPEN or CLOSED
   in the future, for example.

   It is also occasionally useful to represent past information since it
   may be the only known presence information; it may give watchers an
   indication of the current status.  For example, indicating that the
   presentity was at an off-site meeting that ended an hour ago
   indicates that the presentity is likely in transit at the current
   time.

   It is unfortunately not possible to simply add time range attributes
   to the PIDF <status> element, as PIDF parsers without this capability
   would ignore thes attributes and thus not be able to distinguish
   current from future presence status information.

   This document defines the <timed-status> element that describes the
   status of a presentity that is either no longer valid or covers some
   future time period.

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
   RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted
   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].

3.  Timed-Status Element

   The <timed-status> element is a child of the <tuple> element and MUST
   NOT appear as a child of a PIDF <status> element or another <timed-
   status> element.  More than one such element MAY appear within a PIDF
   <tuple> element.

   Sources of <timed-status> information should avoid overlapping
   elements, but since overlapping appointments are common in calendars,
   for example, receivers MUST be able to render such overlapping
   <timed-status> indications.

   The <timed-status> element MUST be qualified with the 'from'
   attribute and MAY be qualified with an 'until' attribute to describe
   the time when the status assumed this value and the time until which
   this element is expected to be valid.  If the 'until' attribute is
   missing, the information is assumed valid until the tuple is
   explicitly overridden or expires as defined by the publication
   mechanism used.  The time range MUST NOT encompass the present time,
   i.e., the <timestamp> value, as that would provide an unnecessary and
   confusing alternate mechanism to describe presence.  Thus, the 'from'
   attribute for tuples without an 'until' attribute MUST refer to the
   future.

   During composition, a presence agent (PA) may encounter a stored
   <timed-status> elements that covers the present time.  The PA MAY
   either discard those elements or MAY convert it to a regular <status>
   element if it considers that information more credible.

   The <timed-status> element may contain the <basic> and <note>
   elements, as well as any other element that is appropriate as a PIDF
   <status> extension and that has a limited validity period.  Examples
   include the PIDF-LO [5] extensions for location objects.

   This extension chose absolute rather than relative times, since
   relative times would be too hard to keep properly updated when
   spacing notifications, for example.  Implementations SHOULD ascertain
   whether the time values in the <timed-status> elements are plausible,
   for example, by checking whether the time stamp in a notification
   protocol message corresponds to local time and by making sure that
   they are fully in the past or future, both relative to real time and
   the time contained in the optional PIDF <timestamp> element.

   An example combining PIDF and timed-status is shown below:

     urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:data-model data-model.xsd
     urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:timed-status timed-status.xsd"
     entity="pres:someone@example.com">

     <tuple id="c8dqui">
       <status>
         <basic>open</basic>
       </status>
       <ts:timed-status from="2005-08-15T10:20:00.000-05:00"
          until="2005-08-22T19:30:00.000-05:00">
          <ts:basic>closed</ts:basic>
       </ts:timed-status>
       <contact>sip:someone@example.com</contact>
     </tuple>
     <note>I'll be in Tokyo next week</note>
   </presence>

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document calls for IANA to register a new XML namespace URN and
   schema per [2].

6.1  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
     'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:timed-status'

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:timed-status

   Description: This is the XML namespace for XML elements defined by
      RFCXXXX to describe timed-status presence information extensions
      for the status element in the PIDF presence document format in the
      application/pidf+xml content type.
