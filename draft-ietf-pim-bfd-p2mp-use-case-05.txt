1.  Introduction

   Faster convergence in the control plane, in general, is beneficial
   and allows minimizing periods of traffic blackholing, transient
   routing loops, and other scenarios that may negatively affect service
   data flow.  That equally applies to unicast and multicast routing
   protocols.

   [RFC7761] is the current specification of the Protocol Independent
   Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) for IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
   Confirming implementation of PIM-SM elects a Designated Router (DR)
   on each PIM-SM interface.  When a group of PIM-SM nodes is connected
   to shared-media segment, e.g., Ethernet, the one elected as DR is to
   act on behalf of directly connected hosts in the context of the PIM-
   SM protocol.  Failure of the DR impacts the quality of the multicast
   services it provides to directly connected hosts because the default
   failure detection interval for PIM-SM routers is 105 seconds.
   Introduction of Backup DR (BDR), proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-pim-dr-improvement], improves convergence time in the PIM-
   SM over shared-media segment but still depends on long failure
   detection interval.

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] had been
   originally defined to detect failure of point-to-point (p2p) paths -
   single-hop [RFC5881], multihop [RFC5883].  In some PIM-SM

   deployments, a p2p BFD can be used to detect a failure and enable
   faster conversion.  [RFC8562] extends the BFD base specification
   [RFC5880] for multipoint and multicast networks, which precisely
   characterizes deployment scenarios for PIM-SM over a LAN segment.
   Among specific characteristics of p2mp BFD that are particularly
   benefit PIM-SM over a LAN segment is a faster transition to the Up
   state of the p2mp BFD session due to avoidance of the three-way
   handshake required in p2p BFD [RFC5880].  Also, because the router
   that transmits BFD Control messages uses the BFD Demand mode
   [RFC5880] it maintains less BFD state comparing to the Asynchronous
   mode.  This document demonstrates how point-to-multipoint (p2mp) BFD
   can enable faster detection of PIM-SM router failure and thus
   minimize multicast service disruption.  The document also defines the
   extension to PIM-SM [RFC7761] and [I-D.ietf-pim-dr-improvement] to
   bootstrap a PIM-SM router to join in p2mp BFD session over shared-
   media link.

Internet-Draft           BFD P2MP Use in PIM-SM            November 2020


2.  Problem Statement

   [RFC7761] does not provide a method for fast, e.g., sub-second,
   failure detection of a neighbor PIM-SM router.  BFD already has many
   implementations based on HW that are capable of supporting multiple
   sub-second sessions concurrently.

3.  Applicability of p2mp BFD

   [RFC8562] may provide an efficient and scalable solution for the
   fast-converging environment that demonstrates the head-tails
   relationship.  Each such group presents itself as p2mp BFD session
   with its head being the root and other routers being tails of the
   p2mp BFD session.  Figure 1 displays the new optional BFD
   Discriminator PIM Hello Option to bootstrap tail of the p2mp BFD
   session.

               Figure 1: BFD Discriminator PIM Hello Option

   where new fields are interpreted as:

      OptionType is a value (TBA1) assigned by IANA Section 4 that
      identifies the TLV as BFD Discriminator TLV;

      OptionLength value is always 4

      My Discriminator - My Discriminator value allocated by the root of
      the p2mp BFD session.

3.1.  Using P2MP BFD in PIM DR/BDR Monitoring

   If PIM-SM routers that support this specification are configured to
   use p2mp BFD for faster convergence, then the router to be monitored,
   referred to as 'head', MUST create a BFD session of type
   MultipointHead, as defined in [RFC8562].  Note that any PIM-SM router
   that supports this specification, regardless of its role in PIM-SM,
   MAY become a head of a p2mp BFD session.  If the head doesn't support
   [I-D.ietf-pim-dr-improvement], but, for example, uses procedures
   defined in [I-D.mankamana-pim-bdr], then it MUST include BFD TLV in
   its PIM-Hello message.  If the head uses extensions defined in



Mirsky & Xiaoli           Expires June 3, 2021                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           BFD P2MP Use in PIM-SM            November 2020


   [I-D.ietf-pim-dr-improvement], then DR MUST include BFD TLV in its
   Hello message.  The DR Address TLV also MUST be included in the Hello
   message.  For a BDR, it is RECOMMENDED to include BFD TLV in its
   Hello message.  If BDR includes BFD TLV, then the BDR Address TLV
   also MUST be present in the Hello message.  As mentioned earlier, any
   non-DR and non-BDR MAY include BFD TLV in its Hello message.  Then
   the head MUST begin periodic transmission of BFD Control packets.
   The Source IP address of the BFD Control packet MUST be the same as
   the source IP address of the PIM-Hello with BFD TLV messages being
   transmitted by the head.  My Discriminator's field value in the BFD
   Control packet and My Discriminator field of the BFD TLV in PIM-
   Hello, transmitted by the head, MUST be the same.  When a PIM-SM
   router is configured to monitor the head by using p2mp BFD, referred
   to through this document as 'tail', receives PIM-Hello packet with
   BFD TLV, the tail MAY create a p2mp BFD session of type
   MultipointTail, as defined in [RFC8562].

   Because p2mp BFD doesn't use the three-way handshake and the head
   transmits BFD Control packets with the value of Your Discriminator
   field set to zero, [RFC8562] modified how a BFD system demultiplexes
   received BFD Control packet.  The tail demultiplexes p2mp BFD test
   session based on head's source IP address, the My Discriminator value
   it learned from BFD Discriminator TLV and the identity of the
   multipoint path that the BFD Control packet was received from.  The
   Detection Time for p2mp BFD sessions is defined differently from the
   definition provided in [RFC5880].  The Detection Time for each
   MultipointTail session is calculated as the product of the last
   received values of Desired Min TX Interval and Detect Mult.  A tail
   declares the BFD session down after the Detection Timer expires.  If
   the tail has detected MultipointHead failure, it MUST remove the
   neighbor.  If the failed head node was PIM-SM DR or BDR, the tail MAY
   start DR Election process as specified in Section 4.3.2 [RFC7761] or
   Section 4.1 [I-D.ietf-pim-dr-improvement] respectively.

   If the head ceased to include BFD TLV in its PIM-Hello message, tails
   MUST close the corresponding MultipointTail BFD session.  Thus the
   tail stops using BFD to monitor the head and reverts to the
   procedures defined in [RFC7761] and [I-D.ietf-pim-dr-improvement].

3.2.  P2MP BFD in PIM DR Load Balancing

   [RFC8775] defined the modification, Designated Router Load Balancing
   (DRLB), to the PIM-SM protocol that allows for distribution of PIM-SM
   DR responsibilities on a multi-access network segment.  [RFC8775]
   introduced the new PIM Hello options - Load Balancing Capability
   (DRLB-Cap) and DR Load Balancing List (DRLB-List).  PIM router that
   includes DRLB-Cap Hello Option MAY include BFD Discriminator PIM
   Hello Option (Figure 1).  That router MUST create a BFD session and

Internet-Draft           BFD P2MP Use in PIM-SM            November 2020


   set itself as MultipointHead [RFC8562].  The router MUST set
   bfd.SessionState in the MultipointHead session to Down.  If a PIM
   router that includes BFD Discriminator Option in its Hello finds its
   address in DRLB-List PIM Hello Option as Group Designated Router
   (GDR) Candidate for the first time, the router MUST set
   bfd.SessionState to Up and start periodically transmit BFD Control
   messages.  If the PIM router that was GDR Candidate doesn't find its
   address in the most recent DRLB-List Option, the router MUST set
   bfd.SessionState to Down and cease transmitting BFD Control messages.
   For each GDR Candidate that includes BFD Discriminator Option in its
   PIM Hello, PIM DR creates a MultipointTail session [RFC8562].  PIM DR
   demultiplexes BFD sessions based on the value in My Discriminator
   field and the source IP address.  If PIM DR detects a failure of one
   of the sessions, it MUST remove that router from the GDR Candidate
   list and immediately transmit a new DRLB-List Option.

3.3.  Multipoint BFD Encapsulation

   The MultipointHead of p2mp BFD session when transmitting BFD Control
   packet:

      MUST set TTL value to 1;

      SHOULD use group address ALL-PIM-ROUTERS ('224.0.0.13' for IPv4
      and 'ff02::d' for IPv6) as destination IP address

      MAY use network broadcast address for IPv4 or link-local all nodes
      multicast group for IPv6 as the destination IP address;

      MUST set destination UDP port value to 3784 when transmitting BFD
      Control packets, as defined in [RFC8562].

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new OptionType value from PIM Hello
   Options registry according to:

   +-------------+----------------+-------------------+---------------+
   | Value Name  | Length Number  | Name Protocol     | Reference     |
   +-------------+----------------+-------------------+---------------+
   | TBA         | 4              | BFD Discriminator | This document |
   +-------------+----------------+-------------------+---------------+

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [RFC7761], [RFC5880], and
   [RFC8562], and [I-D.ietf-pim-dr-improvement] apply to this document.

   PIM-SM link-local messages can be authenticated using various
   mechanisms, as described in Section 6.3 [RFC7761].  Authentication of
   BFD Control messages defined in Section 6.7 [RFC5880].  Each protocol
   MAY use authentication of its messages independently of the mode used
   by the other protocol.

   An implementation that supports this specification SHOULD use a
   mechanism to control the maximum number of BFD sessions that can be
   active at the same time.
