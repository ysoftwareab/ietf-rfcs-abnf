INTERNET DRAFT      MPTCP Enhancement Opportunities          Oct 17,2015


Abstract

   MPTCP Intends to address a wide range of issues, with minimal
   implementation tweaks. Though this works in a range of use
   cases,there are some use cases, where some standard implementation
   recommendations could help. The Purpose of this draft is to document
   Opportunities, where Enhancements to MPTCP can translate to more
   wider deployments.

INTERNET DRAFT      MPTCP Enhancement Opportunities          Oct 17,2015


1  Introduction

   The Scope of the use cases discussed is limited to impact on end-user
   experience only and recommended updates at SP (PE Router). The
   initial versions of this draft would document findings from tests
   covering various end-user use cases in detail, that presents mptcp
   enhancement opportunities. The later versions of the document would
   strive to provide solutions for the documented usecase scenarios.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2 MPTCP Enhancement Opportunities - End user Use cases

2.1 Short Flows vs Long Flows

   Internet traffic MUST have Security, Throughput, Reliability,.. taken
   care across different network conditions, modes of access and flows.
   Data access can be categorized into short or long flows.

   Too many Small Flows => Higher Number of Transactions. But, much less
   Bandwidth Consumption

      Can we achieve Low latency for short flows?

      Average completion of flow with mptcp can be higher than
      completion time without mptcp With Bunch of Short Flows, MPTCP may
      negatively impact throughput

      Even a single lost packet can force an entire connection to wait
      for an RTO.

   Far Lesser Long Flows => Lesser Number of Transactions. But, higher
   Bandwidth Consumption

      Can we achieve higher Throughput for Long Flows Without
      compromising on performance?

      How do we maintain Reliability? How do we manage tolerance to
      sudden and high bursts of traffic?

   In Summary, Both long and short flows are important from the enduser
   perspective. We need to come up with appropriate definition and clear
   demarcation for short and long flows, from MPTCP Perspective. These
   need be dealt differently (Probably with multiple profiles).

2.2 Application based Path selection and Adaptive buffering

   How much of benefit it would be when we consider different type of
   applications, for better mptcp profiling. Typical internet
   applications are categorized as Elastic and InElastic.

   Elastic vs Inelastic Applications..How does it matter to MPTCP?

      MPTCP performance is impacted :

        When the size of the receive buffer is limited.

        Path with high RTT may result in the receive buffer size
        growing beyond the allowed maximum

        Diversified RTT

      Different ways of handling packets => Better Performance.

   In Summary, Application based Path Selection and Adaptive Buffering
   can help with the above scenarios. Tweaking the buffer sizes based on
   the type of application and/or network condition can positively
   impact the flows.

2.3 Path Selection Enhancements

   Path Selection is one of the important part of MPTCP. Though there
   are existing tools that help diagnose issues in the path, there still
   is scope to fine tune it further flexible based on certain factors.

   Usecases where MPTCP path selection can be enhanced:

      For High packet loss and High latency networks?

      Multiple profiles to dynamically switch (move across) the
      networks?

      Roaming scenarios

   In Summary, The best optimal path is ever changing in the Internet.
   Frequent switching may cause unnecessary overheads and can impact
   performance. Enhanced yet controlled Path Selection and Path
   Switching can help get better performance out of the network.

2.4 Optimal number of paths

   The best and effective path selection is critical to the effect of
   MPTCP for the client application. How about the optimal number of
   sub-flows? Can we improve client experience by controlling number of
   sub flows based on certain factors? 

   Controlling the number of sub flows getting created:

   How many is too many? 

   Can this be controlled? What Inputs to Consider?

        Based on Network Characteristics

        Historic data (region wise)


   In Summary, MPTCP being not too strict as well as not too flexible,
   Certain profiling based on detailed analysis of data can positively
   impact MPTCP experience

3 UseCase Scenarios (Simulated in Lab) and Results

   Data for enhancement opportunities are derived from our lab tests.
   These tests are done in a reasonably populated, yet contained test
   network. The initial set of tests are more focused on the throughput
   side and covers simulated Near, Mid and Far cell network conditions.
   The Intention is to get detailed data from set of tests to cover
   different types of data access (short/long or elastic/inelastic
   applications, mobile network conditions,..etc) as well as different
   mptcp profiles (for eg. number of sub flows). The detailed analysis
   and summary would be presented in the later sections of the document,
   followed by design/implementation recommendations for the SPs.
