Abstract

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a widely 
   deployed framework for host registration and configuration [DHC]. 
   DHCP, however, was designed only for fixed hosts on physically secure
   LANs. Other protocols fill some of the gap. PPP [PPP] is a good 
   solution for many commercial service providers (where framing is 
   needed). Mobile IP [MIP] is ideal for registering and configuring
   roaming users (when transparent address binding is needed). This 
   still leaves many environments where there is no ideal solution,
   such as: roaming users who do not need transparent address binding

Internet Draft       Requirements for Extending DHCP       March 3, 2000


   (e.g., a mobile web browser), and commercial service providers 
   who want to support home networking with multiple nodes. This draft
   proposes DHCP as the best protocol to meet these new needs, because 
   it leave open how (and whether) to provide other functions, such as 
   framing (e.g., PPP), locating (e.g., Mobile IP in co-located mode), 
   inter-domain AAA (e.g., [AAAR]), or address distribution (e.g., 
   [DAAP]). We describe and solicit feedback on seven new requirements 
   that would be placed on DHCP to meet these needs.  



1. Introduction

   Most future networks will use IP technology. To provide heterogeneity
   and flexibility, devices will likely access this IP-based network by
   directly sending IP packets. In such an environment it is natural to
   consider using IP-based protocols for user-network signaling, since 
   they can be used across any wired or wireless access network.


1.1 Architecture

   Figure 1 shows a high level functional architecture of a future IP-
   based network, with both a fixed and a roaming clients attaching
   to various wired or wireless Access Networks.  We assume the client 
   has at least one physical interface onto the access network, but 
   can also have other physical and virtual interfaces. The access 
   network, which may contain multiple Layer 2 nodes (such as hubs), 
   connects to at least one Edge Router and Edge Agent (that may be
   co-located). The Regional Backbone connects all the Edge Routers in
   an administrative domain and the Global Internet interconnects all  
   the regional networks.

   We assume the network may need to change client configuration of even
   fixed nodes at any time, but that typically clients keep the same 
   configuration (e.g., IP address) while they are within a given access
   network. Micro mobility within the access network is handled at Layer
   2. Depending on how routing is done, the client may or may not need a
   new configuration when it moves to a new access network within the 
   same domain (macro mobility) [CEL] [HAW]. We assume, however, that 
   clients must be reconfigured when moving to a new domain (global 
   mobility).

   Figure 1 is meant to be very general functional diagram. It does not,
   for example, specify where a Base Station (BS) is located. BSs could
   be within the access networks (Layer 2 BS) or in the Edge Router (IP 
   BS). The Domain and Inter-Domain agents which perform functions such 
   as registration and AAA, are shown as single boxes; but both could be
   implemented as multiple nodes (possibly in a hierarchical structure).


1.2 Functional Scope

   The functions needed to support users' accessing IP-based networks 
   vary, depending on network, user, and application characteristics.  
   Some basic functions include:
    o Registration: Users indicate their presence and their requirements
      to a network (e.g., give a user name [NAI]). 
    o Configuration: Networks adapt nodes to the particular network 
      characteristics (e.g., give an IP address).
    o Framing: Indicates the start and end of packets in a data stream.
    o Compression: Compress RTP/UDP/TCP/IP header and data over an  
      access network.
    o Dynamic Address Binding: Allows corresponding nodes to locate 
      users and allows continuous communication as the user moves among
      networks.

   This draft is concerned only with the first two functions, which we
   believe have a natural association (see Section 3.5). This draft 
   considers only server based methods for registration and 
   configuration within a single IP domain. The network servers are 
   themselves configured with information such as an IP address pool; 
   but, server configuration is beyond the scope of this draft. We 
   assume each access network has at least one edge server (possibly 
   co-located with the edge router), though it could be as simple as a 
   relay agent.


1.3 Requirements Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [REQ].

2 Registration and Configuration Protocols

   There are several TCP/IP protocol choices for performing registration
   and configuration:
    o The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).
    o The Mobile IP protocol (MIP). 
    o The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).


2.1 PPP

   Although its primary function is packet framing, PPP also provides
   well tested and widely deployed registration and configuration 
   capabilities. PPP [PPP] clients sends registration information, such
   as login and password to an access concentrator on the Layer 2 
   network to which the client is connected. The access concentrator can
   then either directly configure the client or use the Layer 2
   Tunneling Protocol [PPPL] to tunnel PPP packets to and from a server
   anywhere in the Internet. The powerful PPP registration and 
   configuration capabilities are now even used when framing is not 
   needed (e.g., PPPoE [PPPE]). The only cost is that it leaves some of
   the PPP framing overhead (2 bytes for framing, 2 bytes for CRC, up to
   4 other bytes, and bit or byte stuffing overhead). 


2.2 Mobile IP

   Although its primary function is providing location service and 
   continuous connectivity to roaming users, Mobile IP [MIP] [MIP6] also
   provides a flexible registration and configuration capabilities. The
   Mobile IP client sends registration information to a Foreign Agent 
   [MIPA] [MIPC] [MIPD] [MIPN] [MIPS] [MIPT] on the Layer 2 network to 
   which the client is connected. The Foreign Agent can then configure 
   the client, after getting authorization from the user's Home Agent. 
   The registration and configuration capabilities could be provided by
   Mobile IP for all roaming users, even when transparent binding is not
   needed (e.g., for web browsing) or may need alternative mechanisms 
   (viz., SIP for real-time applications [SIP] [SIPM]). The only costs 
   are: a) triangular routing, b) having to configure a permanent home 
   address, and c) depending on a home network.

Internet Draft       Requirements for Extending DHCP       March 3, 2000



2.3 DHCP

   DHCP provides a well tested and widely deployed framework for passing
   configuration information to hosts [DHC]. A DHCP client in a host
   broadcasts a DISCOVER control message to the access network. A
   server picks up the message and either a) returns an OFFER message
   (server) or b) relays the message to a central DHCP server. DHCP is 
   unique in that it:
    o Has no additional functions (e.g., framing or address binding).
    o Requires no client preconfiguration (e.g., for home addresses).
    o No overhead to data traffic (out-of-band signaling).
    o Allows nodes to go on and off without re-registration. 
    o Allows a single network server per domain (using relay agents).

   DHCP is likely to continue to gain in popularity with recent 
   enhancements, such as Server fail-over [DHCF], Load balancing [DHCB],
   Dynamic updating of DNS [DHCD], LDAP database management [DHCL], and 
   Authentication [DHCA]. 


2.4 Choice

   PPP, Mobile IP and DHCP were designed for different environments.
   Thus, network designers select the registration and configuration 
   protocol that best fits the types of access network and likely client
   applications. For example, networks using phone lines for access will
   typically use PPP; wireless providers supporting roaming TCP 
   application, such as telnet and ftp, will use Mobile IP; and 
   corporate networks will use DHCP. 

   The open question is what registration and configuration protocol 
   will be used in environments that do not fit into the PPP, Mobile IP,
   or DHCP assumptions? Examples of these environments are:
    o Commercial service providers who want to support flexible home 
      networking.
    o Roaming users who either do not need transparent binding (e.g., 
      just web browsing) or prefer alternative mechanisms (e.g., SIP for
      real-time applications).
   PPP, Mobile IP and DHCP could all be adapted to better some or all of
   these environments. This draft proposes DHCP as the best protocol to
   meet these new needs, because it leave open how (and whether) to 
   provide other functions, such as framing (e.g., PPP), locating (e.g.,
   Mobile IP in co-located mode), inter-domain AAA (e.g., [AAAR]), or 
   address distribution (e.g., [DAAP]). We describe the new requirements 
   that would be placed on DHCP in the next Section.

3. Requirements for Extending DHCP into New Environments
     
   Though DHCP has many desirable features, the following requirements 
   created by new environments are not fully met by DHCP:
     o R1 Rapid client configuration (milliseconds rather than seconds).
     o R2 Rapid client reconfiguration (independent of lease time).
     o R3 Efficient use of scarce wireless bandwidth.  
     o R4 Allowing clients to be routers.
     o R5 Enhanced registration (e.g, user identification and security).
     o R6 Flexible proxies that can act as both relay or server. 
     o R7 Allowing dynamic server and relay reconfiguration.
   This section gives a brief description and motivation for each new 
   requirement.


3.1 Rapid configuration

   Configuration latency is critical to users roaming among wireless 
   networks. A DHCP client accepts an OFFER by returning a REQUEST 
   message to the server (which the server ACKS). The client, however,
   only configures its new address after checking that no other node on
   the subnet is using it. The DHCP specification [DHC] says a client 
   SHOULD do ARP checking before an assigned address is used. This 
   "in-line" checking results in long delay (typically 3-15 seconds) 
   before communication can resume after a move; too long for many
   roaming users. While duplicate detection is desirable, it need not be
   part of the critical path. One possible alternative, for example, 
   would be to have the server do ARP checking on addresses before they 
   are requested. 

   The goal is to get configuration in milliseconds (bounded mostly by
   by the speed of the access link) rather than seconds.

Internet Draft       Requirements for Extending DHCP       March 3, 2000



3.2 Rapid reconfiguration

   A recent draft [DHCR] has proposed a new DHCP FORCERENEW message 
   that allows servers to force clients to immediately reconfigure.
   To enable rapid reconfiguration (e.g., when a roaming user moves into
   a new subnet or topology changes), clients must rapidly detect the 
   server request. Today, DHCP clients typically go into sleep mode, 
   not listening to DHCP messages until the lease is due for renewal. 
   Clients can use external triggers, such as a layer 2 hand-off 
   indication or an SNMP V3 request message, to jump DHCP into a new 
   state. These triggers, however, may not always: a) be available,  
   b) be standardized, c) have enough information. The information may 
   help client to decide if it is in a new subnet or to get the location
   of a DHCP server (to prevent having to broadcast). 

   The goal is to be able to rapidly reconfigure DHCP clients, at any 
   time, without relying on external triggers.


3.3 Bandwidth Efficiency
 
   DHCP message overhead is considerably larger than needed, mainly 
   because DHCP kept the same syntax as BOOTP [BOO1] [BOO2] [BOOD]. This
   was not a problem in the old paradigm where hosts connect to DHCP 
   servers over high speed LANs; especially since DHCP overhead mainly 
   occurs when a host first boots and DHCP adds nothing to normal packet
   communication overhead. The overhead is perhaps only a problem for 
   roaming nodes using some wireless access networks. Depending on the 
   size of the IP subnets, roaming users might need to reconfigure as 
   fast as every few seconds. Depending on the speed and error rate of 
   the wireless access networks, reducing DHCP message size could 
   significantly improve bandwidth efficiency. (The error rate can be 
   important since larger messages result in higher probability of loss,
   that increases latency and bandwidth needs.)

   The goal is to minimize DHCP message size, by reducing the size of
   individual DHCP messages and possibly by reducing the total number of
   messages.

Internet Draft       Requirements for Extending DHCP       March 3, 2000



3.4 Clients as Routers

   DHCP specification [DHC] says clients must be hosts and that it "is 
   not intended for use in configuring routers." This was not a problem 
   in the old paradigm, where routers were typically part of a 
   hierarchical network that could be manually configured by a system's
   administrator. As the size and complexity of networks increase
   (e.g., with more small devices with low power wireless interfaces), 
   routing functionality becomes desirable in places where manual
   configuration is not desirable. We are NOT proposing that DHCP be
   extended to simultaneously configure multiple router interfaces or
   to distribute address pools; only that DHCP could configure a single
   router interface over a subnet where there is a DHCP server (or
   relay). This would require no change in DHCP functionality; only a 
   change in allowable application.

   The goal is to allow DHCP to configure hosts and routers. 


3.5 Enhanced Registration

   Commercial service providers need a scalable way to identify and 
   authenticate users. In addition they may need other registration 
   information such as: a) the location of the client's AAA server 
   (for inter-domain authentication [DHCZ], b) negotiate service 
   requirements and costs, and c) trigger other services (possibly
   based on a user profile). Many of these features are now being
   defined for DHCP, but filling the missing needs would be helpful. 
   We assume that DHCP itself only deals with intra-domain registration;
   a separate AAA protocol [AAAD] [AAAR] meets the inter-domain 
   requirements.

   The registration and configuration could be done in separate 
   protocols; however we believe integrating the two functions is
   desirable. First, it reduces the latency, since it requires only
   one round trip from the client to the network. Second, it forces
   users to register before they can be configured. Clearly, devious
   users could still configure themselves, but now they cannot use 
   DHCP to do this.

   The goal is to allow DHCP to meet the registration needs of diverse
   service providers.

3.6 DHCP Proxies

   A DHCP client must either connect to a node acting as a DHCP server 
   or connect to a DHCP relay. When a client first activates or moves 
   into a new domain, DHCP message are best relayed to a central server
   (such as the Domain Agent in Figure 1); however, when users roaming 
   among subnets within a domain DHCP message may best be handled 
   locally. This would require no change in DHCP functionality; only a 
   change in allowable application.

   The goal is to allow a subnet proxy to act as both a relay and  
   server, depending on a client's status.


3.7 Dynamically changing server (and relay) parameters

   In some networks it may be desirable to dynamically change the
   preconfigured information in DHCP servers (and relay agents). For
   example, the address-pool may change if a topology change occurs 
   [DAAP]. While DHCP should have nothing to do with updating
   address-pools, it should be able to handle dynamic changes in this 
   information. If an external application changed the information, 
   DHCP should gracefully handle the change (e.g., it may immediately 
   update all its clients). This would require no change in DHCP 
   protocol, only that: a) there is a common configuration framework
   (e.g., [DHCL]), and b) that DHCP servers and relay agents allow 
   dynamic changes in preconfigured information.

   The goal is to allow dynamic modification of DHCP server (and relay)
   configured parameters, such as the address-pool, by an external
   entity.

4 Discussion

   The purpose of this draft is to stimulate discussion and solicit
   feedback on enhancing DHCP into new environments. These environments
   include roaming users who do not need transparent address binding
   (e.g., a mobile web browser) or commercial service providers whose 
   access network provides framing (e.g., a cable access network). 
   Given the large paradigm shift created by these new environments, it
   is an open question on how to achieve these changes. At the highest 
   level we could slowly enhance DHCP, while maintaining backwards 
   compatibility. A more radical approach would be the creation of a 
   sister protocol such as DRCP [DRCP]. We have not given specific 
   approaches or mechanisms here, except as examples, because we 
   initially want to focus on the requirements.
