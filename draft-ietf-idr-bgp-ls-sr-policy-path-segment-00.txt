1.  Introduction

   Segment routing (SR) [RFC8402] is a source routing paradigm that
   allows the ingress node steers packets into a specific path according
   to the Segment Routing Policy
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   However, the SR Policies defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] only supports unidirectional
   SR paths and there is no path ID in a Segment List to identify an SR
   path.  For identifying an SR path and supporting bidirectional path
   [I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment], new policies carrying Path

Internet-Draft  Path ID and Bi-directional Path in BGP-LS  November 2019


   Segment and bidirectional path information are defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution], as well as the
   extensions to BGP to distribute new SR policies.  The Path Segment
   can be a Path Segment in SR-MPLS [I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment]
   , or other IDs that can identify a path.

   In many network scenarios, the configuration and state of each TE
   Policy is required by a controller which allows the network operator
   to optimize several functions and operations through the use of a
   controller aware of both topology and state information
   [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution].

   To collect the TE Policy information that is locally available in a
   router, [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution] describes a new mechanism
   by using BGP-LS update messages.

   Based on the mechanism defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution],
   this document describes a mechanism to distribute configuration and
   states of the new SR policies defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution] to external
   components using BGP-LS.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8402] and
   [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution].

3.  Carrying SR Path Sub-TLVs in BGP-LS

   A mechanism to collect states of SR Policies via BGP-LS is proposed
   by [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution].  The characteristics of an SR
   policy can be described by a TE Policy State TLV, which is carried in
   the optional non-transitive BGP Attribute "LINK_STATE Attribute"
   defined in [RFC7752].  The TE Policy State TLV contains several sub-
   TLVs such as SR TE Policy sub-TLVs.  Rather than replicating SR TE
   Policy sub-TLVs, [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution] reuses the
   equivalent sub-TLVs as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].

   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution] defines the BGP
   extensions for Path Segment.  The Path Segment can appear at both
   segment-list level and candidate path level upon the use case.  The
   encoding is shown below.

             Figure 2. SR policy for Bidirectional path

   In order to collect configuration and states of unidirectional and
   bidirectional SR policies defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution], new sub-TLVs in SR
   TE Policy sub-TLVs should be defined.  Likewise, rather than
   replicating SR Policy sub-TLVs, this document can reuse the
   equivalent sub-TLVs as defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution].

3.1.  SR Path Segment Sub-TLV

   This section reuses the SR Path Segment sub-TLV defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution] to describe a Path
   Segment , and it can be included in the Segment List sub-TLV as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution] . An SR Path Segment
   sub-TLV can be associated with an SR path specified by a Segment List
   sub-TLV, and it MUST appear only once within a Segment List sub-TLV.
   Also, it can be used for identifying an SR candidate path or an SR
   Policy defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   The format of Path Segment TLV is included below for reference.

   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution].

3.2.  Sub-TLVs for Bidirectional Path

   In some scenarios like mobile backhaul transport network, there are
   requirements to support bidirectional path.  In SR, a bidirectional
   path can be represented as a binding of two unidirectional SR paths
   [I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment].
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution] defines new sub-TLVs
   to describe an SR bidirectional path.  An SR policy carrying SR
   bidirectional path information is expressed in Figure 1.

3.2.1.  SR Bidirectional Path Sub-TLV

   This section reuses the SR bidirectional path sub-TLV defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution] to specify a
   bidirectional path, which contains a Segment List sub-TLV
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] and an associated Reverse
   Path Segment List as defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution].  The SR
   bidirectional path sub-TLV has the following format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

3.2.2.  SR Reverse Path Segment List Sub-TLV

   This section reuses the SR Reverse Path Segment List sub-TLV defined
   in [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution] to specify an
   reverse SR path associated with the path specified by the Segment
   List in the same SR Bidirectional Path Sub-TLV, and it has the
   following format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

4.  Operations

   No new operation procedures are defined in this document, the
   operations procedures of [RFC7752] can apply to this document.

   Typically but not limited to, the uni/bidirectional SR policies
   carrying path identification information can be distributed by the
   ingress node.

   Generally, BGP-LS is used for collecting link states and
   synchronizing with the external component.  The consumer of the uni/
   bidirectional SR policies carrying path identification information is
   not BGP LS process by itself, and it can be any applications such as
   performance measurement [I-D.gandhi-spring-udp-pm] and path re-
   coputation or re-optimization, etc.  The operation of sending
   information to other precesses is out of scope of this document.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  BGP-LS TLVs

   IANA maintains a registry called "Border Gateway Protocol - Link
   State (BGP-LS) Parameters" with a sub-registry called "Node Anchor,
   Link Descriptor and Link Attribute TLVs".  The following TLV
   codepoints are suggested (for early allocation by IANA):
