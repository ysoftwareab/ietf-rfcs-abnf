  Abstract


This memo describes an SMTP extension to differentiate between
ordinary and unsolicited (bulk) e-mail.  This can in turn be used
as a mailbox-by-mailbox opt-in or opt-out mechanism for allowing
or disallowing bulk e-mail.


  Introduction

A new SMTP verb, BULK, is defined.  It is to be used instead of MAIL
when sending bulk e-mail.  This gives the receiving MTA the ability
to accept or reject the message on a per recipient basis, according
to the individual preference of the recipient.


  Examples

S: <wait for open connection>
C: <open connection to server>
S: 220 example.com SMTP service ready
C: EHLO spam.com
S: 250-example.com
S: 250 BULK
C: BULK FROM:<Friend@public.com>
S: 250 sender <Friend@public.com> OK
C: RCPT TO:<user1@example.com>
S: 550 no.
C: RCPT TO:<user2@example.com>
S: 550 no.
C: RCPT TO:<user3@example.com>
S: 550 no.
 ...
C: RCPT TO:<user999@example.com>
S: 550 no.
C: QUIT
S: 221 goodbye


  Security Considerations

This proposal is not believed to affect the security (or lack thereof)
of SMTP in any way.


  IANA Considerations

There are no IANA considerations in the current draft.
