Internet-Draft                 SIEVE-XMPP                      July 2006


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   The [NOTIFY] extension to the [SIEVE] mail filtering language is a
   framework for providing notifications by employing URIs to specify
   the notification mechanism.  This document defines how xmpp URIs (see
   [XMPP-URI]) are used to generate notifications via the Extensible
   Messaging and Presence Protocol (see [XMPP]), which is widely
   implemented in Jabber technologies.

1.2.  Terminology

   This document inherits terminology from [NOTIFY], [SIEVE], and
   [XMPP].

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [TERMS].


2.  Definition

   The xmpp mechanism results in the sending of an XMPP message to
   notify a recipient about an email message.  The general XMPP syntax
   is as follows:

   o  The notification MUST be an XMPP <message/> stanza.
   o  The value of the XMPP 'type' attribute MUST be 'headline' or
      'normal'.
   o  The value of the XMPP 'from' attribute MUST be the XMPP address of
      the notification service.
   o  The XMPP <message/> stanza MAY include a <subject/> child element
      whose value is some configurable text indicating that the message
      is a Sieve notification.
   o  The notification SHOULD include a URL for the recipient to use as
      a hint in locating the message, encapsulated as the XML character
      data of a <url/> child element of an <x/> element qualified by the
      'jabber:x:oob' namespace as specified in [JEP-0066].

   The recommended mapping of the Sieve notify action into XMPP syntax
   is described in the following sections.

2.1.  Notify tag ":method"

   The ":method" tag MUST be a URI that conforms to the xmpp URI scheme
   (as specified in [XMPP-URI]) and that identifies an XMPP account



Saint-Andre & Melnikov  Expires January 22, 2007                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 SIEVE-XMPP                      July 2006


   associated with the email inbox.  The URI MAY include the resource
   identifier portion of an XMPP address but SHOULD NOT include an
   authority component, query component, or fragment identifier
   component.  The processing application MUST extract an XMPP address
   from the URI in accordance with the processing rules specified in
   [XMPP-URI].  The resulting XMPP address MUST be encapsulated in XMPP
   syntax as the value of the XMPP 'to' attribute.

2.2.  Notify tag ":from"

   The ":from" tag has no special meaning for this notification
   mechanism, and this specification puts no restriction on its use.  As
   noted, the value of the XMPP 'from' attribute specified in the XMPP
   notification message MUST be the XMPP address of the notification
   service itself.  The value of the ":from" tag MAY be transformed into
   XMPP syntax; if so, it SHOULD be encapsulated as the value of an
   [JEP-0131] header named "Reply-To".

2.3.  Notify tag ":options"

   The ":options" tag has no special meaning for this notification
   mechanism.  Any handling of this tag is the responsibility of an
   implementation.

2.4.  Notify tag ":priority"

   The ":priority" tag has no special meaning for this notification
   mechanism, and this specification puts no restriction on its use.
   The value of the ":priority" tag MAY be transformed into XMPP syntax;
   if so, it MUST be encapsulated as the value of an [JEP-0131] header
   named "Urgency", and the XML character of that header MUST be "high"
   if the value of the ":priority" tag is "1", "medium" if the value of
   the ":priority" tag is "2", or "low" if the value of the ":priority"
   tag is "3".

2.5.  Notify tag ":message"

   If included, the ":message" tag SHOULD be transformed into the XML
   character data of an XMPP <body/> element.  If not included, the rule
   specified in [NOTIFY] SHOULD be followed, as shown in the examples
   below.


3.  Examples

   In the following examples, the sender of the email has an address of
   <mailto:juliet@example.org>, the entity to be notified has an XMPP
   address of <xmpp:romeo@example.com>, and the notification service has



Saint-Andre & Melnikov  Expires January 22, 2007                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 SIEVE-XMPP                      July 2006


   an XMPP address <xmpp:notify.example.com>.

   The following is a basic Sieve notify action with only a method:

   notify :method "xmpp:romeo@example.com"

   The resulting XMPP <message/> stanza might be as follows:

   <message from='notify.example.com'
            to='romeo@example.com'
            xml:lang='en'>
     <subject>A Sieve instant notification!</subject>
     <body>&lt;juliet@example.org&gt; Wherefore art thou?</body>
   </message>

   The following is a more advanced Sieve notify action with a method,
   priority, and message, as well as a URL pointing to the message:

   notify :method "xmpp:romeo@example.com"
          :priority "1"
          :message "Contact Juliet immediately!"

   The resulting XMPP <message/> stanza might be as follows:

   <message from='notify.example.com'
            to='romeo@example.com'
            xml:lang='en'>
     <subject>A Sieve instant notification!</subject>
     <body>Contact Juliet immediately!</body>
     <headers xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/shim'>
       <header name='Urgency'>high</header>
     </headers>
     <x xmlns='jabber:x:oob'>
       <url>
         imap://romeo@example.com/INBOX;UIDVALIDITY=385759045/;UID=20
       </url>
     </x>
   </message>


4.  Internationalization Considerations

   Although an XMPP address may contain nearly any [UNICODE] character,
   the value of the ":method" tag MUST be a Uniform Resource Identifier
   (see [URI]) rather than an Internationalized Resource Identifier (see
   [IRI]).  The rules specified in [XMPP-URI] MUST be followed when
   generating XMPP URIs.

Internet-Draft                 SIEVE-XMPP                      July 2006


   In accordance with Section 13 of RFC 3920, all data sent over XMPP
   MUST be encoded in [UTF-8].


5.  Security Considerations

   Depending on the information included, sending a notification can be
   comparable to forwarding mail to the notification recipient.  Care
   must be taken when forwarding mail automatically, to ensure that
   confidential information is not sent into an insecure environment.
   In particular, implementations MUST conform to the security
   considerations given in [NOTIFY], [SIEVE], and [XMPP].
