m = 1:
      Step 0:
        PATHS: <4, W>
        TENT: <3, 2, 3>, <5, 2, 1>, <8, 1, 2>
      Step 2:
        Routers are preferred to hosts:
        Router 3 and 5 have the same distance.  The sum of the IPv6
        addresses of node 3 and 4 is 7 and therefore lower than the sum
        of the IPv6 addresses of node 5 and 4 which is 9.  So node 3 is
        selected to be placed on PATHS.
        PATHS: <4, W> <3, 3>
        TENT: <5, 2, 1> <8, 1, 2>
P = 3 is a router, so continue with Step 1
  
m = 2:
      Step 1:
        Node 3 was selected as the node P with shortest distance; 3 was
        removed from TENT and placed in PATHS.  Since node 3 is a
        router, the LSAs of node 3 have to be examined.
        PATHS: <4, W>, <3, 3>
        TENT: <1, 3, 3>, <2, 1, 3>, <5, 1, 3>, <8, 1, 2>
      Step 2:
        Routers are preferred to hosts:
        Router 2 and 5 have the same distance. The sum of the IPv6
        addresses of node 2 and 3 is 5 and therefore lower than the sum
        of the IPv6 addresses of node 3 and 5 which is 8.  So node 2 is
        selected to be placed on PATHS.
        PATHS: <4, W>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>
        TENT: <1, 3, 3>, <5, 1, 3>, <8, 1, 2>
P = 2 is a router, so continue with Step 1
  
m = 3:
      Step 1:
        Node 2 was selected as the node P with shortest distance; 2 was
        removed from TENT and placed in PATHS.  Since node 2 is a
        router, the LSAs of node 2 have to be examined.
        PATHS: <4, W>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>
        TENT: <1, 2, 3>, <5, 1, 3>, <8, 1, 2>
      Step 2:
        Routers are preferred to hosts:
        Selection of node 5 as P, as it has the shortest distance among
        all routers.
        PATHS: <4, W>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>, <5, 3>
        TENT: <1, 2, 3>, <8, 1, 2>
P = 5 is a router, so continue with Step 1.

m = 4:
      Step 1:
        Node 5 was selected as the node P with shortest distance; 5 was
        removed from TENT and placed in PATHS.  Since node 5 is a
        router, the LSAs of node 5 have to be examined.
        PATHS: <4, W>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>, <5, 3>
        TENT: <1, 2, 3>, <7, 1, 3 >, <8, 1, 2>
      Step 2:
        Routers are preferred to hosts:
        Selection of node 1 as P
        PATHS: <4, W>, <1, 3>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>, <5, 3>
        TENT: <7, 1, 3>, <8, 1, 2>
P = 1 is a router, so continue with Step 1.

m = 5:
      Step 1:
        Node 1 was selected as the node P; 1 was removed from TENT and
        placed in PATHS.  Since node 1 is a router, the LSAs of node 1
        have to be examined.
        PATHS: <4, W>, <1, 3>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>, <5, 3>
        TENT: <6, 1, 3>, <7, 1, 3>, <8, 1, 2>
      Step 2:
        Nodes 6, 7 and 8 have the same distance.  The sum of the IPv6
        addresses of node 1 and 6 is 7 and therefore lower than the sum
        of the IPv6 addresses of node 5 and 7 which is 12 or the sum of
        the IPv6 addresses of node 4 and 8, which is also 12.  So node 6
        is selected to be placed on PATHS.
        PATHS: <4, W>, <1, 3>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>, <5, 3>, <6, 3>
        TENT: <7, 1, 3>, <8, 1, 2>
P = 6 is a host, so continue with Step 2

m = 6:
      Step 2:
        Nodes 7 and 8 have the same distance.  The sum of the IPv6
        addresses of node 5 and 7 is 12, and therefore equal to the sum
        of the IPv6 addresses of node 4 and 8, which is also 12.  So
        node 8 is selected, since node 4 has the lowest IPv6 address
        (see criteria d) of tiebreaker).
        PATHS: <4, W>, <1, 3>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>, <5, 3>, <6, 3>, <8, 2>
        TENT: <7, 1, 3>
P = 8 is a host, so continue with Step 2

m = 7:
      Step 2:
        Selection of node 7 as P
        PATHS: <4, W>, <1, 3>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>, <5, 3>, <6, 3>, <7, 3>,
               <8, 2>
        TENT: Empty

m = 8:
      Step 2:
        TENT is empty, so the algorithm has finished.  All reachable
        nodes are now contained in PATHS.
