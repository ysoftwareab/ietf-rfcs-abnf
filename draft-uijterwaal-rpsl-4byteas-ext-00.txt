Abstract

   This document specifies extensions to the RPSL language for dealing
   with 32 bit (4 byte) AS numbers.


1.  Introduction

   Four byte (32 bit) AS numbers (ASN32) are defined in [as4bytes].
   This document does not specify a format to represent these numbers.

Internet-Draft    RPSL extensions for 32 bit AS Numbers      August 2006


   A separate document [asn32rep] proposes to represent them as:

   <high order 16 bit value in decimal>.<low order 16 bit value in
   decimal>

   This format allows users to easily distinguish 16 and 32 bit ASN.

   RPSL (Routing Policy Specification Language) ([RFC2622] and
   [RFC4012]) uses the format "ASx" for an AS, with x a 1 to 5 digit
   number in the range 0 to 65535.  RPSL was defined before the
   introduction of 32 bit AS Number (ASN32).

   Deployment of ASN32 will start early 2007 [asn32d].  To use these
   numbers in RPSL, the RPSL standard will have to be updated to allow
   for ASN32.


2.  Proposal

   The terms "2-byte only AS Numbers" and "4-byte AS numbers" are
   defined in [asn32rep].

   Following [asn32rep], the field <as-number> in [RFC2622] (section 2)
   will be replaced by:

   An <as-number> is a string that can be either:

   o  ASx, for 2-byte only AS numbers, or
   o  ASy.z for 4-byte AS Numbers, with x and y using the same format as
      [asn32rep].
   x, y and z are integer numbers in the range 0 to 65535.  If y equals
   0, it can be dropped.

   For example, AS3333 and AS0.3333 both refer to the AS with identifier
   3333.  An identifier of AS65536 is not valid, even though the
   identifier can be expressed in a 32 bit integer.  This AS should be
   referred to as AS1.0.

   No other changes to the RPSL standard will be made.


3.  Security Considerations

   Many systems will treat strings "xxx.yyy" as real number values and
   convert this internally to floating point numbers.  One must take
   care that this will not happen.

   Systems may use unsigned 16-bit integers for the internal

   representation of AS numbers.  It should be checked that tools
   internally use (at least) an unsigned 32-bit number for ASN.


4.  IANA Considerations

   None.  (This section may be removed on publication as an RFC.)
