Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it defines a basic set of
   managed objects for SNMP-based management of MCNS compliant Cable
   Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems.  This memo specifies a
   MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI.  The set
   of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP
   standards.  This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
   community.  This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within
   the Internet Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and
   should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at
   ipcdn@terayon.com and/or the author.

1. Introduction
1.1 The Network Management Framework
   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

   RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
   and naming objects for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212 defines a
   more concise description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with
   the SMI.

   RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for the
   Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213, defines MIB-II, an evolution
   of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new operational
   requirements.

   RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access
   to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      0    RFC 1442  which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used
           for describing and naming objects for the purpose of
           management.

      0    STD 17, RFC 1213  defines MIB-II, the core set of
           managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      0    RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other
           architectural aspects of the framework.

      0    RFC 1448  which defines the protocol used for network
           access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.0 Objects

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1,
   and 2] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a
   syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The

   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [RFC1155] purposely restricts the
   ASN.1 constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are
   explicitly made for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [BER]
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.



2.2 Format of Definitions

   Section 5 contains contains the specification of all object types
   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the
   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions
   specified in [RFC1212]

3.0 Discussion


   The data-over-cable-system telephony return interface specification
   is documented in [5]. The management requirements of this interface
   are detailed in that specification. Specific inferences to other
   controls are itemized in the following list:  The Telephony Return CM
   and telephony Return CMTS MUST support the objects in the IPCDN RFI
   MIB [3]  and Cable Device MIB [4] that are applicable to downstream
   only. In a Telephony Return CM, the management of the telephony modem
   MAY use the Modem Management Information Base (MIB) using SMIv2
   [RFC1696]. These objects generally require proprietary handling to
   address the telephony modems serial AT command interface. It is not
   reasonable to require MIB support for all third party dial modems.
   However, if a dial modem is integrated within a cable modem product,
   using a subset of the RFC1696 Modem MIB objects to control the dial
   modem is practical and reasonable.  Guidelines for dial modem
   physical capabilities are provided in [5]. Guidelines for specific
   applicability of [3], [4], and [RFC1696] for telephony return systems
   are provided in [6].

4.0 Management Requirements

4.1 Handling Of Service Provider Descriptor (SPD) Updates

   The Cable Modem service provider option process is documented in [5].
   An operator creates service provider descriptors (SPDs) that the CMTS
   will send to all CMs in its domain. The operator must signify one
   entry as factory default for initial dial-in service for a
   subscriber. An external telco-return modem may have objects within
   the selected SPD modified by changing corresponding scalar objects on
   a CM using the network management station.

   One reason for the SNMP-initiated SPD update is to allow loading of
   permanent Telephone Numbers, Login Usernames and Login Passwords
   without requiring individualized configuration files on a per CM
   basis.  For example the operator MAY:

   o    set docsTrTsSPDphoneNum1 to dial a temporary access Telephone
   Number. A factory default CM user may then be given some limited
   access by using default values for all other SPD objects.

   o    Temporary system access may be upgraded after an undefined
   operator specified authentication.  The operator may then set
   docsTrTsSPDphoneNum1, docsTrTsSPDuserName, docsTrTsSPDuserPassword
   (phone/login/password) or any other CM SPD objects to individualized
   settings.

   o    These settings remain in effect unless changed by Telephone
   Settings Options in the CMs TFTP configuration file.

   o    The operator may want to change individual Telephone Settings
   Options for CMs sharing a global TFTP configuration file.  For
   example, the DHCP Server (ip address) can be changed for all CMs
   sharing a configuration file without affecting any other active SPD
   settings by having just DHCP server parameter set in the file. All
   other MIB modified SPD parameters would remain active (excepting
   docsTrTsSPDdhcpAddress MIB object) if docsTrCmSPDpersistEnable is
   TRUE.
