           draft-jia-scenarios-flexible-address-structure-00

Abstract

   Along as the adoption of TCP/IP in increasingly emerging scenarios,
   challenges emerge as well due to the ossified address structure.  To
   still enable TCP/IP for networks that previously using exclusive
   protocols, a flexible address structure would be highly preferred for
   their particular properties.  This document describes well-recognized
   scenarios that typically require a flexible address structure, and
   states the requirements of such flexible address structure.

1.  Introduction

   As the unified protocol of the network layer, Internet Protocol (IP)
   constantly promotes the prosperity of the entire Internet.  With the
   success of TCP/IP protocol stack, IP is gradually replacing exclusive
   protocols and becomes the core protocol of the entire communication
   system.

   Along as the popularization of TCP/IP, increasingly scenarios long
   for a flexible address structure.  To fulfill the reachability, IP
   address is designed to hold the topology semantic only [RFC0791].
   While within limited domains (ref.  [RFC8799]), a multi-semantic
   address could be increasingly preferred in implementing complex
   actions and capabilities for particular scenarios.  Under such
   circumstances, a flexible address structure can unleash more
   possibilities in serving new scenarios.

   This document describes well-recognized scenarios that typically
   require a flexible address structure, and states the requirements of
   such flexible address structure.

2.  Flexibility: Potential Orientation

   Since a flexible address is expected be adaptive with different
   scenarios and routing abilities,
   potentially orientations of a flexible address structure should
   include multiple semantics.  According to the definition of IP
   structure [RFC1180], cyberspace topology location serves as the only
   semantic of IP address.  While for emerging scenarios in reality,
   several semantics are expected for reachability, e.g., contents
   [CONTENT-NET] or names [ndn].  To accommodate growing requirements of
   futuristic scenarios, address with multi-semantic embedding should
   compose the core of the flexibility.  With the dynamic semantic
   embedding, the length of the address should accordingly adaptive.

3.  Scenarios

   Although new scenarios are ever changing, they principally belong to
   a fixed scene, i.e., limited domain [RFC8799].  Limited domain, which
   first defined in [RFC8799], refers to a single physical network
   attached to or running in parallel with the Internet, or a defined
   set of users and nodes distributed over a much wider area, but drawn
   together by a single virtual network over the Internet.  Within the
   limited domains, requirements, behaviors, and semantics could be
   noticeable local and network specific.

   As the dominant status of IP in networking coverage, more networks
   attempt to adopt TCP/IP in their local networks.  Instead of building
   proprietary network, a TCP/IP stack network facilitates convenient
   reachability via global Internet and reduces operating expense for
   exclusive protocols.  According to the location that the retrofit of
   address structure taking effect, targeted scenes perfectly match the
   demarcation of limited domain, i.e., a edge network attaching to
   Internet.  Thus for networks that seeking for IP convenience but
   enhanced capabilities, limited domains are scenarios that flexible
   address structure taking effect.

3.1.  Internet of Things (IoTs)

   In many IoT scenarios, a simple, low-cost communication network is
   required, and there are limitations for network devices in
   computational power, memory, and energy availability.  In addition to
   [IEEE.802.15.4], it can be seen that networks using link layer
   technologies such as Z-Wave, BLE [BLE], DECT_ULE, MS/TP, NFC, and PLC
   require end-to-end IPv6 protocols [RFC8200] to run on constrained
   node networks.  The IP protocol allows IoT devices with multiple
   connection types to connect to each other or to other nodes on the
   Internet.  Generally, a group of IoT network devices form a
   constrained node network at the edge, and IoT terminals connect to

   these network devices for data transmission.  Devices located on the
   edge of this network and the Internet can act as gateway devices.  To
   ensure security and reliability, multiple gateways must be deployed.
   IoT devices on the network can easily select one of gateways for
   traffic to pass through.  This type of network and IoT devices in the
   network require as little computational power as possible, smaller
   memory requirements, and better energy availability to reduce the
   total cost of ownership of the network.

3.2.  Satellite Network

   In the future, the space-based Internet will provide global Internet
   connections through satellite and station on the ground
   interconnection.  The low cost of satellite launch and the reduction
   of the cost of network equipment will promote the development of
   high-density satellite networks.  With the convergence of space-based
   networks and terrestrial networks, users can experience seamless
   broadband access.  Whatever on cruise ships, flights, and cars, users
   can switch data communication services over Wi-Fi, cellular, or
   satellite networks at any time.  The network service provider will
   plan the transmission path of user traffic based on the network
   coverage, satellite orbit, route, and link load.  The advantage of
   long-distance transmission but shorter delay of space-based networks
   is fully used to provide high-quality Internet connections for users
   in areas not covered by terrestrial networks.  There is a significant
   difference between the high dynamics of satellite network and the
   statics of terrestrial network topology.  The traditional satellite
   network cannot meet the preceding requirements through the networking
   of the dedicated station on the ground.

3.3.  Dynamic Service and Resource

   In the future, the network will integrate services and resources from
   various aspects such as life, production, and learning.  Digitalized
   services and resources are divided into multiple data blocks on the
   network and multiple copies of data blocks exist, which will become
   the basic mode.  Access to services and resources through URIs has
   been discussed by many researches, such as NDN [ndn] and ICN
   [RFC7476].  In practice, the dynamic services and resource management
   and access mechanisms of integrating ID and address technologies will
   be more suited to user needs.  Providers of services and resources
   can publish online services and resources through unified identifiers
   without additional planning of identifiers and locations for data and
   their replicas.  Users can access required services and resources in
   the nearest and on-demand mode.  Further, users can make a request
   based on the type of service and resource and get a response to the
   service or a copy of the data.

3.4.  Policy-based Traffic Control

   Policy-based traffic control is constantly far from flexible.  To
   restrict traffics for specific objects, e.g., devices, users, or
   group of them, a current solution is subnet partition.
   Representative technique for subnet partition includes VLAN [RFC5517]
   and VxLAN [RFC7348].  However, such mechanism usually involve
   numerous manual configuration, and even small changes in reality
   could also result in a repartition or manual efforts.

   According to the semantic of IP address forwarding, any inconvenience
   of traffic control stems from the decoupling of address semantic and
   policy objects.  Since address content only present topology location
   in IPv6, extra out-of-band effort is needed to partition network or
   recognize traffic from target objects.

   For address with objects identifier encoded, policy-based traffic
   control could be almost automatic.  For every node forwarding
   traffic, object identity could be first extracted from both source
   and destination address once packets arrive.  Then by matching
   objects and policy-based rules, nodes on the path could trigger
   particular actions that dynamically assigned by administrators.  For
   examples, action permit, action deny, and action permit but low
   priority.  Particular, such action could also be applied from
   security restriction.

3.5.  Robust Trust and Security

   A flexible semantic could be significate in constructing a trust and
   secure communication.  For example, Cryptographically Generated
   Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] embeds a truncated public key in the last
   57-bit of IPv6 address.  Even with a truncated key, authentication
   and security is greatly enhanced within a IP network via asymmetric
   cryptography and IPsec [RFC4301].  Similarly, Host Identity Protocol
   (HIP) [RFC7401] refers such methodology and constructs a enhanced
   TCP/IP stack.

   Within a flexible address structure, any secure-related keys could be
   intactly included in address structure without any information loss.
   Under such condition, connection provided by such address could be
   considered as absolute secure only if the cryptography involved is
   secure.

4.  Requirements

   According to the capabilities for scenarios above, this section
   extracts basic requirements for a flexible address structure.  Points
   below details the basal requirements.

   *  Multi-Semantics: Since semantics are the core of network routing,
      multi-semantics compose the main capability of the flexible
      address.

   *  Variable Address Length: As for networks with constrained devices,
      short address becomes necessary for protocol adoption.  While on
      other hand, address space should be adequate enough to accommodate
      numerous devices.

   *  IPv6 Interoperability: Without global reachability, a flexible
      address would be the same as an exclusive protocol.  In other
      words, a flexible address should be valuable only it is inter-
      operable with IPv6.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations.
