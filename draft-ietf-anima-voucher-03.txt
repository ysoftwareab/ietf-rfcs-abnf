              Voucher Profile for Bootstrapping Protocols
                      draft-ietf-anima-voucher-03

Abstract

   This document defines a strategy to securely assign a pledge to an
   owner, using an artifact signed, directly or indirectly, by the
   pledge's manufacturer.  This artifact is known as a "voucher".

   The voucher artifact is a YANG-defined JSON document that has been
   signed using a PKCS#7 structure.  The voucher artifact is generated
   by the pledge's manufacture or delegate (i.e. the MASA).

   This document only defines the voucher artifact, leaving it to other
   documents to describe specialized protocols for accessing it.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a strategy to securely assign a pledge to an
   owner, using an artifact signed, directly or indirectly, by the
   pledge's manufacturer or delegate (i.e. the MASA).  This artifact is
   known as the voucher.

Internet-Draft               Voucher Profile                   June 2017


   The voucher artifact is a JSON document, conforming to a data model
   described by YANG [RFC7950], that has been signed using a PKCS#7
   structure.

   A voucher may be useful in several contexts, but the driving
   motivation herein is to support secure bootstrapping mechanisms.
   Assigning ownership is important to bootstrapping mechanisms so that
   the pledge can authenticate the network that's trying to take control
   of it.

   The lifetimes of vouchers may vary.  In some bootstrapping protocols
   the vouchers may be ephemeral, whereas in others the vouchers may be
   potentially long-lived.  In order to support the second category of
   vouchers, this document recommends using short-life vouchers with
   programatic renewal, enabling the MASA to communicate the ongoing
   validity of vouchers.

   This document only defines the voucher artifact, leaving it to other
   documents to describe specialized protocols for accessing it.  Some
   bootstrapping protocols using the voucher artifact defined in this
   draft include: [I-D.ietf-netconf-zerotouch],
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-secure-join], and
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]).

2.  Terminology

   Imprint:  The process where a device obtains the cryptographic key
      material to identify and trust future interactions with a network.
      This term is taken from Konrad Lorenz's work in biology with new
      ducklings: "during a critical period, the duckling would assume
      that anything that looks like a mother duck is in fact their
      mother."  An equivalent for a device is to obtain the fingerprint
      of the network's root certification authority certificate.  A
      device that imprints on an attacker suffers a similar fate to a
      duckling that imprints on a hungry wolf.  Securely imprinting is a
      primary focus of this document.[imprinting].  The analogy to
      Lorenz's work was first noted in [Stajano99theresurrecting].

   Domain:  The set of entities or infrastructure under common
      administrative control.  The goal of the bootstrapping protocol is
      to enable a Pledge to discover and join a Domain.

   Join Registrar (and Coordinator):  A representative of the domain
      that is configured, perhaps autonomically, to decide whether a new
      device is allowed to join the domain.  The administrator of the
      domain interfaces with a Join Registrar (and Coordinator) to
      control this process. i Typically a Join Registrar is "inside" its

      domain.  For simplicity this document often refers to this as just
      "Registrar".

   MASA:  The Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA) service
      that signs vouchers.  In some bootstrapping protocols, the MASA
      may have Internet presence and be integral to the bootstrapping
      process, whereas in other protocols the MASA may be an offline
      service that has no active role in the bootstrapping process.

   Pledge:  The prospective device attempting to find and securely join
      a domain.  When shipped it only trusts authorized representatives
      of the manufacturer.

   Registrar  See Join Registrar

   TOFU:  Trust on First Use. This is where a Pledge device makes no
      security decisions but rather simply trusts the first Domain
      entity it is contacted by.  Used similarly to [RFC7435].  This is
      also known as the "resurrecting duckling" model.

   Voucher:  A signed statement from the MASA service that indicates to
      a Pledge the cryptographic identity of the Domain it should trust.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the
   sections below are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

4.  Survey of Voucher Types

   A voucher is a cryptographically protected statement to the Pledge
   device authorizing a zero-touch "imprint" on the Join Registrar of
   the domain.  The specific information a voucher provides is
   influenced by the bootstrapping use case.

   The voucher can impart the following information to the Join
   Registrar and Pledge:

   Assertion Basis:  Indicates the method that protects the imprint
      (this is distinct from the voucher signature that protects the
      voucher itself).  This might include manufacturer asserted
      ownership verification, assured logging operations or reliance on
      Pledge endpoint behavior such as secure root of trust of
      measurement.  The Join Registrar might use this information.  Only
      some methods are normatively defined in this document.  Other
      methods are left for future work.

Internet-Draft               Voucher Profile                   June 2017


   Authentication of Join Registrar:  Indicates how the Pledge can
      authenticate the Join Registrar.  This might include an indication
      of the private PKIX trust anchor used by the Registrar, or an
      indication of a public PKIX trust anchor and additional CN-ID or
      DNS-ID information to complete authentication.  Symmetric key or
      other methods are left for future work.

   Anti-Replay Protections:  Time or nonce based information to
      constrain the voucher to time periods or bootstrap attempts.

   A number of bootstrapping scenarios can be met using differing
   combinations of this information.  All scenarios address the primary
   threat of a Man-in-The-Middle Registrar gaining control over the
   Pledge device.  The following combinations are "types" of vouchers:

                |Assertion   |Registrar ID    | Validity    |
   Voucher      |Log-|Veri-  |Trust  |CN-ID or| RTC | Nonce |
   Name         | ged|  fied |Anchor |DNS-ID  |     |       |
   ---------------------------------------------------------|
   Audit        |  X |       | X     |        |     | X     |
   -------------|----|-------|-------|--------|-----|-------|
   Nonceless    |  X |       | X     |        | X   |       |
   Audit        |    |       |       |        |     |       |
   -------------|----|-------|-------|--------|-----|-------|
   Owner Audit  |  X |   X   | X     |        | X   | X     |
   -------------|----|-------|-------|--------|-----|-------|
   Owner ID     |    |   X   | X     |  X     | X   |       |
   -------------|----|-------|----------------|-----|-------|
   Bearer       |  X |       |   wildcard     | optional    |
   out-of-scope |    |       |                |             |
   -------------|----|-------|----------------|-------------|

   NOTE: All voucher types include a 'Pledge ID serial number'
         (Not shown for space reasons)

   Audit Voucher:  An Audit Voucher is named after the logging assertion
      mechanisms that the Registrar then "audits" to enforce local
      policy.  The Registrar mitigates a MiTM Registrar by auditing that
      an unknown MiTM registrar does not appear in the log entries.
      This does not direct prevent the MiTM but provides a response
      mechanism that ensures the MiTM is unsuccessful.  This advantage
      is that actual ownership knowledge is not required on the MASA
      service.

   Nonceless Audit Voucher:  An Audit Voucher without a validity period
      statement.  Fundamentally the same as an Audit Voucher except that
      it can be issued in advance to support network partitions or to
      provide a permanent voucher for remote deployments.

Internet-Draft               Voucher Profile                   June 2017


   Ownership Audit Voucher:  An Audit Voucher where the MASA service has
      verified the Registrar as the authorized owner.  The MASA service
      mitigates a MiTM Registrar by refusing to generate Audit Voucher's
      for unauthorized Registrars.  The Registrar uses audit techniques
      to supplement the MASA.  This provides an ideal sharing of policy
      decisions and enforcement between the vendor and the owner.

   Ownership ID Voucher:  An Ownership ID Voucher is named after
      inclusion of the Pledge's CN-ID or DNS-ID within the voucher.  The
      MASA service mitigates a MiTM Registrar by identifying the
      specific Registrar (via WebPKI) authorized to own the Pledge.

   Bearer Voucher:  A Bearer Voucher is named after the inclusion of a
      Registrar ID wildcard.  Because the Registrar identity is not
      indicated this voucher type must be treated as a secret and
      protected from exposure as any 'bearer' of the voucher can claim
      the Pledge device.  Publishing a nonceless bearer voucher
      effectively turns the specified Pledge into a "TOFU" device with
      minimal mitigation against MiTM Registrars.  Bearer vouchers are
      out-of-scope.

5.  Voucher

   The voucher's purpose is to securely assign a pledge to an owner.
   The voucher informs the pledge which entity it should consider to be
   its owner.

   The voucher is signed a PKCS#7 SignedData structure, as specified by
   Section 9.1 of [RFC2315], encoded using ASN.1 distinguished encoding
   rules (DER), as specified in ITU-T X.690.

   The PKCS#7 structure MUST contain JSON-encoded content conforming to
   the YANG module specified in Section 5.3.

   The PKCS#7 structure MUST also contain a 'signerInfo' structure, as
   described in Section 9.1 of [RFC2315], containing the signature
   generated over the content using the MASA's private key.

   The PKCS#7 structure SHOULD also contain all of the certificates
   leading up to and including the MASA's trust anchor certificate known
   to the pledges.

   The PKCS#7 structure MAY also contain revocation objects for any
   intermediate CAs between the voucher-issuer and the trust anchor
   known to the pledge.

5.2.  Examples

   This section provides a couple Voucher examples for illustration
   purposes.

   The following example illustrates an ephemeral voucher (uses a nonce)
   encoded in JSON.  As is expected with a dynamically-generated
   voucher, only a single pledge (device-identifier) is specified.  The
   MASA generated this voucher using the 'logged' assertion type,
   knowing that it would be suitable for the pledge making the request.

     "ietf-voucher:voucher": {
       "created-on": "2016-10-07T19:31:42Z",

         "subject": "base64-encoded Subject DER"
       },
       "nonce": "base64-encoded octet string"
     }
   }

   The following illustrates a long-lived voucher (no nonce), encoded in
   XML.  This particular voucher applies to more than one pledge

   issued as part of the same purchase order.  This voucher includes
   both a trust anchor certificate (trusted-ca-certificate) as well as

   the trust anchor CA.

6.  Design Considerations

6.1.  Renewals instead of Revocations

   The lifetimes of vouchers may vary.  In some bootstrapping protocols,
   the vouchers may be created and consumed immediately whereas, in
   other bootstrapping solutions, there may be a significant delay
   between when a voucher is created and when it is consumed.  In cases
   when there is a delay, there is a need for the pledge to ensure that
   the assertions made when the voucher was created are still valid when
   it is consumed.

   A revocation artifact is generally used to verify the continued
   validity of an assertion such as a PKIX certificate, web token, or a
   "voucher".  With this approach, a potentially long-lived assertion is
   paired with a reasonably fresh revocation status check to ensure that
   the assertion is still valid.  However, this approach increases
   solution complexity, as it introduces the need for additional
   protocols and code paths to distribute and process the revocations.

   Addressing the short-comings of revocations, this document recommends
   instead the use of lightweight renewals of short-lived non-revocable
   vouchers.  That is, rather than issue a long-lived voucher, the
   expectation is for the MASA to instead issue a short-lived voucher
   along with a promise (reflected in the 'last-renewal-date' field) to
   re-issue the voucher again when needed.  Importantly, while issuing
   the initial voucher may incur heavyweight verification checks (are
   you who you say you are?  does the pledge actually belong to you?),
   re-issuing the voucher should be a lightweight process, as it
   ostensibly only updates the voucher's validatity period.  With this
   approach, there is only the one artifact, and only one code path is
   needed to process it, without any possibility for a pledge to choose
   to skip the revocation status check because, for instance, the OCSP
   Responder is not reachable.

   While this document recommends issuing short-lived vouchers, the
   voucher artifact does not restrict the ability to create a long-lived
   vouchers, if required, however no revocation method is described.

   Note that a voucher may be signed by a chain of intermediate CAs
   leading up to the trust anchor certificate known by the pledge.  Even

Internet-Draft               Voucher Profile                   June 2017


   though the voucher itself is not revocable, it may still be revoked,
   per se, if one of the intermediate CA certificates is revoked.

6.2.  Voucher Per Pledge

   The solution described herein originally enabled a single voucher to
   apply to many pledges, using lists of regular expressions to
   represent ranges of serial numbers.  However, it was determined that
   blocking the renewal of a voucher that applied to many devices would
   be excessive when only the ownership for a single pledge needed to be
   blocked.  Thus, the voucher format now only supports a single serial-
   number to be listed.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Clock Sensitivity

   An attacker could use an expired voucher to gain control over a
   device that has no understand of time.

   To defend against this there are three things: devices are required
   to verify that the expires-on field has not yet passed.  Devices
   without access to time can use nonces to get ephermal vouchers.
   Thirdly, vouchers without expiration times may be used, which will
   appear in the audit log, informing the security decision.

   This document defines artifacts containing time values for voucher
   expirations, which require an accurate clock in order to be processed
   correctly.  Vendors planning on issuing vouchers with expiration
   values must ensure devices have an accurate clock when shipped from
   manufacturing facilities, and take steps to prevent clock tampering.
   If it is not possible to ensure clock accuracy then vouchers with
   expirations should not be issued.

7.2.  Protect Voucher PKI in HSM

   A voucher is signed by a CA, that may itself be signed by a chain of
   CAs leading to a trust anchor known to a pledge.  Revocation checking
   of the intermediate certificates may be difficult in some scenarios.
   The voucher format supports the existing PKIX revocation information
   distribution within the limits of the current PKI technology (a PKCS7
   structure can contain revocation objects as well), but pledges MAY
   accept vouchers without checking X.509 certificate revocation (when
   'domain-cert-revocation-checks' is false).  Without revocation
   checking, a compromized MASA keychain could be used to issue vouchers
   ad infinitum without recourse.  For this reason, MASA implementations
   wanting to support such deployments SHOULD ensure that all the CA

Internet-Draft               Voucher Profile                   June 2017


   private keys used for signing the vouchers are protected by hardware
   security modules (HSMs).

7.3.  Test Domain Certificate Validity when Signing

   If a domain certificate is compromised, then any outstanding vouchers
   for that domain could be used by the attacker.  The domain
   administrator is clearly expected to initiate revocation of any
   domain identity certificates (as is normal in PKI solutions).

   Similarly they are expected to contact the MASA to indicate that an
   outstanding (presumably short lifetime) voucher should be blocked
   from automated renewal.  Protocols for voucher distribution are
   RECOMMENDED to check for revocation of any domain identity
   certificates before automated renewal of vouchers.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document registers a URIs in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-voucher
      Registrant Contact: The ANIMA WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

8.2.  The YANG Module Names Registry

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].  Following the format defined in [RFC6020], the
   the following registration is requested:

      name:         ietf-voucher
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-voucher
      prefix:       vch
