Abstract 

   In order to compute and provide optimal paths, Path Computation 
   Elements (PCEs) require an accurate and timely Traffic Engineering 
   Database (TED). Traditionally this Link State and TE information has 
   been obtained from a link state routing protocol (supporting traffic 
   engineering extensions).  

   This document extends the Path Communication Element Communication 
   Protocol (PCEP) with Link-State and TE information for optical 
   networks.

1. Introduction 

   In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS 
   (GMPLS), a Traffic Engineering Database (TED) is used in computing 
   paths for connection oriented packet services and for circuits. The 
   TED contains all relevant information that a Path Computation 
   Element (PCE) needs to perform its computations. It is important 
   that the TED should be complete and accurate anytime so that the PCE 
   can perform path computations.  

   In MPLS and GMPLS networks, Interior Gateway routing Protocols 
   (IGPs) have been used to create and maintain a copy of the TED at 
   each node. One of the benefits of the PCE architecture [RFC4655] is 
   the use of computationally more sophisticated path computation 
   algorithms and the realization that these may need enhanced 
   processing power not necessarily available at each node 
   participating in an IGP.  

   Section 4.3 of [RFC4655] describes the potential load of the TED on 
   a network node and proposes an architecture where the TED is 
   maintained by the PCE rather than the network nodes. However it does 
   not describe how a PCE would obtain the information needed to 
   populate its TED. PCE may construct its TED by participating in the 
   IGP ([RFC3630] and [RFC5305] for MPLS-TE; [RFC4203] and [RFC5307] 
   for GMPLS). An alternative is offered by [RFC7752]. 

   [RFC7399] touches upon this issue:"It has also been proposed that 
   the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] could be extended to 
   serve as an information collection protocol to supply information 
   from network devices to a PCE. The logic is that the network devices 
   may already speak PCEP and so the protocol could easily be used to 
   report details about the resources and state in the network, 
   including the LSP state discussed in Sections 14 and 15."  

   [RFC8231] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to provide stateful 
   control.  A stateful PCE has access to not only the information 
   carried by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), but also 
   the set of active paths and their reserved resources for its 
   computations. PCC can delegate the rights to modify the LSP 
   parameters to an Active Stateful PCE. This requires PCE to quickly 
   be updated on any changes in the Topology and TEDB, so that PCE can 
   meet the need for updating LSPs effectively and in a timely manner. 
   The fastest way for a PCE to be updated on TED changes is via a 
   direct interface with each network node and with incremental update

   from each network node. [S-PCE-GMPLS] specified the extensions to 
   apply stateful PCE to GMPLS-based networks.  

   [RFC8281] describes the setup, maintenance and teardown of PCE-
   initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model, without the need for 
   local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network 
   that is centrally controlled and deployed. This model requires 
   timely topology and TED update at the PCE.   

   [PCEP-LS-Arch] proposes alternative architecture approaches for 
   learning and maintaining the Link State (and TE)  information 
   directly on a PCE from network nodes as an alternative to IGPs and 
   BGP transport and investigate the impact from the PCE, routing 
   protocol, and network node perspectives.  

   [RFC6805] describes a Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) architecture which 
   can be used for computing end-to-end paths for inter-domain MPLS 
   Traffic Engineering (TE) and GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  
   Within the Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) architecture [RFC6805], the 
   Parent PCE (P-PCE) is used to compute a multi-domain path based on 
   the domain connectivity information.  A Child PCE (C-PCE) may be 
   responsible for a single domain or multiple domains, it is used to 
   compute the intra-domain path based on its domain topology 
   information. 
 
   [Stateful H-PCE] presents general considerations for stateful PCE(s) 
   in hierarchical PCE architecture. In particular, the behavior 
   changes and additions to the existing stateful PCE mechanisms 
   (including PCE-initiated LSP setup and active PCE usage) in the 
   context of networks using the H-PCE architecture. 

   [PCEP-LS] describes a mechanism by which Link State and TE 
   information can be collected from packet networks and shared with 
   PCE with the PCEP itself. This is achieved using a new PCEP message 
   format.  

   This draft describes an optical extension of [PCEP-LS] and explains 
   how encodings suggested by [PCEP-LS] can be used in the optical 
   network contexts.

2. Applicability  

   There are three main applicability of this alternative proposed by 
   this draft: 

       - Case 1: Where there is IGP running in optical network but 
         there is a need for a faster link-state and TE resource 
         collection at the PCE directly from an optical node (PCC) via 
         a PCC-PCE interface.  
          
            o A PCE may receive an incremental update (as opposed to 
              the entire TE information of the node/link). 
                

         Note: A PCE may receive full information from IGP using 
         existing mechanism. In some cases, the convergence of full 
         link-state and TE resource information of the entire network 
         may not be appropriate for certain applications. Incremental 
         update capability will enhance the accuracy of the TE 
         information at a given time.  

          
       - Case 2: Where there is no IGP running in the optical network 
         and there is a need for link-state and TE resource collections 
         at the PCE directly from an optical node (PCC) via a PCC-PCE 
         interface.  
          
      
       - Case 3: Where there is a need for transporting abstract 
         optical link-state and TE information from child PCE and to a 
         parent PCE in H-PCE [RFC6805] and [Stateful H-PCE] as well as 
         for Physical Network Controller (PNC) to Multi-Domain Service 
         Coordinator (MDSC) in Abstraction and Control of TE Networks 
         (ACTN) [RFC8453].  
      
         Note: The applicability for Case 3 may arise as a consequence 
         of Case 1 and Case 2. When TE information changes occur in the 
         optical network, this may also affect abstracted TE 
         information and thus needs to be updated to Parent PCE/MSDC 
         from each child PCE/PNC.

3. Requirements for PCEP extension 

 
   The key requirements associated with link-state (and TE) 
   distribution are identified for PCEP and listed in Section 4 of 
   [PCEP-LS]. These new functions required in PCEP to support 
   distribution of link-state (and TE) information are described in 
   Section 5 of [PCEP-LS]. Details of PCEP messages and related 
   Objects/TLVs are specified in Sections 8 and 9 of [PCEP-LS]. The key 
   requirements and new functions specified in [PCEP-LS] are equally 
   applicable to optical networks.  

   Besides the generic requirements specified in [PCEP-LS], optical 
   specific features also need to be considered in this document. As 
   connection-based network, there are specific parameters such as 
   reachable table, optical latency, wavelength consistency and some 
   other parameters that need to be included during the topology 
   collection. Without these restrictions, the path computation may be 
   inaccurate or infeasible for deployment, therefore these information 
   MUST be included in the PCEP.  

   The procedure on how the optical parameters are used is described in 
   following sections.  

       3.1. Reachable source-destination  

   The reachable source-destination node pair indicates that there are 
   a few number of OCh paths between two nodes. The reachability is 
   restricted by impairment, wavelength consistency and so on. This 
   information is necessary at PCE to promise the path computed between 
   source node and destination node is reachable. In this scenario, the 
   PCE should be responsible to compute how many OCh paths are 
   available to set up connections between source and destination node.  
   Moreover, if a set of optical wavelength is indicated in the path 
   computation request, the PCE should also determine whether a 
   wavelength of the set of preselected optical wavelength is available 
   for the source-destination pair connection.     

   To enable PCE to complete the above functions, the reachable 
   relationship and OMS link information need to be reported to PCE. 
   Once PCE detect that any wavelength is available, the corresponding 
   OMS link should be included in a lambda plane. Then this link can be 
   used for path computation in future.  

   Moreover, in a hierarchical PCE architecture, the information above 
   need to be reported from child PCE to parent PCE, who acts as a 
   service coordinator.

       3.2. Optical latency  

   It is a usual case that the PCC indicates the latency when 
   requesting the path computation. In optical networks the latency is 
   a very sensitive parameter and there is stricter requirement on 
   latency. Given the maximal number of OCh paths between source-
   destination nodes, the PCE also need to determine how many OCh path 
   satisfies the indicated latency threshold.  

   There is usually high-performance algorithm running on the PCE to 
   guarantee the performance of the computed path. During the 
   computation, the delay factor may be converted into a kind of link 
   weight. After the algorithm provides a few candidate paths between 
   the source and destination nodes, the PCE SHOULD be capable to 
   selecting one shortest path by computing the total path propagation 
   delay.  

   Optical PCEs are embedded with optimization algorithm, e.g., 
   shortest path algorithm, to improve the performance of computed 
   path.

       4.3. PCEP-LS for Optical Network Extension 

   This section provides additional PCEP-LS extension necessary to 
   support optical networks parameters discussed in Sections 3.1 and 
   3.2.  

   The link state information collection is usually done before the 
   path computation processing. The procedure can be divided into 1) 
   link state collection by receiving the corresponding topology 
   information in a periodical style; 2) path computation on PCE, 
   triggered by receiving the path computation request message from 
   PCC, and completed by transmitting a path computation reply with the 
   path computation result, per [RFC4655].  

   For OTN networks, max bandwidth available may be per ODU 0/1/2/3 
   switching level or aggregated across all ODU switching levels (i.e., 
   ODUj/k). 

   For WSON networks, RWA information collected from NEs would be 
   utilized to compute light paths. The list of information can be 
   found in [RFC7688]. More specifically, the max bandwidth available 
   may be per lambda/frequency level (OCh) or aggregated across all 
   lambda/frequency level. Per OCh level abstraction gives more 
   detailed data to the P-PCE at the expense of more information 
   processing. Either the OCh-level or the aggregated level abstraction 
   in the RWA constraint (i.e., wavelength continuity) needs to be 
   taken into account by the PCE during path computation. Resource 
   Block Accessibility (i.e., wavelength conversion information) in 
   [RFC7688] needs to be taken into account in order to guarantee the 
   reliability for optical path computation.

5. Security Considerations 

   This document extends PCEP for LS (and TE) distribution including a 
   set of TLVs.  Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this 
   document do not affect the overall PCEP security model.  See 
   [RFC5440], [RFC8253]. The PCE implementation SHOULD provide 
   mechanisms to prevent strains created by network flaps and amount of 
   LS (and TE) information.  Thus it is suggested that any mechanism 
   used for securing the transmission of other PCEP message be applied 
   here as well.  As a general precaution, it is RECOMMENDED that these 
   PCEP extensions only be activated on authenticated and encrypted 
   sessions belonging to the same administrative authority. 
    
6. IANA Considerations 

   This document requests IANA actions to allocate code points for the 
   protocol elements defined in this document. 
    
       6.1. PCEP-LS Sub-TLV Type Indicators 

   This document specifies a set of PCEP-LS Sub-TLVs. IANA is requested 
   to create a "PCEP-LS Sub-TLV Types" sub-registry in the "PCEP TLV 
   Type Indicators" for the sub-TLVs carried in the PCEP-LS TLV (Node 
   Attributes TLV and Link Attributes TLV).
