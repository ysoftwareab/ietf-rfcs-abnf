                        draft-kiesel-alto-h12-02

Abstract

   Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
   pieces of information or server processes, which are available in
   several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but
   is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal
   of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
   guidance to applications, which have to select one or several hosts
   from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
   resource.  This memo proposes the Simple ALTO (H12) protocol.

1.  Introduction

   Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
   pieces of information or server processes, which are available in
   several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but
   is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal
   of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
   guidance to applications, which have to select one or several hosts
   from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
   resource.  This memo proposes the Simple ALTO (H12) protocol.  The
   H12 protocol is a client/server protocol between ALTO clients and
   ALTO servers, where ALTO clients can be either peer-to-peer
   applications residing on end hosts or peer-to-peer tracker servers.

   The basic ideas of ALTO are described in the problem space of ALTO is
   described in [RFC5693] and the set of requirements is discussed in
   [I-D.kiesel-alto-reqs].

   Comments and discussions about this protocol proposal should be
   directed to the ALTO working group: alto@ietf.org.

2.  Protocol Framework

   The ALTO protocol is a client/server protocol, operating between a
   number of ALTO clients and an ALTO server, as sketched in Figure 1

                 +----------+
                 |  ALTO    |
                 |  Server  |

          `.           |           ,'
            `--.       |       _.-'
                `------|-----''
                       v
    +----------+  +----------+   +----------+
    |  ALTO    |  |  ALTO    |...|  ALTO    |
    |  Client  |  |  Client  |   |  Client  |
    +----------+  +----------+   +----------+

                Figure 1: Network Overview of ALTO Protocol

   An ALTO server stores information about preferences (e.g., a list of
   preferred autonomous systems, IP ranges, etc) and ALTO clients can
   retrieve these preferences.  However, there are basically two
   different approaches on where the preferences are actually processed:

   1.  The ALTO server has a list of preferences and clients can
       retrieve this list via the ALTO protocol.  This preference list
       can be partially updated by the server.  The actual processing of
       the data is done on the client and thus there is no data of the
       client's operation revealed to the ALTO server .  This approach
       has been proposed by [I-D.shalunov-alto-infoexport].

   2.  The ALTO server has a list of preferences or preferences
       calculated during runtime and the ALTO client is sending
       information of its operation (e.g., a list of IP addresses) to
       the server.  The server is using this operational information to
       determine its preferences and returns these preferences (e.g., a
       sorted list of the IP addresses) back to the ALTO client.  This
       approach has been initially described in [ACM.ispp2p], but never
       been described on the protocol level.

   Approach 1 (we call it H1) has the advantage (seen from the client)
   that all operational information stays within the client and is not



Kiesel & Stiemerling    Expires September 9, 2010               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                    SALTO                       March 2010


   revealed to the provider of the server.  On the other hand, does
   approach 1 require that the provider of the ALTO server, i.e., the
   network operator, reveals information about its network structure
   (e.g., AS numbers, IP ranges, topology information in general) to the
   ALTO client.

   Approach 2 (we call it H2) has the advantage (seen from the operator)
   that all operational information stays with the ALTO server and is
   not revealed to the ALTO client.  On the other hand, does approach 2
   require that the clients send their operational information to the
   server.

   Both approaches have their pros and cons and are extensively
   discussed on the ALTO mailing list.  But there is basically a
   dilemma: Approach 1 is seen as the only working solution by peer-to-
   peer software vendors and approach 2 is seen as the only working by
   the network operators.  But neither the software vendors nor the
   operators seem to willing to change their position.  However, there
   is the need to get both sides on board, to come to a solution.

   Therefore, this does memo proposes to integrate both approaches in
   one protocol and offer a way for clients and servers to learn each
   preferred way of operating.

3.  H12 Operational Model

   The P4P protocol proposal [I-D.penno-alto-protocol] assumes that the
   ALTO server maintains two different databases that store the server-
   side information necessary to guide ALTO clients.  There is the
   network map that provides a mapping between network prefixes and a
   macro called partition ID (PID) and the cost map that relates PIDs to
   costs.

   H12 assumes also that the H12 server internally maintains two maps,
   one for the network partitioning and the other for the associated
   costs, but does not need that the information stored in these maps is
   also conveyed to the H12 client in one piece.  However, this memo is
   not specifying how the server is implemented, it is only specifying
   the ALTO protocol.

   The client puts one or several host location attributes, about which
   it wants to receive a rating, in the query message.

   The server replies with a list of network location attributes, in the
   same format as in the query, and the respective ratings for the
   requested attributes.  However, the number of lines in this list may
   be shorter or longer than in the query, and the prefix lengths may be
   different:

   o  The server may decide not to give any rating for a specific
      location attribute.  In this case, a default value applies.

   o  Instead of rating several location attributes with long prefix
      lengths (in particular: individual IP addresses) individually, the
      server may decide to give only one rating for a broader address
      range (i.e., prefix length is shorter).

   o  Instead of giving one rating for a large address range, the server
      may decide to give several ratings for smaller ranges (i.e., i.e.,
      each returned entry has a prefix length that is longer that
      requested).

   The actual rating is given for each rating criterion as a signed
   integer value.  A value of zero (0) means "default value".  This
   value is to be used if the server has no information regarding this
   (network location attribute, rating criteria) tuple, or if it does
   not want to disclose it.  Positive values mean that this location is
   "better" than default and therefore should be preferred for peer
   selection, while negative values indicate the location to be "worse"
   than default and therefore that it should be avoided.  The meaning of
   "better" and "worse", as well as the scale has to be defined
   individually for each rating criterion.

   This approach gives both sides, i.e., server and clients, to still
   exchange their desired information and level of precision, but also
   gives the chance to hide information if necessary and desired.

4.  Proposed Protocol Semantics

   H12 uses HTTP/1.1 and TCP as transport protocol between H12 clients
   and H12 servers.  The encoding of the message body is done with XML.
   The usage of HTTP is similar to [I-D.penno-alto-protocol] also with
   the intention to reuse existing HTTP software and deployments.

   H12 is aiming at keeping the level of involvement of the application
   that is using ALTO as low as possible.  I.e., requiring an
   application, such as p2p file sharing, to use ALTO is already a
   considerable step.  The implementers of the application must be able
   to use ALTO with a very low effort.  It is assumed that the
   complexity of ALTO, in terms of implementation and operational
   effort, is mainly handled at the server.

   Unlike the H1H2 protocol[I-D.stiemerling-alto-h1h2-protocol] the H12
   protocol does not have several modes of operation, which have to be
   negotiated at the startup.  Instead it allows the client and the
   server some flexibility in the requests and the responses while using
   only on mode of operation.

4.1.  Locating the H12 Server Capabilities

   H12 clients initially need to locate the right H12 server that is in
   charge of serving them.  This step and the technical solution to
   locate such ALTO server is currently discussed within the ALTO
   working group.  This memo does not yet define such H12 server
   discovery.

4.2.  Learning the H12 Server Capabilities

   This section describes how an ALTO client can learn about the
   capabilities of the ALTO server.

   H12 clients initially need to locate the right H12 server that is in
   charge of serving them.  This step and the technical solution to
   locate such ALTO server is currently discussed within the ALTO
   working group.  This memo does not yet define such H12 server
   discovery.

   The first step for a H12 client, before it can start querying for
   ALTO guidance, is to request the H12 server capabilities.  The server
   capabilities are, e.g., administrative information (operator of the
   server, contact addresses, etc), the supported host location
   attributes (IP addresses or IP prefixes), the supported rating
   criteria, and the URIs to query for ALTO guidance.  The H12 protocol
   uses only a single static URI path for retrieving the capability
   information.  All other query URIs are announced by the server during

Internet-Draft                    SALTO                       March 2010


   the capability retrieval.

4.3.  Redirection

   There are basically two cases where a H12 server has to redirect
   request to other locations:

   a.  the queried H12 server is overload and can tell about other H12
       server;

   b.  the queried H12 server is overload and cannot tell about other
       H12 server;

   c.  the queried H12 server is solely used as entry point and
       redirects the actual H12 server;

   d.  the querying host in not allowed to use this ALTO server (e.g.,
       host in ISP1 is querying ALTO server in ISP2) (which is a sub
       case of (a)).

4.4.  Querying the ALTO Server

   An ALTO client can query on its own or on behalf of other peers
   (e.g., a tracker).  This is indicated in the resource consumer host
   location attribute rc_hla in the ALTO query.  The query body itself
   contains the list of IP addresses or IP prefixes the ALTO client is
   asking guidance for.  This shows a example list Figure 2 of IP
   addresses queried for

                        Figure 3: XML encoded Query

   This ipprefix tag carries a full IP address or an IP address prefix,
   leaving the client the choice how much of an IP address it wants to
   reveal to the server.  That is, the client can request information
   for one or several specific IP addresses (prefix length equal 32 or
   128), for address ranges, or for "the whole Internet" (prefix length
   equal 0).  However, the "whole Internet" is not really referring to
   the whole Internet as such, as no single entity can have such a big
   knowledge, but to whatever broader scope the server can give guidance
   about.  This scope can include, for instance, its own complete
   network.

   Furthermore, the client specifies one or several rating criteria,
   such as operator preference, lower bound for delay, etc.  Here is a
   work-in-progress list of such rating criteria, consisting of two
   levels of rating criteria offered to the client are:

   o  Primary rating criterion

   o  Further rating criteria

   The offered rating criteria are:

   o  operator's relative preference

   o  Topological distance (Number of AS hops)

   o  minimum boundary for upload bandwidth

4.5.  ALTO Server Response

   This section discussions at this of point of time only a positive
   reply.  All other cases are TBD in this write-up.  The listed
   response is shortened, see Section 1 for the full answer.  The
   examplatory answer is listed for the IP address 193.141.139.237/32
   and 202.103.147.132/32, and for the IP prefix 129.13.0.0/16.

   The rating response given in the candidate host location attributes
   (cnd_hla) is different for the single requests, depending on what
   information can be delivered by the server.  For 193.141.139.237/32,
   the server replies with two prefixes belonging to the same ISP.  For
   202.103.147.132/32, the server replies with even more details about
   other prefixes belonging to the same operator.  The ensures that the
   client automatically learns even more prefixes the operator gives the
   same guidance for.  A simple response is shown for the query about
   129.13.0.0/16, where the response contains only the same prefixes as
   in the request.

   The response contains also a resource consumer host location
   attribute (rc_hla).  This rc_hla echos partially the information from
   the request, but gives actually guidance to the ALTO client in what
   scope this information can be distributed amongst other peers.  In
   this response, the server allows the redistribution of the received
   guidance to peers with the IP prefix 195.37.0.0/16.

5.  Security Considerations

   This initial version of this memo does not yet a full security
   considerations, but they will be added in future revision.

   minimum boundary for upload bandwidth (AKA provisioned upload
   bandwidth): criminal suspects can easily re-use the geographical
   coordinates of an IP address (taken from whois) and google maps to
   correlate IP addresses and wealth of subscribers of that IP address.
