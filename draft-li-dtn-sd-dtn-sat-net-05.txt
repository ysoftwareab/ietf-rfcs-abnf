Abstract

   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) is designed for a severe
   environment where communication quality is not guaranteed. It works
   as an overlay network associated with Bundle Protocol (BP) and some
   convergence layer protocols like Licklider Transmission Protocol
   (LTP). DTN is suitable for satellite networks. Because communication
   delay is long and peer-to-peer communication is not guaranteed in
   satellite networks. We implement SDN to solve the problems of
   controllable, manageable, and flexible in satellite networks. In
   this document, we propose a framework of Software Defined DTN-based
   satellite networks, using Bundle tunnel and protocol translation
   gateway.

1. Introduction

   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) [RFC4838] is designed for
   a severe environment where connectivity of network is intermittent
   and communication quality is not guaranteed. It works as an overlay
   network associated with Bundle Protocol (BP) [RFC5050] and
   convergence layer protocols like Licklider Transmission Protocol
   (LTP) [RFC5325] [RFC5326].

   We implement DTN in the satellite networks to meet the need of high
   transmission delay with the help of Interplanetary Overlay Network
   (ION) [BURLEIGH07]. ION is an implementation of DTN architecture and
   is designed to enable inexpensive insertion of DTN functionality
   into embedded systems.

   SDN [NUNES14] is a state-of-the-art network concept, introducing new
   possibilities for network management and configuration methods by
   decoupling the control decisions from forwarding hardware. A
   controller communicates with the switches by southbound interface,
   such as OpenFlow [LARA14], which is the core technology of SDN. We
   apply the idea of SDN to satellite network by separating control
   plane and forwarding plane in satellite network control structure
   and taking advantage of the global view of a controller.

   In this document, we propose a framework of Software Defined DTN-
   based satellite networks, using Bundle tunnel to deploy OpenFlow
   over DTN and protocol translation gateway to achieve protocol
   translation between Bundle packets and IP packets.

3. Key points of the design

   The idea of SDN is applied in the proposed framework. The control
   link between the control plane and the forwarding plane is Bundle
   tunnel. Because we use DTN protocol stack in space network and the
   protocol stack of ground network is TCP/IP. There should be a

   protocol translation gateway to achieve protocol translation between
   Bundle packets and IP packets.

                  Figure 1 Illustration of the two planes

   We apply the idea of SDN to satellite network by separating control
   plane and forwarding plane in satellite network control structure
   and taking advantage of the global view of a controller. The whole
   space network is divided into two parts, control plane and
   forwarding plane. The control plane contains Geosynchronous Earth
   Orbit (GEO) satellites, on which SDN controllers are deployed. The
   forwarding plane contains Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites and
   Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, and OpenFlow enabled switches are
   deployed on them.

   We implement DTN with the help of ION in space network. The topology
   configuration mode of ION is reading the configuration scripts (.rc
   file), which contains the information of connections and nodes. As
   is shown in Figure 1, to achieve the goal of separating the control
   plane and forwarding plane in the space network, we adopt two set of
   unrelated ION configuration scripts when creating the topology. One
   is the script of Bundle tunnel (or we can say the control link). The

   other one is the script of data link. Two ION processes run in the
   MEO/LEO satellite nodes without affecting each other.

                 Figure 2 Illustration of bundle tunnel

   We deploy OpenFlow over DTN by a method of tunnel. That is,
   signaling packets are transmitted in bundle tunnel when controller
   (GEO satellite) sets up connection to switches (MEO satellites) and
   when controllers send instructions to switches. The encapsulation
   format of the bundle tunnel is shown in Figure 2. Because DTN is
   implemented in ION in an overlay way, the first half of the Bundle
   tunnel header is the same as normal IP packets. The difference is
   that there are a 4-byte LTP header, a 14-byte Primary Bundle header,
   and a 5-byte Payload header before the payload data field due to the
   protocol stack of DTN. The link layer field is removed from the
   OpenFlow signaling packets between controller and switches and then
   the remaining fields are encapsulated in payload data.

   The design of the Bundle tunnel adopts a dual process approach. One
   process is responsible for receiving OpenFlow signaling packets from

   the local controller or switches. Then signaling data are separated
   out and encapsulated in the Bundle packets. Finally, the Bundle
   packets are sent to the control link. The other process is
   responsible for receiving Bundle packets from the control link and
   decapsulating the Bundle packets and get the OpenFlow signaling
   data. Then the signaling data are sent to the local controller or
   switches. In this way, the SDN controller in GEO satellite can
   communicate with the OpenFlow enabled switches in MEO/LEO
   satellites.

                        Figure 3 Protocol stacks

   We use DTN protocol stack in space network and TCP/IP stack in the
   terrestrial network, so there should be protocol translation for
   data transmission and service delivery in the Software Defined DTN-
   based satellite networks framework. We develop DTN to TCP/IP
   bidirectional protocol translation and deploy this function on the
   satellite gateways. We deploy DTN with Interplanetary Overlay
   Network (ION) and modify ION to adapt to IPv6. In this way, ION is
   IPv4/6 dual stack. If the ground nodes run in IPv6 stack, there is
   no need for complex protocol translation between IPv4 and IPv6 at
   the satellite gateway.

   The protocol stacks of the ground node, satellite gateway node, and
   satellite node are shown in Figure 3. The physical layer and the
   data link layer are omitted because they are not involved in the
   proposed framework. The bidirectional translation between IP packets
   that belongs to TCP/IP stack and the Bundle packets that belongs to
   DTN stack is achieved at the satellite gateway by adopting

              Figure 4 Use case of the proposed framework

   The use case of proposed framework is shown in Figure 4. The GEO
   satellite set up control link to the four MEO/LEO satellites. The
   data center data are transmitted among the four MEO/LEO satellites.
   The ION configuration script of the control plane is about the
   connections of one GEO satellite to four MEO/LEO satellites. The ION
   configuration script of the forwarding plane is about the

   connections among the four MEO/LEO satellites. That is to say, two
   sets of unrelated ION processes are running in the four MEO/LEO
   satellites.

   A user applies for data from the data center via satellite networks.
   The traffic is sent to satellite gateway 1 and converted from IP
   packets to Bundle packets. The controller in GEO satellite send
   instructions to the MEO/LEO satellites and configure the flow tables
   of the switches in MEO/LEO satellites. Then the traffic is forwarded
   via the path: satellite2-->satellite3-->satellite4 under control of
   GEO satellite. Then, the traffic is sent to satellite gateway 2 and
   converted from Bundle packets to IP packets. Finally, the data are
   sent to the user.



5. Security Considerations

   Introducing SDN in DTN-based space network can bring in some
   problems that any SDN-based frameworks have. The proposed framework
   adopts a centralized control architecture. So if GEO satellite is
   attacked (by viruses or physical attack), security problem should be
   considered. The possible solution may be reserving spare GEO
   satellite. When the GEO satellite in use breaks down, the spare one
   will take on the responsibility.



6. IANA Considerations

   This document does not update or create any IANA registries.



7. Conclusions

   This document describes the key points of the design of the proposed
   Software Defined DTN-based satellite networks framework: Separated
   control plane and forwarding plane in space network, Bundle tunnel,
   and satellite protocol translation gateway. And we describe the use
   case of the proposed framework in this document.
