1.  Introduction

   Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE-LSPs) are connection
   oriented tunnels in packet and non-packet networks [RFC3209],
   [RFC3945].  TE-LSPs may reserve network resources for use by the
   traffic they carry, thus providing some guarantees of service
   delivery and allowing a network operator to plan the use of the
   resources across the whole network.

   In some technologies (such as wavelength switched optical networks)
   the resource is synonymous with the label that is switched on the
   path of the LSP so that it is not possible to establish an LSP that
   can carry traffic without assigning a concrete resource to the LSP.
   In other technologies (such as packet switched networks) the
   resources assigned to an LSP are a measure of the capacity of a link
   that is dedicated for use by the traffic on the LSP.  In all cases,
   network planning consists of selecting paths for LSPs through the

   network so that there will be no contention for resources; LSP
   establishment is the act of setting up an LSP and reserving resources
   within the network; and network optimization or re-optimization is
   the process of re-positioning LSPs in the network to make the
   unreserved network resources more useful for potential future LSPs
   while ensuring that the established LSPs continue to fulfill their
   objectives.

   It is often the case that it is known that an LSP will be needed at
   some time in the future.  While a path for that LSP could be computed
   using knowledge of the currently established LSPs and the currently
   available resources, this does not give any degree of certainty that
   the necessary resources will be available when it is time to set up
   the new LSP.  Yet setting up the LSP ahead of the time when it is
   needed (which would guarantee the availability of the resources) is
   wasteful since the network resources could be used for some other
   purpose in the meantime.

   Similarly, it may be known that an LSP will no longer be needed after
   some future time and that it will be torn down releasing the network
   resources that were assigned to it.  This information can be helpful
   in planning how a future LSP is placed in the network.

   Time-Scheduled (TS) reservation of TE resources can be used to
   provide resource booking for TE-LSPs so as to better guarantee
   services for customers and to improve the efficiency of network
   resource usage into the future.  This document provides a framework
   that describes and discusses the architecture for the scheduled
   reservation of TE resources.  This document does not describe
   specific protocols or protocol extensions needed to realize this
   service.

2.  Problem Statement

2.1.  Provisioning TE-LSPs and TE Resources

   TE-LSPs in existing networks are provisioned using RSVP-TE as a
   signaling protocol [RFC3209] [RFC3473], by direct control of network
   elements such as in the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm,
   and using the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] as a
   control protocol.

   TE resources are reserved at the point of use.  That is, the
   resources (wavelengths, timeslots, bandwidth, etc.) are reserved for
   use on a specific link and are tracked by the Label Switching Routers
   (LSRs) at the end points of the link.  Those LSRs learn which
   resources to reserve during the LSP setup process.

Internet-Draft         Scheduled Use of Resources           January 2017


   The use of TE resources can be varied by changing the parameters of
   the LSP that uses them, and the resources can be released by tearing
   down the LSP.

2.2.  Selecting the Path of an LSP

   Although TE-LSPs can determine their paths hop-by-hop using the
   shortest path toward the destination to route the signaling protocol
   messages [RFC3209], in practice this option is not applied because it
   does not look far enough ahead into the network to verify that the
   desired resources are available.  Instead, the full length of the
   path of an LSP is computed ahead of time either by the head-end LSR
   of a signaled LSP, or by Path Computation Element (PCE) functionality
   in a dedicated server or built into network management software
   [RFC4655].

   Such full-path computation is applied in order that an end-to-end
   view of the available resources in the network can be used to
   determine the best likelihood of establishing a viable LSP that meets
   the service requirements.  Even in this situation, however, it is
   possible that two LSPs being set up at the same time will compete for
   scarce network resources meaning that one or both of them will fail
   to be established.  This situation is avoided by using a centralized
   PCE that is aware of the LSP setup requests that are in progress.

2.3.  Planning Future LSPs

   LSPs may be established "on demand" when the requester determines
   that a new LSP is needed.  In this case, the path of the LSP is
   computed as described in Section 2.2.

   However, in many situations, the requester knows in advance that an
   LSP will be needed at a particular time in the future.  For example,
   the requester may be aware of a large traffic flow that will start at
   a well-known time, perhaps for a database synchronization or for the
   exchange of content between streaming sites.  Furthermore, the
   requester may also know for how long the LSP is required before it
   can be torn down.

   The set of requests for future LSPs could be collected and held in a
   central database (such as at a Network Management System - NMS): when
   the time comes for each LSP to be set up the NMS can ask the PCE to
   compute a path and can then request the LSP to be provisioned.  This
   approach has a number of drawbacks because it is not possible to
   determine in advance whether it will be possible to deliver the LSP
   since the resources it needs might be used by other LSPs in the
   network.  Thus, at the time the requester asks for the future LSP,




Zhuang, et al.            Expires July 7, 2017                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Scheduled Use of Resources           January 2017


   the NMS can only make a best-effort guarantee that the LSP will be
   set up at the desired time.

   A better solution, therefore, is for the requests for future LSPs to
   be serviced at once.  The paths of the LSPs can be computed ahead of
   time and converted into reservations of network resources during
   specific windows in the future.

2.4.  Looking at Future Demands on TE Resources

   While path computation as described in Section 2.2 takes account of
   the currently available network resources, and can act to place LSPs
   in the network so that there is the best possibility of future LSPs
   being accommodated, it cannot handle all eventualities.  It is simple
   to construct scenarios where LSPs that are placed one at a time lead
   to future LSPs being blocked, but where foreknowledge of all of the
   LSPs would have made it possible for them all to be set up.

   If, therefore, we were able to know in advance what LSPs were going
   to be requested we could plan for them and ensure resources were
   available.  Furthermore, such an approach enables a commitment to be
   made to a service user that an LSP will be set up and available at a
   specific time.

   This service can be achieved by tracking the current use of network
   resources and also a future view of the resource usage.  We call this
   Time-Scheduled TE (TS-TE) resource reservation.

2.5.  Requisite State Information

   In order to achieve the TS-TE resource reservation, the use of
   resources on the path needs to be scheduled.  Scheduling state is
   used to indicate when resources are reserved and when they are
   available for use.

   A simple information model for one piece of scheduling state is as
   follows:

      {
        link id;
        resource id or reserved capacity;
        reservation start time;
        reservation end time
      }

   The resource that is scheduled can be link capacity, physical
   resources on a link, CPU utilization, memory, buffers on an
   interfaces, etc.  The resource might also be the maximal unreserved



Zhuang, et al.            Expires July 7, 2017                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         Scheduled Use of Resources           January 2017


   bandwidth of the link over a time interval.  For any one resource
   there could be multiple pieces of scheduling state, and for any one
   link, the timing windows might overlap.

   There are multiple ways to realize this information model and
   different ways to store the data.  The resource state could be
   expressed as a start time and an end time as shown above, or could be
   expressed as a start time and a duration.  Multiple periods, possibly
   of different lengths, may be associated with one reservation request,
   and a reservation might repeat on a regular cycle.  Furthermore, the
   current state of network reservation could be kept separate from the
   scheduled usage, or everything could be merged into a single TS
   database.

   This scheduling state information can be used by applications to book
   resources for future or now, so as to maximize chance of services
   being delivered.  Also, it can avoid contention for resources of
   LSPs.

   Note that it is also necessary to store the information about future
   LSPs.  This information is held to allow the LSPs to be instantiated
   when they are due and using the paths/resources that have been
   computed for them, but also to provide correlation with the TS-TE
   resource reservations so that it is clear why resources were reserved
   allowing pre-emption and handling release of reserved resources in
   the event of cancellation of future LSPs.

3.  Architectural Concepts

   This section examines several important architectural concepts that
   lead to design decisions that will influence how networks can achieve
   TS-TE in a scalable and robust manner.

3.1.  Where is Scheduling State Held?

   The scheduling state information described in Section 2.5 has to be
   held somewhere.  There are two places where this makes sense:

   o  In the network nodes where the resources exist;

   o  In a central scheduling controller where decisions about resource
      allocation are made.

   The first of these makes policing of resource allocation easier.  It
   means that many points in the network can request immediate or
   scheduled LSPs with the associated resource reservation and that all
   such requests can be correlated at the point where the resources are




Zhuang, et al.            Expires July 7, 2017                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Scheduled Use of Resources           January 2017


   allocated.  However, this approach has some scaling and technical
   problems:

   o  The most obvious issue is that each network node must retain the
      full time-based state for all of its resources.  In a busy network
      with a high arrival rate of new LSPs and a low hold time for each
      LSP, this could be a lot of state.  Yet network nodes are normally
      implemented with minimal spare memory.

   o  In order that path computation can be performed, the computing
      entity normally known as a Path Computation Element (PCE)
      [RFC4655] needs access to a database of available links and nodes
      in the network, and of the TE properties of the links.  This
      database is known as the Traffic Engineering Database (TED) and is
      usually populated from information advertised in the IGP by each
      of the network nodes or exported using BGP-LS [RFC7752].  To be
      able to compute a path for a future LSP the PCE needs to populate
      the TED with all of the future resource availability: if this
      information is held on the network nodes it must also be
      advertised in the IGP.  This could be a significant scaling issue
      for the IGP and the network nodes as all of the advertised
      information is held at every network node and must be periodically
      refreshed by the IGP.

   o  When a normal node restarts it can recover resource reservation
      state from the forwarding hardware, from Non-Volatile Random-
      Access Memory (NVRAM), or from adjacent nodes through the
      signaling protocol [RFC5063].  If scheduling state is held at the
      network nodes it must also be recovered after the restart of a
      network node.  This cannot be achieved from the forwarding
      hardware because the reservation will not have been made, could
      require additional expensive NVRAM, or might require that all
      adjacent nodes also have the scheduling state in order to re-
      install it on the restarting node.  This is potentially complex
      processing with scaling and cost implications.

   Conversely, if the scheduling state is held centrally it is easily
   available at the point of use.  That is, the PCE can utilize the
   state to plan future LSPs and can update that stored information with
   the scheduled reservation of resources for those future LSPs.  This
   approach also has several issues:

   o  If there are multiple controllers then they must synchronize their
      stored scheduling state as they each plan future LSPs, and must
      have a mechanism to resolve resource contention.  This is
      relatively simple and is mitigated by the fact that there is ample
      processing time to re-plan future LSPs in the case of resource
      contention.

Internet-Draft         Scheduled Use of Resources           January 2017


   o  If other sources of immediate LSPs are allowed (for example, other
      controllers or autonomous action by head-end LSRs) then the
      changes in resource availability caused by the setup or tear down
      of these LSPs must be reflected in the TED (by use of the IGP as
      currently) and may have an impact of planned future LSPs.  This
      impact can be mitigated by re-planning future LSPs or through LSP
      preemption.

   o  If other sources of planned LSPs are allowed, they can request
      path computation and resource reservation from the centralized PCE
      using PCEP [RFC5440].

   o  If the scheduling state is held centrally at a PCE, the state must
      be held and restored after a system restart.  This is relatively
      easy to achieve on a central server that can have access to non-
      volatile storage.  The PCE could also synchronize the scheduling
      state with other PCEs after restart.  See Section 4.2 for details.

   o  Of course, a centralized system must store information about all
      of the resources in the network.  In a busy network with a high
      arrival rate of new LSPs and a low hold time for each LSP, this
      could be a lot of state.  This is multiplied by the size of the
      network measured both by the number of links and nodes, and by the
      number of trackable resources on each link or at each node.  The
      challenge may be mitigated by the centralized server being
      dedicated hardware, but the problem of collecting the information
      from the network is only solved if the central server has full
      control of the booking of resources and the establishment of new
      LSPs.

   Thus the architectural conclusion is that scheduling state should be
   held centrally at the point of use and not in the network devices.

3.2.  What State is Held?

   As already described, the PCE needs access to an enhanced, time-based
   TED.  It stores the traffic engineering (TE) information such as
   bandwidth for every link for a series of time intervals.  There are a
   few ways to store the TE information in the TED.  For example,
   suppose that the amount of the unreserved bandwidth at a priority
   level for a link is Bj in a time interval from time Tj to Tk (k =
   j+1), where j = 0, 1, 2, ....

             Figure 1: A Plot of Bandwidth Usage against Time

   The unreserved bandwidth for the link can be represented and stored
   in the TED as [T0, B0], [T1, B1], [T2, B2], [T3, B3], ... as shown in
   Figure 1.

   But it must be noted that service requests for future LSPs are known
   in terms of the LSPs whose paths are computed and for which resources
   are scheduled.  For example, if the requester of a future LSP decides
   to cancel the request or to modify the request, the PCE must be able
   to map this to the resources that were reserved.  When the LSP or the
   request for the LSP with a number of time intervals is cancelled, the
   PCE must release the resources that were reserved on each of the
   links along the path of the LSP in every time intervals from the TED.
   If the bandwidth reserved on a link for the LSP is B from time T2 to
   T3 and the unreserved bandwidth on the link is B2 from T2 to T3, B is
   added to the link for the time interval from T2 to T3 and the
   unreserved bandwidth on the link from T2 to T3 will be B2 + B.

   This suggests that the PCE needs an LSP Database (LSP-DB)
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] that contains information not only about
   LSPs that are active in the network, but also those that are planned.
   The information for an LSP stored in the LSP-DB includes for each
   time interval that applies to the LSP: the time interval, the paths
   computed for the LSP satisfying the constraints in the time interval,
   and the resources such as bandwidth reserved for the LSP in the time
   interval.  See also Section 2.3

   It is an implementation choice how the TED and LSP-DB are stored both
   for dynamic use and for recovery after failure or restart, but it may
   be noted that all of the information in the scheduled TED can be
   recovered from the active network state and from the scheduled LSP-
   DB.

      Figure 2: Reference Architecture for Scheduled Use of Resources

4.1.  Service Request

   As shown in Figure 2, some component in the network requests a
   service.  This may be an application, an NMS, an LSR, or any
   component that qualifies as a Path Computation Client (PCC).  We show
   this on the figure as the "Service Requester" and it sends a request
   to the PCE for an LSP to be set up at some time (either now or in the
   future).  The request, indicated on Figure 2 by the arrow (a),
   includes all of the parameters of the LSP that the requester wishes
   to supply such as bandwidth, start time, and end time.  Note that the

Internet-Draft         Scheduled Use of Resources           January 2017


   requester in this case may be the LSR shown in the figure or may be a
   distinct system.

   The PCE enters the LSP request in its LSP-DB (b), and uses
   information from its TED (c) to compute a path that satisfies the
   constraints (such as bandwidth) for the LSP in the time interval from
   the start time to the end time.  It updates the future resource
   availability in the TED so that further path computations can take
   account of the scheduled resource usage.  It stores the path for the
   LSP into the LSP-DB (b).

   When it is time (i.e., at the start time) for the LSP to be set up,
   the PCE sends a PCEP Initiate request to the head end LSR (d)
   providing the path to be signaled as well as other parameters such as
   the bandwidth of the LSP.

   As the LSP is signaled between LSRs (f) the use of resources in the
   network is updated and distributed using the IGP.  This information
   is shared with the PCE either through the IGP or using BGP-LS (e),
   and the PCE updates the information stored in its TED (c).

   After the LSP is set up, the head end LSR sends a PCEP LSP State
   Report (PCRpt message) to the PCE (d).  The report contains the
   resources such as bandwidth usage for the LSP.  The PCE updates the
   status of the LSP in the LSP-DB according to the report.

   When an LSP is no longer required (either because the Service
   Requester has cancelled the request, or because the LSP's scheduled
   lifetime has expired) the PCE can remove it.  If the LSP is currently
   active, the PCE instructs the head-end LSR to tear it down (d), and
   the network resource usage will be updated by the IGP and advertised
   back to the PCE through the IGP or BGP-LS (e).  Once the LSP is no
   longer active, the PCE can remove it from the LSP-DB (b).

4.2.  Initialization and Recovery

   When a PCE in the architecture shown in Figure 2 is initialized, it
   must learn state from the network, from its stored databases, and
   potentially from other PCEs in the network.

   The first step is to get an accurate view of the topology and
   resource availability in the network.  This would normally involve
   reading the state direct from the network via the IGP or BGP-LS (e),
   but might include receiving a copy of the TED from another PCE.  Note
   that a TED stored from a previous instantiation of the PCE is
   unlikely to be valid.

Internet-Draft         Scheduled Use of Resources           January 2017


   Next, the PCE must construct a time-based TED to show scheduled
   resource usage.  How it does this is implementation specific and this
   document does not dictate any particular mechanism: it may recover a
   time-based TED previously saved to non-volatile storage, or it may
   reconstruct the time-based TED from information retrieved from the
   LSP-DB previously saved to non-volatile storage.  If there is more
   than one PCE active in the network, the recovering PCE will need to
   synchronize the LSP-DB and time-based TED with other PCEs (see
   Section 4.3).

   Note that the stored LSP-DB needs to include the intended state and
   actual state of the LSPs so that when a PCE recovers it is able to
   determine what actions are necessary.

4.3.  Synchronization Between PCEs

   If there is more than one PCE that supports scheduling active in the
   network, it is important to achieve some consistency between the
   scheduled TED and scheduled LSP-DB held by the PCEs.

   [RFC7399] answers various questions around synchronization between
   the PCEs.  It should be noted that the time-based "scheduled"
   information adds another dimension to the issue of synchronization
   between PCEs.  It should also be noted that a deployment may use a
   primary PCE and the have other PCEs as backup, where a backup PCE can
   take over only in the event of a failure of the primary PCE.
   Alternatively, the PCEs may share the load at all times.  The choice
   of the synchronization technique is largely dependent on the
   deployment of PCEs in the network.

   One option for ensuring that multiple PCEs use the same scheduled
   information is simply to have the PCEs driven from the same shared
   database, but it is likely to be inefficient and interoperation
   between multiple implementations will be harder.

   Another option is for each PCE to be responsible for its own
   scheduled database and to utilize some distributed database
   synchronization mechanism to have consistent information.  Depending
   on the implementation, this could be efficient, but interoperation
   between heterogeneous implementations is still hard.

   A further approach is to utilize PCEP messages to synchronize the
   scheduled state between PCEs.  This approach would work well if the
   number of PCEs which support scheduling is small, but as the number
   increases considerable message exchange needs to happen to keep the
   scheduled databases synchronized.  Future solutions could also
   utilize some synchronization optimization techniques for efficiency.
   Another variation would be to request information from other PCEs for



Zhuang, et al.            Expires July 7, 2017                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         Scheduled Use of Resources           January 2017


   a particular time slice, but this might have impact on the
   optimization algorithm.

5.  Multi-Domain Considerations

   Multi-domain path computation usually requires some form of
   cooperation between PCEs each of which has responsibility for
   determining a segment of the end-to-end path in the domain for which
   it has computationonal responsiblity.  When computing a scheduled
   path, resources need to be booked in all of the domains that the path
   will cross so that they are available when the LSP is finlly
   signalled.

   Per-domain path computation [RFC5152] is not an appropriate mechanism
   when a scheduled LSP is being computed because the computation
   requests at downstream PCEs are only triggered by signaling.
   However, a similar mechanism could be used where cooperating PCEs
   exchange PCReq messages for a scheduled LSP as shown in Figure 3.  In
   this case the service requester asks for a scheduled LSP that will
   span two domains (a).  PCE1 computes a path across Domain 1 and
   reserves the resources, and also asks PCE2 to compute and reserve in
   Domain 2 (b).  PCE2 may return a full path, or could return a path
   key [RFC5520].  When it is time for LSP setup PCE1 triggers the head-
   end LSR (c) and the LSP is signaled (d).  If a path key is used, the
   entry LSR in Domain 2 will consult PCE2 for the path expansion (e)
   before completing signaling (f).

         Figure 3: Per-Domain Path Computation for Scheduled LSPs

   Another mechanism for PCE cooperation in multi-domain LSP setup is
   Backward- Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) [RFC5441].  This approach
   relies on the downstream domain supply a variety of potential paths
   to the upstream domain.  Although BRPC can arrive at a more optimal
   end-to-end path than per-domain path computation, it is not well
   suited to LSP scheduling because the downstream PCE would need to
   reserve resources on all of the potential paths and then release
   those that the upstream PCE announced it did not plan to use.

   Finally we should consider hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) [RFC6805].  This
   mode of operatation is similar to that shown in Figure 3, but a
   parent PCE is used to coordinate the requests to the child PCEs
   resulting in better visibility of the end-to-end path and better
   coordination of the resource booking.  The sequenced flow of control
   is shown in Figure 4.

    Figure 4: Hierarchical PCE for Path Computation for Scheduled LSPs

6.  Security Considerations

   The protocol implications of scheduled resources are unchanged from
   "on-demand" LSP computation and setup.  A discussion of securing PCEP
   is found in [RFC5440] and work to extend that security is provided in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pceps].  Furthermore, the path key mechanism described
   in [RFC5520] can be used to enhance privacy and security.

   Similarly, there is no change to the security implications for the
   signaling of scheduled LSPs.  A discussion of the security of the
   signaling protocols that would be used is found in [RFC5920].

   However, the use of scheduled LSPs extends the attack surface for a
   PCE-enabled TE system by providing a larger (logically infinte)
   window during which an attack can be initiated or planned.  That is,
   if bogus scheduled LSPs can be requested, they can be entered into
   the LSP-DB, then a large number of LSPs could be launched, or
   significant network resources could be blocked.  Of course,
   additional authorization could be applied for access to LSP
   scheduling, and diagnostic tools could inspect the LSP DB to spot
   attacks.
