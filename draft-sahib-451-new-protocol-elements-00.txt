             New protocol elements for HTTP Status Code 451
                draft-sahib-451-new-protocol-elements-00

Abstract

   This draft recommends protocol updates to Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) status code 451 (defined by RFC7725) based on an examination
   of how the new status code is being used by parties involved in
   denial of Internet resources because of legal demands.  Also included
   is an analysis of HTTP 451 from a human rights perspective using
   guidelines from RFC8280.

   Discussion of this draft is at https://www.irtf.org/mailman/listinfo/
   hrpc and https://lists.ghserv.net/mailman/listinfo/statuscode451.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7725] was standardized by the IETF in February 2016.  It defined
   HTTP status code 451 - to be used when a "a server operator has
   received a legal demand to deny access to a resource or to a set of
   resources".

   Subsequently, an effort was made to investigate usage of HTTP 451 and
   evaluate if it fulfills its mandate of providing "transparency in
   circumstances where issues of law or public policy affect server
   operations" [IMPL_REPORT_DRAFT].  This draft attempts to explicate
   the protocol recommendations arising out of that investigation.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Existing Protocol Elements

   The status code as standardized by the IETF specifies the following
   elements [RFC7725] -

   -  A server can return status code 451 to indicate that it is denying
      access to a resource or multiple resources on account of a legal
      demand.

   -  Responses using the status code SHOULD include an explanation in
      the response body of the details of the legal demand.

   -  Responses SHOULD include a "Link" HTTP header field [RFC8288]
      whose value is a URI reference [RFC3986] identifying itself.  The
      "Link" header field MUST have a "rel" parameter whose value is
      "blocked-by".  The intent is that the header be used to identify
      the entity actually implementing blockage, not any other entity
      mandating it.

4.  Recommendations

   -  In addition to the "blocked-by" header, an HTTP response with
      status code 451 SHOULD include another "Link" HTTP header field
      which has a "rel" parameter whose value is "blocking-authority".
      It's important to distinguish between the implementer of the
      block, and the authority that mandated the block in the first
      place.  This is because these two organizations might not be the
      same - a government (the blocking authority) could force an
      Internet Service Provider (the implementer of the block) to deny
      access to a certain resource.  [IMPL_REPORT_DRAFT] notes that
      there is confusion amongst implementors of [RFC7725] about the
      meaning of the term "blocked-by", perhaps in part because of the
      example given [ERRATA_ID-5181] - it would be useful to explicitly
      include space for both, as both provide essential information
      about the legal block.

   -  HTTP status code 451 is increasingly being used to deny access to
      resources based on geographical IP.  The response SHOULD contain a
      provisional header with geographical scope of block.  This scope
      SHOULD correspond to alpha-2 country code defined in [ISO.3166-1].
      The rationale for keeping the geographical scope to country-level
      granularity is that most blocks are mandated by national

      governments [IMPL_REPORT_DRAFT].  In addition, as the serving of
      this status code is voluntary, there is value in not complicating
      the specification.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add additional security considerations to
   [RFC7725].

6.  IANA Considerations

   The Link Relation Type Registry should be updated with the following
   entry:

   -  Relation Name: blocking-authority

   -  Description: Identifies the authority that has issued the block.

   -  Reference: this document

   In addition, IANA should be updated with the following provisional
   header:

   -  Header field name: geo-scope-block

   -  Applicable protocol: http

   -  Status: provisional

   -  Specification document(s): this document

7.  Human Rights Considerations

   The use of HTTP 451 has implications for human rights, and is thus
   worth examining under the guidelines for developing human rights
   considerations for protocols [RFC8280].

7.1.  Connectivity

   HTTP 451 status code response can be sent by the server hosting the
   blocked resource (end node) or an intermediary node that implements
   the block.  If a resource is "blocked-by" a particular ISP then the
   ISP will be the one serving the status code.

7.2.  Privacy

   HTTP 451 is used as a response when the client requests a resource
   that's unavailable because of legal reasons.  Consequentially, there
   are potential privacy (and anonymity) ramifications if there is
   leakage of who accessed what resource.

   HTTP status code 451 is cacheable by default [RFC7725].  Caching
   status code 451 on users' devices means that there will be a record
   of their attempt to access the blocked content stored on their
   devices.  If caching is used, the software used to access the web
   resource should notify users that the HTTP 451 response has been
   received and cached.

7.3.  Content Agnosticism

   The scope of the blocking order may be geographical in nature.  This
   results in an issue related to content agnosticism.  This is not a
   protocol issue, but rather an artefact of the blocking order.

7.4.  Security

   Refer to section 5, Security Considerations, of [RFC7725].

7.5.  Internationalization

   [RFC7725] does not require the use of any particular language for
   user-facing strings such as the response body or the value of the
   header fields.  The header field names, however, are in English.
   This is a common attribute of protocol elements within the IETF
   [RFC2277].

7.6.  Censorship Resistance

   While HTTP 451 status code cannot prevent censorship, it can help
   make censorship more transparent and make assessment of Internet
   censorship cases easier by providing information about the block in a
   parseable manner.

7.7.  Open Standards

   [RFC7725] is an open standard.

7.8.  Heterogeneity Support

   An HTTP 451 status code response can be used for any web resource and
   for any software that is capable of understanding HTTP header
   responses.

Internet-Draft          New elements for HTTP 451             March 2018


7.9.  Anonymity

   HTTP 451 is an HTTP status code.  If the connection between the
   client and the server is not over HTTPS, then there is potential for
   a network observer to identify what a particular user is accessing.
   Even with HTTPS, meta-data might be available that could be used to
   identify a user.

7.10.  Pseudonymity

   HTTP 451 does not involve pseudonyms or nicknames.

7.11.  Accessibility

   HTTP 451, being an HTTP status code, does not prescribe how the
   client should parse the information contained in the response fields.
   Depending on the software that is used to access the resource, there
   could be accessibility concerns related to understanding this
   information.

7.12.  Localization

   The values of the header fields and the response body can be
   localized by the blocker to suit the geographical scope of the block.

7.13.  Decentralization

   HTTP 451 is used to provide information about a block mandated by a
   (centralized) blocking authority.  The status code itself does not
   add any additional centralization.

7.14.  Reliability

   HTTP 451 does not by itself prevent the misuse of the status code or
   wrong tagging of resources.  The informational requirement as part of
   the protocol address this concern to some extent, but commonly it
   will be difficult for the end user to verify if the code has been
   correctly used.  Objective of this draft is to increase reliability
   by making it clearer what a good HTTP 451 response looks like.

7.15.  Confidentiality

   HTTP 451 status code use implies sharing of information by the
   reporter that make it easier to identify where censorship is taking
   place.  See section on Privacy and Anonymity.

Internet-Draft          New elements for HTTP 451             March 2018


7.16.  Integrity

   HTTP 451 does not prescribe the use of any encryption to transport
   it, and is thus susceptible to leakage through man-in-the-middle
   attacks.

7.17.  Authenticity

   Authenticity of the server implementing HTTP 451 is dependent on the
   connection being over HTTPS.

7.18.  Adaptability

   HTTP 451 does not have any legal or technical limitations which
   prevents the development of other standards / protocols.

7.19.  Outcome Transparency

   The assumption behind the development of the status code 451 is that
   transparency has a chilling effect on censorship and that
   transparency will enable the process of justice by allowing acts of
   censorship to be challenged.  In some countries, blocks orders are
   unevenly implemented by ISPs either because it does not serve their
   bottom-lines or they are resisting censorship - governments in those
   countries could mandate the implementation of status code 451 which
   will make it easier for them to monitor the implementation of their
   block orders.  Surveillance systems in some countries could be
   updated to watch out for the 451 error code on unencrypted traffic
   making it easier to identify those trying to access prohibited
   content.  Before the implementation of this standard there would be
   no uniformity in which websites would implement a block order
   increasing the number of false positives for any automated monitoring
   systems.
