Abstract

   Some of the user equipment's Application Information are valuable to
   be shown by the Presence Service.  The typical Application
   Information is what song the presentity is listening to.  The
   Application Information for the Presence Information Data Format
   (AIPID) is an extension that adds elements to the Presence
   Information Data Format (PIDF) that provide additional Application
   Information about a presentity.

1.  Introduction

   Presence Service is useful to let a user share his/her information to
   his/her friends.  Some of these information is application-specific.
   For example, when a user is listening to a pop music and he/she wants
   to let his/her friends know that he/she is enjoying that music now,
   he/she can set his/her presence client to catch the music information
   from his media player or let his media player submit such information
   to the presence client.  This specification describes a typical set
   of application information elements that allow a watcher to retrieve
   such information about a presentity.

   All elements extend the <person> in the presence data model [2].
   They provide some typical application information related to the
   music, video, game or website the presentity's application program is
   processing.  All these elements are optional.

3.  AIPID Elements

3.1.  Music Element

   The <listening> element includes a child element <title> indicating
   the name of the music the presentity is listening to.  The <resource>
   child-element provides a URI to let watchers know where they can
   download this music.  The presentity or the application can submit
   some remarks to this music by using the <note> child-element.

3.2.  Website Element

   The <surfing> element includes a child element <title> indicating the
   name of the website the presentity is surfing.  The <resource> child-
   element provides a URI to let watchers know how to access this
   website.  The presentity or the application can submit some remarks
   to this website by using the <note> child-element.

3.3.  Video Element

   The <watching> element includes a child element <title> indicating
   the name of the video the presentity is watching.  The <resource>
   child-element provides a URI to let watchers know where they can
   download this video.  The presentity or the application can submit
   some remarks to this video by using the <note> child-element.

3.4.  Game Element

   The <gaming> element includes a child element <title> indicating the
   name of the game the presentity is playing.  The <resource> child-
   element provides an official website to let watchers know where they
   can begin to play the game.  The presentity or the application can
   submit some remarks to this game by using the <note> child-element.
