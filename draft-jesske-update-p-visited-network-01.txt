     Update to Private Header Field P-Visited-Network-ID in Session
            Initiation Protocol (SIP) Requests and Responses
              draft-jesske-update-p-visited-network-01.txt

Abstract

   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has identified cases
   where the private header field P-Visited-Network-ID SIP private
   header extensions, which is defined in RFC 7315 and updated by RFC
   7976, needs to be included in SIP requests and responses.  This
   document updates RFC 7976, in order to allow inclusion of the P-
   Visited-Network-ID header field in responses.

1.  Introduction

   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has identified cases
   where different Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] private
   header extensions referred to as "P-" header fields, and defined in
   [RFC7315], need to be included in SIP requests and responses which is
   currently not allowed according to [RFC7315].  This document updates
   [RFC7315], to allow the inclusion of the affected "P-" header fields
   in such requests and responses.  This document also makes updates for
   [RFC7976] to fix misalignments that occurred when [RFC7315] was
   updated for specific "P-" header fields which are mainly used in (and
   in most cases, only defined for) networks defined by the 3GPP.  The
   updates defined in this document will not cause backward-
   compatibility problems in 3GPP networks which are using
   [TS.3GPP.24.229].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Applicability of P-Visited-Network-ID in responses

   In [RFC7976] section 3.  "Updates to RFC 7315" the P-Visited-Network-
   ID header field was restricted to the following: The P-Visited-
   Network-ID header field can appear in all SIP methods except ACK,
   BYE, CANCEL, NOTIFY, PRACK, INFO, and UPDATE.  This document allows
   the use of the P-Visited-Network-ID header field additionally within
   Responses as follows: Any SIP Response message, except for a 100
   (Trying), MAY contain a P-Visited-Network-ID header field.  The P-

   Visited-Network-ID header field is not needed in the 100 (Trying)
   responses, since they are transmitted hop by hop, not end to end.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for these "P-" header fields are defined
   in [RFC7315].  This specification allows some header fields to be
   present in messages where they were previously not allowed, and the
   security considerations and assumptions described in [RFC7315] (e.g.,
   regarding only sending information to trusted entities) also apply to
   those messages.  That does not cause any security issues, but
   implementors need to be aware that implementations may not have been
   updated according to this document, and take proper actions if a
   header field does not occur, in a message where it should occur or
   occurs in a message where it should not occur.  The security and
   privacy considerations for the P-Visited-Network-ID header field are
   similar to those for the other SIP responses discussed in [RFC7315].
