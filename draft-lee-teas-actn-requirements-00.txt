            . threshold of traffic monitoring (e.g., high and low
               threshold), etc.

3.1. Two categories of requirements

   This section provides a summary of use-cases in terms of two
   categories: (i) service-specific requirements; (ii) network-related
   requirements.

   Service-specific requirements listed below are uniquely applied to
   the work scope of ACTN. Service-specific requirements are related to
   virtual service coordination function defined in Section 3. These
   requirements are related to customer's VNs in terms of service
   policy associated with VNs such as service performance objectives,
   VN endpoint location information for certain required service-
   specific functions (e.g., security and others), VN survivability
   requirement, or dynamic service control policy, etc.

   Network-related requirements are related to virtual network
   operation function defined in Section 3. These requirements are
   related to multi-domain and multi-layer signaling, routing,
   protection/restoration and synergy, re-optimization/re-grooming,
   etc. These requirements are not inherently unique for the scope of
   ACTN but some of these requirements are in scope of ACTN, especially
   for coherent/seamless operation aspect of multiple controller
   hierarchy.

   The following table gives an overview of service-specific
   requirements and network-related requirements respectively for each
   ACTN use-case and identifies the work in scope of ACTN.

   Figure 1 shows how VN service policies from the CNC are incorporated
   by the MDSC to support multi-destination applications. Multi-
   destination applications refer to applications in which the
   selection of the destination of a network path for a given source
   needs to be decided dynamically to support such applications.

   Data Center selection problems arise for VM mobility, disaster
   recovery and load balancing cases. VN's service policy plays an
   important role for virtual network operation. Service policy can be
   static or dynamic. Dynamic service policy for data center selection
   may be placed as a result of utilization of data center resources
   supporting VNs. The MSDC would then incorporate this information to
   meet the service objective of this application.

   This scenario is similar to the previous case in that the VN service
   policy for the application can be met by a set of multiple
   destinations that provide the required virtual network functions
   (VNF). Virtual network functions can be, for example, security
   functions required by the VN application. The VN service policy by
   the CNC would indicate the locations of a certain VNF that can be
   fulfilled. This policy information is critical in finding the
   optimal network path subject to this constraint. As VNFs can be
   dynamically moved across different DCs, this policy should be
   dynamically enforced from the CNC to the MDSC and the PNCs.

   Figure 3 shows the flow of dynamic service control policy
   enforcement for performance and fault management initiated by
   customer per their VN. The feedback loop and filtering mechanism
   tailored for VNs performed by the MDSC differentiates this ACTN
   scope from traditional network management paradigm. VN level dynamic
   OAM data model is a building block to support this capability.

      Figure 4: E2E VN Survivability and Multi-layer Coordination for
                        Protection and Restoration

   Figure 4 shows the need for E2E protection/restoration control
   coordination that involves CNC, MDSC and PNCs to meet the VN
   survivability requirement. VN survivability requirement and its
   policy need to be translated into multi-domain and multi-layer
   network protection and restoration scenarios across different
   controller types. After an E2E path is setup successfully, the MSDC
   has a unique role to enforce policy-based flexible VN survivability
   requirement by coordinating all PNC domains.

   As seen in Figure 4, multi-layer (i.e., packet/optical) coordination
   is a subset of this E2E protection/restoration control operation.
   The MDSC has a role to play in determining an optimal
   protection/restoration level based on the customer's VN
   survivability requirement. For instance, the MDSC needs to interface
   the PNC for packet core as well as the PNC for optical core and
   enforce protection/restoration policy as part of the E2E
   protection/restoration. Neither the PNC for packet core nor the PNC
   for optical core is in a position to be aware of the E2E path and
   its protection/restoration situation. This role of the MSDC is
   unique for this reason. In some cases, the MDSC will have to
   determine and enforce optical bypass to find a feasible reroute path
   upon packet core network failure which cannot be resolved the packet
   core network itself.

   To coordinate this operation, the PNCs will need to update its
   domain level abstract topology upon resource changes due to a
   network failure or other factors. The MSDC will incorporate all
   these update to determine if an alternate E2E reroute path is
   necessary or not based on the changes reported from the PNCs. It
   will need to update the E2E abstract topology and the affected CN's
   VN topology in real-time. This refers to dynamic synchronization of
   topology from Physical topology to abstract topology to VN topology.

   MDSC will also need to perform the path restoration signaling to the
   affected PNCs whenever necessary.

          path
        o PNC will confirm to MDSC if it finds its domain path
   7. Path Restoration Operation (after an E2E path is setup
     successfully, some domain had a failure that cannot be
     restored by the PNC domain)
   - The problem PNC will send this notification with changed
     abstract topology (computed after resource changes due to
     failure/other factors)
   - MDSC will find an alternate E2E path based on the changes
     reported from PNC. It will need to update the E2E abstract
     topology and the affected CN's VN topology in real-time (This
     refers to dynamic synchronization of topology from Physical
     topology to abstract topology to VN topology)
   - MDSC will perform the path restoration signaling to the
     affected PNCs.
   8. Coordination of Multi-destination service restoration
     operation (CNC have, for example, multiple endpoints where the
     source endpoint can send its data to either one of the
     endpoints)
   - When PNC reports domain problem that cannot be resolved at
     MDSC level because of there is no network restoration path to
     a given destination.
   - Then MDSC has Customers' profile in which to find the customer
     has "multi-destination" application.
   - Under policy A, MDSC will be allowed to reroute the customer
     traffic to one of the pre-negotiated destinations and proceed
     with restoration of this particular customer's traffic.
   - Under policy B, CNC may reroute on its VN topology level and
     push this to MDSC and MDSC maps this into its abstract
     topology and proceed with restoration of this customer's
     traffic.
   - In either case, the MDSC will proceed its restoration
     operation (as explained in Req. 6) to the corresponding PNCs.

   9. MDSC-PNC policy negotiation is also needed as to how
     restoration is done across MDSC and PNCs.

   10.   Generic Abstract Topology Update per changes due to new
     path setup/connection failure/degradation/restoration
   11.   Service-specific Abstract Topology Update per changes due
     to new path setup/connection failure/degradation/restoration
   12.   Abstraction model of technology-specific topology element
