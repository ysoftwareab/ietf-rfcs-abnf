Abstract

   This memo registers the Enumservice "vCard" with several subtypes
   according to the IANA Enumservice registration process described in
   RFC3671.  This Enumservice is to be used to refer from an ENUM domain
   name to a vCard instance describing the user of the respective E.164
   number.

   Information gathered from those vCards could be used before, during

   or after inbound or outbound communication takes place.  For example,
   a callee might be presented with the name and association of the
   caller before picking up the call.

2.  Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [5].

   E.164 number mapping (ENUM) [1] uses the Domain Name System (DNS) [3]
   for mapping E.164 numbers [7] to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
   [4].  E.164 numbers are converted to ENUM domain names through means
   described further in RFC 3761.  The registration process for
   Enumservices is also described there.

   "vCard" [2] is a transport independent data format for the exchange
   of information about an individual.  For the purpose of this
   document, the term "vCard" refers to a specific instance of this data
   format - an "electronic business card". vCards are exchanged via
   several protocols, most commonly they are distributed as electronic
   mail attachments or published on web servers.  Most popular personal
   information manager applications are capable of reading and writing
   vCards.

   The Enumservice specified in this document deals with the relation
   between an E.164 number and vCards.  Depending on the subtype of the
   Enumservice, it either identifies a resource containing a vCard which
   can be fetched ("pull" mode), or a resource where vCards can be
   delivered to ("push" mode).

3.1.  "Plain" Subtype ("pull" mode)

Internet-Draft              vCard Enumservice              November 2005


   Enumservice Type: "vcard"

   Enumservice Subtype: "plain"

   URI Schemes: "http", "https"

   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is a plain
      vCard according to RFC 2426.  Clients may attempt to fetch the
      vCard from the resource indicated, but should expect access to be
      restricted.

   Security Considerations: see Section 5

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Authors: David Lindner, Alexander Mayrhofer (see 'Authors' section
   for contact details)

3.2.  "RDF" Subtype ("pull" mode)

   Enumservice Name: "vCard"

   Enumservice Type: "vcard"

   Enumservice Subtype: "rdf"

   URI Schemes: "http", "https"

   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is a RDF-
      formatted vCard according to section 3 - 5 of W3C vcard-rdf [6].
      Clients may attempt to fetch the vCard from the resource
      indicated, but should expect access to be restricted.

   Security Considerations: see Section 5

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Authors: David Lindner, Alexander Mayrhofer (see 'Authors' section
   for contact details)

   Enumservice Subtype: "xml"

   URI Schemes: "http", "https"

   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is a XML-
      formatted vCard according to section 6 of W3C vcard-rdf [6].
      Clients may attempt to fetch the vCard from the resource
      indicated, but should expect access to be restricted.

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Authors: David Lindner, Alexander Mayrhofer (see 'Authors' section
   for contact details)

3.4.  "Sink" Subtype ("push" mode)

   Enumservice Name: "vCard"

   Enumservice Type: "vcard"

   Enumservice Subtype: "sink"

   URI Schemes: "mailto"

   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservices indicates that the resource identified is an
      email address where vCards destined to the owner of the respective
      ENUM domain should be delivered to.  Clients should deliver vCards
      to this email address instead of the user's generic email address
      indicated by other Enumservices.  However, they should assume that
      messages to this email address are not read by the user, but
      rather processed automatically by an address book application.

   Security Considerations: see Section 5

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Authors: David Lindner, Alexander Mayrhofer (see 'Authors' section
   for contact details)


4.  Example

   An example ENUM entry referencing to a plain vCard could look like:

      @ IN NAPTR 100 10 "u" "E2U+vcard:plain"
      "!^.*$!http://www.enum.at/vcard-axelm.vcf!" .


5.  Security & Privacy Considerations

5.1.  The Record Itself

   Since ENUM uses DNS - a publicly available database - any information
   contained in records provisioned in ENUM domains must be considered
   public as well.  Even after revoking the DNS entry and removing the
   refered resource, copies of the information could still be available.

   Information published in ENUM records could reveal associations
   between E.164 numbers and their owners - especially if records
   contain personal identifiers or domain names for which ownership
   information can easily be obtained.

   However, it is important to note that the ENUM record itself does not
   need to contain any personal information.  It just points to a
   location where access to personal information could be granted.

   ENUM records pointing to third party resources can easily be
   provisioned on purpose by the ENUM domain owner - so any assumption
   about the association between a number and an entity could therefore
   be completely bogus unless some kind of identity verification is in
   place.  This verification is out of scope for this memo.

5.2.  The Resource Identified

   Users SHOULD carefully consider information they provide in the
   resource identified by the ENUM record.  Considerations SHOULD
   include serving information only to entities of the user's choice
   and/or limiting the comprehension of the information provided based
   on the requesting entity.

   On the other hand, most of the information which a vCard would
   typically contain is already available via more "traditional" sources
   like white pages and online directories.  Therefore, publishing a
   vCard on the internet and associating it to a phone number does not
   increase the amount of available information at all if the
   information was already public before.

   If access restrictions are deployed, Standard HTTP mechanisms MUST be
   used to enforce those restrictions.  HTTPS SHOULD be preferred if the
   deployed mechanisms are prone to eavesdropping and replay attacks.
