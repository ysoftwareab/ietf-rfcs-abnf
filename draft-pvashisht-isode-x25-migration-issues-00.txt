Abstract

   ISODE (International Standard Organization Development Environment) 
   is one of the most mature implementation of the ISO (International 
   Standard Organization) protocol stack. The majority of the ISODE 
   implementation work over TCP. This draft presents some of the 
   possible issues that MAY arise while porting the ISODE protocol 
   stack over X.25.

Internet-Draft      Issues in Migrating ISODE to X.25          May 2006


1.  Introduction

   ISODE is an implementation of ISO protocol stacks. It implements the
   various ISO layer protocols, namely, Transport layer, Session layer,
   Presentation Layer and Application layer. The transport layer could
   run on various network layers but the most commonly used ones are
   TCP/IP (refer RFC 1006) and X.25. ISODE has primarily a very good
   support to run the protocol stack over TCP/IP. This has been 
   facilitated by the fact that TCP/IP has a very wide acceptance and 
   over the last few decades, it has become the de-facto standard. 
   
   Though ISODE does provide the framework to support the X.25 as the 
   underlying network layer but still it may require some level of 
   effort to migrate to X.25 seamlessly. 
   
   This draft addresses the issues that may arise when a vendor 
   attempts to port the ISODE stack over X.25.

   

2.  Motivation

   The figure below presents a brief overview of the ISODE protocol
   stack.

   Though TCP/IP based ISODE implementation are quite common but it
   may happen that a vendor might be required to provide a X.25
   based ISODE implementation depending upon the requirement of 
   the customer (who may be supporting a legacy X.25 network).
   Such a requirement would necessitate the need for porting the
   ISODE protocol stack over the X.25.

Internet-Draft      Issues in Migrating ISODE to X.25          May 2006



   The ISODE designers were generous enough to provide a framework for
   facilitating the migration of ISODE over X.25 but still there
   could be issues in the porting, which are triggered by the 
   implementation of the X.25 layer and the interface it exposes
   to the ISO transport layer. In this draft, we address several
   such issues and possible mechanism to resolve them.
   


3.  Applicability

   The issues mentioned in this draft shall apply to more or less all
   the implementations of ISODE (version 8 or later), which need to be
   migrated from TCP/IP to X.25

   The issues mentioned in successive sections shall be applicable to
   any network service provider or service implementer, who wants to 
   provide support for X.25 layer under ISODE.

 
   

4.  Migration Issues
   
   This section presents the various issues that may need to be 
   addressed when porting ISODE from TCP/IP to ISODE.


4.1 Support from X.25 card driver

   TCP/IP is presently used in all kinds of networks and the support
   for the same is already present in majority of the operating 
   systems. For X.25 the major source of support is from the X.25
   driver for the X.25 card hardware. The way the X.25 card is
   programmed has a lot to do with the overall porting complexity.
  
   The kind of buffering mechanism used in the driver, the performance 
   of the overall ISODE implementation could also be impacted. 
   Similarly, the interface with the driver (polled or interrupt 
   based) could also impact the overall functionality. The best way
   should be to benchmark the functionality based on individual 
   requirements, taking into account the CPU load utilization, 
   buffering constraints, and interrupt latency.

4.2 Socket abstraction layer

   The existing ISODE implementation relies heavily on the sockets.
   The socket descriptors are also used as session (or association)
   descriptors across various upper layers. Therefore, it makes 
   sense to continue to exploit the existing mechanism to the 
   maximum extent possible.

   This shall require implementation of an interface layer between
   the ISO transport layer and the X.25 network layer. This layer
   shall provide the socket abstraction to the ISO transport layer.

   Though some of the operating systems do provide the support for
   X.25 based sockets but the actual needs to be verified with 
   respect to the support for the X.25 card that a vendor may be 
   using.

   In either case, a socket based abstraction layer could solve a
   lot of overheard in the porting exercise.

   This shall provide additional benefit of the continual use of the
   "select" call, which works mainly with socket descriptors. Many 
   of the ISODE based applications rely on the "select" call to 
   multiplex among the various simultaneous connections ( also 
   referred to as associations).

   Though the implementers are free to implement any other interface
   scheme but it may complicate the overall integration of the ISODE
   protocol stack with the underlying X.25 layers.



4.3 ISO Transport layer requirements

   There are various kinds of ISO transport layers available (ranging
   from TP0 to TP4), which differ in the number of transport layer
   facilities provided by them. The simplest one is TP0, which provides
   the basic transport layer functionality and segmentation and 
   reassembly.

   
   For TCP/IP based ISODE implementation, it was quite easy to 
   multiplex multiple ISO transport over a single TCP connection.
   But in case of X.25 based implementation, this shall require some 
   tweaking at the ISO transport layer and also at the socket 
   abstraction layer (section 4.2).

Internet-Draft      Issues in Migrating ISODE to X.25          May 2006


   This is largely dictated by the requirement of the upper layer 
   (e.g. an upper layer may want to establish multiple transport 
   connections over a single X.25 virtual circuit for cost saving). 

   Such a requirement would require modifications to the ISODE 
   transport layer to provide support for the mapping of multiple 
   transport layer connections to a single network connection 
   (as required to support TP2). 

   Similarly, other modifications may be required to the ISODE 
   transport layer to support other features (e.g. Error recovery).



4.4 Implementation specific issues

   There could be some other issues (as outlined below), which have 
   more to do with the specifics of the implementation rather than 
   the protocol.

   Depending upon whether the ISODE protocol stack is used in a 
   thread-safe environment or not, the implementer may be required 
   to provide additional mechanism to ensure the thread safety of 
   the ISODE protocol stack.

   The X.25 layer may be seamlessly integrated with ISODE (which is
   running in the user space) OR it may be possible that the X.25 
   card driver is a part of the operating system kernel. In the 
   latter scenario, the implementer may have to implement mechanism 
   for communication between the ISODE transport layer and the X.25 
   network layer.

   Unlike TCP, where the user could get the information about the 
   disconnection of underlying network connection easily, it might 
   be a bit challenging task to get such an information from the 
   X.25 network layer asynchronously. Though, there may be 
   implementations which could provide such a support but more often 
   than not, such a mechanism might be required to be built upon the 
   underlying X.25 layer.


4.5 Performance Issue

   The TCP/IP is mostly implemented in the operating system kernel 
   and is known to operate on all kinds of media. Most common 
   implementation seen these days start from 10/100 Base-T. Whereas, 
   the X.25 is mostly used for slower networks and is present today 
   mostly because of the legacy reasons.

   Therefore, it shall not be wise to compare the performance of ISODE
   implementations over TCP/IP with that of ISODE implementation over 
   X.25. Still, it is imperative to optimize the performance of a X.25
   based ISODE implementation by taking support from the underlying 
   hardware (e.g. increasing the number of buffers in the X.25 driver,
   tweaking the polling interval, maximizing the queue sizes etc.)

5.3.  Security Considerations

   This memo raises no security issues. It is believed that any 
   security mechanisms shall be implemented at the appropriate 
   layer (as required). The transport layer as discussed in this
   memo doesn't provide any security mechanisms.
