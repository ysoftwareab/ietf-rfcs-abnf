1.  Introduction

   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] protocol
   operates by transmitting and receiving control frames, generally at
   high frequency, over the datapath being monitored.  In order to
   prevent significant data loss due to a datapath failure, the
   tolerance for lost or delayed frames in the Detection Time, as
   defined in BFD [RFC5880] is set to the smallest feasible value.

   This document proposes a mechanism to detect lost frames in a BFD
   session in addition to the datapath fault detection mechanisms of
   BFD.  Such a mechanism presents significant value to measure the
   stability of BFD sessions and provides data to the operators for the
   cause of a BFD failure.

   This document does not propose BFD extension to measure data traffic
   loss or delay on a link or tunnel and the scope is limited to BFD
   frames.

2.  Use Cases

   Legacy BFD cannot detect any BFD frame loss if loss does not last for
   dead interval.  This draft proposes a method to detect a dropped
   frame on the receiver.  For example, if the receiver receives BFD CC
   frame k at time t but receives frame k+3 at time t+10ms, and never
   receives frame k+1 and/or k+2, then it has experienced a drop.

   This proposal enables BFD engine to generate diagnostic information
   on the health of each BFD session that could be used to preempt a
   failure on a link that BFD was monitoring by allowing time for a
   corrective action to be taken.

   In a faulty datapath scenario, operator can use BFD health
   information to trigger delay and loss measurement OAM protocol
   (Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) or Loss Measurement (LM)-Delay
   Measurement (DM)) to further isolate the issue.

3.  BFD Null-Authentication TLV

   The functionality proposed for BFD stability measurement is achieved
   by appending the Null-Authentication TLV (as defined in Optimizing
   BFD Authentication [I-D.ietf-bfd-optimizing-authentication] ) to the
   BFD control frame that do not have authentication enabled.

4.  Theory of Operations

   This mechanism allows operator to measure the loss of BFD CC frames.

   When using MD5 or SHA authentication, BFD uses authentication TLV
   that carries the Sequence Number.  However, if non-meticulous
   authentication is being used, or no authentication is in use, then
   the non-authenticated BFD frames MUST include NULL-Auth TLV.

4.1.  Loss Measurement

   Loss measurement counts the number of BFD control frames missed at
   the receiver during any Detection Time period.  The loss is detected
   by comparing the Sequence Number field in the Auth TLV (NULL or
   otherwise) in successive BFD CC frames.  The Sequence Number in each
   successive control frame generated on a BFD session by the
   transmitter is incremented by one.

   The first BFD NULL-Auth TLV processed by the receiver that has a non-
   zero sequence number is used for bootstrapping the logic.  Each
   successive frame after this is expected to have a Sequence Number
   that is one greater than the Sequence Number in the previous frame.

   When the Sequence Number wraps around it should start from 1 instead
   of 0.

5.  IANA Requirements

   N/A

6.  Security Consideration

   Other than concerns raised in BFD [RFC5880] there are no new concerns
   with this proposal.
