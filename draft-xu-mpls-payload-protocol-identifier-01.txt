                    MPLS Payload Protocol Identifier
              draft-xu-mpls-payload-protocol-identifier-01

Abstract

   The MPLS label stack has no explicit protocol identifier field to
   indicate the protocol type of the MPLS payload.  This document
   proposes a mechanism for containing a protocol identifier field
   within the MPLS packet, which is useful for any new encapsulation
   header which may need to be encapsulated with an MPLS header.

1.  Introduction

   The MPLS label stack has no explicit protocol identifier field to
   indicate the protocol type of the MPLS payload.  This document
   proposes a mechanism for containing a protocol identifier field
   within the MPLS packet, which is useful for any new encapsulation
   header which may need to be encapsulated with an MPLS header.  With
   this explicit protocol identifier field, there is no need any more
   for each new encapsulation header to deal with the notorious first
   nibble issue associated with MPLS individually.  More specifically,
   there is no need to intentionally avoid the first nibble of each new
   encapsulation header from being 0100 (IPv4) or 0110 (IPv6).

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC3032].

3.  Protocol Type Field

   The encapsulation format for Protocol Type field is depicted as
   below:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                 PIL                   | EXP |1|      TTL      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |0 0 0 0|       Reserved          |        Protocol Type        |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                              Payload                          |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Protocol Identifier Label (PIL): This field contains a special
      purpose label with value of <TBD> or an extended special purpose
      label [RFC7274] with value of <TBD> which indicates that a
      Protocol Type field appears immediately after the bottom of the
      label stack.

      EXP: The usage of this field is in accordance with the current
      MPLS specification [RFC3032].

      S: The Bottom of Stack (BoS) field is set since the PIL MUST
      always appear at the bottom of the label stack.

      TTL: The usage of this field is in accordance with the current
      MPLS specification [RFC3032].  Reserved MUST be set to 0 and
      ignored on reception.

      Protocol Type: This field indicates the protocol type of the MPLS
      payload as per [ETYPES].

      Payload: This field contains the MPLS payload which can be an IP
      packet, an Ethernet frame, or any other type of payload (e.g.,
      network service header).

4.1.  Egress LSRs

   Suppose egress LSR Y is capable of processing the Protocol Type field
   contained in MPLS packets.  LSR Y indicates this to all ingress LSRs
   via signaling (see Section 5).  LSR Y MUST be prepared to deal with
   both packets with an imposed Protocol Type field and those without;
   the PIL will distinguish these cases.  If a particular ingress LSR
   chooses not to impose a Protocol Type field, LSR Y's processing of
   the received label stack (which might be empty) is as if LSR Y chose
   not to accept Protocol Type field.  If an ingress LSR X chooses to
   impose the Protocol Type field, then LSR Y will receive an MPLS
   packet constructed as follows: <Top Label (TL), Application Label
   (AL), PIL> <Protocol Type field> <remaining MPLS payload>.  Note that
   here the TL could be replaced with an IP-based tunnel [RFC4023] and
   the AL is optional.  LSR Y recognizes TL as the label it distributed
   to its upstream LSR and pops the TL (note that the TL may be an
   implicit null label, in which case it doesn't appear in the label
   stack and LSR Y MUST process the packet starting with the AL label
   (if present) and/or the PIL.)  LSR Y recognizes the PIL with S bit
   set.  LSR Y then processes the Protocol Type field, which will
   determine how LSR Y processes the MPLS payload.

4.2.  Ingress LSRs

   If an egress LSR Y indicates via signaling that it can process the
   Protocol Type field, an ingress LSR X can choose whether or not to
   insert it into the MPLS packet destined for LSR Y.  The ingress LSR X
   MUST NOT insert the Protocol Type field into that MPLS packet unless
   the egress LSR X has explicitly announced that it could process it.
   The steps that ingress LSR X performs to insert the Protocol Type
   field are as follows:

   1.  On an incoming packet, identify the application to which the
       packet belongs and determine whether the Protocol Type field
       needs to be added to the incoming packet.

   2.  For packets requiring the insertion of the Protocol Type field,
       prepend the Protocol Type field to the existing MPLS payload;
       then, push the PIL on to the label stack with the S bit set.

   3.  Push the application label (AL) label (if required) on to the
       label stack.

   4.  Push the EL and the ELI labels [RFC6790] on to the label stack
       (if required).

   5.  Determine the top label (TL) and push it on to the label stack.

   6.  Determine the output interface and send the packet out.

4.3.  Transit LSRs

   Transit LSRs MAY operate with no change in forwarding behavior.  If a
   transit LSR recognizes the PIL and the subsequent Protocol Type
   field, it MAY be allowed to do some additional value-added
   processing, such as MPLS payload inspection, on the received MPLS
   packet containing the PIL and the Protocol Type field.

4.4.  4.4.  Penultimate Hop LSRs

   No change is needed at penultimate hop LSRs.

5.  5.  Signaling for PIL Processing Capability

5.1.  LDP

   TBD

5.2.  RSVP-TE

   TBD

5.3.  BGP

   TBD

5.4.  ISIS

   TBD

5.5.  OSPF

   TBD

6.  IANA Considerations

   A special purpose label with value of <TBD> or an extended special
   purpose label with value of <TBD> for the PIL needs to be assigned by
   the IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD
