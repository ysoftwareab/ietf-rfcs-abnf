1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

2.  Introduction

   The NSIS working group is standardizing a signaling protocol suite
   with QoS signaling as the first use case.  The overall signaling
   protocol suite is decomposed into a generic lower layer with separate
   upper layers for signaling applications.  The upper layer protocol,
   called NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP), has an end-to-end scope
   and contains application specific functionality.  QoS-NSLP [2] which
   is an NSLP for QoS Signaling defines message types and control
   information generic to all QoS models (QOSMs).  A QOSM is a defined
   mechanism for achieving QoS as a whole.  The specification of a QOSM
   includes a description of its QSPEC parameter information and how
   that information should be treated or interpreted in the network.

   The QSPEC contains a set of parameters and values describing the
   requested resources [3].  The QSPEC object also contains control
   information and the QoS parameters defined by the QOSM.  A QOSM
   provides a specific set of parameters to be carried in the QSPEC.  At
   each QoS NSIS Entity (QNE), its contents are interpreted by the
   resource management function (RMF) for policy control and traffic
   control (including admission control and configuration of the packet
   classifier and scheduler).

   Figure 1 shows a network environment where there are multiple
   different QOSMs [3].  One of the representative XG QOSMs shown in the
   figure could be 3GPP QOSM.

Internet-Draft               3GPP QoS Model                     May 2005


   QoS interworking between 3GPP wireless and non-3GPP wireline networks
   will be essential if future IP-based next generation networks are to
   provide assured-quality end-to-end IP flows.  This draft discusses
   how to achieve QoS interoperability between 3GPP-based wireless
   networks and IETF/ITU-T based wireline IP networks.  In particular,
   this draft tries to describe a QoS-NSLP QoS model (QOSM) based on
   3GPP QoS classes and bearer service attributes. 3GPP TS 23.107 [5]
   specifies four universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) QoS
   classes (also called "traffic classes"), and the 3GPP-QOSM extensions
   include additional QSPEC parameters which may be optional.  The more
   detailed description of the 3GPP QOSM will be provided in the later
   version of this draft.

3.  3GPP QoS Classes and Bearer Service Attributes

   3GPP TS 23.107 specifies four different QoS classes for UMTS, and
   these QoS classes support a wide range of user applications.  TS
   23.107 also describes specific value ranges for each QoS class. 3GPP
   TS 203.207 [6] specifies the architecture and procedures for
   achieving end-to-end QoS across networks with the 3GPP QoS classes as
   a basis.  QSPEC in [3] already addresses most of generic QoS
   parameters, and therefore this draft identifies additional QSPEC
   parameters for the 3GPP QOSM.

3.1  Summary of 3GPP QoS Classes

   3GPP UMTS QoS classes were defined in [5] by taking the restrictions
   and limitations of the air interface into account.  The QoS
   mechanisms provided in the cellular network have to be robust and
   capable of providing reasonable QoS resolution.

   As mentioned above, there are four different QoS classes, i.e.,
   Conversational class, Streaming class, Interactive class, and
   Background class.  The main distinguishing factor between these QoS
   classes is how delay sensitive the traffic is.  For example,
   Conversational class is meant for traffic which is very delay
   sensitive while Background class is the most delay insensitive
   traffic class.

   Conversational and Streaming classes are mainly intended to be used
   to carry real-time traffic flows.  The main divider between them is
   how delay sensitive the traffic is.  Conversational real-time
   services, like video telephony, are the most delay sensitive
   applications and those data streams should be carried in
   Conversational class.

   Interactive and Background classes are mainly meant to be used by
   traditional Internet applications like WWW, E-mail, Telnet, FTP, and



Jeong, et al.           Expires November 18, 2005               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               3GPP QoS Model                     May 2005


   News.  Due to looser delay requirements, compared to Conversational
   and Streaming classes, both provide better error rate by means of
   channel coding and retransmission.  The main difference between
   Interactive and Background classes is that Interactive class is
   mainly used by interactive applications, e.g., interactive e-mail or
   interactive web browsing, while Background class is meant for
   background traffic, e.g., background download of e-mail or background
   file downloading.  Traffic in the Interactive class has higher
   priority in scheduling than Background class traffic, so background
   applications use transmission resources only when interactive
   applications do not need them.  This is very important in wireless
   environment where the bandwidth is scarce compared to fixed networks.

   To achieve QoS interoperability for end-to-end QoS, the mappings
   between 3GPP QoS classes (defined in TS 23.107) and non-3GPP QoS
   Classes such as Y.1541 and DiffServ classes will be essential.  The
   following two subsections illustrate possible mappings between them.
   Detailed mappings will be implementation specific.

3.1.1  Mapping between the TS 23.107 and Y.1541 QoS Classes

   Y.1541 proposes six QoS classes defined according to the desired QoS
   performance objectives [4].  These QoS classes support a wide range
   of user applications.  The QoS classes group performance objectives
   for one-way IP packet delay (IPTD), IP packet delay variation (IPDV),
   IP packet loss ratio (IPLR), and IP Error Ratio (IPER).  Classes 0
   and 1 support interactive real-time applications, and Classes 2, 3,
   and 4, support non-interactive applications.  Class 5 has all the QoS
   parameters unspecified.  These classes serve as a basis for
   agreements between end-users and service providers, and between
   service providers.  They support a wide range of traffic applications
   including point-to-point telephony, data transfer, multimedia
   conferencing, and others.  The limited number of classes supports the
   requirement for feasible implementation, particularly with respect to
   scale in global networks.

   Based on the definitions of the QoS Classes, the 3GPP Conversational
   and Streaming classes may correspond to Y.1541 classes 0 and 1,
   respectively.  The two classes of Y.1541 and TS 23.107 are intended
   to support real-time services.  The Conversational class and Y.1541
   class 0 have a more stringent latency requirement than the Streaming
   class and Y.1541 class 1.  In both specifications, jitter is intended
   to be limited.  In addition, the 3GPP Interactive class may
   correspond to Y.1541 classes 2, 3, and 4, and one of the relevant
   applications is interactive data.

3.1.2  Mapping between the TS 23.107 and DiffServ QoS Classes

   DiffServ [9] proposes differentiation in the queuing and forwarding
   treatment received by packets at the routers in the network domain,
   on the basis of DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs) included in their
   headers at the ingress of the network domain.  IETF has standardized
   two groups of behavior aggregates, namely expedited forwarding or EF
   (one class) and assured forwarding or AF (four classes each
   containing three drop-precedence levels).  The actual policies used
   for marking, queuing and forwarding of packets at routers in DiffServ
   domain is an implementation-specific issue.

   EF per-hop behavior (PHB) group has been defined with the intention
   of providing leased-line like service using DiffServ.  This is
   achieved by regulating the total rate of all the flows registered
   with the EF PHB class to be less than the service rate allocated to
   the EF PHB class at that node.  Strict policing is enforced on the
   flows, and any non-conforming packets are dropped at the ingress
   itself.

   The AF PHB group has provision for classifying packets into different
   precedence levels.  Three such levels have been specified and each
   level is associated with a drop precedence.  Thus, each AF class has
   three DSCPs reserved, one for each level.  AF PHB group defines a
   relationship between these three precedence levels.  If congestion
   occurs at a particular forwarding node, a packet with the lowest drop
   precedence must have the lowest probability of being dropped.
   Likewise, a packet with the highest drop precedence has the highest
   probability of dropping.

   Based on the definitions of the QoS Classes, it appears that the 3GPP
   Conversational class corresponds to EF PHB class which can support
   low latency and jitter, and the 3GPP Streaming class corresponds to
   AF 4 which can support low jitter.  The 3GPP Interactive class may
   correspond to AF 3 (which can support low latency (but not as low as
   in conversational class)), and the Background class may correspond to
   AF2, AF1, or BE PHB class (which does not impose any special QoS
   requirement except reliability).

3.2  QoS Attributes for 3GPP UMTS Bearer Services

   UMTS bearer service attributes describe the service provided by the
   UMTS network to the user of the UMTS bearer service.  A set of QoS
   attributes (QoS profile) are described below [5].

   (a) Traffic class: Traffic class represents the type of application
      (i.e., 'conversational', 'streaming', 'interactive', or
      'background') for which the UMTS bearer service is optimized.  By
      including the traffic class itself as an attribute, UMTS can make
      assumptions about the traffic source and optimize the transport



Jeong, et al.           Expires November 18, 2005               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               3GPP QoS Model                     May 2005


      for that traffic type.

   (b) Maximum bitrate (kbps): Maximum bitrate represents the maximum
      number of bits delivered by UMTS within a period of time, divided
      by the duration of the period.  The traffic is conformant with
      Maximum bitrate as long as it follows a token bucket algorithm
      where token rate equals Maximum bitrate.  The Maximum bitrate is
      the upper limit a user or application can accept or provide.  All
      UMTS bearer service attributes may be fulfilled for traffic up to
      the Maximum bitrate depending on the network conditions.

   (c) Guaranteed bitrate (kbps): Guaranteed bitrate represents the
      guaranteed number of bits delivered by UMTS within a period of
      time, divided by the duration of the period.  The traffic is
      conformant with the guaranteed bitrate as long as it follows a
      token bucket algorithm where token rate equals Guaranteed bitrate.
      UMTS bearer service attributes, e.g., delay and reliability
      attributes, are guaranteed for traffic up to the Guaranteed
      bitrate.  For the traffic exceeding the Guaranteed bitrate the
      UMTS bearer service attributes are not guaranteed.  This attribute
      describes the bitrate the UMTS bearer service shall guarantee to
      the user or application.  Guaranteed bitrate may be used to
      facilitate admission control based on available resources, and for
      resource allocation within UMTS.

   (d) Delivery order (y/n): Delivery order indicates whether the UMTS
      bearer shall provide in-sequence service data unit (SDU) delivery
      or not.  The SDU may correspond to an IP packet.  This attribute
      is derived from the user protocol (i.e., packet data protocol
      (PDP) type) and specifies if out-of-sequence SDUs are acceptable
      or not.  Whether out-of-sequence SDUs are dropped or re-ordered
      depends on the specified reliability Delivery order should be set
      to 'no' for PDP Type = 'IPv4' or 'IPv6'.

   (e) Maximum SDU size (octets): Maximum SDU size represents the
      maximum SDU size for which the network shall satisfy the
      negotiated QoS.  The maximum SDU size is used for admission
      control and policing and/or optimizing transport.  Handling by the
      network of packets larger than Maximum SDU size is implementation
      specific (e.g., they may be dropped or forwarded with decreased
      QoS).

   (f) SDU format information (bits): SDU format information represents
      the list of possible exact sizes of SDUs.  The radio access
      network (RAN) needs SDU size information to be able to operate in
      transparent radio link control (RLC) protocol mode, which is
      beneficial to spectral efficiency and delay when RLC re-
      transmission is not used.  Thus, if the application can specify

Internet-Draft               3GPP QoS Model                     May 2005


      SDU sizes, the bearer is less expensive.

   (d) SDU error ratio: SDU error ratio indicates the fraction of SDUs
      lost or detected as erroneous.  SDU error ratio is defined only
      for conforming traffic.  By reserving resources, SDU error ratio
      performance is independent of the loading conditions, whereas
      without reserved resources, such as in Interactive and Background
      classes, SDU error ratio is used as target value.  This attribute
      is used to configure the protocols, algorithms and error detection
      schemes.

   (h) Residual bit error ratio: Residual bit error ratio indicates the
      undetected bit error ratio in the delivered SDUs.  If no error
      detection is requested, Residual bit error ratio indicates the bit
      error ratio in the delivered SDUs.  This attribute is used to
      configure radio interface protocols, algorithms and error
      detection coding.

   (i) Delivery of erroneous SDUs (y/n/-): Delivery of erroneous SDUs
      indicates whether SDUs detected as erroneous shall be delivered or
      discarded. 'yes' implies that error detection is employed and that
      erroneous SDUs are delivered together with an error indication,
      'no' implies that error detection is employed and that erroneous
      SDUs are discarded, and '-' implies that SDUs are delivered
      without considering error detection.  This attribute is used to
      decide whether error detection is needed and whether frames with
      detected errors shall be forwarded or not.

   (j) Transfer delay (ms): Transfer delay indicates maximum delay for
      95th percentile of the distribution of delay for all delivered
      SDUs during the lifetime of a bearer service.  This attribute is
      related to the delay tolerated by the application.  In conjunction
      with the SDU error ratio attribute, care needs to be taken in
      deriving the value for the 95th percentile when an application
      desires, for example, that 99.9% of all transmitted packets are
      delivered within a certain time.  This attribute allows RAN to set
      transport formats and ARQ parameters.

   (k) Traffic handling priority: Traffic handling priority specifies
      the relative importance for handling of all SDUs belonging to the
      UMTS bearer compared to the SDUs of other bearers.  Within the
      interactive class, there is a definite need to differentiate
      between bearer qualities.  This is handled by using the traffic
      handling priority attribute, to allow UMTS to schedule traffic
      accordingly.  By definition, priority is an alternative to
      absolute guarantees, and thus these two attribute types cannot be
      used together for a single bearer.

Internet-Draft               3GPP QoS Model                     May 2005


   (l) Allocation/Retention Priority: Allocation/Retention Priority
      specifies the relative importance compared to other UMTS bearers
      for allocation and retention of the UMTS bearer.  Priority is used
      for differentiating between bearers when performing allocation and
      retention of a bearer.  In situations where resources are scarce,
      the relevant network elements can use the Allocation/Retention
      Priority to prioritize bearers with a high Allocation/Retention
      Priority over bearers with a low Allocation/Retention Priority
      when performing admission control.

   (m) Source statistics descriptor ('speech'/'unknown'): Source
      statistics descriptor specifies characteristics of the source of
      submitted SDUs.  Conversational speech has a well-known
      statistical behaviour.  By being informed that the SDUs for a UMTS
      bearer are generated by a speech source, RAN, the serving GPRS
      support node (SGSN) and the gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) and
      also the user equipment (UE) may, based on experience, calculate a
      statistical multiplex gain for use in admission control on the
      relevant interfaces.

   (n) Signaling Indication (Yes/No): Signaling Indication indicates the
      signaling nature of the submitted SDUs.  This attribute is
      additional to the other QoS attributes and does not over-ride
      them.  This attribute is only defined for the interactive traffic
      class.  If signaling indication is set to 'Yes', the UE should set
      the traffic handling priority to '1'.  Signaling traffic can have
      different characteristics to other interactive traffic, e.g.,
      higher priority, lower delay, and so on.  This attribute permits
      enhancing the RAN operation accordingly.

4.  Additional QSPEC Parameters for 3GPP QOSM

   Among the attributes described in Section 3, most of relevant
   attributes for QSPEC have been specified in [3].  Additional
   parameters which may need to be specified further include Guaranteed
   bitrate, Source statistics descriptor, Delivery of erroneous SDUs,
   Residual bit error ratio, and Signaling Indication.  This section
   briefly describes the format of these additional parameters which may
   be optional in QSPEC.  More detailed description and other possible
   parameters will be provided in the later version of this draft.

4.1  Token Bucket Extension

   The <Token Bucket Extension> parameter, "Guaranteed bitrate (Gbr)" is
   represented by a floating point number in the single-precision IEEE
   floating point format.

5.  Scenarios for End-to-End QoS Support

   This section describes end-to-end scenarios that may occur from a UE
   connected to a UTMS network.  The Figure 2 shows a network
   architecture [6] used to explain the scenario which illustrates how
   end-to-end QoS is delivered in the network environment where 3GPP and
   non-3GPP networks co-exist.

   Figure 2. An End-to-End Network Architecture

   It is assumed that the UE performs an IP bearer service (BS) manager
   function which enables end-to-end QoS using IP-based signaling (e.g.,
   NSIS signaling) towards the remote end.  It is also assumed that the
   GGSN supports DiffServ edge functions, and that the backbone IP
   network is DiffServ enabled.  The application layer (e.g., SIP/SDP)
   between the end hosts identifies the QoS requirements.  The QoS
   requirements from application layer are mapped down to create an NSIS
   session.  The UE shall establish the PDP context suitable for support
   of the NSIS session.  The GGSN may use information regarding the PDP
   context in order to select the appropriate DiffSer setting to apply.
   It may be possible for the GGSN to support the mappting between TS
   23.107 and Y.1541 QoS classes.

   Figure 3. An End-to-End Scenario

   The control of the QoS over the UMTS access network (from the UE to
   the GGSN) may be performed either from the terminal using the PDP
   context signaling.  Alternatively, subscription data accessed by the
   SGSN may override the QoS requested via signaling from the UE.  In
   this scenario, the terminal supports signaling via the NSIS protocol
   to control the QoS at the local and remote accesses.

   The QoS for the wireless access is provided by the PDP context.  The
   UE may control the wireless QoS through signaling for the PDP
   context.  The characteristics for the PDP context can be derived from
   the NSIS signaling information.

   The end-to-end QoS is provided by a local mechanism in the UE, the
   PDP context over the UMTS access network, DiffServ through the
   backbone IP network, and DiffServ in the remote access network in the
   scenario shown in Figures 2 and 3.  The NSIS signaling may control
   the QoS at both the local and remote accesses.  This function may be
   used to determine the characteristics for the PDP context, so the UE
   may perform the interworking between the NSIS signaling and PDP
   context.  The UE may provide control of the DiffServ (although this
   may be overwritten by the GGSN), and in effect, determine the
   appropriate interworking between the PDP context and DiffServ.

   An example scenario for end-to-end QoS signaling is described below.

   -  The UE sends an Activate (Secondary) PDP Context message to the
      SGSN with the UMTS QoS parameters, and the SGSN sends the
      corresponding Create PDP Context message to the GGSN.

   -  The GGSN authorizes the PDP context activation request according
      to the local operator's IP bearer resource based policy, the local
      operator's admission control function and the GPRS roaming
      agreements and sends a Create PDP Context Response message back to
      the SGSN.

   -  The radio access bearer (RAB) setup is done by the RAB assignment
      procedure, and the SGSN sends an Activate (Secondary) PDP Context
      Accept message to UE.

   -  Upon receiving the Activation PDP Context Accept message, the QoS-
      NSLP at the UE as a QoS NSIS Initiator (QNI) sends a QoS-NSLP
      RESERVE message containing the Initiator QSPEC to the next hop in
      the external IP network through the GGSN.  The Initiator QSPEC
      specifies parameters specific to the 3GPP QOSM and other generic
      QSPEC parameters for the flow.  The GGSN processes the NSIS
      RESERVE message based on the PDP context and performs the
      translation function for mapping between UMTS QoS classes and
      DiffServ classes.

Internet-Draft               3GPP QoS Model                     May 2005


   In the example above, the Create PDP Context Request message was
   created before sending the NSIS message.  However, it is also
   possible to trigger the Create PDP Context Request message after
   receiving the RESERVE message. Note that QoS mapping between the UMTS
   and DiffServ QoS classes may occur at the UE and GGSN.  The signaling
   procedure for QoS interworking between Y.1541 and UMTS QoS Classes may
   be similar to the procedure described above.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no new security considerations based on this draft at the
   moment.  Security considerations will be provided in the later
   version of this draft, if any.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   QSPEC template, in accordance with BCP 26 RFC 2434 [RFC2434]. [2]
   requires IANA to create a new registry for QoS Model Identifiers.
   The QoS Model Identifier (QOSM ID) is a 32-bit value carried in a
   QSPEC object.  The allocation policy for new QOSM IDs is TBD.  This
   document also defines five new objects for the QSPEC Template, as
   detailed in Section 4.  Values are to be assigned for them from the
   NTLP Object Type registry.
