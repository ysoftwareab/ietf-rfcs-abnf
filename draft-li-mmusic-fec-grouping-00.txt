Abstract

   This document defines the semantics that allows for grouping of
   forward error correction (FEC) streams with the protected payload
   streams in Session Description Protocol (SDP). The semantics defined
   in this document is to be used with Grouping of Media Lines in the
   Session Description Protocol (RFC 3388) to group together "m" lines
   in the same session.

1. Introduction

   The media lines in an SDP [3] session are usually associated with
   each other. SDP itself does not provide methods to convey the
   relationships between the media lines. Such relationships are
   indicated the extension to SDP as defined in Grouping of Media Lines
   in the Session Description Protocol (RFC 3388) [2]. RFC 3388 defines
   two types of semantics: Lip Synchronization, and Flow Identification.

   Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a common technique to achieve
   robust communication in error-prone environments. In this document,
   we define the semantics that allows for grouping of FEC streams with
   the protected payload streams in SDP by further extending RFC 3388.


2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD, "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3. Forward Error Correction (FEC)

   Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a common technique to achieve
   robust communication in error-prone environments. In FEC,
   communication uses a bandwidth that is more than payload to send
   redundantly coded payload information. The receivers can readily
   recover the original payload even when some communication is lost in
   the transmission. Compare to other error correction technique (such
   as re-transmission), FEC can achieve much lower transmission delay,
   and does not have the problem of implosion.

INTERNET-DRAFT        FEC Grouping Semantics in SDP        June 24, 2005



   In general, the FEC data can be send in two different ways: (1)
   multiplexed together with the original payload stream, or (2) as a
   separate stream. It is thus necessary to define mechanisms to
   indicate the association relationship between the FEC data and the
   payload data they protect.

   When FEC data are multiplexed with the original payload stream, the
   association relationship is indicated as specified in RTP Payload for
   Redundant Audio Data (RFC 2198) [4].

   When FEC data are sent as a separate stream from the payload data,
   the association relationship SHOULD be indicated with the FEC media
   line grouping as specified in this document.

4. FEC Grouping

4.1. FEC Group

   Each "a=group" line are used to indicate the association relationship
   between the FEC streams and the payload stream. The streams included
   in one "a=group" line are called a "FEC Group".

   Grouping streams in a FEC group only indicates the association
   relationship between streams. The detailed FEC protection
   scheme/parameters are conveyed through the mechanism of the
   particular FEC algorithm used. For example, the FEC grouping is used
   for generic RTP payload for FEC (RFC YYYY) [5] to indicate the
   association relationship between the FEC stream and the payload
   stream. The detailed protection level and length information for the
   ULP algorithm is communicated in band within the FEC stream.

4.2. FEC Grouping Semantics

   The FEC semantics is defined by the following BNF:

       Semantics         = "FEC"

4.3. Backward Compatibility

   The backward compatibility is generally handled as specified in RFC
   3388 [2].

   Depending on the implementation, a node that does not understand FEC
   grouping (either does not understand line grouping at all, or just
   does not understand the FEC semantics) might respond to an offer
   containing FEC grouping either (1) with an answer which ignores the
   grouping attribute, or (2) with a refusal to the request (e.g., 488
   Not acceptable here or 606 Not Acceptable).





Adam Li                                                         [Page 3]

   In the first case, the original sender of the offer MUST establish
   the connection without FEC. In the second case, if the sender of the
   offer still wishes to establish the session, it SHOULD re-try the
   request with an offer without FEC.

4.4. Example of FEC Grouping

   The following example shows a session description of a multicast
   conference. The first media stream (mid:1) contains the audio stream.
   The second media stream (mid:2) contains the Generic FEC [5]
   protection for the audio stream. These two streams form an FEC Group.
   The relationship between the two streams is indicated by the
   "a=group:FEC 1 2" line. The FEC stream is sent to the same multicast
   group and has the same TTL as the audio, but on a port number two
   higher. Likewise, the video stream (mid:3) and its Generic FEC
   protection stream (mid:4) forms another FEC group. The relationship
   between the two streams is indicated by the "a=group:FEC 3 4" line.
   The FEC stream is sent to a different multicast address, but has the
   same port number (30004) as the payload video stream.

5. Security Consideration

   There is a weak threat for the receiver that the FEC grouping can be
   modified to indicate FEC relationships that do not exist. It is
   recommended that the receiver implementation SHOULD do integrity
   check to thwart such threats.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document defines the semantics to be used with grouping of media
   lines in SDP as defined in RFC 3388. The semantics defined in this
   document are to be registered by the IANA when they are published in
   standard track RFCs.

   The following semantics need to be registered with IANA.
