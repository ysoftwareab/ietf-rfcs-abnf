        Generic Route Constraint Distribution Mechanism for BGP
            draft-zzhang-idr-bgp-rt-constrains-extension-01

Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism based upon Constrained Route
   Distribution for BGP (RFC 4684) that works with various types of BGP
   Community-like Path Attributes.  Similar to RFC 4684, this mechanism
   can be used to build a route distribution graph to limit the
   propagation of BGP Routes.  Unlike RFC 4684, this mechanism is not
   restricted to BGP Extended Communities (RFC 4360).

1.1.  Constrained Route Distribution

   In BGP/MPLS Layer 3 VPNs [RFC4364], Route Target Extended Communities
   [RFC4360] are used to control VPN membership.  Networks providing VPN
   services may be large.  In such networks, VPN routes for a given VPN
   may be only needed at a small subset of Provider Edge (PE) routers.

   The Constrained Route Distribution feature [RFC4684] assists in
   scaling such large VPN networks by building a distribution graph of
   VPN routes through the BGP routing infrastructure.  Much of the
   benefit of this feature comes from BGP routers, such as Route
   Reflectors [RFC4456], avoiding the work of sending all VPN routes to
   a PE that may simply discard unneded routes.  Instead, the PE may
   receive only the VPN routes for VPNs located on that PE.

1.2.  Brief Summary of Constrained Route Distribution Procedure

   BGP Speakers implementing [RFC4684] advertise their interest in
   receiving VPN routes that contain specific Route Target Extended
   Communities by advertising Route Target membership NLRI.

   The format of the Route Target membership NLRI in [RFC4684] follows.
   It may be of length from 0 to 96 bits.

           +-------------------------------+
           | Origin AS        (4 octets)   |
           +-------------------------------+
           | Route Target     (8 octets)   |
           +                               +
           |                               |
           +-------------------------------+

   The Origin AS contains the Autonomous System number of the originator
   of this NLRI.

   The Route Target contains a BGP Route Target Extended Community, or a
   prefix of a BGP Route Target Extended Community.

   Route Target membership NLRI act as a filter mechanism on VPN routes.
   The BGP Speaker receiving these Route Target membership NLRI from
   another BGP Speaker will propagate VPN routes that match these
   membership NLRI.  VPN routes that do not match these membership NLRI
   will not be propagated.

   The propagation of Route Target membership NLRI from an originating
   PE router to other interested BGP Speakers builds a distribution
   graph for VPN routes matching the desired Route Targets.

1.3.  Need for a Generic Route Constraint Distribution Mechanism

   Since BGP/MPLS Layer 3 VPNs were introduced, many new BGP VPN
   features have been created that leverage the original concepts in
   [RFC4364].  While many of these new features similarly use Route
   Target Extended Communities for VPN membership, some use other
   Extended Communities.  That is, they utilize a different Type/Sub-
   Type code than those defined in [RFC4360].

   While [RFC4684] is explicit about being utilized for Route Targets,
   the definition of a Route Target has become more fluid as VPN
   features have been introduced; for example, ES-Import from [RFC7432].
   It could be observed that that [RFC4684] is capable of being used on
   any type of [RFC4360] BGP Extended Community, for any VPN route type.
   However, other attributes are coming to be used for idenitifying VPN
   routes and a procedure that is only applicable to Extended
   Communities cannot be used.

   [RFC5701] introduced the IPv6 Address Specific BGP Extended Community
   Attribute.  This type of BGP Community permits the encoding of an
   IPv6 address as the Global Administrator of a route.  Similar to the
   [RFC4360] Extended Communities, the IPv6 Address Specific type
   carries a Type and Sub-Type field.  One of the Type/Sub-Type
   allocations is for an IPv6 address specific Route Target.  This
   permits operators to leverage IPv6 addressing when building their
   VPNs.

   IPv6 Extensions for Route Target Distribution
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ipv6-rt-constrain] proposes to permit matching for
   IPv6 address specific Extended Communities using [RFC4684] by
   overloading the NLRI length for Route Target membership NLRI for NLRI
   longer than 96 bits.  (See [RFC4684], Section 4.)  However, this
   doesn't account for Route Target membership NLRI length shorter than
   96 bits.  These shorter prefixes permit matching of many more
   specific Route Targets from a less specific Route Target membership
   BGP Route.  Therefore, a different mechanism is needed for safely
   matching IPv6 address specific Route Targets.

   The simplest change would be to utilize a new AFI/SAFI for IPv6 Route
   Target Distribution that only matches IPv6 address specific Route
   Targets.  It can be further observed that various forms of BGP
   "Community" types continue to evolve to suit a variety of BGP route
   filtering needs, including those not intended for VPN services.
   Examples of these include BGP Large Communities [RFC8092], BGP Wide
   Communities [I-D.ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities], and Bitmask Route
   Targets [I-D.zzhang-idr-bitmask-route-target].

   This document proposes a mechanism to match arbitrary BGP Community-
   like attributes, including those with Route Target-like semantics,
   for building Constrained Route Distribution graphs for BGP routes
   containing those attributes.

2.  Community-like Attributes

2.1.  Definition of Community-like Attributes

   BGP Communities were originally introduced in [RFC1997].  That RFC
   contains the definition, "A community is a group of destinations
   which share some common property."  Recall that in BGP-4 [RFC4271], a
   BGP Route is defined as a pairing of destinations (NLRI) with Path
   Attributes.

   In practice, a Community is implemented as an element of a BGP Path
   Attribute that is used to mark a prefix in a way that protocol and
   BGP policy mechanisms may be used to interact with that BGP Route.

   Since [RFC1997], this idea of marking BGP Routes has been extended to
   other mechanisms such as BGP Extended Communities [RFC4360], and BGP
   Large Communities [RFC8092].  Other similar mechanisms are regularly
   considered for standardization.

   For purposes of this document, a Community-like Attribute (CLA) has
   the semantics of being an attribute of a BGP Path Attribute that is
   intended to interact with protocol mechanisms and may enable policy
   mechanisms to interact with that BGP Route.  Thus, classic [RFC1997]
   BGP Communities, BGP Extended Communities, and Large BGP Communities
   are all CLAs.

2.2.  Prefix Structure of BGP Community-like Attributes

   [RFC4684] provides for matching less-specific BGP Extended
   Communities by utilizing a shorter NLRI length for the Route Target
   membership NLRI.  To highlight situations where such summarization is
   useful, consider the various forms of Route Target extended community
   from [RFC4360].  In each of those types, the Sub-Type field is 0x02,
   with the Type selecting the format:

   o  0x00 - 2-octet Global Administrator field, 4-octet Local
      Administrator field.

   o  0x01 - 4-octet Global Administrator field, 2-octet Local
      Administrator field.

   o  0x02 - 4-octet IPv4 Address Global Administrator field, 2-octet
      Local Administrator field.

Internet-Draft                 generic-rtc                  January 2021


   The Global Administrator field for Route Targets is typically an
   Autonomous System number.

   Summarization offers several useful options where the Sub-Type of the
   Route Target Extended Community is 0x02.  Examples include:

   o  Type = 0x00 and NLRI length = 48: Match all 2-octet Global
      Administrator fields of a given value; for example Origin AS
      64511:Route Target 64496:*.

   o  Type = 0x01 and NLRI length = 64: Match all 4-octet Global
      Administrator fields of a given value; for example Origin AS
      64511:Route Target 65551:*.

   o  Type = 0x03 and NLRI length = 88: Match all IPv4 Address Global
      Administrator fields of a given value; for example Origin AS
      64511:Route Target 192.0.2.*:*.

   Similarly, for inter-domain purposes, matching all Route Target
   Membership NLRI for a given Origin AS may be useful:

   o  NLRI length = 32; for example Origin AS 64511:*.  This matches all
      classes of Extended Community originated from AS 64511.

   o  NLRI length = 44; for example Origin AS 64511:0x0002:*.  This
      matches all Extended Communities originated from AS 64511 that
      have the first two octets as 0x0002, which includes the class of
      Extended Communities that are 2-octet Global Administrator Route
      Target types.

   It's even possible to utilize a Prefix Length that splits a well
   defined field.  When the structure of that field is understood,
   clever operators may be able to generate summaries.  It should be
   noted that understanding the intent of such summarization may be
   difficult to discern from the NLRI in question.  Some examples:

   o  NLRI length = 31; for example Origin AS 6451[01]:*.  This matches
      all classes of Extended Community originated from Origin ASes
      64510 and 64511.

   o  NLRI length = 47; for example Origin AS 64511:0x0002:*.  This
      matches all two-octet AS-Specific Extended Communities originated
      from AS 64511 that include Route Targets (0x02) and Route Origins
      (0x03).

   The purpose of highlighting that a variable NLRI length can be
   applied in these ways is to demonstrate the flexibility of
   summarization.  This is most true when the structure of that

   attribute is arranged most general to most specific; that is, Global
   to Local Admin as we have in Extended Communities.

3.  Specification

3.1.  NLRI Definition

   To support applying Constrained Route Distribution procedures to BGP
   Community-like attributes, the following NLRI is defined.  The
   "Generic Route Constraint Distribution Mechanism" NLRI uses a new
   SAFI (TBD) with the following format:


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                     Origin AS (4 octets)                      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    CLA Selector (2 octets)      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   ~                     CLA Value (variable)                      ~
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   It can be observed that the format of this NLRI emulates the format
   of the Route Target membership NLRI from [RFC4684], with the addition
   of the CLA selector to permit the recipient to correctly interpret
   the CLA value.

3.2.  NLRI Length Encoding

   To support potentially large Community-like Values, the NLRI length
   field is encoded using 1 or 2 octets using the same mechanism as
   [RFC5575], Section 4.  The text from that RFC is copied here:

       If the NLRI length value is smaller than 240 (0xf0 hex),
       the length field can be encoded as a single octet.
       Otherwise, it is encoded as an extended-length 2-octet
       value in which the most significant nibble of the first
       byte is all ones.

       In the figure above, values less-than 240 are encoded
       using two hex digits (0xnn).  Values above 240 are encoded
       using 3 hex digits (0xfnnn).  The highest value that can
       be represented with this encoding is 4095.  The value 241
       is encoded as 0xf0f1.

3.3.  Operation

   The two-octet CLA Selector identifies the type of Community-like
   attribute in a BGP route to apply the Constrained Route Distribution
   procedures to.  The value of this field, registered with IANA, may
   identify Community-like attributes that exist in a given BGP Path
   Attribute, or internal fields of structured BGP Path Attributes.
   Examples of a stand-alone BGP Path Attribute may be [RFC1997] classic
   BGP Communities or [RFC8092] Large BGP Communities.  Examples of
   internal community values may be Bitmask Route Targets
   [I-D.zzhang-idr-bitmask-route-target] defined inside a BGP Wide
   Community Container, or newly defined sub-TLVs in a BGP Tunnel
   Encapsulation Attribute [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps].

   The Community-like Attribute is encoded in the CLA Value field.
   Sufficient octets are encoded for the Prefix Length of this NLRI.

4.3.  Bitmask Route Target

   [I-D.zzhang-idr-bitmask-route-target] defines Bitmask Route Targets.
   Bitmask Route Targets are encoded within the BGP Community Container
   Path Attribute, which is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities].  The structure of the Bitmask
   Route Target, from the Internet-Draft, is:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  GA Type        |  GA Length        |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  Global Administrator (variable length)                       ~
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  Local Administrator                                          |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  Bitmask Length |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     ~                   Bitmask (variable length)                   ~
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     GA Type and GA Length are 1 octet in length.

     Local Administrator is 4 octets in length.

     The Bitmask is a number of octets that will fit the Bitmask Length.

     The following GA Types and corresponding lengths are defined:

     o  1: AS Number, 4 octets

     o  2: IPv4 Address, 4 octets

     o  3: IPv6 Address, 16 octets

   The Community Selector for Bitmask Route Targets is assigned 3, per
   this document.

   The Bitmask Route Target, a Community-like attribute, is carried as
   the payload (that is, the value portion) of another Path Attribute.
   The Generic Route Constraint Distribution Mechanism NLRI is not
   constructed to match any of the outer portions of the Community
   Container; rather it matches only the payload, that is, the Bitmask
   Route Target itself.

4.3.1.  AS Number Bitmask Route Target

   The encoding for a Generic Route Constraint Distribution Mechanism
   NLRI for Origin AS 64511 for an AS-Number based Bitmask Route Target
   for AS 65551 with Local Administrator value 100 and a bitmask of
   0xc0ffee (3 octets) would be:

   NLRI length          = 0xa0 (160)
   Origin AS            = 0x0000fbff (64511)
   Community Selector   = 0x0002 (3)         # Bitmask Route Target
   Community-Like Value = 0x01 (1)           # GA Type AS Number

                          0xc0ffee           # Bitmask

4.3.2.  IPv6 Address Bitmask Route Target

   The encoding for a Generic Route Constraint Distribution Mechanism
   NLRI for Origin AS 64511 for an AS-Number based Bitmask Route Target
   for 2001:DB8::2 with Local Administrator value 100 and a bitmask of
   0xc0ffee (3 octets) would be:

   NLRI length          = 0xf108 (264)
   Origin AS            = 0x0000fbff (64511)
   Community Selector   = 0x0002 (2)         # Bitmask Route Target
   Community-Like Value = 0x01 (1)           # GA Type IPv6 Address
                          0x04 (16)          # GA Length
                          0x2001 0DB8 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000

                                             # Global Administrator
                          0x00000064 (100)   # Local Administrator
                          0x03 (3)           # Bitmask Length
                          0xc0ffee           # Bitmask

5.  Security Considerations
