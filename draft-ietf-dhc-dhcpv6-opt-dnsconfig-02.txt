Abstract

   This document describes DHCPv6 options for passing a list of
   available DNS Servers and a domain search list to a client.

1. Introduction

   This document describes two options for passing configuration
   information related to Domain Name Service (DNS) [1, 2] in DHCPv6
   [4].

2. Requirements

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,

   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC2119 [3].

3. Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 as defined
   in section "Terminology" of the DHCP specification.

4. Domain Name Server option

   The Domain Name Server option provides a list of one or more IP
   addresses of DNS servers to which a client's DNS resolver MAY send
   DNS queries [2].  The DNS servers are listed in the order of
   preference for use by the client resolver.

   The format of the Domain Name Server option is:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |                   DNS-server (IP address)                     |

      |                                                               |

   option-code:   OPTION_DNS_SERVERS (tbd)

5. Domain Search List option

   A server sends a Domain Search List option to the DHCP client to
   specify the domain search list the client is to use when resolving
   hostnames with DNS.  This option does not apply to other name
   resolution mechanisms.

   The format of the Domain Search List option is:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      OPTION_DOMAIN_LIST       |         option-len            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                         searchstring                          |
      |                              ...                              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   option-code:   OPTION_DOMAIN_LIST (tbd)

   option-length: Length of the 'searchstring' field in octets

   searchstring:  The specification of the list of domain names in the
      Domain Search List

   The list of domain names in the 'searchstring' MUST be encoded as
   specified in section "Representation and use of domain names" of the
   DHCPv6 specification [4].

6. Appearance of these options

   The Domain Name Server option MUST appear only in the following
   messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Confirm, Renew, Rebind,
   Information-Request, Reply.

   The Domain Search List option MUST appear only in the following
   messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Confirm, Renew, Rebind,
   Information-Request, Reply.

7. Security Considerations

   The Domain Name Server option may be used by an intruder DHCP server
   to cause DHCP clients to send DNS queries to an intruder DNS server.
   The results of these misdirected DNS queries may be used to spoof DNS
   names.

Internet-Draft    DNS Configuration Options for DHCPv6      October 2002


   The Domain Search List option may be used by an intruder DHCP server
   to cause DHCP clients to search through invalid domains for
   incompletely specified domain names.  The results of these
   misdirected searches may be used to spoof DNS names.

   To avoid attacks through the Domain Name Server option, the DHCP
   client SHOULD use authenticated DHCP (see section "Authentication of
   DHCP messages" in the DHCPv6 specification).

   Because the Domain Search List option may be used to spoof DNS name
   resolution in a way that cannot be detected by DNS security
   mechanisms like DNSSEC [5], DHCP clients and servers MUST use
   authenticated DHCP when a Domain Search List option is included in a
   DHCP message.

8. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to these options from the
   option-code space defined in section "DHCPv6 Options" of the DHCPv6
   specification [4].
