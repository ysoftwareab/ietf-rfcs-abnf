Abstract

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC1531] provides a method
   for a host to retrieve common configuration parameters at boot time.
   These include the host's IP address, default gateway, subnet mask,
   DNS server, and other useful things.

   When a host is booted from the network, it does not have access to
   these configuration parameters from its local or network disk right
   away; it relies instead on DHCP to provide them.  One such parameter
   that is not yet provided is a list of IP hosts to which to send SNMP

Internet Draft     DHCP Option for SNMP Notifications     September 2002


   notifications [RFC1448] during the boot process, particularly if the
   boot fails.  As the host is already gleaning similar information from
   DHCP, a new option to specify these SNMP "trap" hosts appears to be
   the simplest method to gain this information.  Hosts not booting from
   the network benefit as well, since SNMP notification hosts can now be
   configured centrally through DHCP.

   This document describes a proposed DHCP option that specifies a list
   of SNMP notification hosts to which SNMP notifications should be
   sent.

   McCloghrie.


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  DHCP Option

   The snmp-trap-host option specifies a list of IP addresses to which
   SNMP notifications should be sent.  SNMP notification hosts SHOULD be
   listed in order of preference; an implementation SHOULD send each
   notification to as many of the hosts listed as possible.  Its format
   is identical to the router option [RFC2132].  The code for this
   option is TBD.  The minimum length is 4 octets, and the length MUST
   be a multiple of 4.

       Code   Len         Address 1               Address 2
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
      | TBD |  n  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |  a1 |  a2 |  ...
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--


3.  Security Considerations

   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security mechanisms.
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
   protocol specification [RFC 2131].

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a DHCP option number for this option.


5.  Summary

   This document describes a DHCP option for configuring a list of SNMP
   notification hosts.
