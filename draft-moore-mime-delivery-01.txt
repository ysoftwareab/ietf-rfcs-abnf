MIME Notifications                                         21 March 1994



Appendix: changes since the last draft


[1] renamed multipart/delivery-status-notification to
    multipart/notification, allowing it to be a general container.
    type.

[2] rename "returned message" body part to message/sample.

[3] remove "links" that referred to the content-id of other body
    parts.

[4] rename message/delivery-report to message/notification.

[5] use 822 headers instead of STIF; tweaked some of the fields.

[6] added "motivations" paragraph to introduction.

[7] rearranged the parameters for the report, moved date from
    per-recipient to per-report (was this a good idea?), distinguished
    "source" of an error from "issuing mta".  removed "text", instead
    recommended a comment.

[8] added additional smtp-like status codes for conditions that SMTP
    doesn't ever have to report.


To Do:

[1] The current pair of drafts doesn't ensure one notification per
    sender-specified-recipient.  We need to decide how to handle mail
    forwarding to multiple recipients.

[2] The recipient addresses may need to be encoded to fit in ASCII;
    how best to do this?  It's probably best to encode the fields of the
    message/notification body part in the same was as suggested for ESMTP,
    rather than encoding the entire body part.

[3] Either define some extension suffixes for 3-digit SMTP codes, or
    get rid of them.

[4] Do we need a place to put more human-readable stuff?  A field for
    text explanation for an error code in-addition-to and separate-from
    text returned by the remote MTA?

[5] Should we add a place for "delayed" notifications?  If so, we need
    to elaborate on the use of 4yz status-codes (sometimes they would mean
    "delivery abandoned due to persistent temporary failure conditions"
    and sometimes they just mean "delayed due to temporary failure
    conditions")

[6] The draft needs lots of additional examples.
