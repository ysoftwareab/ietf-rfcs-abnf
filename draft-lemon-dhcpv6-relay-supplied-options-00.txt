Abstract

   This document describes a general mechanism whereby a DHCPv6 relay
   agent can provide options to a DHCPv6 server that the DHCPv6 server
   can then provide to the DHCPv6 client.

Internet-Draft         Relay-Supplied DHCP Options            March 2010


1.  Introduction

   There are some cases where a DHCP relay agent has information that
   would be useful to provide to a DHCP client, and the DHCP server does
   not have that information.  The DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315] does
   not provide a mechanism whereby the DHCP relay can provide options to
   the DHCP client.  This document defines an extension to DHCP that
   allows DHCP relay agents to propose options to be sent to DHCP
   clients.

   The motivation for this draft comes from a proposal from the Mobile
   IPv6 working group, DHCP Options for Home Information Discovery in
   MIPv6 [hiopt].  This draft initially proposed a one-off mechanism
   whereby the relay agent can provide a home agent option to be sent
   back to the DHCP client.  It is our belief that there may be other
   uses cases for this functionality, so rather than requiring special
   code in the server for each such use case, we propose to provide a
   general mechanism that will satisfy any such use case.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The following terms and acronyms are used in this document:

   DHCP  - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Version 6 [RFC3315]

   RSOO  - Relay-Supplied Options option


2.  Protocol Summary

   DHCP clients do not support a mechanism for receiving options from
   relay agents--the function of the relay agent is simply to deliver
   the payload from the server.  Consequently, in order for the DHCP
   relay agent to provide options to the client, it sends those options
   to the DHCP server, encapsulated in a Relay-Supplied Options option.
   The DHCP server can then choose to place those options in the
   response it sends to the client.


3.  Encoding

   In order to supply options for the DHCP server, the relay agent sends

Internet-Draft         Relay-Supplied DHCP Options            March 2010


   a Relay-Supplied Options option in the Relay-Forward message.  This
   option encapsulates whatever options the relay agent wishes to
   provide to the DHCPv6 server.

   +------+--------+----------+-----+----------+
   + code | length | option 1 | ... | option n |
   +------+--------+----------+-----+----------+


4.  DHCP Relay Agent Behavior

   Relay agents MAY include a Relay-Supplied Options option in the
   option payload of a Relay-Forward message.  Relay agents MUST NOT
   modify the contents of any message before forwarding it to the DHCP
   client.


5.  DHCP Server Behavior

   A DHCP server that implements this spec must have a user-configurable
   setting which determines whether or not it accepts a Relay-Supplied
   Options option.  If the DHCP server is configured not to accept the
   RSOO, it MUST discard any such options that it receives.

   DHCP servers normally construct a list of options that are candidates
   to send to the DHCP client, and then constructs the DHCP packet
   according to section 17.2.2 of DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

   If the server receives an RSOO and is configured to accept it, it
   SHOULD add any options that appear in the RSOO for which it has no
   internal candidate to the list of options that are candidates to send
   to the DHCP client.  The server SHOULD discard any options that
   appear in the RSOO for which it already has one or more candidates.

   Aside from the addition of options from the RSOO, the DHCP server
   should then construct a DHCP packet as it normally would, and
   transmit it to the DHCP client as described in DHCPv6 [RFC3315].


6.  Security Considerations

   This document provides a mechanism whereby a relay agent can inject
   options into the response the DHCP server sends to the DHCP client.
   Because the DHCP server prefers its own configured options to those
   supplied by the relay agent, this can't be used as a means for
   overriding server-supplied options.  However, it is still possible in
   some configurations for a rogue DHCP server to supply additional
   options to the DHCP client.

Internet-Draft         Relay-Supplied DHCP Options            March 2010


   For this reason, DHCP servers in environments where a rogue relay
   could interject itself into the packet flow SHOULD authenticate the
   relay agent as described in section 21.1 of DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

   Note, however, that in any environment where this is possible, it
   would also possible for the attacker to simply supply a bogus DHCPv6
   packet, so unless the packet from the server is authenticated, the
   same risk exists even in environments where the RSOO is not supported
   by or enabled on the DHCP server.
