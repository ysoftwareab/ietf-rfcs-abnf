1.  Introduction

   This document provides illustrations for
   [I-D.filsfilscheng-spring-srv6-srh-compression] compressed SRv6
   Segment List Encoding in the Segment Routing Header (SRH).

2.  Terminology

   This document leverages the terminology introduced in [RFC8402],
   [RFC8754], and [RFC8986].  The definition of the most important terms
   is reproduced in this section for convenience.

2.1.  From RFC 8402

   Segment Routing domain (SR domain): the set of nodes participating in
   the source-based routing model.  These nodes may be connected to the
   same physical infrastructure (e.g., a Service Provider's network).
   They may as well be remotely connected to each other (e.g., an
   enterprise VPN or an overlay).  If multiple protocol instances are
   deployed, the SR domain most commonly includes all of the protocol
   instances in a network.  However, some deployments may wish to
   subdivide the network into multiple SR domains, each of which
   includes one or more protocol instances.  It is expected that all
   nodes in an SR domain are managed by the same administrative entity.

2.2.  From RFC 8754

   SR Source Node (section 3.1): A SR source node is any node that
   originates an IPv6 packet with a segment (i.e., SRv6 SID) in the
   destination address of the IPv6 header.

   Transit Node (section 3.2): A transit node is any node forwarding an
   IPv6 packet where the destination address of that packet is not
   locally configured as a segment or a local interface.  A transit node
   is not required to be capable of processing a segment or SRH.

   SR Segment Endpoint Node (section 3.3): An SR segment endpoint node
   is any node receiving an IPv6 packet where the destination address of
   that packet is locally configured as a segment or local interface.

2.3.  From RFC 8986

   SID Format: This document defines an SRv6 SID as consisting of
   LOC:FUNCT:ARG, where a locator (LOC) is encoded in the L most
   significant bits of the SID, followed by F bits of function (FUNCT)
   and A bits of arguments (ARG).  L, the locator length, is flexible,
   and an operator is free to use the locator length of their choice.  F
   and A may be any value as long as L+F+A <= 128.  When L+F+A is less
   than 128, then the remaining bits of the SID MUST be zero.  A locator
   may be represented as B:N where B is the SRv6 SID block (IPv6 prefix
   allocated for SRv6 SIDs by the operator) and N is the identifier of
   the parent node instantiating the SID.

3.  Intra-SR-Domain Deployment Model

   The content of this section is a partial reproduction of section 5
   for [RFC8754].  The reader can easily understand that the dual
   measures provided can prevent SR packets from leaving the SR domain.

   The use of the SIDs exclusively within the SR domain and solely for
   packets of the SR domain is an important deployment model.

   This enables the SR domain to act as a single routing system.

3.1.  Securing the SR Domain

   Nodes outside the SR domain are not trusted: they cannot directly use
   the SIDs of the domain.  This is enforced by two levels of access
   control lists:

   *  Any packet entering the SR domain and destined to a SID within the
      SR domain is dropped.  This may be realized with the following
      logic.  Other methods with equivalent outcome are considered
      compliant:

      -  Allocate all the SIDs from a block S/s

      -  Configure each external interface of each edge node of the
         domain with an inbound infrastructure access list (IACL) that
         drops any incoming packet with a destination address in S/s

      -  Failure to implement this method of ingress filtering exposes
         the SR domain to source-routing attacks, as described and
         referenced in [RFC5095]

   *  The distributed protection in #1 is complemented with per-node
      protection, dropping packets to SIDs from source addresses outside
      the SR domain.  This may be realized with the following logic.
      Other methods with equivalent outcome are considered compliant:

      -  Assign all interface addresses from prefix A/a

      -  At node k, all SIDs local to k are assigned from prefix Sk/sk

      -  Configure each internal interface of each SR node k in the SR
         domain with an inbound IACL that drops any incoming packet with
         a destination address in Sk/sk if the source address is not in
         A/a.

4.  General Addressing

   The illustrations in this document use the IPv6 documentation prefix
   2001:db8::/32.

   Loopback interface addresses are allocated from the prefix
   2001:db8:a::/48.

   SRv6 SIDs are allocated from the prefix 2001:db8:b::/48.

   An operator deploying this solution could instead select any sub-
   prefix out of the prefix allocated by their Regional Internet
   Registry (RIR) to this operator or from the Unique Local Unicast
   (ULA) prefix.  ULA provides the uniqueness and privacy
   characteristics defined in Section 1 of [RFC4193].

                        Figure 1: Reference topology

   N10 to N19 represent the potential SR source and SR segment endpoint
   nodes in the SR domain.

   The SR domain may include any number of transit nodes (not shown)
   between the nodes that are represented in this figure.

5.1.  Addressing and SRv6 SID allocation

   Nodes N10 to N19 have a loopback interface configured with the
   address 2001:db8:a:NN00::, where NN is the node identifier.

   Nodes N10 to N19 instantiate the SID 2001:db8:b:NN00::, where NN is
   the node identifier, with Locator-Block length (LBL) = 48, Locator-
   Node length (LNL)= 16, Function length (FL) = 0, Argument length (AL)
   = 64, and bound to the End behavior with the NEXT-C-SID and USD
   flavors.

   The "Endpoint" (or "End") behavior is the most basic operation that
   can be performed by an SR segment endpoint node (i.e., a node that
   identifies the destination address of a received packet as matching a
   locally instantiated SID).  It updates the destination address of the
   packet with the next SID in the segment list.  The pseudocode of the
   End behavior with the NEXT-C-SID and USD flavors is specified in
   section 4.1.1 of [I-D.filsfilscheng-spring-srv6-srh-compression].

5.2.  Routing

   Nodes N10 to N19 advertise the prefixes 2001:db8:a:NN00::/64 and
   2001:db8:b:NN00::/64, where NN is the node identifier, in the IGP.

5.3.  Case 1: Intra-domain Traffic Engineering

   Let us assume that a centralized controller programs N11 to classify
   the traffic from 2001:db8:a:1000:: to 2001:db8:a:1900:: into an SR
   Policy encoded through an IPv6 encapsulation with:

   *  IPv6

      -  Source address 2001:db8:a:1100::

      -  Destination address 2001:db8:b:1200:1300:1400:1500:1600

      -  Next Header = 43 (Routing header)

   *  SRH

      -  Segment List < 2001:db8:b:1200:1300:1400:1500:1600,
         2001:db8:b:1700:1800:: >

      -  Segments Left = 1

      -  Next Header = 41 (IPv6)

   For illustration purposes, we use SID allocation that allows for a
   straightforward human reading of a compressed segment list.  Indeed,
   < 2001:db8:b:1200:1300:1400:1500:1600, 2001:db8:b:1700:1800:: >
   means: within the domain 2001:db8:b::, go first through node N12 then
   N13, N14, N15, and N16, then retrieve the next segment list entry
   from the SRH and go through node N17 before decapsulating the packet
   at node N18.

   This is compliant with the RFC 8986 because the SID meets the
   Locator:Function:Argument format definition (section 3.1 of RFC
   8986).  For example, the packet sent by node N11 has a destination
   address 2001:db8:b:1200:1300:1400:1500:1600 where 2001:db8:b:1200/64
   is the Locator and 0x1300140015001600 is the Argument.

   A packet in transit towards a given SID (e.g.
   2001:db8:b:1200:1300:1400:1500:1600), is forwarded by transit nodes
   via a longest-match lookup on the destination address of the packet.
   This results in a match of the SID locator (in this case,
   2001:db8:b:1200::/64), the transit node then forwards the packet
   accordingly.  The SID function and argument bits are opaque to
   transit nodes.  The function is only identified at the SR segment
   endpoint node (represented by the SID locator in the destination
   address) which further processes the argument.

   Also note the source N11 performs IPv6 header encapsulation with SRH,
   and the selected SID list containing function/arguments to be
   processed at some endpoints, because we are in a source routed domain
   within a secured SR domain.

   The remainder of this section details the packet journey.

   The packet Px transmitted by a node Nn is identified as "@Nn Px".

   @N10 P1:(IPv6 2001:db8:a:1000::, 2001:db8:a:1900::)

   N11 (as programmed by the centralized controller) encapsulates the
   packet P1 and submits the updated packet (P2) to the IPv6 module for
   transmission.  It performs an IP lookup on the destination address,
   matching an entry for the prefix 2001:db8:b:1200::/64 advertised by
   N21.  N11 forwards the packet on its shortest path towards to node
   N12.

@N11 P2:(IPv6 2001:db8:a:1100::, 2001:db8:b:1200:1300:1400:1500:1600)
        (SRH 2001:db8:b:1700:1800::, 2001:db8:b:1200:1300:1400:1500:1600; SL=1)
        (IPv6 2001:db8:a:1000::, 2001:db8:a:1900::)

   The transit nodes between N11 and N12 forward P1 as per their route
   2001:db8:b:1200::/64 to N12.  Similarly, the transit nodes between
   each subsequent pair of consecutive SR segment endpoint nodes
   forwards the packet as per their IPv6 routes for the destination
   address.  Those transit nodes are plain IPv6 routers with the plain
   IPv6 dataplane, they do not need to have any knowledge of SRv6.

   The hop limit of packet P1 is decremented at every transit node and
   every SR segment endpoint node.

   When the packet reaches the first SR segment endpoint node N12 (i.e.,
   the first TE waypoint), this performs a longest-prefix-match lookup
   on the IPv6 destination address.  This lookup returns a FIB entry
   that represents a locally instantiated SRv6 SID bound to the End
   behavior with the NEXT-C-SID flavor.  N12 processes the packet
   accordingly, resulting in a new destination address.  It then submits
   the updated packet to the IPv6 module for transmission.  This
   triggers an IP lookup on the destination address, matching an entry
   for the prefix 2001:db8:b:1300::/64 advertised by N13.  The packet is
   forwarded on the shortest path towards N13.

@N12 P2:(IPv6 2001:db8:a:1100::, 2001:db8:b:1300:1400:1500:1600:0000)

        (IPv6 2001:db8:a:1000::, 2001:db8:a:1900::)

   The subsequent SR segment endpoint nodes N13 to N17 process the
   packet similarly.

        (IPv6 2001:db8:a:1000::, 2001:db8:a:1900::)

   When the packet is processed by the SR segment endpoint node N16, the
   SID argument value is 0.  As per the pseudocode of the End behavior
   with the NEXT-C-SID and USD flavors, N16 retrieves the next SID by
   decrementing the value of segments left in the SRH and copying the
   next entry from the SRH segment list into the destination address.

        (IPv6 2001:db8:a:1000::, 2001:db8:a:1900::)

   When the packet reaches the final SR segment endpoint node N18, both
   the SID argument value and the segments left value in the SRH are 0.
   As per the pseudocode of the End behavior with the NEXT-C-SID and USD
   flavors, N18 decapsulates the packet and sends the inner packet P1
   towards its destination 2001:db8:a:1900::.

5.4.  Case 2: ICMPv6 error generation at a transit node

   Let us assume in the previous example that the hop limit expires on a
   transit node N141, located on the path between the SR segment
   endpoint nodes N14 and N15.

   The packet sent by node N14 is as follows (reproduced from the
   previous section).

@N14 P2:(IPv6 2001:db8:a:1100::, 2001:db8:b:1500:1600:0000:0000:0000)

        (IPv6 2001:db8:a:1000::, 2001:db8:a:1900::)

   Node N141 generates an ICMPv6 time exceeded error message as follows.

          (ICMPv6 time exceeded error

   Node N11 receives the ICMP error packet transmitted by N141.
   Section 5.4 of RFC8754 indicates that a destination address of the
   invoking packet is determined by looking at segment list[0].

5.5.  Case 3: Ping a SID

   The operator wants to ping the End with NEXT-C-SID flavor SID
   2001:db8:b:1200:: of N12 from the SR source node N10.

   The ICMP echo request is sent by N10 as follows.

   @N10 P1:(IPv6 2001:db8:a:1000::, 2001:db8:b:1200::)
           (ICMPv6 echo request)

   This results in an ICMP echo reply from N12 to N10.

   @N12 P2:(IPv6 2001:db8:b:1200::, 2001:db8:a:1000::)
           (ICMPv6 echo reply)
