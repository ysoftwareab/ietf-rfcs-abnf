1. Introduction

   Currently many organizations are working on location-related
   technologies, and how to express and provide location information to
   services and applications in the Internet. Such organizations are
   IETF, OpenGIS, 3GPP, LIF, WAP Forum, W3C, etc.

   Each of them basically specifies its own way of providing and
   expressing location information to services and applications. This
   raises a serious problem - the various location information formats,
   services, and applications will not be interoperable in the Internet.
   Therefore, a common way of expressing location information for
   services and applications in the Internet is needed.

   One way of reaching interoperability is to have a common data set to
   express spatial location information with in the Internet. This draft
   proposes such a set. The design aims at bridging various
   existing/proposed data representation formats, as well as meeting the
   requirements of existing/proposed location-aware services.

   A more general framework enabling interoperability is presented in
   the draft "Spatial Location Payload" <draft-korkea-aho-spatial-
   location-payload-00.txt>. The payload allows the combination of
   several location data sets. It enables e.g., the common spatial
   location data set to be extended with application specific elements,
   or to express the same location in different ways.


2. Existing Spatial Location Expressions

   There are many existing or proposed location expressions from a
   number of organizations (e.g. IETF, OpenGIS, 3GPP, LIF, WAP Forum,
   and W3C). Some of them are listed below:

   - Expression standardized for GSM and UMTS to be used internally in
     the mobile networks (called here "3GPP") [1]

   - An interface towards mobile networks in consideration by LIF [2]

   - The Geography Markup Language by the OpenGIS Consortium (GML) [3]

   - NaVigation Markup Language (NVML) [4] and Point Of Interest
     eXchange Language (POIX) [5] submitted to the W3C

Korkea-aho, Tang, Racz, Polk, and Takahashi                    [Page 2]

Internet Draft    A Common Spatial Location Data Set           May 2001



   - GeoTags for HTML resource discovery [6,7]

   - National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) interface and
     protocol [8] often used by GPS receivers

   - VCard and ICalendar [9, 10, 11] include elements to specify
     position

   - A Means for Expressing Location Information in the Domain Name
     System(DNS-LOC) [12]

   - Proposed Simple Text Format for the Spatial Location Protocol
    (SLoP) [13]

   In brief most of the formats express location with latitude,
   longitude, using WGS84 as reference datum. GML, LIF, NAVML, and POIX
   also enable expressions using other coordinate systems and reference
   datum. Some allow altitude, if the data is available. In the location
   expressions, altitude usually means the height above WGS84 reference
   ellipsoid, while it is unclear in some cases.

   Most of the formats focus on the specification of the location of a
   point object, whereas others include also the expression of object
   shapes (3GPP, LIF, and GML). In DNS-LOC and NVML radial size of
   object can be defined.

   When the accuracy for estimating a location is defined, it is mostly
   expressed as horizontal and vertical error. Though, the 3GPP proposal
   includes more complex accuracy descriptions.

   LIF, POIX, NMEA, and 3GPP include also fields for velocity/speed. It
   is expressed as horizontal speed in all the cases except 3GPP. The
   3GPP proposal defines horizontal velocity (horizontal speed +
   bearing) and vertical velocity (vertical speed + vertical direction).

   Direction of movement is also included in LIF, POIX, and NMEA, using
   true and/or magnetic North. POIX and NMEA include possibility to
   define the course as well.


3. Location Information Required by Services

   Many different types of location-aware services have been identified,
   e.g. information services (e.g. yellow pages, point-of-interest
   services), navigation & guidance, notifications (ads, traffic alerts,
   weather services, etc.), information memorizing & association,
   tracking & resource management, authorization, location specific
   resource management and discovery, location sensitive billing,
   network management.


Korkea-aho, Tang, Racz, Polk, and Takahashi                    [Page 3]

Internet Draft    A Common Spatial Location Data Set           May 2001


   It appears that most of the different services will primarily need
   absolute spatial location information as input. This is also the
   format that most existing location measurement systems can provide.
   Some of the services also need descriptive location such as
   addresses, regions, etc. This kind of information is generally
   created by manual input or via transformation services.

   Altitude and accuracy information will bring added value to services,
   but most of them can live without it. It is quite evident that in
   addition to location information it is important to attach the time
   of measurement to the location. This can be essential to the
   processing and management of location information. Other information
   that could bring added value to services include the orientation of
   the object, its moving direction, intended course, and speed.

   What about the size and shape of the object? This information could
   principally be used in two ways; firstly to describe the object which
   is positioned in order to determine what region it is covering (e.g.
   in finding, guidance, notification, tracking, authorization, resource
   discovery, billing and management services), secondly to indicate the
   region of interest or object to attach information to (finding
   information and information memorizing & association). Since most of
   the objects for positioning are of minor size (<10 m), the size and
   shape of an object usually do not have significance for the location
   of the object. It is also difficult to express shapes and sizes in an
   interoperable way. In fact, size and shape can be understood and
   specified as attributes associated to a location rather than location
   itself.


4. Common Location Data Set

4.1 The Elements of the Data Set

   The proposal of a common data set is based on identified elements
   important to applications, and on the available data from different
   devices and interfaces.

   Coordinates and Datum (mandatory)

   When reviewing the various existing interfaces and data
   representation formats, we find that most of them support coordinates
   expressed in latitude, longitude, and altitude (optional) using WGS-
   84 datum. Thus we propose to use these in the common data set, where
   latitude and longitude would be mandatory. In order to keep the
   common data set simple, no other datum or coordinate systems are
   supported. We have chosen to enable the optional altitude to be
   expressed both as the WGS-84 reference ellipsoid and mean sea level
   as reference.



Korkea-aho, Tang, Racz, Polk, and Takahashi                    [Page 4]

Internet Draft    A Common Spatial Location Data Set           May 2001


   Location Accuracy (optional)

   Location accuracy is the estimation/measurement error of a location.
   The different interfaces include different types of accuracy
   information. We propose to include the most common way to express
   this, i.e. horizontal accuracy, by circle of radius from the
   positioned point, and height accuracy, by range from the positioned
   point.

   Time (mandatory)

   Time is the time of a measurement/fix of a location of an object. It
   is an important factor for location information. With the help of the
   time it is easier to manage location information and it enables
   different kinds of approximations. It is a mandatory element.

   Speed (optional)

   Speed is indicated as horizontal ground and vertical speed. This
   expression is chosen because many systems are able to indicate
   horizontal ground and vertical speed.

   Direction (optional)

   Direction indicates the direction of movement. It is expressed in a
   2-dimensional (horizontal) frame indicated by the magnetic (or true)
   North.

   Course (optional)

   Course indicates the direction from the current position to a defined
   destination. It is expressed in a 2-dimensional (horizontal) frame
   indicated by the magnetic (or true) North.

   Orientation (optional)

   Orientation describes the orientation of the positioned object.
   Orientation is often given with a local coordinate system as
   reference.

   Since this reference frame can be different for different objects, it
   will be difficult to make a common expression based on this. One
   possibility would be to attach an object type indicating directly the
   used reference framework. Instead of such a solution, we propose a
   method where the orientation is expressed in a 2-dimensional
   (horizontal) frame indicated by the magnetic (or true) North, and a
   vertical element expressed by the angle between horizontal plane and
   the main axis of the object.

4.2 Syntax of the Elements

   Some of the existing data formats allow different optional ways to
   express the data elements and include syntax information. However, in
   order to keep processing as simple as possible we prefer only one
   single way of expression. The syntax of the elements in the common
   data set is as follows (For more details see ABNF notation in
   Appendix A and formatting details in Appendix B).

4.3 Encoding of the Elements

   The data elements can be encoded in many different ways, e.g., text
   based attribute-value pairs, binary, MIME, XML, etc. In order to
   enable interoperability, again, we need a common way of encoding the
   parameters. We propose XML. The advantages of XML are that the
   encoding is easily understandable, human readable, and standard tools
   and parsers can be used. In addition to this, many of the other
   proposals make use of XML. A possible disadvantage of using XML is
   that it is quite verbose.

4.3.1 XML DTD for the Data Set

   The XML DTD for the common data set is:

   <!-- slo_default.dtd -->
   <!ELEMENT SLO (POS, ALT?, ALT_MSL?, H_ACC?, V_ACC?, TIME, G_SPEED?,
   V_SPEED?, DIR?, COURSE?, H_ORIENT?, V_ORIENT?)>
   <!ELEMENT POS (LAT, LONG)>
   <!ELEMENT LAT (#PCDATA)>
   <!ELEMENT LONG (#PCDATA)>
   <!-- Altitude -->
   <!ELEMENT ALT (#PCDATA)>
   <!ELEMENT ALT_MSL (#PCDATA)>
   <!-- Location Accuracy -->
   <!ELEMENT H_ACC (#PCDATA)>
   <!ELEMENT V_ACC (#PCDATA)>
   <!-- Time -->
   <!ELEMENT TIME (#PCDATA)>
   <!-- Speed -->
   <!ELEMENT G_SPEED (#PCDATA)>
   <!ATTLIST G_SPEED unit (ms|kmh|mph|knot) "ms">
   <!ELEMENT V_SPEED (#PCDATA)>
   <!ATTLIST V_SPEED unit (ms|kmh|mph|knot) "ms">
   <!-- Direction -->
   <!ELEMENT DIR (#PCDATA)>
   <!-- Course -->
   <!ELEMENT COURSE (#PCDATA)>
   <!-- Orientation -->
   <!ELEMENT H_ORIENT (#PCDATA)>
   <!ELEMENT V_ORIENT (#PCDATA)>


4.3.2 XML Schema for the Data Set

   XML Schemas provide a means for defining the structure, content and
   semantics of XML documents more precisely than the DTDs. With help of
   the XML Schema we can express the constraints on the different data
   elements better. Below is the XML-Schema for the common spatial
   location data set.

4.4 An XML-encoded Location Example

   Here is an example of a location described using the common location
   data set and its XML Schema:

   <?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>
   <loc:SLO xmlns:loc="http://www-nrc.nokia.com/ietf-
   spatial/2001/05/08/location"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://www-nrc.nokia.com/ietf-
   spatial/2001/05/08/location http://www-nrc.nokia.com/ietf-
   spatial/2001/05/08/location.xsd">
     <POS>
       <LAT>N60.08.00.235556</LAT>
       <LONG>E025.00.00</LONG>
     </POS>
     <ALT>+12.99</ALT>
     <ALT_MSL>010</ALT_MSL>
     <H_ACC>50</H_ACC>
     <V_ACC>2.5</V_ACC>

     <TIME>2001-01-01T12:00:01+02:00</TIME>
     <G_SPEED>2.0</G_SPEED>
     <V_SPEED unit="knot">1</V_SPEED>
     <DIR>M240</DIR>

     <V_ORIENT>179</V_ORIENT>
   </loc:SLO>


5. Extendibility of the Data Set

   The common spatial location data set includes only a specific set of
   elements with clearly defined contents (The element "un-specified
   attributes" existing in the previous version was removed from the
   data set). In this manner we can keep the data set unambiguous and
   unique. This simplifies transformation and validation of the data
   set.

   XML Schema [16] provides general extension mechanisms with which SLO
   or elements of it can be incorporated in other data sets.

   However, in order to simplify transformation and processing of the
   different data sets, we recommend that application specific
   extensions should be defined as own data sets and attached to the
   common location data set as described in the draft "Spatial Location
   Payload" [17].


6. Security Considerations

   Location alone usually means nothing but a "point" somewhere.
   However, when associated with a meaningful target such as a person,
   the location is potentially private or sensitive even though some
   parties may like to release their location information to the public.

   The authors believe that there must be security and policy mechanisms
   available to protect the information whenever needed. These issues
   are, however, out of the scope of the definition of a common location
   data set. We let the location-dealing applications or protocols
   define or select their own specific security mechanisms for
   authorization, authentication, encryption, key exchange, etc.
