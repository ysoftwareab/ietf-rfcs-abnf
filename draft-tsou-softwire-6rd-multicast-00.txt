Internet-Draft           IPv6 Multicast With 6rd            January 2011


1.  Introduction

   6rd ([RFC5569], [RFC5969]) provides a means to connect IPv6 hosts to
   the IPv6 Internet across an IPv4 provider network.  Unicast traffic
   is carried through IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels.  It is possible to carry
   multicast traffic from the IPv6 network through the IPv4 network in
   the same way, but if multiple customers wish access to the same
   multicast channels, the failure to use the native multicast
   capabilities of the IPv4 network wastes resources in that network.

   This document describes a solution use the native multicast
   capabilities of the IPv4 network to acquire and forward multicast
   traffic from IPv6 Internet to an IPv6 host attached to the IPv4
   network.  Typically this solution will operate in combination with
   6rd for unicast traffic.  However, no IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling is
   required for signalling, only the ability to interwork between IPv4
   and IPv6 at the 6rd Customer Equipment (6rd CE) and the 6rd Border
   Relay (BR).

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Description of the Solution

   A number of problems have to be solved to allow an IPv6 host attached
   to an IPv4 network to request and receive a multicast stream
   originating in a neighbouring IPv6 network and passing through the
   IPv4 network using the native multicast facilities of that network.
   These problems are described in detail in the course of presenting
   proposed solutions to them.

2.1.  Assumed Architecture

   This document assumes an architecture similar to that of 6rd
   [RFC5569], [RFC5969], with additional capabilities for the 6rd CE and
   the 6rd Border Relay.  In addition, it postulates a multicast source
   discovery and translation function, which MAY be collocated with the
   BR.  See Figure 1.

     Figure 1: IPv6 Multicast Across an IPv4 Domain Using a Translator
                                 Function

   In addition to its 6rd responsibilities, the 6rd CE is responsible
   for:

   o  requesting a mapping between IPv6 <Source, Group> pairs presented
      by the IPv6 Host and IPv4 <Source, Group> pairs valid for the
      provider's IPv4 network;

   o  interworking between MLD [RFC3810] presented by the IPv6 Host and
      IGMP [RFC3376] forwarded toward the provider's IPv4 network;

   o  translating incoming IPv4 multicast streams to IPv6 before
      forwarding them to the IPv6 Host.

   The Provider IP Edge has the normal function of interworking between
   IGMP [RFC3376] and PIM [RFC4601] multicast signalling.

   The Border Relay has the usual 6rd responsibilities.  In addition, it
   is responsible for:

   o  requesting a mapping between IPv4 <Source, Group> pairs received
      in PIM messages from the IPv4 network and IPv6 <Source, Group>
      pairs valid for the neighbouring IPv6 network;

   o  translating PIM messaging between the IPv4 and IPv6 networks;

   o  using the reverse mapping from IPv6 to IPv4 <Source, Group> pairs
      to translate and forward multicast media streams coming from the
      IPv6 network.

   The Translator function has the following responsibilities:

   o  creating a mapping between IPv6 and IPv4 <Source, Group> address
      pairs for multicast streams, beginning with IPv6 address pairs
      provided in requests from the 6rd CE and assigning the
      corresponding IPv4 unicast and multicast addresses from pool of

      addresses with which it is configured.

   o  responding to requests for mappings in either direction.

2.2.  Steps In the Proposed Solution

   1.  Initial discovery and Join request

   The IPv6 Host discovers the <Source, Group> address pair of a
   multicast stream the user wants to receive.  The discovery is by
   means outside the scope of this specification (e.g., via the web).
   The IPv6 Host sends an MLDv2 [RFC3810] request to the 6rd CE to
   acquire the stream.

         MLD/IPv6

                                 Figure 2

   2. <Source, Group> Address Mapping At 6rd CE

   The 6rd CE checks its cache of mappings to see if it already has a
   mapping between the IPv6 <Source, Group> address pair received in the
   MLD request and a corresponding pair of IPv4 addresses.  Failing to
   find a mapping, it sends a request for the required mapping to the
   Translator.  The Translator in turn checks whether it has already
   created the mapping.  If not, it assigns unicast and multicast IPv4
   addresses from its pool and records the mapping for further use.  In
   either case it returns the requested mapping to the 6rd CE, which
   caches it.  [Editor's Note: The transaction is carried out over a
   protocol to be specified in a later version of this document.]

   3.  Propagation Of the Join Request Into the IPv4 Network

   The 6rd CE interworks between the MLDv2 request it received and an

   IGMPv3 [RFC3376] request which it forwards to the Provider IP Edge.
   It uses the address pair mapping it received from the Translator as
   part of this interworking.

   The Provider IP Edge acts on the IGMP request by forwarding a PIM
   [RFC3973] or [RFC4601] request into the IPv4 network, indicating the
   IPv4 <Source, Group> address pair it was given and ensuring that it
   is on the multicast tree for the stream concerned.  [Editor's note:
   details later.]

   Eventually the PIM request finds its way to the 6rd Border Relay.
   [Editor's note: details needed here to make sure this happens.
   Alternatively, we could recast this as using any Border Router and
   not a 6rd Relay in particular, but we would end up with possibly
   different paths for the multicast packets and the returning unicast
   RTCP feedback.  Maybe that doesn't matter.]

                                 Figure 4

   4.  Remapping the <Source, Group> Address Pair At the 6rd BR

   The 6rd BR needs to map from the IPv4 <Source, Group> address pair it
   received back to the corresponding IPv6 address pair before
   propagating the PIM request into the IPv6 network.  It sends a
   request to the Translator to provide that mapping.  The Translator
   already has this mapping, as a result of the original 6rd CE request,
   and returns it to the 6rd BR.  [Editor's note: protocol again to be
   specified later.  It can probably be the same as the one used by the
   6rd CE, since both nodes are operator-managed even if the 6rd CE is
   more likely to have been hacked.  Have to work out the security
   considerations.]

   5.  Propagation Of the PIM Request Into the IPv6 Network

   The 6rd BR propagates translates the PIM request from IPv4 to IPv6
   using the mapping it received.  It propagates the request into the
   IPv6 network to complete the construction of the path for the
   requested multicast stream.  [Editor's note: probably don't have to
   go this far if there are already other listeners attached to the IPv4
   network.  Have to insert corresponding text in previous steps.  Also,
   if PIM can return errors, the 6rd BR should notify the Translator so
   it can mark the IPv6 address pair as bad (so it doesn't get remapped)
   while releasing the assigned IPv4 addresses.]

   6.  Transport of Multicast Media and Unicast RTCP Feedback

   If the 6rd BR receives a multicast packet from the IPv6 network, it
   translates the source and group addresses to IPv4 using the mapping
   it has retained from Step 4.  It then forwards it to the next hop in
   the multicast tree for that stream.

                                 Figure 7

   When the 6rd CE receives a multicast packet from the IPv4 network, it
   translates the packet to IPv4 using the mapping which it has retained
   from Step 2.

   When the IPv6 Host sends unicast RTCP [RFC3550] feedback toward the
   source, the packets are treated by the 6rd CE and 6rd BR like any
   other unicast packets.  That is, they are encapsulated at the 6rd CE,
   transported across the IPv4 network as IPv6-in-IPv4, and decapsulated
   at the 6rd BR before forwarding into the IPv6 network.

   Finally, if the IPv6 Host emits multicast packets destined for an
   any-source multicast group, the 6rd CE and 6rd BR translate the
   packets from IPv6 to IPv4 and back again using the mappings they have
   retained.
