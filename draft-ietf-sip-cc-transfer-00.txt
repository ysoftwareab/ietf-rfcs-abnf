1  Overview 
   
  This document defines a SIP [2] extension and details its use to 
  provide Call Transfer capabilities. This is part of a family of Call 
  Control extensions described in the Call Control Framework document 
  [3].  
   
  The mechanisms discussed here are most closely related to traditional 
  unattended and consultation hold transfers. Discussion of attended 
  transfer (where all parties are briefly in a conference) is deferred 
  until the conferencing features in this framework are addressed. 
   
  This work has roots in draft-ietf-sip-cc-01 [4] but some basic 
  semantics are different. In particular, transfers are achieved through 
  a new method that does not terminate the original signaling 
  relationship. By disassociating transfers from the processing of BYE, 
  these changes facilitate recovery of failed transfers and clarify 
  state management in the participating entities. 
   
  Implementers that started with the sip-cc-01 BYE-ALSO technique for 
  blind-transfer should find it straightforward to migrate to the 
  mechanisms set forth here. 

2  Changes from draft-sparks-sip-cc-transfer-00 
   
  . The method was renamed to reflect its function instead of this 
    particular application of its function. TRANSFER and Transfer-To 
    became REFER and Refer-To. REFER was generalized to support URLs 
    beyond those indicating SIP INVITEs. 
  . A Require header is no longer required. Bodies are allowed. 
  . Copying Call-ID from the request was replaced by using a Refer-To: 
    URL containing any headers that should be use. 
  . Added a way for the identity specified in Refer-To: to know it has 
    been referred to. 
  . Added a mechanism to prove the identity of the issuer of the REFER 
    to the identity specified in Refer-To. 
  . The failure response returned to an attempted REFER has been 
    changed from 603 to 503 to facilitate different behavior in the 
    cases of "I won't accept that REFER" and "I tried that REFER and it 
    failed" with Retry-After: support for the later.

3  Actors and Roles 
   
  There are three actors in a given transfer event, each playing one of 
  the following roles: 
   
     Transferee -      the party being transferred to the Transfer 
                       Target. 
   
     Transferor -      the party initiating the transfer  
   
     Transfer Target - the new party being introduced into a call with 
                       the Transferee. 
   
  The following roles are used to describe transfer requirements and 
  scenarios: 
   
     Originator -  wishes to place a call to the Recipient. This actor 
                   is the source of the first INVITE in a session, to 
                   either a Facilitator or a Screener. 
   
     Facilitator - receives a call or out-of-band request from the 
                   Originator, establishes a call to the Recipient 
                   through the Screener, and connects the Originator to 
                   the Recipient. 
   
     Screener -    receives a call ultimately intended for the Recipient 
                   and transfers the calling party to the Recipient if 
                   appropriate. 
   
     Recipient -   the party the Originator is ultimately connected to.

4  Requirements 
   
    1. Any party in a SIP session MUST be able to transfer any other 
       party in that session at any point in that session. 
   
    2. The Transferor and the Transferee MUST NOT be removed from a 
       session as part of a transfer transaction. 
   
          At first glance, requirement 2 may seem to indicate 
          that the user experience in a transfer must be 
          significantly different from what a current PBX or 
          Centrex user expects. As the call-flows in this 
          document show, this is not the case. A client MAY 
          preserve the current experience. In fact, without 
          this requirement, some forms of the current 
          experience (ringback on unattended transfer failure 
          for instance) will be lost. 
   
    3. The Transferor MUST know whether or not the transfer was 
       successful (this is significantly different from the requirements 
       of draft-ietf-sip-cc-01).

5  The REFER Method 
   
  REFER is a SIP method as defined by [2]. The REFER method indicates 
  that the recipient should contact a third party using the contact 
  information provided in the method. A success response indicates that 
  the recipient was able to contact the third party. The REFER method 
  follows the session's current signaling path. In particular, the 
  Request-URI of the REFER method identifies the recipient. 
   
  Unless stated otherwise, the protocol for emitting and responding to a 
  REFER request are identical to those for a BYE request in [2]. The 
  behavior of SIP entities not implementing the REFER (or any other 
  unknown) method is explicitly defined in [2] and is not discussed 
  further here. 

5.1 The Refer-To Header 
   
  Refer-To is a request-header as defined by [2]. It may only appear in 
  a REFER request. It identifies the transfer target. 

     Refer-To = "Refer-To" ":" URL 
   
  A REFER method MUST contain exactly one Refer-To header. 
   
  The Refer-To header MAY be encrypted as part of end-end encryption. 
   
  The Refer-To header has no short form. 
   
          The Contact header is an important part of the 
          Route/Record-Route mechanism and is not available 
          for this task.

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-00.txt           July 2000 

   

5.2 The Referred-By Header 

 Referred-By is a request-header as defined by [2]. It can appear in 
 any request. It conveys the identity of the original REFERrer to the 
 referred-to party, optionally proving the identity and that the 
 REFERrer actually issued this reference. 

  
     Referred-By      = "Referred-By" ":" referrer-url referenced-url 
                        [ref-signature] 
     referrer-url     = SIP-URL 
     referenced-url   = URL 
     ref-signature    = signature-scheme #sig-scheme-params 
     signature-scheme = token 
     sig-scheme-parms = token "=" ( token | quoted-string ) 

 The referrer-url contains the SIP URL of the party sending the REFER 
 request. The referenced-url contains a copy of the URL placed in the 
 Refer-To: header. The ref-signature contains a signature over the 
 concatenation of referrer-url and referenced-url.  An example 
 signature scheme is given in section 5.2.1. 

 A REFER request MUST contain exactly one Referred-By header. 

 The Referred-By header SHOULD be signed to help detection of REFERs 
 from unauthorized third parties. A signed Referred-By header SHOULD 
 include a Date header in the referrer-url to facilitate detection of 
 replay attacks. 

 A UA MAY reject a request containing an unsigned Referred-By header. A 
 UA SHOULD verify the signature on any Referred-By header it receives.  

 The Referred-By header MAY be encrypted as part of end-end encryption. 

 The Referred-By header has no short form. 

5.2.1 A PGP based signature-scheme 
   
  One signature-scheme for Referred-By headers uses PGP as follows: 
   
     Referred-By          = "Referred-By" ":" referrer-url  
                            referenced-url "pgp" pgp-sig-scheme-parms 
     pgp-sig-scheme-parms = pgp-version | signed-by | pgp-signature 
   
  pgp-version, signed-by and pgp-signature are defined in section 15.1.2 
  of RFC2543, with the modification that the signature is computed 
  across the concatenation of the referrer-url and the referenced-url.

5.3 Header Field Support for the REFER Method 
   
  This table adds a column to tables 4 and 5 in [2], describing header 
  presence in a REFER method. See [2] for a key for the symbols used. A 
  row for the Refer-To: and Referred-By request-header should be 
  inferred, each mandatory for REFER. Refer-To is not applicable for all 
  other methods. Referred-By is a general Request header. The enc and e-
  e columns in [2] apply to the REFER method unmodified.

5.4 Message Body Inclusion 
   
  A REFER method may contain a body which SHOULD be processed according 
  to its Content-Type. 
   

5.5 Responses to the REFER Method 
   
  An agent responding to a REFER Method MUST return a 400 Bad Request if 
  the request contained zero or more than one Refer-To headers. An agent 
  responding to a REFER Method MUST return a 400 Bad Request if the 
  request contained zero or more than one Referred-By headers. An agent 
  (including proxies generating local responses) MAY return a 100 Trying 
  or any appropriate 400-600 class response as prescribed by [2]. If the 
  recipient's agent decides to contact the resource in the Refer-To 
  header, a 200 OK response MUST be returned if it the contact was 
  successful, otherwise a 503 Service Unavailable MUST be returned. The 
  503 response MAY contain a Retry-After: header indicating when the 
  REFER may be attempted again.  
           
          The original proposal called for a 603 response if 
          the REFER was attempted but failed. This left no way 
          for the referrer to tell whether the recipient tried 
          and failed, or just refused to try. A 603 Decline 
          now means the recipient refuses to try. A 503 can 
          mean either "I tried and failed" or "I'm broken and 
          couldn't try". In either case, if a Retry-After 
          header is present, the request can be attempted 
          again.

5.6 Behavior of SIP User Agents 
   
  A UA receiving a well-formed REFER request SHOULD request approval 
  from the user to proceed (this request could be interactive or through 
  configuration). Upon receiving approval from the user, the UA MUST 
  contact the resource identified by the URL in the Refer-To: header. 
  Note that if the URL is a SIP URL, it could contain header fields such 
  as Call-Id that will be used to form the resulting request. If the URL 
  is a SIP URL, the Referred-By header in the REFER request should be 
  copied into the request sent to the referred-to resource. In 
  accordance with [2], the UA SHOULD issue a provisional response to the 
  REFER method if it cannot issue a final response within 200ms of its 
  receipt. The appropriate response to issue to the REFER on receipt of 
  a final response from the referred-to resource is discussed in 
  "Responses to the REFER Method". 
   
  A REFER request is meaningful only in the context of an existing 
  session. A UA receiving a REFER request for an unknown call leg MUST 
  return a 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist and MUST NOT contact 
  the resource identified by that request's Refer-To header as part of 
  the REFER transaction. 
   

5.7 Behavior of SIP Registrars/Redirect Servers 
   
  Since REFER has meaning only in the context of an existing session, a 
  Registrar or Redirect Server that is not also playing the role of a 
  User Agent (never issues a 200 OK in response to an INVITE) MUST 
  respond to a REFER request with a 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not 
  Exist. 

5.8 Behavior of SIP Proxies 
   
  SIP Proxies do not require modification to support the REFER method. 
  Specifically, as required by [2], a proxy should process a REFER 
  request the same way it processes an OPTIONS request.

5.9 Security Considerations 
   
  The security requirements of [2] apply to the REFER method. 
   
  This mechanism relies on providing contact information for the 
  referred-to resource to the party being referred (the transfer-target 
  and transferee in a transfer). Care should be taken to provide a 
  suitably restricted URI if the referred to resource should be 
  protected. 
   
  Care should be taken when implementing the logic that determines 
  whether or not to accept the REFER request. A UA not capable of 
  accessing non-SIP URLs SHOULD NOT accept REFER requests to them. 
  Unless the UA has good reason (perhaps as part of an as yet undefined 
  application), it SHOULD NOT accept REFERences to SIP URLs for methods 
  other than INVITE.  

6  Using REFER to achieve Call Transfer 
   
  A REFER can be issued by the Transferor to cause the Transferee to 
  issue an INVITE to the Transfer-Target. Note that a successful REFER 
  transaction does not terminate the session between the Transferor and 
  the Transferee. If those parties wish to terminate their session, they 
  must do so with a subsequent BYE request. The media negotiated between 
  the transferee and the transfer target is not affected by the media 
  that had been negotiated between the transferor and the transferee. In 
  particular, the INVITE issued by the Transferee will have the same SDP 
  body it would have if he Transferee had initiated that INVITE on its 
  own. Further, the disposition of the media streams between the 
  Transferor and the Transferee is not altered by the REFER method. 
  Agents may alter a session's media through additional signaling. For 
  example, they may make use of the SIP hold re-INVITE [2] or the 
  conferencing extensions provided by this framework. 
   

6.1 Unattended Transfer 
   
  Unattended Transfer consists of the Transferor providing the Transfer 
  Target's contact to the Transferee. The Transferee attempts to 
  establish a session using that contact and reports the results of that 
  attempt to the Transferor. The signaling relationship between the 
  Transferor and Transferee is not terminated, so the call is   
  recoverable if the Transfer Target cannot be reached. Note that the 
  Transfer Target's contact information has been exposed to the

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-00.txt           July 2000 

  Transferee. The provided contact can be used to make new calls in the 
  future. 
   
  The diagrams below show indicate the first line of each message. All 
  messages in a particular diagram share the same Call-ID. In these 
  diagrams, media is managed through reINVITE holds, but using other 
  mechanisms (mixing multiple media streams at the UA or using the

6.2 Unattended Transfer with Consultation Hold 
   
  Transfer with Consultation Hold involves a session between the 
  transferor and the transfer target before the transfer actually takes 
  place. This is implemented with SIP Hold and Unattended Transfer as 
  described above. 
   

6.2.1 Variation 1 : Exposes transfer target 
   
  The transferor places the transferee on hold, establishes a call with 
  the transfer target to alert them to the impending transfer, 
  terminates the connection with the transfer target, then proceeds with 
  unattended transfer as above. This variation can be used to provide an 
  experience similar to that expected by current PBX and Centrex users. 
   
  To (hopefully) improve clarity, non-REFER transactions have been 
  collapsed into one indicator with the arrow showing the direction of 
  the request.

  5.2.2     Variation 2 : Protects transfer target 
   
  The transferor places the transferee on hold, establishes a call with 
  the transfer target and then reverses their roles, transferring the 
  original transfer target to the original transferee. This has the 
  advantage of hiding information about the original transfer target 
  from the original transferee. On the other hand, the Transferee's 
  experience is different that in current systems. The Transferee is 
  effectively "called back" by the Transfer Target.

6.3 Attended Transfer 
   
  In an attended transfer, the three actors participate in an ad-hoc 
  conference as part of the event. Discussion of the implementation of 
  attended transfer is thus deferred until the conferencing portion of 
  the Call Control framework has been addressed.

6.4 Transfer with multiple parties 
   
  In this example the Originator places call to the Facilitator who 
  reaches the Recipient through the Screener. The Recipient's contact 
  information is exposed to the Facilitator and the Originator. This 
  example is provided for clarification of the semantics of the REFER 
  method only and should not be used as the design of an   
  implementation.
