1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of the Camellia block cipher
   algorithm in Counter mode and Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) Mode , as an
   IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) mechanism to provide
   confidentiality, data origin authentication, and connectionless
   integrity.

   Camellia is a symmetric cipher with a Feistel structure.  Camellia
   was developed jointly by NTT and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in
   2000.  It was designed to withstand all known cryptanalytic attacks,
   and it has been scrutinized by worldwide cryptographic experts.
   Camellia is suitable for implementation in software and hardware,
   offering encryption speed in software and hardware implementations
   that is comparable to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [18].

   Camellia supports 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key
   lengths, i.e., the same interface specifications as the AES.
   Therefore, it is easy to implement Camellia based algorithms by
   replacing AES block of AES based algorithms to Camellia block.

   Camellia is adopted as IETF and several international standardization
   organizations.  Camellia is already adopted as IPSec [17], TLS [15],
   S/MIME [12] and XML [14].  Camellia is adopted for the one of three
   ISO/IEC international standard cipher [21] as 128bit block
   cipher(Camellia AES and SEED).  Camellia was selected as a
   recommended cryptographic primitive by the EU NESSIE (New European
   Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and Encryption) project [19] and
   was included in the list of cryptographic techniques for Japanese
   e-Government systems that was selected by the Japan CRYPTREC
   (Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees) [20].

   Since optimized source code is provided by several open source
   lisences [23], Camellia is also adopted by several open source
   projects.  Camellia is already adopted by Openssl.  Additional API
   for Network Security Services (NSS) and IPsec stack of Linux and Free
   BSD are prepared or working progress for release.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [5].  The Camellia homepage [24] contains a wealth of information
   about Camellia, including detailed specification, security analysis,
   performance figures, reference implementation, optimized
   implementetion, test vectors, and intellectual property information.

   The remainder of this document specifies the additional modes of
   operation Camellia within the context of IPsec ESP.  For further
   information on how the various pieces of ESP fit together to provide
   security services, please refer to [6] [7], and [3].

2.  The Camellia Cipher Algorithm

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics
   and variables, including mode, key size, weak keys, block size, and
   rounds.  The following sections contain descriptions of the relevant
   characteristics of Camellia.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [5].

2.1.  Key Size

   Camellia supports three key sizes: 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.
   The default key size is 128 bits, and all implementations MUST
   support this key size.  Implementations MAY also support key sizes of
   192 bits and 256 bits.

   Camellia uses a different number of rounds for each of the defined
   key sizes.  When a 128-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 18
   rounds.  When a 192-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 24
   rounds.  When a 256-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 24
   rounds.

2.2.  Weak Keys

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   Camellia.

2.3.  Block Size and Padding

   Camellia uses a block size of sixteen octets (128 bits).

   Padding is required by the algorithms to maintain a 16-octet (128-
   bit) block size.  Padding MUST be added, as specified in [7], such
   that the data to be encrypted (which includes the ESP Pad Length and
   Next Header fields) has a length that is a multiple of 16 octets.

   Because of the algorithm specific padding requirement, no additional
   padding is required to ensure that the ciphertext terminates on a
   4-octet boundary (i.e. maintaining a 16-octet block size guarantees
   that the ESP Pad Length and Next Header fields will be right aligned
   within a 4-octet word).  Additional padding MAY be included, as
   specified in [7], as long as the 16-octet block size is maintained.

2.4.  Performance

   Performance figures of Camellia are available at
   <http://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/crypt/camellia/>.  NESSIE project has

3.  Mode

   Camellia Counter mode (Camellia-CTR) and Camellia Counter with CBC-
   MAC (Camellia-CCM) are discussed in this specification.

   CCM is a generic authenticate-and-encrypt block cipher mode [4].  In
   this specification, CCM is used with the Camellia [5] block cipher.

3.1.  Counter

   Camellia-CTR requires the encryptor to generate a unique per-packet
   value, and communicate this value to the decryptor.  This
   specification calls this per-packet value an initialization vector
   (IV).  The same IV and key combination MUST NOT be used more than
   once.  The encryptor can generate the IV in any manner that ensures
   uniqueness.  Common approaches to IV generation include incrementing
   a counter for each packet and linear feedback shift registers
   (LFSRs).

   This specification calls for the use of a nonce for additional
   protection against precomputation attacks.  The nonce value need not
   be secret.  However, the nonce MUST be unpredictable prior to the
   establishment of the IPsec security association that is making use of
   Camellia-CTR.

   Camellia-CTR has many properties that make it an attractive
   encryption algorithm for in high-speed networking.  Camellia-CTR uses
   the Camellia block cipher to create a stream cipher.  Data is
   encrypted and decrypted by XORing with the key stream produced by
   Camellia encrypting sequential counter block values.  Camellia-CTR is
   easy to implement, and Camellia-CTR can be pipelined and
   parallelized.  Camellia-CTR also supports key stream precomputation.

   Pipelining is possible because Camellia has multiple rounds (see
   section Section 2.).  A hardware implementation (and some software
   implementations) can create a pipeline by unwinding the loop implied
   by this round structure.  For example, after a 16-octet block has
   been input, one round later another 16-octet block can be input, and
   so on.  In Camellia-CTR, these inputs are the sequential counter
   block values used to generate the key stream.

   Multiple independent Camellia encrypt implementations can also be
   used to improve performance.  For example, one could use two Camellia
   encrypt implementations in parallel, to process a sequence of counter
   block values, doubling the effective throughput.

   The sender can precompute the key stream.  Since the key stream does
   not depend on any data in the packet, the key stream can be

Internet-Draft  The Additional Modes of Camellia in IPsec     March 2007


   precomputed once the nonce and IV are assigned.  This precomputation
   can reduce packet latency.  The receiver cannot perform similar
   precomputation because the IV will not be known before the packet
   arrives.

   When used correctly, Camellia-CTR provides a high level of
   confidentiality.  Unfortunately, Camellia-CTR is easy to use
   incorrectly.  Being a stream cipher, any reuse of the per-packet
   value, called the IV, with the same nonce and key is catastrophic.
   An IV collision immediately leaks information about the plaintext in
   both packets.  For this reason, it is inappropriate to use this mode
   of operation with static keys.  Extraordinary measures would be
   needed to prevent reuse of an IV value with the static key across
   power cycles.  To be safe, implementations MUST use fresh keys with
   Camellia-CTR.  The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [8] protocol can be
   used to establish fresh keys.  IKE can also provide the nonce value.

   With Camellia-CTR, it is trivial to use a valid ciphertext to forge
   other (valid to the decryptor) ciphertexts.  Thus, it is equally
   catastrophic to use Camellia-CTR without a companion authentication
   function.  Implementations MUST use Camellia-CTR in conjunction with
   an authentication function, such as Camellia-CMAC-96 [22].

   To encrypt a payload with Camellia-CTR, the encryptor partitions the
   plaintext, PT, into 128-bit blocks.  The final block need not be 128
   bits; it can be less.

         PT = PT[1] PT[2] ... PT[n]

   Each PT block is XORed with a block of the key stream to generate the
   ciphertext, CT.  The Camellia encryption of each counter block
   results in 128 bits of key stream.  The most significant 96 bits of
   the counter block are set to the nonce value, which is 32 bits,
   followed by the per-packet IV value, which is 64 bits.  The least
   significant 32 bits of the counter block are initially set to one.
   This counter value is incremented by one to generate subsequent
   counter blocks, each resulting in another 128 bits of key stream.
   The encryption of n plaintext blocks can be summarized as:

         CTRBLK := NONCE || IV || ONE
         FOR i := 1 to n-1 DO
           CT[i] := PT[i] XOR Camellia(CTRBLK)
           CTRBLK := CTRBLK + 1
         END
         CT[n] := PT[n] XOR TRUNC(Camellia(CTRBLK))

   The Camellia() function performs Camellia encryption with the fresh
   key.

Internet-Draft  The Additional Modes of Camellia in IPsec     March 2007


   The TRUNC() function truncates the output of the Camellia encrypt
   operation to the same length as the final plaintext block, returning
   the most significant bits.

   Decryption is similar.  The decryption of n ciphertext blocks can be
   summarized as:


         CTRBLK := NONCE || IV || ONE
         FOR i := 1 to n-1 DO
           PT[i] := CT[i] XOR Camellia(CTRBLK)
           CTRBLK := CTRBLK + 1
         END
         PT[n] := CT[n] XOR TRUNC(Camellia(CTRBLK))

3.2.  Counter with CBC-MAC

   CCM is a generic authenticate-and-encrypt block cipher mode [4].  In
   this specification, CCM is used with the Camellia [5] block cipher.

   Camellia-CCM has two parameters:

   M  M indicates the size of the integrity check value (ICV).  CCM
      defines values of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 octets; However, to
      maintain alignment and provide adequate security, only the values
      that are a multiple of four and are at least eight are permitted.
      Implementations MUST support M values of 8 octets and 16 octets,
      and implementations MAY support an M value of 12 octets.

   L  L indicates the size of the length field in octets.  CCM defines
      values of L between 2 octets and 8 octets.  This specification
      only supports L = 4.  Implementations MUST support an L value of 4
      octets, which accommodates a full Jumbogram [11]; however, the
      length includes all of the encrypted data, which also includes the
      ESP Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header fields.

   There are four inputs to CCM originator processing:

   key
      A single key is used to calculate the ICV using CBC-MAC and to
      perform payload encryption using counter mode.  Camellia supports
      key sizes of 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.  The default key
      size is 128 bits, and implementations MUST support this key size.
      Implementations MAY also support key sizes of 192 bits and 256
      bits.

Internet-Draft  The Additional Modes of Camellia in IPsec     March 2007


   nonce
      The size of the nonce depends on the value selected for the
      parameter L. It is 15-L octets.  Implementations MUST support a
      nonce of 11 octets.  The construction of the nonce is described in
      Section 4.2.4.

   payload
      The payload of the ESP packet.  The payload MUST NOT be longer
      than 4,294,967,295 octets, which is the maximum size of a
      Jumbogram [11]; however, the ESP Padding, Pad Length, and Next
      Header fields are also part of the payload.

   AAD
      CCM provides data integrity and data origin authentication for
      some data outside the payload.  CCM does not allow additional
      authenticated data (AAD) to be longer than
      18,446,744,073,709,551,615 octets.  The ICV is computed from the
      ESP header, Payload, and ESP trailer fields, which is
      significantly smaller than the CCM-imposed limit.  The
      construction of the AAD described in Section 4.2.5.

   Camellia-CCM requires the encryptor to generate a unique per-packet
   value and to communicate this value to the decryptor.  This per-
   packet value is one of the component parts of the nonce, and it is
   referred to as the initialization vector (IV).  The same IV and key
   combination MUST NOT be used more than once.  The encryptor can
   generate the IV in any manner that ensures uniqueness.  Common
   approaches to IV generation include incrementing a counter for each
   packet and linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs).

   Camellia-CCM employs counter mode for encryption.  As with any stream
   cipher, reuse of the same IV value with the same key is catastrophic.
   An IV collision immediately leaks information about the plaintext in
   both packets.  For this reason, it is inappropriate to use this CCM
   with statically configured keys.  Extraordinary measures would be
   needed to prevent reuse of an IV value with the static key across
   power cycles.  To be safe, implementations MUST use fresh keys with
   Camellia-CCM.  The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [2] protocol or IKEv2
   [8] can be used to establish fresh keys.

4.  ESP Payload

   The ESP payload is made up of the IV followed by raw cipher-text.
   Thus the payload field, as defined in [7], is broken down according
   to the following diagram:

             Figure 1: ESP Payload Encrypted with Camellia-CTR

   The components of the counter block are as follows:

   Initialization Vector
      The Camellia-CTR IV field MUST be eight octets.  The IV MUST be
      chosen by the encryptor in a manner that ensures that the same IV
      value is used only once for a given key.  The encryptor can
      generate the IV in any manner that ensures uniqueness.  Common
      approaches to IV generation include incrementing a counter for
      each packet and linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs).
      Including the IV in each packet ensures that the decryptor can
      generate the key stream needed for decryption, even when some
      packets are lost or reordered.

   Encrypted Payload
      The encrypted payload contains the ciphertext.  Camellia-CTR mode
      does not require plaintext padding.  However, ESP does require
      padding to 32-bit word-align the authentication data.  The
      padding, Pad Length, and the Next Header MUST be concatenated with
      the plaintext before performing encryption, as described in [7].

   Authentication Data
      Since it is trivial to construct a forgery Camellia-CTR ciphertext
      from a valid Camellia-CTR ciphertext, Camellia-CTR implementations
      MUST employ a non-NULL ESP authentication method.
      Camellia-CMAC-96 [22] is a likely choice.

4.1.1.  Counter Block Format

   The Camellia counter block cipher block is 128 bits.  Figure 2 shows
   the format of the counter block.

                      Figure 2: Counter Block Format

   The components of the counter block are as follows:

   Nonce
      The Nonce field is 32 bits.  As the name implies, the nonce is a
      single use value.  That is, a fresh nonce value MUST be assigned
      for each security association.  It MUST be assigned at the
      beginning of the security association.  The nonce value need not
      be secret, but it MUST be unpredictable prior to the beginning of
      the security association.

   Initializetion Vector
      The IV field is 64 bits.  As described in section 3.1, the IV MUST
      be chosen by the encryptor in a manner that ensures that the same
      IV value is used only once for a given key.

   Block Counter
      The block counter field is the least significant 32 bits of the
      counter block.  The block counter begins with the value of one,
      and it is incremented to generate subsequent portions of the key
      stream.  The block counter is a 32-bit big-endian integer value.

   Using the encryption process described in Section 3.1, this
   construction permits each packet to consist of up to:

         (2^32)-1 blocks  =  4,294,967,295 blocks
                          = 68,719,476,720 octets

   This construction can produce enough key stream for each packet
   sufficient to handle any IPv6 jumbogram [11].

4.1.2.  Keying Material

   The minimum number of bits sent from the key exchange protocol to the
   ESP algorithm must be greater than or equal to the key size.

   The cipher's encryption and decryption key is taken from the first
   128, 192, or 256 bits of the keying material.

4.2.  Counter with CBC-MAC

   The ESP payload is composed of the IV followed by the ciphertext.
   The payload field, as defined in [7], is structured as shown in
   Figure 3.

             Figure 3: ESP Payload Encrypted with Camellia-CCM

4.2.1.  Initialization Vector (IV)

   The Camellia-CCM IV field MUST be eight octets.  The IV MUST be
   chosen by the encryptor in a manner that ensures that the same IV
   value is used only once for a given key.  The encryptor can generate
   the IV in any manner that ensures uniqueness.  Common approaches to
   IV generation include incrementing a counter for each packet and
   linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs).

   Including the IV in each packet ensures that the decryptor can
   generate the key stream needed for decryption, even when some

   datagrams are lost or reordered.

4.2.2.  Encrypted Payload

   The encrypted payload contains the ciphertext.

   Camellia-CCM mode does not require plaintext padding.  However, ESP
   does require padding to 32-bit word-align the authentication data.
   The Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header fields MUST be concatenated
   with the plaintext before performing encryption, as described in [7].
   When padding is required, it MUST be generated and checked in
   accordance with the conventions specified in [7].

4.2.3.  Authentication Data

   Camellia-CCM provides an encrypted ICV.  The ICV provided by CCM is
   carried in the Authentication Data fields without further encryption.
   Implementations MUST support ICV sizes of 8 octets and 16 octets.
   Implementations MAY also support ICV 12 octets.

4.2.4.  Nonce Format

   Each packet conveys the IV that is necessary to construct the
   sequence of counter blocks used by counter mode to generate the key
   stream.  The Camellia counter block is 16 octets.  One octet is used
   for the CCM Flags, and 4 octets are used for the block counter, as
   specified by the CCM L parameter.  The remaining octets are the
   nonce.  These octets occupy the second through the twelfth octets in
   the counter block.  Figure 4 shows the format of the nonce.

   Salt
      The salt field is 24 bits.  As the name implies, it contains an
      unpredictable value.  It MUST be assigned at the beginning of the
      security association.  The salt value need not be secret, but it

      MUST NOT be predictable prior to the beginning of the security
      association.

   Initialization Vector
      The IV field is 64 bits.  As described in Section 3.1, the IV MUST
      be chosen by the encryptor in a manner that ensures that the same
      IV value is used only once for a given key.

   This construction permits each packet to consist of up to:

            2^32 blocks  =  4,294,967,296 blocks
                         = 68,719,476,736 octets

   This construction provides more key stream for each packet than is
   needed to handle any IPv6 Jumbogram [11].

4.2.5.  AAD Construction

   The data integrity and data origin authentication for the Security
   Parameters Index (SPI) and (Extended) Sequence Number fields is
   provided without encrypting them.  Two formats are defined: one for
   32-bit sequence numbers and one for 64-bit extended sequence numbers.
   The format with 32-bit sequence numbers is shown in Figure 5, and the
   format with 64-bit extended sequence numbers is shown in Figure 6.

   Sequence Numbers are conveyed canonical network byte order.  Extended
   Sequence Numbers are conveyed canonical network byte order, placing
   the high-order 32 bits first and the low-order 32 bits second.
   Canonical network byte order is fully described in RFC 791, Appendix
   B.

5.  IKE Conventions

   Camellia was designed to follow the same API as the AES cipher.
   Therefore, this section defines only Phase 1 Identifier and Phase 2
   Identifier.  Any other consideration related to interaction with IKE
   is the same as that of the AES cipher.  Details can be found in IKE
   Conventions section of [13] and [16].

5.1.  Phase 1 Identifier

   This document does not specify the conventions for using Camellia-CTR
   and Camellia-CCM for IKE Phase 1 negotiations.  For Camellia-CTR and
   Camellia-CCM to be used in this manner, a separate specification is
   needed, and an Encryption Algorithm Identifier needs to be assigned.

5.2.  Phase 2 Identifier

   For IKE Phase 2 negotiations, IANA has assigned three ESP Transform
   Identifiers for Camellia-CTR and Camellia-CCM.

         <TBD1> for Camellia-CTR with and explict IV;
         <TBD2> for Camellia-CCM with an 8-octet ICV;
         <TBD3> for Camellia-CCM with a 12-octet ICV; and
         <TBD4> for Camellia-CCM with a 16-octet ICV.

5.3.  Key Length Attribute

   Since the Camellia supports three key lengths, the Key Length
   attribute MUST be specified in the IKE Phase 2 exchange [10].  The
   Key Length attribute MUST have a value of 128, 192, or 256.

7.  Security Considerations

   Camellia-CTR and Camellia-CCM employs counter (CTR) mode for
   confidentiality.  If a counter value is ever used for more that one
   packet with the same key, then the same key stream will be used to
   encrypt both packets, and the confidentiality guarantees are voided.

   What happens if the encryptor XORs the same key stream with two
   different packet plaintexts?  Suppose two packets are defined by two
   plaintext byte sequences P1, P2, P3 and Q1, Q2, Q3, then both are
   encrypted with key stream K1, K2, K3.  The two corresponding
   ciphertexts are:

         (P1 XOR K1), (P2 XOR K2), (P3 XOR K3)

         (Q1 XOR K1), (Q2 XOR K2), (Q3 XOR K3)


   If both of these two ciphertext streams are exposed to an attacker,
   then a catastrophic failure of confidentiality results, because:

         (P1 XOR K1) XOR (Q1 XOR K1) = P1 XOR Q1
         (P2 XOR K2) XOR (Q2 XOR K2) = P2 XOR Q2
         (P3 XOR K3) XOR (Q3 XOR K3) = P3 XOR Q3

   Once the attacker obtains the two plaintexts XORed together, it is
   relatively straightforward to separate them.  Thus, using any stream
   cipher, including Camellia-CTR, to encrypt two plaintexts under the
   same key stream leaks the plaintext.

   Therefore, Camellia-CTR and Camellia-CCM should not be used with
   statically configured keys.  Extraordinary measures would be needed
   to prevent the reuse of a counter block value with the static key
   across power cycles.  To be safe, implementations MUST use fresh keys
   with Camellia-CTR and Camellia-CCM.  The IKE [2] and IKEv2 [8]
   protocol can be used to establish fresh keys.

   When IKE is used to establish fresh keys between two peer entities,
   separate keys are established for the two traffic flows.  If a
   different mechanism is used to establish fresh keys, one that
   establishes only a single key to encrypt packets, then there is a
   high probability that the peers will select the same IV values for
   some packets.  Thus, to avoid counter block collisions, ESP
   implementations that permit use of the same key for encrypting and
   decrypting packets with the same peer MUST ensure that the two peers
   assign different salt values to the security association (SA).

   Regardless of the mode used, Camellia with a 128-bit key is

   vulnerable to the birthday attack after 2^64 blocks are encrypted
   with a single key.  Since ESP with Extended Sequence Numbers allows
   for up to 2^64 packets in a single SA, there is real potential for
   more than 2^64 blocks to be encrypted with one key.  Implementations
   SHOULD generate a fresh key before 2^64 blocks are encrypted with the
   same key.  Note that ESP with 32-bit Sequence Numbers will not exceed
   2^64 blocks even if all of the packets are maximum-length Jumbograms.

   IANA has assigned three ESP transform numbers for use with Camellia-
   CTR and Camellia-CCM:

         <TBD2> for Camellia-CCM with an 8-octet ICV;
         <TBD3> for Camellia-CCM with a 12-octet ICV; and
         <TBD4> for Camellia-CCM with a 16-octet ICV.
