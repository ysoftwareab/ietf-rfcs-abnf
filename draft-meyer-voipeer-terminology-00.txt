Internet-Draft   Terminology for Describing VoIP Peering    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The term "VoIP Peering" has historically been used to describe a wide
   variety of different aspects pertaining to the interconnection of
   service provider networks, and to the delivery of SIP call
   termination over those interconnections.  Further, since VoIP peering
   focuses on how to identify and route calls at the application level
   ("Layer 5"), it does not (necessarily) involve the exchange of packet
   routing data or even media sessions.  In particular, "layer 5
   network" is used here to refer to the interconnection between SIP
   servers (as opposed to interconnection at the IP layer).  Finally,
   the terms "peering" and "interconnect" are used interchangeably
   throughout this document.

   This document introduces standard terminology for use in
   characterizing VoIP interconnection.  Note however, that while this
   document is primarily targeted at the VoIP interconnect case, the
   terminology described here is applicable to those cases in which
   service providers interconnect using SIP signaling for real-time or
   quasi-real-time communications.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2
   provides the general context for voipeer, and Section 3 provides the
   general definitions for real-time SIP based communication, with focus
   on the VoIP interconnect case.  Section 4 briefly touches on terms
   from ENUM.  Finally, Section 5 provides comments on usage.


2.  Context

   Figure 1 depicts the general VoIP interconnect context in which the
   caller uses an E.164 number [ITU.E164.1991] as the "name" of the
   called user.  Note that this E.164 number is not an address, since at
   this point we do not have information about where the named endpoint
   is located.  In the case shown here, an E.164 number is used as a key
   to retrieve a NAPTR [RFC3404] record from the DNS, which in turn
   results in a SIP URI.  Call routing is then based on this SIP URI.
   Note call routing does not depend on the presence of an E.164 number;
   the SIP URI can be advertised in various other ways, such as on a web
   page.  Finally, note that the subsequent lookup steps, namely, look
   up of SRV, A, and AAAA records (as well as any routing steps below
   that) are outside the scope of voipeer.

   Figure 1: VoIP Interconnect Context

   Note that voipeer is primarily concerned with the acquisition and use
   of the Call Routing Data (CRD) shown in in Figure 1.  Importantly,
   the CRD can be derived from an E.164 entry, as shown in Figure 1, or
   via any other mechanism available to the user.


3.  General Definitions

3.1.  Call Routing Data (CRD)

   Call Routing Data, or CRD, is a SIP URI used to route a (real-time,
   voice or other type) call to its termination point.

   [ed: do we need a definition of "termination point"?]

3.2.  Call Routing

   Call routing is the set of processes, rules, and CRD used to route a
   VoIP call to its proper (SIP) destination.  More generally, it is the
   set of processes, rules and CRD used to route a real-time session to
   its termination point.

3.3.  PSTN

   The term "PSTN" refers to the Public Switched Telephone Network.  In
   particular, the PSTN refers to the collection of interconnected
   circuit-switched voice-oriented public telephone networks, both
   commercial and government-owned.  In general, PSTN terminals are

   addressed using E.164 numbers, noting that various dial-plans (such
   as emergency services dial-plans) may not directly use E.164 numbers.

3.4.  Network

   For purposes of this document and the voipeer work, a network is
   defined to be the set of SIP servers and customers that are
   controlled by a single administration.

3.5.  VoIP Service Provider

   A VoIP service provider is an entity that provides transport of SIP
   signaling and possibly media streams for its customers.  Such a
   service provider may additionally be interconnected with other
   service providers (i.e., it may "peer" Section 3.7 with other service
   providers).  Note that a VoIP service provider may also interconnect
   with the PSTN.

3.6.  Carrier

   The term carrier is defined to be a service provider authorized to
   issue E.164 numbers [ITU.E164.1991] for the provisioning of PSTN
   service under the authority of a National Regulatory Authority (NRA).

   noting also that the term "carrier" has both business and regulator
   connontations...

3.7.  Peering

   While the precise definition of the term "peering" is the subject of
   some debate, peering in general refers to the negotiation of
   reciprocal interconnection arrangements, settlement-free or
   otherwise, between operationally independent service providers.

3.8.  Layer 3 Peering

   Layer 3 peering refers to interconnection of two service providers
   for the purposes of exchanging IP packets.  Layer 3 peering is
   frequently agnostic to the IP payload, and is frequently achieved
   using a routing protocol such as BGP [RFC1771] to exchange the
   required routing information.

3.9.  Layer 5 Peering

   Layer 5 peering refers to interconnection of two service providers
   for the purposes of SIP signaling.  Note that in the layer 5 peering
   case, there is no intervening network.  That is, for purposes of this
   discussion, there is no such thing as a "Layer 5 Transit Network".

3.10.  VoIP Peering

   VoIP peering is defined to be a layer 5 peering between two VoIP
   providers for purposes of routing real-time (or quasi-real time) call
   signaling between their respective customers.


4.  ENUM

   ENUM [RFC3761] defines how the Domain Name System (DNS) can be used
   for identifying available services connected to one E.164 number.

4.1.  User ENUM

4.2.  Carrier ENUM


5.  Conclusions


6.  Acknowledgments

   Many of the definitions were gleaned from detailed discussions on the
   voipeer, enum, and sipping mailing lists.  Richard Shocky and Jean-
   Francois Mule made valuable contributions to early revisions of this
   document.  Patrik Faltstrom contributed the basis of Figure 1.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document itself introduces no new security considerations.
   However, it is important to note that VoIP interconnect has a wide
   variety of security issues that should be considered in documents
   addressing both protocol and use case analyzes.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces
   [RFC2434].
