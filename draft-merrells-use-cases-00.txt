Internet-Draft    Digital Identity Exchange - Use Cases       March 2006


3.  Use Cases

   The use cases below describe various scenarios for the Digital
   Identity Exchnage (DIX) protocol [dmd0].  Some use cases are
   dependant upon others, so should be perused in order.  Beth is our
   protagonist throughout; a typical Internet user, but she's a bit of a
   geek.

3.1.  UC1

   Beth receives an email from a friend introducing her to a new
   website, geeknews.com, a site that publishes techie news articles.
   She browses the site and decides to read some articles.  She sees an
   IN button, which she clicks.  Her identity agent performs an
   authentication process to ensure that it is representing Beth, and
   not an imposter.  Her identity agent displays a screen informing her
   that geeknews.com is requesting some data, her first name.  She
   enters 'Beth' at the prompt, provides consent and the data is sent to
   the site.

3.2.  UC2

   Beth browses to geekdate.com, she clicks an IN button.  Her identity
   agent displays a screen informing her that geekdate.com is requesting
   some data, her first name.  Her agent already has this data.  She
   provides consent and the data is sent to the site.

3.3.  UC3

   Beth decides to create a profile at geekdate.com.  She sees an IN
   button, which she clicks.  Her identity agent displays a screen
   informing her that geekdate.com is requesting some data, an
   Identifier.  She instructs her identity agent to create an identifier
   specific to her relationship with geekdate.com.  She provides consent
   and the data is sent to the site.

3.4.  UC4

   Beth decides to flesh out her profile at geekdate.com.  Geekdate.com
   displays a registration form.  One field requests a URL of a photo of
   her.  Beside it is a SAVE button.  She enters the URL and clicks the
   button.  Her identity agent displays a screen informing her that this
   data item can be stored.  She provides consent and the data is stored
   by her agent.

3.5.  UC5

   Geeknews.com offers Beth the option to build up a readership

Internet-Draft    Digital Identity Exchange - Use Cases       March 2006


   preferences profile over time, the benefit being that the site will
   tailor its content to her interests.  She decides to take up the
   offer, she sees an IN button, which she clicks.  Her identity agent
   displays a screen informing her that geeknews.com is requesting some
   data, an Identifier.  She selects an existing identifier that
   represents a subset of her identity, which is used for a subset of
   the sites she has a relationship with.  She provides consent and the
   data is sent to the site.

3.6.  UC6

   [Assumptions: Beth has visited geeknews and geekdate before and has
   informed her identity agent that she consents to a relationship with
   them.]  Beth starts her day with a strong coffee and a perusal of
   geeknews.com.  She starts her computer and authenticates herself to
   the operating system.  By that authentication mechanism she has also
   authenticated herself to her identity agent, as her vendor of that
   system has hooked it into the operating system's authentication
   system.  She browses to geeknews.com and clicks the IN button and is
   directly shown the content, no further clicks.  She then browses to
   geekdate.com, she clicks the IN button and is directly presented with
   her profile no further clicks.

3.7.  UC7

   Beth's identity agent prompts her to provide a 'spoken name'.  Using
   the multimedia capabilities of her computer she records her spoken
   name; an mp3 of her saying 'Beth'.  She later browses to
   voicebox.com, which runs a voicemail service, she opts to create an
   account and the site requests some properties, amongst which is a
   request for her spoken name.  She provides consent and the data is
   sent to the site.

3.8.  UC8

   Beth purchases a book from an online store, as she's checking out the
   store makes her an offer: 10% off for completion of a demographic
   survey.  She's tempted, but how many data fields are there?  One
   hundred!  Too many to be worth the effort.  But it happens to be
   commonly requested data, which she has already entered during
   previous exchanges with other sites.  So, she completes the remaining
   fields, saving them to her identity agent for future reuse.  She
   provides consent and the data is sent to the site.

3.9.  UC9

   Beth has invested significant effort in building up a persona and
   reputation around a specific identifier, her 'home' identifier.  But,

Internet-Draft    Digital Identity Exchange - Use Cases       March 2006


   she has become dissatisfied with her identity agent and so decides to
   switch vendors.  She establishes the new agent and migrates her
   identity data from the old one to the new one.  She then administers
   her identifier so that her new identity agent is authoritative for
   authentication and provision of identity data.

3.10.  UC10

   Whilst in town Beth stops off at an Internet Cafe to check her email.
   She goes to her webmail account, which requires that she identity
   herself.  Her Identity Agent prompts her for consent and provides her
   identifier so that she can gain access to her email.

3.11.  UC11

   Beth visits a website that requests some identity information.  Her
   Identity Agent warns her that satisfying the request would contravene
   her established privacy policy.

3.12.  UC12

   Beth moves house, so she changes the home address information stored
   by her Identity Agent.  Her Identity Agent offers to notify all
   relying parties to whom she has previously provided her home address.

3.13.  UC13

   Beth is a frequent traveler on Galactic Air, whose site offers a
   claim of membership for use at affiliate sites.  She acquires a
   membership claim, which her Identity Agent stores for her.

3.14.  UC14

   Beth visits a Galactic Air affiliate site that provides discounted
   travel insurance for frequent travelers.  She presents her Galactic
   Air membership claim and receives a discount.

3.15.  UC15

   Beth leaves work and goes to the bus stop.  Whilst waiting for the
   next bus home she uses her smart phone to browse geeknews.com.  Her
   Identity Agent provides her with the same clickless browsing that she
   experiences on her work and home computers.

3.16.  UC16

   Beth is ending her day at work.  She leaves work and waits for the
   next bus home.  Her friend calls and invites her to the movies.  She

   uses her phone to browse to the movies.com to find out what's
   playing.  The site requests her current location, which she consents
   to release via her Identity Agent.

3.17.  UC17

   Beth signs up with a financial services site, BigPicture.com, which
   provides an aggregate view of her finances.  She provides the site
   with agency rights over each of her existing bank accounts.

3.18.  UC18

   Beth goes to an auction side, ibay.com.  Her Identity Agent shows a
   signed graphic of ibay.com for releasing data.  Beth knows that she's
   dealing with ibay.com, and not an imposter.

3.19.  UC19

   Beth visits her online bank, which requires the use of a strong
   authentication mechanism.  She authenticates to her Identity Agent
   using a two-factor device indicated by the bank to be an acceptable
   mechanism.

3.20.  UC20

   Adam uses a service to acquire a verified email claim.  With it he
   can prove that he owns his email address, Adam@example.com, without
   having to go through a verification process.

3.21.  UC21

   Beth gives her friend, Adam@example.com, access to her photos.  Adam
   receives an email from Beth inviting him to view her photos.  He goes
   to the site, which requests a verified email claim.  He presents his
   claim and gains access to the photos Beth has published for him.

3.22.  UC22

   Adam visits a site that requires that he prove he is over 21.  He
   provides the site with a claim that he is over 21 from the government
   of his country of residence, gov.ca.  The site is unable to find out
   who Adam is from gov.ca.

3.23.  UC23

   Adam returns to the same site.  He must again prove that he is over
   21.  He provides a claim, but the site cannot tell that it is Adam
   that has returned again to the site.

3.24.  UC24

   Adam heavily frequents two gambling sites, goldenslots.com and
   luckydice.com.  He uses the same identifier accross both sites, so
   that they know he is the same person.

3.25.  UC25

   Beth's employer has partnered with a local university to provide it's
   staff with access to online courses.  She signs up for some modules
   at the university admissions website acquiring an enrollment claim.
   She then browses to the computer science school website to sign up
   for an advanced programming course.  The site requests claims that
   she is an employee, that she has previously completed some basic
   introductory modules, and that she has been enrolled.

3.26.  UC26

   Beth is shopping online for a new laptop computer.  She visits an
   online site that caters to recently graduated professionals.  She
   selects a machine and investigates the lease options available.  To
   work out the monthly payment the site requests some claims: A claim
   that she's an alumni of a university, so that the site can include an
   appropriately branded tote bag.  A claim that she's a member of
   Galactic Air, so that she can be credited with airmiles for her
   purchase.  And, a claim from a credit scoring agency that she has a
   'good' credit rating.

3.27.  UC27

   Beth is at home checking her work email, she has an email from a
   colleague assigning a customer support issue to her.  The company
   help desk system is provided by helpdesk.com, an on-demand
   application provider.  She clicks through a link in the email to the
   page that describes the issue.  Helpdesk.com requests a claim that
   Beth is an employee of 'Nano Software Inc', which she provides from
   her Identity Agent, and she gains access to the page.
