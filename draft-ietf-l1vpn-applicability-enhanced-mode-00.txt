Abstract 
    
   This document provides an applicability analysis on the use of 
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and 
   mechanisms to satisfy the requirements of the Layer 1 Virtual Private 
   Network (L1VPN) Enhanced Mode. 
    
   L1VPNs provide customer services and connectivity at layer 1 over 
   layer 1 networks. The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic 
   Mode and the Enhanced Mode, where the Enhanced Mode of operation 
   features exchange of routing information between the layer 1 network 
   and the customer domain.

   In addition, this document identifies areas where additional protocol 
   extensions or procedures are needed to satisfy the requirements of 
   the L1VPN Enhanced Mode, and provides guidelines for potential 
   extensions.

2. Terminology 
    
   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology in 
   [RFC3031], [RFC3209], [RFC3471], [RFC3473], [RFC4202], [RFC4026] and 
   [L1VPN-FW]. 
    
3. Introduction 
    
   This document shows the applicability of existing Generalized 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and mechanisms to the 
   Layer 1 Virtual Private Network (L1VPN) Enhanced Mode. In addition, 
   this document identifies several areas where additional protocol 
   extensions or modifications are needed to meet the L1VPN Enhanced 
   Mode service requirements set out in [L1VPN-FW]. 
    
   In particular, this document shows section by section (from Section 5 
   to 8) the applicability of GMPLS protocols and mechanisms to each 
   sub-model of the Enhanced Mode mentioned in [L1VPN-FW], along with 
   additional work areas needed to fully support the requirements for 
   each sub-model. 
    
   Note that discussion in this document is limited to areas where GMPLS 
   protocols and mechanisms are relevant. 
    
   As will be described in this document, support of the Overlay 
   Extension service model and the Virtual Node service model are well 
   covered by existing protocol mechanisms already described in other 
   documents, with only minor protocol extensions required. The Virtual 
   Link service model and the Per-VPN Peer service model are not 
   explicitly covered by existing documents, but can be realized by 
   extending current GMPLS protocols and mechanisms as described in this 
   document. 
    
   The following section lists areas where additional work may be 
   required to fully support the requirements for each sub-model. Some 
   of the requirements are optional, therefore the additional work is 
   also optional. 
    
   Commonalities of mechanisms over various sub-models, as well as over 
   the L1VPN Basic Mode need to be considered. Also, various mechanisms 
   should be coordinated in such a way that services are provided in a 
   fully functional manner. 
    
3.1 Work Items 
    
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.           Expires May 2007                   [Page 3]

   This list of additional work areas is a summary derived from the main 
   body of this document. The list will be updated in later versions of 
   this document along with the development of the additional or 
   enhanced requirements and increased understanding of the issues. As 
   work progresses on protocol extensions, this list will be updated to 
   remove completed items, and the body of this document will be updated 
   to describe the analysis of protocol extensions. The intention is 
   that this whole section is removed when the work has been completed 
   and this document progresses to become an RFC. 
    
   o Routing representation (how a VPN should be represented in routing, 
     e.g., single area, multi-area, multi-AS). See Sections 6.3 and 7.3. 
   o Signaling and routing for support of the Per-VPN Peer service  
     model. See Section 8.3. 
    
3.2 Existing Solutions Drafts 
    
   This section lists existing solution documents that describe how the 
   L1VPN Enhanced Mode may be constructed using the mechanisms of GMPLS. 
   This document draws on those solutions and explains their 
   applicability and suggests further extensions to make the solutions 
   more closely match the framework described in [L1VPN-FW]. Further 
   solution documents may be listed in a future version of this  
   document. 
    
   o [GVPN] describes a suite of port-based Provider-provisioned VPN 
     services called Generalized VPNs (GVPNs) that use BGP for VPN 
     auto-discovery and GMPLS as a signaling mechanism. 
    
   o [L1VPN-BM] addresses the L1VPN Basic Mode signaling. 
    
   Note that although [L1VPN-BM] specifies signaling mechanisms for 
   L1VPN Basic Mode, it is applicable to the L1VPN Enhanced Mode, unless 
   otherwise specified. Therefore, main focus of this document is how to 
   realize routing related information exchange between a CE and a PE. 
    
4. General Guidelines 
    
   This section provides general guidelines for L1VPN solutions. Note 
   that applicability to specific sub-models will be separately 
   described in following sections. 
    
   One important general guideline is that protocol mechanisms should be 
   re-used where possible. This means that solutions should be 
   incremental, building on existing protocol mechanisms rather than 
   developing wholly new protocols. Further, as service models are 
   extended or developed resulting in the requirement for additional 
   functionalities, deltas should be added to the protocol mechanisms 
   rather than developing new techniques. [L1VPN-FW] describes how the 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.           Expires May 2007                   [Page 4] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-enhanced-mode-00.txt      November 2006 
 
 
   service models can be seen to provide "cascaded" functionality, and 
   this should be leveraged to achieve re-use of protocol extensions so 
   that, for example, it is highly desirable that the same signaling 
   protocols and extensions are used in both the Basic Mode and the 
   Enhanced Mode. 
    
   In addition, the following are general guidelines. 
    
   - The support of L1VPNs should not necessitate any change to core (P) 
     devices. Therefore, any protocol extensions made to facilitate 
     L1VPNs need to be made in a backward compatible way allowing GMPLS 
     aware P devices to continue to function. 
   - Customer (C) devices not directly involved in providing L1VPN 
     services should also be protected from protocol extensions made to 
     support L1VPNs. Again, such protocol extensions need to be backward 
     compatible. Note however, that some L1VPN service models allow for 
     VPN connectivity between C devices rather than between CE devices: 
     in this case, the C devices may need to be aware of protocol 
     extensions. 
   - Solutions should aim to minimize the protocol extensions on CE 
     devices. 
   - Solutions should be scalable and manageable. Solutions should not 
     require L1VPN state to be maintained on the P devices as much as 
     possible. 
   - Solutions should be secure. Providers should be able to screen and 
     protect information based on their operational policies. 
   - Solutions should provide an operational view of the L1VPN for the 
     customer and provider. There should be a common operational and 
     management perspective in regard to other (L2 and L3) VPN services. 
    
5. Overlay Extension Service Model 
    
5.1 Overview of the Service Model 
    
   This service model complements the Basic Mode and may assume all of 
   the requirements, solutions and work items for that model. 
    
   In this service model, a CE receives from its attached PEs a list of 
   TE link addresses to which it can request a VPN connection (i.e., 
   membership information). 
    
   The CE may also receive some TE information concerning these CE-PE 
   links within the VPN (e.g., switching type). 
    
   The CE does not receive any of the following from the PE. 
    
   - Routing information about the core provider network. 
   - Information about P device addresses. 
   - Information about P-P, PE-P or PE-PE TE links. 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.           Expires May 2007                   [Page 5] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-enhanced-mode-00.txt      November 2006 
 
 
   - Routing information about other customer sites. The CE may have 
     access to routing information about the remainder of the VPN (C-C 
     and CE-C links), but this is exchanged by control plane tunneling 
     on the CE-CE connections and is not passed to the CE in the control 
     plane exchange between PE and CE. 
    
5.2 Applicability of Existing Solutions 
    
   The following are required in this service model (in addition to 
   requirements in the L1VPN Basic Mode). 
    
   - VPN membership information exchange between a CE and PE. 
   - CE-PE TE link information exchange between a CE and a PE. 
    
   [GVPN] covers the requirement to exchange membership information 
   between the CE and the PE based on BGP. Furthermore, [BGP-TE] allows 
   the exchange of CE-PE TE link information between a CE and a PE. 
    
5.3 Additional Work Area(s) 
    
   None. 
    
6. Virtual Node Service Model 
    
6.1 Overview of the Service Model 
    
   In this service model, there is a private routing exchange between 
   the CE and the PE, or to be more precise between the CE routing 
   protocol instance and the VPN routing protocol instance running on 
   the PE. The provider network is considered as one private node from 
   the customer's perspective. The routing information exchanged between 
   the CE and the PE includes CE-PE TE link information, customer 
   network (i.e., remote CE sites), and may include TE links (Forwarding 
   Adjacencies) connecting CEs (or Cs) across the provider network as 
   well as control plane topology information from the customer network 
   (i.e., CE sites). 
    
6.2 Applicability of Existing Solutions 
    
   The following are required in this service model. 
    
   - VPN routing 
   - Signaling: CE-CE Label Switching Path (LSP) setup, deletion, and 
     modification 
    
   [GVPN] covers most of the requirements. 
    
   Specifically, [GVPN] handles VPN routing by a per VPN database called 
   the GVSI (Generalized Virtual Switching Instance) held in each PE. 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.           Expires May 2007                   [Page 6] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-enhanced-mode-00.txt      November 2006 
 
 
   GVSIs are inter-connected by tunnel-based control channels, and 
   routing adjacencies are established between them. BGP is used for 
   auto-discovery of remote GVSIs (VPN auto-discovery) in the same VPN. 
   GVSIs advertise VPN routing information by using a single ROUTER_ID 
   to represent the provider network as one node. 
    
   It is also possible to use IGP-based auto-discovery (based on [L1VPN-
   OSPF-DISC]), instead of BGP-based auto-discovery. 
    
   Signaling mechanisms are covered by [L1VPN-BM]. 
    
6.3 Additional Work Area(s) 
    
   o Routing Representation 
    
     [GVPN] allows flexible routing configuration for each VPN (e.g., 
     single IGP area, multiple IGP areas, or multiple ASes). 
    
     However, it may be valuable to consider how to represent a VPN in 
     routing. This may simplify the solution (e.g., in terms of 
     scalability). This requires further discussion. 
    
7. Virtual Link Service Model 
    
7.1 Overview of the Service Model 
    
   In this service model, virtual links are established between PEs. A 
   virtual link is assigned to each VPN and disclosed to the 
   corresponding CEs. The routing information exchanged between the CE 
   and the PE includes CE-PE TE links, customer network (i.e., remote CE 
   sites), virtual links (i.e., PE-PE links) assigned to each VPN, and 
   may include CE-CE (or C-C) Forwarding Adjacencies as well as control 
   plane topology from the customer network (i.e., CE sites). 
    
7.2 Applicability of Existing Solutions 
    
   Currently, there is no solution document for this type of service 
   model. 
    
7.3 Additional Work Area(s) 
    
   Simple modifications of [GVPN], in addition to enhancements mentioned 
   in Section 6.3, may realize this type of service model. Modifications 
   could be: 
    
   - Do NOT modify the ROUTER_ID of the TE link information when 
     advertising a CE-PE TE link to the CE (in the OSPF packet header as 
     well as in the LSA header). 
    
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.           Expires May 2007                   [Page 7] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-enhanced-mode-00.txt      November 2006 
 
 
   - Set up Forwarding Adjacency LSPs (FA-LSPs, GVSI-LSPs in [GVPN] 
     terms) between PEs to construct virtual links, and advertise these 
     FAs in VPN routing. Note these FAs (virtual links) may be assigned 
     private addresses, which means customer assigned addresses (or that 
     customers are allowed to configure addresses). This may require 
    extensions to current IGP behavior. 
    
   There could be other ways to construct virtual links (e.g., virtual 
   links without actually setting up an FA-LSP [MRN-REQ]). 
    
   Resource management for a dedicated data plane is a mandatory 
   requirement for the Virtual Link service model. This could be 
   realized by assigning pre-configured FA-LSPs to each VPN routing 
   protocol instance (no protocol extensions needed) in order to 
   instantiate the necessary FAs. 
    
   Note that as in the case of the Virtual Node service model, solution 
   details may differ depending on the routing representation. This 
   requires further discussion. 
    
8. Per-VPN Peer Service Model 
    
8.1 Overview of the Service Model 
    
   In this service model, the provider partitions TE links within the 
   provider network per VPN. The routing information exchanged between 
   the CE and the PE includes CE-PE TE links, customer network (i.e., 
   remote CE sites), as well as partitioned portions of the provider 
   network, and may include CE-CE (or C-C) Forwarding Adjacencies and 
   control plane topology from customer network (i.e., CE sites). Note 
   that PEs may abstract routing information about the provider network 
   and advertise it to CEs. 
    
   Note scalability must be carefully considered for advertising 
   provider network routing information to the CE [INTER-DOMAIN-FW]. 
    
8.2 Applicability of Existing Solutions 
    
   Currently, there is no solution document for this type of service 
   model. 
    
8.3 Additional Work Area(s) 
    
   There are two approaches for this service model. 
    
   o Signaling and routing for support of the per-VPN Peer service 
     model 
    
     Option1: Virtual Link based approach 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.           Expires May 2007                   [Page 8] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-enhanced-mode-00.txt      November 2006 
 
 
    
       The Per-VPN Peer service model may be realized by extending the 
       virtual link technique so that not only PEs but also Ps that 
       contain end points of virtual links in the abstracted topology 
       contain VPN routing instances. There may be no additional 
       protocol extensions needed from the Virtual Link service model. 
    
     Option2: Virtual Node based approach 
    
       The Per-VPN Peer service model may be realized by extending the 
       virtual node technique so that PEs selectively advertise 
       provider internal TE links to CEs. There are several extensions 
       needed for this. 
    
   Details are for further study. 
    
9. Discussion 
    
   This section summarizes items for which existing solutions may need 
   to be extended in order to fulfill the full set of L1VPN Enhanced 
   Mode functionalities. 
    
   For the Overlay Extension service model and the Virtual Node service 
   model, the existing solutions can be applied with few extensions. 
    
   As described in Sections 7.2 and 8.2, there are no existing solutions 
   to support the Virtual Link service model and the Per-VP Peer service 
   model. For the Virtual Link service model, however, minor extensions 
   from existing solutions are expected to meet the requirements. 
    
   Note that the list of additional work areas will be updated in later 
   versions of this document with the development of additional or 
   enhanced requirements and further understanding of the issues. 
    
   o Routing representation 
     - One building block for the Enhanced Mode 
     - Further discussion required (single area, multi areas, multi  
       ASes, etc.) 
     - Impact: Details to be studied (routing etc.) 
    
   o Signaling and routing for support of the Per-VPN Peer service model 
     - Details for further study 
    
10. Manageability Considerations 
    
   Section 11 of [L1VPN-FW] describes manageability considerations for 
   L1VPNs. 
    

 
 
T.Takeda, et al.           Expires May 2007                   [Page 9] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-enhanced-mode-00.txt      November 2006 
 
 
   This document defines a following new manageability requirement 
   specific for the L1VPN Enhanced Mode. 
    
   MIB modules MUST be available for any protocol extensions for the 
   L1VPN Enhanced Mode. 
    
   A future revision of this document may cover more aspects. 
    
11. Security Considerations 
    
   Section 12 of [L1VPN-FW] describes security considerations for  
   L1VPNs. This document defines a following new security requirements 
   specific for the L1VPN Enhanced Mode. 
    
   In the L1VPN Enhanced Mode, since there is a routing adjacency 
   between a CE and a PE, care must be taken whether the provider 
   network's control plane topology information is leaked to the CE. Due 
   to security concerns, this is not recommended in general, and there 
   must be a mechanism to prevent such operation. 
    
   A future revision of this document may cover more aspects.
