1 INTRODUCTION


    This document intends to inform how to transport telephony
    signalling protocols, used in classic telephony systems, over IP
    networks. The whole architecture is called SIGTRAN (Signalling

    Transport) as described in RFC2719 and is composed of a transport
    protocol(SCTP) and several User Adaptation (UAL) layers. The
    transport protocol SCTP has been been developed to fulfill the
    stringent requirements that telephony signalling networks have. The
    set of User Adaptation layers have also been introduced to make it
    possible that different signalling protocols can use the SCTP layer.



1.1 Scope 


    The scope of this document is to explain the way that user
    adaptation layers and SCTP protocols have to be used to transport
    Telephony signalling information over IP.



1.2 Terminology


    The following terms are commonly identified in related work:


    Association: SCTP connection between two endpoints.

    Stream: A uni-directional logical channel established within an
    association, within which all user messages are delivered in
    sequence except for those submitted to the unordered delivery
    service.

    SPU: Signalling protocol user, the application on top of the User
    adaptation layer.
    
    CTSP: Classical Telephony Signalling protocol(examples: MTP level2,
    MTP level 3, SCCP....).

    UAL: User adaptation layer: the protocol that encapsulate the upper
    layer telephony signalling protocols that are to be transported over
    SCTP/IP.

    ISEP: IP signalling endpoint: a IP node that implements SCTP and a
    User adapatation layer.

    SP: signalling point

2 SIGTRAN architecture


    The SIGTRAN architecture describes the transport of signalling
    information over IP infrastructure.

    Telephony Signalling transport over IP normally uses the following
    architecture:

                              |
               Internet Protocol (IPv4/IPv6)

    Figure 1.1: Telephony signalling transport protocol stack


    The components of the protocol stack are :

    (1) Adaptation modules are used when the telephony application needs
    to preserve an existing primitive interface. (e.g. management
    indications, data operation primitives, ... for a particular
    user/application protocol).

    (2) SCTP, specially configured to meet the telephony application
    performance requirements.

    (3) The standard Internet Protocol.

    The telephony signalling protocols to be transported can be:

    - SS7 MTP3 users: SCCP, ISUP, TUP...  

    - SS7 MTP2 users: MTP3 

    - SS7 SCCP users: RANAP, MAP(+TCAP), INAP(+TCAP)...

    - ISDN Q.921 users: Q.931

    - V5.2/DSS1 

    - ....

Coene et al                                                     [Page 4]

Draft                 Telephony Signalling AS                 April 2002


    Every classic telephony protocol can have a corresponding UAL
    developed.

    The user adaptation layers(UALs) are a set of protocols that
    encapsulate a specific signalling protocol to be transported over
    SCTP. The adapation is done in a way that the upper signalling
    protocols that are relayed remain unaware that the lower layers are
    different to the originail lower telephony signalling layers. In
    that sense, the upper interface of the user adapatation layers need
    to be the same as the upper layer interface to its original lower
    layer. If a MTP user is being relayed over the IP network, the
    related UAL used to transport the MTP user will have the same upper
    interface as MTP has.

    The Stream Control Transmission protocol was designed to fulfill the
    stringent transport requirements that classical signalling protocols
    have and is therefore the recommended transport protocol to use for
    this purpose.

    The following functions are provided by SCTP:

    - Reliable Data Transfer

    - Multiple streams to help avoid head-of-line blocking

    - Ordered and unordered data delivery on a per-stream basis

    - Bundling and fragmentation of user data

    - Congestion and flow control

    - Support continuous monitoring of reachability

    - Graceful termination of association

    - Support of multi-homing for added reliability

    - Protection against blind denial-of-service attacks

    - Protection against blind masquerade attacks


    SCTP is used as the transport protocol for telephony signalling
    applications.  Message boundaries are preserved during data
    transport by SCTP and so each UA can specify its own message
    structure withing the SCTP user data. The SCTP user data can be
    delivered by the order of transmission within a stream(in sequence
    delivery) or unordered.

    SCTP can be used to provide redundancy at the
    transport layer and below. Telephony applications needing this level
    of redundancy can make use of SCTP's multi-homing support.


Coene et al                                                     [Page 5]

Draft                 Telephony Signalling AS                 April 2002

    SCTP can be used for telephony applications where head-of-line
    blocking is a concern. Such an application should use multiple
    streams to provide independent ordering of telephony signalling
    messages.



3 Issues for transporting telephony signalling over SCTP


    Transport of telephony signalling requires special
    considerations. In order to use SCTP, special care must be taken to
    meet the performance, timing and failure management requirements.



3.1 Congestion Control


    The basic mechanism of congestion control in SCTP have been
    described in [RFC2960]. SCTP congestion control sometimes conflicts
    with the timing requirements of telephony signalling application
    messages which are transported by SCTP. During congestion, messages
    may be delayed by SCTP, thus sometimes violating the timing
    requirements of those telephony applications.

    In an engineered network (e.g. a private intranet), in which network
    capacity and maximum traffic are very well understood, some
    telephony signalling applications may choose to relax the congestion
    control rules of SCTP in order to satisfy the timing
    requirements. In order to do this, they should employ their own
    congestion control mechanisms. But this should be done without
    destabilising the network, otherwise this would lead to potential
    congestion collapse of the network.

    Some telephony signalling applications may have their own congestion
    control and flow control techniques. These techniques may interact
    with the congestion control procedures in SCTP.



3.2 Detection of failures


    Telephony systems often must have no single point of failure in
    operation.
    
    The UA must meet certain service availability and performance
    requirements according to the classical signalling layers they are
    replacing. Those requirements may be specific for each UA.

    For example, telephony systems are often required to be able to
    preserve stable calls during a component failure. Therefore error
    situations at the transport layer and below must be detected quickly

Coene et al                                                     [Page 6]

Draft                 Telephony Signalling AS                 April 2002

    so that the UA can take approriate steps to recover and preserve the
    calls. This poses special requirements on SCTP to discover
    unreachablility of a destination address or a peer.



3.2.1 Retransmission TimeOut (RTO) calculation


    The SCTP protocol parameter RTO.Min value has a direct impact on the
    calculation of the RTO itself. Some telephony applications want to
    lower the value of the RTO.Min to less than 1 second. This would
    allow the message sender to reach the maximum
    number-of-retransmission threshold faster in the case of network
    failures. However, lowering RTO.Min may have a negative impact on
    network behaviour [ALLMAN99].

    In some rare cases, telephony applications might not want to use the
    exponential timer back-off concept in RTO calculation in order to
    speed up failure detection. The danger of doing this is that, when
    network congestion occurs, not backing off the timer may worsen the
    congestion situation. Therefore, this strategy should never be used
    in public Internet.

    It should be noted that not using delayed SACK will also help faster
    failure detection.



3.2.2 Heartbeat


    For faster detection of (un)availability of idle paths, the
    telephony application may consider lowering the SCTP parameter
    HB.interval. It should be noted this might result in a higher traffic
    load.



3.2.3 Maximum number of retransmissions


    Setting Path.Max.Retrans and Association.Max.Retrans SCTP parameters
    to lower values will speed up both destination address and peer
    failure detection. However, if these values are set too low, the
    probability of false fault detections might increase.



3.3 Shorten end-to-end message delay


    Telephony applications often require short end-to-end message
    delays.  The method described in section 3.2.1 on lowering RTO may

Coene et al                                                     [Page 7]

Draft                 Telephony Signalling AS                 April 2002

    be considered. The different paths within a single association will
    have a different RTO, so using the path with the lowest RTO will
    lead to a shorter end-to-end message delay for the application
    running on top of the UA's.



3.4 Bundling considerations


    Bundling small telephony signalling messages at transmission helps
    improve the bandwidth usage efficiency of the network. On the
    downside, bundling may introduce additional delay to some of the
    messages. This should be taken into consideration when end-to-end
    delay is a concern.



3.5 Stream Usage


    Telephony signalling traffic is often composed of multiple,
    independent message sequences. It is highly desirable to transfer
    those independent message sequences in separate SCTP streams. This
    reduces the probability of head-of-line blocking in which the
    retransmission of a lost message affects the delivery of other
    messages not belonging to the same message sequence.



4 User Adaptation Layers


    Users Adaptation Layers have been defined to encapsulate different
    signalling protocols in order to transport them over SCTP/IP.

    There are UALs for both access signalling (DSS1) and trunk signalling
    (SS7). A brief description of the standardized UALs follows in the
    next sub-sections.

    The delivery mechanism in the several UALs

       - Supports seamless operation of UALs user peers over an IP network
         connection.

       - Supports the interface boundary that the UAL user had with the
         traditional lower layer.

       - Supports management of SCTP transport associations and traffic
         between SGs and ISEPs or two ISEPs

       - Supports asynchronous reporting of status changes to management.

    Two main scenarios have been developed for Signalling Transport:

    - Intercommunication of traditional Signalling transport nodes and IP
    based nodes.

    This is also referred to as IPSP communication. IPSP is the name
    given to the role that a UAL plays on an IP-based node. It stands
    for IP Signalling Point.



4.1  IUA (ISDN Q.921 User Adaptation)


    This protocol supports both ISDN Primary Rate Access (PRA) as well
    as Basic Rate Access (BRA) including the support for both
    point-to-point and point-to-multipoint modes of communication.  This
    support includes Facility Associated Signalling (FAS), Non-Facility
    Associated Signalling (NFAS) and NFAS with backup D channel.

    It implements the client/server architecture. The default
    orientation is for the SG to take on the role of server while the
    ISEP is the client. The SCTP (and UDP/TCP) Registered User Port
    Number Assignment for IUA is 9900.

    Examples of the upper layers to be transported are Q.931 and QSIG.

    The main scenario supported by this UAL is the SG to ISEP
    communication where the ISEP role is typically played by a node
    called an MGC, as defined in [RFC2719].

    It is an extension from the IUA layer with the modifications needed
    to support the differences between Q.921 / Q.931, and V5.2 layer 2 /
    layer 3. It supports analog telephone access, ISDN basic rate access
    and ISDN primary rate access over a V5.2 interface. It is typically
    implemented in an interworking scenario with SG.

4.4  M2UA (SS7 MTP2 User Adaptation) Layer


    This protocol is typically used between a Signalling Gateway (SG) and
    Media Gateway Controler (MGC). The SG will terminate up to MTP Level
    2 and the MGC will terminate MTP Level 3 and above.  In other words,
    the SG will transport MTP Level 3 messages over an IP network to a
    MGC.

    MTP3 and MTP3b are the only MTP2 Users that are transported by this
    UAL.

    The SG provides a interworking of transport functions with the IP
    transport, to transfer the MTP2-User signalling messages with MTP2-
    User at an application server(e.g. MGC).

4.5  M2PA (SS7 MTP2-User Peer-to-Peer Adaptation) Layer


    This protocol is used between SS7 Signalling Points using the MTP
    Level 3 protocol. The SS7 Signalling Points may also employ standard
    SS7 links using the SS7 MTP Level 2 to provide transport of MTP
    Level 3 signalling messages.

    Both configurations: interworking of SS7 and IP with SG and
    communication between ISEPs are possible.

Draft                 Telephony Signalling AS                 April 2002


       a. M2PA: IPSP processes MTP3/MTP2 primitives.
          M2UA: MGC transports MTP3/MTP2 primitives between the SG's MTP2
                and the MGC's MTP3 (via the NIF) for processing.

       b. M2PA: SG-IPSP connection is an SS7 link.
          M2UA: SG-MGC connection is not an SS7 link. It is an
                extension of MTP to a remote entity.

       c. M2PA: SG is an SS7 node with a point code.
          M2UA: SG is not necessarily an SS7 node and may not have a point code.

       d. M2PA: SG can have upper SS7 layers, e.g., SCCP.
          M2UA: SG does not have upper SS7 layers since it has no MTP3.

       e. M2PA: relies on MTP3 for management procedures.
          M2UA: uses M2UA management procedures.




4.6  M3UA (SS7 MTP3 User Adaptation) Layer


    This adaptation layer supports the transport of any SS7 MTP3-User
    signalling such as TUP, ISUP and SCCP over IP using the services of
    SCTP.

    This protocol allows both: 

       - Interworking of SS7 and IP nodes 
       - Communication between two IP nodes

    It works using the client-server architecture. It is recommended
    that the ISEP act as the client and initiate SCTP associations with
    the SG.  The port reserved by IANA is port number 2905. this is the
    port upon which the SG should listen for client connections.

    The assigned payload protocol identifier for the SCTP DATA chunks is
    "3".




4.7  SUA (SS7 SCCP User Adaptation) Layer


    This adaptation layer supports the transport of any SS7 SCCP-User
    signalling such as MAP, INAP, SMS, BSSAP, RANAP over IP using the
    services of SCTP.

    For message relaying, SUA should have the same timing constraints as
    SCCP .  For the end-to-end approach, SUA applications may have
    broader timing requirements (from 100 of milliseconds to hours)
    which allows the applications to guard themselves.


    Possible configurations showed in the pictures below:

       - Interworking of SS7 and IP
       - IP Node to IP Node communication

5 Security considerations


    UALs are designated to carry signalling messages for telephony
    services. As such, UALs must involve the security needs of several
    parties: the end users of the services; the network providers and
    the applications involved.  Additional requirements may come from
    local regulation.  While having some overlapping security needs, any
    security solution should fulfill all of the different parties'
    needs.  See specific Security considerations in each UAL technical
    specification.

    SCTP only tries to increase the availability of a network. SCTP does
    not contain any protocol mechanisms which are directly related to
    user message authentication, integrity and confidentiality
    functions. For such features, it depends on the IPSEC protocols and
    architecture and/or on security features of its user protocols.

    Mechanisms for reducing the risk of blind denial-of-service attacks
    and masquerade attacks are built into SCTP protocol. See RFC2960,
    section 11 for detailed information.

    Currently the IPSEC working group is investigating the support of
    multihoming by IPSEC protocols. At the present time to use IPSEC,
    one must use 2 * N * M security associations if one endpoint uses N
    addresses and the other M addresses.
