   This document provides guidelines of applicability statements for
   Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs). The document
   is intended as guidelines to assist the development of applicability
   statements for each specific PPVPN approach.

1.2 Where does it fit in the Picture of the Sub-IP Work

   This document fits in ppvpn WG.

1.3 Why is it Targeted at this WG

   As this document describes the contents for the following work item
   from the ppvpn WG charter:

   "An applicability statement will be developed for each approach that
   describes the environments in which the approaches are suitable for
   deployment, including analysis of scaling impact of the approach on
   SPs and threat analysis. "

   This document is intended as guidelines to assist the development of
   applicability statement documents for each specific PPVPN approach.

(*)We do not need justification as this document directly
     fits in ppvpn WG.

2. Introduction (*** Objective and Scope ***)

   *** What is this document? ***

   This document is intended as guidelines to assist the development of
   applicability statement documents for each specific PPVPN solution.
   Towards this end, it provides a high level discussion of the
   applicability and limitations of PPVPNs and identifies a list of
   PPVPN requirements. Individual Applicability Statements may associate
   the applicability and limitations of the specific solution with this
   list of requirements. In this respect, this document may also help
   providers and users to define the applicability scenarios of each
   PPVPN solution and to position it against a set of requirements.

   *** Terminology (PPVPN, L3/L2 VPNs, technical approaches)***

   The term "PPVPNs" refers to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for which
   the service provider participates in management and provisioning of
   the VPN, and there are multiple different types of PPVPNs. From the
   customer's layer viewpoint, PPVPNs are classified into two
   categories, layer 3 VPNs and layer 2 VPNs. Multiple technical
   approaches are possible in both categories (e.g. BGP VPNs as defined
   in [2547bis], VR VPNs as defined in [VPN-VR] or [2917bis] are

   approaches included in layer 3 VPNs). This document provides a
   description of these individual approaches in Section 3. For more
   detail on definitions of all technical terms mentioned in this
   paragraph, see [VPN-FR].

   *** Scope and organization of this draft, and scope expected in
       each individual AS draft ***

   Section 3 provides technical overview of each PPVPN approach to
   facilitate understanding of applicability and limitations content.
   Section 4 outlines requirements for PPVPNs as a basic list for
   discussing applicability and limitations. The same list may be used
   for individual AS documents to be developed in future.  Section 5
   presents applicability of PPVPNs and Section 6 presents limitations
   of PPVPNs. Section 7 is for security considerations, section 8 for
   references. This document focuses on discussion common to all
   approaches, however, it may play an introductory role toward
   individual AS documents to be developed in future. Detailed
   applicability and limitations sections are expected to be developed
   in these individual AS documents.

3. PPVPN technical overview

   *** Brief overview of PPVPN types ***

   This section provides a brief overview on the various types of PPVPNs
   as an introductory guidance toward discussions in the rest of this
   document and in developing individual AS documents. Individual
   solution-specific AS documents are expected to include more detailed
   technical overview of the respective solution.
   Note: As some of the engineering tradeoffs between different types of
   PPVPNs, this document will discuss them in a further version.

   First of all, PPVPNs may be distinguished by the service layer
   offered.

   - Layer 3 VPNs

     In a layer 3 VPN service, a customer site receives IP layer (i.e.,
     layer 3) service from the SP. The CE and PE are adjacent to each
     other at the data link layer and the IP layer across the access
     network. The PE performs forwarding of user data packets based on
     information in the IP layer header, such as an IPv4 or IPv6
     destination address. The CE sees the PE as a layer 3 device such as
     an IPv4 or IPv6 router.

   - Layer 2 VPNs




Sumimoto                 Expires February 2002                  [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           August 31, 2001


     In a layer 2 VPN service, a CE receives data link layer (i.e.,
     layer 2) service from the SP. The CE and PE are adjacent to each
     other at the data link layer and not at the IP layer across the
     access network. A PE performs forwarding of user data packets based
     on information in the packets' data link layer headers, such as a
     frame relay DLCI or 802.1q VLAN tag. That is, the CE sees the PE as
     a layer 2 device such as a FR switch or an Ethernet VLAN switch.

   Both layer 3 VPNs and layer 2 VPNs include various technical
   approaches. Specific approaches of layer 3 VPNs include BGP-VPNs as
   defined in [2547bis], virtual routers (VRs) as defined in [VPN-VR] or
   [2917bis]. Specific approaches of layer 2 VPNs include port-based
   VPNs (i.e., where the SP provides a Layer 2 interface, such as Frame
   Relay or ATM, to the VPN customer, while using IP-based mechanisms in
   the provider infrastructure to improve scalability and
   configurability over traditional L2 networks). All types of PPVPNs
   adopt some tunneling mechanisms in SP networks based on IP protocol,
   and service providers participate in management and provisioning of
   the PPVPNs. This is part of the requirements mentioned in following
   section.

4. Outline of requirements for PPVPNs

   *** Why and how does this document outline requirements? ***

   This section briefly outlines main requirements for PPVPNs provided
   in [VPN-REQ] as a basic list for discussing applicability and
   limitations in following sections. Detailed requirements are out of
   the scope of this document, detailed requirements are fully presented
   in [VPN-REQ]. This section classifies the requirements into 3
   categories, general requirements (for both layer 3 and layer 2 VPNs),
   requirements specifically for layer 3 VPNs, and requirements
   specifically for layer 2 VPNs. Above distinction is just a suggestion
   to be discussed.  Concept we want to raise here is that we should
   classify requirements according to the most appropriate way to
   develop individual AS documents.  Apart from customer/service
   provider requirement distinction, a more extended  classification
   could be :
      - general requirements,
      - service-specific requirements(L3 NB, L3 CE-based, L2 NB
        point-to-point, L2 NB transparent LAN service, etc.), basically
        following current framework/req ID taxonomy
      - solution-specific requirements, or approach-specific
        requirements
       (we may have in theory more than one solution per each approach)

   *** Concrete list of the requirements: 4.1 - 4.3 ***

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           August 31, 2001


4.1 General requirements

   - Security (including threat analysis as mentioned in charter)

     Each PPVPN solution should support a range of security related
     features.  Lower levels of security service, like traffic
     isolation, and higher levels of security services, like edge-to-
     edge encryption, authentication, or replay attack prevention should
     be supported. Furthermore, firewall functionality may be desired
     when Internet access is provided.

   - QoS and SLA support

     With regards to QoS support, a PPVPN shall be able to support QoS
     in one or more of the following standard modes:
        - Best Effort  (support mandatory for all PPVPN types)
        - Aggregate CE Interface Level QoS (i.e., hose level)
        - Site-to-site, or _pipe_ model QoS
        - Intserv (i.e., RSVP) signaled
        - Diffserv marked
        - Across packet-switched access networks

   - Manageability (including ease of monitoring/accounting)

     An SP and its customers must be able to manage the capabilities and
     characteristics of their VPN services. To the greatest possible
     extent, automated operations and interoperability with standard
     management platforms should be supported.

   - Interoperability

     Each technical solution should support the Internet standards (in
     terms of compatibility and modularity). Multi-vendor
     interoperability at network element, network and service levels
     among different implementations of the same technical solution
     should be guaranteed (that will likely rely on the completeness of
     the corresponding standard). This is a central requirement for SPs
     and customers. The technical solution must be multi-vendor
     interoperable not only within the SP network infrastructure, but
     also with the customer's network equipment and services making
     usage of the PPVPN service.
     (To be completed.)

   - Scalability (convergence time, routing tables, VPN size, routing
     instances, etc)

     Routing updates in VPNs shall not affect the stability of the SP
     network. Relation with parameters provided in 5.1.1 [PPVPN-REQ]

   - Learning VPN Related Information (*** Needed? ***)

   - Reliability (Including Protection/Restoration)

     (To be filled out.)

   - Network environment

     Functions required to PEs:
     Some PPVPN types or approaches require special functions to PEs.
     The less such special functions are, the easier to deploy.
     (To be completed.)

   - Support of various service scenarios (inter-AS, wholesale,
     Internet access, extranet, etc.)

     (To be filled out.)

   - Support of various connectivity scenarios (access network
     connectivity, etc.)

     (To be filled out.)

   - Topology

     A PPVPN should support arbitrary, customer agent defined inter-site
     connectivity, ranging, for example, from hub-and-spoke, partial
     mesh to full mesh topology.

   - Operation/Deployment considerations(Includes adding/moving sites)

     Ease of Operation/Deployment is highly desired. Special skill for
     operation/deployment may be an obstacle.
     (To be completed.)

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           August 31, 2001


     There should be no restriction on the routing protocols used
     between CE and PE routers, or between CE routers. At least the
     following protocols must be supported: static routing, IGP, such as
     RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, or BGP.
     (To be completed.)

   - Cost considerations

     (To be filled out.)

4.2 Requirements specifically for Layer 3 VPNs

   - Addressing

     The following support from PPVPN solutions are required:
        o globally unique/private IP addresses, IPv4/IPv6, for both
          unicast and multicast
        o obtained by the customer from IANA / statically assigned by
          the PPVPN service provider
        o on-demand, dynamically assigned IP addresses (e.g., DHCP),
          irrespective of whether the access is temporary (e.g.,
          remote) or permanent (i.e., dedicated)
     Customer VPN address overlapping shall be supported - IP addresses
     have to be unique only within a given VPN, but not across VPNs.  In
     the case where private IP addresses are used, a PPVPN solution must
     provide a means for an SP to translate such addresses to public IP
     addresses for communication with other VPNs using overlapping
     addresses, or the Internet.

   - Interworking with other solutions

     Service interworking among different solutions providing PPVPN
     services is highly desirable and should be supported in an as much
     as possible scalable manner.

   - Provisioning Value-Added Service Access

     (To be filled out.)

5. Applicability

   *** Applicability description of identified solutions ***

   - Security

     All of PPVPN approaches (BGP-VPNs, VR, port-based VPNs) achieve
     logical traffic isolation by adopting VPN tunnels operated by
     service providers. If IPsec (or other encryption mechnism) is used
     as tunneling mechanism or used over VPN tunnels, confidentiality,
     integrity, authentication, and replay attack prevention can be
     achieved.
     (To be completed.)

   - QoS support/SLA support

     (To be written.)

   - Manageability

     Defining MIBs for BGP-VPNs approach are on progress.  VR approach-
     specific MIBs are on progress. MIBs for the port-based VPN
     approaches are not currently defined (some work in pwe3 WG may be
     used for that). Detailed descriptions are expected to be included
     in each AS document per technical solution.

   - Interoperability
