              draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-msd-04

Abstract

   This document defines a way for a Border Gateway Protocol Link-State
   (BGP-LS) speaker to advertise multiple types of supported Maximum SID
   Depths (MSDs) at node and/or link granularity.

   Such advertisements allow logically centralized entities (e.g.,
   centralized controllers) to determine whether a particular SID stack
   can be supported in a given network.

1.  Introduction

   When Segment Routing tunnels are computed by a centralized
   controller, it is critical that the controller learns the MSD
   "Maximum SID Depth" of the node or link SR tunnel exits over, so the
   SID stack depth of a path computed doesn't exceed the number of SIDs
   the node is capable of imposing.  This document describes how to use
   BGP-LS to signal the MSD of a node or link to a centralized
   controller.

   PCEP SR extensions draft [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] signals MSD
   in SR PCE Capability TLV and METRIC Object.  However, if PCEP is not
   supported/configured on the head-end of a SR tunnel or a Binding-SID
   anchor node and controller does not participate in IGP routing, it
   has no way to learn the MSD of nodes and links which has been
   configured.  BGP-LS [RFC7752] defines a way to expose topology and

   associated attributes and capabilities of the nodes in that topology
   to a centralized controller.

   Other types of MSD are known to be useful.  For example,
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-mpls-elc] and [I-D.ietf-isis-mpls-elc] define Readable
   Label Depth Capability (RLDC) that is used by a head-end to insert an
   Entropy Label (EL) at a depth that can be read by transit nodes.

   Gateway Protocol

   MSD: Maximum SID Depth

   PCC: Path Computation Client

   PCE: Path Computation Element

   PCEP: Path Computation Element Protocol

1.1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here .

2.  Problem Statement

   In existing technology only PCEP has extension to signal the MSD (SR
   PCE Capability TLV/ METRIC Object as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing],If PCEP is not supported by the node
   (head-end of the SR tunnel) controller has no way to learn the MSD of
   the node/link configured.  OSPF and IS-IS extensions are defined in:

   [RFC8476], [RFC8491]

3.  MSD supported by a node

   Node MSD is encoded in a new Node Attribute TLV, as defined in
   [RFC7752]

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Sub-Type and Value ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ...

                      Figure 1: Node attribute format

   Type : A 2-octet field specifying code-point of the new TLV type.
   Code-point:(TBD1) from BGP-LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor,
   Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute TLVs registry

   Length: A 2-octet field that indicates the length of the value
   portion

   Sub-Type and value fields are as defined in corresponding OSPF
   [RFC8476] and IS-IS [RFC8491] extensions.

4.  MSD supported on a link

   Link MSD is encoded in a New Link Attribute TLV, as defined in
   [RFC7752]

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Sub-Type and Value ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ...

                      Figure 2: Link attribute format

   Type : A 2-octet field specifying code-point of the new TLV type.
   Code-point:(TBD2) from BGP-LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor,
   Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute TLVs registry

   Length: A 2-octet field that indicates the length of the value
   portion

   Sub-Type and value fields are as defined in corresponding OSPF
   [RFC8476] and IS-IS [RFC8491] extensions.

5.  IANA Considerations

   We request IANA assign code points from the registry BGP-LS Node
   Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute TLVs,
   as follows: TLV Code Point Description IS-IS TLV/Sub-TLV Reference
   TBD1 Node MSD 242/23 (this document) TBD2 Link MSD
   (22,23,25,141,222,223)/15 (this document)

6.  Security Considerations

   The advertisement of an incorrect MSD value may have negative
   consequences.  If the value is smaller than supported, path
   computation may fail to compute a viable path.  If the value is
   larger than supported, an attempt to instantiate a path that can't be
   supported by the head-end (the node performing the SID imposition)
   may occur.  The presence of this information may also inform an
   attacker of how to induce any of the aforementioned conditions.

   This document does not introduce security issues beyond those
   discussed in [RFC7752], [RFC8476] and [RFC8491]
