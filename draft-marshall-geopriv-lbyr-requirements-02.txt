1.  Introduction

   Any location-based service which utilizes SIP signaling, needs to
   have some form of location information available, to serve as the
   basis of performing a location-based mapping operation in order to
   know where to route.  To enable any location-based service, whether
   for an end device or middlebox, (e.g., SIP Proxy), location must be
   acquired, either directly or indirectly, location information, either
   in the form of a PIDF-LO or a Location Reference Identifier.

   This document defines the requirements for a Location-by-Reference
   mechanism, its use, and its alternatives.  It contrasts the Location-
   by-Reference routing model to the Location-by-Value model, and
   describes the ways in which a Location-by-Reference mechanism is
   used, such as for requesting a reference, resolving a reference, and
   conveying a reference.

   The document also talks about the two primary network models which
   may use Location-by-Reference, "Edge" routed and "Proxy" routed
   scenarios.

   When describing the use of location within messaging, it is essential
   to discuss the scope of how location is handled within this document.
   We talk about how location is 'acquired', or 'configured' within a
   host, but we do not address the mechanisms involved in
   'determinining' (i.e., the methods or process of coming up with the
   location information).

   The action of passing location from one entity to another entity
   along a SIP signaling path is referred to as "conveyance", and is
   discussed separately from that of configuration.  The commonly used
   example of a SIP-based emergency call may include both elements of
   configuration and conveyance, in order to be able to appropriately
   route and deliver location to an IP-enabled PSAP.

   Location determination, which may include the processes of manual
   provisioning, automated measurements, or derivation steps (e.g., geo-
   coding/reverse geo-coding), is out of scope for this document.

   A detailed description and usage guidelines for Location-by-Value are
   out of scope in this document.

   This document identifies the individual requirements underlying how a
   Location-by-Reference (LbyR) mechanism is to be used over the
   Internet, applied to either a Dereference protocol, Conveyance
   protocol, or a Configuration protocol.

   For an application of LbyR, we often cite the use case of a SIP-based



Marshall                Expires January 10, 2008                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          GEOPRIV LbyR Requirements              July 2007


   signaling to emergency services, though we also talk about LbyR in a
   more general sense.  In this case, a SIP user agent, or SIP proxy
   server acting on behalf of a user agent, to another user agent via
   the SIP protocol [RFC3261].  In place of the actual value for a
   "Location", a Location Reference URI is used to indirectly represent
   the location via a dereference step.  Stored in some Internet-
   connected host, which we call a Location Configuration Server (LCS).

   In the LbyR context, the Configuration protocol mechanism is used to
   fetch a location reference, and in this case, the protocols which
   have been identified for this use, includes DHCP, LLDP-MED, HELD, and
   potentially, SUPL.  Regardless of protocol choices, the underlying
   approach to how LbyR is used for configuration is not specific to any
   particular protocol choice.

   A Location which is referenced can be either Coordinate location [RFC
   3693] (e.g., lat/lon), or a Civic location (e.g., street address).

   We reintroduce a few of the building blocks to location [RFC3693]
   into the LbyR discussion.  Included in this list is the "target", the
   entity whose location is transmitted, (e.g., UA location).  A "using
   protocol", defined as how a "target" (in this model) transmits a
   "location reference identifier" to a "location recipient".  Privacy
   of a target's location, with repect to user identity is important to
   protect.  Therefore, any examples shown will assume that any user
   identity associated with the target is not included with location.

   Location can be pushed from one host to another, via a conveyance
   protocol, as part of a signaling protocol, in order to be used for
   location-based routing (or other purposes, outside the scope here),
   or it can alternatively be queried via a client request to a server
   which provides location [ref. draft-sip-conveyance- XXX].  In the
   case of LbyR Conveyance, the actual location (i.e., location object)
   never gets pushed along, but is replaced by a Location Reference
   Identifier.  In the case of a client which queries a server for
   location, the query is either to obtain a Location Reference
   Identifier, or to obtain an actual Location (e.g., location object)
   based the input of an LRI in the query.

   The draft-sip-conveyance- document [draft-sip-conveyance] details how
   SIP proxies treat LbyR (and LbyV) scenarios for conveying location
   via the SIP protocol.

   Whereas location objects are readily consumable by the hosts that
   using protocols deliver to, a Location Reference ID must first go
   through a dereference step in order to be useful.

   In our SIP example, for LbyR, instead of having a content identifier

   (cid:) pointing to a location object within a SIP body, the LRI is
   carried in the Geolocation header of a SIP message which is used to
   get a location via a dereference step.

   The structure of this document first defines terminology in
   Section 3.  Then a short discussion on actors, Section 5.  Routing
   models, considering both "Edge" and "Proxy" routed models are shown
   by example, Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively, followed by a more
   specific model which shows a Layer 7 LCP context model.
   [Placeholders for...]  More models are included for comparison,
   including those for LbyR by DHCP, LLDP-MED, and by SUPL.  A high-
   level list of baseline requirements are outlined for the LbyR
   mechanism, (Section 11), and generally apply to configuration,
   dereferencing, and conveyance of location by means of a Location
   Reference Identifier in lieu of the an actual location, as would
   otherwise be included within a PIDF-LO structure.

   Any detailed discussion of Identification information about the
   caller, subscriber, or device, as associated information to location
   or a location reference, for either Conveyance, Dereference, or
   Configuration, is out of scope in this document.

3.  Terminology

3.1.  Terms

   Several of the terms presented below are based on RFC3693, and in
   some cases, extended to include additional language to support the
   Location-by-Reference model.

   Dereference Protocol:  A protocol which is used to query a Location
      Configuration Server based on an LRI as input, and which returns a
      location value (.e.g, PIDF-LO).

   Location Reference Identifier (LRI):  An identifier which serves as a
      pointer to a target's location record on a remote host (e.g.,
      location configuration server), and is used by a dereferencing
      protocol for retrieval of the associated specific location.

   LoST Server:  A network entity which provides a URI response based on
      input of a location and service identifier [ref.
      draft-ecrit-lost-].

   Using Protocol:  A protocol (e.g., SIP) which carries a Location
      Object or an Location Reference Identifier.

   Target:  A person, end device, or other entity whose location is
      communicated by a Geopriv Location Object.

   Location Recipient (LR):  The entity that receives location
      information.  It may have asked for this location explicitly (by
      sending a query containing an LRI to a location configuration
      server), or it may receive this location asynchronously.

   Location Server (LS):  The entity to which a LG publishes location
      objects, is the recipient of queries from location recipients, and
      is the entity that applies rules designed by the Rule Maker (RM)
      [ref.  RFC4119].  Also may be referred to as a Presence Server
      (PS).

   Location Configuration Server (LCS):  The entity which receives a
      client request for either location or a location reference.  In
      the latter case, also performs the dereference function for a
      Location Refernce Identifier, in the context of the Location-by-
      Reference model.  May also be referred to as a Location
      Information Server (LIS).

Internet-Draft          GEOPRIV LbyR Requirements              July 2007


   Location:  Either a coordinate (geographic) identification assigned
      to a region or feature based on a specific coordinate system, or
      by other identifiable information such as a street number and
      street name within a civic location reference system.

   Civic location:  A described location based on some understood
      location reference system, such a jurisdictions or postal delivery
      grid.  A street address valid within the USPS system is a common
      example.

   Coordinate location:  A reference to a point which is able to be
      located as described by a set of defined coordinates within a
      geographic coordinate system, such as latitude and longitude
      within the WGS-84 datum.  For example, 2-D geographic location is
      defined as an (x,y) coordinate value pair according to the
      distance north or south of the equator and east or west of the
      prime meridian.

   Location-by-Value:  The mechanism of representing location either in
      conveyance protocols or configuration protocols as fully
      specified, (i.e., including the actual location value itself).

   Location-by-Reference:  The mechanism of representing location either
      in conveyance protocols or configuration protocols as an
      identifier which refers to a fully specified location, (i.e.,
      including a pointer to the actual location value itself).

4.  Routing Models

   This document describes the two primary network models which may use
   Location-by-Reference, these are often referred to as either "Edge"
   routed or "Proxy" routed messaging.

   Since Location-by-Value is an alternative approach which deals with
   acquiring and conveying location information directly, and in the
   general case where LbyV does not include a Location Reference
   Identifier, LbyV is deemed out of scope in this document, except
   where noted, and so the following examples will only deal with LbyR
   scenarios.

   1.  The Edge routed model consists of the end device acquiring a
       location reference identifier, dereferencing the LRI, and
       performing the routing based on the dereferenced location.
       Location information might be generated by the end host itself,
       in which case the end host itself may request a location
       reference identifier, based on its location, from the LCS.

   2.  The Proxy routed approach relies on some kind of middlebox (e.g.,
       Proxy) inserting an LRI into the SIP messaging, and would be
       required for non-location-aware end devices.  In this case,
       location information might be generated by, provisioned into, or
       stored by the LCS, and represented to the end device as a
       location reference identifier, delivered via a location
       configuration protocol (e.g., using DHCP, LLDP-MED, or an L7 LCP.

   The Location Reference Identifier is useful to point to a location
   value or mask the actual location value.  Since possessing the LRI
   alone is insufficient to perform location-based routing, the LRI must
   be de-referenced.  Once the location is de-referenced and returned to
   the location recipient, it can then be used as input to some
   location-based service (e.g., LoST).

      Uses the location to determine routing instructions in the form of
      a destination URI (step not shown)

      (c) Conveys the LRI to the destination URI obtained in the

      Use the location to determine routing instructions in the form of

6.  LbyR Actions

   The LbyR mechanism has three distinct actions which describe its use.

   1.  An LRI is 'acquired' via a Configuration protocol request/
       response (which implies its creation and receipt).  This action
       is performed by the entity which needs the location reference to
       resolve it via the dereference step, then send it on to the next
       destination (conveyance).

   2.  An LRI 'resolved', via a Dereferencing protocol request/response.
       This is the action of exchanging the reference for an actual
       location.

   3.  An LRI is 'pushed' via a Conveyance protocol mechanism.  This
       action is accomplished by a using protocol, such as SIP, in which

   Note: An LRI may also be conveyed alongside a PIDF-LO, (which enables
   the Terminating UAS a convenient mechanism to perform location
   updates).

7.  LbyR via L7LCP

      Location-by-Reference with Location Subscriptions

      In mobile wireless networks it is not efficient for the end host
      to periodically query the LCS for up-to-date location information.
      Furthermore, the end host might want to delegate the task of
      retrieving and publishing location information to a third party,
      such as a presence server.  Finally, in some deployments the
      network operator might not want to make location information
      available to the end hosts.

      These usage scenarios motivated the introduction of the
      location-by- reference concept.  Depending on the type of
      reference, such as HTTP/ HTTPS or SIP presence URI, different
      operations can be performed.  While an HTTP/HTTPS URI can be
      resolved to location information, a SIP presence URI provides
      further benefits from the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY concept that can
      additionally be combined with location filters [13].

      The following list describes the location subscription idea:

      1.  The end host discovers the LCS.

      2.  The end host sends a request to the LCS asking for a
      location-by- reference, as shown in (1) of Figure 4.

      3.  The LCS responds to the request and includes a location object
      together with a subscription URI.

      4.  The Target puts the subscription URI into a SIP message as
      described in [14] forwards it to a Location Recipient, as shown in
      (2) of Figure 4.  The Location Recipient subscribes to the
      obtained subscription URI (see (3) of Figure 4) and potentially
      uses a location filter (see [13]) to limit the notification rate.

      5.  If the Target moves outside a certain area, indicated by the
      location filter, then the Location Recipient will receive a
      notification.

      Note that the Target may also act in the role of the Location
      Recipient whereby it would subscribe to its own location
      information.  For example, the Target obtains a subscription URI
      from the Geopriv-L7 protocol.  It subscribes to the URI in order
      to obtain its currently location information, which then serves as
      input to a LoST query (see [15]) in order to acquire the service
      boundary (e.g., PSAP boundary).  The service boundary indicates
      the region where the device can move without the need to re-query
      since the returned answer remains unchanged.  The Target uses this
      service boundary to location filters and updates the subscription.
      If the Target moves outside a certain area, indicated by the
      location filter, it will receive a notification and knows that re-
      querying LoST to obtain a new service boundary is necessary.

      For location-by-reference, the LCS needs to maintain a list of
      randomized URIs for each host, timing out these URIs after the
      reference expires.  References need to expire to prevent the
      recipient of such a URL from being able to (in some cases)
      permanently track a host.  Furthermore, this mechanism also offers
      garbage collection capability for the LIS.

      Location references must prevent adversaries from obtaining the
      Target's location.  There are at least two approaches: The
      location reference contains a random component and allows any
      holder of the reference to obtain location information.
      Alternatively, the reference can be public and the LIS performs
      access control via a separate authentication mechanism, such as
      HTTP digest or TLS client side authentication, when resolving the

11.  High-Level Requirements

   Below, we summarize high-level design requirements needed for a
   location-by-reference mechanism.

   Rq1.  Location Reference Identifier as a URI:  The dereferencing
      protocol MUST support an LRI in URI form, and may support other
      non-URI forms.

   Rq2.  Dereference Protocol Confidentiality:  The dereferencing
      protocol MUST support mechanisms for encrypting messages sent
      between client (Location recipient) and server (Location
      Configuration Server).

   Rq3.  Dereference Protocol Transparancy:  The dereferencing protocol
      MUST support the exchange of messages without encryption (i.e., in
      plaintext).

      Motivation: In the case where encrypted message exchange is
      unsuccessful, there must be a way to try to dereference a location
      reference identifier with less restriction (e..g., in the
      emergency service case, where every call always needs answered).

   Rq4.  Location Reference Expiration:  The Location Reference
      mechanism MUST provide a way to limit the validity of that
      reference (and SHOULD also provide a way to extend or shorten the
      validity period).

      Motivation: Location references are not intended to represent a
      location forever, and the identifier eventually may need to be
      recycled, or may be subject to a specific window of validity,
      after which the location reference fails to yield a location, or
      the location is determined to be kept confidential.  An expiry
      timer for a location reference ensures that the location reference
      becomes invalid based on configuration.

   Rq5.  Dereference Protocol Transport:  The dereference protocol MUST
      support TCP/IP and MAY support UDP/IP.

      Motivation: Practical, near-term deployment issues may make TCP/IP
      implementations unachievable.

   Rq6''.  Dereference Protocol Authentication:  The The Location
      dereferencing protocol MUST support both client-side and server-
      side authentication between server and client.

Internet-Draft          GEOPRIV LbyR Requirements              July 2007


      Motivation: It is reasonable to expect implementations of
      authentication to vary.  Some implementations may choose to
      support both client-side and server-side authentication, might
      support one only, or may support neither.

   Rq7.  Location Privacy:  The Location Reference MUST NOT reveal any
      personal identification information along with a requested
      location object.

   Rq8.  Dereferenced PIDF-LO Result:  The dereferencing of an LRI MUST
      result in a well-formed PIDF-LO.

      Motivation: This is in order to ensure adequate privacy rules can
      be adhered to, since the PIDF-LO format comprises the necessary
      structures to maintain location privacy.

   Rq9.  Time Limitation:  The reference MUST be valid for a limited
      amount of time.

      Motivation:

   Rq10. :  The reference MUST be hard to guess, i.e., it MUST contain a
      cryptographically random component.

      Motivation:

   Rq11. :  The reference MUST NOT contain any information that
      identifies the user, device or address of record.

      Motivation:

   Rq12. :  The Location Recipient MUST be able to resolve the reference
      more than once (i.e., there is no implicit limit on the number of
      dereferencing actions).

      Motivation:

   Rq13. :  Possessing a reference to location information allows a
      Location Recipient to repeately obtain the latest information
      about the Target with the same granularity.

      Motivation:

   Rq14. :  The Target MUST be able to resolve the reference itself.

12.  Security Considerations

   The LbyR mechanism currently addresses security issues as follows.

   1.  A pawn ticket where possession implies permission, and

   2.  Identifiers that are public which are protected by privacy rules
       at the dereference server.

   3.  Additional security issues will be discussed in a separate
       geopriv document (based on a prior version of the l7-lcp-ps
       draft).
