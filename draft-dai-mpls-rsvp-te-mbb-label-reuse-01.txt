                      MPLS RSVP-TE MBB Label Reuse
               draft-dai-mpls-rsvp-te-mbb-label-reuse-01

Abstract

   The concept of "make-before-break (MBB)" while rerouting MPLS RSVP-TE
   tunnels is discussed in [RFC3209].  In the procedure that is
   outlined, the behaviour of downstream label assignment for the new
   LSP (new tunnel instance) is not well defined.  As a general
   practice, a different label is assigned by each downstream router and
   advertised to the upstream router in the RESV message for the new
   LSP; this results in a separate end-to-end data-plane path for the
   new LSP (with the exception of PHP LSPs or UHP LSP with explicit
   label on the last hop).  The consequence of this practice is that the
   label entry gets added/deleted in the LFIB at every non-ingress
   router along the LSP path during MBB.  Also, the ingress router would
   need to update all the applications using this LSP when switching to
   the new tunnel instance, as the new tunnel instance uses different
   outgoing label.  This in turn may also cause other elements of the
   network which are dependant on the LSP to do the update.

   Such network churn can be avoided or reduced if the same label can
   be re-used (kept intact) wherever it is affecting neither the routing
   functionalities nor the data path verification of each instance.
   This document proposes a set of procedures to facilitate label reuse
   when there is a total or partial path overlap between the two tunnel
   instances during MBB.

Internet-Draft        MPLS RSVP-TE MBB Label Reuse        September 2015


1.  Introduction

   MPLS RSVP-TE make-before-break (MBB) procedure is defined in
   [RFC3209].  The behaviour of downstream label assignment for the new
   LSP (new tunnel instance) is not well-defined in this procedure.  In
   most MBB implementations, a different label is assigned by each
   downstream router and advertised to upstream router in the RESV
   message for the new Label Switched Path (LSP).  This means a separate
   end-to-end data-plane path for the new tunnel instance (with the
   exception of PHP LSPs or UHP LSPs with explicit NULL label at the
   last hop).  Although this allows for independent end-to-end path
   verification for each tunnel instance, it requires an LFIB entry add/
   delete at every non-ingress router along the path of the LSP during
   MBB even if the paths for the new tunnel instance and the old tunnel
   instance might be partially or totally overlapping.  Label reuse
   under partial or total overlap condition reduces unnecessary LFIB
   update, reduces the possibility of errors and improves network
   convergence latency.  In addition, whenever label is reused, the
   setup time for the new tunnel instance would be faster because there
   is no need for the transit routers along the path of the new LSP to
   wait for the new LFIB entry to be added.

1.1.  Common LSP MBB triggers

   The MBB procedure can be triggered because of a change to any
   property of the RSVP-TE tunnel.  The most common case is a change to
   the bandwidth requirement, especially with the widely implemented
   auto-bandwidth feature, which dynamically adjusts the LSP bandwidth
   based on traffic-monitoring feedback.  With CSPF commonly used to
   compute path to meet the new bandwidth requirements, it is possible
   that the existing path is still one of the best paths which can
   satisfy the new requirements.  This provides the opportunity to reuse
   labels to achieve the benefits described.  If given the choice and
   the goal of selecting the best path is not the highest priority, CSPF
   can also prefer the existing path to other possible paths to take
   full advantage of the label reuse as long as the requirements are
   still met by the existing path.

2.  Recommended conditions for label reuse

   The notion of "Label reuse" can be applied for both point-to-point
   (P2P) LSP and point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSP, but due to the
   complexity of P2MP and many possible variations of the solutions,
   this document will only focus on the recommendations for P2P LSPs.

   Labels can be reused when the primary paths of the two tunnel
   instances have complete overlap starting from a certain point in the
   paths and going all the way to the egress router of the LSP.  The

   best case scenario is complete overlap of the two paths end to end;
   in which case there is no need for any label changes and LFIB
   updates, both in the transit as well as in the ingress routers.
   Existing data plane verification method can be used to verify new
   tunnel instance as before.  Data traversing on either instance will
   take a different label path from the ingress to this transit router
   and from then on the traffic will merge into the shared label
   switched path towards the egress router.

   The conditions under which label reuse can be applied are as
   following:

   o  Egress router of LSP: Reuse-label functionality can always be
      applied.

   o  Transit routers of the LSP: For any given transit router of P2P
      LSP, label can be reused if the following conditions are met:

      (a)  Downstream label received is the same

      (b)  NHOP is the same

   o  Ingress router of the LSP: When the same conditions as listed
      under transit router are met, instead of no label change, there is
      no need for ingress route update for LSP to applications depending
      on it.

   The label reuse procedure starts from the egress of the LSP as RESV
   traverses upstream towards the ingress of the LSP; it terminates at
   the first transit router where paths of the two tunnel instances
   diverge towards the ingress of the LSP or at the transit router which
   doesn't support label reuse.

3.  Control of label-reuse behaviour

3.1.  Enable/Disable label-reuse capability

   This document recommends enabling "label-reuse" capability by
   default.  Allow it to be disabled if needed by changing
   configuration.

3.2.  Prefer overlapping path to facilitate label-reuse

   In order to take full advantage of the label-reuse capability, path
   computation for the new tunnel instance may seek to maximize path
   overlap.  This can be achieved through two approaches.

   o  The first approach is to select from the best paths available the
      path which has the most path overlap with the existing path
      starting from the egress router.

   o  The second approach is to prefer the existing path if it still
      satisfies the new requirement, even though it might not be the
      best path.

   The choice between the approaches is a matter of local computation
   policy and can be different for different types of MBB trigger.
