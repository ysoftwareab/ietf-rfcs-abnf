Use of Short-Term, Automatically-Renewed (STAR) Certificates to Delegate
                        Authority over Web Sites
                        draft-ietf-acme-star-00

Abstract

   This memo proposes an ACME extension to enable the issuance of short-
   term and automatically renewed certificates.  This allows a domain
   name owner to delegate the use of certificates to another party,
   while retaining the capability to cancel this delegation at any time
   with no need to rely on certificate revocation mechanisms.

1.  Introduction: A Solution for the HTTPS CDN Use Case

   A content provider (referred to in this document as Domain Name
   Owner, DNO) has agreements in place with one or more Content Delivery
   Networks (CDNs) that are contracted to serve its content over HTTPS.
   The CDN terminates the HTTPS connection at one of its edge cache
   servers and needs to present its clients (browsers, set-top-boxes) a
   certificate whose name matches the authority of the URL that is
   requested, i.e. that of the DNO.  However, many DNOs balk at sharing
   their long-term private keys with another organization and, equally,
   CDN providers would rather not have to handle other parties' long-
   term secrets.  This problem has been discussed at the IETF under the
   LURK (limited use of remote keys) title.

   This document proposes a solution to the above problem that involves
   the use of short-term certificates with a DNO's name on them, and a
   scheme for handling the naming delegation from the DNO to the CDN.
   The generated short-term credentials are automatically renewed by an
   ACME Certification Authority (CA) [I-D.ietf-acme-acme] and routinely
   rotated by the CDN on its edge cache servers.  The DNO can end the
   delegation at any time by simply instructing the CA to stop the
   automatic renewal and let the certificate expire shortly thereafter.

   Using short-term certificates makes revocation cheap and effective
   [Topalovic] [I-D.iab-web-pki-problems] in case of key compromise or
   of termination of the delegation; seamless certificate issuance and
   renewal enable the level of workflow automation that is expected in
   today's cloud environments.  Also, compared to other keyless-TLS
   solutions [I-D.cairns-tls-session-key-interface]
   [I-D.erb-lurk-rsalg], the proposed approach doesn't suffer from
   scalability issues or increase in connection setup latency, while
   requiring virtually no changes to existing COTS caching software used
   by the CDN.

   This document describes the ACME extension.  A companion document [I-
   D.sheffer-acme-star-request] describes how the CDN can request the
   DNO to initiate the protocol with the ACME server.

1.1.  Cloud Use Case

   A similar use case is that of cloud infrastructure components, such
   as load balancers and Web Application Firewalls (WAF).  These
   components are typically provisioned with the DNO's certificate, and
   similarly to the CDN use case, many organizations would prefer to
   manage the private key only on their own cloud-based or on-premise
   hosts, often on Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).

Internet-Draft                  ACME STAR                      June 2017


   Here again, the STAR solution allows the DNO to delegate authority
   over the domain to the cloud provider, with the ability to revoke
   this authority at any time.

1.2.  Terminology

   DNO  Domain Name Owner, the owner of a domain that needs to be
      delegated.
   NDC  Name Delegation Consumer, the entity to which the domain name is
      delegated for a limited time.  This is often a CDN (in fact,
      readers may note the similarity of the two acronyms).
   CDN  Content Delivery Network, a widely distributed network that
      serves the domain's web content to a wide audience at high
      performance.
   STAR  Short-Term, Automatically Renewed X.509 certificates.
   ACME  The IETF Automated Certificate Management Environment, a
      certificate management protocol.
   CA A Certificate Authority that implements the ACME protocol.

1.3.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Flow

   For clarity, we describe how the proposed ACME extension can be used
   in a system that consists of an NDC, an ACME Client (the DNO) and an
   ACME Server.  Only the latter part (ACME Client to ACME Server) is in
   scope of this document.

   The protocol flow can be split into two: a STAR interface, used by
   NDC and DNO to agree on the name delegation, and the extended ACME
   interface, used by DNO to obtain the short-term and automatically
   renewed certificate from the CA, which is eventually consumed by the
   NDC.  The latter is also used to terminate the delegation, if so
   needed.

   Communication between the NDC and the DNO (the STAR interface) is out
   of scope of this document.  It may take the form described in [I-
   D.sheffer-acme-star-request], some other online protocol, or may even
   be through manual generation of the CSR.

   The following subsections describe the three main phases of the
   protocol:

   o  Bootstrap: the DNO asks an ACME CA to create a corresponding
      short-term and auto-renewed (STAR) certificate, possibly on a
      request from an NDC which is out of scope for this document;
   o  Auto-renewal: the ACME CA periodically re-issues the short-term
      certificate and posts it to a public URL (Section 2.2);
   o  Termination: the DNO (indirectly) stops name delegation by
      explicitly requesting the ACME CA to discontinue the automatic
      renewal of the certificate (Section 2.3).

   This diagram presents the entities involved in the protocol and their
   interactions during the different phases.

2.1.  Bootstrap

   The DNO, in its role as an ACME client, requests the CA to issue a
   STAR certificate, i.e., one that:

   o  Has a short validity (e.g., 24 to 72 hours);
   o  Is automatically renewed by the CA for a certain period of time;
   o  Is downloadable from a (highly available) public link without
      requiring any special authorization.

   Other than that, the ACME protocol flows as normal between DNO and
   CA, in particular DNO is responsible for satisfying the requested
   ACME challenges until the CA is willing to issue the requested
   certificate.  Per normal ACME processing, the DNO is given back an
   Order ID for the issued STAR certificate to be used in subsequent
   interaction with the CA (e.g., if the certificate needs to be
   terminated.)

   The bootstrap phase ends when the DNO obtains the OK from the ACME
   CA.

2.2.  Refresh

   The CA automatically re-issues the certificate (using the same CSR)
   before it expires and publishes it to the URL that the NDC has come
   to know at the end of the bootstrap phase.  The NDC downloads and
   installs it.  This process goes on until either:

   o  DNO terminates the delegation, or
   o  Automatic renewal expires.

2.3.  Termination

   The DNO may request early termination of the STAR certificate by
   including the Order ID in a certificate termination request to the
   ACME interface, defined below.  After the CA receives and verifies
   the request, it shall:

   o  Cancel the automatic renewal process for the STAR certificate;

   o  Change the certificate publication resource to return an error
      indicating the termination of the delegation to external clients,
      including the NDC.

   Note that it is not necessary to explicitly revoke the short-term

3.  Protocol Details

   This section describes the protocol's details, namely the extensions
   to the ACME protocol required to issue STAR certificates.

3.1.  ACME Extensions between Proxy and Server

   This protocol extends the ACME protocol, to allow for recurrent
   orders.

3.1.1.  Extending the Order Resource

   The Order resource is extended with the following attributes:

   These attributes are included in a POST message when creating the
   order, as part of the "payload" encoded object.  They are returned
   when the order has been created, and the ACME server MAY adjust them
   at will, according to its local policy.

3.1.2.  Canceling a Recurrent Order

   An important property of the recurrent Order is that it can be
   cancelled by the domain name owner, with no need for certificate
   revocation.  We use the DELETE message to cancel the Order:

   DELETE /acme/order/1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: acme-server.example.org

   Which returns:

   HTTP/1.1 202 Deleted

   The server MUST NOT issue any additional certificates for this Order,
   beyond the certificate that is available for collection at the time
   of deletion.

3.2.  Indicating Support of Recurrent Orders

   ACME supports sending arbitrary extensions when creating an Order,
   and as a result, there is no need to explicitly indicate support of
   this extension.  The Proxy MUST verify that the "recurrent" attribute
   was understood, as indicated by the "recurrent" attribute included in
   the created Order.  Since the standard ACME protocol does not allow
   to explicitly cancel a pending Order (the DELETE operation above is
   an extension), a Proxy that encounters an non-supporting server will
   probably let the Order expire instead of following through with the
   authorization process.

3.3.  ACME Authorization

   The DNO MUST restrict the authorizations it requests from the ACME
   server to only those that cannot be spoofed by a malicious NDC.  In
   most cases the NDC will have strong control of HTTP content under the

   delegated domain, and therefore HTTPS-based authorization MUST NOT be
   used.  See also Section 5.1.

3.4.  Fetching the Certificates

   The certificate is fetched from the certificate endpoint, as per
   [I-D.ietf-acme-acme], Sec. 7.4.2 "Downloading the Certificate".  The
   server MUST include an Expires header that indicates expiry of the
   specific certificate.  When the certificate expires, the client MAY
   assume that a newer certificate is already in place.

   A certificate MUST be replaced by its successor at the latest halfway
   through its lifetime (the period between its notBefore and notAfter
   times).

4.  Operational Considerations

4.1.  Certificate Transparency (CT) Logs

   TBD: larger logs and how to deal with them.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Restricting CDNs to the Delegation Mechanism

   Currently there are no standard methods for the DNO to ensure that
   the CDN cannot issue a certificate through mechanisms other than the
   one described here, for the URLs under the CDN's control.  For
   example, regardless of the STAR solution, a rogue CDN employee can
   use the ACME protocol (or proprietary mechanisms used by various CAs)
   to create a fake certificate for the DNO's content because ACME
   authorizes its requests using information that may be under the
   adversary's control.

   The best solution currently being worked on would consist of several
   related configuration steps:

   o  Make sure that the CDN cannot modify the DNS records for the
      domain.  Typically this would mean that the content owner
      establishes a CNAME resource record from a subdomain into a CDN-
      managed domain.
   o  Restrict certificate issuance for the domain to specific CAs that
      comply with ACME.  This assumes universal deployment of CAA
      [RFC6844] by CAs, which is not the case yet.  We note that the CA/
      Browser Forum has recently decided to require CAA checking
      [CAB-CAA].
   o  Deploy ACME-specific methods to restrict issuance to a specific
      authorization key which is controlled by the content owner

      [I-D.ietf-acme-caa], and/or to specific ACME authorization
      methods.

   This solution is recommended in general, even if an alternative to
   the mechanism described here is used.
