         BGP Update for 5G Edge Computing Service Metadata
         draft-dunbar-idr-5g-edge-compute-app-meta-data-06

Abstract
   This draft describes a new AppMetaData subTLV carried by
   Tunnel Encap[RFC9012] Path Attribute for egress router to
   advertise the running status and environment for the directly
   attached 5G Edge Computing (EC) servers. The AppMetaData can
   be used by the ingress routers in the 5G Local Data Network to
   make path selection not only based on the routing distance but
   also the running environment of the destinations. The goal is
   to improve latency and performance for 5G EC services.

   The extension enables an EC server at one specific location to
   be more preferred than the others with the same IP address to
   receive data flows from a specific source (UE).

1. Introduction

   This document describes a new subTLV, AppMetaData, for egress
   routers to advertise the running status and environment for
   the directly attached Edge Computing (EC) servers. The
   AppMetaData can be used by the ingress routers in the 5G Local
   Data Network to make path selection not only based on the
   routing distance but also the running environment of the
   destinations. The goal is to improve latency and performance
   for 5G Edge Computing services.

 1.1. 5G Edge Computing Background

   In 5G Edge Computing (EC), one Application can be hosted on
   multiple Servers in different EC data centers that are close
   in proximity. The 5G Local Data Networks (LDN)that connect the
   EC data centers with the 5G Base stations consist of a small
   number of dedicated routers.

   When a User Equipment (UE) initiates application packets using
   the destination address from a DNS reply or its cache, the
   packets from the UE are carried in a PDU session through 5G
   Core [5GC] to the 5G UPF-PSA (User Plan Function - PDU Session
   Anchor). The UPF-PSA decapsulates the 5G GTP outer header and


Dunbar, et al.         Expires August 23, 2022           [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      AppMetaData for 5G EC Service

   forwards the packets from the UEs to its directly connected
   Ingress router of the 5G LDN. The LDN for 5G EC is responsible
   for forwarding the packets to the intended destinations.

   When the UE moves out of coverage of its current gNB (next-
   generation Node B) and anchors to a new gNB, the 5G SMF
   (Session Management Function) could select the same UPF or a
   new UPF for the UE per standard handover procedures described
   in 3GPP TS 23.501 and TS 23.502. If the UE is anchored to a
   new UPF-PSA when the handover process is complete, the packets
   to/from the UE is carried by a GTP tunnel to the new UPF-PSA.
   Per TS 23.501-h20 Section 5.8.2, the UE may maintain its IP
   address when anchored to a new UPF-PSA unless the new UFP-PSA
   belongs to different mobile operators. 5GC may maintain a path
   from the old UPF to the new UPF for a short time for the SSC
   [Session and Service Continuity] mode 3 to make the handover
   process more seamless.


  1.2. 5G Edge Computing Network Properties

   In this document, 5G Edge Computing Network refers to multiple
   Local IP Data Networks (LDN) in one region that interconnect
   the Edge Computing data centers. Those IP LDN networks are the
   N6 interfaces from 3GPP 5G perspective.

   The ingress routers to the 5G Edge Computing Network are the
   routers directly connected to 5G UPFs. The egress routers to
   the 5G Edge Computing [EC] Network are the routers that have a
   direct link to the EC servers. The EC servers and the egress
   routers are co-located. Some of those Edge Computing Data
   centers may have virtual switches or Top of Rack [ToR]
   switches between the egress routers and the servers. But
   transmission delay between the egress routers and the EC
   servers is negligible, which is too small to be considered in
   this document.

   When multiple EC servers are attached to one App Layer Load
   Balancer, only the IP addresses of the App Layer Load Balancer
   are visible to the 5G LDNs. How an App Layer Load balancer
   manages the individual servers is out of the scope of the
   network layer.

   The 5G EC Services are registered premium services that
   require super-low latency and very high SLA. Most services by
   the UEs are not part of the registered 5G EC Services.

   1.3. Problem#1: ANYCAST in 5G EC Environment

   Increasingly, Anycast is used by various application providers
   and CDNs because Anycast provides better and faster resiliency
   to failover events than GEO database DNS-based load balancing,
   which relies on DNS to provide a different IP based on source
   address.


Dunbar, et al.         Expires August 23, 2022           [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      AppMetaData for 5G EC Service

   Anycast address leverages the proximity information present in
   the network (routing) layer. It eliminates the single point of
   failure and bottleneck at the DNS resolvers. Anycast address
   can be assigned to multiple app layer load balancers to
   leverage network condition for balanced forwarding. Another
   benefit of using the ANYCAST address is removing the
   dependency on UEs. Some UEs (or clients) might use their
   cached IP addresses for an extended period instead of querying
   DNS.

   Client using Virtual IP address is a common practice in Cloud
   Native networking, e.g., Kubernetes, to scale dynamic changes
   of app servers' instantiations. Virtual IP requires the
   destination gateway node to perform address translation for
   return traffic, which is unsuitable for underlay network nodes
   with millions of flows passing by. The Cloud Native network
   can also leverage network condition to balance forwarding
   among multiple Cloud Gateway nodes by assigning the same
   virtual IP address (ANYCAST).

   Having multiple locations of the same IP address in the 5G EC
   LDN can be problematic if path selection is solely based on
   routing cost as the routing cost differences to reach
   different egress routers can be very small. This list
   elaborates the issues in detail:

     a) Path Selection: When a new flow comes to an ingress node
        (Ra), how to avoid instability with Anycast flipping
        between paths to the same address.  The problem also
        exists in the BGP multipath environment, with the optimal
        path selected based on routing cost metrics.

     b) Ingress node forwards the packets from one flow to the
        same ANYCAST server.

        a.k.a. Flow Affinity, or Flow-based load balancing.
        Almost all vendors have supported flow or session based
        ECMP load balancing and not per packet to avoid out of
        order packets                           for decades.  When a flow is hashed to an
        ECMP path, the flow remains on that path for the life of
        the flow until the flow ends.

        The ingress node, (Ra/Rb), can use Flow ID (in IPv6
        header) or UDP/TCP port number combined with the source
        address to enforce packets in one flow being placed in



Dunbar, et al.         Expires August 23, 2022           [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      AppMetaData for 5G EC Service

        one tunnel to one Egress router.  No new features are
        needed.

     c) When a UE moves to a new 5G site in the middle of a
        communication session with an EC server, a method is
        needed to stick the flow to the same EC server, which is
        required by 5G Edge Computing: 3GPP TR 23.748. [5g-edge-
        compute-sticky-service] describes several approaches to
        achieve stickiness in the IPv6 domain.

        Note: most EC services have shorter sessions, e.g.,
        shorter TCP sessions. Most likely, when a UE is moving to
        a new 5G site, the TCP session via the old UPF to an EC
        server is already finished. Only a very small percentage
        of registered EC services need to stick to the original
        server when handover to a new cell tower.

   From BGP perspective, the multiple servers with the same IP
   address (ANYCAST)attached to different egress routers is the
   same as multiple next hops for the IP address.

   This draft describes the BGP UPDATE to enable ingress routers
   to take the App Server load, the capacity index, and the
   location preference into consideration when computing the
   optimal path to the egress routers.



 1.4. Problem #2: Unbalanced Anycast Distribution due to UE
     Mobility

   Usually, higher capacity EC servers are placed in a metro data
   center to accommodate more UEs in the proximity needing the
   services, and fewer are placed in remote sites. When there is
   a special event occurring at a remote site for a short period,
   e.g., 1~2 days, the EC servers in the remote site might be
   heavily utilized. In contrast, the EC servers of the same app
   in the metro DC can be very underutilized. Since the condition
   can be short-lived, it might not make business sense to adjust
   EC capacity among DCs. Sometimes, UEs swarming to a specific
   site are not anticipated.

Internet-Draft      AppMetaData for 5G EC Service

  1.5. Problem 3: Application Server Relocation

   When an EC server is added to, moved, or deleted from a 5G EC
   Data Center, the routing protocol needs to propagate the
   changes to 5G PSA or the PSA adjacent routers.  After the
   change, the cost associated with the site might change as
   well.

   Note: for ease of description, the Edge Application Server and
   Application Server are used interchangeably throughout this
   document.

2. Conventions used in this document

   A-ER:       Egress Router to an Application Server, [A-ER] is
               used to describe the last router that the
               Application Server is attached. For a 5G EC
               environment, the A-ER can be the gateway router to
               a (mini) Edge Computing Data Center.

   Application Server: An application server is a physical or
               virtual server that hosts the software system for
               the application.

   Application Server Location: Represent a cluster of servers at
               one location serving the same Application. One
               application may have a Layer 7 Load balancer,
               whose address(es) are reachable from an external
               IP network, in front of a set of application
               servers. From an IP network perspective, this
               whole group of servers is considered as the
               Application server at the location.

3. Usage of AppMetaData for 5G Edge Computing

   AppMetaData consists of metrics about the running environment
   at the egress routers to which EC servers are directly
   attached.

  3.1. Assumptions

   From the IP Layer, the EC servers or their respective load
   balancers are identified by their IP addresses. Those IP
   addresses are the identifiers to the EC servers throughout
   this document. Here are some assumptions about the 5G EC
   services:
     - Only the registered EC services, which are only a small
        portion of the services, need to incorporate the
        destination capacity metrics for optimal forwarding.


Dunbar, et al.         Expires August 23, 2022           [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      AppMetaData for 5G EC Service

     - The 5G EC controller or management system can send those
        EC service identifiers to relevant routers.
     - The ingress routers' local BGP path compute algorithm
        includes a special plugin that can compute the path to
        the optimal Next Hop (egress router) based on the BGP
        AppMetaData TLV received for the registered EC services.

   The proposed solution is for the egress routers, a.k.a. A-ERs
   in this document, that have direct links to the EC Servers to
   collect various measurements about the Servers' running status
   [5G-EC-Metrics] and advertise the metrics to other routers in
   5G EC LDN (Local Data Network).

  3.2. IP Layer Metrics to Gauge Application Behavior

   [5G-EC-Metrics] describes the IP Layer Metrics that can gauge
   the application servers running status and environment:

   - IP-Layer Metric for App Server Load Measurement:
     The Load Measurement to an App Server is a weighted
     combination of the number of packets/bytes to the App Server
     and the number of packets/bytes from the App Server which
     are collected by the A-ER to which the App Server is
     directly attached.
     The A-ER is configured with an ACL that can filter out the
     packets for the Application Server.
   - Capacity Index
     a numeric number, configured on all A-ERs in the domain
     consistently, is used to represent the capacity of the
     application server attached to an A-ER. At some sites, the
     IP address exposed to the A-ER is the App Layer Load
     balancer that have many instances attached.  At other sites,
     the IP address exposed is the server instance itself.
   - Site preference index:
     is used to describe some sites are more preferred than
     others. For example, a site with higher bandwidth has a
     higher preference number than other.

   In this document, the term "Application Server Egress Router"
   [A-ER] is used to describe the last router that an Application
   Server is attached. For the 5G EC environment, the A-ER can be


Dunbar, et al.         Expires August 23, 2022          [Page 10]

Internet-Draft      AppMetaData for 5G EC Service

   the gateway router to the EC DC where multiple Application
   servers are hosted.


 3.3. AppMetaData Constrained Optimal Path Selection

   The main benefit of using ANYCAST is to leverage the network
   layer conditions to select an optimal path to the application
   instantiated in multiple locations.

   When the ingress routers to the 5G LDN are informed of the
   Load and Capacity Index of the App Servers at different EC
   data centers, they can incorporate those metrics with the
   network path conditions for path selection.

   Here is an algorithm that computes the cost to reach the App
   Servers attached to Site-i relative to another site, say Site-
   b. When the reference site, Site-b, is plugged in the formula,
   the cost is 1. So, if the formula returns a value less than 1,
   the cost to reach Site-i is less than reaching Site-b.

               CP-b * Load-i                Pref-b * Network-Delay-i
  Cost-i= (w *(----------------) + (1-w) *(-------------------------))
              CP-i * Load-b                Pref-i * Network-Delay-b


      Load-i: Load Index at Site-i, it is the weighted
      combination of the total packets or/and bytes sent to and
      received from the Application Server at Site-i during a
      fixed time period.

      CP-i: capacity index at Site-i, a higher value means higher
      capacity.

      Delay-i: Network latency measurement (RTT) to the A-ER that
      has the Application Server attached at the site-i.

      Pref-i: Preference index for the Site-i, a higher value
      means higher preference.

      w: Weight for load and site information, which is a value
      between 0 and 1. If smaller than 0.5, Network latency and
      the site Preference have more influence; otherwise, Server
      load and its capacity have more influence.

4. BGP Protocol Extension to advertise Load & Capacity

    The goal of the BGP extension is for egress routers to
    propagate the metrics about their running environment to
    ingress routers. Here are some examples of the metrics
    propagated by the egress routers:
    - the Load Measurement Index for the attached EC Servers,

    - the Capacity Index, and

    - Site Preference Index.

    This section specifies the Load Index Sub-TLV, Capacity Sub-
    TLV, and the Site Preference Sub-TLV that can be carried by
    the Tunnel Encap Path Attribute associated with the routes.

 4.1. Ingress Node BGP Path Selection Behavior

 4.1.1. AppMetaData Influenced BGP Path Selection

   When an ingress router receives BGP updates for the same IP
   address from multiple egress routers, all those egress routers
   are considered the next hops for the IP address. For the
   selected EC services, the ingress router's BGP engine would
   call a Plugin function that can select paths based on the
   AppMetaData received. The Plugin function is called Load
   Compute Engine throughout this document.

   Assume that both Ra and Rb in Figure-1 have BGP Multipath
   enabled. As a result, Dst Address: S1:aa08::4450 is resolved
   via multiple NextHop: R1, R2, R3.

   Suppose the local BGP's Load Compute Engine identifies R1 as
   the optimal NextHop for the flow towards S1:aa08::4450. Then
   the Load Compute Engine can insert a higher weight for the
   path R1 so that BGP Best Path is locally influenced by the
   weight parameter based on the local decision.

 4.1.2. Ingress Router Forwarding Behavior

   When the ingress router receives a packet and lookup the FIB,
   it gets the destination prefix's whole path. It encapsulates
   the packet destined towards the optimal egress node.

   For subsequent packets belonging to the same flow, the ingress
   router needs to forward them to the same egress router unless


Dunbar, et al.         Expires August 23, 2022          [Page 12]

Internet-Draft      AppMetaData for 5G EC Service

   the selected egress router is no longer reachable. Keeping
   packets from one flow to the same egress router, a.k.a. Flow
   Affinity, is supported by many commercial routers. Most
   registered EC services have relatively short flows.

   How Flow Affinity is implemented is out of the scope for this
   document. Here is one example to illustrate how Flow Affinity
   can be achieved. This illustration is not to be standardized.

     For the registered EC services, the ingress node keeps a
     table of
     -   Service ID (i.e., IP address)
     -   Flow-ID
     -   Sticky Egress ID (egress router loopback address)
     -   A timer

     The Flow-ID in this table is to identify a flow, initialized
     to NULL. How Flow-ID is constructed is out of the scope for
     this document. Here is one example of constructing the Flow-
     ID:
       - For IPv6, the Flow-ID can be the Flow-ID extracted from
          the IPv6 packet header with or without the source
          address.
       - For IPv4, the Flow-ID can be the combination of the
          Source Address with or without the TCP/UDP Port number.

     The Sticky Egress ID is the egress node address for the same
     flow. [5G-Sticky-Service] describes several methods to
     derive the Sticky Egress ID.

     The Timer is always refreshed when a packet with the
     matching EC Service ID (IP address) is received by the node.

     If there is no Stick Egress ID present in the table for the
     EC Service ID, the forwarding plane can select a NextHop
     influenced by the Load Compute Engine. The forwarding plane
     encapsulates the packet with a tunnel to the chosen
     NextHop. The chosen NextHop and the Flow ID are recorded in
     the EC Service table entry.

   When the selected optimal NextHop (egress router) is no longer
   reachable, refer to Section 6 Soft Anchoring on how another
   path is selected.

 4.1.3. Forwarding Behavior when UEs moving to new 5G Sites

   When a UE moves to a new 5G eNB which is anchored to the same
   UPF, the packets from the UE traverse to the same ingress
   router. Path selection and forwarding behavior are same as
   before.

   When the new eNB is anchored to a different UPF, the packets
   from the UE traverse a different ingress router. If the UE
   source IP address has been changed, indicating the new UPF
   might belong to a different administrative domain, the new
   ingress router treats the packets from the UE as a new flow
   and select the optimal path based on the configured policies.
   If the UE maintains the same IP address when anchored to a new
   UPF, the directly connected ingress router might use the pre-
   computed Egress Router, which is passed from a neighboring
   router. [5G-Edge-Sticky] describes methods for the ingress
   router connected to the UPF in the new site to consider the
   information passed from other ingress routers in selecting the
   optimal paths. The detailed algorithm is out of the scope of
   this document.

5. The Sub-TLVs for AppMetaData

   The AppMetaData attribute is encoded in an optional subTLV
   within the Tunnel Encap [RFC9012] Path Attribute.

   All values in the Sub-TLVs are unsigned 32 bits integers.

5.1. Load Measurement sub-TLV format

   Two types of Load Measurement Sub-TLVs are specified. One is
   to carry the aggregated cost Index based on a weighted
   combination of the collected measurements; another one is to
   carry the raw measurements of packets/bytes to/from the App
   Server address. The raw measurement is useful when ingress
   routers have embedded analytics relying on the raw
   measurements.

  5.2. Capacity Index sub-TLV format

   The Capacity Index sub-TLV has the following format:

   Note: "Capacity Index" can be more stable for each site. If
   those values are configured to nodes, they might not need to
   be included in every BGP UPDATE.



  5.3. The Site Preference Index sub-TLV format

   The site Preference Index is used to achieve Soft Anchoring
   [Section 5] an application flow from a UE to a specific
   location when the UE moves from one 5G site to another.

   The Preference Index sub-TLV has the following format:

Internet-Draft      AppMetaData for 5G EC Service

6. AppMetaData Propagation Scope

   AppMetaData is only to be distributed to the relevant ingress
   nodes of the 5G EC local data networks. Only the ingress
   routers that are configured with the 5G EC services need to
   receive the AppMetaData for specific Service IDs.

   For each registered EC service, a corresponding filter group
   can be formed on RR to represent the interested ingress
   routers that are interested in receiving the corresponding
   AppMetaData information.

7. Minimum Interval for Metrics Change Advertisement

   As the metrics change can impact the path selection, the
   Minimum Interval for Metrics Change Advertisement is
   configured to control the update frequency to avoid route
   oscillations. Default is 30s.

   Significant load changes at EC data centers can be triggered
   by short-term gatherings of UEs, like conventions, lasting a
   few hours or days, which are too short to justify adjusting EC
   server capacities among DCs. Therefore, the load metrics
   change rate can be in the magnitude of hours or days.

8. Soft Anchoring of an ANYCAST Flow
   "Sticky Service" in the 3GPP Edge Computing specification
   (3GPP TR 23.748) is about flows from a UE sticking to a
   specific location when the UE moves from one 5G Site to
   another.

   "Soft Anchoring" is a mechanism for ingress routers to apply
   preference to the path towards the previous server location
   when the UE is anchored to a new UPF and continue using its
   cached IP for the EC server.

   Let's assume one application "App.net" is instantiated on
   four servers that are attached to four different routers R1,
   R2, R3, and R4 respectively. It is desired for packets to the
   "App.net" from UE-1 to stick with one server, say the App
   Server attached to R1, even when the UE moves from one 5G
   site to another. However, when there is a failure reaching R1
   or the Application Server attached to R1, the packets of the
   flow "App.net" from UE-1 need to be forwarded to the
   Application Server attached to R2, R3, or R4.



Dunbar, et al.         Expires August 23, 2022          [Page 17]

Internet-Draft      AppMetaData for 5G EC Service

   We call this kind of sticky service "Soft Anchoring", meaning
   that anchoring to the site of R1 is preferred, but other
   sites can be chosen when the preferred site encounters a
   failure.

   Here is a mechanism to achieve Soft Anchoring:

      - Assign a group of ANYCAST addresses to one application.
        For example, "App.net" is assigned with 4 ANYCAST
        addresses, L1, L2, L3, and L4. L1/L2/L3/L4 represents
        the location preferred ANYCAST addresses.
      - For the App.net Server attached to a router, the router
        has four Stub links to the same Server, L1, L2, L3, and
        L4 respectively. The cost to L1, L2, L3, and L4 is
        assigned differently for different egress routers. For
        example,
           o When attached to R1, the L1 has the lowest cost,
             say 10, when attached to R2, R3, and R4, the L1 can
             have a higher cost, say 30.
           o ANYCAST L2 has the lowest cost when attached to R2,
             higher cost when attached to R1, R3, R4
             respectively.
           o ANYCAST L3 has the lowest cost when attached to R3,
             higher cost when attached to R1, R2, R4
             respectively, and
           o ANYCAST L4 has the lowest cost when attached to R4,
             higher cost when attached to R1, R2, R3
             respectively
      - When a UE queries for the "App.net" for the first time,
        the DNS reply has the location preferred ANYCAST
        address, say L1, based on where the query is initiated.
      - When the UE moves from one 5G site-A to Site-B, UE
        continues sending packets of the "App.net" to ANYCAST
        address L1. The routers will continue sending packets to
        R1 because the total cost for the App.net instance for
        ANYCAST L1 is lowest at R1. If any failure occurs making
        R1 not reachable, the packets of the "App.net" from UE-1
        will be sent to R2, R3, or R4 (depending on the total
        cost to reach L1 attached to R2/R3/R4).



Dunbar, et al.         Expires August 23, 2022          [Page 18]

Internet-Draft      AppMetaData for 5G EC Service



   If the Application Server supports the HTTP redirect, more
   optimal forwarding can be achieved.

      - When a UE queries for the "App.net" for the first time,
        the global DNS reply has the ANYCAST address G1, which
        has the same cost regardless of where the Application
        servers are attached.
      - When the UE initiates the communication to G1, the
        packets from the UE will be sent to the Application
        Server that has the lowest cost, say the Server attached
        to R1. The Application server is instructed with HTTPs
        Redirect to reply with a location-specific URL, say
        App.net-Loc1. The client on the UE will query the DNS
        for App.net-Loc1 and get the response of ANYCAST L1. The
        subsequent packets from the UE-1 for App.net are sent to
        L1.
