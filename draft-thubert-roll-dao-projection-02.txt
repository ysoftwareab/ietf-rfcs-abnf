1.  Introduction

   The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks [RFC6550]
   (LLN)(RPL) specification defines a generic Distance Vector protocol
   that is designed for very low energy consumption and adapted to a
   variety of LLNs.  RPL forms Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic
   Graphs (DODAGs) which root often acts as the Border Router to connect
   the RPL domain to the Internet.  The root is responsible to select
   the RPL Instance that is used to forward a packet coming from the
   Internet into the RPL domain and set the related RPL information in
   the packets.

   The non-storing mode of operation (MOP) is largely utilized because
   networks can get very large and the amount of memory in nodes close
   to the root may become prohibitive in storing mode.

   But as a network gets deep, the size of the source routing header
   that the root must add to all the downward packets may also become an
   issue as well.  In some cases, RPL network form long lines and a
   limited number of well-targeted routes would enable a loose source
   routing operation and save packet size, energy, and eventually
   fragmentation which is highly detrimental to the LLN operation.
   Because the capability to store state in every node is limited, the
   decision of which route is installed where can only be optimized with
   a global knowledge of the system.

   RPL storing mode is optimized or Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP), root to
   leaves and Multipoint-to-Point (MP2P) leaves to root operations.
   Peer to Peer (P2P) routes in a RPL network will generally suffer from
   some stretch since routing between 2 peers always happens via a
   common parent.

Internet-Draft     Root initiated routing state in RPL     November 2015


   The 6TiSCH architecture [I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture] leverages the
   Deterministic Networking Architecture [I-D.finn-detnet-architecture]
   as one possible model whereby the device resources and capabilities
   are exposed to an external controller which installs routing states
   into the network based on some objective functions that reside in
   that external entity.

   Based on heuristics of usage, path length, and knowledge of device
   capacity and available resources such as battery levels and
   reservable buffers, a Path Computation Element ([PCE]) with a global
   visibility on the system could install additional P2P routes that are
   more optimized for the current needs as expressed by the objective
   function.

   This draft enables a RPL root, with optionally the assistance of a
   PCE, to install and maintain additional storing mode routes within
   the RPL domain, along a selected set of nodes and for a selected
   duration, thus providing routes from suitable than those obtained
   from the distributed operation of RPL in either storing and non-
   storing modes.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The Terminology used in this document is consistent with and
   incorporates that described in `Terminology in Low power And Lossy
   Networks' [RFC7102] and [RFC6550].

3.  New RPL Control Message Options

   Section 6.7 of [RFC6550] specifies Control Message Options (CMO) to
   be placed in RPL messages such as the DAO message.  The RPL Target
   Option and the Transit Information Option (TIO) are such options; the
   former indicates a node to be reached and the latter specifies a
   parent that can be used to reach that node.  Options may be
   factorized; one or more contiguous TIOs apply to the one or more
   contiguous Target options that immediately precede the TIOs in the
   RPL message.

   This specification introduces a new Control Message Option, the Via
   Information option (VIO).  Like the TIO, the VIO MUST be preceded by
   one or more RPL Target options to which it applies.  Unlike the TIO,
   the VIO are not factorized: multiple contiguous Via options indicate
   an ordered sequence of hops to reach the target(s), presented in the
   same order as they would appear in a routing header.

3.1.  Via Information

   The Via Information option MAY be present in DAO messages, and its
   format is as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3

                    Figure 1: Eliding the RPLInstanceID

   Option Type:  0x0A (to be confirmed by IANA)

   Option Length:  Variable, depending on whether or not Parent Address
         is present.

   Path Sequence:  8-bit unsigned integer.  When a RPL Target option is
         issued by the root of the DODAG (i.e. in a DAO message), that
         root sets the Path Sequence and increments the Path Sequence
         each time it issues a RPL Target option with updated
         information.  The indicated sequence deprecates any state for a
         given Target that was learned from a previous sequence and adds
         to any state that was learned for that sequence.

   Path Lifetime:  8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of time in
         Lifetime Units (obtained from the Configuration option) that
         the prefix is valid for route determination.  The period starts
         when a new Path Sequence is seen.  A value of all one bits
         (0xFF) represents infinity.  A value of all zero bits (0x00)
         indicates a loss of reachability.  A DAO message that contains
         a Via Information option with a Path Lifetime of 0x00 for a
         Target is referred as a No-Path (for that Target) in this
         document.

   Next-Hop Address:  8 or 16 bytes.  IPv6 Address of the next hop
         towards the destination(s) indicated in the target option that
         immediately precede the VIO.  The /64 prefix can be elided if

         it is the same as that of (all of) the target(s).  In that
         case, the Next-Hop Address is expressed as the 8-bytes suffix
         only, otherwise it is expressed as 16 bytes.

4.  Loose Source Routing in Non-storing Mode

   A classical RPL implementation in a very constrained LLN uses the
   non-storing mode of operation whereby a RPL node indicates a parent-
   child relationship to the root, using a Destination Advertisement
   Object (DAO) that is unicast from the node directly to the root, and
   the root builds a path to a destination down the DODAG by
   concatenating this information.

   Nodes are not expected to store downward routing state via their
   children, and the routing operates in strict source routing mode as
   detailed in An IPv6 Routing Header for Source Routes with RPL
   [RFC6554]

   This draft proposes an addition whereby the root projects a route
   through an extended DAO to an arbitrary node down the DODAG,
   indicating a child or a direct sequence of children via which a
   certain destination (target) may be reached.  The root is expected to
   use the mechanism optimally and with required parsimony to fit within
   the device resources, but how the root figures the amount of
   resources that are available is out of scope.

                Figure 2: Non-Storing with Projected routes

   When a RPL domain operates in non-storing Mode of Operation (NS-MOP),
   only the root possesses routing information about the whole network.
   A packet that is generated within the domain first reaches the root,
   which can then apply a source routing information to reach the
   destination.  Similarly, a packet coming from the outside of the
   domain for a destination that is expected to be in a RPL domain
   reaches the root.

   In NS-MOP, the root, or some associated centralized computation
   engine, can thus determine the amount of packets that reach a
   destination in the RPL domain, and thus the amount of energy and
   bandwidth that is wasted for transmission, between itself and the
   destination, as well as the risk of fragmentation, any potential
   delays because of a paths longer than necessary (shorter paths exist
   that would not traverse the root).

   Additionally, the DAG root knows the whole DAG topology, so when the
   source of a packet is also in the RPL domain, the root can determine
   the common parent that would have been used in storing mode, and thus
   the list of nodes in the path between the common parent and the
   destination.  For instance in the below diagram, if the source is 41
   and the destination 52, the common parent is the node 22.

                Figure 3: Non-Storing with Projected routes

   With this draft, the root can install routing states along a segment
   that is either itself to the destination, or from one or more common
   parents for a particular source/destination pair towards that
   destination (in our example, this would be the segment made of nodes
   22, 32, 42).

   The draft expects that the root has enough information about the
   capability for each node to store a number of routes, which can be
   discovered for instance using a Network Management System (NMS) and/
   or the RPL routing extensions specified in Routing for Path
   Calculation in LLNs [RFC6551].  Based on that information, the root
   computes which segment should be routed and which relevant state
   should be installed in which nodes.  The algorithm is out of scope
   but it is envisaged that the root could compute the ratio between the
   optimal path (existing path not traversing the root, and the current
   path), the application SLA for specific flows that could benefit from
   shorter paths, the energy wasted in the network, local congestion on
   various links that would benefit from having flows routed along other
   paths.

   This draft introduces a new mode of operation for loose source
   routing in the LLN, the Non-Storing with Projected routes MOP.  With
   this new MOP, the root sends a unicast DAO message to the last node
   of the routing segment that must be installed.  The DAO message
   contains the ordered list of hops along the segment as a list of Via
   Information options that are preceded by one or more RPL Target



Thubert & Pylakutty        Expires May 5, 2016                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     Root initiated routing state in RPL     November 2015


   options to which they relate.  Each Via Information option contains a
   lifetime for which state is to be maintained.

   The root sends the DAO directly to the last node in the segment,
   which is expected to be able to route to the targets on its own.

   The last node in the segment may have another information to reach
   the target(s), such as a connected route or an already installed
   projected route.  If it does not have such a route then the node
   should lookup the address on the relevant interfaces.  If one of the
   targets cannot be located, the node MUST answer to the root with a
   negative DAO-ACK listing the target(s) that could not be located
   (suggested status 10), and continue the process for those targets
   that could be located if any.

   For the targets that could be located, last node in the segment
   generates a DAO to its loose predecessor in the segment as indicated
   in the list of Via Information options.

   The node strips the last Via Information option which corresponds to
   self, and uses it as source address for the DAO to the predecessor.
   The address of the predecessor to be used as destination for the DAO
   message is found in the now last Via Information option.  The
   predecessor is expected to have a route to the address used as
   source, either connected, installed previously as another DAO, or
   from other means.

   The predecessor is expected to have a route to the address used as
   source and that is his successor.  If it does not and cannot locate
   the successor, the predecessor node MUST answer to the root with a
   negative DAO-ACK indicating the successor that could not be located.
   The DAO-ACK contains the list of targets that could not be routed to
   (suggested status 11).

   If the predecessor can route to the successor node, then it installs
   a route to the targets via the successor.  If that route is not
   connected then a recursive lookup will take place to reach the
   target(s).  From there, the node strips the last Via Information
   option and either answers to the root with a positive DAO-ACK that
   contains the list of targets that could be routed to, or propagates
   the DAO to its own predecessor.

   A NULL lifetime in the Via Information option along the segment is
   used to clean up the state.

   In the example below, say that there is a lot of traffic to nodes 55
   and 56 and the root decides to reduce the size of routing headers to
   those destinations.  The root can first send a DAO to node 45

   indicating target 55 and a Via segment (35, 45), as well as another
   DAO to node 46 indicating target 56 and a Via segment (35, 46).  This
   will save one entry in the routing header on both sides.  The root
   may then send a DAO to node 35 indicating targets 55 and 56 a Via
   segment (13, 24, 35) to fully optimize that path.

   Alternatively, the root may send a DAO to node 45 indicating target
   55 and a Via segment (13, 24, 35, 45) and then a DAO to node 46
   indicating target 56 and a Via segment (13, 24, 35, 46), indicating
   the same DAO Sequence.

5.  Centralized Computation of Optimized Peer-to-Peer Routes

   With the initial specifications of RPL [RFC6550], the P2P path from a
   source to a destination is often stretched, as illustrated in
   [RFC6550]:

      - in non-storing mode, all packets routed within the DODAG flow
      all the way up to the root of the DODAG.  If the destination is in
      the same DODAG, the root must encapsulate the packet to place a
      Routing Header that has the strict source route information down
      the DODAG to the destination.  This will be the case even if the
      destination is relatively close to the source and the root is
      relatively far off.

      - in storing mode, unless the destination is a child of the
      source, the packets will follow the default route up the DODAG as
      well.  If the destination is in the same DODAG, they will
      eventually reach a common parent that has a DAO route to the
      destination; at worse, the common parent may also be the root.
      From that common parent, the packet will follow a path down the
      DODAG that is optimized for the Objective Function that was used
      to build the DODAG.

   It results that it is often beneficial to enable additional P2P
   routes, either if the RPL route present a stretch from shortest path,
   or if the new route is engineered with a different objective.

                         Figure 4: Routing Stretch

   For that reason, earlier work at the IETF introduced the Reactive
   Discovery of Point-to-Point Routes in Low Power and Lossy Networks
   [RFC6997], which specifies a distributed method for establishing
   optimized P2P routes.  This draft proposes an alternate based on a
   centralized route computation.

   It must be noted that RPL has a concept of instance but does not have
   a concept of an administrative distance, which exists in certain
   proprietary implementations to sort out conflicts between multiple
   sources.  This draft conforms the instance model as follows:

      - if the PCE needs to influence a particular instance to add
      better routes in conformance with the routing objectives in that
      instance, it may do so.  When the PCE modifies an existing
      instance then the added routes must not create a loop in that
      instance.  This is achieved by always preferring a route obtained
      from the PCE over a route that is learned via RPL.

      - If the PCE installs a more specific (Traffic Engineering) route
      between a particular pair of nodes then it should use a Local
      Instance from the ingress node of that path.  Only packets
      associated with that instance will be routed along that path.

   In all cases, the path is indicated by VIA options, and the flow is
   similar to the flow used to obtain loose source routing.

   The root sends the DAO with the target option and the Via Option to
   the lest router in the path; the last router removes the last Via
   Option and passes the DAO to the previous hop.

6.  Security Considerations

   This draft uses messages that are already present in [RFC6550] with
   optional secured versions.  The same secured versions may be used
   with this draft, and whatever security is deployed for a given
   network also applies to the flows in this draft.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA registry for the Mode of Operation
   (MOP)

      4: Non-Storing with Projected routes [this]

   This document updates IANA registry for the RPL Control Message
   Options
