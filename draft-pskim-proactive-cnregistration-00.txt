Abstract

   In this document, a proactive correspondent registration mechanism 
   is proposed for the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) route optimization 
   between the correspondent node (CN) and the mobile access gateway 
   (MAG) on behalf of the mobile node (MN). Two scenarios are 
   considered according to the type of CN. For the proposed mechanism, 
   the proxy home test and the concurrent care-of test are defined 
   newly with parameters specified by information on candidate MAGs. 
   The proposed correspondent registration mechanism is performed 
   before actual handover for candidate MAGs where the MN can attach
   newly. Therefore, the proposed mechanism can reduce correspondent 
   registration latency, which can reduce handover latency and thus 
   enhance throughput degradation caused by the bidirectional tunneling
   via the local mobility anchor (LMA).

1.  Introduction

   In recent, to support IP mobility for all hosts irrespective of the 
   presence or absence of Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) functionality in [1], the
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is being standardized in Internet 
   Engineer Task Force (IETF) [2]-[4]. This protocol to supporting 
   mobility does not require the mobile node (MN) to be involved in the 
   signaling required for mobility management. The mobility access 
   gateway (MAG) in the network performs the signaling and does the 
   mobility management on behalf of the MN. The PMIPv6 can be the L3 
   handover solution for wireless access networks from now on.

   For the successful deployment of PMIPv6, the need to communicate 
   efficiently on the move and to minimize the packet loss caused by a 
   handover is becoming increasingly important because handover latency
   is unacceptable for real-time IP services. The L3 handover latency 
   in PMIPv6 can be caused mainly by the network access authentication 
   latency and the correspondent registration latency for the route 
   optimization, etc. These latencies are inevitable in PMIPv6 because 
   of its basic operations. These latencies could be appreciable for 
   real-time applications and throughput sensitive applications. Among 
   them, in this paper, the correspondent registration latency for the 
   route optimization will be considered and reduced by the proposed 
   mechanism.

   The PMIPv6 protocol specification [2] doesn't provide any route 
   optimization. Therefore, when the MN moves and attaches to a new 
   link connected to the new MAG in the PMIPv6 domain, the 
   bidirectional tunneling between the CN and the MAG on behalf of the 
   MN via the local mobility agent (LMA) cannot be avoided before the 
   correspondent registration procedure is completed between two 
   entities. This bidirectional tunneling via the LMA may not allow 
   the shortest communication path to be used. That is, data packets 
   between two entities are often routed along paths that are 
   significantly longer than optimal, which can cause end-to-end delay 
   between two entities. In addition, this can also cause congestion 
   at the LMA and its link. Moreover, the impact of any possible 
   failure of the LMA or networks on the path to or from it can 
   increase. Therefore, two entities suffer from significant throughput 
   degradation caused by the bidirectional tunneling for interactive 
   and real-time applications. As shown in [5], TCP bulk-data transfers
   are likewise affected since long handoff latencies may lead to 
   successive retransmission timeouts and degraded throughput. That 
   is, the correspondent registration procedure using cryptographic 
   functions can help secure the PMIPv6 communication between two 
   entities, but it also introduces significant quality of service 
   (QoS) issues such as delay, congestion, etc. This means there is a 
   tradeoff between security and QoS.

   In order to solve the mentioned problem in the route optimization 
   procedure, the correspondent registration between the CN and the MAG 
   on behalf of the MN should be completed within short time as 
   possible to reduce the correspondent registration latency. However, 
   as shown in [3], the proxy home test and the concurrent proxy 
   care-of test including the proxy binding update (PBU) and the proxy 
   binding acknowledgement (PBA) for the correspondent registration are 
   somewhat time-consuming and computationally burdensome since 
   cryptographic functions for authentication and encryption require 
   considerable computation and CPU processing time, which might 
   introduces the binding latency.       

   In this document, therefore, a proactive correspondent registration 
   mechanism between the CN and the MAG on behalf of the MN is proposed 
   in order to reduce correspondent registration latency for the PMIPv6 
   route optimization. As shown in [3], two scenarios are considered 
   according to the type of CN. The first scenario is that the CN has 
   the MIPv6 function and recognize PMIPv6 messages. The second 
   scenario is that the CN doesn't have MIPv6 function and are 
   provided mobility support by PMIPv6. The proxy home test and the 
   concurrent care-of test including the PBU and the PBA are defined 
   newly with parameters specified by information on candidate MAGs. 
   The correspondent registration through above messages is performed 
   before actual handover for candidate MAGs where the MN can attach 
   newly. Therefore, the proposed mechanism can reduce correspondent 
   registration latency, which can reduce handover latency and thus 
   enhance throughput degradation caused by the bidirectional 
   tunneling via the LMA.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Network Scenarios

   This document considers the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) based IEEE 
   802.16 wireless network which consists of only several mobile access 
   gateways (MAGs) that typically run on corresponding access routers, 
   as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. This network configuration might 
   be feasible because there are often access networks that several 
   access routers can cover quite a wide area. For example, in 
   broadband wireless access (BWA) networks such as IEEE 802.16e 
   wireless network [6], several access routers can cover quite a wide 
   area where the MN can move.   

   In this document, it is assumed that all MAGs can share information 
   on other MAGs which exist in same PMIPv6 domain. As shown in

Internet-Draft    Proactive Correspondent Registration     November 2007

   Table 1, for all MAGs, the information consists of the MAG 
   identifier (MID), the network prefix for proxy care-of address 
   (Proxy-CoA) configuration, the list of candidate MAGs where the MN 
   can attach newly. The MAG can acquire this information from the 
   policy store. As shown in [3], there are two scenarios according 
   to the type of CN. The first scenario is that CNs have MIPv6 
   function and recognize PMIPv6 messages as shown in Figure 1. The 
   second scenario is that CNs don't have MIPv6 function and are 
   provided mobility support by PMIPv6 as shown in Figure 2. Note that 
   this document borrows all of the terminology from the IETF 
   specification [1]-[4] and the IEEE 802.16e specification [6].

4.  Proactive Correspondent Registration Mechanism
 
4.1  Tradeoff between Security and QoS in PMIPv6 Handover Procedure

   The PMIPv6 protocol specification [2] doesn't provide any route 
   optimization. Therefore, when the MN moves and attaches to a new 
   link connected to the new MAG in the PMIPv6 domain, the 
   bidirectional tunneling between the CN and the MAG on behalf of the 
   MN via the LMA cannot be avoided before the correspondent 
   registration procedure is completed between two entities. This 
   bidirectional tunneling via the LMA may not allow the shortest 
   communication path to be used. That is, data packets between two 
   entities are often routed along paths that are significantly longer 
   than optimal, which can cause end-to-end delay between two entities. 
   For example, a VoIP application is much more sensitive to delays 
   than its traditional data counterparts. A few seconds' slowdown is 
   negligible for downloading a file. However, a mere 150 millisecond 
   delay can turn a crisp VoIP call into a garbled, unintelligent mess. 
   In addition, this can also cause congestion at the LMA and its link. 
   Moreover, the impact of any possible failure of the LMA or networks 
   on the path to or from it can increase. Therefore, two entities 
   suffer from significant throughput degradation caused by the 
   bidirectional tunneling for interactive and real-time applications. 
   As shown in [5], TCP bulk-data transfers are likewise affected since 
   long handoff latencies may lead to successive retransmission 
   timeouts and degraded throughput. That is, the binding procedure 
   using cryptographic functions can help secure the PMIPv6 
   communication between two entities, but it also introduces 
   significant QoS issues such as delay, congestion, etc. This means 
   there is a tradeoff between security and QoS.
   
   In order to solve the mentioned problem in the route optimization 
   procedure, the correspondent registration between the CN and the MAG

   on behalf of the MN should be also completed within short time as 
   possible to reduce the correspondent registration latency. However, 
   as shown in [3], the proxy home test and the concurrent proxy 
   care-of test including the early PBU and the PBA for the 
   correspondent registration are somewhat time-consuming and 
   computationally burdensome since cryptographic functions for 
   authentication and encryption require considerable computation and 
   CPU processing time, which might introduces the binding latency.

4.2  New Proxy Home Test and Concurrent Care-of Test Procedures

   In this section, the proxy home test and the concurrent proxy 
   care-of test for the correspondent registration are newly defined 
   with parameters specified by information on candidate MAGs. 
   
   For simplicity, hereafter, the MAG on behalf of the MN and the MAG 
   on behalf of the CN are called the MAG_MN and the MAG_CN, 
   respectively. The LMA for the MN and the LMA for the CN are called 
   the LMA_MN and the LMA_CN. 

4.3  Processing Cryptographic Functions for New Return Routability 
     Procedure
   
   (1) New Proxy Home Test Procedure

   As soon as the MAG_MN makes decision on which the CN or the MAG_CN 
   needs the route optimization, the MAG_MN initiates the proxy home 
   test procedure. The CN or the MAG_CN verifies the reachability of 
   MN's home address (MN-HoA) via this procedure. For the new proxy 
   home test, two messages are defined with parameters specified by 
   information on candidate MAGs where the MN can attach newly.

   - Proxy Home Test Init (PHoTI) 
 
   The MAG_MN sends the PHoTI message to acquire home keygen tokens for 
   candidate MAGs. In this message, the field of parameters can be 
   defined by MIDs, proxy care-of addresses (Proxy-CoAs), home init 
   cookies, which are generated by the MAG_MN for candidate MAGs. 

   In case of the 1st scenario of Figure 1, the PHoTI message is sent 
   to the CN via the shared tunnel between the MAG_MN and the LMA_MN. 
   On the other hand, in case of the 2nd scenario of Figure 2, the 
   PHoTI message is sent to the MAG_CN via the shared tunnel between 
   the MAG_MN and the LMA_MN. Then, this PHoTI message is forwarded to 
   proxy home address of the CN by the LMA_MN. At the LMA_CN, this 
   message is tunnelled into the shared tunnel between the LMA_CN and 
   the MAG_CN. Then, the MAG_CN intercepts the PHoTI message and 
   extracts MN-HoA and Proxy-CoAs for candidate MAGs from it. 

   - Proxy Home Test (PHoT)

Internet-Draft    Proactive Correspondent Registration     November 2007

   The PHoT message is sent in response to a PHoTI message. In this 
   message, the field of parameters can be defined by MIDs, home keygen 
   tokens, home init cookies, home nonce indices, which are generated 
   by the CN or the MAG_CN for candidate MAGs. Home init cookies from 
   the MAG_MN are returned in the PHoT message, to ensure that the 
   message comes from a node on the route between the LMA_MN and the 
   CN or between the LMA_MN and the MAG_CN. Home nonce indices are 
   delivered to the MAG_MN to later allow the CN or the MAG_CN to 
   efficiently find the nonce value that it used in creating home 
   keygen tokens. Home keygen tokens for corresponding candidate MAGs 
   are computed by processing cryptographic functions in [6].

   In case of the 1st scenario of Figure 1, the CN sends the PHoT 
   message back to the MAG_MN via the shared tunnel between the MAG_MN 
   and the LMA_MN. On the other hand, in case of the 2nd scenario of 
   Figure 2, the MAG_CN sends the PHoT message back to the MAG_MN and 
   adds Proxy-CoA of the CN into PHoT message. The MAG_CN creates a 
   binding cache entry for this MN. This PHoT is sent via the shared 
   tunnel between MAG_CN and the LMA_CN. Then, the LMA_CN forwards this 
   message to the MN-CoA  which tunnels it to the MAG_MN. The MAG_MN 
   receives PHoT message, it extracts the Proxy-CoA of CN and adds this 
   information to the binding cache entry for CN. 

   (2) New Concurrent Proxy Care-of Test Procedure

   The CN or the MAG_CN also needs to prove the reachability of the 
   Proxy-CoA, which is called the proxy care-of test. This 
   proxy care-of test is piggybacked on a Proxy Binding Update (PBU)
   which is sent by the MAG_MN to register with the CN or the MAG_CN. 
   That is, the proxy care-of test is done concurrently with the early 
   PBU exchange, so it is called the concurrent proxy care-of test.   

   - Proxy Care-of Test Init (PCoTI) 

   The MAG_MN sends the early PBU which contains the PCoTI option to 
   acquire the care-of keygen token for candidate MAGs. In the PCoTI 
   option, the field of parameters can be defined by MIDs, 
   Proxy-CoAs, care-of init cookies, which are generated by the MAG_MN 
   for candidate MAGs.

   In case of the 1st scenario of Figure 1, it is sent directly to the 
   CN. On the other hand, in case of the 2nd scenario in Figure 2, it 
   is sent directly to the Proxy-CoA of CN, i.e. to the MAG_CN. The 
   field of parameters in the early PBU can be defined as [1] for 
   candidate MAGs.

   sent in response to the early PBU message with PCoTI option. In the 
   PCoT option, the field of parameters can be defined by MIDs, 
   care-of init cookies, care-of keygen tokens, care-of nonce indices 
   for candidate MAGs, which are generated by the CN or the MAG_CN. 
   Care-of nonce indices are provided to identify the nonce used for 
   care-of keygen tokens. Home and care-of nonce indices may be the 
   same, or different, in PHoT message and PCoT option. Care-of keygen 
   tokens for corresponding candidate MAGs are computed by processing 
   cryptographic functions in [6].
    
   This message is sent directly to the MAG_MN for both scenarios. In 
   the PBA message, the field of parameters can be defined as [1] for 
   candidate MAGs.


5.  Operation Procedure and Advantages over Existing Mechanism

   To describe the operation procedure of the proposed proactive 
   correspondent registration mechanism, it will be assumed that the 
   MN moves and attaches to the 'MAG_C' from the 'MAG_A' and then 
   moves and attaches to the 'MAG_E'. The existing mechanism was 
   explained in [2][3].

   For the proposed proactive correspondent registration mechanism, 
   when the MN moves and attaches to 'MAG_A', the 'MAG_A' on behalf 
   of the MN performs the newly defined correspondent registration for 
   candidate MAGs 'MAG_C' and 'MAG_E' at appropriate time using MAG 
   information cached beforehand, such as the MID, the network prefix 
   for Proxy-CoA configuration, the list of candidate MAGs where the 
   MN can attach newly as shown in Table 1. In real-time communication, 
   when the MAG_A performs actual PMIPv6 handover to 'MAG_C', the 
   'trigger' may arrive from specific L2 events that might determine 
   the need for handover. In this document, this trigger itself is not 
   specified in detail. After the network access authentication, the 
   direct communication between CN and 'MAG_C' or between MAG_CN and 
   'MAG_C' can be started without the correspondent registration on 
   'MAG_C'. Therefore, the correspondent registration latency between 
   two entities can be reduced because somewhat time-consuming and 
   computationally burdensome tasks are performed beforehand. That is, 
   the proposed proactive correspondent registration mechanism can 
   reduce handover latency and thus enhance throughput degradation 
   caused by the bidirectional tunneling. On the other hand, in the 
   existing mechanism [2][3], these time-consuming and computationally 
   burdensome tasks for correspondent registration are performed during 
   the PMIPv6 handover procedure. In addition, the proposed mechanism 
   can also avoid congestion at the LMA and its link during PMIPv6 
   handover. Moreover, the impact of any possible failure of the LMA or 
   networks on the path to or from it can decrease.
