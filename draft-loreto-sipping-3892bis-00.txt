Abstract

   SIP has a mechanism for conveying the asserted identity of the
   originator of a request by means of the P-Asserted-Identity header
   field.  When exploding a SIP MESSAGE request to a pre-defined group
   URI and when exploding a SIP INVITE request to an ad-hoc group or to
   a pre-defined group URI, the Referred-By header field in the
   resulting exploded requests is set to the P-Asserted-Identity header
   field or to the From header field.  The Referred-By header is only
   included if the P-Asserted-Identity header field or From header field
   needs to carry another value, e.g. the URI of a pre-defined group, or
   a conference focus URI.  Since the P-Asserted-Identity header field

   may carry up to two values, the Referred-By definition needs to be
   extended to allow up to two values as well.

Internet-Draft      Updates to Referred-By SIP header           Jul 2008


1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and indicate requirement
   levels for compliant implementations.


2.  Introduction

   SIP has a mechanism for conveying the asserted identity of the
   originator of a request by means of the P-Asserted-Identity header
   field.

   When exploding a SIP MESSAGE request to a pre-defined group URI and
   when exploding a SIP INVITE request to an ad-hoc group using
   [I-D.ietf-sip-uri-list-conferencing] or to a pre-defined group URI
   for SIP, the Referred-By header field in the resulting exploded
   requests is set to P-Asserted-Identity header field or From header
   field.  The Referred-By header is only included if the P-Asserted-
   Identity header field or From header fields need to carry another
   value, e.g. the URI of a pre-defined group, or a conference focus
   URI.

   Since the P-Asserted-Identity header field may carry up to two values
   as specified in [RFC3325], the Referred-By definition in [RFC3892]
   needs to be extended to allow up to two values as well.

   This document extends [RFC3892] by allowing all values of the
   P-Asserted-Identity header field to be carried in the Referred-By
   header field.


3.  Inclusion of up to two URIs in a Referred-By header

   [RFC3892] does not allow more than one URI in the Referred-By header.
   However, if the contents of the Referred-By header come from a
   P-Asserted-Identity header field, then all of the URIs present in the
   P-Asserted-Identity header field should be copied into the
   Referred-By header field.


4.  Behaviour

   This updates [RFC3892] by allowing a Referred-By header to contain up
   to two URIs as defined for P-Asserted-Identity header field in
   [RFC3325].

4.1.  Referrer Behaviour

   A server generating a SIP Request because of exploder functionality
   for SIP MESSAGE sent to a pre-defined group URI or for SIP INVITE
   sent to an ad-hoc group as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-sip-uri-list-conferencing] or to a pre-defined group URI,
   MAY include up to two URIs in a Referred-By header field in a request
   to report the identity of the user on behalf of which the server is
   acting and whose identity the server is in a position to assert.  A
   server SHOULD do so only in cases where it can expect to be trusted
   by the first proxy.

   If Privacy was requested then there will only be one URI in the
   Referred-By header containing an anonymous URI.


5.  Referrer Behaviour

   The BNF in [RFC3892] is augmented from this:

         Referred-By  =  ("Referred-By" / "b") HCOLON referrer-uri
                        *( SEMI (referredby-id-param / generic-param) )
         referrer-uri = ( name-addr / addr-spec )

   to this:

         Referred-By = ("Referred-By" / "b") HCOLON referrer-uri
                         *(COMMA referrer-uri)
                         *( SEMI (referredby-id-param / generic-param) )
         referrer-uri = ( name-addr / addr-spec )

   A Referred-By header field value MUST consist of exactly one name-
   addr or addr-spec.  There may be one or two Referred-By values.  If
   there is one value, it MUST be a sip, sips, or tel URI.If there are
   two values, one value MUST be a sip or sips URI and the other MUST be
   a tel URI.


6.  IANA Considerations


7.  Security considerations

   The use of the Referred-By header raises a number of security
   considerations, which are discussed fully in [RFC3892].  This
   document raises no additional security considerations.
