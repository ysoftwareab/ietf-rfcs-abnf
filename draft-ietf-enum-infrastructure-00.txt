1. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC-2119. 
    
2. Introduction 
    
   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a system that transforms 
   E.164 numbers [2] into domain names and then uses the DNS (Domain 
   Name Service) [3] to discover NAPTR records that specify what 
   services are available for a specific domain name. 
 
   ENUM as originally defined, was based on the end-user opt-in 
   principle.  While this has great potential to foster new services and 
   end-user choice in the long-term, the current requirements for IP-
   based interconnection of Voice over IP (VoIP) domains require the 
   provisioning of all allocated or served (hosted) numbers of a 
   participating service provider, without the need for individual users 
   to opt-in or not.  This is particularly important if Infrastructure 
   ENUM is used for number portability applications, for example.   
    
   In addition, while it is possible that service providers could 
   mandate that their users opt-in into e164.arpa through end-user 
   contract terms and conditions, there are substantial downsides to 
   such an approach.  Thus, for all these reasons and many others, ENUM 
   for end-user provisioning is ill-suited for use by service providers 
   for the interconnection of VoIP domains. 
    
   As VoIP evolves and becomes pervasive, E.164-addressed telephone 
   calls need not necessarily traverse the Public Switched Telephone 
   Network (PSTN).  Therefore, VoIP service providers have an interest 
   in using ENUM, on a so-called "Infrastructure" basis, to keep VoIP

   traffic on IP networks on an end-to-end basis, both within and 
   between service provider domains.  
    
   The requirements for Infrastructure ENUM are provided in an ENUM 
   Working Group document, Infrastructure ENUM Requirements [4].  This 
   document defines that Infrastructure ENUM be implemented by means of 
   a parallel namespace to e164.arpa dedicated to Infrastructure ENUM, 
   ie164.arpa. 
   
   Infrastructure ENUM Tier 2 resource records in the Infrastructure 
   ENUM tree would be controlled by the service provider that is 
   providing services to a given E.164 number, generally referred to in 
   various nations as the "carrier of record".  The definition of who 
   controls a given E.164 number is a national matter or is defined by 
   the entity controlling the numbering space.  
 
 
3. IANA Considerations 
 
   RFC 2916 [11] (which was replaced by RFC 3761) requested IANA to 
   delegate the e164.arpa domain following instructions to be provided 
   by the IAB.  This document requests IANA delegate ie164.arpa for 
   Infrastructure ENUM.  Names within this zone are to be delegated to 
   parties according to the International Telecommunications Union's 
   (ITU) Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Recommendation 
   E.164.  The names allocated should be hierarchic in accordance with 
   ITU-T Recommendation E.164, and the codes should be assigned in 
   accordance with that Recommendation. 
    
   The IAB is to coordinate with ITU-T Telecommunication Standardization 
   Bureau (TSB) if the technical contact for the domain ie164.arpa is to 
   change, as ITU-T TSB has an operational working relationship with 
   this technical contact which needs to be reestablished.  Delegations 
   in the zone ie164.arpa (not delegations in delegated domains of 
   ie164.arpa) should be done after Expert Review, and the IESG will 
   appoint a designated expert. 
    
   IANA has created a registry for Enumservices as originally specified 
   in RFC 2916 and revised in RFC 3761.  Enumservices registered with 
   IANA are valid for Infrastructure ENUM as well as end-user ENUM.
