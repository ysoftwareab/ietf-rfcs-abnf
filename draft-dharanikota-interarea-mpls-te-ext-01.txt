1. Abstract
   
   In this draft, we propose the extensions required to the routing
   protocols, signaling protocols, and the MIB to support the idea of
   inter-area LSPs. A companion document [INTER_AREA_REQ] provides the
   architectural requirements for such a concept. This document also
   provides the signaling extensions to support the crankback as defined
   in the architecture document [INTER_AREA-REQ].

3. Introduction
   
   Current work in the MPLS traffic engineering group (such as
   [TE_FRAMEWORK], [QOS_CONST]) focuses only on the intra-area LSP setup
   issues. In this work we propose an architecture to extend the traffic
   engineering capability across IGP areas and recommend relevant
   modifications to the routing protocols, the signaling protocols and
   the MIBs.
   
   The ISPÆs networks are divided into Autonomous Systems (ASs), where
   each AS is divided into Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas to allow
   the hiding and aggregating of routing information. Although this
   concept of hierarchical routing by an IGP makes sense from the routing
   perspective, it is a bottleneck for traffic engineering - as it hides
   the path taken by a packet to destinations in the other routing areas.
   Hence, from the Traffic Engineering (TE) perspective, requirements
   such as path selection and crankback need different architectural
   additions to the existing IGPs and signaling protocols for inter-area
   Label Switched Path (LSP) setup.
   
   Traffic engineering practice currently involves the setup and use of
   LSPs as dedicated bandwidth pipes between two end points. LSPs can be
   setup across several routers, either through the use of manually
   specified routes, or routes that are computed. The routes can be
   computed offline through the use of a dedicated tool, or through the
   use of online constraint based routing using an IGP [IGP_REQ,
   RSVP_EXT].
   
   The offline tool will be centralized, and has the advantage of being
   able to consider the traffic pattern history over a large period of
   time, and hence will be efficient in optimizing the resources over
   time, not just the particular instant when the request is received.
   The offline traffic engineering tool, if also used for LSP setup in
   addition to routing, may be able to optimize the resources across
   LSPs. This would include mechanisms to tear down LSP segments and
   reroute them when better resources become available or new requests
   arrive.
   
   The online constraint based routing model [IGP_REQ] requires (1) a
   constraint based routing process implemented on certain Label Switched
   Routers (LSRs) that serve as Label Edge Routers (LERs) to the LSPs,
   and (2) a set of mechanisms to flood out and maintain the TE
   characteristics of the topology.
   
   From [TOOL_VS_RP] discussion, it is clear that traffic engineering can
   be implemented with the help of tools and routing protocol extensions,
   as initiated by [IGP_REQ]. Although there has been some work in the
   area of realizing some of the issues such as TE crankback [CRANKBACK]
   and DiffServ realizations [QOS_CONST], [QOS_TE_EXT], no work has been
   performed that directly related to the inter-area extensions and a
   framework for such in the TE working group.
   
   In our solution, we propose to send across IGP areas, the summary
   routes containing criteria-based route attributes, which will be used
   at the Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBRs) in their TE path
   computation. Since an off-line TE tool cannot compute the complete
   explicit path from ASBR to ASBR unless it knows the complete routing
   table of the AS, we expect to have loose path specification, which can
   be translated into explicit path in-steps at the intermediate Area
   Border Routers (ABRs). The solutions we are providing in this draft
   are applicable to the destination networks inside the AS or outside
   the AS. For the sake of simplicity we consider the customer networks
   inside an autonomous system.
   
   The companion document [INTER_AREA_REQ] presents the architectural
   requirements for such a solution. In this document, the extensions to
   provide such a solution of criteria-based inter-area routing are
   separated into routing protocol extensions, signaling protocol
   extensions and configuration extensions. In section 4, we present the
   OSPF and IS-IS extensions. The signaling extensions for RSVP and CR-
   LDP are presented in section 5. The configuration extensions for such
   architectural changes are presented in section 6. Security
   considerations, references and acknowledgements follow in sections 7,
   8, and 9 respectively.

4. Routing protocol extensions
   
4.1 Intra-area requirements

   OSPF or ISIS implementation SHOULD support the [INTRA_TE],
   [ISIS_INTRA_TE] extensions to advertise and distribute the TE
   information of the interfaces of the area. In addition, [QOS_TE_EXT]
   may be supported to flood the bandwidth per class type of each
   interface.
   
   [INTRA_TE], [ISIS_INTRA_TE] defines the following TE attributes:
   
      - Traffic engineering metric
      - Maximum bandwidth
      - Maximum reservable bandwidth
      - Unreserved bandwidth
      - Resource class/color
   
   [QOS_TE_EXT] defines the unreserved bandwidth for different class
   types.
   
   Not all of the TE attributes specified in [INTRA_TE], [ISIS_INTRA_TE]
   and [QOS_TE_EXT] need to be supported - in fact a subset may be chosen
   that reflects the traffic engineering condition of the network and
   does not impose a burden on the storage and flooding of the TE
   information.
   
   Specific to OSPF:
   
   When a request for the setup of a constraint based LSP within the area
   is received, a CSPF computation will be performed on the TE resources
   of the area (as specified by the intra-area TE-LSAs) to determine the
   best path that satisfies the constraints. The constraints on the LSP
   can be one or more of the TE attributes flooded by OSPF in the intra-
   area TE LSA.
   
   Specific to ISIS:
   
   When a request for the setup of a constraint based LSP within the area
   is received, a CSPF computation will be performed on the TE resources
   of the area (as specified by the intra-area TE-LSAs) to determine the
   best path that satisfies the constraints of the LSP. The constraints
   on the LSP can be one or more of the TE attributes flooded by ISIS in
   the L1 extended IS reachability TE sub-TLVs.

4.2 Inter-area requirements

   The route computation process uses the inter-area TE summary
   information.
   
      - to determine if a path to the inter-area destination that
        satisfies  the constraints does exist, and
      - to determine the ABR to reach the next area.
   
   TE attribute summarization is similar to the route summarization that
   is already a part of OSPF or ISIS. The TE attributes can be summarized
   through the use of a dijkstra based algorithm as described in section. 
   The value of the TE summary attribute to a destination advertised by
   an ABR represents the TE resources of the best path available from the
   ABR to that destination based on that TE attribute alone.
   
   A separate route calculation is necessary to determine the summary
   value for each TE attribute that needs to be summarized. Since these
   route calculations are based on the intra-area TE attribute values,
   the set of TE attributes to be summarized should be a subset of the
   set of TE attributes supported inside the areas.
   
   In the general case of TE attribute summarization, any number of TE
   attributes such as bandwidth, delay to a destination can be
   summarized. However, since a large number of TE attributes to be
   summarized will result in an increase in processing required, the
   number of TE attributes to be summarized should be kept small.
   
   Specific to OSPF:
   
   The summarized TE attributes will be distributed inside the areas by
   the use of a new link state message (called TE summary LSA) as defined
   in [INTER_TE_OSPF]. The definitions for the various TE attributes in
   the TE summary LSA are also described in [INTER_TE_OSPF]. In addition
   to those TE attributes, the following three TLVs are proposed to be
   added in the TE summary LSA.
   
   Specific to ISIS:
   
   The summarized TE attributes will be distributed inside the areas by
   extending the IP reachability TLV in the L1 and L2 link state PDU to
   include TE sub-TLVs as described below.
   
4.3 Requirements for OSPF
   
4.3.1 Unreserved Bandwidth for CT1 to CT3

   The unreserved bandwidth for class-types 1, 2 and 3 [QOS_CONST] to the
   destination are each individually described in a TLV. The units is
   bytes/second and the representation is IEEE floating point. The TLV
   types are 7, 8, and 9, respectively and the length is 32 octets each.
   
4.4. Requirements for ISIS
   
4.4.1 Traffic Engineering Extensions to the IP Reachability TLV

   This draft extends the IP Reachability TLV in the L1 and L2 link state
   PDUs to allow the representation of TE information in the form of TE
   sub-TLVs. Each TE sub-TLV in the IP Reachability TLV carries the type
   and value of a traffic engineering attribute to the remote
   destination.
   
   An L2 link state PDU containing the IP reachability TLV with the TE
   extensions will be originated by an L1/L2 router and flooded
   throughout the L2 domain. This PDU will contain IP reachability TLV
   with the TE sub-TLVs for each reachable address in the connected
   areas. The value for each TE attribute will have been computed through
   the use of a dijkstra based algorithm as detailed in the next section.
   (This is the 'up' part of the redistribution as detailed in
   [ISIS_TE]).
   
   An L1 link state PDU containing the IP reachability TLV with the TE
   extensions will be originated by an L1/L2 router and flooded
   throughout its connected areas. This PDU will contain IP reachability
   TLV with the TE sub-TLVs for each reachable address in a remote area.
   (This is the 'down' part of the redistribution as detailed in
   [ISIS_TE]).

4.4.2 Format of the IP reachability TLV with TE Sub-TLVs

   The extended IP reachability TLV as described in [ISIS_TE] with TYPE =
   135 is further extended with the addition of the TE sub-TLVs
   describing the traffic engineering attributes to the destination
   network.
   
   Hence the IP reachability TLV has a structure as described in
   [ISIS_TE], followed by zero or more TE sub-TLVs, each of which is of
   the form:
   
                No. of Octets
             +---------------------------+
             |           CODE            |      1
             +---------------------------+
             |          LENGTH           |      1
             +---------------------------+
             |           VALUE           |      LENGTH
             +---------------------------+

4.4.3 The Traffic Engineering Sub-TLVs

   The following traffic engineering attributes are defined:
   
      Sub-TLV type    Length (octets)    Name
       3               4                  Resource Class/Color
       9               4                  Maximum Bandwidth
       10              4                  Reservable Bandwidth
       11              32                 Unreserved Bandwidth
       18              3                  TE Default Metric
       TBD             4                  Delay
       TBD             32                 Unreserved Bandwidth for CT1
       TBD             32                 Unreserved Bandwidth for CT2
       TBD             32                 Unreserved Bandwidth for CT3
   
   Most of these traffic engineering attributes have sizes and types the
   same as in [ISIS_TE]. Note that new traffic engineering attributes and
   sub-TLVs to represent them may be defined in the future. The TE
   attributes are described below.
   
4.4.3.1 Resource Class/Color
   
   The resource class or color of the destination network is a
   combination of the colors for the various paths to the network. The
   sub-TLV type of the resource class/color attribute is 3, and the
   length is 4 octets.
   
4.4.3.2 Maximum Bandwidth
   
   The maximum bandwidth to the destination is described in bytes/second
   as an IEEE floating point number. The sub-TLV type is 9, and the
   length is 4 octets.
   
4.4.3.3 Reservable Bandwidth
   
   The reservable bandwidth to the destination is described in
   bytes/second as an IEEE floating point number. The sub-TLV type is 10,
   and the length is 4 octets.

4.4.3.4 Unreserved Bandwidth
   
   The unreserved bandwidth to the destination is described in
   bytes/second as an IEEE floating point number. The sub-TLV type is 11,
   and the length is 4 octets.

4.4.3.5 Traffic Engineering Metric
   
   The traffic engineering metric represents the traffic engineering cost
   of reaching the destination network from the advertising L2 router.
   The sub-TLV type is 18, and the length of this attribute is 3 octets.
   
4.4.3.6 Delay
   
   The delay attribute is the delay cost to reach the destination network
   in milliseconds, represented as an unsigned (4-byte) long integer. The
   TLV-type is TBD, and the length is 4 octets.
   
4.4.3.7 Unreserved Bandwidth for CT1 to CT3
   
   The unreserved bandwidth for class-types 1, 2 and 3 [QOS_CONST] to the
   destination are each individually described in a sub-TLV. The units is
   bytes/second and the representation is IEEE floating point. The sub-
   TLV types are TBD, and the length is 4 octets.
   
4.5 Summarization of Traffic Engineering Attributes
   
   The traffic engineering metric is an additive metric similar to the
   OSPF/ISIS metrics, but need not be the same. The traffic engineering
   and metric advertised by the router for the given summary destination
   will have been computed in a manner similar to the dijkstra
   computation for the OSPF/ISIS metric.
   
   The delay is an additive metric. The value of the delay attribute for
   a summary destination will have been determined through a dijkstra
   computation based on the delay.
   
   The maximum bandwidth to the summary destination is the largest of all
   path-capacities, each associated with a possible path to the
   destination. The path-capacity is the smallest link capacity of all
   the links in the path. Hence, the maximum bandwidth is the maximum
   amount of traffic that can be sent to that destination, when there is
   no other traffic on the links.
   
   The unreserved bandwidth to the summary destination is the largest of
   all path-unreserved bandwidths, each associated with a possible path
   to the destination. The path-unreserved bandwidth is the smallest
   unreserved bandwidth of all the links in the path. Hence, the
   unreserved bandwidth is the maximum amount of traffic that can
   currently be sent to that destination, the other traffic on the links
   being steady. The unreserved bandwidth for Class-Types 1, 2, and 3
   [QOS_CONST] will be computed similarly.
   
   The value of the color attribute to the summary destination is some
   combination of the path-colors, each associated with a possible path
   to the destination. The path-color is a combination of the colors of
   the links in the path. This combination can be a "logical and" of the
   colors, or a concatenation.
   
5. Signaling Extensions

   The signaling protocol requirements for the setup of the inter-area
   LSP are (as mentioned in [INTE_AREA_REQ]):
   
     1. Signaling SHOULD be extended to carry the criteria based
        elements, such as: Primary criteria (Attribute 1, ..., Attribute N);
        Secondary criteria (Attribute 1, ..., Attribute N).
     2. Signaling SHOULD trigger IGP computation for the explicit route
        in an area at the transit ABRs. If the path, which satisfies the primary
        criteria, is not available then it should trigger for the IGP computation
        of the path for the secondary criteria.
     3. It MAY inform the initiating node about the change the criteria
        for the path set up in the intermediate path. This deliberate
        notification can also be derived when the actual setup is completed.
     4. The intermediate ABRs SHOULD know the difference between the
        primary and the backup LSPs. This enables the signaling component to
        distinguish between the paths taken by the primary LSP during the
        computation of the backup LSP.
     5. The same mechanisms used for the primary LSP setup SHOULD be used
        for the backup LSP setup also.
     6. Crankback in an area SHOULD always be performed from the starting
        ABR of that LSP section. If the path is not available send the
        information one area back and try to perform the computation.
   
5.1 RSVP extensions

   In this section we describe extensions to RSVP for the support of
   Inter-Area LSP setup as described in [INTER_AREA_REQ]. These
   extensions are in addition to the extensions to RSVP as defined in
   [RSVP_EXT] and includes attributes from [QOS_TE_EXT] [TE_FRAMEWORK] as
   sub-objects.
   
   Three new objects are introduced as follows:
   
     -  <INTER AREA CRITERIA> object (from now on is also abbreviated as
        IACO) introduced to carry the primary and the secondary criteria in the
        PATH message.
     -  <INTER AREA CRITERIA USED> object (from now on is also
        abbreviated as IACUO) is introduced in the RESV message to capture the
        route taken by the primary or the secondary PATH message.
     -  <PRIMARY LSP ROUTE> object (from now on abbreviated as PLRO) to
        carry the path followed by the primary LSP in the PATH message.
   
   In the following sections we also demonstrate different uses of ERO
   (EXPLICIT ROUTE OBJECT) and RRO (RECORD ROUTE OBJECT) from the
   [RSVP_EXT] draft. Note that constraint-related objects such as
   <CLASSTYPE> as mentioned in [QOS_TE_EXT] can be sub-objects in the
   IACO. The following table illustrates the objects discussed that are
   relevant for this draft.
   
   Object type                     Message         Importance
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   <INTER AREA CRITERIA>           Path            Mandatory
   <INTER AREA CRITERIA USED>      Resv            Mandatory
   <PRIAMRY LSP ROUTE>             Path            Mandatory
   <DIFFSERV><CLASSTYPE>           Path            Optional
   <TE CONSTRAINTS>                Path            Optional
   <EXPLICIT ROUTE>                Path            Optional
   <RECORD ROUTE>            Path, Resv    Optional but recommended
   
5.1.1 PATH and RESV message format changes

   The IACO can be used very effectively in conjunction with the ERO and
   RRO objects. It is possible that the ERO and RRO options are enabled
   to specify a preferred path and to know the path taken by the LSP
   respectively.
   
   The following list of cases we will illustrate the handling of the
   IACO, IACUO, and PLRO objects in conjunction with the ERO and RRO
   objects.
   
        Case 1: IACO + ERO with strict route option: Here we can have two
           situations in one case the primary fails and the other in which both the
           primary and the secondary fail. The following explain the operation:
             i.      Primary fails: Since the path is strict route a PATHErr message
               will be sent to crankback to the nearest ABR in the path with error code
               for "Primary Criteria Failed". The ABR should attempt to setup the LSP
               with secondary criteria.
            ii.     Primary and secondary fails: When both the primary and the
               secondary fails the source of the LSP setup is informed with the help of
               a PATHErr message with the error code "Primary and Secondary Criteria
               Failed".
        Case 2: IACO + ERO with loose source route option: Here also we have the
           same situation as above except for the choice of different path when
           either the primary or the secondary fails. Also when both the primary and
           the secondary fail we have to go only one previous ABR hop to recomputed
           the path till the source is reached.
        Case 3: IACUO with and without RRO: In the case of no RRO in the RESV
           message the LSP initiating node (Ingress LER) will not know the path
           taken by the primary LSP and hence backup LSP may have overlapping LSP
           sections with the primary. Where as when the RRO object is used, above
           problem can be avoided, with the use of PLRO.
        Case 4: With and without PLRO: When PLRO is present we can avoid
           overlapping segments between the primary and the backup LSPs.
        
5.1.3 Error conditions

   The following are the error conditions

        1       Primary Criteria Failed (with the ABRs traversed)
        2       Secondary Criteria Failed (with the ABRs traversed)
        3       Primary and Secondary Criteria Failed (with the ABRs traversed)
        4       Unknown Criteria
        5       Unknown Object

5.2 CR-LDP extensions

   In this section we describe extensions to CR-LDP for the support of
   Inter-Area LSP setup as described in [INTER_AREA_REQ]. These
   extensions are in addition to the extensions to CR-LDP as defined in
   [CR_LDP] and includes the attributes from [QOS_TE_EXT], [TE_FRAMEWORK]
   as sub-objects.
   
   Three new objects are introduced as follows:
   
     -  <INTER AREA CRITERIA TLV> (from now on is also abbreviated as
        IACO) introduced to carry the primary and the secondary criteria in the
        Label Request message.
     -  <INTER AREA CRITERIA USED TLV> (from now on is also abbreviated
        as IACUO) is introduced in the Label Mapping message to capture the route
        taken by the primary or the secondary Label Request message.
     -  <PRIMARY LSP ROUTE TLV> (from now on abbreviated as PLRO) to
        carry the path followed by the primary LSP in the Label Request message.
   
   Note that constraint-related TLVs such as <CLASSTYPE> as mentioned in
   [QOS_TE_EXT] can be sub-TLVs in the IACO. The following table
   illustrates the objects discussed that are relevant for this draft.
   
   Object type                     Message         Importance

5.2.2 Handling of the new objects

   The following are the message formats for the new objects that are
   introduced in this document.
   
   The INTER AREA CRITERIA TLV has the following format:

  0                   1                   2                   3

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   
   This TLV has both the primary and the secondary criteria sub-TLVs.
   Notice that the U and F bits are set to æ0Æ to abort the connection
   setup in case any LSP does not know how to use these mechanisms.
   
   The PRIMARY/SECONDARY CRITERIA sub-TLV format:
   
  0                   1                   2                   3

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   
   The sub TLV carries either the Primary or the Secondary criteria. Each
   of these criteria has a list of constraints as exemplified in the
   above message format. Also note that the U and F flags are set to æ0Æ.
   
   The INTER AREA CRITERIA USED TLV has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   
   The Inter Area Criteria Used TLV has a Criteria Used field ôUsedö,
   which will be set to:
   
     0  for primary criteria,
     1  for secondary criteria and
     15 for none
     
   PRIMARY LSP ROUTE TLV format:
   
      0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   This TLV contains the path taken by the Primary LSP. It can have IPV4
   or IPV6 address hops taken by this path.
   
   The IACO can be used very effectively in conjunction with the Explicit
   Route (ER) TLV and Path Vector (PV) TLV. It is possible that the ER
   TLV and PV TLV options are enabled to specify preferred path and to
   know the path taken by the LSP respectively.
   
   The following list of cases we will illustrate the handling of the
   IACO, IACUO, and PLRO TLVs in conjunction with the ER TLV and PR TLV.
   
        Case 1: IACO + ER TLV with strict route option: Here we can have two
           situations in one case the primary fails and the other in which both the
           primary and the secondary fail. The following explain the operation:
             i.      Primary fails: Since the path is strict route a LDP Notification
               message will be sent to crankback to the nearest ABR in the path with
               error code for "Primary Criteria Failed". The ABR should attempt to setup
               the LSP with secondary criteria.
             ii.     Primary and secondary fails: When both the primary and the
               secondary fails the source of the LSP setup is informed with the help of
               a LDP Notification message with the error code "Primary and Secondary
               Criteria Failed".
        Case 2: IACO + ER TLV with loose source route option: Here also we have
           the same situation as above except for the choice of different path when
           either the primary or the secondary fails. Also when both the primary and
           the secondary fail we have to go only one previous ABR hop to recomputed
           the path till the source is reached.
        Case 3: IACUO with and without PV TLV: In the case of no PV TLV in the
           LDP Mapping message the LSP initiating node (Ingress LER) will not know
           the path taken by the primary LSP and hence backup LSP may have
           overlapping LSP sections with the primary. Where as when the PV TLV is
           used, above problem can be avoided, with the use of PLRO.
        Case 4: With and without PLRO: When PLRO is present we can avoid
           overlapping segments between the primary and the secondary LSPs.

5.2.3 Status codes for the inter-area LSP setup

   In the procedures described above, certain errors must be reported.
   The following values are defined for the Status Code field:
   
   Status Code                             E               Status Data
   
   Primary Criteria Failed                 0               TBD
   Secondary Criteria Failed               0               TBD
   Primary and Secondary Criteria Failed   0               TBD
   Unknown Criteria                        0               TBD
   Unknown TLV                             0               TBD
   
   Note: The criteria failures should always inform the ABR path taken
   for the current reservation.
   
6. MIB requirements (TBD)

   The configuration requirements for such architecture can be divided
   into:
   
     - Routing configuration, such as criteria filtering, criteria-
       constraint mapping, route filtering for criteria summarization etc.
     - LSP Setup configuration, such as primary criteria and backup
       criteria etc.
     - Signaling configuration, such as the criteria change in the
       intermediate segment notification, crankback in-progress notification
       required etc.
   
   These configuration information will be further elaborated in the
   later versions of this draft.

7. Security Considerations (TBD)
