 Abstract 

    Mobile multicast is a research hotspot and gets more and more study 
    recently. But the current mobility management specifications can not 
    provide effective multicast packets transmission, and existing mobile 
    multicast schemes are not generally accepted. In this memo, we 
    discuss the problems arising from mobile multicast and address the 
    solutions of MIPv6 extensions to support mobile multicast services.

 1. Introduction 

    With the development of various mobile technologies, mobile multicast 
    becomes more important because it can provide many applications such 
    as mobile conference, on-line game. Mobile multicast has to solve 
    mobility problem of multicast subscriber (multicast source and

    multicast receiver) and it includes link layer handover such as WLAN, 
    WiMAX, UMTS and network layer handover such as MIPv6 [2] and its 
    variants such as FMIPv6 [9], HMIPv6 [10]and NEMO [3] which can 
    provide the mobility support for mobile node or mobile network. 
    However, these specifications do not provide an effective method to 
    support mobile multicast services.  

    MIPv6 is designed to support unicast communication by caching the 
    binding between HoA and CoA of MN, and route the packets addressed to 
    HoA to CoA transparently. As for the multicast data, two basic 
    methods, Bi-directional Tunnel (BT) and Remote Subscribe (RS) methods 
    were proposed. BT is transparent and has lower join latency, but 
    introduces triangular routing and additional transmission overheads. 
    While RS has effective routing, but increases long join delay 
    especially when foreign networks do not have the multicast states of 
    MN interested, and even result in multicast service disruption if 
    foreign networks do not support multicast. Based on BT and RS, 
    several improved schemes were proposed in past few years [11], and 
    try to make the tradeoff between BT and RS, using different multicast 
    agent selection algorithms or modifying the mobility support 
    specifications [12].  

    The prime problem of mobile multicast is that the current mobility 
    support specifications such as MIPv6 can not provide effective 
    multicast transmission mechanism. The binding cache in MIPv6 only 
    records the mapping between HoA and CoA which can be used to reroute 
    the unicast packets directly. However, for multicast data, no such 
    mechanism is defined. So, in this memo, we specify the problems scope 
    for MIPv6 extensions of mobile multicast and describe the potential 
    solutions.  

 2. Terminology 

    The terminology used in this memo is already defined in MIPv6, FMIPv6, 
    HMIPv6 and NEMOv6. 

 3. Problem Description 

    Mobile multicast derives from the development of Mobile IP and 
    multicast and the current mobile multicast schemes are mainly based 
    on the combination of multicast and Mobile IP. So, the mobile 
    multicast problem comes from two parts, first part is multicast and 
    the second part is mobility support specifications.  

    Multicast provides an effective group communication mechanism in IP 
    layer to reduce the redundant packets, and it is based on host group 
    model [6] which consists of multicast route protocol such as PIM-SM

    [7] and multicast group control protocol such as MLDv1 [4] and MLDv2 
    [5]. Multicast routing protocol constructs the multicast delivery 
    tree and maintains the multicast group states in multicast router, 
    while multicast control protocol is used by multicast router and host 
    to exchange the multicast services information. Multicast supports 
    dynamic membership but does not support mobile group members. As a 
    result, to provide multicast services for mobile host, both multicast 
    route protocol and multicast control protocol face new challenges.

 3.1. General issues 

    Traditional multicast routing protocols have been designed 
    considering static network topology, and the multicast delivery tree 
    is stable and little changed. Figure 1 shows the classification of 
    mobile multicast, including mobile source, mobile receiver or mobile 
    forwarder. Directly applying traditional multicast route protocols to 
    mobile scenario may result in multicast session disruption. To 
    improve the performance of multicast services, it has to solve the 
    following problems.

 3.1.1. Reconstruction of multicast delivery tree 

    The foundational problem in mobile multicast is the reconstruction of 
    multicast delivery tree. There are two kinds of multicast delivery 
    trees, source-based tree such as DVMRP, MOSPF, PIM-DM and PIM-SSM, 
    and shared tree such as PIM-SM and CBT. Source-based protocols 
    construct multicast delivery trees for every source in a group, while 
    shared tree protocols construct a RP or Core based multicast delivery 
    tree for a group. When we implement mobile multicast, the same mobile 
    types in different multicast delivery tree may have different results.  

 3.1.2. Mobile source issues 

    Once source changes its attachment, it will affect all receivers in 
    the group. Firstly, transparency is the major issue for mobile source. 
    Mobile source should hide the mobility and use the HoA as the source 
    address of multicast data. Otherwise, the foreign network will not 
    forward these packets. However, using the HoA will result in the 
    ingress filtering problem and RPF check failure. Secondly, packet 
    loss has an important impact on the performance of mobile multicast 
    services. Thirdly, when mobile source is out of the range of group, 
    the AR to which mobile source is attached will discard the multicast 
    packets from the mobile source which will be considered as a foreign 
    source.  

 3.1.3. Mobile receiver issues  

    Once receiver changes its attachment, it only affects itself, and 
    causes join delay and packet loss.  

 3.1.4. Mobile forwarder issues  

    Mobile forwarder is the node in the multicast delivery tree. Once 
    forwarder changes its attachment, it will affect the receivers in the 
    multicast route path. Although mostly mobile multicast schemes only 
    focus on the mobility in the access networks, the mobility in the 
    core networks should also be considered forward mobility.  

 3.2. Mobility support specification issues 

    Mobile IP provides handover management and location management for 
    mobile entity, and it sets up the binding cache between HoA and CoA 
    to support the transparent unicast route. But, it does not provide 
    mechanisms to enable multicast session to survive handover and to 
    seamlessly continue from the new location.  


  
  
 Zhang, Guan et al.     Expires January 2, 2008                [Page 5]

    Firstly, MIPv6 should not only record the unicast binding cache, but 
    also record the multicast binding cache to assist the mobile 
    multicast. Multicast binding cache may include the group address, 
    source lists, filter mode and interface identifier. It gets the 
    membership information through the tunneled MLD messages or extended 
    signaling and gets the MN information from unicast binding cache. The 
    Multicast binding cache can be located in the HA or the other entity 
    such as Rendezvous Point in PIM-SM.  

    Secondly, Multicast session consists of multicast data transmission 
    and multicast group control messages transmission. HA should 
    distinguish the owner of MLD messages from the MN and intercepts and 
    tunnels the global scoped multicast packets on home network based on 
    the multicast group control protocol. MN should send the MLD messages 
    to HA through tunnel or AR through physical interface to receive the 
    multicast data from HA or AR respectively. As described in MIPv6, to 
    support mobile multicast, HA should be a full IPv6 multicast router 
    or have the proxy MLD function coupled with kernel multicast 
    forwarding. However, MIPv6 does not define the detailed mechanisms 
    and the functional requirements for HA and MN. To support the 
    seamless multicast handover, HA should cooperate the MIPv6 with 
    multicast routing protocol or proxy MLD, and sets up the multicast 
    information for MN and transmits the native multicast packets between 
    HA and MN.  

    Thirdly, Mobile IP based mobile multicast schemes have to solve the 
    route optimization problem. BT and RS are two basic mobile multicast 
    methods, but both of them have the disadvantages. Thomas C. Schmidt 
    and Matthias Waehlisch [12] classify mobile multicast methods into 
    three kinds, BT based, RS based and Agent based. BT based methods use 
    the bi-directional tunnel to transmit the multicast data between old 
    location and new location of mobile entity, but result in tunnel 
    convergence problem and additional overheads. Using IP tunnels 
    involves multiple encapsulation and de-capsulation operations which 
    require an extra cost of CPU time and memory, and increase the 
    multicast packet size which causes fragmentation and large bandwidth 
    consumption. [11] RS based methods rejoin the multicast delivery tree 
    in new location, but introduce additional join delay, which includes 
    L2 and L3 handover delay, multicast membership protocol delay, 
    multicast delivery tree computation delay, and the increased 
    propagation delay. It makes the multicast session instantaneous and 
    degrades the performance of multicast services. Agent based methods 
    try to balance between BT and RS, but increase the complexity. It 
    needs more signaling to select the multicast agent and reconstruct 
    the multicast tree for mobile entity.

 3.3. Multicast control protocol issues 

    IPv6 multicast router uses the MLD as the multicast group control 
    protocol to discovery the multicast listeners, while the host uses 
    the MLD to join and leave the group. MLD protocol is designed for 
    fixed nodes, and only focuses on the dynamic group membership, but 
    not considers the mobility of node. To support the mobile multicast, 
    MLD protocol has to solve the following problems.  

    Firstly, mobile entity has to send unsolicited MLD report message 
    immediately after detecting the movement to shorten the rejoin delay. 
    However, the rejoin delay results in many packets lost unfortunately 
    even without including the link layer and IP layer handover delay. 
    MLD can not maintain multicast group membership continually. As a 
    result, we should increase new MLD message types to support mobile 
    entity.  

    Secondly, MLD messages are link-local, destined to a link-scope 
    multicast address and have a hop limit of 1 and can not forward to 
    the other subnets. When mobile multicast subscriber moves into 
    another subnet, it has to reconstruct MLD states in the new location. 
    However, the MLD protocol does not provide this mechanism. How to 
    transfer the MLD state between old location and new location affects 
    the performance of multicast services.  

    Thirdly, MLD protocol only records the multicast membership 
    information for every link not the node, which can reduce the number 
    of multicast states in shared link such 802.11. But for some point-
    to-point links such as UMTS, HA assigns a home link prefix that is 
    unique for each MN and HoA is assigned from this unique prefix. As a 
    result, it makes a link for each MN. So the multicast behavior could 
    be simplified. Extend the MLD to record MLD state for MN in point-to-
    point link is preferable.  

 3.4. Multi-hop mobile multicast issues 

    The current mobile multicast schemes mainly are single-hop based, and 
    the distance between mobile multicast subscribers and the AR is one 
    hop. However, mobile network multicast especially MANET multicast 
    interworking with the fixed networks is multi-hop. As for the NEMO 
    multicast, the node in the mobile network such as LFN, VMN joins the 
    multicast group through MR which may be multiple hops to the access 
    networks. MLD messages and multicast packets can not be forwarded if 
    the router in the path to AR does not support the multicast function. 
    Especially when nesting happens, the multicast packets transmission 
    will suffers from large overheads and extra propagation delay, which 
    result in degrade of multicast services performance significantly. As 
  
  
 Zhang, Guan et al.     Expires January 2, 2008                [Page 7] 
     
 Internet-Draft               MEMCAST-PS                      July 2007 
     

    for the MANET multicast interworking with the fixed networks, every 
    node in the MANET may be dynamic and get the connection through 
    multiple nodes as relay points. Because the mobile devices have 
    limited bandwidth, power, and coverage, the multi-hop mobile 
    multicast scheme should be light-weight. How to provide multicast 
    service for these nodes in the mobile network should be considered in 
    the further study. 

 3.5. Multihoming mobile multicast issues 

    Most mobile multicast methods including mobile network multicast are 
    based on single interface and connect to one AR at a time, which 
    results in the mobile entity having to break the connection to the 
    current network before reattaching itself to the new network (Break-
    Before-Mobile) [13]. The reason is that the current wireless 
    interface of mobile devices is incapable of listening to multiple 
    base stations. As a result, the multicast session will be disrupted 
    because of the serious packet loss.  

    Recently, more and more mobile devices have multiple interfaces and 
    can support more than one Internet connections at a time 
    (multihoming). Using multiple interfaces will provide Make-Before-
    Break handoffs [14], ubiquitous access, redundancy, load balancing. 
    However, realizing the multihoming mobile multicast has to consider 
    the problems inheriting from the MIPv6 multihoming [32]. Firstly, to 
    use the multiple interfaces simultaneously, MN should bind multiple 
    CoAs to a given HoA, but the current MIPv6 specification is lacking 
    such ability. Secondly, when multiple paths from and to MN, MN should 
    choose a suitable one to transmit the multicast packets, which 
    includes the interface selection, HoA and CoA selection. Thirdly, 
    when current path fails, MN should redirect the flow to the new path. 
    Final, to balance the multicast traffic among multiple interfaces, MN 
    should set up a load balance mechanism.  

 4. Solutions 

    Mobile IP based mobile multicast solutions include MIPv6 variants 
    extensions, MLD extensions, aiming to support multicast mobility. 
    These extensions usually put the multicast information in signaling 
    or transfer MLD state among ARs to reduce the re-join delay and 
    realize optimal multicast packets transmission.

 4.1. MIPv6 extensions 

 4.1.1. MIPv6 signaling extensions 

    Most mobile multicast schemes extend the MIPv6 to carry the multicast 
    information in signaling. In basic MIPv6, BT method transmits the MLD 
    messages and multicast packets through the unicast tunnel. Based on 
    RS, F. Xia and B. Sarikaya [15] propose FMIPv6 extension for 
    multicast handover, which introduces a new Multicast Group 
    Information Option (MGIO) in Fast Binding Update (FBU) and Handover 
    Initiate (HI). To reduce the join delay, PAR transmits multicast 
    group information to NAR through FBU and HI with the MGIO to join the 
    multicast group in advance. Then Georigios A. Leoleis et al. [16] 
    propose Fast MIPv6 extensions for Multicast handover support with 
    Flow Tunneling and Buffering (M-FMIPv6/FTB), which uses the 
    conditional tunneling of multicast traffic per flow to solve the 
    tunnel convergence. Besides, it proposes a simple buffering technique 
    to eliminate multicast data loss. More recently, Dong-Hee Kwon et al. 
    [17] proposed an efficient multicast support scheme for FMIPv6. It 
    introduces new multicast options in mobility header and ICMP header, 
    which contain the multicast group information MN subscribed. To 
    reduce the join delay, NAR setups the multicast states MN interested 
    in advance by the FMIPv6 operation. Beside, it establishes a 
    multicast specific tunnel between PAR and NAR instead of the unicast 
    tunnel between PAR and NCoA to solve the tunnel coverage problem. 
    Based on BT, Thomas Schmidt et al. [18] proposed seamless multicast 
    handover in a HMIPv6 environment (M-HMIPv6), which uses the MAP as 
    anchor point for mobile multicast and transmits all multicast data 
    through this MAP using Regional CoA (RCoA) for multicast receiver or 
    source.  

 4.1.2. Multicast route optimization 

    Multicast route optimization aims to solve the tunnel convergence 
    problem and realize the native multicast transmission. Agent based 
    schemes described in [12] mainly focus on these problems. The 
    multicast agent takes over the multicast packets transmission 
    function, and sets up the optimal routing to mobile multicast 
    subscriber. For example, M-FMIPv6 [19] chooses every AR as the agent 
    while M-HMIPv6 chooses the MAP as the agent. DMA [20] chooses the 
    dynamic multicast agent based and distance and movement.  

 4.2. MLD extensions 

    Christophe Jelger and Thomas Noel [23] introduces a new type of MLD 
    message called MLD hold message, which is used to notify an HA to

    stop forwarding multicast data for specified group, but keep the 
    group membership. 

    To transfer the multicast state in advance, MN should have the 
    ability to identify whether the AR has the multicast function or not 
    at first. B. Haberman and J. Martin [8] propose Multicast Router 
    Discovery (MRD), a general mechanism to discovery the multicast 
    routers. MRD introduces Multicast Router Advertisement (MRA) and 
    Multicast Router Solicitation (MRS) to detect the IP multicast 
    forwarding ability of a router. MRD protocol can be used in mobile 
    multicast to help the mobile entity to realize the native multicast 
    data transmission. After detecting the multicast ability, the mobile 
    entity should transfer the MLD states to the candidate AR. Based on 
    context transfer [21], I. Miloucheva and K. Jonas [22] propose fast 
    mobile multicast in IPv6 based on multicast listening context 
    transfer method to transmit the MLD states among ARs.  

 4.3. Multi-hop mobile multicast 

    Mobile entity may have multiple Internet connections at the same time 
    and attaches to multiple networks, which have different coverage, 
    bite rate, bandwidth. How to implement mobile multicast in 
    multihoming scenarios may be the key to provide the seamless mobile 
    multicast handover.  

    As for NEMO multicast, C. Janneteau et al. [24] propose MLD-proxy 
    based IPv6 multicast for mobile network, which deploys MLD-based 
    multicast forwarding (MLD-proxying) between MR and visited networks 
    to support the multicast service in mobile network. Kiyong Park et al. 
    [25] propose a dynamic multicast tree construction mechanism for 
    mobile network. It sets up the multicast tunnel between MR and 
    multicast router to support the multicast services.  

    As for the MANET multicast interworking with fixed networks, Wei Ding 
    [26] introduces a Multicast GateWay (MGW) entity to realize multicast 
    routing in the mixed network. MGW has both wire-line multicast 
    interface and wireless communication interface and supports both 
    multicast route protocols. At the beginning it joins the multicast 
    groups on both sides explicitly transmit data packets. However, it 
    has been less focused on the multiple MGWs scenario. Then P. Ruiz and 
    A. Skarmeta propose the Multicast MAnet Routing Protocol (MMARP) [27]. 
    It introduces Multicast Internet Gateway (MIG) and uses the on-demand 
    multicast protocol to construct the multicast structure in the MANET, 
    maintains the route to the MIG. Besides, MMARP supports a standard 
    mobile node accessing the Internet through the MANET. MIG keep the 
    connectivity with the AR through the IGMP inquire message. However, 
    the existed schemes still need further study to solve problems such

    as multicast security, management etc. Afterwards Wang et al. propose 
    a Modified MLD (M.MLD) scheme [28] which modifies the MLD messages 
    for MANET to realize the IPv6 multicast between fixed network and 
    MANET. In this scheme the access router in the MANTE is deployed as a 
    Designated Router (DR) of the fixed network, and M.MLD is used as the 
    multicast membership management protocol in the MANET by 
    encapsulating in the unicast packets. More recently, IETF MANET WG 
    proposes a Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) for MANET [29] and 
    tries to support interoperability with connected wired infrastructure. 
    Zhang hui et al. [30] proposes a multicast interworking scheme 
    between MANET and fixed network which supports cross-network 
    multicast sessions. It uses the Certificate Authority (CA) [31] to 
    manage the cross-network multicast sessions and insure the multicast 
    security.  

 4.4. Multihoming mobile multicast 

    Current most mobile multicast schemes based on single interface to 
    perform multicast handover, which is less stable and reliable. Once 
    MN or MR lost its connection to Internet, it will have a significant 
    impact on performance of mobile multicast. Recently, the multihoming 
    issues in MIPv6 [32] [33] and NEMO [34] were discussed. MN with 
    multiple addresses which allocated to either a single interface or 
    multiple interfaces can provide ubiquitous, permanent and fault-
    tolerant access to the Internet.  

    Zhang et al. [35] propose a multiple interfaces mobile multicast 
    scheme in Mobile IPv6 and NEMO. The interfaces in the MN may be 
    homogeneous or heterogeneous. This scheme introduces an interface 
    multicast state transition mechanism and multiple interfaces handover 
    mechanism for mobile multicast listeners and mobile multicast sources 
    to support seamless mobile multicast handover.  

 5. Security Considerations 

    This memo discusses the MIPv6 extensions for mobile multicast. 
    Security issues arise from the extensions of mobility support 
    specifications and MLD protocols.  

 6. IANA Considerations 

    There are no IANA considerations introduced by this memo. 

 7. Conclusions 

    This memo discusses the problems arise from the mobile multicast over 
    MIPv6 variants, and describes some solutions.
