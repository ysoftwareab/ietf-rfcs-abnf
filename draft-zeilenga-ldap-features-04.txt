Abstract

  The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an extensible
  protocol with numerous elective features.  This document introduces a
  general mechanism for discovery of elective features and extensions
  which cannot be discovered using existing mechanisms.

INTERNET-DRAFT           LDAP supportedFeatures            4 August 2002


1. Background and Intended Use

  LDAP [RFC2251] is an extensible protocol with numerous elective
  features.  LDAP provides mechanisms for a client to discover supported
  protocol versions, controls, extended operations, SASL mechanisms, and
  subschema information.  However, these mechanisms are not designed to
  support general feature discovery.

  This document describes a simple, general-purpose mechanism which
  clients may use to discover the set of elective features supported by
  a server.  For example, this mechanism could be used by a client to
  discover whether or not the server supports request for all
  operational attributes, e.g. "+" [OPATTRS].  As another example, this
  mechanism could be used to discover absolete true, e.g. "(&)" and
  false, e.g. "(|)", search filters [T-F] support.

  This document extends the IANA LDAP Protocol Mechanism registry
  [LDAPIANA] to support registration of values of the supportedFeatures
  attribute.

  Schema definitions are provided using LDAPv3 description formats
  [RFC2252].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for
  readability.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


2. Discovery of supported features

  Each elective feature whose support may be discovered SHALL be
  identified by an Object Identifier (OID).  A server advertises its
  support for a given feature by providing the OID associated with the
  feature as a value of the 'supportedFeatures' attribute held in the
  root DSE.  A client may examine the values of this attribute to
  determine if a particular feature is supported by the server.  A
  client MUST ignore values it doesn't recognize as they refer to
  elective features it doesn't implement.

  Features associated with Standard Track protocol mechanisms MUST be
  registered.  Features associated with other protocol mechanisms SHOULD
  be registered.  Procedures for registering protocol mechanisms are are
  described in [LDAPIANA].  "Feature" should be placed in the usage
  field of the submitted LDAP Protocol Mechanism template.

  The 'supportedFeatures' attribute type is described as follows:

INTERNET-DRAFT           LDAP supportedFeatures            4 August 2002


      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.3.5
        NAME 'supportedFeatures'
        DESC 'features supported by the server'
        EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38
        USAGE dSAOperation )

  Servers MUST be capable of recognizing this attribute type by the name
  'supportedFeatures'.  Servers MAY recognize the attribute type by
  other names.


4. Security Considerations

  As rogue clients can discover features of a server by other means
  (such as by trial and error), this feature discovery mechanism is not
  believed to introduce any new security risk to LDAP.


5. IANA Considerations

  5.1. Registration of Features as Protocol Mechanisms

  Future specifications detail LDAP features are to be registered as
  LDAP Protocol Mechanisms per guidance provided in [LDAPIANA].  A usage
  of "Feature" in a Protocol Mechanism registration template indicates
  that the value to be registered is associated with an LDAP feature.


  5.2. Registration of the supportedFeature descriptor

  It is requested that IANA register upon Standards Action the LDAP
  'supportedFeatures' descriptor.  The following registration template
  is suggested:

      Subject: Request for LDAP Descriptor Registration
      Descriptor (short name): supportedFeatures
      Object Identifier: 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.3.5
      Person & email address to contact for further information:
          Kurt Zeilenga <kurt@OpenLDAP.org>
      Usage: Attribute Type
      Specification: RFCXXXX
      Author/Change Controller: IESG


  This OID was assigned [ASSIGN] by OpenLDAP Foundation under its IANA
  assigned private enterprise allocation [PRIVATE] for use in this
  specification.
