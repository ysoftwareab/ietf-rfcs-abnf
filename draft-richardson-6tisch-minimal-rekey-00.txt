             Minimal Security rekeying mechanism for 6TiSCH
                draft-richardson-6tisch-minimal-rekey-00

Abstract

   This draft describes a mechanism to rekey the networks used by 6TISCH
   nodes.  It leverages the security association created during an
   enrollment protocol.  The rekey mechanism permits incremental
   deployment of new sets of keys, followed by a rollover to a new key.

1.  Introduction

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These
   words may also appear in this document in lowercase, absent their
   normative meanings.

   The reader is expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   defined in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology], [RFC7252],
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security], and
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].

3.  An approach to rekeying

   TBD

4.  A YANG model for keys

   It optionally also contains an IEEE 802.15.4 short-address
   [IEEE8021542015] assigned to pledge by JRC.

5.  Rekey of master connection

   TBD
