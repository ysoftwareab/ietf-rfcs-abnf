Abstract 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based management of Network Address Translation and transparent 
   bridging functionality within a CableHome compliant residential 
   gateway.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the 
   SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP 
   framework and existing SNMP standards.

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [12]. 
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [7], STD 58, RFC 2579 [8] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [9].

2. Glossary 
    
   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable 
   system usage, from normal residential gateway operation, or from the 
   documents associated with the CableHome Specifications [21]. 
    
2.1 CATV 
    
   Originally "Community Antenna Television", now used to refer to any 
   cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals 
   to a community. 
       
2.2 CableHome Residential Gateway 
    
   A CableHome Residential gateway passes data traffic between the cable 
   operator's broadband data network (the Wide Area Network, WAN) and 
   the Local Area Network (LAN) in the cable data service subscriber's 
   residence or business. In addition to passing traffic between the WAN 
   and LAN, the CableHome Residential Gateway provides several services 
   including a DHCP client and a DHCP server (RFC2131) [22], a TFTP 
   server (RFC1350) [23], management services as enabled by 
   SNMPv1/v2c/v3 agent compliant with the RFCs listed in Section 1, and 
   security services including stateful packet inspection firewall 
   functionality and software code image verification using techniques. 
        
2.3 Portal Services 
    
   A logical element aggregating the set of CableHome-specified 
   functionality in a CableHome compliant cable gateway device. 
    
2.4 CAP (CableHome Address Portal) 
    
   The logical function within the Cable Gateway Device which provides 
   the NAT/NAPT routing and transparent bridging functions. 
    
    
3. Overview 
    
   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of CAP 
   NAT/NAPT and transparent bridging functions within CableHome 
   compliant Residential Gateways (RG).  The MIB is derived from the 
   CableHome Specification. 
    
   Depending on the configuration of the CAP, a CableHome RG will 
   perform either standard NAT Network Address Translation or NAPT 
   Network Address Port Translation.  It is also possible to configure 
   the CableHome RG to provide only NAT/NAPT functions,transparent 
   bridging functions, or a combination of the two.

Internet-Draft     CableHome Gateway Addressing MIB         March 2003 
 
   The NAT/NAPT function of the CableHome RG generally translates 
   traffic to and from privately addressed devices in the home network 
   to one (NAPT) or more (NAT) public addresses that are provisioned 
   into the RG for this purpose. 
    
   In order for the CableHome RG to support devices and applications 
   that are NAT/NAPT intolerant, the RG also supports a type of 
   transparent bridging, which we call Passthrough, by configuring the 
   RG to bridge traffic for all devices on the home network or to bridge 
   traffic to and from particular hardware addresses on the home 
   network. 
    
3.1 Structure of the MIB 
    
   This MIB is structured into two groups: 
    
   1. The cabhCapBase group provides a mechanism to define the 
   inactivity timeouts for TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic types.  It also 
   provides a mechanism to set the Primary Packet-handling Mode of the 
   RG û either NAT, NAPT, or Passthrough.  Finally, this group provides 
   a means to reset most MIB values defined in this MIB to their factory 
   defaults. 
    
   2. The cabhCapMap group contains information pertaining to the 
   NAT/NAPT routing and transparent bridging (Passthrough) functions of 
   the RG.  The cabhCapMap group consists of two tables: 
    
   û cabhCapMappingTable: Allows for creating and monitoring static and 
     dynamic NAT and NAPT mappings. 
 
   û cabhCapPassthroughTable: Allows for configuring the RG to 
     transparently bridge traffic based on hardware addresses of 
     devices on the home network. 
    
    
3.2 Management Requirements 
    
   In addition to the explicit requirements in this specification, the 
   Cable Gateway MUST support all applicable CableHome and IETF 
   requirements and MIB objects.

6. Formal Syntax 
    
    
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [3]. 
    
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
    
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and 
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide 
   features for such a secure environment. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects 
   in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator

   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
