Abstract 
   
   This draft describes the use of COPS-PR for support of a PDP 
   provisioning a PEP with RSVP policy control criteria and defines a 
   RSVP policy control criteria PIB for this purpose. The RSVPCC-PIB 
   described in the document is provided for definition of policies that 
   are currently defined by the outsourcing model [2749]. It is designed 
   to be scalable and flexible as well as extensible for accommodating 
   future policy criteria.

1. Introduction 
    
   The RSVP Policy Control Criteria PIB defines the policy criteria used 
   to authorize an RSVP reservation request. The policy criteria defined 
   by this PIB are enforced by the RSVP enabled Policy Enforcement Point 
   (PEP). These are provisioned by the Policy Decision Point (PDP) 
   rather than outsourced to the PDP.   
        
   Policy control is an important processing component described in RSVP 
   [2205]. While admission control evaluates the resources available at 
   the RSVP enabled interface, it does not determine if the requested 
   reservation is allowed. Policy control determines whether the policy 
   is allowed (or authorized.) It may base the decision on multiple 
   factors including application identification, policy authentication 
   preemption rules and service level agreements.  
        
   Two basic models are defined for prescribing policy to a network 
   enforcement device using COPS [2748]. First, there is an outsourcing 
   mechanism for policy control where the network device requests a 
   policy decision from an external policy server[2749]. This mechanism 
   can be used in conjunction with a local decision policy scheme that 
   outsources information to the PDP for confirmation of the locally 
   made decision [2753]. There also exists a policy configuration 
   mechanism that does not require the network device to outsource all 
   policy decisions. The device is provisioned with decision policy 
   using Policy Information Bases (PIB) that define the policies to be 
   enforced by the PEP. [3084.]  
        
   Currently there is no PIB defining RSVP policy control criteria to be 
   conveyed by the provisioning model. Provisioned policy control 
   criteria are useful in topologies where large numbers of signaling 
   flows are transiting a set of well know boundary devices.  The sheer 
   volume and nature of the application generating RSVP signals (such as 
   with VoIP) may make outsourcing policy impractical at some boundary 
   devices. The use of local policy control criteria is an attractive 
   alternative to going off-board to another policy device for all PATH 
   and RESV messages and their associated contexts (Incoming  / 
   Allocation / Outgoing), which reduces the response time of policy 
   control, the amount of policy control traffic on the network, and 
   overall QoS setup time for the application.  
    
   Reliance on a network operator to manually provision the policy 
   criteria locally per device is not a scalable solution. It is labor-
   intensive, time-consuming as well as error prone and it limits the 
   flexibility of policy control.  The automated provisioning of RSVP 
   criteria by the PDP expands the uses of QoS reservation policy to 
   dynamic, high volume QoS sensitive applications. 
    
2 General Concepts  
        
2.1 Overview  
        
  
Rawlins et al.          Expires  November 2002                [Page 3] 

Internet Draft               RSVP-PCC-PIB               November  2001 
 
 
   This document defines a RSVP Policy Control Criteria PIB. The RSVP 
   Policy Control Criteria PIB provides the policy classes describing 
   the criteria for RSVP policy control to the PEP so it does not need 
   to outsource decisions for all RSVP signals.  
        
   Together with the PIB defined in this document, COPS-PR is used to 
   push RSVP related policy control criteria from a PDP to a PEP. Thus 
   the RSVP policy control criteria are installed on the PEP a priori of 
   the affected RSVP signals and enables making policy control decisions 
   for the RSVP messages locally at the PEP.  
        
   The use of provisioned policy criteria does not prohibit the 
   outsourcing of policy decisions. The outsourcing and provisioned 
   policy approaches may be used in combination with each other as 
   defined by the following three processing models:  
      - Make local decisions AND outsource each request to the PDP for 
        confirmation as described in [2753].  
      - Make local decisions and outsource ONLY IF no relevant local 
        policy is found.  
      - Take local decisions only. Do not outsource.  
          
   Feedback must be provided to the PDP about the usage of policy at the 
   PEP. The PEP monitors, tracks and provides periodic accounting type 
   reports to the PDP.   
        
2.2 Normal Operation  
        
   When a PEP is initialized, a COPS session connection is established 
   for SUBJECT_CATEGORY RSVP-PCC between the PEP and PDP. The PEP issues 
   the request for initial configuration describing its basic PIB policy 
   capabilities per [POLFRWK.] The policy classes supported by the PEP 
   are indicated with the PRCSupportTable instances. The PEP also 
   describes the policy model capability associated with that interface 
   using an instance of the RSVPPccCapTable.  
        
   The Policy Decision Point determines the appropriate policy 
   information to supply the PEP and responds with a decision install. 
   The PEP confirms the success or failure of the configuration decision 
   with a report.  
        
   The failover operation of the PEP and PDP is described in [3084.]  
         
        
2.3 RSVP Policy Processing Models with local policy criteria   
        
   The policy control processing follows one of three possible models: 
    
   - The first model is the LDP model described in [2753]. The installed 
   policy criteria are used to make a Local Decision. If the local 
   policy approves the reservation request the RSVP message continues 
   its normal processing. The LDP then confirms the decision with the 
   PDP by issuing a request with the LPDP Decision Object. The PDP then 
   issues a final decision, which is enforced by the PEP. The

Internet Draft               RSVP-PCC-PIB               November  2001 
 
 
   outsourcing of the request to the PDP is accomplished via the COPS-
   RSVP connection [2753.] 
        
   - The second model is where the PEP performs policy control by 
   approving a reservation request based on installed policy criteria. 
   In the event that no policy exists for the reservation request, the 
   PEP then outsources the request to the PDP. The PDP then decides to 
   approve or deny the request [2749]. In other words, when a PEP 
   receives a RSVP message, it first queries Local RSVP policy control 
   criteria. If no policy exists for the request the PEP uses COPS-RSVP 
   to query the PDP for outsourcing policy decisions. Note that the PEP 
   may send periodic reports to the PDP informing it of factors that 
   affect decision-making at the PDP e.g. the resource usage etc. In the 
   case that a request is outsourced to a PDP, all pending allocation 
   usage reports should be sent prior to issuing the request. This helps 
   the PDP maintain an accurate picture of resource availability at the 
   PEP while making decisions.  
        
   - The third model is where the PEP relies entirely upon the 
   provisioned policy control criteria for its policy control decision-
   making. If no policies are found for a policy request of a RSVP 
   session, the RSVP session should be rejected. No COPS-RSVP connection 
   between the PEP and PDP is required in this third model when the 
   policy control criteria is local and there is no outsourcing 
   operation.   
    
2.4 Session Classification and Reservation Styles  
        
   The IP filters, frwkIPFilterTable, described in [POLFRWK] are used to 
   associate the authorization (or enforcement) policy with a RSVP 
   session. These filter instances provide the ability to identify the 
   flow 5-tuple: source address, source port, destination address, 
   destination port and protocol id. The RSVP Sender_Template Class, 
   FilterSpec Class and Session Class can be classified using the 
   frwkIPFilterTable. The 5-tuple filter instances may be defined using 
   a wildcard value for the attribute, which accommodates classification 
   policies for the RSVP Fixed Filter, Shared Explicit and Wildcard 
   reservation styles. The frwkIPFilterTable attribute, frwkIPFilterDSCP 
   attribute should contain a wildcard value and must be ignored with 
   regards to the authorization policy. 
    
3 PIB Summary  
     
   The PIB defines the policy control criteria using several types of 
   Policy Rule Classes (PRC). These are the PCC capability policy, the 
   PCC mode policy, filter policy, authorization policies, Intsrv over 
   Diffserv policies, linkage policy and usage policy. The PCC 
   capability specifies the local policy models that the device 
   supports. The PCC mode defines the local policy model that the PDP is 
   directing the PEP to use. The filter policy identifies the flows that 
   have authorization policy. The authorization policy defines the 
   enforcement rules. The Intsrv over Diffserv policies define the 
   interworking rules. The linkage policy associates the filter policy

Internet Draft               RSVP-PCC-PIB               November  2001 
 
 
   with an authorization policy. The usage policy provides feedback to 
   the PDP according to what the PEP has monitored and recorded via an 
   accounting type report.   
       
3.1 Capabilities Table - policyControlCapsTable  
        
   This table provides a single instance describing the RSVP local 
   decision policy models or modes that the PEP is capable of 
   supporting. The three modes have been previously described in section 
   2.3.     
    
3.2 Policy Mode Table û pccModeTable 
   This table contains a single instance that specifies the RSVP local 
   decision policy model that the PDP is directing the PEP to use. This 
   mode must be compatible with the capabilities indicated by the PEP. 
 
3.3 PCC Linkage Table  - pccLinkTable  
        
   This table defines the association between the filter policy and the 
   authorization policy. The PCC Linkage Class references the filter 
   PRID as well as the PRID of the authorization policy class. It links 
   the two instances. (The PRID is the Object Identifier constructed 
   with the PRC and the instance id as the last sub-identifier.) Note 
   that the same filter may have multiple authorization policies. For 
   example a filter may have a Traffic Specifier policy, a Rate 
   Specifier policy and Preemption policy that should be used as policy 
   criteria for determining if the flow is allowed.   
        
   There is future work needed to explore the optimization of the 
   association of filters with authorization policies.    
    
3.4 Authorization Policy Tables   
        
   The Authorization tables contain the enforcement policy classes that 
   determine whether the RSVP reservation is allowed. These policy 
   classes describe the Integrated Services Controlled Load and 
   Guaranteed Services, [2210,2211,2212,2215], the identity 
   authorization user and authorization application policies [2752], and 
   the preemption policies [2751.] The policy classes included in this 
   group are:  
     
3.4.1 Traffic Specifier (Tspec) Policies Table 
    
   Identifies the Integrated Service type and defines the transmission 
   rate of the traffic flow with that Integrated Service type.  
        
3.4.2 RSPEC Limits Table 
    
   Defines the requested service rate from the network related with 
   Guaranteed Services.   
        
3.4.3 Identification Authentication Data Policy Elements Table

Internet Draft               RSVP-PCC-PIB               November  2001 
 
 
   Defines means to securely identify the owner or application making 
   the reservation request.  
        
3.4.4 Priority Preemption Policy Elements Table 
    
   Defines the relative order of importance of the requested flow and 
   permits the preemption of lesser important flows to allow higher 
   priority flows admission.  
    
3.5 Integrated Services over Differentiated Services Policy Tables 
    
   These tables describe the interworking rules for Integrated Services 
   over Diffserv Services. The interworking provisioning rules are based 
   on the model where Intsrv is in the control plane and Diffserv is in 
   the data plane as introduced in [2998] and then further discussed in 
   [EdgeAdmCtl] 
    
3.5.1 Intsrv to Diffserv Interworking Function Table 
    
   This table defines the specific attributes used for the interworking 
   between the RSVP process in the control plane and the Differentiated 
   Services in the data plane. This is used by the Packet Classification 
   and Packet Schedule process for classifying and marking the traffic 
   flow with the appropriate Differentiated Service Code Point and 
   policing the flow. . 
 
3.5.2 Admission Control Virtual Pool Table  
    
   This table defines the virtual pool that is mapped to the 
   Differentiated Services resource allocated to Intsrv traffic. It 
   specifies the Intsrv Service Type, maximum capacity available to the 
   Intsrv admission control process, reservation acceptance status and 
   the associated boundary router logical interface if applicable. 
    
3.5.3 Edge Point Identification Table 
    
   This table is used to identify the receiver domain. The entries 
   define the addresses that are receivers with respect to the router. 
   Admission control performs the upstream resource check when the RSVP 
   Session Object matches one of these address ranges. 
    
3.5 Policy Control Criteria Usage Tables 
    
3.5.1 Policy Control Criteria Allocated Table 
    
   This usage table records the traffic specifications allocated to a 
   successful session and provides feedback to the PDP via the 
   accounting type report. 
    
3.5.2 Policy Control Criteria Session Stats Table 
    
   The usage table records the start time and end time of a session. The 
   start time is based on the successful allocation of the resources for

Internet Draft               RSVP-PCC-PIB               November  2001 
 
 
   a reservation and the end time is associated with the termination of 
   the session and its policy.  
    
3.5.3 Virtual Pool Usage Table 
    
   The virtual pool usage table tracks the current total of resources 
   consumed by the Intsrv flows for a given virtual pool. 
    
    
3.6 Example  
        
   Authorization policies are defined in terms of TRAFFIC SPECIFIER and 
   RSPEC characteristics as well as Integrated Services type i.e. 
   Controlled Load or Guaranteed Services. Additional criteria such as 
   Policy Authentication and Priority Preemption can also be specified.  
     
   An example policy control criteria scenario is as follows. The 
   SenderTemplate and Filterspec are compared against the policy control 
   criteria filters by the PEP. The filter is associated with a set of 
   authorization rules with the linkage policies. For example, policy 
   control criteria could establish authorization for the Gold and 
   Silver VoIP services. The Gold VoIP could be defined as allowing a 
   guaranteed service request, within a traffic specifier and rspec 
   limit, with a high preemption priority and high preemption defending 
   priority. A Silver VoIP could be defined as granting a controlled 
   load service request, within a traffic specifier and rspec limit, 
   with a moderate preemption priority and low preemption defending 
   priority. The PEP records the traffic specifications requested by the 
   session and the session statistics. It reports these back to the PDP 
   on a periodic basis determined by the accounting interval defined in 
   the  feedback linkage policy [FEEDBKFRPIB].

5 Security Considerations  
        
   "..The use of IPSEC between the PDP and the PEP, as described in 
   [2748], provides the necessary protection against security threats. 
   However, even if the network itself is secure, there is no control as 
   to who on the secure network is allowed to "Install/Notify" 
   (read/change/create/delete) the PRIs in this PIB. It is then a 
   customer/user responsibility to ensure that the PEP/PDP giving access 
   to an instance of this PIB, is properly configured to give access to 
   the PRIs only to those principals (users) that have   legitimate 
   rights to indeed "Install" or "Notify" (change/create/ delete) them"
