Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that other
   groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference

Abstract

   The Control and maintenance protocol for providing various Layer 1
   and Layer 2 services over a Packet Switched Network has been
   described in [2]. This document pre-allocates the fixed Pseudo-wire
   identifier , and other fixed protocol values that are to be assigned
   by IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in RFC2434

1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119


2. PW type

   As specified in [1], a Virtual Circuit FEC element contains the PW
   Type field. PW Type value 0 is reserved. PW Type values 1 through 14
   are defined in this document. PW Type values 15 through 63 are to be
   assigned by IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in
   RFC2434. PW Type values 64 through 127 are to be assigned by IANA,
   using the "First Come First Served" policy defined in RFC2434. VC
   Type values 128 through 32767 are vendor-specific, and values in this
   range are not to be assigned by IANA.

   The PW Type is 15 bit quantity containing a value which represents
   the type of PW. Assigned Values are:

           PW type  Description

           0x0001   Frame Relay DLCI
           0x0002   ATM AAL5 SDU VCC transport
           0x0003   ATM transparent cell transport
           0x0004   Ethernet Tagged Mode
           0x0005   Ethernet
           0x0006   HDLC
           0x0007   PPP
           0x8008   CEM [8]

           0x0009   ATM n-to-one VCC cell transport
           0x000A   ATM n-to-one VPC cell transport
           0x000B   IP Layer2 Transport
           0x000C   ATM one-to-one VCC Cell Mode
           0x000D   ATM one-to-one VPC Cell Mode
           0x000E   ATM AAL5 PDU VCC transport


3. Interface Parameters field

   As specified in this document, a PW FEC element contains the
   Interface Parameters field, which is a list of one or more
   parameters, and each parameter is identified by the Parameter ID
   field. Parameter ID value 0 is reserved. Parameter ID values 1
   through 7 are defined in this document.  Parameter ID values 8
   through 63 are to be assigned by IANA using the "IETF Consensus"
   policy defined in RFC2434. Parameter ID values 64 through 127 are to
   be assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served" policy
   defined in RFC2434. Parameter ID values 128 through 255 are vendor-
   specific, and values in this range are not to be assigned by IANA.

   The interface parameter ID is assigned as follows:
   Parameter   ID Length    Description

       0x01         4       Interface MTU in octets.
       0x02         4       Maximum Number of concatenated ATM cells.
       0x03   up to 82      Optional Interface Description string.
       0x04         4       CEP [8] Payload Bytes.
       0x05         2       CEP options.
       0x06         2       Requested VLAN ID
       0x07         4       CEP/TDM bit-rate


4. Status codes

   RFC 3036 has a range of Status Code values which are assigned by IANA
   on a First Come, First Served basis. These are in the range
   0x20000000-0x3effffff. To meet the protocol requirements of [1], the
   following new status codes are defined:

           0x20000001 "Illegal C-Bit"
           0x20000002 "Wrong C-Bit"
           0x20000003 "Incompatible bit-rate"

5. Security Considerations

   This document specifies only fixed identifiers, and not the protocols
   used to carry the encapsulated packets across the network.  Each such
   protocol may have its own set of security issues, but those issues
   are not affected by the identifiers specified herein.


6. Intellectual Property Disclaimer

   This document is being submitted for use in IETF standards
   discussions.
