1. Introduction 

   This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label 
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched 
   optical networks (WSON).  In particular, extensions are given to 
   characterize optical signal types via traffic parameters, control a 
   distributed wavelength assignment process, and convey information 
   necessary for that process in a compact manner. These extensions 
   build on previous work for the control of G.709 based networks.

   CWDM: Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing. 

   DWDM: Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing. 

   FOADM: Fixed Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer. 

   ROADM: Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer. A reduced port 
   count wavelength selective switching element featuring ingress and 
   egress line side ports as well as add/drop side ports. 

   RWA: Routing and Wavelength Assignment. 

   Wavelength Conversion/Converters: The process of converting an 
   information bearing optical signal centered at a given wavelength to 
   one with "equivalent" content centered at a different wavelength. 
   Wavelength conversion can be implemented via an optical-electronic-

   WDM: Wavelength Division Multiplexing. 

   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON): WDM based optical 
   networks in which switching is performed selectively based on the 
   center wavelength of an optical signal. 

3. WSON Signal Types, Forward Error Correction, and Rates 

   Although WSONs are fairly transparent to the signals they carry, to 
   ensure compatibility amongst various networks devices and end systems 
   it can be important to include key lightpath characteristics as 
   traffic parameters in signaling [WSON-Frame].  

3.1. Traffic Parameters for WSON signals 

   As in [RFC4606] and [RFC4328] the following traffic parameters would 
   become the contents for the RSVP SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects. 
   The WSON traffic parameters SHOULD be defined as follows:

   Modulation (Mod) Types: 

   We have potentially the following: 

     Value     Type 
     -----     ---- 
       0        Unspecified or Unknown 
       1        NRZ 
       2        RZ 
    
    
   Modulation Parameters(Mod Params):  
   RZ 0 - 33%, 1 -  50%, 2 - 67% duty cycles 
    
   See [G.959.1] and [Winzer06]. 
    
   These are specific to the modulation type employed and may or may not 
   be used.  For example NRZ modulation typically doesn't have extra 
   parameters, while RZ modulation has a duty cycle parameter. 
    
    
   Bitrate/Analog Bandwidth: 
   For digital signals this is the bit rate given as a 32 bit IEEE 
   floating point number. 
    
   For analog signals or when modulation type is given as 0 
   (unspecified), this is the bandwidth of the signal around the center 
   frequency (c/lambda) and not the bit/byte rate. This is given as a 32 
   bit IEEE floating point number that represents the bandwidth in 
   Hertz. The exact definition of bandwidth, e.g., 3dB power bandwidth, 
   etc. is TBD and may be network specific.

4. Distributed Wavelength Assignment 

   As indicated in the WSON framework document [WSON-Frame] that the use 
   of a signaling protocol to perform distributed wavelength assignment 
   may be highly desirable.  

4.1. Wavelength Sets 

   The LABEL_SET mechanism of [RFC3471] and [RFC3473] can be used to 
   describe the current set of available labels. However, the size of 
   the label set object is of potential concern in WSON signaling since 
   the number of channels in commercial WDM systems continues to grow. 
   In the following, a more compact representation of wavelength label 
   sets is given.  

   The starting point for our label sets is the lambda label format 
   defined in [Otani] and enhance on the CCAMP mailing list shown below: 

      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |Grid |  C.S. |S|    Reserved   |               n               | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   Where 

   Grid is used to indicate which ITU-T grid specification is being 
   used. 

   C.S. = Channel spacing used in a DWDM system, i.e., with a ITU-T 
   G.694.1 grid. 

   S = sign of the offset from the center frequency of 193.1THz for the 
   ITU-T 6.694.1 grid. 

   n = Used to specify the frequency as 193.1THz +/- n*(channel spacing) 
   where the + or - is chosen based on the sign (S) bit. 

   The general format for a wavelength set is given below. This format 
   uses the Action concept from [RFC3471] with an additional Action to 
   define a "bit map" type of label set. Note that the second 32 bit 
   field is a lambda label in the previously defined format. This 
   provides important information on the WDM grid type and channel 
   spacing that will be used in the more compact encodings.

   4.1.1. Inclusive/Exclusive Wavelength Lists 

   In the case of the inclusive/exclusive lists the wavelength set 
   format is given by: 

      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     | Action=0 or 1 | Reserved      |    Num Wavelengths            | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |Grid |  C.S. |S|    Reserved   |    n  for lowest frequency    | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |    n2                         |          n3 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |                            ...                                | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |    nm                         |                               | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   Where Num Wavelengths tells us the number of wavelength in this 
   inclusive or exclusive list this does not include the initial 
   wavelength in the list hence if the number of wavelengths is odd then 
   zero padding of the last half word is required.

   This format for the wavelength set results in over a 50% reduction in 
   the size wavelength set object and that this object can get 
   significantly larger as the number of WDM channels grows. 

   4.1.2. Inclusive/Exclusive Wavelength Ranges 

   In the case of inclusive/exclusive ranges the wavelength set format 
   is given by: 

      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     | Action=2 or 3 | Reserved      |    Num Wavelengths            |   
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |Grid |  C.S. |S|    Reserved   |    n  for lowest frequency    | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   In this case Num Wavelengths specifies the number of wavelengths in 
   the range starting at the given wavelength and incrementing the Num 
   Wavelengths number of channel spacing up in frequency (regardless of 
   the value of the sign bit). This encoding results in over a 50% space 
   saving over the RFC3471 label set. However since the label set object 
   in this case was quite compact already this only important when 
   multiple ranges are used to specify a complete wavelength set. 

   4.1.3. Bitmap Wavelength Set 

   In the case of Action = the bitmap the wavelength set format is given 
   by: 

      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     | Action = 4    | Reserved      |    Num Wavelengths            | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |Grid |  C.S. |S|    Reserved   |    n  for lowest frequency    | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |    Bit Map Word #1  (Lowest frequency channels)            | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |                ...                                            | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |    Bit Map Word #N  (Highest frequency channels)              | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   Where Num Wavelengths in this case tells us the number of wavelengths 
   represented by the bit map which is required to be ceiling[(Num 
   Wavelengths)/32]. Each bit in the bit map represents a particular 
     

   Bernstein and Lee Expires August 21, 2008 [Page 7]

   frequency with a value of 1/0 indicating the frequency is 
   available/not-available. Bit position zero represents the lowest 
   frequency, while each succeeding bit position represents the next 
   frequency a channel spacing (C.S.) above the previous. 

   Example: 

   A 40 channel C-Band DWDM system with 100GHz spacing with lowest 
   frequency 192.0THz (1561.4nm) and highest frequency 195.9THz 
   (1530.3nm). These frequencies correspond to n = -11, and n = 28 
   respectively. Now suppose the following channels are available: 

            Frequency(THz)    n Value     bit map position 
         -------------------------------------------------- 
            192.0             -11         0 
            192.5             -6          5 
            193.1             0           11 
            193.9             8           19 
            194.0             9           20 
            195.2             21          32 
            195.8             27          38 
    

   With the Grid value set to indicate an ITU-T G.694.1 DWDM grid, C.S. 
   set to indicate 100GHz, and with S (sign) set to indicate negative 
   this lambda bit map set would then be encoded as follows: 

 

      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     | Action = 4    | Reserved      |    Num Wavelengths = 40       | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |Grid |  C.S. |S|    Reserved   | n  for lowest frequency = 11  | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0| 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0|   Not used in 40 Channel system (all zeros)   |           
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   Note that the consistent use of a bit map wavelength set allows for 
   simple and efficient bit/byte operations to determine available 
   wavelengths along a path rather than processing lists of wavelength 
   labels.

4.2. Wavelength Assignment Method Selection 

   As discussed in [HZang00] a number of different wavelength assignment 
   algorithms maybe employed. In addition as discussed in [WSON-Frame] 
   the wavelength assignment can be either for a unidirectional 
   lightpath or for a bidirectional lightpath constrained to use the 
   same lambda in both directions. A simple TLV could be used to 
   indication wavelength assignment directionality and wavelength 
   assignment method. This would be placed in an LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES 
   object per [RFC4420]. The use of a TLV in the LSP required attributes 
   object was pointed out in [Xu]. 

   Directionality: 0 unidirectional, 1 bidirectional 

   Wavelength Assignment Method: 0 unspecified (any), 1 First-Fit, 2 
   Random, 3 Least-Loaded (multi-fiber).  Others TBD. 

    

       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

4.3. Supplemental Information for Wavelength Assignment 

   Distributed wavelength assignment makes extensive use of the label 
   set object/TLV of [RFC3471]. Some higher performance algorithms 
   suitable for multi-fiber networks such as Least-Loaded assignment 
   require supplemental information concerning the potential lambdas to 
   be used. An ordered set of TLVs in correspondence with the group of 
   one or more label set TLVs can be used to convey this information in 
   the form of a general wavelength "acceptability" metric. 

   Note that the label set syntax of [RFC3471] allows group of 
   wavelengths into ranges. For the purpose of supplementing this 
   information with wavelength count only those wavelengths with the

   The general format for supplemental wavelength selection information 
   could be as follows:

      Info Type: 8 bits 

         0 - Single Value 

   The enclosed single value for the wavelength metric is given to all 
   wavelengths in the corresponding wavelength set. 

         1 - List 

   The enclosed list gets applied in a one-to-one fashion to each 
   wavelength in the corresponding wavelength set. An error occurs if 
   the number of metrics in this list and the number of wavelengths in 
   the wavelength set is not equal. 

   Metric Size:  

   Indicates the size of the wavelength metric information as follows 

         0 - 8 bits 

         1 - 16 bits 

         2 - 32 bits 

   Number 0f Metrics: 24 bits 

   Wavelength Metric: (1, 2, or 4 octets) 

         The wavelength metric represents in some fashion the 
   desirability or lack thereof to use this wavelength over another 
   available wavelength. Different wavelength assignment algorithms may 
   use this information differently.

4.4. Least-Loaded Wavelength Assignment (informational) 

   The Least-Loaded wavelength assignment algorithm [HZang00] can be 
   implemented in a distributed fashion via signaling with the addition 
   of channel count metric information. Least-loaded assignment applies 
   to multi-fiber links hence the supplemental information pertains to 
   the number of available channels at a particular wavelength. Hence 
   the subchannel metric of section 4.3. would simple be the channel 
   count of a particular wavelength. 

   The per node processing to implement the least-loaded assignment 
   algorithm consists of receiving the label set and supplementary 
   information TLVs (wavelengths and their channel counts) and taking 
   the minimum of the received channel counts and the egress channel 
   counts on a per wavelength basis. Where wavelengths with zero 
   available channels will be discarded from the label set.  The 
   resulting channel counts and wavelength set will then be forwarded on 
   to the next node for processing. For more details on least loaded 
   wavelength assignment see [WSON-Frame] and [HZang00]. 

   Example: Wavelength set and wavelength channel count metric for the 
   previous 40 Channel DWDM system. Suppose that in the previous 40 
   channel system was also a multi-fiber system and that the wavelengths 
   (frequencies) have the following number of channels (this is a multi-
   fiber system) available: 

            Frequency(THz)    channels available 
         ----------------------------------------- 
            192.0             3 
            192.5             2 
            193.1             1 
            193.9             2 
            194.0             2 
            195.2             1 
            195.8             1 
    

   Then the wavelength metric list corresponding to the wavelength set 
   of the example in section 4.1.3. could be given by:

5. Security Considerations 

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models 
   within GMPLS and associated protocols. That is the OSPF-TE, RSVP-TE, 
   and PCEP security models could be operated unchanged.  
    
   However satisfying the requirements for RWA using the existing 
   protocols may significantly affect the loading of those protocols. 
   This makes the operation of the network more vulnerable to denial of 
   service attacks. Therefore additional care maybe required to ensure 
   that the protocols are secure in the WSON environment.  
    
   Furthermore the additional information distributed in order to 
   address the RWA problem represents a disclosure of network 
   capabilities that an operator may wish to keep private. Consideration 
   should be given to securing this information.  

6. IANA Considerations 

   TBD. Once finalized in our approach we will need identifiers for such 
   things and modulation types, modulation parameters, wavelength 
   assignment methods, etc...
