Internet-Draft           OMA BCAST MIKEY GenExt             October 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) protocol specification (RFC
   3830 [3]) defines a General Extension payload to allow possible
   extensions to MIKEY without having to allocate a new payload type.
   The General Extension payload can be used in any MIKEY message and is
   part of the authenticated/signed data part.  There is an 8-bit type
   field in that payload.  The type code assignment is IANA-managed, and
   RFC 3830 requires IETF consensus for assignments from the public
   range of 0-240.

   The Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA) Broadcast (BCAST) group's Service
   and Content Protection specification [2] specifies the use of a
   short- term key message (STKM), a long-term key message (LTKM), a
   LTKM reporting message, as well as a parental control message that
   carry attributes related to Service and Content protection.  Note
   that any keys associated with the attributes, such as the Parental
   Control Pincode if present, are part of the MIKEY KEMAC payload.

   This document specifies the use of the General Extension payload of
   MIKEY to carry the messages mentioned above, as well as protection of
   the credentials using mechanisms supported by MIKEY with
   modifications in [3].

   RFC 3830 [3], the MIKEY General Extension payload defined in RFC 4563
   [4], and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)'s Multimedia
   Broadcast/ Multicast Service (MBMS) document [5] specify the
   transport of MIKEY messages via unicast or broadcast and the OMA
   specifications use either for transport of MIKEY messages.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6].

   OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension: We refer to the General Extension
   type -- 5 -- as the OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension.


3.  MIKEY General Extension for OMA BCAST Usage

   Section 6.1 of RFC 3830 [3] specifies the first three fields of the
   General Extension Payload and defines a variable length Data field.

   The contents of the OMA BCAST payload field are defined in Section 6
   of the OMA BCAST Service and Content Protection specification [2].


4.  Interoperability considerations

   This document specifies the use of MIKEY General Extension Payload
   Type 5 and four subtype values (1, 2, TBD1 and TBD2), one each for
   OMA BCAST Service and Content protection's STKM and LTKM payloads.
   Interoperability Considerations span several standards bodies, with
   OMA BCAST 1.0 enabler compliance being the key aspect; as such it is
   up to the OMA test planning to verify the interoperability and
   compliance of OMA BCAST 1.0 implementations.  This payload type
   assignment does not change MIKEY beyond RFC 3830 [3] and RFC 4563
   [4].


5.  Security Considerations

   According to RFC 3830 [3], the general extension payload can be used
   in any MIKEY message and is part of the authenticated/signed data
   part.  The parameters proposed to be included in the OMA BCAST MIKEY
   General Extension payload (listed in Section 3) need only to be
   integrity protected, which is already allowed by the MIKEY
   specification.  The OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Payload SHALL
   be integrity protected.  Furthermore, keys or any parameters that
   require confidentiality MUST NOT be included in the General Extension
   Payload.  If Keys or other confidential data are to be transported
   via the General Extension Payload, such data MUST be encrypted and
   encapsulated independently.  Finally, note that MIKEY already
   provides replay protection and that protection covers also the
   General Extension Payload.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated an OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Type --5--
   from the "General Extensions payload name space" in the IANA registry
   at http://www.iana.org/assignments/mikey-payloads for use by OMA
   BCAST as requested by RFC 4909 [1].  Furthermore, IANA has created a
   name space for the OMA BCAST payload subtype values defined in [1]
   and has assigned the following subtype values from this name space:
   LTKM (1), STKM (2).

   IANA is requested to allocate two new subtypes from the OMA BCAST
   payload subtype name space, referenced above, in the IANA registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mikey-payloads.

Internet-Draft           OMA BCAST MIKEY GenExt             October 2008


   The requested subtypes are as follows:

      Subtype Name: LTKM Reporting

      Value: TBD1

      Suggested value: 3

   and

      Subtype Name: Parental Control

      Value: TBD2

      Suggested value: 4

   Note to Editor: Please replace all TBD1 and TBD2 in this
   specification with the values assigned by IANA.


7.  Changes since RFC 4909

   OMA BCAST Service and Content Protection specification [2] contains
   messages that were created since RFC 4909 was written.  This document
   only adds the necessary assignments to support these new messages.
   No modifications are made on values assigned by RFC 4909 [1].


8.  Acknowledgments

   Many thanks to the authors of RFC 4909 [1] for allowing to update
   their RFC.
