Abstract

   The behaviour that must be followed when an route distinguisher (RD)
   of value zero is received is not clearly defined in rfc4364. This
   document clarifies the use of an RD with a value of zero in the
   context defined in rfc 4364.

1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2. Introduction

   This document refines the Route Distinguisher semantics detailed in
   [RFC4364]. The Route Distinguisher consist of an 8-byte value whose
   encoding is detailed in [RFC4364]. The Route Distinguisher is used in
   conjunction with VPN prefixes and VPN nexthops in VPN networks to
   solely allow one to create distinct routes to a common IPv4 address
   prefix.


3. RFC4364 definitions

   Currently in [RFC4364] section 4.3.2, the RD is used with a value of
   0 in the next hop field of the BGP NLRI. This is a special case that
   is allowed by the design.  In section 4.2 of [RFC4364], the enconding
   of the RD for type 0 is defines as a type field , and a value field.
   If the type field is 0, then the value field in interpreted as
   containing an autonomous system number (ASN), and a assigned Number
   subfield. The ASN cannot contain 0 as it is a reserved ASN number.

3.1.  Usage of RD value of zero

   Whenever the RD is used within the VPN nexthop field of the BGP NLRI,
   the RD is used with the value of 0. However whenever the RD is used
   with VPN prefix field of the BGP NLRI , the Route Distinguisher MUST
   never be used with the value of 0. Hence, VPN routes received with
   the Route Distinguisher value of 0 MUST be discarded with an
   appropriate error.
