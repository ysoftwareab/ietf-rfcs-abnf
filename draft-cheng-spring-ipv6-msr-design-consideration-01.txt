1.  Introduction

   Multicast could provide efficient P2MP service without bandwidth
   waste.  The increasing amount of live video traffic in the network
   bring new requirements for multicast solutions.  Traditional
   multicast solutions request multicast tree-building on control plane

   and maintaining end-to-end tree state per flow, which impacts router
   state capacity and network convergence time.

   There has been a lot of work in IETF to simplify service deployment,
   in which Source Routing is a very important technology.  Source
   routing is able to reduce the state of intermediate nodes and
   indicate unicast forwarding in the ingress nodes, which could
   simplify unicast deployment.  Source routing requires sufficient
   flexibility on the forwarding plane and IPv6 has the advantage with
   good scalability.  Particularly, based on the IPv6 data plane, SRv6
   could be deployed not only in a controlled domain where routers and
   hosts are running SRv6 cooperatively.

   With the same stateless design, there is another work called Bit
   Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [RFC8279] introduced in IETF.  The
   BIER solution is different than the traditional multicast and the
   benefits have been understood by the community.  However, the BIER
   architecture is designed to be Layer-2.6 independent layer, and aims
   to be used in a domain comprised of routers only, where the Ingress
   router encapsulate a received multicast packet with BIER header and
   traverse through the domain, wherein the Egress router decapsluate
   the multicast packet from the BIER encapsulation and forward the
   multicast packet further as traditional multicast does.

   With the deployment of SRv6, there is arising requirements to build
   solutions where hosts and routers are cooperatively deployed in a
   controlled domain, and stateless multicast solution start from hosts.
   Therefore, it is important to also have a layer-3 stateless multicast
   solution based on IPv6 data plane, which we called multicast source
   routing (MSR6).

   This document discusses the design consideration of IPv6 multicast
   source routing (MSR6) solution.  It combines the SRv6 Network
   programming concept and BIER concept to build a new Layer-3 stateless
   multicast solution.

   In the reference topology illustrated in Figure 1, it is assumed:

   o  The MSR6 domain is comprised by node A, B, C, D, E, F and G.

   o  Node A is root node.  Node B and C are transit nodes.  Node D, E,
      F and G are leaf nodes.

   o  The root and leaf nodes can be hosts or routers.

   o  The transit nodes are routers functioning the MSR6 routing and
      forwarding procedures.

4.  Deployment Modes

4.1.  Conventional Multicast Deployment

   The first deployment mode is dipicted in below figure.

            +--------------+

                 | A |------------------
                 +---+               |
                /     \              |
             +---+   +---+           |
             | B |   | C |       MSR6 domain
             +---+   +---+           |
           /   |       |   \         |
      +---+  +---+   +---+ +---+     |

      +------------------------+
      |     Client Network     |
      +------------------------+

   In this case, MSR6 domain is comprised of routers only.  The Ingress
   router A encapsulates a multicast packet received from client Network
   with a tunnel header and the encapsulated packet will traverse
   through the domain, wherein the Egress router decapsluate the
   multicast packet from the BIER encapsulation and forward the
   multicast packet further to the client network.  This is similar to
   the BIER architecture with a difference that the the MSR6 uses IPv6
   based dataplane.

   The second deployment mode is dipicted in below figure.

      +---+  +---+   +---+ +---+

   In this case, MSR6 domain is comprised of hosts and routers, where
   node A/D/E/F/G are hosts which is usually a server instead of the

   user-equipment(UE).  MSR6 packet is originated at Server A, and
   destined to Server D, E, F and G.

4.3.  Multicast Overlay Network

   In the Multicast Overlay Network, there is a multicast proxy node in
   each site, and the contents allocation from one site to serveral
   sites could be implemented by the multicast proxy nodes.

    |   | B |   |         +-|---+ C +---|-+
     \  +---+  /          |  \  +---+  /  |
       -Site b-           |    -Site c-   |
                       ---|---         ---|---
                     /  +-+-+  \     /  +-+-+  \
                    |   | D |   |   |   + E +   |
                     \  +---+  /     \  +---+  /
                       -Site d-        -Site e-


   An example of the Multicast Overlay Network could be as follows:

   o  Each client of the sites collect the information of the multicast
      proxy nodes and their connection relationship;

   o  Several clients, from site b,d,e, request the same contents in one
      client X of site a at the same time;

   o  Client X generates a P2MP path from Site a to site b,d,e and the
      path is encoded into an MRH A;

   o  Client X sends out the requested contents by an IPv6 packet with
      MRH A, indicating the P2MP path explicitely;

   o  The packet is transported to the clients in site b,d,e through
      proxy A in site a and Proxy C in site c;

5.  Design Consideration

   Firstly, MSR6 needs to support the basic multicast functionalities,
   including:

   o  P2MP Forwarding: replicate and forward multicast packet to the
      next replication nodes;

   o  Multicast Flow Overlay: multicast service, such as MVPN

   o  P2MP OAM functions: Ping/Traceroute/BFD

   In addition to this, it is necessary for MSR6 to meet the need of
   high quality service with high reliability, including:

   o  Traffic Engineering: explicit path specification to satisfy
      different kinds of requirements

   o  FRR

   o  E2E Protection

   o  Advanced network measurement functions, including: performance
      measurement and In-situ Flow Information Telemetry, which is the
      basis for traffic engineering and high quality transport service.

   The IPv6 multicast source routing should take use of the advantages
   of source routing to reduce the state of the network as much as
   possible.  That is, it should satisfy the above requirements with
   high scalability.

   However, MSR6 is not about starting from scratch.  The existing IETF
   work should be reused as much as possible:

   o  BIER [RFC8279] and [RFC8296]

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) defined in [RFC8279] is an
   architecture providing optimal multicast forwarding without requiring
   intermediate routers to maintain any per-flow state by using a
   multicast-specific BIER header.  BIER use bitstring in the BIER
   header to indicate leaf nodes which gives an efficient solution for
   stateless multicast solution. flow without the requirement of Traffic
   Engineering.

   o  SRv6([RFC8986])

   SRv6 has advantages in indicating explicit paths, which brings
   convenience for unicast TE and FRR.  MSR6 TE should refer to the



Cheng, et al.            Expires April 28, 2022                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Design Consideration of MSR6          October 2021


   experience of SRv6.  In addition, SRv6 provides flexible path
   programming capability with the definition of different type of
   segments.  MSR6 could make use the of existing segments in the design
   of TE/FRR . For example, path segment
   ([I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-path-segment]) could help to enhance the
   performance measurement capability.  In the meantime, SRv6
   compression ([I-D.srcompdt-spring-compression-requirement]) is under
   discussion to reduce encapsulation overhead, which could also be
   reused by MSR6.

   o  The existing and ongoing IPv6 extensions

   1) Existing functionalities including fragmentation and security

   Multicast packets need to be fragmented and secured as they pass
   through the IPv6 network.  This can be done using IPv6 Fragmentation
   and ESP(Encapsulating Security Payload) defined in [RFC8200].  Work
   about Path MTU [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-path-mtu] which supports
   fragmentation, is also under discussion.  All these existing work
   should be reused in the MSR6.

   2) New network functionalities based on the ongoing IPv6 Extensions,
   including Network Slicing, Deterministic Networking(DetNet),
   IOAM.etc.

   Network slicing ([I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices]) and DetNet
   ([RFC8655]) are being introduced to satisfy the quality service
   requirements of critical services.  IOAM ([I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data])
   is also introduced to implement in-situ network measurement.  IPv6
   data plane is being used to support network slicing
   ([I-D.li-6man-e2e-ietf-network-slicing] and
   [I-D.dong-6man-enhanced-vpn-vtn-id]), Detnet
   ([I-D.geng-spring-srv6-for-detnet] and
   [I-D.geng-spring-sr-redundancy-protection]), IOAM
   ([I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]), etc.  Multicast service can also benefit
   from these new network functionalities to improve quality of service.
   MSR6 could reuse the ongoing work based on IPv6 extensions to
   implement the functionalities for multicast services.

   3) Future possible work based on IPv6 extensions, including
   Application Aware Network (APN)

   APN ([I-D.li-apn-framework]) is used to provide more granular
   services, which can use IPv6 extension header to carry APN
   information for the purpose of steering traffic, etc.  MSR6 can
   combine with APN to map the traffic to different Network-based
   multicast services/functionalities according to the APN information
   in the IPv6 data plane.

Internet-Draft        Design Consideration of MSR6          October 2021


   4) MSR6 is also supposed to be started at the Host based on IPv6

   In [RFC8754], it is supposed that a host can originate the IPv6
   source routing packet.  MSR6 should take use of the native IPv6
   design and support originating the IPv6 packet by the host.

6.  Requirements

   This section describes the overall requirements which need to be
   fulfilled by MSR6.

6.1.  Path Programming

   When the multicast root and leafs are determined, the multicast
   service may be forwarded along different multicast paths/trees.  Each
   multicast tree has different performance attribute, such as
   bandwidth, delay, etc.  For instance, tree A is the shortest path
   from root 1 to leaf 1-100, which has the lowest delay, while the
   other tree B from the same root to same leafs can provide more
   bandwidth than tree A.  Therefore, the delay-sensitive traffic like
   cloud AR/VR traffic SHOULD be forwarded along with tree A, and the
   traffic that is delay-insensitive but requiring large bandwidth like
   8k HD Video be forwarded along with tree B.

   In order to meet the different SLA requirements, IPv6-based MSR6 MUST
   support path programming.

6.2.  Resource Assurance

   Network slicing is another method to provide SLA differentiated
   services, because it is able to provide separate and independent
   logical network over the physical network infrastructure.  Each
   Network Slicing has its own allocated resource, which can also meet
   the specific SLA requirements for different multicast service.  Or an
   independent network slice could be allocated to all the multicast
   service, which could provide multicast service with better transport
   performance than normal unicast service.

   So in order to provide SLA guaranteed services, MSR6 SHOULD support
   network slicing.

6.3.  Deterministic Delay

   Some delay-sensitive multicast traffic may have the strict
   requirements for network delay, especailly in some scenario of IoT or
   enterprise.  Deterministic Networking (DetNet) defined in [RFC8655]
   could provide service with E2E latency upper bound for both unicast
   and multicast.  Therefore, MSR6 shoud support DetNet.

Internet-Draft        Design Consideration of MSR6          October 2021


6.4.  Performance Measurement

   Many OAM mechanisms are used to support network operation.
   Performance Measurement (PM) is one of the most important part of
   OAM.  With PM, the real-time QoS of the forwarding path, like delay,
   packet loss ratio and throughput, can be measured.

   PM can be implemented in one of three ways: active, passive, or
   hybrid defined in [RFC7799], differing in whether OAM packets need to
   be proactively sent.

   On-path telemetry, defined in [I-D.song-opsawg-ifit-framework] , is
   an hybrid mode OAM/PM mechanism, which provides better accuracy than
   active PM.

   Some multicast scenarios have strong requirement for PM, therefore
   on-path Performance Measurement SHOULD be supported in MSR6.

6.5.  Reliability

   In scenarios where multicast is used to carry video streams, packet
   loss can lead to impaired video quality.  So high reliability is
   required in these scenarios.  E2E protection and local protection of
   node and links MUST be supported in MSR6.  Furthermore, root and leaf
   node protection SHOULD be supported.

6.6.  Forwarding Efficiency

   Multicast is used for saving bandwidth cost with the capability of
   replication and forwarding.

   Path Maximum Transmission Unit indicates the maximum size of a packet
   that it can be forwarded along a path.  Setting an appropriate PMTU
   for packets can avoid fragmentation or dropping, so that the
   forwarding efficiency can be raised.

   Also, the overhead of packets MUST be added very carefully since it
   affects the forwarding efficiency directly.  For example, when many
   SIDs are inserted in an SRv6 packet, the overhead of the SID list is
   too large.

   Therefore, the MSR6 MUST support PMTU probing and configuration.  In
   addition, it SHOULD support compression when it is necessary.

Internet-Draft        Design Consideration of MSR6          October 2021


7.  Use Cases

7.1.  MVPN or GTM service

   MVPN(multicast virtual private network, RFC6513) and GTM(Global
   Table Multicast, RFC7716) are usual cases for conventional deployment
   mode, where MSR6 acts as P-tunnel of c-multicast packets.

7.2.  File Delivery

   File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE, RFC6726) is a
   common use case for multicast.  The traditional multicast or MSR6
   conventional deployment mode are both valid candidates for FLUTE,
   where the application in host could Join a multicast Group address,
   and receive multicast packet carrying file content.

   In some other cases, File delivery to multiple hosts efficiently (for
   example, video editing) may need within a data center network, but
   the data center may not support underlay multicast routing of any
   form in the Fabric infrastructure.  In such cases, Host-initialized
   MSR6 could be used as figure dipcted below.  Server A originates a
   MSR6 packet carrying file content bytes and sends to B or C.  Router
   B or C receives the MSR6 packet and replicate to Server D/E/F/G.
   Server D/E/F/G receives the MSR6 packet and gets the file content
   bytes within it.  Router B or C acts as overlay Multicast Service
   Node [RFC8293] in this case.

              +---------+
              |Server A | ------------------
              +---------+                |

7.3.  WebRTC Relaying

   Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) is now an official World Wide
   Web Consortium (W3C) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
   standard.  In supporting of multiparty conference, WebRTC Gateway is
   usually deployed to switch audio and video packets between multiple
   clients.  The figure dipects the case, where C1 to C7 are WebRTC
   client (e.g., browser), and Server A, D, E, F and G are WebRTC
   gateways.  Within the MSR6 doamin, MSR6 is used in both hosts and
   routers.
