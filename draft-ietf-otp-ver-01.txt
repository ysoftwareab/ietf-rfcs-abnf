STATUS OF THIS MEMO
 
  This document is an Internet Draft. Internet Drafts are working
  documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its Areas
  and Working Groups. Note that other groups may also distribute
  working documents as Internet Drafts.
 
  Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
  months. Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
  documents at any time. It is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts
  as reference material or to cite them other than as a "working
  draft" or "work in progress."

1.0 ABSTRACT

This document provides a series of inputs and correct outputs for all
three of the defined OTP cryptographic hashes, specifically MD4, MD5,
and SHA1.  This document is intended to be used by developers for
interoperability checks when creating generators or servers.  Output
is provided in both hexadecimal notation and the six word encoding
documented in Appendix C.

2.0  GENERAL CHECKS

Note that the output given for these checks is not intended to be
taken literally, but describes the type of action that should be taken.

2.1 Pass Phrase Length

 Input: 
   Pass Phrase: Too_short
   Seed: iamvalid
   Count: 99
   Hash: ANY
 Output:
   ERROR:  Pass Phrase too short

 Input:
   Pass Phrase:
     1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234
   Seed: iamvalid
   Count: 99
   Hash: ANY
 Output:
   WARNING: Pass Phrase longer than the recommended maximum length of 63

2.2  Seed Values

 Input:
   Pass Phrase:  A_Valid_Pass_Phrase
   Seed: Length_Okay
   Count: 99
   Hash: ANY
 Output:
   ERROR: Seed must be purely alphanumeric

 Input:
   Pass Phrase:  A_Valid_Pass_Phrase
   Seed: LengthOfSeventeen
   Count: 99
   Hash: ANY
 Output:
   ERROR: Seed must be between 1 and 16 characters in length

 Input:
   Pass Phrase:  A_Valid_Pass_Phrase
   Seed: A Seed
   Count: 99
   Hash: ANY
 Output:
   ERROR: Seed must not contain any spaces

2.3 Parity Calculations

 Input:
   Pass Phrase: A_Valid_Pass_Phrase
   Seed: AValidSeed
   Count: 99
   Hash: MD5
 Output:
   Hex: 85c43ee03857765b
   Six Word(CORRECT):          FOWL KID MASH DEAD DUAL OAF 
   Six Word(INCORRECT PARITY): FOWL KID MASH DEAD DUAL NUT 
   Six Word(INCORRECT PARITY): FOWL KID MASH DEAD DUAL O 
   Six Word(INCORRECT PARITY): FOWL KID MASH DEAD DUAL OAK

6.0 Security Considerations

The whole concept of OTP's are part of a security system, however this
document does not deal with any security issues.
