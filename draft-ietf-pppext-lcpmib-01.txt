          1.  Abstract

          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
          describes managed objects used for managing the Link Control
          Protocol and Link Quality Monitoring on subnetwork interfaces
          that use the family of Point-to-Point Protocols[8, 9, 10, 11,
          & 12].

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          2.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
          three components.  They are:

               RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
               describing and naming objects for the purpose of
               management.  RFC 1212 defines a more concise description
               mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

               RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed
               objects for the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213,
               defines MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I based on
               implementation experience and new operational
               requirements.

               RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
               network access to managed objects.

          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          3.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [3] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
          refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [1]
          purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
          These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.

          The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1
          [4], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the
          SNMP.


          3.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 5 contains the specification of all object types
          contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined
          using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the
          extensions specified in [5,6].

          Internet Draft           PPP/LCP MIB                 July 1992


          4.  Overview

          4.1.  Object Selection Criteria

          To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering
          practice, an explicit attempt was made to keep this MIB as
          simple as possible.  This was accomplished by applying the
          following criteria to objects proposed for inclusion:

          (1)  Require objects be essential for either fault or
               configuration management.  In particular, objects for
               which the sole purpose was to debug implementations were
               explicitly excluded from the MIB.

          (2)  Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.

          (3)  Limit the total number of objects.

          (4)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in
               this or other MIBs.


          4.2.  Structure of the PPP

          This section describes the basic model of PPP used in
          developing the PPP MIB. This information should be useful to
          the implementor in understanding some of the basic design
          decisions of the MIB.

          The PPP is not one single protocol but a large family of
          protocols.  Each of these is, in itself, a fairly complex
          protocol.  The PPP protocols may be divided into three rough
          categories:

          Control Protocols
               The Control Protocols are used to control the operation
               of the PPP. The Control Protocols include the Link
               Control Protocol (LCP), the Password Authentication
               Protocol (PAP), the Link Quality Report (LQR), and the
               Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP).

          Network Protocols
               The Network Protocols are used to move the network
               traffic over the PPP interface.  A Network Protocol

          Internet Draft           PPP/LCP MIB                 July 1992


               encapsulates the datagrams of a specific higher-layer
               protocol that is using the PPP as a data link.  Note that
               within the context of PPP, the term "Network Protocol"
               does not imply an OSI Layer-3 protocol; for instance,
               there is a Bridging network protocol.

          Network Control Protocols (NCPs)
               The NCPs are used to control the operation of the Network
               Protocols. Generally, each Network Protocol has its own
               Network Control Protocol; thus, the IP Network Protocol
               has its IP Control Protocol, the Bridging Network
               Protocol has its Bridging Network Control Protocol and so
               on.

          This document specifies the objects used in managing one of
          these protocols, namely the Link Control Protocol and Link
          Quality Monitoring Protocol.


          4.3.  MIB Groups

          Objects in this MIB are arranged into several MIB groups.
          Each group is organized as a set of related objects.

          These groups are the basic unit of conformance: if the
          semantics of a group is applicable to an implementation then
          all objects in the group must be implemented.

          The PPP MIB is organized into several MIB Groups, including,
          but not limited to, the following groups:
          o The PPP Link Group
          o The PPP LQR Group
          o The PPP LQR Extensions Group
          o The PPP IP Group
          o The PPP Bridge Group
          o The PPP Security Configuration Group
          o The PPP CHAP Group
          o The PPP PAP Group

          This document specifies the following groups:

          The PPP Link Group
               This group represents the lowest "level" of the PPP
               protocol.

          Internet Draft           PPP/LCP MIB                 July 1992


               This group contains two tables, one containing status
               information and the other configuration information.  The
               configuration table is split off of the status so that it
               may be placed in a separate MIB View for security
               purposes.

               Implementation of this group is mandatory for all PPP
               implementations.

          The PPP LQR Group
               This group provides the basic MIB variables that apply to
               the PPP LQR Protocol.  This group provides MIB access to
               the information required for LQR processing. This group
               contains two tables, one containing status information
               and the other configuration information.  The
               configuration table is split off of the status so that it
               may be placed in a separate MIB View for security
               purposes.

               Implementation of the PPP LQR Group is mandatory for all
               PPP implementations that implement LQR.

          The PPP LQR Extensions Group
               The PPP LQR Extensions group contains the most recently
               received LQR packet, as well as the "save" fields that
               are "logically appended"[12] to received LQR packets.
               This is done in order to facilitate external
               implementations of the Link Quality Monitoring policies.

               It is not practical to examine the relevant MIB objects
               which are used to generate LQR packets since LQR policies
               may require synchronization of the values of all data
               used to determine Link Quality; i.e., the values of the
               relevant counters must all be taken at the same instant
               in time.  Thus, by recording the last received LQR
               packet, a synchronized record of the relevant data is
               available.

               As this information may not be efficiently maintained on
               all PPP implementations, implementation of this group is
               optional.

          4.4.  Relationship to Interface and Interface Extensions
          Groups

          The PPP Mib is a medium-specific extension to the standard
          MIB-2 interface group[2] and to the Interface Extensions MIB
          [7].  This section discusses certain components of these
          groups when the interface is a PPP interface.

          The entire PPP instance represents a single interface in the
          sense used in [2] and thus has a single entry in the ifTable.

          All PPP packets are defined in [8] as being broadcast packets.
          Thus, the packets are counted as non-unicast packets in the
          ifTable (ifInNUcastPkts and ifOutNUCastPkts) and as broadcasts
          in the ifExtnsTable (ifExtnsBroadcastsReceivedOks and
          ifExtnsBroadcastsTransmittedOks).

          ifSpecific
               Contains the OBJECT IDENTIFIER ppp.

          ifAdminStatus
               Setting this object to up will inject an administrative
               open event into the LCP's finite state machine.  Setting
               this object to down will inject an administrative close
               event into the LCP's finite state machine.

               The use of the testing value is beyond the scope of this
               document.

          ifOperStatus
               Represents the state of the LCP Finite State Machine.  If
               the Finite State Machine is in the Opened state then the
               value of ifOperStatus is up, otherwise the value of
               ifOperStatus is down.

               The meaning of the testing value is beyond the scope of
               this document.

          Per the SNMP Protocol Specification, [15], the linkUp and
          linkDown traps apply to the PPP Protocol entity.  When the
          LCP's Finite State Machine attains the Opened state, a linkUp
          trap should be sent. When the Finite State Machine leaves the
          Opened state, a linkDown trap should be sent.

          Some tests for the link are defined in this document.
          Execution of these tests does not place the link's
          ifOperStatus in the testing state as these tests do not
          prevent normal data transmission from occuring over the link.

          5.4.  PPP Tests

          The extensions to the interface table in [7] define a table
          through which the network manager can instruct the managed
          object to perform various tests of the interface. This is the
          ifExtnsTestTable.

          The PPP MIB defines two such tests.

          5.4.1.  PPP Echo Test

          The PPP Echo Test is defined as

               pppEchoTest    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pppTests 1 }

          Invoking this test causes a PPP Echo Packet to be sent on the
          line. ifExtnsTestResult returns success(2) if the echo
          response came back properly. It returns failed(7) if the
          response did not properly return. The definition of "proper"
          in this context is left to the discretion of the implementor.

          5.4.2.  PPP Discard Test

          The PPP Discard Test is defined as

               pppDiscardTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pppTests 2 }

          Invoking this test causes a PPP Discard Packet to be sent on
          the line. ifExtnsTestResult returns success(2) if the discard
          packet was successfully transmitted and failed(7) if an error
          was detected on transmission. The definition of "transmission
          error" in this context is left to the discretion of the
          implementor.

          7.  Security Considerations

          The PPP MIB affords the network operator the ability to
          configure and control the PPP links of a particular system,
          including the PPP authentication protocols. This represents a
          security risk.

          These risks are addressed in the following manners:

          (1)  All variables which represent a significant security risk
               are placed in separate, optional, MIB Groups. As the MIB
               Group is the quantum of implementation within a MIB, the
               implementor of the MIB may elect not to implement these
               groups.

          (2)  The implementor may choose to implement the variables
               which present a security risk so that they may not be
               written, i.e., the variables are READ-ONLY. This method
               still presents a security risk, and is not recommended,
               in that the variables, specifically the PPP
               Authentication Protocols' variables, may be easily read.

          (3)  Using the new SNMP administrative framework[13,14], the
               operator can place the variables into MIB views which are
               protected in that the parties which have access to those
               MIB views use authentication and privacy protocols, or
               the operator may elect to make these views not accessible
               to any party.  In order to facilitate this placement, all
               security-related variables are placed in separate MIB
               Tables. This eases the identification of the necessary
               MIB View Subtree.
