Abstract

   The Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) defines an ERROR_SPEC object
   for communicating errors.  That object has a defined format that
   permits the definition of 256 error codes.  As RSVP has been
   developed and extended, the convention has been to be conservative in
   communicating errors.  Further, no provision for user defined errors
   exists in RSVP.

1. Introduction

   The Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205] defines an
   ERROR_SPEC object for communicating errors.  That object has a
   defined format that permits the definition of 256 error codes.  As
   RSVP has been developed and extended, the convention has been to be
   conservative in communicating errors.  Further no provision for user
   defined errors exists in RSVP.

   When developing extensions to RSVP it is often useful for those
   implementing to define error messages to aid both in the initial
   debugging and in testing against older versions or other implementa-
   tions.

   This document defines a new RSVP object to permit user defined errors
   to be communicated.  This will enable diverse organizations to define
   errors which they can use for internal development.  These error val-
   ues could also be shared with the community at large to aid in pro-
   moting interoperability between diverse implementations.

   RSVP PathErr and ResvErr messages require the presence of an
   ERROR_SPEC object.  [RFC3473] defines the Notify message that also
   requires the presence of an ERROR_SPEC object.  In order to not
   change the mandatory contents of these messages, this document
   defines a new error code value that indicates that the new object is
   present and carries a user defined error code.



1.1. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].


2. User Defined Error

      Error Code = <tba>: User Error Spec

      This error code is used to signal the presence of a
      USER_ERROR_SPEC.  No subcodes are defined.

   When sending this error code, a USER_ERROR_SPEC object SHOULD be
   included in the PathErr, ResvErr or Notify message.

3. USER_ERROR_SPEC Class

   A new RSVP object class is defined called the the USER_ERROR_SPEC
   Class.  The class number is taken from the range 192 - 247.  This is
   done for backward compatibility.  Existing implementations will
   ignore the object and pass it along.


   USER_DEFINED_ERROR object: Class = <tba>, C-Type = 1

      0                   1                   2                   3

        Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)

           A unique identifier of an organization.  OUIs are assigned by
           the IEEE.

        Sub-organization

           An organization MAY use this field to create independent
           Error Value spaces.  This is intended to facilitate teams
           which are doing parallel development.  If independent
           spaces are not required, this field SHOULD be set to zero.

        User Error Value

           The format and contents are specified by the (sub-)
           organization indicated by the OUI and Sub Org fields.

        User Defined Sub-TLVs

           The format and contents are specified by the (sub-)
           organization indicated by the OUI and Sub Org fields.

4. Procedures for using the User Error Spec

4.1. Procedures for sending the User Error Spec

   A USER_DEFINED_ERROR object MAY be included in any PathErr or ResvErr
   message.  The Organizationally Unique Identifier MUST be a valid
   value assigned by the IEEE.  As specified in [RFC2205], an ERROR_SPEC
   object MUST be included with a valid error code.  If no other error
   code applies, the error code MUST be set to <tba>, Unspecified Error.


4.2. Procedures for receiving the User Error Spec

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations at a minimum log the OUI, Sub-
   organization, and User Error Value.  If an implementation is capable
   of interpreting the contents of the User Error Spec it MAY take any
   appropriate action.



5. IANA Considerations

   This document makes the following assignments from the RSVP Error
   Codes and Globally-Defined Error Value Sub-Codes registry (pending
   IANA action):

        Value           Name

        <tba>           User Error Spec

   This document makes the following assignments from the RSVP Class
   Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types registry (pending IANA action):

       Number Space     Value       Name

       Class Numbers    <tba>*      User Error Spec

       Class Type         1         User Defined Error

   * Assignment is requested from the range 192 through 247

6. Security Considerations

   This document makes no changes to the basic message exchanges of
   [RFC2205] and [RFC3473].  It will result in a small increase in the
   number of error messages sent in cases where messages were silently
   dropped due to the lack of an appropriate error code.
