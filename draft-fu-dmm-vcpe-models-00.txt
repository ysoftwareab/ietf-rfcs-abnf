Abstract

   This document introduces the concept of Virtual Customer Premises
   Equipment (VCPE).  Such concept was first proposed in Broadband Forum
   (BBF) as Network Enhanced Residential Gateway (NERG).  The VCPE is
   the Home Agent (HA) of the Mobile Nodes (MN) attached to the physical
   CPE (pCPE).  In this document, we explain the motivation and
   advantages of VCPE.  Three usecases of VCPE is further discussed in
   the enterprise network, the residential network, and the Internet of
   Things (IoT) Network.  Two models of field deployment of VCPE are
   discussed afterwards.  The models of VCPE decompose the Control Plane
   (CP) and the Data Plane (DP), which makes it easier for the
   deployment of the distributed mobility model.

1.  Introduction

   This document introduces the concept of VCPE.  The concept of VCPE is
   to shift most of the networking and service functionalities from the
   customer side to the network side.  In this way, the customer side's
   equipment, that is the pCPE (Physical Customer Premises Equiptment),
   can be simplified.  The VCPE refers to one or a set of equipments at
   the network side to execute the networking and service
   functionalities used to be executed at the CPE.  In such
   architecture, the CPE can be a simple L2 switch, which is only
   responsible for forwarding packets to a certain next hop.  The
   concept of VCPE was first introduced in BBF as NERG (WT-317), which
   mainly focuses on shifting some of the functionalities of a
   residential gateway to the operator's network, for enabling network
   based features.  The aim is to facilitate the deployment, maintenance
   and evolution of both existing and new capabilities without adding
   complexity to the RG and/or the home network.

   Figure 1 shows the architecture of the pCPE and the VCPE.  In this
   architecture, the VCPE is the HA for the mobile nodes adhear to the
   pCPE at the network side.

   In this document, we would like to further propose such concept in
   the following aspects:

   (1) Motivation and advantages of VCPE.

   (2) Usecases of VCPE.  We propose three usecases, including the
   enterprise network, the residential network, and the IoT (Internet of
   things) network.

   (3) Models of VCPE deployment.  We propose two models for the field
   deployment of VCPE.  Such models can be used for deployments in
   multiple scenarios, including both residential network and enterprise
   network.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Motivation and Advantage of VCPE

   The motivation and advantage of introduting VCPE can be concluded as
   follows:

   (1) It will reduce the cost of manufacturing and maintaining of the
   pCPE.  By shifting most of the complicated functions from the
   customer's side to the operator's side, the cost of the pCPE can be
   reduced significantly.  Such redunction can be remarkable in the
   enterprise network, since network functions, such as Firewall and
   NAT(Network Address Translator) at the customer side can be
   expensive.  In the meantime, deployment of VCPE can also reducing the
   OPEX of operators.  Orders of on-site repair can be reduced because
   of the simplicity of the customer equiptments.

   (2) It will avoid complicating the pCPE devices when providing value-
   added L3-L7 services to the customers.  Take the transport network as
   example.  Traditionally, pCPEs at the enterprise customer side are
   simple L2 devices in the transport network.  In order to meet the
   requirements for value-added L3-L7 services from the customers, the
   pCPEs should be redesigned to become L3 or even more complicated
   devices.  Such devices will not only result in an increase of
   manufacture and maintenance cost, and will also request addtional
   efforts for frequent update to meet the constantly increased
   requirements of the customers.  Nevertheless, by utilizing the VCPE
   achitecture, pCPE can remain to be a simple L2 device, which is only
   responsible for L2 forwarding.  In this way, frequent update of these
   pCPEs is not necessary, which will greatly decrease both CAPEX and
   OPEX of the network operators.

   (3) It will greatly speed up the service launching period.  Since
   most of the complicated functions are located at the VCPE in the
   network side, operators have more power over services.  Benefitting
   from the recent NFV (Network Function Virtualization) and cloud
   technologies, VCPE can be accomplished using SFC in the virtual
   network, where different services can act as different VNFs (Virtual
   Network Functions).  Operators only need to add new VNFs on the VCPE
   side to launch new services to the customers.  In this way, Operators
   can provide a variety of services through the network.

   (4) It will provide user-define-network experience.  By introducing
   SFC concept into the VCPE, users can define his own service order and
   sequence.  Therefore, enterprise customers can enjoy the self-defined
   services over the public network.

4.  Use case of VCPE

   The concept of VCPE can be used in multiple scenarios.  In this
   section, we will propose two use cases of VCPE, one in residential
   network, and the other in the enterprise network.

   (1) Use Case of VCPE in the Enterprise network.

   Traditional enterprise network uses the tranport network access.
   Multiple network functions, including Firewall (FW) and NAT, are
   deployed at the enterprise customer's side.  Such deployment not only
   increases the cost of the equiptment at the customer side, but also
   makes it difficult for both the enterprise customers and the service
   providers operating and maintaining the functions.

   By introducing VCPE into the transport network, functions such as FW
   and NAT can be shifted to the aggregate network or core network,
   acting as VCPE at the service provider's side.  Moreover, value-added

Internet-Draft  Motivations, usecases and Models of VCPE       July 2015


   services can be provided.  For example, by deploying a virtual Deep
   Packet Inspection (vDPI), service providers can provide fine grained
   data control to the enterprise customers.

   (2) Use case of VCPE in the residential network.

   In the residential network, traditionally, pCPE locates at the
   customer premises terminates the home network and connect the LAN
   devices to the Internet or to some service platforms through the
   broadband access network.  With the expansion of the broadband access
   and the development of the OTT (Over The Top) industry, the quantity
   and requirements of addtional functions of pCPE increases rapidly.
   By shifting most of the complicated functions to VCPE, the cost of
   the largely deployed CPE can be saved.  In the meantime, deployment
   of new features by service providers can be accelerated.

   Taking PPPoE access as example.  By shifting PPPoE client to VCPE,
   pCPE can be a simple L2 device.  In this case, VCPE takes the
   responsibility to initiate PPPoE request to BRAS once receiving
   traffic flow from the customers.  When receiving the certification
   from BRAS, VCPE will act as DHCP server by assigning IP address to
   the traffic generating port.  Such approach can also be used for IPv6
   upgrade,in which case VCPE can act as IPv6 DHCP relay.

   (3) Use case of VCPE in the IoT (Internet of Things) network.

   VCPE can also be used in the IoT network.  So far, multiple wireless
   communication standards, including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Blue Tooth, and
   etc., exist for the connection of the IoT devices to the GW.  The IoT
   GW is responsible for decomposing the L2 packets from the devices,
   composing them into L3 packets and transferring to the Internet
   Server.  Due to these various wireless communication standards,
   multiple IoT GWs have to be deployed at users' home to support
   different IoT devices.  By shifting the packet transforming function
   to VCPE, IoT GW can be a simple and unified L2 forwarding GW, while
   VCPE will support different standard stacks and is responsible for
   transforming packets following different communication standards to
   IP packets.

5.  Models of VCPE Deployment

   There are multiple models when deploying VCPE in use cases as are
   discussed in the previous section.  In this document, we conclude the
   deployment of VCPE into two models.  In the first model, a logical
   instance of VCPE is deployed in the cloud for each pCPE instance.
   All traffic from pCPE goes through the vCPE.  In the second model,
   the VCPE is based on service chains attached to BNG.  The classifier
   on BNG puts the pCPE traffic through the correct set of service

   functions.  Both of these two models can easily introduce CP/DP
   decompositon at the VCPE side, and the DMM protocol can be used.

   Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the two models of VCPE deployment.  For
   the first model, logical instance of VCPE is deployed.  Such logical
   instance can be a seperate instance deployed before or after the BNG,
   as is shown in Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b).  It can also be deployed
   by upgrading the traditional BNG to include the functions of VCPE, as
   is shown in Figure 1(c).

   For the second models, no logical instance exists as VCPE.  VCPE is
   realized as a sequence of service function chaining (SFC) in the WAN
   DC.  In this model, BNG is acting as the classifier of SFC.  Such
   classfication should be based on user profile, in which case, users
   can define his own VCPE service.

   SDN (Software Define Network) controllers can also be introduced in
   the second model.  In which case, all of the pCPEs and the BNG data
   plane (BNG-dp) can be controlled by the SDN-controller (also acting
   as the BNG control plane(BNG-cp)), as is shown in Figure 3.  When the
   customer selects a set of services, the SDN-controller will inform
   the pCPE and the BNG-dp to direct the traffic flow to a certain SFC.
   the Service Classification Function (SCF) is located in the BNG,
   responsible for classifing traffic from different customer/network/
   service.  The SCF is controlled by the SDN-controller.  When a packet
   arrives, the SCF will ask the controller which Service Founction Path
   (SFP) this flow should follow, and put corresponding SFC
   encapsulation into the packet.  The packet then goes into the service
   founction region, and will be directed to different Service
   Founctions (SF) based on the encapsulation.

6.  Conclusion

   In this document, the concept of VCPE is illustrated in detail.  The
   basic concept of VCPE is to shift the complicated functions from the
   pCPE at the customer side to the VCPE at the service provider side.
   The motivation of such shifting can be concluded as reducing the
   Capex and Opex of the pCPE, and providing quick launched customer
   defined services in the meantime.  Three use cases are proposed for
   VCPE, including scenarios in the enterprise network, the residential
   network and the IoT network.  Two models are then discussed for the
   field deployment of VCPE.
