          draft   ATM Textual Conventions and OBJECT-IDENTITIES~~~~~~January 8, 1997


          2.  Introduction

          This memo describes Textual Conventions and OBJECT-IDENTITIES
          used for managing ATM-based interfaces, devices, networks and
          services.

          When designing a MIB module, it is often useful to define new
          types similar to those defined in the SMI.  In comparison to a
          type defined in the SMI, each of these new types has a
          different name, a similar syntax, but a more precise
          semantics.  These newly defined types are termed textual
          conventions, and are used for the convenience of humans
          reading the MIB module.  This is done through Textual
          Conventions as defined in RFC1903[1].  It is the purpose of
          this document to define the set of textual conventions
          available to ATM MIB modules.

          When designing MIB modules, it is also often useful to
          register further properties with object identifier assignments
          so that they can be further used by other MIB modules.  This
          is done through the OBJECT-IDENTITY macro defined in
          RFC1902[2].  This document defines OBJECT-IDENTITIES available
          to ATM MIB modules.

          Note that for organizational purposes OBJECT IDENTITIES
          previously defined in RFC1695 have been moved to this
          specification and no longer appear in the revision of
          RFC1695[14]. However, the original OBJECT IDENTIFIERs have
          been preserved.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.
