Abstract

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol provides mobility management for an
   IPv4-only mobile nodes.  It provides network-based mobility
   management and session continuity for the IPv4 mobile node as long as
   the mobile node is attached to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  The
   mobile node that attaches to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, may also
   implement Mobile IPv4.  When a Mobile IPv4-capable mobile node
   attaches to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, there are some interactions

Internet-Draft        PMIPv6 and MIPv4 interworking        February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol [3] is a network-based mobility
   management protocol that provides mobility management for both IPv4
   and IPv6 mobile nodes as long as they are attached to the same Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain.  These mobile nodes that attach to the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain may also implement host-based mobility management
   protocols like Mobile IPv6 [5] or Mobile IPv4 [2].  The interactions
   between Proxy Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv6 are described in [6].  This
   document captures a scenario related to interactions between Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4.

   The scenario of particular interest in this document is where the
   MIPv4 Home Agent and the Proxy Mobile IPv6 Local Mobility Anchor
   functionality are co-located on the same network node.  The mobile
   node performs handovers between the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain and the
   Mobile IPv4 foreign link.  The Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain may also
   appear as the home link for the mobile node with respect to Mobile
   IPv4.  This document describes this scenario in more detail.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].


3.  Transitioning between Proxy Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4

   The following describes a scenario where the mobile node moves
   between access network(s) that are part of the Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain and an access network that is outside the Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain.  The mobile node implements the Mobile IPv4 mobile node
   functionality as described in [2].  The Mobile IPv4 home agent
   function and the Proxy Mobile IPv6 LMA function are co-located on the
   same network node.

   In this scenario, the mobile node uses Proxy Mobile IPv6 as long as
   it is in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  Since the mobile node is an
   IPv4 node, the MAG obtains an IPv4 address from the LMA using the
   Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement exchange as
   described in [4].  The MAG then assigns the IPv4 address to the
   mobile node.  The mobile node may also use DHCP to configure the IPv4
   address as described in [4].

   The mobile node has the Mobile IPv4 stack active at the same time,
   but as long as it is attached to the same Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain,

   it will appear as if it is attached to the home link.  If the mobile
   node attaches to an access network that is not part of the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain, it acquires a care-of address from the access
   networks, treats the IPv4 address acquired earlier in the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain as the Mobile IPv4 home address and performs a
   Mobile IPv4 registration.  The Mobile IPv4 registration is performed
   with the same home agent that was earlier a local mobility anchor in
   the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  If the foreign link supports the
   foreign agent functionality, the mobile node does not configure a co-
   located care-of address.

   The home agent supporting the mobile node based on host-based
   mobility management, is also configured to function as a local
   mobility anchor for supporting local mobility management.  The IPv4
   address configured by the mobile node in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain
   is the same as the MIPv4 home address when the mobile node is
   attached to a foreign link.  This is illustrated in Figure 1.

3.1.  Booting up in the PMIPv6 domain

   According to Section 2 of RFC 3344 [2], the mobile node should
   receive an Agent Advertisement from its home agent to detect that it
   is attached to the home link.  The Agent Advertisement from a home
   agent is distinguishable by the presence of the 'H' bit in the
   advertisement.

   In the scenario presented in Section 3, the mobile node is attached
   to the home link when it is in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  When
   the mobile node boots up in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, it first
   authenticates itself to the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and sets up a
   point-to-point link with the MAG.  The current Proxy Mobile IPv6
   specification only supports point-to-point links between the mobile
   node and the MAG.  As soon as the point-to-point link is up, the
   mobile node should send an agent solicitation to check if it is
   attached to the home link.  When the MAG sees the agent solicitation
   from the mobile node, it identifies that the mobile node has the
   Mobile IPv4 client active.  The MAG then sends an Agent Advertisement
   on behalf of the Home Agent function co-located with the LMA
   function.  The 'Router Address' field in the Agent Advertisement is
   set to the IPv4 address of the co-located MIPv4 Home Agent and PMIPv6
   LMA functions.

   When the mobile node receives the Agent Advertisement with the 'H'
   flag set, it discovers that it is attached to the MIPv4 home link.
   The mobile node extracts the address from the 'Router Address' field
   in the Agent Advertisement and stores it as the MIPv4 home agent
   address.

   Figure 2 shows the sequence of steps by which the mobile node
   discovers that it is attached to the home link.

3.2.  Handover from PMIPv6 domain to non-PMIPv6 domain

   When the mobile node moves to an access network that is outside the
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, it starts Mobile IPv4 operation.  The
   mobile node performs movement detection as specified in [2].  If
   there is a foreign agent on the access network, it starts using the
   foreign agent.  If there is no foreign agent on the access network,
   the mobile node configures a care-of address from the access network.

   Once the mobile node configures a care-of address from the access
   network, it sends a registration request to the home agent.  It uses
   the home agent address obtained via the Home Agent Advertisement it
   received while attached to the home link in the Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain.  The mobile MAY include the IPv4 address configured when
   attached to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain as the home address in the
   registration request.  The mobile node MAY also set the home address
   to 0.0.0.0 in the registration request as specified in [2].

   When the home agent receives the registration request for the mobile
   node, it processes the registration request and creates a Mobile IPv4

   binding cache entry for the mobile node.  If there is a Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 binding cache entry for the mobile node, that entry is deleted.
   If the registration request had a valid home address, the home agent
   creates a binding cache entry for the home address.  If the
   registration request had the home address field set to 0.0.0.0, the
   home agent allocates the PMIPv6 IPv4 MN-HoA previously assigned to
   the mobile node as the Mobile IPv4 home address.  The home agent then
   sends a registration reply to the mobile node as specified in [2].

   Figure 3 shows the sequence of steps involved in the handover from a
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to an access router or a foreign agent
   outside the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.

3.3.  Handover in to the PMIPv6 domain

   When the mobile node moves in to an access network that is part of
   the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, it is again attached to its home link.
   It detects that it is attached to the home link when it receives a
   home agent advertisement advertising the home link.

   When the mobile node moves into the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, the LMA
   receives a Proxy Binding Update from the MAG.  The LMA that is co-
   located with the Mobile IPv4 home agent functions responds with an
   IPv4 address that is the same as the Mobile IPv4 home address.  The
   LMA also deletes the Mobile IPv4 binding cache entry for the mobile
   node and creates a proxy binding cache entry for the mobile node.
   The LMA then sends a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message to the MAG
   with the assigned IPv4 address.  The MAG after processing the Proxy
   Binding Acknowledgement, sends a Home Agent advertisement message to
   the mobile node.

   When the mobile node detects that it is attached to the home link, it
   sends a registration request to the home agent with lifetime set to
   zero to delete the binding cache entry.  If the home agent receives a
   de-registration message (registration request with lifetime set to
   zero), when there is a proxy binding cache entry for the mobile node,
   it MUST NOT delete the proxy binding cache entry.  Instead it MUST
   respond to the mobile node with a registration reply acknowledging
   the de-registration.

   Figure 4 shows the sequence of steps involved in the handover from an
   access link outside the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain in to the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain.

4.  Security Considerations

   In the scenario described in Section 3, the mobile node transitions
   between using Proxy Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4.  The binding cache
   entry for the mobile node may be modified both by the MAGs in the
   PMIPv6 domain and the mobile node.  In Mobile IPv4, the binding cache
   entry created by the mobile node can only be modified by the mobile
   node.  This document requires that the MIPv4 home agent that also
   implements the PMIPv6 LMA functionality should allow both the mobile
   node and the authorized MAGs to modify the binding cache entry for

Appendix A.  Application of PMIPv6 - MIPv4 interactions to LTE-HRPD
             handovers

   The 3GPP specification TS 23.402 [7] specifies handovers between 3GPP
   LTE access and 3GPP2 HPRD access.  This section describes how the
   inter-working mechanism specified in Section 3 can be applied to
   handovers between LTE and HRPD access networks.

   The interworking between Mobile IPv4 and Proxy Mobile IPv6 is
   especially of interest for the LTE-HRPD inter-system handover.  The
   HRPD network already has the Mobile IPv4 protocol implemented and
   deployed.  The LTE network will have the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol
   deployed to support mobility management for the mobile node.  For
   handsets that are dual mode (support both LTE and HRPD technologies)
   there is no common mobility protocol.

   Mobility management for the mobile node can be supported though for
   these nodes by having an interworking solution between Mobile IPv4
   and Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This solution should work for nodes that may
   not implement IPv6 and should work with minimal changes to legacy
   nodes on the HRPD network, for example, the PDSN.

   The solution described in this document introduces the concept of
   making the mobile node appear to be on the Home link with respect to
   the Mobile IPv4 protocol when it is attached to the LTE network and
   is in the PMIPv6 domain.  When the Mobile Node is in the HRPD
   network, Mobile IPv4 Foreign Agent care-of address mode is used.

   The solution requires the Proxy Mobile IPv6 LMA functionality and the
   Mobile IPv4 home agent functionality to be co-located which will most
   likely reside on the PDN-GW in the LTE network.

   When the mobile node first attaches to the LTE network, during
   authentication the MN profile will indicate that this is a dual mode
   MN that has subscription on both the LTE and HRPD networks.  The
   profile can additionally indicate that the Mobile Node is an IPv4
   only node.  When the MAG on the Serving-GW sends the Proxy Binding
   Update (PBU) message to the LMA, it requests for a dynamic IPv4 Home
   Address allocation for the MN.  It does so by setting the IPv4 Home
   Address field to all zeros in the IPv4 Home Address option.

   The LMA that can reside on the PDN-GW assigns an IPv4 HoA to the
   mobile node and returns this address in the Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement message to the MAG.  Once the PMIPv6 tunnel between
   the MAG and the LMA is set up, the S-GW sends out a Home Agent
   Advertisement message for the mobile node with the home agent address
   set to the PDN-GW address.  This indicates to the mobile node that it
   is attached to the home link.

A.1.  LTE to HRPD Handover

   In the LTE to HRPD handover, the PDSN downloads the mobile node
   profile during access authentication.  The profile would indicate
   that the mobile node is a dual mode device that can connect to the
   LTE as well as HRPD network.  The profile may also indicate to the
   PDSN that it should use a certain PDN-GW as the Mobile IPv4 home
   agent for the mobile node.

   The PDSN sends a Foreign Agent Advertisement message.  This Agent
   advertisement prompts the MN to send a Mobile IPv4 Registration
   request message.  The home address field in the message is set to
   0.0.0.0.  The PDSN forwards the registration request to the PDN-GW.
   The PDN-GW acting as the Mobile IPv4 home agent returns the same
   address that was assigned as Proxy Mobile IPv6 IPv4 MN-HoA as the
   Mobile IPv4 home address.

   The home address is returned to the PDSN in a Mobile IPv4
   Registration Reply message.  The Foreign Agent function on the PDSN
   forwards the Registration Reply message to the mobile node indicating
   the Mobile IPv4 home address to use.

   The mobile node can now roam on the HRPD network using the Mobile
   IPv4 protocol and the MIPv4 home address using the FA address on the
   PDSN as the care-of address.

A.2.  HRPD to LTE Handover

   When a HRPD to LTE handover is performed, the access authentication
   phase supplies the mobile node's profile to the MME.  This indicates
   to the MME that the MN is a dual mode handset that is capable of
   interworking.  Once the bearer establishment between mobile node and
   the Serving-GW is done, the Serving-GW will send a Proxy Binding to
   the PDN-GW to perform a PMIPv6 registration.  The Serving-GW will
   request for an IPv4 address for the MN in the Proxy Binding Update
   message.

   The PDN GW responds with a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement including
   the IPv4 MN-HoA information.  This creates a PMIPv6 tunnel between
   the MAG on the Serving-GW and the LMA on the PDN-GW.  The Serving-GW
   then sends a Home Agent advertisement on behalf of the PDN-GW to make
   it appear to the mobile node that it is attached to the home link.

A.3.  Serving-GW Relocation

   When the mobile node moves from one Serving-GW to another in the
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, it is assigned the same IPv4 address.  As
   long as the mobile node attaches to MAGs inside the Proxy Mobile IPv6

   domain, mobility management is done using Proxy Mobile IPv6.  The
   mobile node configures the same IPv4 MN-HoA across the Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 domain.  The Serving-GWs that the mobile node attaches to send a
   Home Agent advertisement to the mobile node to make it appear that it
   is still attached to the home link.
