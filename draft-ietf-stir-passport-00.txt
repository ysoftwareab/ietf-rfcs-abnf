                        Persona Assertion Token
                      draft-ietf-stir-passport-00

Abstract

   This document defines a token format for verifying with non-
   repudiation the sender of and authorization to send information
   related to the originator of personal communications.  A
   cryptographic signature is defined to protect the integrity of the
   information used to identify the originator of a personal
   communications session toward a terminating entity.  The
   cryptographic signature is defined with the intention that it can
   confidently verify the originating persona even when the signature is
   sent to the terminating party over a potentially unsecure channel.
   The Persona Assertion Token (PASSporT) is particularly useful for
   many personal communications applications over IP networks and other
   multi-hop interconnection scenarios where the originating and
   terminating parties may not have a direct trusted relationship.

1.  Introduction

   In today's IP-enabled telecommunications world, there is a growing
   concern about the ability to trust incoming invitations for
   communications sessions, including video, voice and messaging.  As an
   example, modern telephone networks provide the ability to spoof the
   telephone number for many legitimate purposes including providing
   network features and services on the behalf of a legitimate telephone

   number.  However, as we have seen, bad actors have taken advantage of
   this ability for illegitimate and fraudulent purposes meant to trick
   telephone users to believe they are someone they are not.  This
   problem can be extended to many emerging forms of personal
   communications.

   This document defines a common method for creating and validating a
   token that cryptographically verifies an originating identity, or
   more generally a URI or application specific identity string
   representing the originator of personal communications.  Through
   extended profiles other information associated with the originating
   party or the transport of the personal communications can be attached
   to the token.  The primary goal of PASSporT is to provide a common
   framework for signing persona related information in an extensible
   way.  A secondary goal is to provide this functionality independent
   of any specific personal communications signaling call logic, so that
   creation and verification of persona information can be implemented
   in a flexible way and can be used in many personal communications
   applications including end-to-end applications that require different
   signaling protocol interworking.  It is anticipated that signaling
   protocol specific guidance will be provided in other related
   documents and specifications to specify how to use and transport
   PASSporT tokens, however this is intentionally out of scope for this
   document.

   Note: As of the authoring of this document,
   [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis] provides details of how to use PASSporT
   within SIP signaling for the signing and verification of telephone
   numbers and there is a parallel.

2.  Token Overview

   Tokens are a convenient way of encapsulating information with
   associated digital signatures.  They are used in many applications
   that require authentication, authorization, encryption and other use
   cases.  JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] and JSON Web Signature (JWS)
   [RFC7515] are designed to provide a compact form for many of these
   purposes and define a specific method and syntax for signing a
   specific set of information or "claims" within the token and
   therefore providing an extensible set of claims.  Additionally, JWS
   provides extensible mechanisms for specifying the method and
   cryptographic algorithms used for the associated digital signatures.

3.  PASSporT Definition

   The PASSporT is constructed based on JWT [RFC7519] and JWS [RFC7515]
   specifications.  JWS defines the use of JSON data structures in a
   specified canonical format for signing data corresponding to JOSE



Wendt & Peterson         Expires August 24, 2016                [Page 3]

   header, JWS Payload, and JWS Signature.  JWT defines specific set of
   claims that are represented by specified key value pairs which can be
   extended with custom keys for specific applications.

3.1.  PASSporT Header

   The JWS token header is a JOSE header [RFC7515] that defines the type
   and encryption algorithm used in the token.

   An example of the header for the case of a RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 SHA-256
   digital signature would be the following,

               { "typ":"passport",
                 "alg":"RS256",
                 "x5u":"https://cert.example.org/passport.crt" }

3.1.1.  "typ" (Type) Header Parameter

   JWS defines the "typ" (Type) Header Parameter to declare the media
   type [IANA.MediaTypes] of the JWS.

   This represents that the encoded token is a JWT, and the JWT is a JWS
   using the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 SHA-256 algorithm.

   For PASSporT Token the "typ" header MUST minimally include and begin
   with "passport".

3.1.2.  "alg" (Algorithm) Header Parameter

   For PASSporT, the "alg" should be defined as RS256 as the recommended
   algorithm.  Note that JWA [RFC7518] defines other algorithms that may
   be utilized or updated in the future depending on cryptographic
   strength requirements guided by current security best practice.

3.1.3.  "x5u" (X.509 URL) Header Parameter

   As defined in JWS, the "x5u" header parameter is used to provide a
   URI [RFC3986] referring to the resource for the X.509 public key
   certificate or certificate chain [RFC5280] corresponding to the key
   used to digitally sign the JWS.  Note: The definition of what the URI
   represents in terms of the actor serving the X.509 public key is out
   of scope of this document.  However, generally this would correspond
   to an HTTPS or DNSSEC resource with the guidance that it MUST be a
   TLS protected, per JWS spec.

3.2.  PASSporT Token Claim

   The token claim should consist of the information which needs to be
   verified at the terminating party.  This claim should correspond to a
   JWT claim and be encoded as defined by the JWS Payload.

   The PASSporT defines the use of a number of standard JWT defined
   headers as well as two new custom headers corresponding to the two
   parties associated with personal communications, the originator and
   terminator.  These headers or key value pairs are detailed below.

   The JSON claim MUST include the following registered JWT defined
   claims:

   o  "iat" - issued at, time the JWT was issued, used for expiration.
      This is included for securing the token against replay and cut and
      paste attacks, as explained further in the security considerations
      in section 7.

   Verified Token specific claims that MUST be included:

   o  "orig" - the originating identity claimed. (e.g. for SIP, the FROM
      or P-AssertedID [RFC3325] associated e.164 telephone number, TEL
      or SIP URI) This SHOULD be in URI format as defined in [RFC3986]
      if appropriate but could also be an application specific identity
      string.

   o  "term" - the terminating identity claimed as the intended
      destination by the originating party. (e.g. for SIP, the TO
      associated e.164 telephone number, TEL or SIP URI) This SHOULD be
      in URI format as defined in [RFC3986] if appropriate but could
      also be an application specific identity string.

   An example claim is as follows,

               { "iat": 1443208345,
                 "orig":"+12155551212",
                 "term":"sip:+12155551213@example.com" }

3.3.  PASSporT Signature

   The signature of the PASSporT is created as specified by JWS using
   the private key corresponding to the X.509 public key certificate
   referenced by the "x5u" header parameter.

4.  Extending PASSporT

   PASSporT represents the bare minimum set of claims needed to assert
   the originating identity, however there will certainly be new and
   extended applications and usage of PASSPorT that will need to
   extending claims to represent other information specific to the
   origination identities beyond the identity itself.

   There are two mechanisms defined to extend PASSporT.  The first
   includes an extension of the base passport claims to include
   additional claims.  An alternative method of extending PASSporT is
   for applications of PASSporT unrelated to the base set of claims,
   that will define it's own set of claims.  Both are described below.

4.1.  "ppt" (PASSporT) header parameter

   For extended profiles of PASSporT, a new JWS header parameter "ppt"
   MUST be used with a string that uniquely identifies the profile
   specification that defines any new claims that would extend the base
   set of claims of PASSporT.

   An example header with an extended PASSporT profile of "foo" is as
   follows:

               { "typ":"passport",
                 "ppt":"foo",
                 "alg":"RS256",
                 "x5u":"https://tel.example.org/passport.crt" }

4.2.  Extended PASSporT Claims

   Future specifications that define such extensions to the PASSporT
   mechanism MUST explicitly designate what claims they include, the
   order in which they will appear, and any further information
   necessary to implement the extension.  All extensions MUST
   incorporate the baseline JWT elements specified in Section 3; claims
   may only be appended to the claims object specified in there, they
   can never be subtracted re-ordered.  Specifying new claims follows
   the baseline JWT procedures ([RFC7519] Section 10.1).  Note that
   understanding an extension as a verifier is always optional for
   compliance with this specification (though future specifications or
   profiles for deployment environments may make other "ppt" values
   mandatory).  The creator of a PASSporT object cannot assume that
   verifiers will understand any given extension.  Verifiers that do
   support an extension may then trigger appropriate application-level
   behavior in the presence of an extension; authors of extensions
   should provide appropriate extension-specific guidance to application
   developers on this point.

Internet-Draft                  PASSporT                   February 2016


4.3.  Alternate PASSporT Extension

   Some applications may want to use the mechanism of the PASSporT
   digital signature that is not a superset of the base set of claims of
   the PASSporT token as defined in Section 3.  Rather, a specification
   may use PASSporT with its own defined set of claims.

   In this case, the specification should define its own MIME media type
   [RFC2046] in the "Media Types" registry [IANA.MediaTypes].  It is
   recommended that the MIME subtype start with the string "passport-"
   to signify that it is related to the PASSporT token.  For example,
   for the "foo" application the MIME type/sub-type could be defined as
   "application/passport-foo".

4.4.  Registering PASSporT Extensions

   In order for interoperability and maintaining uniqueness of the
   extended PASSporT profile header parameter string, there SHOULD be an
   industry registry that tracks the definition of the profile strings.

5.  Deterministic JSON Serialization

   In order to provide a deterministic representation of the PASSporT
   Header and Claims, particularly if PASSporT is used across multiple
   signaling environments, the JSON header object and JSON Claim object
   MUST be computed as follows.

   The JSON object MUST follow the rules for the construction of the
   thumbprint of a JSON Web Key (JWK) as defined in [RFC7638] Section 3.
   Each JSON object MUST contain no whitespace or line breaks before or
   after any syntactic elements and with the required members ordered
   lexicographically by the Unicode [UNICODE] code points of the member
   names.

   In addition, the JSON header and claim members MUST follow the
   lexicographical ordering and character and string rules defined in
   [RFC7638] Section 3.3.

6.  Human Readability

   For many applications, JWT [RFC7519] and JWS [RFC7515] can use Base64
   encoding to the Header and Claims sections as specified.  However,
   many personal communications protocols, such as SIP and XMPP, use a
   "human readable" format to allow for ease of use and ease of
   operational debugging and monitoring.  As such, specifications using
   PASSporT may provide guidance on whether Base64 encoding or plain
   text will be used for the construction of the PASSporT Header and
   Claim sections.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Avoidance of replay and cut and paste attacks

   There are a number of security considerations for use of the token
   for avoidance of replay and cut and paste attacks.  Verified tokens
   must be sent along with other application level protocol information
   (e.g. for SIP an INVITE as defined in [RFC3261]).  There should be a
   link between various information provided in the token and
   information provided by the application level protocol information.

   These would include:

   o  "iat" claim should closely correspond to a date/time the message
      was originated.  It should also be within a relative delta time
      that is reasonable for clock drift and transmission time
      characteristics associated with the application using the verified
      token.

   o  "term" claim is included to prevent the ability to use a
      previously originated message to send to another terminating party

7.2.  Solution Considerations

   It should be recognized that the use of this token should not, in
   it's own right, be considered a full solution for absolute non-
   repudiation of the persona being asserted.  This only provides non-
   repudiation of the signer of PASSporT.  If the signer and the persona
   are not one in the same, which can and often can be the case in
   telecommunications networks today, protecting the terminating party
   for being spoofed may take some interpretation or additional
   verification of the link between the PASSporT signature and the
   persona being asserted.

   In addition, the telecommunications systems and specifications that
   use PASSporT should in practice provide mechanisms for:

   o  Managing X.509 certificates and X.509 certificate chains to an
      authorized trust anchor that can be a trusted entity to all
      participants in the telecommunications network

   o  Accounting for entities that may route calls from other peer or
      interconnected telecommunications networks that are not part of
      the "trusted" communications network or may not be following the
      usage of PASSporT or the profile of PASSporT appropriate to that
      network
