Abstract 
    
   Multicast ESP (MESP) is a framework for multicast data-origin 
   authentication using the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) 
   protocol. The MESP framework combines group-secrecy, group-
   authentication, and source-authentication transforms in an ESP 
   packet. MESP uses a message authentication code for group 
   authentication to protect a digital signature, TESLA timed MAC, or 
   other multicast source-authentication transform.

2.0 Introduction 
    
   The IPsec Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) provides a set of 
   security services that include data origin authentication, which 
   enables an IPsec receiver to validate that a received packet 
   originated from a peer-sender in a pairwise security association 
   [Section 3.1, RFC2401].  A Message Authentication Code (MAC), such 
   as the hash-based message authentication code [RFC2104, RFC2404] 
   (HMAC), is the common means to provide data-origin authentication 
   for pairwise IPsec security associations.  For secure groups such as 
   IP multicast groups, however, a MAC supports only "group 
   authentication" and not data-origin authentication [CP]. This 
   Internet-Draft document (I-D) defines a framework for ESP data-

   origin authentication that is suitable for IP multicast groups of 
   ESP receivers. 
    
2.1 Changes from the Previous Version 
    
   This version is not a protocol, unlike the previous version, but is 
   a transform framework for ESP and realizes all of its functions 
   within the ESP protocol.  MESP now imposes an additional structure 
   and usage on IPsec ESP Initialization Vector (IV) and Integrity 
   Check Value (ICV) fields [ESPbis]. 
    
   A smaller change that appears in this version of MESP is the 
   requirement that TESLA authentication be protected by external 
   authentication transform such as a MAC.   
    
2.2 Overview 
    
   This I-D assumes that the reader is familiar with the "Security 
   Architecture for Internet Protocol" [RFC2401] and the "IP 
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)" [ESPBIS] RFCs. Section 3 
   reviews the functionalities of group data-security transforms for 
   applications such as media streaming, process control, and reliable 
   multicast applications.  Section 3 describes the problem of 
   authenticating the source when the data-authentication key is shared 
   by more than two IPsec endpoints. Section 4 describes the MESP 
   framework in terms of the extensions and use of the ESP IV and 
   integrity-check-value fields. The three functionalities of the MESP 
   framework are realized in cryptographic transforms that are secure 
   for various uses, and Section 5 recites the security considerations 
   for each MESP transform.  Section 5 considers IP multicast risks, 
   the transforms that address a particular risk, and the suitability 
   of a transform for various applications and environments.   
    
3.0 IP Multicast Security Functionalities 
    
   The security requirements for multicast have been discussed in [CP]. 
   In general, group security has different requirements and 
   characteristics than pairwise security.  In particular, data-origin 
   authentication using a MAC will not prevent one member from 
   impersonating another when a group of three or more members share 
   the symmetric authentication key.  There are three new 
   functionalities needed to add data-origin authentication to ESP. 
    
   a) Group Secrecy (GS) 
    
   The GS functionality is ESP confidentiality applied to a group . It 
   ensures that transmitted data are accessible only to group members 
   (i.e. two or more hosts in possession of a shared symmetric key). 
   This can also be viewed as a way to enforce access control. A 
   typical realization of GS is to encrypt data using a key known only 
   to group members. Essentially, the solution for multicast is the 
 
 
 
Baugher, Canetti, Cheng, Rohatgi                              [Page 3] 
INTERNET-DRAFT               Multicast ESP                 March 2003 
 
 
   same as the solution for unicast confidentiality.  It is important 
   to note, however, that some encryption transforms have special 
   considerations when a key is shared among multiple senders.  An MESP 
   encryption or authentication transform SHOULD describe any potential 
   risks of multicast operation and how those risks are averted.  
    
   b) Group Authentication (GA) 
        
   The GA functionality enables a group member to verify that 
   the received data originated from someone in the group and was not  
   modified en-route by a non-group member.  Note that group 
   authentication by itself does not identify the source of the 
   data.  For example, the data might have been forged by any malicious 
   group member. GA can be efficiently realized using standard shared 
   key authentication mechanisms such as Message Authentication Codes 
   (MACs), e.g., CBC-MAC, HMAC, or UMAC.   
    
   c) Source and Data Authentication (SrA)  
    
   The SrA functionality enables a group member to verify that 
   the received data originated from the claimed source and was not  
   modified en-route by anyone (including other malicious group  
   members). Unlike Group Authentication, SrA provides the IPsec data-
   origin authentication function [RFC2401, ESPbis].  Source and Data 
   Authentication provides a much stronger security guarantee than 
   Group Authentication in that a particular group member can be 
   identified as a source of a packet. Group and multicast source 
   authentication requires stronger cryptographic techniques such as 
   digital signatures, stream signatures [GR], flow signatures [WL], 
   hybrid signatures [R], timed MACs, e.g. TESLA [TESLA, 
   Ch,PCTS],asymmetric MACs [CGIMNP], etc. 
    
3.1 Composition of the Functionalities  
    
   A secure multicast solution is likely to utilize all three of the 
   basic functionalities. Due to the diversity of the various 
   application and deployment scenarios for multicast, several issues 
   arise with respect to the composition and ordering of these 
   functionalities.   
    
   In ESP, encryption precedes authentication when both are applied and 
   a "combined-mode" confidentiality/integrity operation is not used 
   [Section 3.3.2 of ESPBIS]. Combined modes of encryption and 
   authentication are supported in ESP [ESPbis] but are not considered 
   in this version of MESP. Encryption first is an efficient ordering 
   that allows the receiver to apply a message authentication code 
   (MAC) before it runs a more computationally-intensive decryption; 
   fast authentication before decryption offers a better defense 
   against bogus packets from a denial of service attack.  In MESP, 
   therefore, the group secrecy (GS) transform MUST precede group 
   authentication (GA) when GS is used.  In other words, the sender 
 
 
 
Baugher, Canetti, Cheng, Rohatgi                              [Page 4] 
INTERNET-DRAFT               Multicast ESP                 March 2003 
 
 
   applies GS prior to GA and the receiver applies GA prior to GS.  
   Krawczyk has shown that it is more secure to authenticate encrypted 
   data rather than encrypt authenticated data [K], but this ordering 
   does not provide non-repudiation. The latter is usually not needed 
   or even desirable for IPsec applications. 
    
   MESP uses the same ordering for SrA: SrA MUST follow GS. Digital 
   signatures offer the simplest method for multicast source 
   authentication (SrA) but are computationally expensive, greatly 
   expand the packet size and impractical for many, if not most, packet 
   flows.  Given the relatively high cost of signature verification, a 
   digital signature leaves the receiver vulnerable to denial of 
   service attack when an attacker succeeds in getting the receiver to 
   perform signature validation of bad packets.   
    
   MESP partially protects the receiver from denial-of-service attacks 
   from bogus digitally-signed packets by applying a MAC to the packet 
   after signing it.  MESP calls this MAC "external authentication" and 
   applies it in an identical fashion to ESP.  The digital signature is 
   called "internal authentication," which the sender applies to the 
   packet payload before the MAC.  MAC authentication, therefore, is 
   applied first by the receiver.  If the attacker is not a member of 
   the group, or otherwise has not obtained the group key, the MAC will 
   fail before the receiver incurs the burden of a signature 
   validation.  
    
   SrA transforms such as TESLA timed-MAC can be more efficient than 
   digital signatures for many applications. But like a digital 
   signature, it is REQUIRED that TESLA and other SrA transforms use 
   internal authentication in MESP and be protected by an external-
   authentication MAC.  Thus, a digital signature or TESLA MAC MUST be 
   applied prior to GA at the sender and after GA at the receiver.  
   MAC-based GA is an external-authentication transform that MUST be 
   applied last at the sender and first at the receiver.  As in ESP, 
   encryption (GS) is applied before any authentication and is 
   optional. 
    
3.2 MESP Security Association Database 
    
   The MESP framework applies up to three transforms to a multicast ESP 
   packet in the order described above: Group Secrecy (GS) is OPTIONAL, 
   Source Authentication (SrA) SHOULD be applied next, and Group 
   Authentication (GA) SHOULD be applied last.  The IPsec SAD MUST be 
   extended to store the additional transform information if MESP is to 
   be supported. 
    
   There are no changes to ESP SA lookup beyond what is specified for 
   multicast SAs in the IPsec specifications [AHbis, ESPbis].

   Encryption (ENC), when applied, covers the ESP data, padding and

   Integrity Check Value (ICV) field.   
    
   A sender MAY use an encryption-transform (ENC) as done in any other 
   ESP packet. 
    
   When INT is applied to the packet, its output (if any) is placed in 
   the Internal Authentication Tag.  Section 4.1 identifies the INT 
   transforms, which the sender MUST perform prior to the encryption 
   transform.

   A sender of an MESP packet SHOULD use an external-authentication 
   transform (EXT).  Section 4.1 identifies the EXT transforms, which 
   the sender MUST perform last (and the receiver performs first).   
    
   The sender MUST perform the MESP transforms in the order of ENC, 
   INT, and EXT while the receiver MUST perform them in the order of 
   EXT, INT and ENC. 
    
4.1 MESP Transforms 
    
   This version of MESP defines a minimal number of transforms.  In the 
   future, new transforms MAY be added through the publication of an 
   Internet RFC.  The transforms of the MESP framework are listed below 
   and classified according to MESP type. 
    
4.1.1 Group Secrecy 
    
   MESP supports 3DES, AES-CBC, and AES-CTR. 
    
4.1.2 Internal Authentication 
    
   MESP internal authentication is either RSA-SHA1 or TESLA. 
    
4.1.3 External Authentication 
    
   MESP external authentication uses HMAC-SHA1. 
    
4.2 MESP Signaling 
    
   MESP parameters are signaled through a key management protocol or 
   interface such as GDOI, GSAKMP, GKMP, or SDP. 
    
4.2.1 GDOI 
    
   GDOI MUST signal use of the MESP framework using PROTO_ESP_MESP with 
   the TRANSFORM ID set to the MESP transform ID value (see IANA 
   Section below).  MESP extends the RFC 2407 attributes ["IPsec 
   Security Association Attributes," IANA] with the three new classes, 
   "ENC_Transform, "INT_Transform," and "EXT_Transform" (see IANA 
   Section below). 
    
   The ENC Transform MUST be one of the transforms from 4.1.1.  
   Additional ENC transforms MAY be added to this suite through the 
   publication of an Internet RFC. 
    
   The INT Transform MUST be non-null and MUST be one of the values 
   from 4.1.2. Additional INT transforms MAY be added to this suite 
   through the publication of an Internet RFC.

   a digital signature algorithm.  The length of the encoding is 
   determined by INT. {Editor:  Need to define the Signature PubKey

5.0 Security Considerations 
    
   MESP is a framework for IPsec ESP authentication and encryption 
   transforms to support IP multicast delivery.  IPsec ESP provides 
   access control, rejection of replayed packets, confidentiality 
   (encryption), limited traffic-flow confidentiality and 
   connectionless integrity.  ESP supports a datagram environment where 
   each IP packet is cryptographically independent of other IP packets 
   and can be decrypted, authenticated, and integrity checked when 
   delayed, reordered, or when other packets from the flow are lost.  
   ESP provides rejection of replayed packets for pairwise security 
   associations and for multicast security associations under certain 
   circumstances [ESPbis].  MESP has the same replay mechanism for the 
   single-sender case; the multi-sender case is for further study.  ESP 
   provides data origin authentication for pairwise security 
   associations using symmetric message authentication codes, which are 
   not sufficient for group security applications where more than two 
   members share a symmetric key.   
    
5.1 MESP Authentication 
 
   The MESP framework for ESP provides data-origin authentication 
   services to multicast ESP packets.  Secure groups, such as secure 
   multicast groups, cannot use a symmetric-key MAC to uniquely 
   identify the sender; any group member that is in possession of the 
   group authentication key is capable of replacing the source address 
   of the packet with that of another group member and applying the 
   symmetric key to authenticate the packet.  To uniquely identify a 
   sender among a group of members, digital signature, public key 
 
 
 
Baugher, Canetti, Cheng, Rohatgi                              [Page 8] 
INTERNET-DRAFT               Multicast ESP                 March 2003 
 
 
   encryption, or specialized source-authentication techniques such as 
   timed MACs are needed. This version of MESP defines a general ESP 
   packet structure for accommodating a digital signature or TESLA 
   timed MAC. 
    
5.2 MESP Denial-of-Service Protection 
    
   As discussed above, a group member cannot authenticate the source of 
   the packet for a multicast group where multiple members share the 
   MAC key.  Thus, a rogue member of the group has all the keying 
   material needed to impersonate a sender of the group if that 
   attacker is able to inject packets into the network using that 
   sender's IP address.  The MESP framework addresses this problem by 
   augmenting the MAC with an "internal authentication" transform, 
   which MAY be an RSA-SHA1 digital signature or a TESLA timed MAC. 
   Digital signatures leave multicast receivers vulnerable to denial-
   of-service attack if the receiver is duped into performing 
   computationally-expensive signature validation of bogus packets.  An 
   external message authentication SHOULD accompany a digital signature 
   so as to limit the effectiveness of bogus digitally signed packets 
   by non-group members.  TESLA is also vulnerable to a denial of 
   service attack if the receiver is duped into storing bogus packets 
   awaiting MAC verification.  An external message authentication 
   transform SHOULD accompany a TESLA authentication transform so as to 
   limit the effectiveness of bogus TESLA packets by non-group members. 
    
   Unfortunately, group members are still capable of sending packets 
   with a valid external-authenticating MAC and invalid digital 
   signature, i.e. a group member can launch a DoS attack on the group 
   using invalid digital signatures.  And group members are still 
   capable of sending packets with a valid external-authentication MAC 
   but an invalid TESLA MAC.  In both the TESLA and digital-signature 
   cases, the external authentication will succeed only to have the 
   internal authentication fail.  MESP includes the ESP sequence number 
   in the internal authentication to protect against a replay attack by 
   a group member.  When the RECOMMENDED external authentication code 
   is use, however, the ESP receiver MUST validate both the internal 
   authentication as well as the external authentication before 
   updating the ESP replay window. 
    
   The value of MESP authentication transforms is to enable the 
   receiver to greatly reduce the effect of an attack by non-group 
   members, to reduce the effects of a denial of service attack by a 
   group member, to detect an attack by a group member, and to support 
   the integration of multicast source-authentication transforms into 
   IPsec ESP for data-origin authentication. 
    
5.3 MESP Encryption 
    
   The value of MESP encryption is to validate individual encryption 
   transforms for multicast operation.  It is possible that a 
 
 
 
Baugher, Canetti, Cheng, Rohatgi                              [Page 9] 
INTERNET-DRAFT               Multicast ESP                 March 2003 
 
 
   particular cipher and mode are suitable for pairwise security 
   associations but not for multicast security associations, such as 
   one where multiple senders share the key.  For example, a stream or 
   hybrid stream/block cipher has special risks of keystream reuse when 
   its key is shared by multiple senders.  Although IPsec encryption 
   transforms are generally suitable for multicast operation, many have 
   not been evaluated, tested or used in IP multicast environments.  
   This I-D has considered the suitability of several IPsec ESP 
   encryption transforms for inclusion in the MESP framework.  It is 
   RECOMMENDED that all future IPsec encryption transforms be analyzed 
   as to their security for multicast and group security as well as for 
   pairwise security. 
    
6.0 IANA Considerations 
    
   This I-D extends the RFC 2407 attributes for IPsec ESP, 
   PROTO_IPSEC_ESP [RFC2407]. Within PROTO_IPSEC_ESP, MESP reserves the 
   transform identifier value 13 [See IANA, "IPSEC ESP Transform 
   Identifiers"].  MESP also adds new type/length/value attributes to 
   RFC 2407.  For the MESP transform ID security association 
   attributes, the ENC Transform has type number 11, the INT transform 
   has type number 12, and the EXT transform has type number 13 [see 
   IANA, "Security Association Attributes"].   
    
         class               value           type

         ENC-Transform        11               B 
         INT-Transform        12               B 
         EXT-Transform        13               B 
    
   The ENC-Transform has the following values. 
         name                value   
         ----                -----

         AES-CTR               3 
    
   The INT-Transform has the following values. 
         name                value   
         ----                -----

         TESLA                 2  
    
   The EXT-Transform has the following values. 
         name                value   
         ----                -----
