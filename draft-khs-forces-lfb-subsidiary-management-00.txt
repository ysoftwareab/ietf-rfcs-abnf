   introducing and supporting virtualization of ForCES Network Element
   (NE) including control Element (CE) and Network Element (NE).

   Deployment experience has demonstrated the value of using ForCES to
   control the Forwarding Element Manager (FEM) by creating an LFB to
   represent its function using the same encoding rules as for any other
   LFB.  This allows it to be controlled by the same Control Element
   (CE).

   This work item assumes the presence of an initially booted FE whose
   configuration could then be updated at runtime via an FEM LFB for
   runtime config purposes (e.g., by adding a new CE and its associated
   IP address).

   This work item can also be useful in addressing control of virtual
   FEs where individual FEM Managers can be addressed to control the
   creation, configuration, and resource assignment of such virtual FEs
   within a physical FE.  This work would result in a standards track
   LFB FEM library RFC.

1.1.  Scope

   The scope of this document is discussion (and standardization) of
   utilizing virtualized NEs (VNEs)for virtual CEs (VCEs) and virtual
   FEs (VFEs).

   The currently existing techniques and solutions may be either slow or
   not directly applicable to ForCES LFB subsidiary management.

1.3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [6].

   The following definitions are taken from [7], [8] and [1].  They are
   repeated here for convenience as needed, but the normative
   definitions are found in the referenced RFCs:

   o  Logical Functional Block (LFB) -- A template that represents a
      fine-grained, logically separate aspects of FE processing.

   o  Forwarding Element (FE) - A logical entity that implements the
      ForCES Protocol.  FEs use the underlying hardware to provide per-
      packet processing and handling as directed by a CE via the ForCES
      Protocol.

   o  Control Element (CE) - A logical entity that implements the ForCES
      Protocol and uses it to instruct one or more FEs on how to process
      packets.  CEs handle functionality such as the execution of
      control and signaling protocols.

   o  ForCES Network Element (NE) - An entity composed of one or more
      CEs and one or more FEs.  An NE usually hides its internal
      organization from external entities and represents a single point
      of management to entities outside the NE.

   o  FE Manager (FEM) - A logical entity that operates in the pre-
      association phase and is responsible for determining to which
      CE(s) an FE should communicate.  This process is called CE
      discovery and may involve the FE manager learning the capabilities
      of available CEs.

   o  CE Manager - A logical entity that operates in the pre-association
      phase and is responsible for determining to which FE(s) a CE

      should communicate.  This process is called FE discovery and may
      involve the CE manager learning the capabilities of available FEs.

   o  ForCES Protocol -- The protocol used for communication
      communication between CEs and FEs.  This protocol does not apply
      to CE-to-CE communication, FE-to-FE communication, or to
      communication between FE and CE managers.  The ForCES protocol is
      a master-slave protocol in which FEs are slaves and CEs are
      masters.  This protocol includes both the management of the
      communication channel (e.g., connection establishment, heartbeats)
      and the control messages themselves.

   o  ForCES Protocol Layer (ForCES PL) -- A layer in the ForCES
      protocol architecture that defines the ForCES protocol messages,
      the protocol state transfer scheme, and the ForCES protocol
      architecture itself (including requirements of ForCES TML as shown
      below).  Specifications of ForCES PL are defined in [1]

   o  ForCES Protocol Transport Mapping Layer (ForCES TML) -- A layer in
      ForCES protocol architecture that specifically addresses the
      protocol message transportation issues, such as how the protocol
      messages are mapped to different transport media (like SCTP, IP,
      TCP, UDP, ATM, Ethernet, etc), and how to achieve and implement
      reliability, security, etc.

2.  Use of Virtualized ForCES Elements

   Virtualization of ForCES Elements allows efficient, scalabl, and
   robust utilization of network control and transmission resources.
   Virtualization has been discussed (and deployed) widely in the
   Computing Industry (e.g., server) in the context of efficient
   utilization of server resources.

   As mentioned before, the currently existing techniques and solutions
   may be either slow or not directly applicable to ForCES LFB
   subsidiary management.

2.1.  Use of Virtualized CEs

   In this section we discuss the use of virtualized ForCES control
   elements (CEs).  The resulting operating entities in virtualized
   environment are Virtual CEs of VCEs.  The CE Visor (CEV) has the
   visiblity to all of the VCEs in a domain, and can assign one of the
   VCEs as primary Master-VCE and another as secondary Master-VCE.  CEV
   can dynamically manage the role of primary and secondary master-VCEs
   from a pool of VCEs.

Internet-Draft    IETF ForCES LFB Subsidiary Management    February 2014


2.2.  Use of Virtualized FEs

   In this section we discuss the use of virtualized ForCES forwarding
   elements (FEs).  The resulting operating entities in virtualized
   environment are Virtual FEs of VFEs.  The FE Visor (FEV) has the
   visiblity to all of the VFEs in a domain, and can assign one of the
   VFEs as primary Master-VFE and another as secondary Master-VFE.  FEV
   can dynamically manage the role of primary and secondary master-VFEs
   from a pool of VFEs.

3.  Potential Scenarios

   In this section we discuss a few potential scenarios that can utilize
   ForCES LFB subsidiary management for efficient and robust operation
   of networks withut using excessive additional resources.

3.1.  Recovery from CE failure

   In this section we discuss how virtualization of CEs can be used for
   efiicient recovery from CE failure(s).

3.2.  Recovery from FE failure

   In this section we discuss how virtualization of FEs can be used for
   efiicient recovery from FE failure(s).

3.3.  Load Balancing

   In this section we discuss efficient load balancing of both CE and FE
   in virtualized environment.

3.4.  Scalable/Robust Service Function Chaining

   In this section we discuss how LFB subsidiary management can
   contribute to the robust/scalable implementation of Service Function
   Chaining (SFC).

3.5.  Orchestration

   In this section we discuss efficient Orchestration of both CE and FE
   in virtualized multi-admin-domain environment.

3.6.  Generic LFB Lifecycle Management

   In this section we discuss generic lifecycle management of
   subsidiaries of LFBs in virtualized environment(s).  The typical
   management activities in the life of FE/CE are discussed in the
   following sub-sections.

Internet-Draft    IETF ForCES LFB Subsidiary Management    February 2014


3.6.1.  Booting a CE/FE

   When an entity needs to boot a CE/FE, if this is a VM, some
   orchestration would scheme/plan to do this.  In case of ForCES, we
   have a control App that boots a CE or an FE via a management FE.  So
   here we have a management plane details that is described either in
   FEM or other LFB.

3.6.2.  Bootstrapping the Configuration

   The FE, e.g., the VM whihc has just been booted, as described in teh
   previous sub-section, needs initial bootstrap configuration (e.g.,
   what CEs to connect to etc).  This clearly falls in the FEM LFB
   domain.

3.6.3.  Runtime Management

   At runtime of the FE, for example, the management could introduce a
   new CE for the FE to associate with; it may also be for an FE to
   dissociate from a CE, and so on.

4.  Testbed Platform

   TBD.

5.  Reference Implementation

   TBD.

6.  FEM Library

6.1.  Frame Definitions

   This LFB does not define any frames

6.2.  Datatype Definitions

   This library defines the following datatypes.

                              FEM Data Types

6.3.  Metadata Definitions

   This LFB does not define any metadata definition

6.4.  FEM

   The LFB is an LFB that standardizes and assists creation of NEs.

6.4.1.  Data Handling

   The FEM LFB does not handle any packets.  It's function is to
   subsidize creation of NEs.  A CE or a CEM will request from the FEM
   the creation of the NE, it will provide the requirements, e.g. FEs,
   LFBs in FEs etc..., and depending on the implementation the FEM may
   create these FE instances, or if these instances exist, provide the
   bootstrap information to FEs how and where to connect to the CEs.

6.4.2.  Components

   This LFB has only one component specified.  The NEs component, is a
   component that contains all the Network Elements this FEM is

   responsible for maintaining.  It is a table and each row is a struct
   of the NEID, a uint32 and an array of FE parameters.

6.4.3.  Capabilities

   This LFB has no Capabilities specified.

6.4.4.  Events

   This LFB has three events specified.  These events notify the CE
   whether an NE has been added, deleted or changed.  The event report
   is the NEs row that created the event.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for ForCES LFB subsidiary management will be
   added in a future version of this daft.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  LFB Class Names and LFB Class Identifiers

   LFB classes defined by this document belong to LFBs defined by
   Standards Track RFCs.  According to IANA, the registration procedure
   is Standards Action for the range 0 to 65535 and First Come First
   Served with any publicly available specification for over 65535.
   This specification includes the following LFB class names and LFB
   class identifiers:

   +------------+---------+---------+----------------------+-----------+
   | LFB Class  |   LFB   |   LFB   |     Description      | Reference |
   | Identifier |  Class  | Version |                      |           |
   |            |   Name  |         |                      |           |
   +------------+---------+---------+----------------------+-----------+
   |     21     |   FEM   |   1.0   |    An FEM LFB to     |    This   |
   |            |         |         | standardize creation |  document |
   |            |         |         |  of ForCES Network   |           |
   |            |         |         |       Elements       |           |
   +------------+---------+---------+----------------------+-----------+
