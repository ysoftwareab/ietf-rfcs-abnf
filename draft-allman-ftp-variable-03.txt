Abstract
    
    The specification for the File Transfer Protocol assumes that the
    underlying network protocols use a 32-bit network address and a
    16-bit transport address (specifically IP version 4 and TCP).  With
    the deployment of version 6 of the Internet Protocol, network
    addresses will no longer be 32-bits.  This paper specifies
    extensions to FTP that will allow the protocol to work over a
    variety of network and transport protocols.

1.  Introduction
    
    The File Transfer Protocol [PR85] only provides the ability to open
    data connections on networks using the TCP/IP protocol suite
    [Com95].  FTP assumes network addresses will be 32 bits in length
    and the transport address (TCP port number) will be 16 bits long.
    
    Changes to FTP to support different network and transport protocols
    will be needed as new protocols are deployed (most notably, IPv6
    [DH96]).  RFC 1639 [Pis94] specifies extensions to FTP to enable its
    use over various network protocols.  While RFC 1639 allows for
    variable length transport addresses, it provides no mechanism to
    choose which transport protocol will be used.  The transport
    protocol is assumed to be based on the network protocol chosen.

    This document provides a specification which makes no assumptions

    regarding the underlying network and transport protocols.  In
    addition, protocol specification and encoding have been changed to a
    more human-readable format.  In this specification, the FTP commands
    PORT and PASV are replaced with EPRT and EPSV, respectively.

2.  The EPRT Command

    The EPRT command allows for the specification of an extended address
    for the data connection.  The extended address consists of the
    network and transport protocols as well as the network and transport
    addresses.  The format of EPRT is:

	EPRT <net-prot>|<trans-prot>|<net-addr>|<trans-addr>

    The <net-prot> and <trans-prot> arguments MUST be upper-case strings
    indicating the protocol to be used (and, implicitly, the address
    length).  This specification defines keywords for the following
    protocols:

	Network Protocols:
    
	    Keyword	    Protocol
	    -------	    --------
	    IP4		    Internet Protocol, Version 4 [Pos81a]
	    IP6		    Internet Protocol, Version 6 [DH96]
    
	Transport Protocols:

	    Keyword	    Protocol
	    -------	    --------
	    TCP		    Transmission Control Protocol [Pos81b]
	    RDP		    Reliable Data Protocol [PH90]

    Keywords for other protocols will be specified as needed.

    The <net-addr> and <trans-addr> are protocol specific string
    representations of the respective addresses.  The following are
    legal string representations of the addresses for the protocols
    defined above.

	Keyword	    Address		Example
	-------	    -------		-------
	IP4	    dotted decimal	132.235.1.2
	IP6	    IPv6 string		1080::8:800:200C:417A
		    representations
		    defined in [HD96]
	TCP	    string		6446
		    representation 
		    of decimal port 
		    number
	RDP	    string		3684
		    representation 
		    of decimal port 
		    number

    The <net-prot>, <trans-prot> and <net-addr> fields are optional.  If
    left blank, their default values are as follows:

	Field		Default Value If Omitted
	-----		------------------------
	<net-prot>	Network protocol of the control connection
	<trans-prot>	Transport protocol of the control connection
	<net-addr>	Network address of the control connection
    
    The following are sample EPRT commands:

	EPRT IP4|TCP|132.235.1.2|6275
    
	EPRT |RDP||5282

    The first command specifies that the server should use IPv4/TCP to
    open a data connection to the host "132.235.1.2" on port 6275.  The
    second command specifies that the server should use the network
    protocol and address used by the control connection to open an RDP
    data connection on port 5282.

    Upon receipt of a valid EPRT command, the server MUST return a code
    of 200 (Command OK).  The standard negative error codes 500 and 501
    [PR85] are sufficient to handle most errors (e.g., syntax errors)
    involving the EPRT command.  The response code 522 indicates that
    the server does not support the requested network protocol.
    Likewise, the response code 523 indicates that the server does not
    support the requested transport protocol.  The interpretation of
    these error codes is:

	5yz Negative Completion
	x2z Connections
	xy2 Extended Port Failure - unknown network protocol
	xy3 Extended Port Failure - unknown transport protocol

    The text portion of the response MUST indicate which protocol(s) the
    server does support.  If the network protocol is unsupported, the
    format of the response string MUST be:
    

	(prot1,prot2,...,protn) \
	    <text stating that the network protocol is unsupported>
    
    In this document, any text enclosed within "<>" is informational
    text which can be written in any language.  In the above case, the
    text should indicate that the network protocol in the EPRT command
    is not supported by the server.  An example response string follows:

	(IP4) Supported network protocols
    
    Similarly, if the transport protocol is not supported, the format of
    the response string MUST be:

draft-allman-ftp-variable-03.txt                       November 26, 1996

	(prot1,prot2,...,protn) \
	    <text stating that the transport protocol is unsupported> 

    where the protocols are identified by the keywords listed above for
    the EPRT command.  

    In the case when both the network and transport protocols specified
    in the EPRT command are unsupported, the error reported MUST be 522
    (unsupported network protocol).

3.  The EPSV Command

    The EPSV command requests that a server listen on a data port and
    wait for a connection.  The response to this command includes all
    information needed to setup a connection using the EPRT command.
    The response code for entering passive mode using an extended
    address MUST be 229.  The interpretation of this code, according to
    [PR85] is:
    
	2yz Positive Completion
	x2z Connections
	xy9 Extended Passive Mode Entered
    
    The text returned in response to the EPSV command MUST be:

        (<net-prot>|<trans-prot>|<net-addr>|<trans-addr>) \
    	    <text indicating server is entering extended passive mode>

    The portion of the string enclosed in parentheses MUST be the exact
    string needed by the EPRT command to open the data connection, as
    specified above.  An example response string follows:

	(IP4|TCP|132.235.1.2|6446) Entering Extended Passive Mode

    The standard negative error codes 500 and 501 are sufficient to
    handle all errors involving the EPSV command (e.g., syntax errors).

4.  Security Issues

    These FTP extensions increase the scope of the FTP "bounce attack"
    by making it possible for connections to be made using a transport
    protocol other than TCP.  A companion Internet Draft [AO96] is a
    more general discussion of FTP security issues and techniques to
    reduce these security problems.
    
5.  Conclusions
    
    The extensions specified in this paper will enable FTP to operate
    over a variety of network and transport protocols.
