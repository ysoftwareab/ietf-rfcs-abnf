                  Label Sharing for Fast PE Protection

Abstract

   This document describes a method to be used by VPN Service Providers
   to provide multi-homed CEs with fast protection of egress PEs. Egress
   PEs in a redundant group always share the same label in distribution
   of VPN routes of a VRF. A virtual Next Hop (vNH) in the IGP/MPLS
   backbone is created as the common end of LSP tunnels which would
   otherwise terminate at each egress PE. Primary and backup LSP tunnels
   ended at the vNH are set up by MPLS on basis of existing IGP FRR
   mechanisms. If the primary egress PE fails, the backup egress PE can
   recognize the "shared" VPN route label carried by the data packets.
   Therefore, the failure affected data packets can be smoothly rerouted
   to the backup PE for delivery without changing their VPN route label.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Label Sharing for Fast PE Protection     June 16, 2014


1. Introduction

   For the sake of reliability, ISPs often connect one CE to multiple
   PEs. When the primary egress PE fails, a backup egress PE continues
   to offer VPN connectivity to the CE. If local repair is performed by
   the upstream neighbor of the primary egress PE on the data path, it's
   possible to achieve a 50msec switchover.

   VPN routes learnt from CEs are distributed by egress PEs to ingress
   PEs that need to know these VPN routes. Egress PEs in a redundant
   group (RG) MUST advertise the same VPN route label for routes of the
   same VPN. When the primary egress PE fails, data packets are
   redirected to a backup egress PE by the PLR (Point of Local Repair)
   router, the backup PE can recognize the VPN route label in these data
   packets and deliver them correctly. The method developed in this
   document is so called "Label Sharing for Fast PE Protection".

   Figure 1.1: Egress PE routers share the same VPN route label 1100.

   An example topology is shown in Figure 1.1. Let PE1 and PE2 be
   ingress routers, and let PE3 and PE4 be egress routers. CE2 is
   connected to both PE3 and PE4 so they form an Redundant Group (RG).
   Usually, egress PEs may be configured to be in the same RG or
   discover each other from the CE routes learning process which can be
   a dynamic routing algorithm or a static routing configuration
   [RFC4364]. Suppose PE3 is the primary while PE4 is the backup. For
   topologies with more than two egress PEs in an RG, one PE acts as the
   primary while other act as backups. 

   A vNH node is created in the backbone. The primary PE allocates a
   loopback IP address to vNH (say 2.2.2.2). Instead of the egress PEs,
   vNH acts as the common end node of LSP tunnels which otherwise end at

   egress PEs. The metrics ('M' and 'S') for the links between egress
   PEs and vNH is set up in a way that the primary and backup LSP
   tunnels to vNH respectively use PE3 and PE4 as the penultimate hop.

   Egress PEs in an RG MUST advertise the same VPN route label for each
   VPN connected to this RG. When a route is learn from CE2 (say
   10.9.8/24), PE3 and PE4 will distribute this route to other PEs
   sharing the same label (say 1100). In this way, when the primary PE
   fails, the VPN route label carried with the rerouted data packets
   need not be changed. It can be recognized by the backup PE as well. 

   This document supposes BGP/MPLS IP VPN [RFC4364] is deployed in the
   backbone and Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is used to distribute
   MPLS labels. The approach developed in this document confines changes
   to routers in an RG. P and PE routers out of this RG are totally
   oblivious to these changes.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.3. Terminology

   VRF: Virtual Routing and Forwarding table [RFC4364]

   FRR: Fast ReRouting

   PLR: Point of Local Repair

   LFA: Loop-Free Alternate [LFA]

   RG: Redundant Group. A Redundant Group of Provider Edge nodes (PEs)
   to which a set of CEs are multi-homed.

2. The Virtual Next Hop

   A virtual router (the virtual Next Hop, vNH) is created in IGP to
   represent the RG in the Service Provider's backbone. For other
   routers in the backbone, the vNH acts as the common egress PE
   connecting a set of CEs. Multiple vNHs may be created for one RG.
   Then multiple paths can be computed from ingress PEs to the vNHs.
   Ingress PEs can choose from these paths to achieve load balance for
   the CEs.

   Service Providers may configure one PE to be the primary when an RG
   is created. The primary PE may also be automatically elected out of

   the RG in the same way the DR is selected (see section 7.3 of
   [RFC2328]), or the DIS is selected [ISIS]. Other PEs in the RG will
   act as backup ones. This primary PE determines the loopback IP
   address for the vNH. This loopback IP address can be configured
   manually or assigned automatically. The SystemID of the vNH under
   ISIS is composed based on this loopback IP address. The primary PE
   generates the router link state information (LSA/LSP) on behalf of
   the vNH. Links to each PE and each CE in the group are included in
   router link state information PDUs of the PE and CE.

   The overload mode MUST be set so that the rest routers in the network
   will not route transit traffic through the vNH. In OSPF, the overload
   mode can be set up through setting the link weights from the vNH to
   egress PEs to the maximum link weight which is 0xFFFF. In ISIS, this
   overload mode is realized as setting the overload bit in the LSP of
   the vNH. (See Appendix A and B for the detail set up of LSAs/LSPs.)

                    |<------ Sxy4-------->|

               Figure 2.2: The illustration of equations.

   If the IGP costs for the links between egress PEs and the vNH can be
   set up in a way that one egress PE appears on the primary path while
   the other PE appears on the backup path, the PLR can make use of the
   multiple egress PEs to achieve fast failure protection. Link weights
   can be set up according to the following rule in order to leverage
   the well supported [LFA] as the IGP FRR mechanism. 

   1. This document supposes bidirectional link weights are being used.
   As illustrated in Figure 2.2, assume the weight for the link between
   PE3 and vNH is "M" and the weight for the link between PE4 and vNH is
   "S". The weight for the link between PE3 and PE4 is C34.

   2. Px is a neighbor of PE3. This Px will act as the PLR. Suppose Pxy
   is Px's neighbor with the shortest path to PE4, after PE3 is removed
   from the topology. The cost of this path is Sxy4.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Label Sharing for Fast PE Protection     June 16, 2014


   3. Add PE3 back to the topology. The cost of the path from Pxy to PE3
   is Sxy3.

   4. "M" and "S" can be set up as long as the following two equations
   hold.

                          eq1: Sxy4+S < Sxy3+M

                             eq2: C34+S > M

   The eq1 guarantees that Pxy is safe, i.e., no loop occurs, to be used
   as the next hop by the PLR for bypass. The eq2 is designed to insure
   that the primary path does not go through the primary egress PE and
   backup egress PE in series. 

   Although this document designs the method based on [LFA] which is
   widely deployed, other IGP FRR mechanisms can also be utilized to
   achieve the protection. For example, [MRT] can be applicable
   regardless of how the link weights are set up.

4. The LSP Tunnels

   Egress PEs use the IP address of the vNH to identify the FEC. Its
   LSPs on basis of IGP routes with vNH as the last hop are set up using
   LDP:

     - The primary LSP tunnel follows the IGP route from ingress PEs to
       the vNH; 

     - The backup LSP tunnel is set up according to existing IGP FRR
       calculation, such as [MRT] and [LFA]. 

   Data packets are tunneled through the backbone using a "tunnel label"
   at the top of the label stack. Egress PE will not really transmit a
   packet to the tunnel end node vNH. Rather, they need locally deliver
   the packet. It can be interpreted that at the egress PE, the packet's
   next hop is the egress PE itself (see Section 3.10 of [RFC3031]). The
   tunnel label will be popped at the egress PE. The indication for
   popping is got from the tunnel label at the top of the stack since
   this is a label assigned to the FEC identified by the PE's loopback
   IP address. Next, there will be a pop of the VPN route label followed
   by an address lookup in the VRF. Section 5 will explain how to set
   the VPN route label in order to leverage these LSP tunnels to achieve
   the egress PE protection.

5. The VPN Route Label

5.1. Sharing the VPN Route Label

INTERNET-DRAFT    Label Sharing for Fast PE Protection     June 16, 2014


   In [RFC4364], egress PEs separately allocate and distribute the label
   for the route to an address prefix they learn from CEs. In this
   document, it's REQUIRED that backup PE(s) in an RG always advertises
   the label already advertised by the primary PE for the address prefix
   in question. The primary PE RG SHOULD distribute the same label for
   any address prefix in an attached VPN. This is per VRF label sharing.
   Others granularities, such as per address family per VRF label
   sharing, are also feasible. 

   Egress PEs continue to locally allocate VPN route labels so that the
   proposal need not modify existing forwarding processes of L3VPN
   egress PEs. At the backup egress PE, the allocated label and the
   distributed label would be inconsistent. The following two options
   arise to address this issue.  

5.1.1. Option A: Reserved Label Ranges per RG

   PEs in an RG are physically connected to the same set of CEs. It's
   viable for them allocate the same VPN route label per VPN. For each
   VPN served by an RG, the backup egress PE always allocates the same
   label as the primary PE. It acts as a 'compromised' network entity
   which always listens to the label advertised by the primary then
   allocates and also distributed the same label. By doing this, they
   are intimating the VPN route label allocation of the virtual node,
   vNH.

   For this option, PEs in an RG are REQUIRED to reserve the same label
   range(s) for allocation at the management plane. PEs with h/w
   disjoint label ranges are not qualified for this option. This option
   SHOULD only be used in well managed and highly monitored networks.
   It's not intended to be applicable when the RG spans more than one
   administrative domain. It ought not to be deployed on or over the
   public Internet. 

   Note that if one PE participates in multiple RGs, a label range
   reserved for one RG can't be used by another RG on this PE. It
   increases the consumption of labels on this PE. So this option should
   be deployed with care in this case.

   The architecture of the label sharing method allows a 'higher-layer'
   entity to allocate labels for all PEs across all RGs. This document
   leaves this choice as for future study.

5.1.2. Option B: The Label Swapping Table

                 Figure 2.3: The label 'swapping' table

   In the inter-AS L3VPN Option B defined in Section 10 of [RFC4364],
   when an ASBR distributes a VPN route to an ASBR in another AS, it
   need perform a label swap for this route. Similarly, the backup PE in
   this proposal uses a label swapping table to record the mapping
   between advertised labels and locally assigned labels for VPN routes.
   Obviously, the backup PE need maintain one such table per RG.
   Whenever a data packet to a route in a VPN attached to the RG arrives
   at the backup PE, the locally assigned label (e.g., 30) got from the
   swapping will be used in the VPN route label lookup followed by an
   address lookup.

5.2. Binding to LSP Tunnels

   When the VPN route with a shared label is distributed to other PEs by
   the primary PE and backup PEs, the BGP next hop is set to the IP
   address of the vNH. As defined in Section 4, LSP tunnels are set up
   for the FEC identified also by the IP address of the vNH. By doing
   this, the VPN route is bound to these LSP tunnels. When data packets
   to this VPN route are tunneled through the backbone, these LSP
   tunnels will offer the protection.

6. Examples To Walk Through

   Two examples are included in this section. Figure 1.1 is referred.
   The first one describes how to distribute VPN route label to peers.
   It's westbound in the control plane. The second one interprets how
   egress PE act in the case of the primary PE failure. It's eastbound
   in the data plane.

6.1. Label Distribution Procedure

   Assume PE3 is elected as the primary while PE4 is the backup. The
   loopback IP address of vNH is 2.2.2.2.

   1) PE3 learns the VPN route to address prefix 10.9.8/24 from CE2. It
      allocates the VPN route label 1100 and distributes it in BGP with
      2.2.2.2 as the BGP Next Hop. (prefix = 10.9.8/24|label = 1100|BGP

INTERNET-DRAFT    Label Sharing for Fast PE Protection     June 16, 2014


      Next Hop = 2.2.2.2)

   2) PE4 also learns the VPN route to address prefix 10.9.8/24 and
      allocate the VPN route label 30. It then waits for the primary PE3
      to advertise the VPN route label for this prefix.

   3) PE4 monitors the VPN route label 1100 from PE3 for the prefix
      10.9.8/24. The mapping from 1100 to 30 is inserted to the swapping
      table.

   4) PE4 distributes the VPN route using the monitored label 1100.
      (prefix = 10.9.8/24|label = 1100|BGP Next Hop = 2.2.2.2)

6.2. Protection Procedure

   Suppose the label for the primary LSP tunnel to vNH is 2100 while the
   backup LSP tunnel to vNH is 3100. P1 is the PLR. 

   1) In normal case, P1 sends data packets with tunnel label 2100 to
      PE3. When PE3 fails, P1 redirects data packets to the backup LSP
      tunnel (say P2-PE4-vNH) using tunnel label 3100.

   2) PE4 will receive a packet with two levels of labels. It pops the
      outer label 3100 and use this label to identify a swapping table.

   3) PE4 pops the VPN route label and looks up the swapping table. The
      VPN route label 1100 is mapped to 30.

   4) The VPN route label 30 is looked up in the VPN route label table
      followed by an address lookup in the VRF.

7. Operations

7.1. Label Space Management for Option A

   A label range should be reserved before an RG comes to operate.
   Operators need set a large label sharing space for label ranges
   reservation. When an RG is created, the operator needs reserve a
   unused label range for it. The label range should be reserved in a
   manner of 'enough is enough'. If a label range of an RG is being used
   out, the operator can reserve a new range from the unused label
   sharing space. The newly reserved range is then appended to the one
   being used out. 

   If a backup PE is partitioned from the primary PE, it continues to
   work with those allocated labels for the RG. However, it MUST NOT
   allocate any more labels in the reserved ranges. A label in a
   reserved range can only be allocated by a backup PE when it monitors

   that the primary PE has distributed this label. 

   When a primary PE resumes from a failure, its reserved label ranges
   come to work again. It SHOULD conserve the labels it allocated for
   each range.

7.2. Backup LSP Tunnel Exceptions

   The label sharing method requires that the backup LSP tunnel is set
   up as specified in Section 4, following the IGP route. However,
   Service Providers are allowed to have exceptions. For instance, an
   operator may use BGP Local_Pref to give a higher degree of preference
   to the route advertised by the primary PE. For another instance, the
   operator may have the primary PE advertise a more specific prefix.
   Take Figure 1.1 for example, the backup tunnel will actually goes
   through PE4->PE3->CE2 for both instances. When the VPN route is bound
   to this tunnel, it does not protect the primary egress PE. An alarm
   should be generated to notify the operator that such kind of
   configuration will jeopardize the VPN route's resilience to egress PE
   node failure.

      ranges between 1 and the value of ifNumber. The ifNumber equals to
      the number of the PEs in the RG. The PE with the highest priority
      sorts the PEs according to their unsigned integer Router ID in the
      ascend order and assigns the ifIndex for each. 

   Type
      Value 1 is used, indicating the router link is a point-to-point
      connection to another router.

   In the Variable Length Field, each link outgoing from the vNH to an
   egress PE is depicted by a Type #22 Extended Intermediate System
   Neighbors TLV [RFC5305]. The egress PE is identified by the 6 octets
   SystemID plus one octet of all-zero pseudonode number. The 3 octets
   metric is set as that in Section 3. None sub-TLVs is used by this
   version, therefore the value of the one octet length of sub-TLVs is
   0. The Type #22 TLV requires 11 octets.

   The Type #22 TLV is also included in the LSP of each egress PE to
   depict the incoming link of the vNH. Only the 6 octets SystemID is
   replaced with the SystemID of the vNH.
