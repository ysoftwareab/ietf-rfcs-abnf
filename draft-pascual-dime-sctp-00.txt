Internet-Draft              SCTP for Diameter              November 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Diameter base protocol [RFC3588] is intended to provide an
   Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) framework for
   applications such as network access or IP mobility in both local and
   roaming situations.  Among other aspects, [RFC3588] specifies the
   transport service used by all Diameter applications.
   [draft-ietf-dime-rfc3588bis] (work in progress) aims to obsolete this
   specification.

   Diameter messages are either requests or answers and are sent over a
   reliable transport that offers congestion control; hence in
   [draft-ietf-dime-rfc3588bis] the base Diameter protocol is defined to
   run over TCP [RFC793], SCTP [RFC4960] or TLS [RFC5246], assuming that
   TLS is run on top of TCP when it is used.  According to the same
   document, the use of a secured transport for exchanging Diameter
   messages is mandatory being TLS the primary method and IPsec a
   secondary alternative.  However, TLS over SCTP [RFC3436] has some
   serious limitations.

   This document updates [draft-ietf-dime-rfc3588bis] by specifying the
   usage of Diameter over SCTP and its associated security mechanisms.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC2119].

   The other concepts and terminology used in this document are
   compatible with [draft-ietf-dime-rfc3588bis],
   [draft-ietf-tsvwg-dtls-for-sctp], [RFC3436], [RFC3554] and [RFC4960].

3.  SCTP Usage

3.1.  Payload Protocol Identifier

   No SCTP identifier needs to be defined for Diameter messages.
   Therefore, the Payload Protocol Identifier in SCTP DATA chunks
   transporting Diameter messages MUST be set to zero.  [Editor's note:
   However, for protocol analyzers it is much easier if a specific PPID
   is used.]

3.2.  Mapping of Diameter messages into SCTP Streams

   Diameter messages need to be mapped into SCTP streams in a way that
   avoids Head Of the Line (HOL) blocking.  Among the different ways of

Internet-Draft              SCTP for Diameter              November 2010


   performing this mapping that fulfill this requirement, the simplest
   alternative is proposed; a Diameter entity SHOULD send every Diameter
   message (request or response) over stream zero with the unordered
   flag set.  On the receiving side, a Diameter entity MUST be ready to
   receive Diameter messages over any stream.

   Although both sides of the SCTP association SHOULD use stream 0 for
   Diameter requests and responses if they follow this recommendation,
   if a Diameter request arrives over a particular stream, the server is
   free to return responses over a different stream.  This way, both
   sides manage the available streams in the sending direction,
   independently of the streams chosen by the other side to send a
   particular Diameter message.  This avoids undesirable collisions when
   seizing a particular stream.

3.3.  Port Number

   The IANA has assigned port number 3868 for SCTP.

3.4.  S-NAPTR Parameters

   [draft-ietf-dime-rfc3588bis] registers a S-NAPTR Application Service
   Tag value of "aaa".  Additionally, it also registers the S-NAPTR
   Application Protocol Tag for SCTP: diameter.sctp

4.  TLS over SCTP Usage

   As exposed in [draft-ietf-tsvwg-dtls-for-sctp], TLS over SCTP
   [RFC3436] has some serious limitations.  In order to overcome these
   limitations, Diameter over DTLS/SCTP [draft-ietf-tsvwg-dtls-for-sctp]
   is proposed as an alternative to TLS/SCTP.

5.  DTLS over SCTP Usage

   DTLS over SCTP is described in [draft-ietf-tsvwg-dtls-for-sctp] and
   overcomes the limitations of TLS over SCTP.

   The IESG has recently approved DTLS over SCTP as a Proposed Standard
   and it will be published as a Standards Track RFC.  SCTP over IPsec
   is the RECOMMENDED solution for securing Diameter messages until
   DTLS/SCTP gets widely adopted by the industry.

5.1.  Payload Protocol Identifier

   No SCTP identifier needs to be defined for Diameter messages over
   DTLS.  Therefore, the Payload Protocol Identifier in SCTP DATA chunks
   transporting DTLS-based Diameter messages MUST be set to zero.
   [Editor's note: However, for protocol analyzers it is much easier if

   a specific PPID is used.]

5.2.  Mapping of Diameter messages into SCTP Streams

   Diameter messages need to be mapped into SCTP streams in a way that
   avoids Head Of the Line (HOL) blocking.  Among the different ways of
   performing this mapping that fulfill this requirement, the simplest
   alternative is proposed; a Diameter entity SHOULD send every Diameter
   message (request or response) over stream zero with the unordered
   flag set.  On the receiving side, a Diameter entity MUST be ready to
   receive Diameter messages over any stream.

   Although both sides of the SCTP association SHOULD use stream 0 for
   Diameter requests and responses if they follow this recommendation,
   if a Diameter request arrives over a particular stream, the server is
   free to return responses over a different stream.  This way, both
   sides manage the available streams in the sending direction,
   independently of the streams chosen by the other side to send a
   particular Diameter message.  This avoids undesirable collisions when
   seizing a particular stream.

5.3.  Port Number

   The port number [TBD] has been assigned for DTLS/SCTP.

5.4.  S-NAPTR Parameters

   [draft-ietf-dime-rfc3588bis] registers a S-NAPTR Application Service
   Tag value of "aaa".  The present document registers the S-NAPTR
   Application Protocol Tag for DTLS/SCTP: diameter.dtls.sctp

6.  SCTP over IPsec Usage

   When Diameter is used over SCTP over IPsec, two modes are possible.
   The straightforward way is to create an association and Security
   Policy Database (SPD) selector for each SCTP IP Address and port
   involved in an association, treating SCTP as any other layer above
   IP, and thus potentially creating multiple entries for a single SCTP
   association.  Implementations MUST at least support this
   straightforward mode, if they support this document and Diameter over
   SCTP over IPsec.

   Alternatively, implementations MAY also support [RFC3554] which
   provides a minor optimization to reduce the number of IPsec
   associations/selectors for SCTP connections.  Note that [RFC3554]
   creates a new IKE ID for this purpose.  Generally such an
   optimization is unnecessary for Diameter applications, both because
   of the relatively low number of Diameter connections per system, and

   because one of the main advantages of SCTP is multi-homing across
   interfaces which makes [RFC3554] potentially impossible to implement.

   TBD

   TBD
