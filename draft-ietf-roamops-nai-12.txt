     3.  Abstract

     In order to enhance the interoperability of roaming and tunneling ser-
     vices,  it  is desirable to have a standardized method for identifying
     users.  This document proposes syntax for the Network  Access  Identi-
     fier  (NAI), the userID submitted by the client during PPP authentica-
     tion. It is expected that this will be  of  interest  for  support  of
     roaming  as  well  as  tunneling.  "Roaming capability" may be loosely
     defined as the ability to use any one  of  multiple  Internet  service
     providers  (ISPs),  while  maintaining a formal, customer-vendor rela-
     tionship with only one.  Examples of where roaming capabilities  might
     be  required  include  ISP "confederations" and ISP-provided corporate
     network access support.

     4.  Introduction

     Considerable interest has arisen recently in a set  of  features  that
     fit  within  the  general  category of "roaming capability" for dialup
     Internet users.  Interested parties have included:

          Regional Internet Service Providers  (ISPs)  operating  within  a
          particular  state  or  province, looking to combine their efforts
          with those of other regional providers to  offer  dialup  service
          over a wider area.

          National  ISPs  wishing to combine their operations with those of
          one or more ISPs in another nation to  offer  more  comprehensive
          dialup service in a group of countries or on a continent.

          Businesses  desiring  to  offer  their  employees a comprehensive
          package of dialup services on a global basis.  Those services may
          include  Internet  access  as  well as secure access to corporate
          intranets via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), enabled by tunnel-
          ing protocols such as PPTP, L2F, L2TP, and IPSEC tunnel mode.

     In order to enhance the interoperability of roaming and tunneling ser-
     vices, it is desirable to have a standardized method  for  identifying
     users.   This  document proposes syntax for the Network Access Identi-
     fier (NAI).   Examples  of  implementations  that  use  the  NAI,  and
     descriptions of its semantics, can be found in [1].


     4.1.  Terminology

     This document frequently uses the following terms:

     Network Access Identifier
               The  Network Access Identifier (NAI) is the userID submitted
               by the client during PPP  authentication.  In  roaming,  the
               purpose  of  the  NAI  is to identify the user as well as to
               assist in the routing of the authentication request.  Please
               note  that  the  NAI  may not necessarily be the same as the
               user's e-mail address or the userID submitted in an applica-
               tion layer authentication.

     Network Access Server
               The  Network  Access Server (NAS) is the device that clients
               dial in order to get access to the network. In  PPTP  termi-
               nology  this  is referred to as the PPTP Access Concentrator
               (PAC), and in L2TP terminology, it is  referred  to  as  the
               L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC).

     Roaming Capability
               Roaming  capability can be loosely defined as the ability to
               use any one of multiple Internet service  providers  (ISPs),
               while  maintaining  a  formal,  customer-vendor relationship
               with only one. Examples of cases  where  roaming  capability
               might  be  required  include  ISP  "confederations" and ISP-

     INTERNET-DRAFT       The Network Access Identifier     7 November 1998


               provided corporate network access support.

     Tunneling Service
               A tunneling service is any network service enabled  by  tun-
               neling  protocols  such as PPTP, L2F, L2TP, and IPSEC tunnel
               mode.  One example of a tunneling service is  secure  access
               to  corporate intranets via a Virtual Private Network (VPN).


     4.2.  Requirements language

     In  this  document,  the  key  words  "MAY",  "MUST,    "MUST    NOT",
     "optional",  "recommended",  "SHOULD",  and  "SHOULD  NOT",  are to be
     interpreted as described in [9].


     4.3.  Purpose

     As described in [1], there are now a number of  services  implementing
     dialup  roaming, and the number of Internet Service Providers involved
     in roaming consortia is increasing rapidly.

     In order to be able to offer roaming capability, one of  the  require-
     ments is to be able to identify the user's home authentication server.
     For use in roaming, this function  is  accomplished  via  the  Network
     Access  Identifier  (NAI) submitted by the user to the NAS in the ini-
     tial PPP authentication.  It is also expected that NASes will use  the
     NAI as part of the process of opening a new tunnel, in order to deter-
     mine the tunnel endpoint.


     4.4.  Notes for Implementors

     As proposed in this document, the Network Access Identifier is of  the
     form  user@realm.  Please  note that while the user portion of the NAI
     conforms to the BNF described in [5], the BNF  of  the  realm  portion
     allows  the realm to begin with a digit, which is not permitted by the
     BNF described in [4]. This change was made to  reflect  current  prac-
     tice;  although  not permitted by the BNF described in [4], FQDNs such
     as 3com.com are commonly used, and accepted by current software.

     Please note that NAS vendors may need to modify their devices so as to
     support  the  NAI as described in this document. Devices handling NAIs
     MUST support an NAI length of at least 72 octets.


     5.  Formal definition of the NAI

     The  grammar for the NAI is given below, described in  ABNF  as  docu-
     mented  in  [7].   The grammar for the username is taken from [5], and
     the grammar for the realm is an updated version of [4].

     nai         = username / ( username "@" realm )

     username    = dot-string

     realm       = realm "." label

     label       = let-dig * (ldh-str)

     ldh-str     = *( Alpha / Digit / "-" ) let-dig

     dot-string  = string / ( dot-string "." string )

     string      = char / ( string char )

     char        = c / ( "\" x )

     let-dig     = Alpha / Digit

     Alpha       = %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z

     Digit       = %x30-39  ;0-9

     c           = < any one of the 128 ASCII characters, but
                    not any special or SP >

     x           = %x00-7F
                   ; all 127 ASCII characters, no exception

     SP          = %x20 ; Space character

     special     = "<" / ">" / "(" / ")" / "[" / "]" / "\" / "."
                    / "," / ";" / ":" / "@" / %x22  / Ctl

     Ctl         = %x00-1F / %x7F
                   ; the control characters (ASCII codes 0 through 31
                   ; inclusive and 127)

     Examples of valid Network Access Identifiers include:

          fred@3com.com
          fred@foo-9.com

     7.  Security Considerations

     Since an NAI reveals the home affiliation of a user, it may assist  an
     attacker in further probing the username space. Typically this problem
     is of most concern in protocols which transmit the user name in clear-
     text across the Internet, such as in RADIUS, described in [2] and [3].
     In order to prevent snooping of the user name, protocols may use  con-
     fidentiality services provided by IPSEC, described in [8].


     8.  IANA Considerations

     This  document  defines  a new namespace that will need to be adminis-
     tered, namely the NAI realm namespace. In order to to  avoid  creating
     any  new  administrative  procedures,  administration of the NAI realm
     namespace will piggyback on the administration of the DNS namespace.

     NAI realm names are required to be unique and  the  rights  to  use  a
     given  NAI  realm  for  roaming  purposes are obtained coincident with
     acquiring the rights to use a particular fully qualified  domain  name
     (FQDN).   Those  wishing to use an NAI realm name should first acquire
     the rights to use the corresponding FQDN. Using an NAI  realm  without
     ownership  of  the  corresponding  FQDN  creates  the  possibility  of

     conflict and therefore is to be discouraged.

     Note that the use of an FQDN as the realm name does not imply  use  of
     the  DNS  for location of the authentication server or for authentica-
     tion routing.  Since to date roaming has been implemented on  a  rela-
     tively small scale, existing implementations typically handle location
     of authentication servers within a domain and  perform  authentication
     routing  based  on  local  knowledge  expressed in proxy configuration
     files. The implementations described in [1] have not found a need  for
     use  of DNS for location of the authentication server within a domain,
     although this can be accomplished via  use  of  the  DNS  SRV  record,
     described  in [6].  Similarly, existing implementations have not found
     a need for dynamic routing protocols, or propagation of global routing
     information.  Note also that there is no requirement that the NAI rep-
     resent a valid email address.
