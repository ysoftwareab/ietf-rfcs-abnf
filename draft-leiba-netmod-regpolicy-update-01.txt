    Changing the Registration Policy for the NETCONF Capability URNs

Abstract

   The registration policy for the Network Configuration Protocol
   (NETCONF) Capability URNs registry, set up by RFC 6241, has turned
   out to be unnecessarily strict.  This document changes that
   registration policy to "IETF Review", allowing registrations from
   certain well reviewed Experimental RFCs, in addition to Standards
   Track RFCs.

Internet-Draft       NETCONF Capability URNs Policy         October 2015


   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Capability URNs registry
   [RFC6241], was set up with a registration policy of "Standards
   Action" [RFC5226], allowing registrations only from Standards Track
   RFCs.  This provided thorough review of the specifications that are
   requesting NETCONF Capability URNs.  It has turned out to be
   desirable to allocate capability URNs for certain Experimental RFCs
   also, provided those specifications are also carefully reviewed.  The
   existing registration policy is, therefore, unnecessarily strict,
   requiring exception handling by the IESG.  This document changes that
   registration policy to "IETF Review", which also allows registrations
   from certain well reviewed Experimental RFCs.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to change the registration policy for the Network
   Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Capability URNs registry to "IETF
   Review", and to add this document to the registry's reference field.

   Registrations made from RFCs that are not on the Standards Track need
   to be carefully reviewed through IETF Last Call and consultation with
   relevant working groups, such as NETCONF.  The Operations and
   Management Area Directors should confirm the appropriate level of
   review during IESG Evaluation.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document is purely procedural, and there are no related security
   considerations.

4.  NOTE

   [RFC Editor: Please remove this section and make sure the title of
   the references section is "Normative References".  The version of
   xml2rfc that I'm using ignores my section title and just calls it
   "References".]
