4.  Problem Statement

   This document addresses interworking issues between MPLS-TP network
   and IP/MPLS network.  The network decomposition can envisage network
   layering and/or network partitioning.

   The presented scenarios are not intended to be comprehensive, for
   instance more complex scenarios can be created composing those
   described in this document.


5.  Terminology

   As far as this document is concerned, the following terminology is
   used:

   o  IP/MPLS NE: a NE that supports IP/MPLS functions

   o  IP/MPLS Network: a network in which IP/MPLS NEs are deployed

   o  MPLS-TP NE: a NE that supports MPLS-TP functions

   o  MPLS-TP Network: a network in which MPLS-TP NEs are deployed

   o  Node: either MPLS-TP NE, IP/MPLS NE or CE

   o  Ingress direction: from client to network

   o  Egress direction: from network to client

   For each of the scenarios described in this document, two paragraphs
   may appear, one related to possible issues already envisaged by the
   authors (Open Issues), the other related to aspects still left for
   further study and/or definition (Open Points).

   This Section provides some terminology about network layering and
   partitioning.  Primarily source of those definitions is [ITU-T
   G.805].  Readers already familiar with these concepts can skip this
   Section.


6.  Elements used in the figures

   A legenda of the symbols, which are most used in the following
   Sections, is provided, in order to facilitate comprehension of the
   scenarios.

7.  Interconnectivity Options

   The MPLS-TP project adds dataplane OAM functionality to the MPLS tool
   set that permits executive action to be delegated to the dataplane.
   This provides the option of running MPLS without a control plane
   while still providing carrier grade resiliency options for connection
   oriented operation.  Connection oriented operation alone does not
   offer the scalability to offer contemporary multipoint service
   solutions, but the combination of MPLS-TP connection oriented
   backhaul and IP/MPLS service capabilities permits the deployment of
   networks that scale significantly beyond the boundaries of current
   control plane scaling.

   This section describes the methods in which IP/MPLS and MPLS-TP
   domains can interconnect.  The network decomposition can envisage
   network layering and/or network partitioning.  The presented
   scenarios are not intended to be comprehensive, for instance more
   complex scenarios can be created composing those described in this
   document.  The various elements introduced in this section will be
   referred to in later sections.

   The following figure illustrates the Network Layering concept, as it
   is described in Section 7.1:

   handle the technologies of both subnetworks.

   The two subnetworks are at the same level.  Some readers will also
   call this concept "Peer model".

7.1.  Network Layering model

   Two relationship are considered: the IP/MPLS network is carried over
   the MPLS-TP one, the MPLS-TP network is carried over the IP/MPLS one.
   This version of the draft focuses on the former relationship.  In the
   MPLS-TP architecture, the pseudo wire is the primary unit of carriage
   of non-MPLS-TP payloads.  This provides a clean demarcation between
   MPLS-TP operations and transported payloads.

7.1.1.  OAM Implication of the Layering model

   The overlay model has the virtue of uniform deployment of OAM
   capabilities and encapsulations at all MIPs and MEPs at a given layer
   in the label stack.  The IP/MPLS architecture does include OAM
   transactions originated by MIPs so the layer interworking function
   for MPLS-TP servers is simplified.

7.1.2.  Layering model control plane consideration

   The interworking between an IP/MPLS domain and an MPLS-TP domain
   highly depends on the implemented model (i.e. layering or
   partitioning) and different scenarios can be implemented depending on
   a number of different aspects.

   In the case of layering model, the first aspect consists on the
   provisioning of the LSP at the N-1 layer (MPLS-TP layer).  Two
   possible scenarios are foreseen: pre-configuration of the MPLS-TP LSP
   or induced provisioning.  The pre-configuration of the MPLS-TP LSP
   can be performed either manually via NMS or via the MPLS-TP control
   plane signaling and the MPLS-TP LSP can be exported to the IP/MPLS
   domain as a forwarding adjacency.  On the other side the signaling
   messages at the IP/MPLS layer, upon reaching the border of the
   MPLS-TP domain, can induce the signaling of the MPLS-TP LSP via
   RSVP-TE.  Other use cases depend on how the IP/MPLS is carried over
   the MPLS-TP domain and are analyzed scenario by scenario in the
   following sections.

7.2.  Network Layering scenarios

7.2.1.  Port based transparent transport of IP/MPLS

   This scenario foresees an IP/MPLS network carried over an MPLS-TP
   network.  The selection of the route over the MPLS-TP network is done

   on a per port basis.  The interworking is done via Link Layer (e.g.
   Ethernet) encapsulation in PW over MPLS-TP (as per PWE3 Protocol
   Stack Reference Model).  MPLS-TP LSPs are pre-configured with respect
   to IP/MPLS LSPs and IP/MPLS LSRs may be seen one hop away.

   The following figure illustrates the functional interworking among
   the networks:

   The LSR 3 and 7 are one hop away from the IP/MPLS layer point of
   view, CP/MP of IP/MPLS is transparently transported by MPLS-TP
   network.

   In case the Link Layer is Ethernet, the service provided by the
   MPLS-TP network could be an E-Line service realized via VPWS.  The
   LER4 and 6 do not need to know that above the Ethernet layer there is
   an MPLS LSP.

      (1) Physical level OAM (MAY be of several kinds)

   In case of fault detected at the MPLS-TP LSP (2) level, the
   corresponding server MEP asserts a signal fail condition and notifies
   that to the co-located MPLS-TP client/server adaptation function
   which then generates OAM packets with AIS information in the
   downstream direction to allow the suppression of secondary alarms at
   the MPLS-TP MEP in the client (sub-) layer, which in this example
   correspond to PW layer (3).

   Note that the OAM layers not directly related to MPLS-TP network have
   been reported just for completeness of the scenario; however their
   behavior and interworking are out of scope of this document.  For
   MPLS-TP Alarm reporting detailed description, please refer to
   [draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework].

7.2.1.2.  Control Plane considerations

   In this case the interconnection between the IP/MPLS domain and the
   MPLS-TP domain consists of a link.  This does not allow a transparent
   transport of the IP control messages (e.g.  LDP) over the MPLS-TP
   LSPs due to the fact that the egress node of the MPLS-TP domain is
   not able to route IP packets on its interfaces.  The IP control
   messages need to be carried over an Ethernet frame over a PWE3 before
   being injected into the MPLS-TP LSP.  In other words they are
   forwarded with two labels, the PWE3 one (S=0) and the LSP one (S=1).
   The IP control message, upon reaching the egress LER of the MPLS-TP
   domain, can be correctly forwarded to the ingress node of the IP/MPLS
   domain.

7.2.1.3.  Services view

   There are two service models supported by the overlay model when
   combined with Ethernet PWs.  The first is simple p2p encapsulation
   and transport of all traffic presented to the MPLS-TP on a given
   interface.  This is of limited utility due to the number of ports
   required to achieve the desired level of network interconnect across
   the MPLS-TP core.

   The second is that the MPLS-TP LER maps VLANs to distinct PWs such
   that multiple IP/MPLS adjacencies can be supported over each
   interface between the IP/MPLS LSR and the MPLS-TP LER.  This
   potentially can require a large number of IP/MPLS adjacencies
   overlaying the core.

   In both cases the service can be unprotected or protected.

Internet-Draft  draft-martinotti-mpls-tp-interworking-02       June 2011


7.2.1.4.  Resiliency considerations

   In the scenario where the service is unprotected, resiliency is fully
   delegated to the IP/MPLS network, which will depend on a combination
   of routing convergence and/or FRR to maintain service.  This will be
   at the expense of routing stability.

   A protected service can offer significant improvements in routing
   stability with the exception that the link between the IP/MPLS LSRs
   and the MPLS-TP LERs and the MPLS-TP LERs themselves are single
   points of failure.  There is an advantage in that the single points
   of failures are adjacent to the MPLS LSRs such that there is a high
   probability of such failures manifesting themselves immediately in
   the form of a physical layer loss-of-signal failure and thus
   accelerating recovery.  Multiple failure scenarios may also result in
   the IP/MPLS overlay having to take action to recover connectivity but
   this would be gated by whatever OAM detection mechanisms were
   employed by the IP/MPLS layer as there is no equivalent of MPLS-TP
   LDI across the interconnect interface.

7.2.2.  VLAN based transparent transport of IP/MPLS

   This scenario is analogous to the previous one.  The interconnection
   between the IP/MPLS LSRs and the MPLS-TP PEs is done via .1Q Tagged
   Ethernet, and VLANs are used to select the routes over the p2p
   Ethernet connectivity services over MPLS-TP (VPWS).  The interworking
   is done via Ethernet encapsulation in PW over MPLS-TP (as per PWE3
   Protocol Stack Reference Model).  This VLAN based interconnection may
   be used in order to reduce the number of physical interfaces between
   the two networks.  The same considerations of previous scenarios
   apply.

7.2.3.  Port based transport of IP/MPLS with Link Layer removal

   This scenario foresees an IP/MPLS network carried over an MPLS-TP
   network.  The selection of the route over the MPLS-TP network is done
   on a per port basis.  The physical interface between the IP/MPLS and
   the MPLS-TP network may be of different kind (e.g.  Ethernet, POS);
   the interworking is done via Link Layer removal and client packet
   (MPLS and IP) encapsulation in PW over MPLS-TP (as per PWE3 Protocol
   Stack Reference Model).  MPLS-TP LSPs are pre-configured with respect
   to IP/MPLS LSPs and are seen as routing adjacencies by the IP/MPLS
   network.

   The following figure illustrates the functional interworking among
   the networks:

       Port based transport with Link Layer removal - Networks view

                                 Figure 6

   The LSR 3 and 7 are one hop away from the IP/MPLS layer point of
   view.

   The service provided by the MPLS-TP network is p2p; client traffic is
   separated on a per port basis, so that (for example) all traffic
   coming from LSR 3 on the interface to LER 4 is transparently
   transported via LER 6 to LSR 7 and viceversa.  The client traffic to
   be encapsulated is both MPLS packets (DP) and IP packets (DP, CP and
   MP).  The encapsulation may be performed via PWs, that is, one PW is
   needed for MPLS and one for IP between any given port pair or
   directly using the LSP label stacking.  The encapsulation via PW is
   is required such that the IP/MPLS section preserves PHY like
   properties and to operationally isolate TP and IP/MPLS operation
   (e.g. reserved label handling link GAL and Router Alert).

      (1) Physical level OAM (MAY be of several kinds)

7.2.3.2.  Control Plane considerations

   In the case of transparent transport of the IP/MPLS over the MPLS-TP
   domain there are no differences, from a control plane point of view,
   with respect to the case of Ethernet encapsulation over MPLS-TP.
   Same considerations carried out in section 5.1.3.1.1.2 apply to this
   section.

7.2.3.3.  Services view

   The service model for the transparent transport mode is simple p2p
   encapsulation andtransport of all traffic presented to the MPLS-TP on
   a given interface.  This is of limited utility due tothe number of
   ports required to achieve the desired level of network interconnect
   across the MPLS-TP core.  It would potentially also requires a
   correspondingly high number of IP/MPLS adjacenciesto overlay the
   core.

   The service can be unprotected or protected.

7.2.3.4.  Resiliency considerations

   The resiliency considerations are the same as for the overlay model.

7.2.4.  IP/MPLS / MPLS-TP hybrid edge node

   In this scenario the physical interface between the IP/MPLS and the
   MPLS-TP network is generic and may be other than Ethernet (e.g.
   POS); the interworking is done via client LSP packet encapsulation as
   per MPLS labeled or IP traffic over MPLS-TP as per RFC 5921.  MPLS-TP
   LSPs are pre-configured with respect to IP/MPLS LSPs and are seen as
   routing adjacencies between the hybrid edge nodes by the IP/MPLS
   network.

   The service that is offered to the IP/MPLS network is that of a
   multi-point MPLS VPN.

   The following figure illustrates the functional interworking among
   the networks.

   Several levels of OAM are possible, a subset of them is shown in the

   them MAY be configured in a network.  A brief description of the
   levels is provided:

      (2) Edge-to-Edge MPLS-TP OAM on MPLS-TP network (at LSP level)

      (1) Physical level OAM (MAY be of several kinds)

7.2.4.2.  Control Plane considerations

   This case is different from the previous two because the
   interconnection between the IP/MPLS domain and the MPLS-TP domain
   consists of a node.  This lead to the fact that IP control messages
   do not need to be carried over a PWE3 along the MPLS-TP domain but
   can be directly carried over an LSP.  In other words they are
   forwarded with a single LSP label (S=1) and , upon reaching the
   hybrid node between the MPLS-TP domain and the next IP/MPLS domain ,
   the signaling can be carried on.

7.2.4.3.  Services view

   The service model for the hybrid edge node model is that the MPLS-TP
   network appears to the IP/MPLS network as a complete IP/MPLS



Martinotti, et al.      Expires December 9, 2011               [Page 17]

   subnetwork.  This has the virtue of collapsing the number of IP/MPLS
   adjacencies required to overlay the core.

   The service can be unprotected or protected.  And the protection can
   be a combination of MPLS-TP resiliency and IP/MPLS recovery actions.

7.2.4.4.  Resiliency considerations

   The resiliency considerations are similar to that of the overlay
   model.  However the extension of the control plane to the hybrid node
   means the lack of a dataplane LDI equivalent is mitigated, the IP/
   MPLS domain having been extended to reach the MPLS-TP OAM domain such
   that LDI indications from core failures can interwork directly the
   the control plane and accelerate recovery actions.

7.2.5.  MPLS-TP carried over IP/MPLS

   TODO

7.3.  Network Partitioning Model

   In the rest of this Section the following assumptions apply:

   o  Customer network is carried partly over IP/MPLS subnetwork (e.g.
      via PW encapsulation) and partly over MPLS-TP subnetwork.

   o  An example of server layer of MPLS is Ethernet.

   For the purposes of this Section, MPLS-TP subnetwork is deployed
   between a CE and an IP/MPLS subnetwork.  Other kinds of deployment
   are possible (not shown in this document), for instance:

   o  More than two subnetworks are deployed between the CEs

   o  MPLS-TP can be deployed between two subnetworks

7.3.1.  Connectivity constraints of the partitioning model

   The partitioning model is constrained to interconnecting LSPs or PWs
   with common behavioral characteristics.  As MPLS-TP is constrained to
   connection oriented behavior the portion of the LSP that transits an
   IP/MPLS subnetwork will need to be effectively constrained to the
   same profile, that is connection oriented, and no PHP or merging.  No
   ECMP or transit of LAG cannot be guaranteed which means OAM fate
   sharing may not exist in IP/MPLS subnetworks and the end-to-end OAM
   may only serve to coordinate dataplane resiliency actions between
   MEPs with respect to faults in the MPLS-TP subnetworks.

7.3.2.  OAM Implications of the partitioning model

   The partitioning model requires the concatenations of path segments
   that do not necessarily have common OAM components and have a number
   of possible implementations.  At the simplest level configuration of
   common OAM capabilities and encapsulation between the MEPs in the MEG
   is required.  The set that is common to the MEPs in the MEG may not
   necessarily be supported by the MIPs, and knowldege of MIP capability
   will not figure into MEP neogitation, so the MEPs may select a common
   mode that is not common with that supported by the MIPs.

   The primary consequence being that MPLS-TP MIP originated
   transactions, or messages targeted to MIPs using MPLS-TP
   encapsulations will not be guaranteed to provide a uniform quality of
   information as not all MIPs will support MPLS-TP OAM extensions, and
   as noted will not participate in MEP-MEP configuration or
   negotiation.

   This means that GAL encapsulated OAM may only serve to coordinate
   dataplane resiliency actions between MEPs with respect to faults in
   the MPLS-TP subnetworks and faults in the IP/MPLS subnetwork are
   recovered by IP/MPLS mechanisms (e.g.  FRR).  Edge to edge monitoring
   of MPLS/MPLS-TP networks may be implemented using an edge to edge LSP
   OAM/PW OAM, in order not to need a gateway/translation function on
   the border node between the two domains.

7.4.  Network Partitioning scenarios

   The main features to be taken into account in deploying a partitioned
   network are the following:

   o  Border Node or Border Link

   o  MultiSegment Pseudowire or LSP Stitching

   o  Network Interworking

   o  End-to-End OAM support

   o  Interaction between DP of IP/MPLS and DP of MPLS-TP

   o  Interaction between CP of IP/MPLS and MP of MPLS-TP

   o  Interaction between CP of IP/MPLS and CP of MPLS-TP

   o  Interaction between MP of IP/MPLS and MP of MPLS-TP

7.4.1.3.  Services view

   The generalized service model for all partitioning models is a p2p
   connection for the PW client.

7.4.1.4.  Resiliency considerations

   The PW can be configured to be protected or unprotected at the PW
   layer.  If it is unprotected it is dependent on the underlying
   domains (MPLS-TP or IP/MPLS) resiliency mechanisms to offer
   subnetwork protection, but the S-PE is a single point of failure.  A
   protected PW can be set up such that the working and protection PWs
   traverse physically diverse S-PEs.

   Implementing E2E protection at the PW layer requires CC flows on the
   PW which for large numbersof PWs may have scaling implications.

   When the PW is protected, the border node as an MS-PW stitching point
   permits the interworking of MPLS-TP fault indications with the PW
   signaling in the IP/MPLS domain such that fast E2E protection
   switching can be coordinated without requiring fast CC/CV OAM flows
   in the PW layer.

             Border Link - LSP stitching - Layers and OAM view

                                 Figure 17

   Note: in this case a SS-PW extends over the subnetworks as the
   stitched LSP does.  TCM can be used to monitor the LSP segments.

   Several levels of OAM are possible, a subset of them is shown in the
   previous figure, however these arenot comprehensive, any subset of
   them MAY be configured in a network.  A brief description of the
   different levels is provided:

      (4) Edge-to-Edge MPLS/MPLS-TP OAM on whole network (at PW level)

      (3) Edge-to-Edge MPLS/MPLS-TP OAM on whole network (at LSP level)

      (2) Edge-to-Edge MPLS OAM, Border MPLS OAM and Edge-toEdge MPLS-TP
      OAM on each network partition respectively (at TCM level)

      (1) Physical level OAM (MAY be of several kinds)

   TODO

7.4.4.3.  Services view

   The generalized service model for all partitioning models is a p2p
   connection for the PW client.

7.4.4.4.  Resiliency considerations

   The LSP can be configured to be protected end to end, have subnetwork
   protection or be unprotected at the LSP layer.  In the subnetwork
   protection scenario the border S-PEs and the borderlink are all
   single points of failure.

   When GAL/GACh encapsulated OAM is deployed at (a minimum) of the LSP
   MEPs, it is possible to envision interworking of the MPLS-TP LSP and
   LSPs in the IP/MPLS domain set up with RSVP-TE and/or with LDP.  In
   the latter case the MPLS-TP LSP maps to a FEC rather than a specific
   LSP but the MPLS_TP LSP would need to appear as a FEC in LDP with
   associated scaling impacts.

   Open Points:

   o  Edge-to-Edge LSP OAM (3) must be configured on different
      subnetworks

   o  Edge-to-Edge PW OAM (4) must be configured on different
      subnetworks

   o  Interworking between TCM OAM (2) and LSP OAM (3) is still to be
      cleared/defined

   o  Interaction between IP/MPLS and MPLS-TP CPs is still to be
      cleared/defined
