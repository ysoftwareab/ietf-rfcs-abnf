Internet-Draft      Conference List Event For SIP         January 2008 
    

   A new conference list event package is specified. This event package 
   allows a user to subscribe to a single event (the conference-list) 
   and receive notifications that contain the list of conferences to 
   which the user belongs and the status of each conference. The 
   notifications sent from the conference server can contain either the 
   entire list of the user's conferences or a partial list with the 
   updates since the previous notification.

1. Introduction 

   RFC 4575 [RFC4575] defines a SIP Event Package for Conference State. 
   Users can subscribe to a conference Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
   and be notified about their conference information.  
   The draft describes a new event package that allows a user to 
   subscribe to a conference-list. 
   By subscribing to the event package, a user can receive a list of all 
   relevant conference URIs (via the notification). 
   The user can then subscribe to each individual conference URI and 
   receive specific conference information (according to [RFC4574]).

Internet-Draft      Conference List Event For SIP         January 2008 
    

   The user will receive updates (via notifications) whenever there is a 
   change to the user's conference list. Examples of such changes 
   include the user joining a new conference, the user closing a 
   conference, etc. 
    
2. Requirements Terminology 

   Keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and 
   "MAY" that appear in this document are to be interpreted as described 
   in [RFC2119]. 
    

3. Usage Scenario 

   Users subscribe to the conference-list event package in order to 
   receive the most up-to-date information about their open and closed 
   conferences. This information can be received on any device from 
   which Users can subscribe. There are no restrictions regarding when a 
   device can subscribe to the service. Users can decide to add 
   additional UAs to subscribe to the event and get the most up-to-date 
   recent conference list status. Furthermore, users can switch between 
   different UAs and always get via notification the most updated 
   conference list, which they can then use to subscribe to a specific 
   conference Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and get additional 
   information (according to [RFC4575]). 
   As an example, User A can subscribe to the conference-list event 
   package as follows: 
    
   SUBSCRIBE sip:A@example.com SIP/2.0 
   Via: SIP/2.0/UDP x12.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKy5as148 
   From: sip:A@example.com;tag=146sa4 
   To: sip:A@example.com 
   Call-ID: 553223@x12.example.com 
   Max-Forwards: 70 
   CSeq: 10 SUBSCRIBE 
   Contact: sip:A@x12.example.com 
   Expires: 3600 
   Event: conference-list  
   Accept: application/conference-list+xml

Internet-Draft      Conference List Event For SIP         January 2008 
    

    
   The conference server SHOULD check and authorize the subscription, 
   and send the notification with the most updated conference list and 
   status: 
    
   NOTIFY sip:A@x12.example.com SIP/2.0 
   Via: SIP/2.0/UDP conference1.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKy5as148 
   From: sip:A@example.com;tag=151fd4 
   To: sip:A@example.com;tag=146sa4 
   Call-ID: 553223@x12.example.com 
   CSeq: 5 NOTIFY 
   Contact: sip:conference1.example.com 
   Event: conference-list 
   Subscription-State: active 
   Max-Forwards: 70 
   Content-Type: application/conference-list+xml 
   Content-Length: ... 
    
   <?xml version="1.0"?> 
      <conference-list xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-list" 
   version="1" state="full"> 
        <conferences resource="sip:A@example.com"> 
         <conference id="sip:conference_111@example.com" display-
   name="sip:conference_111@example.com" status="active"/> 
        </conferences> 
      </conference-list> 
    
    

4. Package Description 

   The Subscribe request with the conference-list event uses the same 
   header and structure as defined in [RFC3265].

Internet-Draft      Conference List Event For SIP         January 2008 
    

4.1 Event package name 

   A new event package is defined (as defined in [RFC3265]): 
   Event: conference-list  
     
4.2 Subscribe to conference-list event package 

   A user MAY subscribe from any UA to the conference-list event 
   package.  
   The new event package SHOULD NOT include any body in the Subscription 
   request. All other Subscribe operations (e.g. Refresh) are the same 
   as defined in [RFC3265].  
   Subscription authentication MUST operate to validate the Subscriber. 
   The Subscription authentication mechanism MAY operate as defined in 
   [RFC3261].  
   Authorization of the subscribing user in the conference server is out 
   of the scope of this draft. 
                       
4.3 Subscription expiration 

   The UA can subscribe with a defined expiration period to the 
   conference server. The subscribing UA MAY use the Expires header 
   field to determine the subscription period. 
    
4.4 NOTIFY Bodies 

   The conference-list notification body is an XML document that MUST be 
   well formed and SHOULD be valid.  The conference-list XML document 
   MUST be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded by using UTF-8. The 
   notify body structure and format is described by the XML schema in 
   Section 5. 
   The notification from the conference server contains a new Content-
   Type:  
   Content-Type: application/conference-list+xml 
    
   The XML structure below describes the new conference-list Content-
   Type body:

Internet-Draft      Conference List Event For SIP         January 2008 
    

   <?xml version="1.0"?> 
      <conference-list xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-list" 
   version="1" state="full"> 
       <conferences resource="sip:A@example.com"> 
        <conference id="sip:conference_111@example.com" display-
   name="sip:conference_111@example.com" status="active"/> 
       </conferences> 
      </conference-list> 
    
   The conference list notification can include a full or partial list 
   of URIs (in the state value). In case of state="full" the entire 
   conference list MUST be sent from the conference server to the 
   subscribed User. When state="partial", part of the conference list 
   MUST be sent from the conference server to the subscribed user.  
   The partial list SHOULD reflect the delta changes from the previous 
   notification. The first notification to a subscribed user MUST be a 
   full notification.  
    
   The "version" attribute is used to determine the sequence of 
   notifications to the subscribed user. The conference server MUST 
   increases the "version" for each notification within the same 
   subscription. 
    
   The conference "id" describes the User's unique conference Uniform 
   Resource Identifier (URI). The "status" value defines the conference 
   status - it may be "active" or "closed" (or any other status that 
   describes the conference state). A conference that a User joins will 
   have an "active" status. The status will be "closed" when a User 
   closes an existing conference and a conference-list notification will 
   be sent with the updated status value. "status" MUST be sent both in 
   "partial" and "full" notifications. 
   A "full" state will include only the conferences in "active" status 
   while the "partial" state MAY include "active" and/or "closed" 
   status. It is the responsibility of the UA of the subscriber to 
   represent the complete conference list and status to the user.  
    
   The display-name value MAY be included in the conference tag. The 
   display-name value MAY be a conference Uniform Resource Identifier

   (URI) or other textual informative string. This information MAY be 
   presented on the UI or may be used for any other purposes. 
    
5. XML Schema 

   The following is the XML schema for the application/conference-
   list+xml data format.  
   The notification body MUST follow below XML Schema format and 
   structure:

6. Example   

   In the following example, Bob subscribes to the conference server in 
   order to get the entire conference-list.  
        
   Bob SUBSCRIBE to conference-list 
    
   SUBSCRIBE sip:Bob@example.com SIP/2.0 
   Via: SIP/2.0/UDP x12.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKy5as148 
   From: sip:Bob@example.com;tag=146sa4

   Event: conference-list  
   Accept: application/conference-list+xml  
   Expires: 3600 
         
   The conference server responds "200 OK" to the conference-list 
   SUBSCRIBE request.
