1.  Introduction

   T1.X1 is the ANSI accredited T1 Technical Subcommitee responsible for
   developing SONET standards, including SONET rates, formats and
   payload mappings.  Its output is also brought into the ITU, for
   example as in ITU-T Recommendation G.707 [G.707].

   The IETF-recommended way to run HDLC over SONET is to use the
   definition found in T1.X1 ANSI documents [T1.105.02, T1.105] and ITU
   document [G.707].
