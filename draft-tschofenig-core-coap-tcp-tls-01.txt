A TCP and TLS Transport for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
               draft-tschofenig-core-coap-tcp-tls-01.txt

Abstract

   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has been designed with TCP as
   an underlying transport protocol.  The Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP), which has been inspired by HTTP, has on the other
   hand been defined to make use of UDP.  Reliable delivery, a simple
   congestion control mechanism, and flow control had been added to the
   CoAP protocol.  UDP is a good choice for networks that do not perform
   any form of filtering and firewalling.  There are, however, many
   deployment environments where UDP is either firewalled or subject to
   deep packet inspection.  These environments make the use of CoAP
   brittle.

   This document defines the use of CoAP over TCP as well as CoAP over
   TLS.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet protocol stack is organized in layers, namely data link
   layer, network layer, transport layer, and the application layer.

   IP emerged as the waist of the hour glass and supports a variety of
   link layers and new link layer technologies can be added in the
   future, without affecting IP.

   Combined with the end-to-end principle the hour glass indicates the
   level of protocol understanding intermediaries need to have in order
   to exchange forward IP packets between a sender and a receiver
   (absent any specific application layer entities, like proxies or
   caches).  Having IP as the waist meant that anyone could extend the
   layers above the network layer in the way they wanted to communicate
   end-to-end, including defining new transport layer protocols (as it
   was done with SCTP, and DCCP).

   Unfortunately, deployments departed from this ideal architecture.
   When the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] was
   designed it was assumed that many Internet of Things deployments

   would be clean-slate.  Today, we know that some deployments have to
   integrate well with existing enterprise infrastructure, where the use
   of UDP-based protocols is not well-received and firewalling use is
   very common.

   To make IoT devices work smoothly in these demanding environments
   CoAP has to make use of a different transport protocol, namely TCP
   [RFC0793] and in some situations even TLS [RFC5246].  This document
   describes a shim header that conveys length information about the
   included payload.  Modifications to CoAP are intentially avoided
   (e.g, to introduce optimizations).

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Shim Header

   This specification defines a simple layer necessary to convey length
   information about the exchange payloads in a 32-bit length field
   indicating the number of bytes in the payload following that header.


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                           Length                              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.  Developer Considerations

   The use of CoAP over a transport protocol offering reliable
   transmission already offers functionality that could be offered by
   CoAP itself.  While a developer can re-use an already existing CoAP
   protocol stack, the use of TCP makes some CoAP features redundant.

   Section 4.2 of [RFC7252] discusses the ability to convey messages in
   CoAP reliably as a "confirmable message", which always generates a
   response.  It can be used without harm but does not add any value
   since all messages would be transmitted reliably already thanks to
   the features offered by TCP.  A developer writing an application that
   runs CoAP over TCP or CoAP over TLS needs to be mindful about the
   changed semantic of CoAP.  For example, the marking the message as

Internet-Draft         TCP/TLS Transport for CoAP         September 2014


   non-confirmable (see Section 4.3 of [RFC7252]) does not make the
   transmission unreliable but it instead saves the transmission of one
   CoAP message.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines how to convey CoAP over TCP and TLS.  It does
   not introduce new vulnerabilities beyond those described already in
   the CoAP specification.

   When CoAP is exchanged over TLS port 443 then the "TLS Application
   Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension" [I-D.ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg]
   MUST be used to allow demultiplexing at the server-side unless out-
   of-band information ensures that the client only interacts with a
   server that is able to demultiplex CoAP messages over port 443.  This
   would, for example, be true for many Internet of Things deployments
   where clients are pre-configured to only ever talk with specific
   servers.

   When CoAP over TLS is used then the use of the shim header that
   includes the length information is redundant since the TLS protocol
   headers already include length information.  As such, the length
   header MUST be omitted when CoAP is exchanged over TLS.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests a value from the "Application Layer Protocol
   Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" created by
   [I-D.ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg]:

   Protocol:  CoAP

   Identification Sequence:  0x63 0x6f 0x61 0x70 ("coap")

   Specification:  This document.
