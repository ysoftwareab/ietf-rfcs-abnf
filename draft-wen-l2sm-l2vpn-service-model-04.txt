              A YANG Data Model for L2VPN Service Delivery
                 draft-wen-l2sm-l2vpn-service-model-04

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   a Layer 2 Provider Provisioned VPN service.

   This model is intended to be instantiated at management system to
   deliver the overall service.  This model is not a configuration model
   to be used directly on network elements, but provides an abstracted
   view of the Layer 2 VPN service configuration components.  It is up
   to a management system to take this as an input and use specific
   configurations models to configure the different network elements to
   deliver the service.  How configuration of network elements is done
   is out of scope of the document.

   The data model in this document includes support for point-to-point
   Virtual Private Wire Services (VPWS) and multipoint Virtual Private
   LAN services (VPLS) that use Pseudowires signaled using the Label
   Distribution Protocol (LDP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as
   described in RFC4761 and RFC6624.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model for Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN)
   service configuration.  This model is intended to be instantiated at
   management system to allow a user (a customer or an application) to
   request the service from a service provider.  This model is not a
   configuration model to be used directly on network elements, but
   provides an abstracted view of the L2VPN service configuration
   components.  It is up to a management system to take this as an input
   and use specific configurations models to configure the different
   network elements to deliver the service.  How configuration of
   network elements is done is out of scope of the document.

   The data model in this document includes support for point-to-point
   Virtual Private Wire Services (VPWS) and multipoint Virtual Private
   LAN services (VPLS) that use Pseudowires signaled using the Label
   Distribution Protocol (LDP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as
   described in [RFC4761] and [RFC6624].

   Further discussion of the way that services are modelled in YANG and
   of the relationship between "customer service models" like the one
   described in this document and configuration models can be found in
   [I-D.wu-opsawg-service-model-explained].  Section 4 and Section 6
   also provide more information of how this service model could be used
   and how it fits into the overall modelling architecture.

   in Section 5.

   The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
      denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

   Service Provider (SP):  The organization (usually a commercial
      undertaking) responsible for operating the network that offers VPN
      services to clients and customers.

   Customer Edge (CE) Device:  Equipment that is dedicated to a
      particular customer and is directly connected to one or more PE
      devices via attachment circuits.  A CE is usually located at the
      customer premises, and is usually dedicated to a single VPN,
      although it may support multiple VPNs if each one has separate
      attachment circuits.  The CE devices can be routers, bridges,
      switches, or hosts.

   Provider Edge (PE) Device:  Equipment managed by the SP that can
      support multiple VPNs for different customers, and is directly
      connected to one or more CE devices via attachment circuits.  A PE
      is usually located at an SP point of presence (PoP) and is managed
      by the SP.

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS):  A VPLS is a provider service
      that emulates the full functionality of a traditional Local Area
      Network (LAN).  A VPLS makes it possible to interconnect several
      LAN segments over a packet switched network (PSN) and makes the
      remote LAN segments behave as one single LAN.

   Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS):  A VPWS is a point-to-point
      circuit (i.e., link) connecting two CE devices.  The link is
      established as a logical through a packet switched network.  The
      CE in the customer network is connected to a PE in the provider
      network via an Attachment Circuit (AC): the AC is either a
      physical or a logical circuit.  A VPWS differs from a VPLS in that
      the VPLS is point-to-multipoint, while the VPWS is point-to-point.
      In some implementations, a set of VPWSs is used to create a multi-
      site L2VPN network.

3.  The Layer 2 VPN Service Model

   A Layer 2 VPN service is a collection of sites that are authorized to
   exchange traffic between each other over a shared infrastructure of a
   common technology.  This Layer 2 VPN service model (L2SM) provides a
   common understanding of how the corresponding Layer 2 VPN service is
   to be deployed over the shared infrastructure.

   This document presents the L2SM using the YANG data modeling language
   [RFC6020] as a formal language that is both human-readable and
   parsable by software for use with protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241]
   and RESTCONF [RFC8040].

   This service model is limited to VPWS and VPLS based VPNs as
   described in [RFC4761] and [RFC6624].

3.1.  Applicability of the Layer 2 VPN Service Model

   The L2SM defined in this document applies to both point-to-point
   (E-Line) and multipoint-to-multipoint (E-LAN) carrier Ethernet
   services.

   Over the past decade, The MEF Forum (MEF) has published a series of
   technical specifications of Ethernet virtual circuit service
   attributes and implementation agreements between providers.  Many
   Ethernet VPN service providers worldwide have adopted these MEF
   standards and developed backoffice tools accordingly.

   Rather than introducing a new set of terminologies, the L2SM will
   align with existing MEF attributes when it's applicable.  Therefore,
   service providers can easily integrate any new application that
   leverages the L2SM data (for example, a Service Orchestrator), with
   existing BSS/OSS toolsets.  Service providers also have the option to
   generate L2SM data for current L2VPN customer circuits already
   deployed in the network.

3.2.  Layer 2 VPN Service Types

   A Layer 2 VPN circuit can be port-based, in which case any service
   frames received from a subscriber within the contracted bandwidth
   will be delivered to the corresponding remote site, regardless of the
   customer VLAN value (C-tag) of the incoming frame.  The service
   frames can also be native Ethernet frames without a C-tag: in this
   scenario, only one Ethernet Virtual Circuit (EVC) is allowed on a
   single provider to subscriber link.

   Contrary to the above use case, incoming customer service frames may
   be split into multiple EVCs based on pre-arrangement between the
   service provider and customer.  Typically, C-tag of the incoming
   frames will serve as the service delimiter for EVC multiplexing over
   the same provider to subscriber interconnection.

   Combining the service-multiplexing attribute with the connection type
   (point-to-point or multipoint-to-multipoint), a Layer 2 VPN circuit
   may fall into one of the following service types:

   o  E-Line services: Point-to-Point Layer 2 connections.

      EPL:  In its simplest form, a port-based Ethernet Private Line
         (EPL) service provides a high degree of transparency delivering
         all customer service frames between local and remote UNIs using
         All-to-One Bundling.  All unicast/broadcast/multicast packets
         are delivered unconditionally over the EVC.  No service
         multiplexing is allowed on an EPL UNI.

      EVPL:  On the other hand, an Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL)
         service supports multiplexing more than one point-to-point, or
         even other virtual private services, on the same UNI.  Ingress
         service frames are conditionally transmitted through one of the
         EVCs based upon pre-agreed C-tag to EVC mapping.  EVPL supports
         multiple C-tags to one EVC bundling.

   o  E-LAN services: Multipoint-to-Multipoint Layer 2 connections.

      EP-LAN:  An Ethernet Private LAN Service (EP-LAN) transparently
         connects multiple subscriber sites together with All-to-One
         Bundling.  No service multiplexing is allowed on an EP-LAN UNI.

      EVP-LAN:  Some subscribers may desire more sophisticated control
         of data access between multiple sites.  An Ethernet Virtual
         Private LAN Service (EVP-LAN) allows multiple EVCs to be
         connected to from one or more of the UNIs.  Services frame
         disposition is based on C-tag to EVC mapping.  EVP-LAN supports
         multiple C-tags bundled to one EVC.

3.3.  Layer 2 VPN Service Network Topology

   Figure 1depicts a typical service provider's physical network
   topology.  Most service providers have deployed an IP, MPLS, or
   Segment Routing (SR) multi-service core infrastructure.  Customer
   Edge (CE) devices are placed at customer premises as demarcation
   points that backhaul in-profile service frames from the subscriber
   over the access network to the Provider Edge (PE) equipment.  The
   actual transport technology or physical topology between CE and PE is
   outside the scope of the L2SM model.

3.4.  Layer 2 VPN Ethernet Virtual Circuit Construct

   The base model of EVC is shown in Figure 3.

   Subscriber edge network device (C) connects to the service provider's
   CE equipment.  The link between C and CE devices is referred as the
   User Network Interface (UNI).  For clarification, this is called the
   UNI-C on the subscriber side and UNI-N on the provider side.

   The service provider is obligated to deliver the original service
   frame across the network to the remote UNI-C.  All Ethernet and IP
   header information, including (but not limit to) source and
   destination MAC addresses, EtherType, VLAN (C-tag), Class-of-Service
   marking (802.1p or DSCP), etc.

   In coming service frames are first examined at UNI-N based on C-tag,
   Class-of-Services identifier, EtherType value.  Conforming packets
   are then metered against the contractual service bandwidth.  In-
   profile packets will be delivered to the remote UNI via the Ethernet
   Virtual Circuit (EVC), which spans between UNI-N and UNI-N.

   When both CEs are located in the same provider's network, a single
   operator maintains the EVC.  In this case, the EVC consists only one
   Operator Virtual Circuit (OVC).

   Typically, the CE device at customer premises is a layer 2 Ethernet
   switch or NID.  A service provider may choose to impose an outer VLAN
   tag (S-tag) into the received subscriber traffic following 802.1ad
   Q-in-Q standard, especially when Layer 2 aggregation devices exist
   between CE and PE.

   The uplink from CE to PE is referred as an Internal Network-to-
   Network Interface (I-NNI).  When 802.1ad Q-in-Q is implemented,
   Ethernet frames from CE to PE are double tagged with both provider
   and subscriber VLANs (S-tag, C-tag).

   Most service providers have deployed MPLS or SR multi-service core
   infrastructure.  Ingress service frames will be mapped to either

   Ethernet Pseudowire (PWE) or VxLAN tunnel PE-to-PE.  The details of
   these tunneling mechanism are at the provider's discretion and not
   part of the L2SM.

   The service provider may also choose a Seamless MPLS approach to
   expand the PWE or VxLAN tunnel between UNI-N to UNI-N.

   The service provider may leverage multi-protocol BGP to auto-discover
   and signal the PWE or VxLAN tunnel end points.

   Nevertheless, the remote site may be outside of the provider's
   service territory.  In this case, the provider may partner with the
   operator of another metro network to provide service to the off-net
   location as shown in Figure 4.

   The first provider owns the customer relationship, thus the end-to-
   end EVC.  The EVC is comprised of two or more OVCs.  The EVC is
   partially composed of an OVC from local the UNI-C to the inter-
   provider interface.  The provider will purchase an Ethernet Access
   (E-Access) OVC from the second operator to deliver packet to the
   remote UNI-C.

   The inter-connect between the two operators edge gateway (EG) devices
   is defined as the External Network-to-Network Interface (E-NNI).

4.  Service Data Model Usage

   The L2VPN service model provides an abstracted interface to request,
   configure, and manage the components of a L2VPN service.  The model
   is used by a customer who purchases connectivity and other services
   from an SP to communicate with that SP.




Wen, et al.              Expires August 19, 2017               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


   A typical usage for this model is to be an input to an orchestration
   layer that is responsible for translating it into configuration
   commands for the network elements that deliver/enable the service.
   The network elements may be routers, but also servers (like AAA) that
   are necessary within the network.

   The configuration of network elements may be done using the Command
   Line Interface (CLI), or any other configuration (or "southbound")
   interface such as NETCONF [RFC6241] in combination with device-
   specific and protocol-specific YANG models.

   This way of using the service model is illustrated in Figure 5 and
   described in more detail in [I-D.wu-opsawg-service-model-explained].
   The usage of this service model is not limited to this example: it
   can be used by any component of the management system, but not
   directly by network elements.

   The usage and structure of this model should be compared to the Layer
   3 VPN service model defined in [I-D.ietf-l3sm-l3vpn-service-model].

   Additionally, this data model can be compared with the service
   delivery models described in [I-D.ietf-bess-l2vpn-yang] and
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-yang] as discussed in Section 6.

5.  Design of the Data Model

   The YANG module is divided in three main containers: customer-info,
   vpn-services, and sites.

   The customer-info defines global parameters for a specific customer.

   The vpn-svc container under vpn-services defines global parameters
   for the VPN service for a specific customer.

   A site contains at least one port (i.e., ports providing access to
   the sites defined in Section 5.1.3.1.8) and there may be multiple

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


   ports in case of multihoming.  The site to port attachment is done
   through a bearer with a Layer 2 connection on top.  The bearer refers
   to properties of the attachment that are below layer 2 while the
   connection refers to layer 2 protocol oriented properties.  The
   bearer may be allocated dynamically by the service provider and the
   customer may provide some constraints or parameters to drive the
   placement.

   Authorization of traffic exchange is done through what we call a VPN
   policy or VPN topology defining routing exchange rules between sites.

   The figure below describe the overall structure of the YANG module:

5.1.  Overview of Main Components of the Model

   The L2SM model is structured in a way that allows the provider to
   list multiple circuits of various service types for the same
   subscriber.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


5.1.1.  Customer Information

   The "customer-info" container contains essential information to
   identify the subscriber.

   "customer-account-number" is an internal alphanumerical number
   assigned by the service provider to identify the subscriber.  It MUST
   be unique within the service provider's OSS/BSS system.  The actual
   format depends on the system tool the provider uses. "customer-name"
   is in a more readable form.

   The subscriber operation center and main contact number are also
   listed here for reference purpose.

5.1.2.  VPN Service Overview

   A vpn-service list item contains generic informations about the VPN
   service.  The vpn-id of the vpn-service refers to an internal
   reference for this VPN service.  This identifier is purely internal
   to the organization responsible for the VPN service.

   A vpn-service is composed of some characteristics:

   Service Type (vpn-type):  Used to indicate service Type.  The
      identifier is a string allowing to any encoding for the local
      administration of the VPN service.

   Ethernet Connection Service Type (eth-svc-type):  used to identify
      supported Ethernet Connection Service Types.

    Cloud Access (cloud-access):  All sites in the L2VPN MUST be
      authorized to access to the cloud.The cloud-access container
      provides parameters for authorization rules.  A cloud identifier
      is used to reference the target service.  This identifier is local
      to each administration.

   Service Topology (svc-topo):  Used to identify the type of VPN
      service topology is required for configuration.

   Metro Network Partition:  Used by service provide to divide the
      network into several administrative domains.

   VPN Signaling (vpn-signaling-option):  Defines which protocol or
      signaling must be activated between the subscriber and the
      provider.

   Load Balance (load-balance-option):  Intended to capture the load-
      balance agreement between the subscriber and provider.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


   SVLAN ID Ethernet Tag:  Used to identify the service-wide "normalized
      S-tag".

   CVLAN ID To EVC MAP:  Contains the list of customer vlans to the
      service mapping in a free-form format.  In most cases, this will
      be the VLAN access-list for the inner 802.1q tags.

   Service Level MAC Limit:  Contains the subscriber MAC address limit
      and exceeding action information.

   Service Protection (svc-protection):  Capture the desired service
      protection agreement between subscriber and provider.

5.1.2.1.  Service Type

   The "svc-type" supports two service types: one for EVC (Ethernet
   Virtual Connection) and the other for OVC (Operator Virtual
   Connection).  These two parameters are not mutually exclusive.
   Depending on the service-type, a Layer 2 VPN service may be
   identified by EVCtype, OVCtype, or both.  E-Line and E-LAN providers
   shall have an EVC-ID assigned to the UNI-to-UNI circuit.  If the
   service has remote UNIs in an off-net partner's network, there will
   be one OVC-ID for the on-net segment between the local UNI and the
   E-NNI interconnect, and one OVC-ID for each off-net segment from
   E-NNI to the remote UNI.

   E-Access, on the other hand, is an OVC-based service.  The E-Access
   service provider will assign an OVC-ID for the circuit between UNI
   and E-NNI.

   New service types could be added by augmentation.

5.1.2.1.1.  EVC

   The "evc" case contains an "evc-id" leaf and "uni-list" container.
   And the "vpn-id" will be associated with the "evc-id".  Only one
   "evc-id" is allowed for each "vpn-id".  The "evc-id" leaf will be
   specified for E-Line and E-LAN service types.  "uni-list" will
   specify the UNI list associated with the same EVC service.

   The EVC-ID is intended to be a structured string.  Each service
   provider can decide the nomenclature in its network.  In addition,
   "number of PEs" and "number of sites" can be specified under the
   "evc" container.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


5.1.2.1.2.  OVC

   The "ovc" case contains "ovc-list".  For each "ovc-list" entry, there
   are two boolean subcases ("on-net" and "off-net") and one "ovc-id"
   leaf is specified.

   For E-Access or services with off-net UNIs, the "on-net" leaf MUST be
   marked TRUE, and the "ovc-id" will be specified.

   In case of E-Access, the "vpn-id" will be associated with the on-net
   "ovc-id".  Only one on-net "ovc-id" is allowed for each "vpn-id".

   If the service is E-Line or E-LAN with remote UNIs, there will be
   one, and only one, on-net "ovc-id" and a list of off-net "ovc-id"
   objects for the remote UNIs.  However, the "vpn-id" is still
   associated with the "evc-id".  Only one "evc-id" is allowed for each
   "vpn-id".

5.1.2.2.  Ethernet Connection Service Type

   The "ethernet-svc-type" group contains all supported Ethernet
   connection service types.  One, and only one, "ethernet-svc-type" is
   selected for each "vpn-id".

   The currently supported Ethernet Connection service types are listed
   in Section 3.2.  New Ethernet Connection service types can be added
   in the future.

5.1.2.3.  VPN Service Topology

   The type of VPN service topology can be used for configuration if
   needed.  The module currently supports: any-to-any, hub and spoke
   (where hubs can exchange traffic), and hub and spoke disjoint (where
   hubs cannot exchange traffic).  New topologies could be added by
   augmentation.  By default, the any-to-any VPN service topology is
   used.

5.1.2.4.  Cloud Access

   This model provides cloud access configuration through the cloud-
   access container.  The usage of cloud-access is targeted for public
   cloud and Internet Access.  The cloud-access container provides
   parameters for authorization rules.

   Private cloud access may be addressed through the site contianer as
   described in Section 5.1.3 with the use consistent with sites of type
   E-NNI.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


   A cloud identifier is used to reference the target service.  This
   identifier is local to each administration.

5.1.2.5.  Metro Network Partition

   Some service providers may divide their networks into multiple
   administrative domains.  And a Layer 2 VPN service may span across
   more than one metro network belonging to the same service provider.
   The optional "metro-network-id" container is intended be used by
   these multi-domain providers to differentiate intra-market versus
   inter-market services.

   When the "inter-mkt-service" leaf is marked TRUE, multiple associated
   "metro-mkt-id"s will be listed.  Otherwise, the service is intra-
   domain and only one "metro-mkt-id" is allowed.

5.1.2.6.  Load Balance Option

   As the subscribers start to deploy more 10G or 100G Ethernet
   equipment in their network, the demand for high bandwidth Ethernet
   connectivity services increases.  Along with the great revenue
   opportunities, these high bandwidth service requests also pose
   challenges on capacity planning and service delivery in the
   provider's network, especially when the contractual bandwidth is at,
   or close to, the speed of physical links of the service provider's
   core network.  Because of the encapsulation overhead, the provider
   cannot deliver the throughput in the service level agreement over a
   single link.  Although there may be bundled Nx10G or Nx100G
   aggregation links between core network elements, or Equal Cost
   Multiple Paths (ECMP) in the network, an Ethernet-over-MPLS (EoMPLS)
   PWE or VxLAN circuit is considered a single flow to a router or
   switch which uses the normal IP five-tuples in the hashing algorithm.

   Without burdening the core routers with additional processing of deep
   inspection into the payload, the service provider now has the option
   of inserting a flow or entropy label into the EoMPLS frames, or using
   different source UDP ports in case of VxLAN/EVPN, at ingress PE to
   facility load-balancing on the subsequent nodes along the path.  The
   ingress PE is in a unique position to see the actual unencapsulated
   service frames and identify data flows based on the original Ethernet
   and IP header.

   On the other hand, not all Layer 2 Ethernet VPNs are suited for load-
   balancing across diverse ECMP paths.  For example, a Layer 2 Ethernet
   service transported over a single RSVP signaled Label Switched Path
   will not take multiple ECMP routes.  Or if the subscriber is
   concerned about latency/jitter, then diverse path load-balancing can
   be undesirable.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


   The optional "load-balance-option" container is used to capture the
   load-balancing agreement between the subscriber and the provider.  If
   the "load-balance" Boolean leaf is marked TRUE, then one of the
   following load-balance methods can be selected: "fat-pw", "entropy-
   label", or "vxlan-source-udp-port".

5.1.2.7.  SVLAN ID Ethernet Tag

   Service providers have the option of inserting an outer VLAN tag (the
   S-tag) into the service frames from the subscriber to improve service
   scalability and customer VLAN transparency.

   Ideally, all external interfaces (UNI and E-NNI) associated with a
   given service will have the same S-tag assigned.  However, this may
   not always be the case.  Traffic with all attachments using different
   S-tags will need to be "normalized" to a single service S-tag.  (One
   example of this is a multipoint service that involves multiple off-
   net OVCs terminating on the same E-NNI.  Each of these off-net OVCs
   will have a distinct S-tag which can be different from the S-tag used
   in the on-net part of the service.)

   The purpose of the optional "svlan-id-ethernet-tag" leaf is to
   identify the service-wide "normalized S-tag".

5.1.2.8.  CVLAN ID To EVC MAP

   When more than one service is multiplexed onto the same interface,
   ingress service frames are conditionally transmitted through one of
   the EVC/OVCs based upon pre-arranged customer VLAN to EVC mapping.
   Multiple customer VLANs can be bundled across the same EVC.

   "cvlan-id-to-evc-map", when applicable, contains the list of customer
   vlans to the service mapping in a free-form format.  In most cases,
   this will be the VLAN access-list for the inner 802.1q tag (the
   C-tag).

5.1.2.9.  Service Level MAC Limit

   When multiple services are provided on the same network element, the
   MAC address table (and the Routing Information Base space for MAC-
   routes in the case of EVPN) is a shared common resource.  Service
   providers may impose a maximum number of MAC addresses learned from
   the subscriber for a single service instance, and may specify the
   action when the upper limit is exceeded: drop the packet, flood the
   packet, or simply send a warning log message.

   For point-to-point services, if MAC learning is disabled then the MAC
   address limit is not necessary.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


   The optional "service-level-mac-limit" container contains the
   subscriber MAC address limit and information to describe the action
   when the limit is exceeded.

5.1.2.10.  Service Protection

   Sometimes the subscriber may desire end-to-end protection at the
   service level for applications with high availability requirements.
   There are two protection schemes to offer redundant services:

   o  1+1 protection: In this scheme, the primary EVC or OVC will be
      protected by a backup EVC or OVC, typically meeting certain
      diverse path/fiber/site/node criteria.  Both primary and
      protection circuits are provisioned to be in the active forwarding
      state.  The subscriber may choose to send the same service frames
      across both circuits simultaneously.

   o  1:1 protection: In this scheme, a backup circuit to the primary
      circuit is provisioned.  Depending on the implementation
      agreement, the protection circuits may either always be in active
      forwarding state, or may only become active when a faulty state is
      detected on the primary circuit.

   The optional "service-protection" container is used to capture the
   desired service protection agreement between subscriber and provider.

   An "peer-evc-id" should be specified when the "protection-model" has
   been set.

5.1.3.  site

   The "site" container is used for the provider to store information of
   detailed implementation arrangements made with either the subscriber
   or peer operators at each inter-connect location.

   We are restricting the L2SM to exterior interfaces only, so all
   internal interfaces and the underlying topology are outside the scope
   of L2SM.

   There are two possible types of external facing connections
   associated with an Ethernet VPN service.  These give rise to two
   different types of site at which the connection is made:

   o  UNI site: where a customer edge device connects to one or more VPN
      services.

   o  E-NNI site: where two Ethernet service providers inter-connect
      with each other.

   Most of the attributes of a site are common to the two typs of site
   and so are presented just once.  Divergences (that is, attributes
   that are specific to the type of site) are captured in type-dependent
   containers.  In the text that follows, the phrase "between the
   subscriber and the provider" is used to follow the more common case
   of a UNI site, but should also be taken to apply to "between two
   providers" in the E-NNI case.

   For each site, there are sub-containers to maintain physical link
   attributes, service frame and Layer 2 control protocol frame
   disposition, Ethernet service OAM attributes, and agreements for
   service bandwidth profiles and priority levels.

5.1.3.1.  Generic Site Objects

   Typically, the following characteristics of a site interface handoff
   need to be documented as part of the service design:

   Unique identifier (site-id):  An arbitrary string to uniquely
      identify the site within the overall network infrastructure.  The
      format of site-id is determined by the local administration of the
      VPN service.

   Site Type (site-type):  Defines the way the VPN multiplexing is done.

   Device (device):  The customer can request one or more customer
      premise equipments from the service provider for a particular
      site.

   Management (management):  Defines the model of management of the
      site, for example: type, management-transport, address.

   Location (location):  The site location information to allow easy
      retrieval of data on which are the nearest available resources.

   Site diversity (site-diversity):  Presents some parameters to support
      site diversity.

   Site signaling (signaling-options):  Defines which protocol or
      signaling must be activated between the subscriber and the
      provider.

   Load balancing (load-balance-options):  Defines the load-balancing
      agreement information between the subscriber and provider.

   Site Network Accesses (ports):  Defines the list of ports to the
      sites and their properties: especially bearer, connection and
      service parameters.

5.1.3.1.1.  Site ID

   The "site-id" leaf contains an arbitrary string to uniquely identify
   the site within the overall network infrastructure.  The format of
   the site-id is determined by the local administration of the VPN
   service.

5.1.3.1.2.  Site Management

   The "management" sub-container is intended for site management
   options, depending on the device ownership and security access
   control.  The followings are three common management models:

   CE Provider Managed:  The provider has the sole ownership of the CE
      device.  Only the provider has access to the CE.  The
      responsibility boundary between SP and customer is between CE and
      customer network.  This is the most common use case.

   CE Customer Managed:  The customer has the sole ownership of the CE
      device.  Only the customer has access to the CE.  In this model,
      the responsibility boundary between SP and customer is between PE
      and CE.

   CE Co-managed:  The provider has ownership of the CE device and
      responsible for managing the CE.  However, the provider grants the
      customer access to the CE for some configuration/monitoring
      purposes.  In this co-managed mode, the responsibility boundary is
      the same as for the provider-managed model.

   The selected management mode is specified under the "type" leaf.  The
   "address" leaf stores CE device management IP information.  And the
   "management-transport" leaf is used to identify the transport
   protocol for management traffic: IPv4 or IPv6.  Additional security
   options may be derived based on the particular management model
   selected.

5.1.3.1.3.  Site Location

   The information in the "location" sub-container under a "site" allows
   easy retrieval of data about which are the nearest available
   facilities and can be used for access topology planning.  It may also
   be used by other network orchestration component to choose the
   targeted upstream PE.  Location is expressed in terms of postal
   information.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


5.1.3.1.4.  Site Diversity

   Some subscribers may request upstream PE diversity between two or
   more sites.  These sites will share the same diversity group ID under
   the optional "site-diversity" sub-container.

5.1.3.1.5.  Site Security

   This sub-container presents parameters for ingress service stream
   admission control and encryption profile information.  It is also a
   placeholder for further site-security options that may be added by
   augmentation.

5.1.3.1.6.  Site signaling Option

   The "signaling-option" container captures service-wide attributes of
   the L2VPN instance.

   Although topology discovery or network device configuration is
   purposely out of scope for the L2SM model, certain VPN parameters are
   listed here.  The information can then be passed to other elements in
   the whole automation eco-system (such as the configuration engine)
   which will handle the actual service provisioning function.

   The "signaling-option" list uses the combination of "name" and "type"
   as the key.  The "name" leaf is a free-form string of the VPN
   instance name.  The "type" leaf is for the signaling protocol: BGP-
   L2VPN, BGP-EVPN, or T-LDP.

5.1.3.1.6.1.  BGP L2VPN

   [RFC4761] and [RFC6624] describe the mechanism to auto-discover L2VPN
   VPLS/VPWS end points (CE-ID or VE-ID) and signal the label base and
   offset at the same time to allow remote PE to derive the VPN label to
   be used when sending packets to the advertising router.

   Due to the way auto-discovery operates, PEs that have at least one
   attachment circuit associated with a particular VPN service do not
   need to be specified explicitly.

   In the L2SM model, only the target community (or communities) are
   listed at the service level.

   The "type" leaf under "mp-bgp-l2vpn" is an identityref to specify
   "vpws" or "vpls" sub-types.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


5.1.3.1.6.2.  BGP EVPN

   Defined in [RFC7432], EVPN is an L2VPN technology based upon BGP MAC
   routing.  It provides similar functionality to BGP VPWS/VPLS with
   improvement around redundancy, multicast optimization, provisioning,
   and simplicity.

   Due to the way auto-discovery operates, PEs that have at least one
   attachment circuit associated with a particular VPN service do not
   need to be specified explicitly.

   In the L2SM model, only the target community (or communities) are
   listed at the service level.

   The "type" leaf under "mp-bgp-evpn" is an identityref to specify
   "vpws" or "vpls" sub-types.

5.1.3.1.6.3.  LDP Pseudowires

   [RFC4762] specifies the method of using targeted LDP sessions between
   PEs to exchange VC label information.  This requires a configured
   full mesh of targeted LDP sessions between all PEs.

   As multiple attachment circuits may terminate on a single PE, this
   PE-to-PE mesh is not a per-site attribute.  All PEs related to the
   L2VPN service will be listed in the "t-ldp-pwe" with associated "vc-
   id".

5.1.3.1.6.4.  PWE Encapsulation Type

   Based on [RFC4448], there are two types of Ethernet services: "Port-
   to-Port Ethernet PW emulation" and "Vlan-to-Vlan Ethernet PW
   emulation", commonly referred to as Type 5 and Type 4 respectively.
   This concept applies to both BGP L2VPN VPWS/VPLS and T-LDP signaled
   PWE implementations.

   The "pwe-encapsulation-type" container contains two Boolean type
   leaves: "ethernet" and "ethernet-vlan".  If "signaling-option" is
   "mp-bgp-l2vpn" or "t-ldp-pwe", then exactly one of "ethernet" and
   "ethernet-vlan" MUST be marked TRUE .

5.1.3.1.6.5.  PWE MTU

   During the signaling process of a BGP-L2VPN or T-LDP pseudowire, the
   pwe-mtu value is exchanged and must match at both ends.  By default,
   the pwe-mtu is derived from physical interface MTU of the attachment
   circuit minus the EoMPLS transport header.  In some cases, however,
   the physical interface on both ends of the circuit might not have



Wen, et al.              Expires August 19, 2017               [Page 32]

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


   identical MTU settings.  For example, due to 802.1ad q-in-q
   operation, an I-NNI will need an extra four bytes to accommodate the
   S-tag.  The inter-carrier E-NNI link may also have a different MTU
   size than the internal network interfaces.

   [RFC4448] requires the same MTU size on physical interfaces at both
   ends of the pseudowire.  In actual implementations, many router
   vendors have provided a knob to explicitly specify the pwe-mtu, which
   can then be decoupled from the physical interface MTU.

   When there is a mismatch between the physical interface MTU and
   configured pwe-mtu, the "allow-mtu-mismatch" leaf in the "pwe-mtu"
   contained enables definition of the required behavior.

5.1.3.1.6.6.  Control Word

   A control word is an optional 4-byte field located between the MPLS
   label stack and the Layer 2 payload in the pseudowire packet.  It
   plays a crucial role in Any Transport over MPLS (AToM).  The 32-bit
   field carries generic and Layer 2 payload-specific information,
   including a C-bit which indicates whether the control word will
   present in the Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS) packets.  If the C-bit is
   set to 1, the advertising PE expects the control word to be present
   in every pseudowire packet on the pseudowire that is being signaled.
   If the C-bit is set to 0, no control word is expected to be present.

   Whether to include control word in the pseudowire packets MUST match
   on PEs at both ends of the pseudowire and it is non-negotiable during
   the signaling process.

   The use of a control-word applies to pseduowires signaled using
   either BGP L2VPN VPWS/VPLS or T-LDP.  It is a routing-instance level
   configuration parameter in many cases.

   The optional "control-word" leaf is a Boolean field in the L2SM model
   for the provider to explicitly specify whether the control-word will
   be signaled for the service instance.

5.1.3.1.7.  Site Load Balance Options

   See Section 5.1.2.6.

5.1.3.1.8.  Ports

   The L2SM includes a set of essential physical interface properties
   and Ethernet layer characteristics in the "port" sub-container.  Some
   of these are critical implementation arrangements that require
   consent from both subscriber and provider.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


5.1.3.1.8.1.  ID

   "id" is a free-form string to identify a given interface.  The
   service provider can decide on the actual nomenclature used in the
   management systems.

5.1.3.1.8.2.  Remote Carrier Name

   Remote Carrier Name is the Name of Remote Carrier associated with the
   remote end of an E-NNI and so only applies for that type of VPN
   connectivity.

5.1.3.1.8.3.  Access Diversity

   In order to help the different placement scenarios, a site-network-
   access (i.e., port defined in Section 5.1.3.1.8) may be tagged using
   one or more fate sharing group identifiers.  The fate sharing group
   identifier is a string so it can accommodate both explicit naming of
   a group of sites (e.g. "multihomed-set1") or a numbered identifier
   (e.g.  12345678).  The meaning of each group-id is local to each
   customer administrator.

5.1.3.1.8.4.  Bearer

   The "bearer" container defines the requirements for the site
   attachment to the provider network that are below Layer 3.

   The bearer parameters will help to determine the access media to be
   used.

5.1.3.1.8.5.  Ethernet Connection

   The ethernet-connection container presents two sets of link
   attributes: physical or optional LAG interface attributes.  These
   parameters are essential for the connection between subscriber and
   provider edge devices to establish properly.

   For each physical interface (phy-interface), there are basic
   configuration parameters like port number and speed, interface MTU,
   auto-negotiation and flow-control settings, etc.  "encapsulation-
   type" is for user to select between Ethernet encapsulation (port-
   based) or Ethernet VLAN encapsulation (VLAN-based).  All allowed
   Ethertypes of ingress service frames can be listed under "ethertype".
   In addition, the subscriber and provider may decide to enable
   advanced features, such as LLDP, 802.3AH link OAM, MAC loop
   detection/prevention at a UNI, based on mutual agreement.





Wen, et al.              Expires August 19, 2017               [Page 34]

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


   Sometimes, the subscriber may require multiple physical links bundled
   together to form a single, logical, point-to-point LAG connection to
   the service provider.  Typically, LACP (Link Aggregation Control
   Protocol) is used to dynamically manage adding or deleting member
   links of the aggregate group.  In general, LAG allows for increased
   service bandwidth beyond the speed of a single physical link while
   providing graceful degradation as failure occurs, thus increased
   availability.

   In the L2SM, there is a set of attributes under "LAG-interface"
   related to link aggregation functionality.  The subscriber and
   provider first need to decide on whether LACP PDU will be exchanged
   between the edge device by specifying the "LACP-state" to "On" or
   "Off".  If LACP is to be enabled, then both parties need to further
   specify whether it will be running in active versus passive mode,
   plus the time interval and priority level of the LACP PDU.  The
   subscriber and provider can also determine the minimum aggregate
   bandwidth for a LAG to be considered valid path by specifying the
   optional "mini-link" attribute.  To enable fast detection of faulty
   links, micro-BFD runs independent UDP sessions to monitor the status
   of each member link.  Subscriber and provider should consent to the
   BFD hello interval and hold time.

   Each member link will be listed under the LAG interface with basic
   physical link properties.  Certain attributes like flow-control,
   encapsulation type, allowed ingress Ethertype and LLDP settings are
   at the LAG level.

   If the Ethernet service is enabled on a logical unit on the
   connection at the interface, the "sub-if-id" should be specified.

   The "Ethernet-connection" container also presents site specific
   (S-tag, C-tag) management options.  The overall S-tag for the
   Ethernet circuit and C-tag to EVC mapping, if applicable, has been
   placed in the service container.  The S-tag under "port" should match
   the S-tag in the service container in most cases, however, vlan
   translation is required for the S-tag in certain deployment at the
   external facing interface or upstream PEs to "normalize" the outer
   VLAN tag to the service S-tag into the network and translate back to
   the site's S-tag in the opposite direction.  One example of this is
   with a Layer 2 aggregation switch along the path: the S-tag for the
   EVC has been previously assigned to another service thus can not be
   used by this attachment circuit.  Another use case is when multiple
   E-access OVCs from the same E-NNIs are attached to the same E-LAN
   service.

   The "svlan-id-ethernet-tag" in the "Ethernet-connection" container is
   either the S-tag inserted at a UNI or the outer tag of ingress

   packets at an E-NNI.  These parameters are included in the L2SM to
   facilitate other management system to generate proper configuration
   for the network elements.

   The "ethernet-connection" container also contains an optional site-
   specific C-tag to EVC mapping.

5.1.3.1.8.6.  EVC MTU

   The maximum MTU of subscriber service frames can be derived from the
   physical interface MTU by default, or specified under the "evc-mtu"
   leaf if it is different than the default number.

5.1.3.1.8.7.  MAC Address Limit

   The service provider may choose to impose a per-attachment circuit
   "mac-addr-limit" in addition to the service-level MAC limit, and
   specify the behavior when the limit is exceeded accordingly.

5.1.3.1.8.8.  Availability

   EVPN supports PE geo-redundancy in the access domain.  The connection
   between a multi-homed CE to PE is identified with a uniquely assigned
   ID referred as an Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI).  Because a
   learned MAC address is propagated via BGP, it allows for multiple
   active paths in forwarding state and for load-balancing options.

   The "availability" container contains ESI and redundancy mode
   attributes for an EVPN multi-homing site.

5.1.3.1.8.9.  L2CP-Control

   To facilitate interoperability between different Multiple System
   Operators (MSOs), the MEF has provided normative guidance on Layer 2
   Control Protocol (L2CP) processing requirements for each service
   type.  Subscriber and provider should make pre- arrangement on
   whether to allow interaction between the edge device or keep each
   other's control plane separate on a per-protocol basis.

   The destination MAC addresses of these L2CP PDUs fall within two
   reserved blocks specified by the IEEE 802.1 Working Group.  Packet
   with destination MAC in these multicast ranges have special
   forwarding rules.

   o  Bridge Block of Protocols: 01-80-C2-00-00-00 through
      01-80-C2-00-00-0F

   o  MRP Block of Protocols: 01-80-C2-00-00-20 through
      01-80-C2-00-00-2F

   Layer 2 protocol tunneling allows service providers to pass
   subscriber Layer 2 control PDUs across the network without being
   interpreted and processed by intermediate network devices.  These
   L2CP PDUs are transparently encapsulated across the MPLS-enabled core
   network in Q-in-Q fashion.

   The "L2CP-control" container contains the list of commonly used L2CP
   protocols and parameters.  The service provider can specify DISCARD,
   PEER, or TUNNEL mode actions for each individual protocol.

   In addition, "provider-bridge-group" and "provider-bridge-mvrp"
   addresses are also listed in the L2CP container.

5.1.3.1.8.10.  Service

   The "service" container defines service parameters associated with
   the site.

5.1.3.1.8.10.1.  Bandwidth

   The service bandwidth refers to the bandwidth requirement between PE
   and CE.  The requested bandwidth is expressed as svc-input-bandwidth
   and svc-output-bandwidth.  Input/output direction is using customer
   site as reference: input bandwidth means download bandwidth for the
   site, and output bandwidth means upload bandwidth for the site.

   The service bandwidth is only configurable at the site-network-access
   level (i.e., for the port associated with the site).

   Using a different input and output bandwidth will allow service
   provider to know if a customer allows for asymmetric bandwidth access
   like ADSL.  It can also be used to set a rate-limit in a different
   way for upload and download on symmetric bandwidth access.

   The bandwidth container may also include a "cos-id" parameter.  If
   the "cos-id" is not present within the bandwidth container, the
   bandwidth is per evc, which provides rate enforcement for all ingress
   service frames at the interface that are associated with a particular
   EVC.

   If the "cos-id" is present, the bandwidth is per CoS, which provides
   rate enforcement for all service frames for a given class of service.
   The class of service is identified via a CoS identifier.  So this
   bandwidth profile applies to service frames over an EVC with a

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


   particular CoS value.  Multiple input/output-bandwidthper-cos-id can
   be associated with the same EVC.

5.1.3.1.8.10.2.  QoS

   The model defines QoS parameters as an abstraction:

   o  qos-classification-policy: Defines a set of ordered rules to
      classify customer traffic.

   o  qos-profile: Provides a QoS scheduling profile to be applied.

5.1.3.1.8.10.2.1.  QoS Classification

   In MEF 23.2 ([MEF-23-2]) three types of model are defined as the
   following:

   Class-of-Service Identifier based on EVC or OVC EP (End Point):  In
      this model, regardless of customer marking, all in-profile frames
      will be marked with the service level in the contractual
      agreement.  Customer CoS markings are preserved throughout the
      provider network.  The bandwidth profile consists of one set of
      CIR/CBS and EIR/EBS values.

   Class-of-Service Identifier based on Priority Code Point:  Using this
      model, multiple classes of services can be associated with a
      single customer EVC, identified by dot1p bits in the C-tag.  Each
      service level has its own individual bandwidth profile.  Out-of-
      profile packets will be discarded.  Customer CoS markings are
      preserved.

   Class-of-Service Identifier based on DSCP:  Using this model,
      multiple classes of service can be associated with a single
      customer EVC, identified by DSCP bits in the IP header.  Each
      service level has its own individual bandwidth profile.  Out-of-
      profile packets will be discarded.  Customer CoS markings are
      preserved.

   Similarly, the cos-color-id can be assigned based on EVC or OVC EP,
   dot1p value in C-tag, or DSCP in IP header.  Ingress service frames
   are metered against the bandwidth profile based on the cos-
   identifier.  A "color" will be assigned to a service frame to
   identify its bandwidth profile conformance.  A service frame is
   "green" if it is conformant with "committed" rate of the bandwidth
   profile.  A Service Frame is "yellow" if it is exceeding the
   "committed" rate but conformant with the "excess" rate of the
   bandwidth profile.  Finally, a service frame is "red" if it is

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


   conformant with neither the "committed" nor "excess" rates of the
   bandwidth profile.

   Ingress/egress-bandwidth-profile-per-evc presents the ingress/egress
   bandwidth profile per EVC, providing rate enforcement for all ingress
   service frames at the interface that are associated with a particular
   EVC.

   Alternately, ingress/egress-bandwidth-profile-per-cos-id presents the
   ingress/egress bandwidth profile per CoS, providing rate enforcement
   for all service frames for a given class of service.  The class of
   service is identified via a CoS identifier.  So this bandwidth
   profile applies to service frames over an EVC with a particular CoS
   value.  Multiple ingress/egress-bandwidth-profile-per-cos-id can be
   associated with the same EVC.

   QoS classification rules are handled by qos-classification-policy.
   The qos-classification-policy is an ordered list of rules that match
   a flow or application and set the appropriate target class of service
   (target-class-id).  The user can define the match using physical port
   reference or a more specific flow definition (based layer 2 source
   and destination MAC address, cos,dscp,cos-id, color-id etc.).  When a
   flow definition is used, the user can use a target-sites leaf- list
   to identify the destination of a flow rather than using destination
   addresses.  A rule that does not have a match statement is considered
   as a match-all rule.  A service provider may implement a default
   terminal classification rule if the customer does not provide it.  It
   will be up to the service provider to determine its default target
   class.

5.1.3.1.8.10.2.2.  QoS Profile

   User can choose between standard profile provided by the operator or
   a custom profile.  The qos-profile defines the traffic scheduling
   policy to be used by the service provider.

   A custom qos-profile is defined as a list of class of services and
   associated properties.  The properties are:

   o  byte-offset: The optional "byte-offset" indicates how many bytes
      in the service frame header are excluded from rate enforcement.

   o  rate-limit: Used to rate-limit the class of service.  The value is
      expressed as a percentage of the global service bandwidth.  When
      the qos-profile is implemented at CE side the svc-output-bandwidth
      is taken into account as reference.  When it is implemented at PE
      side, the svc-input-bandwidth is used.

   o  frame-delay: Used to define the latency constraint of the class.
      The latency constraint can be expressed as the lowest possible
      latency or a latency boundary expressed in milliseconds.  How this
      latency constraint will be fulfilled is up to the service provider
      implementation: a strict priority queueing may be used on the
      access and in the core network, and/or a low latency routing may
      be created for this traffic class.

   o  frame-jitter: Used to define the jitter constraint of the class.
      The jitter constraint can be expressed as the lowest possible
      jitter or a jitter boundary expressed in microseconds.  How this
      jitter constraint will be fulfilled is up to the service provider
      implementation: a strict priority queueing may be used on the
      access and in the core network, and/or a jitter-aware routing may
      be created for this traffic class.

5.1.3.1.8.11.  Security Filtering

5.1.3.1.8.11.1.  BUM Strom Control

   For point-to-point E-LINE services, the provider only needs to
   deliver a single copy of each service frame to the remote PE,
   regardless whether the destination MAC address of the incoming frame
   is unicast, multicast or broadcast.  Therefore, all in-profile
   service frames should be delivered unconditionally.

   B-U-M (Broadcast-UnknownUnicast-Multicast) frame forwarding in
   multipoint-to-multipoint services, on the other hand, involves both
   local flooding to other attachment circuits on the same PE and remote
   replication to all other PEs, thus consumes additional resources and
   core bandwidth.  Special B-U-M frame disposition rules can be
   implemented at external facing interfaces (UNI or E-NNI) to rate-
   limit the B-U-M frames, in term of number of packets per second or
   bits per second.

   The threshold can apply to all B-U-M traffic, or one for each
   category.

5.1.3.1.8.11.2.  MAC Loop Protection

   MAC address flapping between different physical ports typically
   indicates a bridge loop condition in the subscriber network.
   Misleading entries in the MAC cache table can cause service frames to
   circulate around the network indefinitely and saturate the links
   throughout the provider's network, affecting other services in the
   same network.  In case of EVPN, it also introduces massive BGP
   updates and control plane instability.

   The service provider may opt to implement a switching loop prevention
   mechanism at the external facing interfaces for multipoint-to-
   multipoint services by imposing a MAC address move threshold.

   The MAC move rate and prevention-type options are listed in the "mac-
   loop-prevention" container.

5.1.3.1.8.11.3.  Service Level MAC Limit

   See Section 5.1.2.10.

5.1.3.1.8.12.  Ethernet Service OAM

   The advent of Ethernet as a wide-area network technology brings
   additional requirements of end-to-end service monitoring and fault
   management in the carrier network, particularly in the area of
   service availability and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).  Ethernet
   Service OAM in the L2SM refers to the combined protocol suites of
   IEEE 802.1ag ([IEEE-802-1ag]) and ITU-T Y.1731 ([ITU-T-Y-1731]).

   Generally speaking, Ethernet Service OAM enables service providers to
   perform service continuity check, fault-isolation, and packet delay/
   jitter measurement at per customer per EVC granularity.  The
   information collected from Ethernet Service OAM data sets is
   complementary to other higher layer IP/MPLS OSS tools to ensure the
   required service level agreements (SLAs) can be meet.

   The 802.1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) functional model is
   structured with hierarchical maintenance domains (MDs), each assigned
   a unique maintenance level.  Higher level MDs can be nested over
   lower level MDs.  However, the MDs cannot intersect.  The scope of
   each MD can be solely within a subscriber's network, solely within
   the provider's network, interact between the subscriber-to-provider
   or provider-to-provider edge equipment, or tunnel over another
   provider's network.

   Depending on the use case scenario, one or more maintenance end
   points (MEPs) can be placed on the external facing interface, sending
   CFM PDUs towards the core network (UP MEP) or downstream link (DOWN
   MEP).

   The "cfm-802.1-ag" sub-container under "port" currently presents two
   types of CFM maintenance association (MA): UP MEP for UNI-N to UNI-N
   Maintenance Association (MA) and DOWN MEP for UNI-N to UNI-C MA.  For
   each MA, the user can define the maintenance domain ID (MAID), MEP
   level, MEP direction, remote MEP ID, CoS level of the CFM PDUs,
   Continuity Check Message (CCM) interval and hold time, alarm priority
   defect, CCM priority-type, etc.

   ITU-T Y.1731 Performance Monitoring (PM) provides essential network
   telemetry information that includes the measurement of Ethernet
   service frame delay, frame delay variation, frame loss, and frame
   throughput.  The delay/jitter measurement can be either one-way or
   two-way.  Typically, a Y.1731 PM probe sends a small amount of
   synthetic frames along with service frames to measure the SLA
   parameters.

   The "y-1731" sub-container under "port" contains a set of parameters
   for use to define the PM probe information, including MAID, local and
   remote MEP-ID, PM PDU type, message period and measurement interval,
   CoS level of the PM PDUs, loss measurement by synthetic or service
   frame options, one-way or two-way delay measurement, PM frame size,
   and session type.

6.  Interaction with Other YANG Modules

   As expressed in Section 4, this service module is not intended to
   configure the network element, but is instantiated in a management
   system.

   The management system might follow modular design and comprise at
   least two different components:

   a.  The component instantiating the service model (let's call it the
       service component)

   b.  The component responsible for network element configuration
       (let's call it the configuration component)

   In some cases, when a split is needed between the behavior and
   functions that a customer requests and the technology that the
   network operator has available to deliver the service
   [I-D.wu-opsawg-service-model-explained], a new component can be
   separated out of the service component (let's call it the control
   component).  This component is responsible for network-centric
   operation and is aware of many features such as topology, technology,
   and operator policy.  As an optional component, it can use the
   service model as input and is not required at all if the control
   component delegates its control operations to the configuration
   component.

   In Section 7 we provide some example of translation of service
   provisioning requests to router configuration lines as an
   illustration.  In the NETCONF/YANG ecosystem, it is expected that
   NETCONF and YANG will be used between the configuration component and
   network elements to configure the requested service on those
   elements.

   In this framework, it is expected that YANG models will be used for
   configuring service components on network elements.  There will be a
   strong relationship between the abstracted view provided by this
   service model and the detailed configuration view that will be
   provided by specific configuration models for network elements such
   as those defined in [I-D.ietf-bess-l2vpn-yang] and
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-yang].  Service components needing configuration
   on network elements in support of the service model defined in this
   document include:

   o  VRF definition including VPN policy expression.

   o  Physical interface.

   o  Ethernet layer (VLAN ID).

   o  QoS: classification, profiles, etc.

   o  Signaling Options: support of configuration of all protocols
      listed in the document, as well as vpn policies associated with
      these protocols.

   o  Ethernet Service OAM Support.

7.  Service Model Usage Example

   As explained in Section 4, this service model is intended to be
   instantiated at a management layer and is not intended to be used
   directly on network elements.  The management system serves as a
   central point of configuration of the overall service.

   This section provides an example on how a management system can use
   this model to configure an L2VPN service on network elements.

   The example is for of a VPN service for 3 sites using point-to-point
   EVC and a Hub and Spoke VPN service topology as shown in Figure 7.
   Loadbalancing is not considered in this case.

   When receiving the request for provisioning Spoke1 site, the
   management system MUST allocate network resources for this site.  It
   MUST first determine the target network elements to provision the
   access, and especially the PE router (and may be an aggregation
   switch).  As described in Section 5.1.3.1.3, the management system
   SHOULD use the location information and SHOULD use the access-
   diversity constraint to find the appropriate PE.  In this case, we
   consider Spoke1 requires PE diversity with Hub and that management
   system allocate PEs based on lowest distance.  Based on the location
   information, the management system finds the available PEs in the
   nearest area of the customer and picks one that fits the access-
   diversity constraint.

   When the PE is chosen, the management system needs to allocate
   interface resources on the node.  One interface is selected from the
   PE available pool.  The management system can start provisioning the
   PE node by using any mean (Netconf, CLI, ...).  The management system
   will check if a VRF is already present that fits the needs.  If not,
   it will provision the VRF: Route Distinguisher will come from
   internal allocation policy model, route-targets are coming from the
   vpn-policy configuration of the site (management system allocated
   some RTs for the VPN).  As the site is a Spoke site (site-role), the
   management system knows which RT must be imported and exported.  As
   the site is provider managed, some management route-targets may also

   be added (100:5000).  Standard provider VPN policies MAY also be
   added in the configuration.

   Example of generated PE configuration:


   ip vrf Customer1
     export-map STD-CUSTOMER-EXPORT      <---- Standard SP configuration
     route-distinguisher 100:3123234324
     route-target import 100:1
     route-target import 100:5000        <---- Standard SP configuration
     route-target export 100:2                 for provider managed
   !


   When the VRF has been provisioned, the management system can start
   configuring the access on the PE using the allocated interface
   information.  The VLAN tag is chosen by the management system.  One
   VLAN tag will be picked from an allocated subnet for the PE, another
   will be used for the CE configuration.  LACP protocols will also be
   configured between PE and CE and due to provider managed model, the
   choice is up to service provider.  This choice is independent of the
   LACP protocol chosen by customer.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


   As the CE router is not reachable at this stage, the management
   system can produce a complete CE configuration that can be uploaded
   to the node by manual operation before sending the CE to customer
   premise.  The CE configuration will be built as for the PE.  Based on
   the CE type (vendor/model) allocated to the customer and bearer
   information, the management system knows which interface must be
   configured on the CE.  PE-CE link configuration is expected to be
   handled automatically using the service provider OSS as both
   resources are managed internally.  CE to LAN interface parameters
   like dot1Q tag are derived from the ethernet-connection taking into
   account how management system distributes dot1Q tag between PE and CE
   within subnet.  This will allow to produce a plug'n'play
   configuration for the CE.

   Example of generated CE configuration:


                 interface GigabitEthernet0/9
                   switchport trunk allowed vlan none
                   switchport mode trunk

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document MAY be accessed via the
   RESTCONF protocol [RFC8040] or NETCONF protocol ([RFC6241]).  The
   lowest RESTCONF or NETCONF layer requires that the transport-layer
   protocol provides both data integrity and confidentiality, see
   Section 2 in [RFC8040] and [RFC6241].  The client MUST carefully
   examine the certificate presented by the server to determine if it
   meets the client's expectations, and the server MUST authenticate
   client access to any protected resource.  The client identity derived
   from the authentication mechanism used is subject to the NETCONF
   Access Control Module (NACM) ([RFC6536]).  Other protocols to access
   this YANG module are also required to support the similar mechanism.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model             February 2017


   The data nodes defined in the "ietf-l2vpn-svc" YANG module MUST be
   carefully created/read/updated/deleted.  The entries in the lists
   below include customer proprietary or confidential information,
   therefore only authorized clients MUST access the information and the
   other clients MUST NOT be able to access to the information.

   o  /l2vpn-svc/customer-info/customer-info

   o  /l2vpn-svc/vpn-services/vpn-svc

   o  /l2vpn-svc/sites/site

10.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Qin Wu and Adrian Farrel for facilitating work on the
   initial revisions of this document.

   This document has drawn on the work of the L3SM Working Group
   expressed in [I-D.ietf-l3sm-l3vpn-service-model].

11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new URI from the IETF XML registry
   ([RFC3688]).  The following URI is suggested:


       URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l2vpn-svc
       Registrant Contact: L2SM WG
       XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace


   This document also requests a new YANG module name in the YANG Module
   Names registry ([RFC6020]) with the following suggestion:


       name: ietf-l2vpn-svc
       namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l2vpn-svc
       prefix: l2vpn-svc
       reference: RFC XXXX
