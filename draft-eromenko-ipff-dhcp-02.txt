Introduction

   DHCP in IPv4 works remarkably well, and so a good idea is to keep it 
   almost unchanged in IP-FF. Instead of publishing a full RFC, I focus
   only on changes required from DHCPv4.

2. Changes from DHCPv4, as defined in RFC-2131

   FIELD       BITS       DESCRIPTION
   -----      ------      -----------

   Version       4  Versioning was added to simplify future evolution.
                      = 1

   Hops          4  Hops field shrinked from 8 bits to 4 bits.
                    (if you design a network with a  DHCP server over 15 hops
                    away from your clients, you're doing it wrong.)

   servername  128  Bytes. It was extended from 64 bytes, mainly for 
                    Unicode compatibility reasons.
                    A single Unicode character can take 2-3 bytes.

   file        255  Bytes. It was extended from 128 bytes, mainly for 
                    Unicode compatibility reasons.
                    A single Unicode character can take 2-3 bytes.

   'Seconds' and 'flags' fields were shrinked from 16-bits to 14-bits.

   All address fields were extended to 50-bits; forced change.



3. Booting IP-FF via DHCP

   In general case, booting IP-FF via DHCP is similar to IPv4.
   That is using an unspecified IP-FF address as source (0.0.0.0.0) and
   a physical MAC address (on Ethernet) or other Data-Link Layer 
   address.

   The destination multicast address for DHCP servers is   99.9.0.0.3
   The destination multicast address for DHCP clients is   99.9.0.0.4



4. Throttling / Delayed replies on High usage (recommendation)

   If a DHCP server is also the default gateway, it MAY
   artificially *delay* giving IP-FF addresses, if CPU or network
   usage is high, allowing for another DHCP server to answer DHCP,
   and allowing them becoming default gateways, providing a per-node
   load-balancing (as opposed to per-session or per-packet 
   load-balancing).

   Reasonable value is 10 ms delay per 1% CPU or (WAN/external) network
   bandwidth usage, with delays starting only after 25% usage.

   This feature MAY be implemented in quality "Enterprise-grade" DHCP 
   servers, but not required.
