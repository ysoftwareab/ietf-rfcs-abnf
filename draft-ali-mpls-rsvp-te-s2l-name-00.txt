      Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multi-Protocol Label Switching 
      (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks is the ability to

      provides a minor extension to RSVP-TE for P2MP TE LSPs [RSVP-TE-
      P2MP] to signal name for S2L sub-lsp.

   1. Introduction 

      Session name attribute of the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object [RSVP-TE] 
      is widely used by the Service Providers to identify an LSP in 
      network, usually for management operations. However, in the case 
      of P2MP LSP, a Path message can be used to signal one or more S2L 
      sub-LSPs. Session name attribute cannot be used to identify an 
      S2L by name in a network. This is a considerable limitation for 
      network management, as service providers like to use meaningful 
      names not only at the LSP level, but also at the S2L level.  

      This document addresses the above-mentioned requirement by adding 
      an optional object cal 

      led S2L_ATTRIBUTE object to the sub-LSP descriptor define in 
      [RSVP-TE-P2MP]. Specifically, it proposes to use the < 
      <S2L_SUB_LSP>, [<EXPLICIT_ROUTE>], [<S2L_ATTRIBUTE>] > tuple to 
      represents the S2L sub-LSP being signaled in the Path message.

      The document defines "S2L name" as an attribute of S2L_ATTRIBUTE 
      object. If needed, the S2L_ATTRIBUTE object can be extended to 
      include other S2L scoped attributes.  

   2. S2L Attribute Object 

      The S2L_ATTRIBUTE object can optionally appear in a Path message 
      as part of sub-LSP descriptor define in [RSVP-TE-P2MP]. 
      Specifically, [RSVP-TE-P2MP] enhances path message to signal one 
      or more S2L sub-LSPs by including the S2L sub-LSP descriptor list 
      in the Path. This document extends the definition of S2L sub-LSP 
      descriptor to optionally include S2L_ATTRIBUTE object as follows, 
      where the syntax follows the augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) 
      form. 

      <S2L sub-LSP descriptor> ::= <S2L_SUB_LSP> 

                                   [ <P2MP SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ] 

                                   [ <S2L_ATTRIBUTE> ] 

      S2L_ATTRIBUTE object has a class number TBA by IANA (of type 
      11bbbbbb), C-Type of TBD.  The format is given below.

      S2L sub-lsp Name: 

          A null padded string of characters communicating a meaningful 
      name associated with the S2L. 

      Reserved (Res) 

          This field is reserved.  It MUST be set to zero on 
      transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt. 

   2.1.  Path Message Processing 

      As specified in it [RSVP-TE-P2MP] it is possible to signal S2L 
      sub-LSPs for a   given P2MP LSP in one or more Path messages and 
      a given Path message can contain one or more S2L sub-LSPs. In 
      either case, the < [<EXPLICIT_ROUTE>] <S2L_SUB_LSP> [ 
      <S2L_ATTRIBUTE> ]> or the < [<P2MP SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE>] 
      <S2L_SUB_LSP>  [ <S2L_ATTRIBUTE> ]> tuple is used to specify an 
      S2L sub-LSP, where S2L sub-lsp name is specified in the 
      S2L_ATTRIBUTE object. The session name field of the 
      SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object can optionally be used to describe name 
      of the P2MP LSP, as described in [RSVP-TE]. Rest of the handling 
      of <S2L sub-LSP descriptor> follows the procedure specified in 
      [RSVP-TE-P2MP].  

   3. Security Considerations 

      This document does not introduce any new security issues above 
      those identified in [RSVP-TE], [RFC3473], [RFC4206] and [RSVP-TE-
      P2MP]. 

    
   4. IANA Considerations 

      New Class Number and type for S2L_ATTRIBUTE object defined in 
      this document needs to be assigned.
