Abstract 
    
   Most efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been focused on 
   environments covering Circuit oriented LSPs (Sonet/SDH, OTH, etc.) 
   and IP/MPLS Packet switched networks. However, there is minimal 
   documentation on GMPLS support of Layer-2 Label Switched Paths (L2 
   LSPs), e.g. native Ethernet LSPs, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) 
   LSPs and Frame Relay (FR) LSPs. This document provides a framework 
   for GMPLS in support of L2 LSPs in several network environments, in 
   particular, Ethernet.

3. Introduction 
    
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends 
   MPLS to support four new classes of interfaces Layer-2 Switch Capable 
   (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex (TDM) capable, Lambda Switch Capable 
   (LSC) and Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC) in addition to Packet Switch 
   Capable (PSC) already supported by MPLS. However, most of the efforts 
   have been concentrated in facilitating the realization of seamless 
   control integration of IP/MPLS networks with SONET/SDH (see [T1.105]/ 
   [G.707]), OTH (see [G.709]) transport networks or Lambda.  
    
   However, while being introduced in [RFC3945], [GMPLS-RTG] and 
   [RFC3471], the GMPLS capability to control L2SC TE links and L2 LSPs 
   has received very little attention. [RFC3471] defines the Ethernet 
   encoding types (i.e. the encoding of the LSP being requested) and 
   Layer-2 as switching capability (i.e. the type of switching to be 
   performed on a particular link). In this document, a L2LSP is defined

   as a LSP being established between intermediate L2SC interfaces. 
   These interfaces are defined in [RFC3945] as being capable of 
   recognizing frame/cell boundaries and can switch data based on the 
   content of the frame/cell header (example: interfaces on Ethernet 
   switches that switch data based on the content of the MAC header). 
    
   Note that there is a difference between GMPLS control of Ethernet 
   switches (as described in this document) and MPLS transport over 
   Ethernet links as described in [RFC3032] or MPLS transport of 
   Ethernet [RFC3916]. In [RFC3032], packets are labeled using MPLS shim 
   headers and these are encapsulated in Ethernet frames targeted at the 
   next IP/MPLS LSR along the path. At the LSRs, the Ethernet header is 
   stripped and forwarding takes place based on the encapsulated MPLS 
   label. In [RFC3916], Ethernet frames are encapsulated and transported 
   over a packet-switched (e.g. MPLS) network. For both [RFC3032] and 
   [RFC3916], forwarding is based on packet headers, whereas GMPLS 
   control of L2LSPs is based on the Layer-2 frame header. 
 
4. Objectives and Rationales 
    
   Service providers are extending the use of Ethernet beyond LAN 
   networks with the objective to provide more flexible capacity 
   management and simplified network management, as well as reduce 
   capital expenditure for network buildouts. However, Ethernet 802.1 
   bridges have limited scalability and network security support, and do 
   not provide the traffic engineering (TE) capabilities of (G)MPLS such 
   as DiffServ-TE (DS-TE). It also lacks scalable recovery mechanisms 
   for meshed networks e.g. re-routing.    
        
   This framework focuses on GMPLS usage with IEEE 802.3 Ethernet 
   networks. The scope of this document not only covers metro-core 
   network but also metro-access and aggregation networks.    
    
   Motivations for considering GMPLS control of L2 LSPs: 
   - automates the provisioning of Ethernet services such as  
     (virtual) private line and LAN services over GMPLS-capable networks 
   - facilitates the transport of client Ethernet flows without  
     requiring introducing additional intermediate packet layer LSPs,  
     that require themselves pre-provisioning actions as network trunks 
   - delivers a range of control plane driven recovery capabilities.  
     For instance, Ethernet Spanning Tree Protocol is less suitable in  
     meshed environments, whereas GMPLS control plane driven recovery  
     mechanisms are applicable   
   - simplifies the carrier network operations by avoiding dedicated   
     control protocols for managing Ethernet environments that are not   
     adapted for large scale environments and for which an IP-based   
     protocol counter-part exists (e.g. OSPF).  
   - uses IP based addressing that removes the scaling issues   
     generated by the non-hierarchical MAC addressing scheme. This GMPLS  
     capability allows constructing large scale, secure networks taking  
     advantage of IP addressing properties (at the control plane level).  
   - delivers a homogeneous set of signaling and TE mechanisms for   
     controlling L2 technologies to ease integration towards a common

     L1/L2/L3 control infrastructure capable of supporting various trust  
     models (e.g. overlay, unified)   
 
5. Deployment Scenarios 
    
5.1 Scenario 1: Access/Aggregation Networks 
    
   ISPs who deployed ATM based ADSL equipment are gradually replacing 
   them for reasons of capacity upgrade and CAPEX/OPEX reduction. While  
   Ethernet access technology facilitates simple installation as well as 
   easy configuration of Internet access with flexible usage demands, 
   some tradeoffs are the difficulties in providing QoS, user 
   authentication, and management.

       Figure 1. GMPLS enabled L2SC switches in Aggregation Networks 
    
   For this scenario, an access aggregation network is a collection of 
   ISP devices that provides connectivity between a user terminal and 
   core network. Fig. 1 shows such a network where the access switch 
   (e.g. DSLAM) and edge router implement GMPLS L2SC capability. The 
   Aggregation switches may be Ethernet 802.1 or GMPLS L2SC capable 
   switches. Note, there can be a number of Ethernet 802.1 switches 
   between the end-hosts (H1 ~ H4) and the Access (e.g. DSLAM) switch, 
   between the access and the aggregation switch, and between the 
   aggregation switch and the edge router. The devices and aggregation 
   network elements may/may not be physically co-located, and different 
   ownership models may be applicable e.g. the access switch and edge 
   router may be owned by the service provider, whereas the aggregation 
   switch is owned by an independent access provider.  
        
   In Fig 1., a possible signaling scenario would entail an RSVP Path 
   message (RFC2205) initiated from customer premise via an access line 
   to the access switch. Policy can be imposed at the access switch to 
   examine the user's request. This triggers GMPLS RSVP-TE (RFC3473) for 
   L2LSP setup from the access switch towards the edge router. The GMPLS 
   RSVP-TE Path message is processed and forwarded until reaching the 
   edge router that is GMPLS L2SC capable. The GMPLS RSVP-TE message may 
   be forwarded without the aid of link-state routing protocols in the 
   access network (e.g. proxy). The edge router replies with a GMPLS

   RSVP-TE Resv message back to the access switch to complete 
   establishment of the L2LSP. As a result, an L2 LSP is established 
   between the access switch and the edge router. The initial RSVP Path 
   message may be tunneled and further processed beyond the edge router.  
   Otherwise, upon L2LSP completion, the access switch replies with a 
   RSVP Resv message to the initial RSVP request.   
        
   When the customer initiates data transmission, the access switch maps 
   the user flow into the L2 LSP. Mapping procedure is subject to 
   implementation choices, and is out of the scope of this document. 
    
5.2 Scenario 2: Metro/Metro-core Networks 
    
   A metro-core network is a backbone that provides for Layer 2 and/or 
   Layer 3 connectivity across access and core networks. Currently, in 
   such environments, when an end-to-end "Ethernet connection" is 
   created based on a VLAN tag, their setting on each user port as well 
   as trunk port must be manually configured on each switch as shown in 
   Fig. 2.

          |      +---(VLAN1,2)---+      +---(VLAN1)---+      | 
   VLAN 2-+  #1  |               |  #2  |             |  #3  |

              |                      |                    | 
              |                   (VLAN2)                 | 
              |                      |                    | 
          +---+--+               +---+--+             +---+--+ 
          | L2SW |               | L2SW |             | L2SW +---VLAN2 
          |      +---------------+      +---(VLAN2)---+      | 
          |  #4  |               |  #5  |             |  #6  | 
          +------+               +------+             +------+ 
    
      Fig. 2: End-to-end connection based on VLAN in Ethernet network 
 
   In addition, the path may be manually selected and may be neither 
   shortest, nor optimal. To solve these issues, GMPLS label control 
   would be used for assigning VLAN tags to Ethernet ports and trunks, 
   so that the "connection" can be established as a VLAN-based label 
   switched path (LSP). The latter may be mapped on a lower layer LSP. 
        
   GMPLS RSVP-TE is used to support the Ethernet "connection" i.e. L2LSP 
   setup. OSPF-TE/IS-IS TE is used to disseminate TE routing information 
   about ports. Bandwidth of each VLAN "connection" or the bandwidth of 
   each port can be treated as a constraint of CSPF for path 
   computation. GMPLS traffic engineering can be applied, and multiple 
   ownership/trust models (e.g. overlay, peer) may be applied. 
    
5.3 Scenario 3: Unified Network 
 
   This scenario depicts the integration of packet, Ethernet and circuit 
   switching under a unified GMPLS control plane. In Fig 3, a "PSC LSR"

   is a packet based MPLS LSR, "L2SC LSR Ethernet" a GMPLS controlled 
   Ethernet switch, "LSC LSR Lambda" a GMPLS controlled optical switch. 
   In Fig 3, L2/L1 LSP refer to a Layer 2 LSP (L2LSP) over L1 LSP.

   In this multi-region scheme, aggregation of traffic onto the same LSP 
   is possible. In analogy with having packet coming in to an LER 
   (ingress LSR) with the same Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) mapped 
   on to the same MPLS LSP, it possible to select one or several of 
   these LSPs onto the same L2LSP if the are to be forwarded to the same 
   egress point in the Ethernet network. 
    
   In a further step, nesting of LSP e.g. Packet LSPs into an Ethernet 
   L2LSP can be considered. Ethernet L2LSPs can also be nested into 
   lambda LSPs. In Figure 5 a through j are different types of LSPs. a, 
   b and c are packet switched LSPs entering the packet switch capable

   The routing protocol envisaged for this type of network is OSPF-TE, 
   some extension to OSPF-TE MAY be required (the same applies when 
   considering ISIS-TE). The signaling protocol is RSVP-TE that needs to 
   be extended by a definition of an Ethernet label space (see Section 
   6.2). 
    
5.4 Scenario 4: Transport Networks 
    
   In this scenario, the network is constituted by a core network 
   including core-nodes (CN) surrounded by edge nodes (EN) that form the 
   overlay (control plane) networks. This scenario supports various 
   trust models and signaling models. An overlay trusted model may be 
   supported, allowing the core to hide its topology from the edge-nodes 
   and permitting the core restrictive actions towards the edge nodes 
   (e.g. filtering out specific RSVP objects). In addition, this 
   scenario supports networks where the core uses a non-GMPLS based 
   control plane (or no control plane e.g. management plane). 
    
   EN-CN (and CN-EN) TE links are of type [X,L2SC], ([L2SC,X] resp.), 
   where X is any ISC whose switched payload can be carried over L2SC TE 
   links. Within the network, TE links interconnecting CNs can be either 
   [L2SC,L2SC] or any other technology that can carry Layer-2 payload.

          Figure 6: GMPLS Ethernet in Overlay Transport Networks 
    
   The core networks 1 and 2 are interconnected by two CNs (CN1 and 
   CN2), that define an external network-network interface (E-NNI). 
   Within core network 1, [A,B] and [A,E] are [L2SC,Y] TE links. Within 
   core network 2, [G,H] and [I,H] are [Y,L2SC] TE links. 
   - When [C,CN1] and [D,CN1] are [Y,L2SC] TE Links, [CN2,F] and  
     [CN2,J] are [L2SC,Y] TE Links, and [CN1,CN2] is a [L2SC,L2SC] TE  
     link, the L2 LSP that can be setup between node EN1 (ingress) and  
     node EN2 (egress) is constituted by two LSP segments of type Y.  
     The first LSP segment between A and CN1 and the second between CN2  
     and H. These segments are inter-connected by the [L2SC,L2SC] TE  
     link defined at the E-NNI. The intermediate GMPLS L2SC hops for  
     this L2 LSP are thus A, CN1, CN2 and H. 
   - When these conditions are not met, in particular, when the  
     [CN1,CN2] link is of type e.g. [Y,Y], the L2 LSP that can be setup  
     between node EN1 (ingress) and node EN2 (egress) is constituted by  
     one LSP segment of type Y defined between A and H. The  
     intermediate GMPLS L2SC hops for this L2 LSP are thus A and H. 
    
6. Requirements   
    
6.1 Control plane scope   
    
   Nodes playing an active role in signaling and routing MUST support 
   the GMPLS capabilities required by the present section. Their 
   implementation SHOULD minimize overhead and manual configuration. 
    
   The IP control channel between GMPLS L2SC nodes can be out-of-band 
   or in-band. Signaling and routing information exchange between 
   adjacent GMPLS nodes and processing MUST be strictly independent of 
   the control channel implementation. 
    
6.2 Labeling and Label scope requirements  
    
   A GMPLS labeled frame is an Ethernet frame whose header encodes the 
   label value. GMPLS Ethernet switches SHOULD be able to correctly 
   handle all types of Ethernet MAC frames, including the GMPLS labeled 
   frames, to ensure inter-working with 802.1 bridges.  
    
   The label's interpretation depends on the type of the link over which 
   the label is used. Labels are locally assigned, interpreted and have 
   local significance. This does not preclude that the same label value 
   can be assigned by consecutive hops (e.g. as it is the case in 
   Scenario 2).

draft-papadimitriou-ccamp-gmpls-ethernet-framework-00.txt    June 2005 
 
 
   Label value space is assumed to be independent of the implementation 
   of the Ethernet frame forwarding/switching. 
    
6.4 Link Discovery 
    
   Nodes are inter-connected by point-to-point L2SC links. GMPLS L2SC 
   nodes MUST support discovery of per TE link capabilities.  
    
   In addition, GMPLS link discovery SHOULD provide  
   - data link property correlation to support aggregating multiple data  
     links into a single TE Link and to synchronize their properties    
   - data link verification to verify the data links physical  
     connectivity and verify the mapping of the Interface ID to Link ID  
     and their local-remote associations     
        
   Optionally, fault management MAY be provided to suppress alarms and 
   localize failures.  
    
   Extensions to LMP MAY be required to deliver this functionality. 
    
6.5 Routing Advertisement and Traffic Engineering 
    
   To facilitate IGP operations such as forming neighbor adjacencies, 
   flooding link state database packets, and representing topology, 
   routing SHOULD treat the broadcast point-to-point control channel 
   between adjacent LSRs as a point-to-point circuit [IGP-LAN]. 
    
   The solution MUST support the exchange of TE (intra-domain) and 
   reachability (intra and inter-domain) information across the GMPLS 
   Ethernet network(s).  
    
   Scenario 3 that relies on a unified TE control plane SHALL be able to 
   take TE decisions such as congestion avoidance and recovery actions 
   at the optimal layer. 
    
6.6 Implication(s) on Signaling 
    
   Signaling mechanisms MUST apply to bi-directional L2LSP setup and 
   where appropriate unidirectional L2LSP setup. Interface 
   identification MUST follow the rules defined in [RFC3473], Section 
   8.1 and [RFC3477]. 
     
6.6.1 RSVP Signaling   
    
   GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling for setup/teardown of L2LSP (across GMPLS 
   Ethernet switches) MUST keep RSVP sessions end-to-end significant. 
 
   L2LSP notification and graceful deletion procedures [RFC3473] SHOULD 
   be supported. Graceful Restart upon control channel and node failure 
   SHOULD also be supported.

draft-papadimitriou-ccamp-gmpls-ethernet-framework-00.txt    June 2005 
 
 
   Scenarios providing aggregation capability SHOULD support nesting of 
   L2LSPs or PSC LSPs into a FA (L2) LSP when the head/tail end-nodes 
   provide de/multiplexing capabilities.  
    
   L2LSP splicing (see [RFC3471]) and L2LSP stitching [RSVP-ID] MUST be 
   envisioned in the context of multi-domain L2LSP environments. The 
   solution MUST support both overlay [GMPLS-UNI] and inter-domain 
   [framework] signaling models. 
    
6.6.2 L2 Label Request 
    
   The Generalized Label Request is defined in [RFC3471], Section 3.1. 
   The LSP Encoding Type and Switching Type to be used for requesting 
   L2 LSP label are Ethernet and L2SC respectively. Generalized PID (G-
   PID) that identifies the payload carried by Ethernet L2LSPs MUST use 
   standard Ethertype values.  
 
6.6.3 L2 Traffic Parameters 
    
   Per [RFC3471], GMPLS allows the inclusion of technology specific 
   parameters in signaling. These parameters MUST include the L2 link 
   type that comprises the requested LSP e.g. Ethernet Port and the MTU 
   value. They MUST also be capable to describe traffic parameters for 
   this L2LSP such as the Peak Rate (PIR and PBS), the Committed Rate 
   (CIR and CBS), and the Excess Rate (EIR and EBS). 
    
6.6.4 L2 Label  
    
   L2 Label follows the rules defined in [RFC3471]. The interpretation 
   of the received label depends on the type of the link over which the 
   label is used. The received label MUST be interpreted according the 
   requestor traffic parameters i.e. a label by itself does not allow 
   knowing the detailed properties of the L2 LSP being requested (i.e. 
   L2 labels are context sensitive). 
 
   Bi-directional L2 LSPs are indicated by the presence of an upstream 
   label in the Path message.  
 
6.6.5 Explicit Routing support   
    
   Explicit and Record routing MUST be supported for scenarios making 
   use of source routing such as to provide constraint based routing 
   (for resource and/or data traffic oriented TE) and loop avoidance. 
    
   Explicit routing, when used, MUST follow the procedures defined in 
   [RFC3209], [RFC3473], and [RFC3477].  
    
   Record routing, when used, MUST follow the procedures defined in 
   [RFC3209], [RFC3473], and [RFC3477].  
     
   Explicit label control SHOULD be supported (see [RFC4003]) at least 
   in scenario 2 and 4.

7. Reference other SDOs  
      
7.1 IEEE 802.1   
    
   The IEEE specifies elements of switching in Ethernet networks. They 
   should be consulted on the scenarios and framework proposed in this 
   document and any solutions developed in the IETF context should be 
   reviewed by the appropriate IEEE working groups to ensure the 
   solution is not harmful to 802.1 networks.  
        
   There have been several approaches specified by IEEE to overcome the  
   Scaling limitations and to extend service of Ethernet LAN across MAN 
   and WAN, such as IEEE Provider Bridge [802.1ad] and Provider Backbone 
   Bridge [802.1ah]. 
 
7.2 ITU-T SG15   
    
   SG15 is currently defining Ethernet Transport Network architecture 
   and services e.g. EPL, EVPL, EPLan and EVPLan. Specific work items 
   are also dedicated to the definition of Ethernet OAM, traffic 
   management and performance as well as the definition of Ethernet UNI 
   and NNI.  
    
   During revision of the Recommendation G.8010 on defining Ethernet 
   transport network, the IETF ASON/GMPLS control plane definition 
   (including Point-to-point and multi-point ETH VC set up, 
   modification, teardown, etc.) should be positioned as another 
   operation mode analogous to IEEE 802.1 PB and PBB. 
     
8. Security considerations 
    
   The introduction of L2 LSP, particularly in Ethernet networks, 
   raises similar security issues such as with L1 LSPs and additional 
   L2-specific security issues that need to be solved. The solution 
   MUST protect against the following security threats: 
   - Possibility for the network to control the traffic injected by the  
     client in the data plane (BPDU, Multicast, Broadcasts, etc.) or in 
     the control plane (RSVP-TE signaling messages)      
   - All usual threats brought by IP functionalities (control and data  
     plane) 
   - Entry points induced by the possible coexistence of the two  
     technologies (L2LSPs and usual Broadcast Ethernet mode) 
    
   Current RSVP security mechanisms [RFC2207], [RFC3097] should also be 
   analyzed/evaluated in the context of L2 LSPs. 
    
8.1 Attacks on the Data Plane 
    
   This category encompasses attacks on the data plane. Attacks on the 
   data plane can be of the following form:  
        - modification of data traffic 
        - insertion of non-authentic data traffic 
        - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

draft-papadimitriou-ccamp-gmpls-ethernet-framework-00.txt    June 2005 
 
 
        - traffic snooping 
    
   Introduction of L2 LSP signaling MUST prevent these attacks by 
   offering adequate filters (like ACLs or some new means). 
    
   L2 LSP SHOULD reduce data plane threats, as the number of network 
   entry points to control is reduced. A L2 LSP is by nature a hermetic 
   tunnel, with a single entry point (head-end LSR). Policing and 
   filtering is required only on the head-end LSR. 
    
   Moreover, some mechanisms MUST be provided at the network edges (on 
   the head-end LSRs) to rate limit the amount of traffic that can 
   transit into a given L2 LSP.  
    
8.2 Attacks on the Control Plane 
    
   There are two threats concerning the control plane. The first one 
   corresponds to the support of signaling by the client side. As LSP 
   tunnels MAY be signaled from the client site using RSVP-TE, control 
   of such activity MUST be provided so that it cannot be used to fail 
   the entire network. Different trust models MUST be supported.  
        
   There MUST be a way to limit, by configuration, the number of L2LSPs 
   that can be signaled by a particular client, also there must be a 
   way to rate limit RSVP-TE client control plane traffic (mainly 
   refresh interval). Also the operator MUST be able to rate limit, by 
   configuration, the total amount of memory and/or CPU allocated to 
   the RSVP engine, and react appropriately when such bound is reached.  
        
   Another threat comes from the introduction of IP control functions 
   in L2 equipments (such as the handling of multicast). GMPLS Ethernet 
   networks will inherit the security issues of IP networks similar to 
   other GMPLS client networks, and the appropriate trust models MUST 
   be supported. 
    
8.3 Security problems induced by the migration 
    
   If both L2 LSPs and classical Ethernet are used on the same network, 
   then different ranges of VLANs must be considered so that the 
   different traffics, with different VLAN semantics, do not get mixed 
   for example.
