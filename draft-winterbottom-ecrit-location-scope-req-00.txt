Abstract

   Special kinds of services require user location information to be
   authenticated and validated within a specific operating domain.  An
   example of such a service is the emergency services network, where
   the location of a caller is known with in the domain of the telephone
   network, while the name or true identity of the caller is not
   intrinsically known.  This paper describes the entities and key

   requirements necessary to provide such a service in an internet

1.  Introduction

   Some network elements and services have special requirements on
   information concerning a user's location that must be satisfied
   before the service is provided to the user.  The primary group of
   services that fall into this category are the emergency services that
   make use of a user's location to route calls to their destination and
   subsequently dispatch service crews to that destination.  Since the
   cost of providing these services is high, and the risk to service
   crews in many cases is life threatening, simply trusting that a user
   has provided an accurate and valid location is not enough.  The
   service provider requires additional information tying the user to
   his/her location and some audit trail to the access network servicing
   the user in the event of a mishap.  In the interests of continuous
   improvement, it is desirable that incidences of erroneous location
   information being provided can be traced back to an answerable access
   provider and corrected.  This paper describes a base set of
   requirements that need to be met to satisfy emergency service
   provider's and then goes on to place scope around these requirements
   based on possible access types and situations.

2.  Terminology

   The key conventions and terminology used in this paper are defined as
   follows:

   End-User: The user or user device entity needing sending his/her
   location to another entity in the network.

   Domain: An area or group of services falling with in a specific
   category or jurisdictional boundary.

   Domain Authentication and Validation Entity: A node that has
   authority within a given domain to authenticate and validate user
   location information.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Key Requirements

3.1  Requirement 1

   The emergency network in most cases today is accessed via the PSTN
   using either a wireline or a cellular device.  In both cases location
   information is provided by the Carrier and is used directly to route
   the call.  Since the Carrier must route the call to the emergency
   network, the emergency network holds the carrier responsible for the
   correct location determination and routing, and this forms the basis
   of requirement 1.  A certain level of authentication and validation
   around the source of the location is required for the domain in which
   the information is to be used.

3.2  Requirement 2

   The location information MUST be attributed to a specific point in
   time.  That is, the location used for routing and which is reported
   to the emergency services operator, must be the actual location of
   the caller at the time of making the call.  This provides operator's
   with confidence that the End-User is at the location.  This is
   accomplished today with existing telephony networks either through
   the use of a calling-number to address "wire-map" database, or for
   cellular with more complex triangulation and GPS based techniques
   where the location is determined by the network and delivered at the
   time of the call.

3.3  Requirement 3

   The location information MUST be attributed to a specific End-User.
   That is, for each call initiated, the emergency network requires that
   the location was determined for that specific caller and is not
   reused from a location determination applicable to a different
   End-User.  This information defines when the location was attributed
   to the End-User, thereby tying a valid location to a user at a
   specific point in time.

3.4  Requirement 4

   Requirement 1 states that a level of authentication and validation
   for the source of the location is required.  This implies the need to
   for the End-User to determine the authenticating and validating
   entity for the emergency services domain in which they reside.  That
   is, it must be possible for an End-User to discover and utilize an
   answerable source of location in the access network they are using.

3.5  Requirement 5

   The End-User must be able to establish a session with the access
   domain authenticating and validating entity to obtain a certified
   location.  The authentication of the location is granted with an
   expiry time, after which the location within the domain is deemed
   invalid.

3.6  Requirement 6

   The session between the End-User and the domain authenticating and
   validating entity SHALL NOT require the true identity of the
   End-User.  That is, the true identity of the user need never be
   revealed to the domain authenticating and validating entity, a random
   unique pseudonym generated within the authenticated domain is
   sufficient.

3.7  Requirement 7

   The domain authenticating and validation entity MUST be able to
   accept a location provided by an End-User.  On receipt of the
   End-User's location the domain authenticating and validation entity
   SHOULD validate the location as being applicable to that domain that
   is, it falls within reasonable geographic boundaries for that domain
   - before returning the certified location to the End-User.

3.8  Requirement 8

   The End-User may have no means of determining or providing a
   location, in which case the domain authentication and validation
   entity MAY provide an estimate of location.

3.9  Requirement 9

   Where the End-User does not desire the transmission of their location
   in-band with their call setup, they shall have the option of
   requesting a unique query key such that only authorized end points
   may query the location directly from the domain.

4.  Security Considerations

   The requirements put forth in this draft suggest signaling interfaces
   which have a variety of potential threats.  Each of the specific
   protocols defined in support of these requirements must adequately
   address those threats.
