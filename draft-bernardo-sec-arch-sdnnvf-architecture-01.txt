Software-Defined Networking and Network Functions Virtualization Security Architecture 
                draft-bernardo-sec-arch-sdnnvf-architecture-01.txt

Abstract

SDN and NFV have been creating paradigm shifts across major service providers, governments, 
and industries. In most recent months, these two novel frameworks created jitters and 
excitements across major academic institutions and communities of practice. While these are 
considered disruptive to major network infrastructures operating on status quo, SDN and NFV 
nonetheless bring network resiliency, scalability, manageability, and, most importantly, 
lower long-term operational expenditures. 

They create opportunities for  innovation that engage key players from networks, security, 
and software to develop new software controllers, APIs, networks, and technologies. 

This document aims to propose a formal security architecture that overarches important aspects 
of SDN and NFV 's frameworks. 

The architecture can be elaborated and modified as these two frameworks mature over time.

 1.	Introduction
 
1.1 Even though its concept had been around for decades, SDN did not really gain momentum 
    until it was implemented within an academic environment in 2011. This has gained 
    prominence since then. 

    In 2012, it was widely speculated that Google implemented SDN and OpenFlow into their 
    networks, and created their own OpenFlow-enabled switches due to the limited vendors 
    supporting this protocol. 

    This speculation has since gained significant interests across many industries. 

    To understand SDN is to look at the OSI layer,where one will find similar concepts  
    of abstraction and separation, and tiering and layering. 

    In SDN, control and data planes are separated, centralizing the control and programmability 
    of the network. APIs are Application Program Interfaces, created to connect applications 
    on the plane.  

The Northbound APIs achieve abstractions to the top of the framework while the Southbound APIs do 
the same at the bottom of the framework. East and westbound APIs, which are formally introduced in 
this draft, can be used for horizontal communications across  devices, systems , or software 
on a given plane.To put it simply, the northbound and southbound APIs are used for vertical 
connections, while the east and westbound APIs are for horizontal connections. 

The application tier hosts business applications and application-based security systems. 
The control plane composes controllers, where routing and security policies are implemented. 
The data plane is basically the infrastructures composing network devices, routers, switches, 
and security devices. 

Each plane can be virtualized as and when needed. Initially, it targeted campus, data centre 
and cloud, but eventually adapted by service and network providers.

Internet-Draft 		  SDN/NFV Security  Architectures   			   September 2014

  1.2 What is NFV

On the other hand, NFV , which was formalized in 2012, relocates network functions from dedicated 
hardwareappliances to generic servers. It was initially intended for routers, firewalls, and gateways, 
but can be expanded to include load balancers and other intermediary devices. 

Unlike SDN, NFV does not have a specific protocol. Both SDN and NFV create open innovation by 
third parties, reducing capital and operational expenditures.   

2. Security Risks

The creation of SDN/NFS is undoubtedly based on the existing traditional networks. The defined 
goals are focused on either the enhancement of existing network designs or innovation, building 
new infrastructures from scratch as part of the green field strategy or moving traditional 
infrastructures to SDN (i.e., Brownfield) with a mixture of frameworks (hybrid).

This novel creation brings new perspectives on how to effectively manage infrastructures that are
beneficial to the businesses' bottom lines, while supporting a significant increase of traffic 
engineering requirements.

Subsequently, since the design is based on the traditional networks in terms of design, the risks 
associated with the traditional networks are inherited by the new frameworks. It is therefore 
important to evaluate risks according to best practices, whenever available. However, SDN/NFV
best practices are limited to date, due to the lack of extensive industry-based use cases 
surrounding security and risks.

SDN and NFS, like any new frameworks, have new security risks that need to be addressed. For example, 
the issues surrounding the absence of standards in the development of northbound APIs, including limited 
information about the east and westbound APIs, raise potential risks - especially when they are open 
to third-party development, where almost everyone can participate in an open-source software development 
for SDN controllers, orchestrators, and applications, and can design the systems whenever he/she likes 
without functional and security considerations put in place.

Certainly, the need to identify the risks when implementing SDN is equally paramount to achieving 
resilient and secure infrastructures.

   o The following are the risks identified on SDN/NFV based on the    
     traditional network designs.

	a. Adversarial traffic flows - traffic passing through network devices, 
   	   interfaces, and hosts.
	b. Attacks on vulnerabilities in network devices - not updated patch and 
	   version 
	c. Attacks on vulnerabilities in orchestrators and administrative 
	   servers - unsecure servers, lacks security on admin profile
	d. Attacks on control plane communications- single point of failures, 
   	   unreliable controllers and unsecure connections   

   o New risks associated with SDN/NFV implementations are identified, and   
     are as follows:

	e. Attacks on SDN controllers - unreliable software APP/SDN controller
   	f. Attacks on Southbound interfaces - exposed interfaces
   	g. Unsecure openflow traffic - unencrypted /unsecure traffic
   	h. Unreliable North/East-West APIs - unreliable software installed 
      	   across the same broadcast domain
	i. Vulnerable Programming models - inadequate security involvement in 
      	   the Software Development  Lifecycle

These new frameworks will continue to evolve and eventually used across the industries, 
so as the increments of the security risks. 

Therefore appropriate security mitigations must be considered.

3. Security Mitigations

A few have been identified that must be considered when implementing SDN/NFV.

       j. Hypervisors must be secure  
       k. Controllers must be secure
       l. Hardening OS security
       m. Extensive API validations 
       n. Extensive APPs penetration tests
       o. Monitor traffic
       p. Protocol must be secure
       q. Session establishment protocol for communication and traffic flow  
          must be secure
       r. Multiple authentication
       s. Limited time options for messaging 
       t. Network devices must be secure
       u. Separation/segmentation of networks and subnets
