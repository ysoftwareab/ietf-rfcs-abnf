Abstract

   This draft describes an extension to vCard to support Instant
   Messaging (IM) and Presence Protocol (PP) applications. It allows a
   URL that is associated with IM or PP to be specified inside of a
   vCard.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

   Editor Note: This is an very early draft to facilitate discussion.

Internet-Draft                 vCard-IMPP                  February 2003


1. Overview

   As more and more people use various IM and presence applications, it
   becomes important for them to be able to share this contact address
   information along with the rest of their contact information. RFC
   2425 [1] and RFC 2426 [2] define a standard format for this
   exchanging contact information referred to as vCard. This document
   defines a new type for vCard for representing IMPP URLs. It is very
   similar to existing types for representing email address and
   telephone contact information.

   The type entry to hold this new contact information is an IMPP type.
   The IMPP entry has a single URI that indicates the address of a
   service that provides IM, PP, or both. There are also some parameters
   defined that give hints as to when certain URLs would be appropriate.
   A given vCard can have multiple IMPP entries but each entry can
   contain only one URL. Each IMPP entry can contain multiple
   parameters. Any combination of parameters is valid though the same
   parameter should occur at most once in a given IMPP entry.

   The normative definition of this new vCard type is given in Section 2
   and an informational ABNF is provided in Section 3.

2. IMPP Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type IMPP

   Type name: IMPP

   Type purpose: To specify the instant messaging and presence protocol
   communication with the object the vCard represents.

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type value: A single URL.

   Type special notes: The type can include the type parameter "TYPE" to
   specify intended use for the URL. The TYPE parameter values can
   include:

   An indication of the type of communications this URI is appropriate
   for. This can be a value of PERSONAL or BUSINESS.

   An indication of the location of a device associated with this
   communications. Values can be HOME, WORK, or MOBILE.

Internet-Draft                 vCard-IMPP                  February 2003


   An indication of some of the core capabilities of this instant
   messaging system. Values can be PRES, VIDEO, VOICE, TEXT, SMS,
   NUMERIC, and BEEP. PRES indicates the system supports some presence
   protocol. VIDEO, VOICE, and TEXT indicate the system supports voice,
   video, and text messaging respectively. SMS indicates short text
   messages. Short is not defined here but something like 160 octets may
   be a reasonable assumption. NUMERIC indicates that only numeric text
   messages are allowed, while BEEP indicates that indicates that the
   information the system can deliver is that a message was sent to the
   target user.

   The value STORE indicates that the system can store messages for
   future delivery to intended user.

   The value PREF indicates this is a preferred address and has the same
   semantics as the PREF value in a TEL type.

3. Formal Grammar

   The following ABNF grammar[4] extends the grammar found in RFC 2425
   and RFC 2426.


   ;For name="IMPP"
    param      = impp-param ; Only impp parameters are allowed

    value      = uri

    impp-param = "TYPE" "=" impp-type *("," impp-type)

    impp-type  = "PERSONAL" / "BUSINESS" / ; purpose of communications
                 "HOME" / "WORK" / "MOBILE" / ; useful?
                 "VIDEO" / "VOICE" / "TEXT" /  ; core capabilities
                 "SMS" / "NUMERIC"  /  "BEEP"  / "PRES" ;  needed???
                 "STORE" / ;  like MSG
                 "PREF" /
                 iana-token / x-name;
                 ; Values are case insensitive


4. Example


   BEGIN:vCard
   VERSION:3.0
   FN:John Doe
   IMPP;TYPE=personal,text,store,pref:im:john@example.com
   END:vCard

5. Open Issues

   Is this needed at all? Other options include just putting URL for
   IMPP systems in the TEL type. Using the TEL type is undesirable
   because the semantics for what you can do with it are confusing in
   the IMPP case and the parameters are not an excellent fit to IMPP.

   Are PERSONAL and BUSINESS a conflict in meaning with HOME and WORK?
   In the TEL type HOME and WORK indicated a location but have slowly
   come to mean an indicator that personal or business communication is
   requested. Would a person that had a personal mobile phone and a work
   mobile phone have HOME,MOBILE and WORK,MOBILE?

   Is there any need for SMS, NUMERIC, BEEP? This is not a system for
   negating capabilities and these seem like too fine grain of detail.
   On the other hand the existing vCard supports pagers and such and
   these definitions would help users avoid sending large messages to
   GSM cell phones.

   Is STORE needed? It mirrors the functionality of MSG in the TEL type
   and a feature supported by many IM systems.

   Should PP and IM be treated the same way? Would it be better to have
   an IM type and a PP type instead of the IMPP type?

   Is there really an IANA registry for this? RFC 2425 and RFC 2426
   would imply these types are IANA registered. Help!

   Convergence issues: Is email just TYPE=text,store with an email URL?
   Is the TEL type just TYPE=voice with a tel URL?

6. IANA Considerations

   Still to do. Section 2 forms the IANA registration.

7. Security Considerations

   Still to do. Does not introduce additional security issues beyond
   current vCard specification. Note people may consider their presence
   information more sensitive than some other address information.
