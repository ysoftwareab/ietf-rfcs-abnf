	2.  Abstract
	
	This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
	(MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
	based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
	managing Frame Relay Switched Virtual Circuit's and Data 
	Compression over a Frame Relay virtual circuit.
	This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
	community.
	

	
	3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
	
	The major components of the SNMPv2 Network Management
	framework are described in the documents listed below.
	
	o    RFC 1902 [1] defines the Structure of Management
	     Information (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and
	     naming objects for the purpose of management.
	
	o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of
	     managed objects (MO) for the Internet suite of protocols.
	
	o    RFC 1905 [3] defines the protocol used for network access
	     to managed objects.
	
	o    RFC 1315 [4] defines the protocol used for managing
	     Frame Relay DTE's.

	The framework is adaptable/extensible by defining new MIBs to
	suit  the requirements of specific
	applications/protocols/situations.
	
	Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
	the  MIB.  Objects  in  the  MIB  are  defined  using the
	subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
	SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT
	IDENTIFIER, which is an administratively assigned name. The
	object  type  together  with  an  object  instance  serves  to
	uniquely  identify  a  specific  instantiation  of the object.
	For human convenience, often a textual string, termed the
	descriptor, is  used  to refer to the object type.

	4.  Overview
	
	4.1.  Frame Relay Extensions for SVC's and Data Compression

	This MIB addresses the instances needed to be able to manage both the
	Frame Relay Forum's Implementation agreements for SVC's (FRF.4)
	and Data Compression (FRF.9).
