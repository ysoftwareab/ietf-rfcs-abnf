Abstract

   This document extends [RFC6830] to allow Map Servers to send SMR
   messages.

   This extension is intended to be used in some SDN deployments that
   use LISP as a southbound protocol with (P)ITRs that are compliant
   with [RFC6830].  In this use-case mapping updates do not come from
   ETRs, but rather from a centralized controller that pushes the
   updates directly to the Mapping System.  In such deployments, Map
   Servers will benefit from having a mechanism to inform directly
   (P)ITRs about updates in the mappings they are serving.

1.  Introduction

   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) [RFC6830] splits current IP
   addresses in two different namespaces, Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs)
   and Routing Locators (RLOCs).  LISP uses a map-and-encap approach
   that relies in two entities, the Mapping System and the Tunnel
   Routers.  The Tunnel Routers are deployed at LISP sites edge points
   and perform encapsulation and decapsulation of LISP data packets.
   The Mapping System is a distributed database that stores and
   disseminates EID-RLOC bindings across different Map-Servers.  LISP
   Tunnel Routers keep a cache of EID-RLOC mappings pulled from the
   Mapping System.

   There are several ways to keep this cache updated as described in
   [RFC6830].  Among them, the Solicit Map-Request (SMR) message allows
   to explicitly signal (P)ITRs to let them know that some of their
   cached mappings may be outdated.  However, vanilla LISP as described
   in [RFC6830] only considers SMR messages to be sent by an ETR.  This
   document extends [RFC6830] to cover the case where SMRs can be sent
   also by a Map Server (MS).

Internet-Draft             MS-originated SMRs             September 2015


   This document introduces changes in the MS specification allowing
   them to send SMR messages, however it does not require any
   modification in the (P)ITRs.  This document is backwards compatible
   and enables upgraded MS to interoperate via SMRs with legacy (P)ITRs
   that only implement [RFC6830].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Map Server extension

   This document enables MS to generate and send SMR messages towards
   (P)ITRs.  SMRs originated in a MS follow the same format described in
   [RFC6830].  Besides the fact that they are sent from a MS, there is
   no difference between an SMR originated in an ETR and one originated
   in a MS.

   When a MS generates an SMR, it uses as source-EID the EID-prefix it
   wants the (P)ITR to send the SMR-invoked Map-Request for.  The EID
   included in the EID-record field is the one belonging to the (P)ITR
   the MS sends the SMR towards.  As source locator for the SMR message,
   the MS uses one of its available locators.  This has implications in
   the processing of the SMR at the (P)ITR as described in Section 4

   When the MS has to send an SMR is implementation specific.  However,
   as specified in [RFC6830] and noted in Section 7, SMRs MUST be rate-
   limited.  It must be noted as well that, as described in Section 3, a
   MS that sends an SMR may not receive the SMR-invoked Map-Request that
   the (P)ITR generates as response to the SMR.

3.  Interoperability with legacy (P)ITRs

   This document introduces no changes in the specification of (P)ITRs
   and thus it is backwards compatible with legacy equipment only
   compliant with [RFC6830].  However, since SMRs were designed to be
   sent by ETRs, and legacy (P)ITRs expect to receive SMRs only from
   ETRs, the implications of sending SMRs from a MS are discussed in
   this section.

   As indicated in Section 2, the MS generates the SMR message using one
   of its locators as source locator.  However, this locator will not be
   present in the Locator-Set cached for that EID-prefix at the (P)ITR.
   Following [RFC6830], upon receiving the SMR message, the (P)ITR will
   check if the source locator is in the Locator-Set cached for that
   EID-record.  Since it is not, the (P)ITR will send the SMR-invoked

   Map-Request always to the Mapping System and never to the source
   locator of the SMR message.  This means that a MS can not force an
   SMR-invoked Map-Request to be sent directly towards itself.  However,
   it is possible that the Mapping System in use is instantiated (even
   partially) by the MS originator of the SMR.  In that case, it may be
   that the SMR-invoked Map Request will eventually reach the MS, either
   directly or after being internally forwarded through the Mapping
   System.

4.  Deployment considerations

   The extension defined in this document may be useful in scenarios
   where the MS wants to signal (P)ITRs about changes on mappings it is
   serving.  For instance, when the MS is keeping track of the (P)ITRs
   that are requesting its mappings and wants to inform them
   intermediately whenever a mapping is updated.

   SDN deployments that use LISP as a southbound protocol are
   particularly suitable to take advantage of this extension.  On the
   SDN scenario, mapping updates will unlikely come from ETRs, but
   rather from a centralized entity that pushes the updates directly to
   the Mapping System.  In such deployments, Map Servers will benefit
   from having a mechanism to inform directly (P)ITRs about updates in
   the mappings they are serving.

   Due to scalability and security concerns, it is RECOMMENDED that this
   extension is only applied in intra-domain scenarios where all LISP
   devices are within a single administrative domain.

   To limit the impact of the extension and to ease its integration with
   the rest of LISP signaling and operation, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   MS only sends SMR messages for those mappings it is proxy-replying
   for.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   As described in [RFC6830], the SMR messages and the SMR-invoked Map-
   Request MUST be rate-limited.  This does not change with the
   extension proposed in this document.

   The (P)ITRs receiving SMRs from the MS will send Map-Request messages
   to the Mapping System to retrieve authoritative mappings.  It is

   RECOMMENDED that the security mechanism described in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-sec] and [I-D.ietf-lisp-ddt] are in place to secure
   the mapping retrieval and protect against unsolicited messages or
   hijacking attacks.
