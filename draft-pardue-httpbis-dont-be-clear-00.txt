                  Reserving the clear ALPN Protocol ID
                 draft-pardue-httpbis-dont-be-clear-00

Abstract

   HTTP Alternative Services (Alt-Svc) are identified by a tuple of
   Application-Protocol Layer Negotiation (ALPN) protocol identifier, a
   host and a port.  The wire format for Alt-Svc is defined in ABNF and
   encodes this tuple or the keyword "clear", which has a special
   meaning.  This memo reserves the ALPN protocol identifier "clear" to
   reduce the chances of accidental aliasing with the "clear" keyword.

1.  Introduction

   HTTP Alternative Services (Alt-Svc) [ALTSVC] are identified by a
   tuple of Application-Protocol Layer Negotiation (ALPN) [ALPN]
   protocol identifier, a host and a port.  The wire format for Alt-Svc
   is defined in ABNF and encodes this tuple or the keyword "clear",
   which has a special meaning.  This memo reserves the ALPN protocol
   identifier "clear" to reduce the chances of accidental aliasing with
   the "clear" keyword.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Aliasing and Avoidance

   [ALTSVC] Section 3 defines the Alt-Svc header field using ABNF.  It
   requires a custom parser, which introduces a possibility for custom
   implementation errors.  The Alt-Svc header field value can either be
   the keyword "clear" - a special value that invalidates cached
   alternative services, or a list of "alt-value", that includes an
   encoded ALPN protocol identifier [ALPN].  There is a chance that
   someone unwittingly defines the ALPN protocol identifier "clear" for

   genuine purposes but is unaware of the use of protocol identifiers in
   Alternative Services.  This could trigger Alt-Svc parser errors that
   might lead to confusion between the keyword with the protocol
   identifier use.  Since the "clear" keyword has special meaning,
   confusion might lead to detrimental effects.

   To prevent unintended aliasing, this document registers the "clear"
   ALPN protocol identifier.  It relates to no actual application-layer
   protocol, effectively reserving the code point and preventing any
   unintended aliasing.

3.  Security Considerations

   Broken Alt-Svc header field parsers might confuse a "clear" keyword
   with a "clear" ALPN protocol identifier.  This could invalidate
   Alternative Service cache state but a conformant client should fall
   back safely as described in Section 2.4 of [ALTSVC].

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Registration of "clear" Identification String

   This document creates a new registration, "clear", in the
   "Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry
   established in [ALPN].

   The "clear" string is a reserved value that does not identify any
   protocol:

   Protocol:  Reserved

   Identification Sequence:  0x63 0x6C 0x65 0x61 0x72 ("clear")
