   1. Introduction

   This file is a proposal for P2P based Universal Resource Name
   resolution based on Internet draft --Distributed DNS Implementation
   in IpV6[lican].    

   In Internet, every resource needs an uniform name. There are RFCs
   URI[RFC2396] ,URL[RFC1738] and URN[RFC2611].  However, when there are
   more and more computers connected in Internet and more and more users
   use Internet, resources in Internet will be more and more. In this
   large, decentralized, distributed resource sharing environments today
   or in the future, the efficient discovery of static and/or dynamic
   resources (the dynamic resources are meant both in dynamic change of
   attributes or dynamic exist in the network) is a big challenge.


   The resource resolution based on Client/Server is not suitable for
   huge amount of resources. Here we argue that the resources can be
   classified as hierarchical Domains. It is nature way to use DNS to
   resolute resources. Although DNS implementation today may be scalable
   for translating Domain Names into IP addresses, it may  encounter
   problem if we use it to resolute huge amount resources today and even
   more amount resources in the future. The framework proposed here is
   suitable for the huge amount of resources' resolution, which is 
   based on  Distributed DNS  Implementation in IpV6[lican]  and on the
   paper-"Resource Discovery Based on VIRGO P2P Distributed DNS
   Framework"[LicanICCS].   



   2. Convention for Universal Resource Name
 


Huang, Lican           Expires January  13, 2010                [Page 3]

Internet Draft     Universal Resource Name Resolution      July 12, 2009


   The convention for resource name is formatted as global unique
   hierarchical domains like domain names in DNS, and a local name to
   specify the local attributes of resource name. The format of
   convention of resource names is as follows syntax: 

      functionscheme ":"global-hier-part"/"local-name

      The functionscheme is type or function or schema for the resource;
   the global-hier-part is the global hierarchical name similar as
   domain name and the local-name is the local name for the resource.

      for example,

         blog:Britney.popular.music/storyofBritney

         This is a resource name for a blog article about the story of
   Britney Spears

         song:Britney.popular.music/Lonely   

         This is a resource name for the song Lonely by Britney Spears.

         Britney Spears is classified as Britney.popular.music.  


   3. Universal Resource Name Resolution framework

   We treat global-hier-part in the invention of resource name as domain
   name. We also use the similar concept of DNS zone for DNS server to
   manage the domain names. For example. if a DNS server's zone is
   Science.Biology.Bioinformatics, then this DNS server manages all
   resource information under the catalogue of
   Science.Biology.Bioinformatics. In other case, if a DNS server's zone
   is Science.Biology, then this DNS server manages all resource
   information under the catalogue of Science.Biology, which may
   includes sub domains of BioInformatics , botany, zoology,etc.

   Resource names are published in their authoritative DNS server which
   keeps local domain RRs[RFC1035]. The extension RRs in DNS server
   contains the parts of the functionscheme and local-part of
   conventions of resource name. The local-part of resource can  be a
   URL for the other repository  which contains the resource metadata
   and/or other information. For example, the location information for
   blog:Britney.popular.music/storyofBritney is stored on the server of
   Britney.popular.music.  

   Every DNS server is the same but some coexist in more than one layer.
   Every DNS Server maintains a route table and  RRs related to its

Internet Draft     Universal Resource Name Resolution      July 12, 2009


   authoritative domain zone.  Route Tables in servers are the same as
   [lican].


   The DNS servers join virtual groups in VIRGO network as their
   authoritative domain names. When a DNS server joins, its route table
   will add some other nodes' entities, and some other nodes will update
   their route table by adding the joining node's entity. The detail of
   the algorithm can be  found in [lican]. 


   3.1 Universal Resource Name Resolution

   For the Universal Resource Name Resolution, we first locate the
   domain name server as[lican]. For example, to resolute resource
   "blog:Britney.popular.music/storyofBritney", we first locate the
   server Britney.popular.music, then in the server
   Britney.popular.music, we check its extension RRs for the resource
   blog:Britney.popular.music/storyofBritney for its location, etc.

   The query process is as the following: 

   User program sends QUERY MESSAGE, which contains SQL-like query
   statenment described in section3.1.1, to Local Name Server. If Local
   Name Server is the authoritative Domain Name Server, then the Local
   Name Server will check its extension  RRs to resolve the request
   resource. Otherwise, The Local Name Server will route to the Foreign
   Name Server which is closer to the authoritative Domain Name Server
   by calculating theoretical hops. Then the Foreign Name Server routes
   to the even closer Foreign Domain Name Server. Repeat this process,
   until the authoritative Domain Name Server has been found. Finally,
   the authoritative Domain Name Server resolves  request resource  by
   check its extension RR record, and responses to the Local Name
   Server. The latter will forward the response to the User Program. The
   details of the algorithm can be found [lican]. 


   3.1.1 SQL-like Query Language

   query::=SELECT{SCHEMA|SUBDOMAIN|ENTITY|ATTRIBUTE|*|expr[[AS]c_alias] 
         {,expr[[AS]c_alias]...}}        FROM domainref         [WHERE
   search_condition];

   Here, SCHEMA is for querying functionschema for a Domain;  SUBDOMAIN
   is for querying subdomain  for a given super Domain; ENTITY is for
   querying all entities  for a given search condition ; ATTRIBUTE is
   for querying all attributes  for a given search condition ;expr is
   for the property queried, which may be  a set of properties; [AS]

Internet Draft     Universal Resource Name Resolution      July 12, 2009


   c_alias is the alias name for expr; domainref is for Domain Name, in
   which we can use * to indicate all sub domains; search_condition is
   similar to SQL statement in Database.   

   In the following, there are several examples of query operations.

   Operation 1 

   The form "?:global-hier-part" is to query all functionschema of the
   global-hier-part domain. For example,  "?:Britney.popular.music"  
   queries all functionschema of Britney.popular.music.  We can use the
   following  Statement:

         SELECT  SCHEMA FROM Britney.popular.music;

   Operation 2

   The form "functionschema:global-hier-part/?" is to query all
   resources with the functionschema in the global-hier-parts domain.
   For example, "song:Britney.popular.music/?" queries all songs by
   Britney Spears. We can use the following Statement:

         SELECT  * FROM Britney.popular.music WHERE SCHEMA ='song';

   Operation 3

   Suppose that global-hier-part can be expressed as
   leafDomain.superDomain. The form "functionschema:?.superDomain/"  is
   to query all leafDomains. This is possible because of the
   hierarchical structure and the protocols. For example, 
   "song:?.popular.music" queries all popular singers. We can use the
   following Statement:

         SELECT SUBDOMAIN FROM *.popular.music WHERE SCHEMA ='song';

   Operation 4

   The form "functionscheme :global-hier-part/local-name" is to query
   specific resource.  For example, "song:Britney.popular.music/Lonely"
   queries the information of the song-Lonely. We can use the following 
   Statement:

         SELECT Lonely FROM Britney.popular.music WHERE SCHEMA ='song';


   Operation 5

   The form "functionscheme :global-hier-part/expression" is to query

Internet Draft     Universal Resource Name Resolution      July 12, 2009


   the resources which satisfy the conditions of the expression
   indicated.  Expression  can be scope, maximum, minimum, where
   condition like SQL statements. For example,
   "song:Britney.popular.music/where year between 2006 and 2007" queries
   all songs by Britney Spears which are produced between 2006 and 2007.
   We can use the following  Statement:

         SELECT * FROM Britney.popular.music WHERE SCHEMA ='song'AND
   Year >=2006 AND Year <=2007;

   Another example,  "hardware:cluster.computer.IT/max(cpu)"  queries a
   cluster  with maximum cpu numbers. We can use the following 
   Statement:

         SELECT max(cpu) FROM cluster.computer.IT WHERE SCHEMA
   ='hardware';





   3.1.2 SQL-like Maintanence Language

    The resources are maintained by the SQL-like maintenance language.
   Insert statement registers new resources into the domain. Delete
   statement drops the resource registration from the domain. Update
   statement changes the information registered in the domain. The
   formats of these statements are as the following:  

     DELETE FROM   domainref  [WHERE    search_condition];

     INSERT INTO   domainref[(entity.attribute{,  
   entity.attribute...})] {VALUES (expr | NULL {,expr |NULL...}) ;

     UPDATE domainref  SET entity.attribute = expr |NULL{,     
   entity.attribute =  expr|NULL ...};


     For example, the following statement deletes all songs by Britney
   Spears which are produced between 2006 and 2007.

       DELETE  FROM Britney.popular.music WHERE SCHEMA ='song'AND    
   year > 2006   AND   year < 2007;



   3.2  Hierarchical Management of global-hier-part

Internet Draft     Universal Resource Name Resolution      July 12, 2009


   To be a unique resource name for global scope, The Internet
   Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) may govern the
   root of global-hier-part in Universal Resource Name 
   organized by the users automatically. For example, in
   www.Madonna.popular.music, music  is managed by music virtual
   organization, which reports to ICANN to approve, popular.music   is
   controlled by  popular music virtual organization,which reports to
   music virtual organization to approve. The request of  
   www.Madonna.popular.music is sent to virtual organization of popular
   music to be approved. In   www.Beethoven.classic.music, classic.music
     is controlled by classic music virtual organization, which reports
   to music virtual organization to approve. The request of
   www.Beethoven.classic.music is managed by virtual organization of
   classic music.
