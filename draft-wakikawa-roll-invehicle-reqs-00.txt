Abstract

   This document presents the routing requirements for in-vehicle low
   power and lossy networks.  Automobiles are already equipped with
   several sensors and devices named Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for
   controlling, monitoring and entertainment, etc.  For the future in-
   vehicle networks, the shift to wireless is desirable due to heavy
   weight and volume of cables in vehicles and to be able to efficiently
   install devices.  However, with the limitation of low power, in-
   vehicle network still requires reliability and scalability in nature
   of the rolls of ECU.  The routing protocol should support the
   features of low-power, high-reliability, Subnetting, QoS, Mobility,
   etc.  This document briefly explains the in-vehicle networks and
   ECUs, then discusses the requirements for the future wireless in-
   vehicle networks.

1.  Terminology

   We define the following terms to explain the in-vehicle networks.
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

   Electronic Control Unit (ECU)

      ECU controls the driving and stability of the vehicle as well as
      managing usability, environmental input and safety.  The role of
      ECU is getting spread to the vehicle systems.  An ECU is connected
      to several sensors and actuators, which computes the input from
      sensors and acts accordingly to control vehicle's operation.  Most
      of vehicles can no longer be operated without these ECUs.  Several
      tens of ECUs are installed in each vehicle.

   Actuator

      Actuator is device to handle events of drivers, passenger and
      vehicles.  There are two different types of actuators: automatic
      and manual.  For instance, the wiper's actuator is triggered by an
      ECU when the driver controls the wiper's switch.  This manual
      actuator waits for physical action of drivers.  On the other hand,
      automatic light actuator turns on the lights when it gets dark.
      From the view of network, there aren't many differences.  We treat
      both manual and automatic as an actuator in this document.

   Sensor

      Sensors are distributed to every corner of vehicles.  Examples are
      fuel level sensors, tire air-pressure sensors, etc.  These sensors
      collect the required information of vehicle's status and send the
      sensed information to an appropriate ECU.  Rear-view and side-view
      cameras are also in this category.

   Gateway

      Gateway is used to inter-connect different bus systems in the in-
      vehicle networks.  This gateway translates the bus protocol if
      required.

   In-Vehicle Network

      The In-Vehicle network is designed to exchange the information and
      the commands between ECU, Actuator and Sensors.

   Figure 1 shows the relationship among an ECU, sensors, and actuators.

2.  Introduction of In-Vehicle Networks

   Automobiles are recently equipped with several devices which are used
   for driving control, stability control, usability management,
   environmental management, and safety management.  Electronic control
   unit (ECU) is a device to control automobile according to sensed
   information and actuator's actions.  In early 1970s, a few ECUs were
   initially installed in vehicles.  However, after advancements of IT
   technology, a typical vehicle now have about 100 ECUs and high-end
   vehicles have a few hundreds ECUs inside.  Several local area network
   technologies dedicated for vehicles have been introduced such as
   Local Interconnect Network (LIN) [LIN] and Controller Area Network
   (CAN) [CAN1] [CAN2].  As the number of ECUs grow, volume and weight
   of copper and fiber became a considerable problem for vehicle's
   performance.

   Small wireless systems such as IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.15.1 and IEEE
   802.15.3a have been standardized and are available in the market.  It
   is very natural to consider to shift to wireless in the in-vehicle
   networks.  Indeed, some of the sensors already have wireless
   capability.  For instance, the sensors for tires cannot be connected
   via wires due to obvious reasons.  Considering the fact that the in-
   vehicle network is now essential to vehicle control, shifting to the
   "wireless" in-vehicle network has become a serious option.

   This section introduces the in-vehicle bus system used by current
   vehicles and classifies the in-vehicle network into 5 different
   networks.

2.1.  In-vehicle BUS system

   The existing in-vehicle network consists of several different bus
   systems according to the system and its requirements.  The four
   different bus systems are introduced in this document.  Although the
   wireless system is not well-performed for some bus systems due to
   extremely high performance requirements, the goal of this document is
   to start activities towards the ultimate goal of replacing the all
   these bus systems by IP network in wireless.

   CAN

      Control Area Network (CAN) [CAN1] [CAN2] was standardized at ISO.
      CAN is often used for the powertrain network (see Section 2.2).
      The access control method of CAN is CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense
      Multiple Access/Collision Detection).  The priority based data
      transmission is supported.  The highest priority data can be
      transmitted without any delay.  The supported bandwidth is from
      10Kbps to 1Mbps.  The maximum numbers of nodes per bus is 16.

Internet-Draft       In-Vehicle Routing Requirements            May 2008


   LIN

      Local Interconnect Network (LIN) [LIN] is a low cost serial
      communication bus system often used for body networks.  It uses
      Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter/Serial Communication
      Interface (UART/SCI), master-slaves concept, and the automatic
      clock synchronization for devices (so that a crystal oscillator is
      not required).  The supported bandwidth is from 1Kbps to 20Kbps.
      The maximum number of nodes per bus is 16.

   FlexRay

      With the increasing number of ECUs, sensors and devices, the
      complexity and demands of in-vehicle network has become higher.
      Therefore, FlexRay [FlexRay] is being standardized by the the
      FlexRay Consortium.  The characteristics of FlexRay is higher
      bandwidth support, collision-free bus access, guaranteed message
      latency, fault-tolerance by using dual channels.  FlexRay can be
      used for any kind of system bus in a vehicle.  The maximum
      bandwidth is 10Mbps.

   MOST

      Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) [MOST] is designed for
      infotainment system in a vehicle.  Audio, Video and control data
      can be exchanged over the MOST bus.  The maximum bandwidth is
      about 20Mbps.  There is another specification for multimedia
      network named Audio Visual Communication-LAN (AVC-LAN) [AVC-LAN].

2.2.  Classification of In-Vehicle Networks

   The in-vehicle network can be classified into five different bus
   networks.  This section introduces the five bus networks and gives
   the network requirements.  Figure 2 is an example of an in-vehicle
   network.  The different bus systems are inter-connected by gateways
   (illustrated as GW in Figure 2).

                       Figure 2: In-Vehicle Topology

   Powertrain Network

      Engine ECUs, accelerator pedal assembly, valve control motors, air
      intake valve controller, etc. are connected to the powertrain
      network.  These ECUs receive the sensing information from
      acceleration sensors, O2 sensors, heat sensors, traction sensors
      and determine the action according to the information.  After the
      determination, the engine ECUs control the fuel injection
      actuator, ignition actuator, valve actuator, and so on.  The
      network requirement is extremely high.  The expected network
      latency is from a few hundreds usec to a few ten msec between ECU,
      sensors, and actuators.  The engine control is operated every 2 to
      6 msec.  Therefore, both sensors and actuators are accessed
      frequently.

   Chassis Network

      This network is mainly used for transmission control, traction
      control, Anti Lock Brake System(ABS), and suspension control, etc.
      By collecting the information from wheel speed sensors, height
      sensors, yaw sensors, engine revolution sensors, gear sensors,
      ECUs connected to the Chassis network activate the required
      actuators.  The expected network latency is within about 1 msec.
      The frequency of these operations are every 4 to 8 msec.

Internet-Draft       In-Vehicle Routing Requirements            May 2008


   Body Network

      This network is basically designed for door lock control, door
      window control, side mirror control, air-bag control, keyless
      entry control, tire pressure monitor, air conditioner control etc.
      In addition, when a driver control switches such as a light
      switch, an ECU takes appropriate action by controlling actuators
      over this network.  The requirement of network latency is relaxed
      to about 100 msec.  This latency is the average time for drivers
      not to get frustrated while waiting for the action after
      controlling switches.  Most of operation is carried out with
      event-driven traffic.  Note that the communication for the air-bag
      control is exception in this network.  Since this communication is
      directly related to the drivers' and passengers' safety, the
      network requirement is same as or even higher than the one of the
      powertrain network.  Body network connects Body ECUs, Air-Bag
      ECUs, Door ECUs, keyless system ECUs, immobilizer ECUs, Seating
      ECUs, etc.

   Infortainment Network

      Infotainment network is installed for navigation system, audio and
      visual systems, telematics related systems, electronic toll
      collection system, etc.  The network latency is not important for
      this network except for electronic toll collection system and
      hands-free cell-phone system.  For instance, about 100 msec is
      required for the hand-free cell-phone system.  On the other hand,
      the bandwidth requirement is higher than other networks due to the
      streaming data for audio and visual system and navigation systems.
      A few Mbps is required for these applications.  In near future,
      this network may be responsible for more role by combining with
      the Chassis and the powertrain networks.  For instance, vehicles
      may control the break system according to the map and navigation
      information.

   Drive Assistance Network

      Several drive assistance systems have been introduced to recent
      vehicles such as auto-parking system, back-view monitoring system,
      side-view monitoring system, cruise control system, night-view
      system and even future auto-driving system.  This driver
      assistance network is laid on top of above four networks like
      overlay fashion.  Therefore, requirements of the drive assistance
      network are based on the requirements of four networks.

   These five bus networks have different network characteristics.
   Therefore, it is difficult to design an in-vehicle network by using a
   single wireless technology. 802.15.1 can be a candidate for the



Wakikawa & Kuwabara     Expires November 30, 2008               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       In-Vehicle Routing Requirements            May 2008


   higher bandwidth requirements and fast network latency and 802.15.4
   can be used for non-critical connectivity but low-cost installation.
   Wired connectivity will be left due to the high network requirements
   and the importance of reliability.  Therefore, ROLL routing protocol
   should be able to run over different layer1 technologies.

   When the in-vehicle network is operated by IP network, subnetting
   support is desired.  Since different bus systems have specific tasks
   and network requirements, it is reasonable to divide the in-vehicle
   networks into several subnets (ex. five subnets in Figure 2).  In
   this document, we assume that the future IP-based in-vehicle network
   consists of several different subnets such as powertrain subnet, body
   subnet, chassis subnet, infotainment subnet, and drive assistance
   subnet.

2.3.  In-Vehicle Network Size

   This document considers typical cars and does not take commercial
   vehicles such as buses and cargo trucks into account.  Variety of
   cars are available on the market.  In general, cars are categorized
   into three classes such as compact class, sedan class, and SUV/VAN/
   Truck class.  The typical size of the three classes are shown in
   below.  The information below is available at the catalogues of
   Toyota Vitz(Yaris), LEXUS IS350RWD, and Toyota TUNDRA [TOYOTA-HP]
   [LEXUS-HP].

   o  Compact Class: 3.785x1.695x1.520 meter (Vitz)

   o  Sedan Class: 4.575x1.795x1.430 (IS350RWD)

   o  SUV/VAN/Track Class: 5.809x2.029x1.935 (TUNDRA)

   From the network point of view, many ECUs, sensors and actuators are
   installed in a smaller area compared to other ROLL scenarios.  The
   number of ECUs, sensors and actuators does not depend on the vehicle
   class, rather it depends on the number of vehicle's functionalities.
   Therefore, high-end cars are equipped with much more ECUs, sensors
   and actuators, while inexpensive vehicles have only a limited number
   of them for the basic functionalities.

Internet-Draft       In-Vehicle Routing Requirements            May 2008


3.  Routing Requirements of In-Vehicle Network

3.1.  Low Power

   Although each vehicle is equipped with a battery, not all the
   sensors, ECUs, and actuators are operated via battery.  Therefore,
   the ROLL routing protocol must save power consumption for these un-
   powered sensors, actuators, and ECUs.  It might be reasonable to
   operate routing protocol in the power saving mode only for these un-
   powered device.  Powered devices should assist the un-powered devices
   or take care of more functionalities than un-powered devices in the
   ROLL routing protocol.

3.2.  Path Reliability

   Reliability is the most important factor in in-vehicle networks.  The
   functionality of the in-vehicle network is directly related to the
   drivers' and passengers' safety.  The ROLL routing protocol SHOULD
   support high path reliability.  Passengers often carry big luggage,
   shopping bags, ski equipments in a vehicle.  These cabin baggage and
   even passengers become obstacles of the in-vehicle wireless networks.
   Therefore, the reachability might be varied dynamically depending on
   the number of passengers and the amount of baggage in each vehicle.
   The ROLL routing protocol MUST calculate the path regardless of these
   obstacles in the dense network.

   If a path failure occurs, the ROLL routing protocol SHOULD also
   recover the path with the similar network condition of the previous
   path.  If the path is used for the powertrain subnet, the new path
   SHOULD also meet the network requirements of the powertrain subnet in
   terms of latency and bandwidth, etc.

3.3.  Subnetting Support

   The in-vehicle network consists of several different bus systems at
   this moment.  The IP-based in-vehicle network consists of several
   subnets as we explained in Section 2.2.  Therefore, the ROLL routing
   protocol SHOULD support subnetting.  The ROLL routing protocol is
   capable of operating both intra- and inter- subnets.

   In addition, the ROLL routing protocol SHOULD be capable of
   subnetting-aware routing.  Each subnet and each device have specific
   purposes and different performance requirements as shown in Section
   2.2.  Moreover, the topology of each subnet might be different, for
   instance using star-like topology for powertraine network and using
   multi-hop topology for body networks, etc.  The ROLL routing protocol
   SHOULD be able to change the behavior or routing algorithm depending
   on subnets and their role.  Some subnets are calculated by the



Wakikawa & Kuwabara     Expires November 30, 2008              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft       In-Vehicle Routing Requirements            May 2008


   shortest-path-first, while the other subnets might be calculated by
   other metrics such as latency and reliability.

3.4.  QoS Support

   QoS support is similar requirement to the subnetting-aware routing
   described in Section 3.3, but QoS-aware routing indicates the path
   establishment is varied according to device's role.  For instance,
   latency sensitive communication SHOULD be prioritized than the other
   communications.  The path recovery scheme might be also different
   based on the role of the failed path.  The best-effort is not always
   enough for in-vehicle networks.

3.5.  Scalability

   A few hundreds ECUs, sensors and actuators are connected in the in-
   vehicle networks.  The number of such devices is expected to increase
   in the near future.  Since physical space for these devices is very
   limited as we explained in Section 2.3, the network density is also
   extremely high compared to other ROLL network scenarios.  The ROLL
   routing protocol SHOULD be scalable for the in-vehicle network.

3.6.  Latency

   Each ECU, sensor, and actuator is installed with a specific role and
   high performance requirements.  If the latency cannot be achieved, it
   may cause danger.  The usec-order latency is required in some
   scenarios, while the msec-order latency is the average requirements.
   Note that not all the devices operates wirelessly in the in-vehicle
   network.  This is because the usec-order latency is difficult to
   achieve with the current wireless technology.  Even if it is
   possible, the complexity and the reliability are still considerable
   issues.  The ROLL routing protocol SHOULD calculate the path which
   meets the latency requirements of each device.

3.7.  Network Convergence

   The ROLL routing protocol should be able to converge quickly after
   the path failure or node failures are occurred.  The failures should
   not impact the entire in-vehicle networks.  The local repair is
   preferable.

   When a driver cranks the engine up, the in-vehicle network should be
   established before vehicle's moving.  Note that the part of body
   network is always active regardless of engine's running (ex. during
   the parking period) because it needs wait for actions from the driver
   such as the keyless entry system, etc.

3.8.  Manageability

   Autoconfiguration is required for some parts of the in-vehicle
   network.  Although the critical part of subnets such as the
   powertrain and the chassis subnets are not managed dynamically, the
   infotainment and the body subnets should be extensible by users
   anytime.  For instance, there are cases where a user purchases a
   navigation system and installs it onto the vehicle by him/herself
   (i.e. not by dealer).  Moreover, the average life-cycle of a vehicle
   is about 10 years.  During this period, the network might be extended
   or updated.  The ROLL routing protocol should be extensible for new
   functions and devices.  Therefore, the ROLL routing protocol should
   support auto-configuration for easy installation of devices and
   extensibility.

   The ROLL routing protocol SHOULD NOT force autoconfiguration to all
   the devices in the in-vehicle network.  Some part of the in-vehicle
   network such as the powertrain subnet MUST be ready right after
   starting the engine.  The static configuration is preferable in terms
   of quick bootstrap, reliability and stability of networks.  The
   powertrain network is built-in and is installed only by vehicle
   manufacturers.  Most of the devices in the powertrain subnet is not
   going to shift to wireless due to the extremely high requirements and
   duties.

3.9.  Mobility

   Mobility is not required for in-vehicle network right now.  All ECUs,
   sensors and actuators are pre-installed by vehicle manufacturers and
   the placement is very stable in a vehicle.  However, if devices are
   un-wired in the future in-vehicle network, several devices such as
   navigation display and some switches can be moved in a vehicle.
   Thus, mobility support is optionally required for the ROLL routing
   protocol.

   Since each device cannot move widely due to the limit of vehicle
   spaces, topology change is not frequent depending on the wireless
   transmission range.  However, the path reliability and network
   latency will be varied due to the movements.  The ROLL routing
   protocol should detect such network conditions changes and update the
   topology to adequate condition for each device when necessary.

3.10.  Security

   In-vehicle network directly effects drivers' and passengers' safety.
   The security is extremely important.  Several low-level (L1 and L2)
   security mechanisms are employed for in-vehicle network.  From the
   routing point of view, a malicious node should not intrude the in-

   vehicle network and should not disturb the in-vehicle network.  To
   exclude such security vulnerability, the ROLL routing protocol SHOULD
   support encryption and authentication of devices.

   The security support is activated specially for wireless devices.
   Since not all the devices in vehicles are going to be wireless and
   some parts of network are hidden inside the vehicle's body, security
   support is not required to the entire in-vehicle network.  Security
   support sometime brings protocol complexity and protocol overhead.
   It is not acceptable if high network requirements cannot be achieved
   because of security support.  The physical level security approaches
   (securing powertrain network physically) are taken for some part of
   networks.
