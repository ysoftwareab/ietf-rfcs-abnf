1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

Internet Draft            CCAMP LMP MIB Module             March 3, 2004


2.  Introduction

   Current work is underway in the IETF to specify a suite of protocols
   to be used as a common control plane and a separate common measure-
   ment plane. Along with Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) [RFC3471], the Link
   Management Protocol [LMP], which primary purpose is to manage traffic
   engineering (TE) links, is one of the key components of this stan-
   dardization activity. Primary goals of LMP are the maintenance of the
   control channel connectivity, correlation of link properties, verifi-
   cation of data-bearing links and detection and isolation of link
   faults.

   We describe in this document a MIB module that can be used to manage
   LMP implementations. This MIB module covers both configuration and
   performance monitoring aspects of LMP.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, reference
   [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the Link
   Management Protocol [LMP]. An "LMP adjacency" is formed between two
   nodes that support the same capabilities, and LMP messages are
   exchanged between the node pair over control channels that form this
   adjacency. Several control channels can be active at the same time.
   With the exception of messages related to control channel management,
   any time a LMP message needs to be transferred to a neighbor node, it
   can be sent on any of the active control channels. The control
   channels can also be used to exchange MPLS control plane information
   or routing information.

   LMP is designed to support aggregation of one or more data-bearing
   links into a traffic-engineering (TE) link. The data-bearing links
   can be either component links or ports depending on their
   multiplexing capability (see [LMP] for distinction between port and
   component link).

   Each TE link is associated with an LMP adjacency, and one or more
   control channels are used to exchange LMP messages for a particular
   adjacency. In turn, control channels are used to manage the TE links
   associated with the LMP adjacency.

4.  Feature Checklist

   The Link Management Protocol MIB module (LMP-MIB) is designed to
   satisfy the following requirements and constraints:

   -  The MIB module supports the enabling and disabling of LMP
      capability on LMP capable interfaces of a photonic switch,
      optical cross-connect or router.

   -  The MIB module is used provide information about LMP adjacencies.

   -  Support is provided for configuration of the keep alive and
      link verification parameters.

   -  The MIB module is used to express the mapping between local and
      remote TE links, as well as local and remote interface identifiers
      for port or component link.

   -  Performance counters are provided for measuring LMP
      performance on a per-control channel basis. Performance counters
      are also provided for measuring LMP performance on the data-
      bearing links.

   Note that the LMP MIB module goes hand-in-hand with the TE Link (TE-
   LINK-STD-MIB) MIB module [TELINK-MIB]. The TE link table, which is
   used to associate data-bearing links to TE links, is defined in the
   TE Link MIB. The TE link table in the LMP MIB module contains TE link
   information specific to LMP.

5.  Outline

   Configuring LMP through an optical device involves the following
   steps:

   -  Enabling LMP on LMP capable interfaces through control channel
      configuration.

   -  Optionally specifying link verification parameters.

   -  Configuring the data-bearing links and associating them to the
      appropriate TE link (this association is stored in the
      ifStackTable of the Interfaces Group MIB).

   TE links are managed by the control channels that run between the
   same pair of nodes (LMP adjacency).

6.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   Sections 6.1-6.8 describe objects pertaining to LMP. The MIB objects
   were derived from the LMP document [LMP].

6.1.  lmpNbrTable

   The remote node table is used to identify the pair of nodes that
   exchange LMP messages over control channels.

6.2.  lmpControlChannelTable

   The control channel table is used for enabling the LMP protocol on
   LMP-capable interfaces. A photonic switch, optical cross-connect or
   router creates an entry in this table for every LMP capable interface
   in that device.

6.3.  lmpControlChannelPerfTable

   The control channel performance table is used for collecting LMP
   performance counts on a per-control channel basis. This table is an
   AUGMENT to the lmpControlChannelTable.

6.4.  lmpTeLinkTable

   The TE link table is used for specifying LMP information associated
   with TE links.

6.5.  lmpLinkVerificationTable

   The link verification table is used for configuring the LMP link
   verification parameters of TE links. This table is an AUGMENT to the
   lmpTeLinkTable.

6.6.  lmpTeLinkPerfTable

   The TE link performance table is used for collecting LMP performance
   counts on a per-TE link basis. This table is an AUGMENT to the
   lmpTeLinkTable.

6.7.  lmpDataLinkTable

   The data-bearing link table is used to specify the data-bearing links
   that are associated with TE links.

   The data-bearing link performance table is used for collecting LMP
   performance counts on data-bearing links.


7.  Example of LMP Control Channel Setup

   In this section we provide a brief example of using the MIB
   objects described in section 10 to set up an LMP control channel.
   While this example is not meant to illustrate every nuance of the
   MIB module, it is intended as an aid to understanding some of the
   key concepts. It is meant to be read after going through the MIB
   itself.

   Suppose that one would like to form an LMP adjacency between two
   nodes using two control channels. Suppose also that there are
   three data-bearing links. We also assume that the data-bearing
   links are ports (lambdas). We also assume that the link
   verification procedure is not enabled. The following example
   illustrates which rows and corresponding objects might be created
   to accomplish this.

   First, LMP must be enabled between the pair of nodes.

   In lmpNbrTable:
   {
      lmpNbrNodeId                       = 'c0010101'H, -- 192.1.1.1
      lmpNbrAdminStatus                  = up(1),
      lmpNbrRowStatus                    = createAndGo(4),
      lmpNbrStorageType                  = nonVolatile(3)
   }

   Then, the control channels must be set up. These are created in
   the lmpControlChannelTable.

   In lmpControlChannelTable:
   {
      lmpCcId                           = 1,
      lmpCcUnderlyingIfIndex            = 1,
      lmCcIsIf                          = false(1),
      lmpCcAuthentication               = false(1),
      lmpCcHelloInterval                = 15,
      lmpCcHelloIntervalMin             = 15,
      lmpCcHelloIntervalMax             = 1000,
      lmpCcHelloDeadInterval            = 45,
      lmpCcHelloDeadIntervalMin         = 45,
      lmpCcHelloDeadIntervalMax         = 1000,

Internet Draft            CCAMP LMP MIB Module             March 3, 2004


      lmpCcAdminStatus                  = up(1),
      lmpCcRowStatus                    = createAndGo(4),
      lmpCcStorageType                  = nonVolatile(3)
   }

   {
      lmpCcId                           = 2,
      lmpCcUnderlyingIfIndex            = 2,
      lmCcIsIf                          = false(1),
      lmpCcAuthentication               = false(1),
      lmpCcHelloInterval                = 15,
      lmpCcHelloIntervalMin             = 15,
      lmpCcHelloIntervalMax             = 1000,
      lmpCcHelloDeadInterval            = 45,
      lmpCcHelloDeadIntervalMin         = 45,
      lmpCcHelloDeadIntervalMax         = 1000,
      lmpCcAdminStatus                  = up(1),
      lmpCcRowStatus                    = createAndGo(4),
      lmpCcStorageType                  = nonVolatile(3)
   }

   Next, the three data-bearing links are created. For each data-
   bearing link, an ifEntry with the same ifIndex needs to be created
   beforehand.

   In lmpDataLinkTable:
   {
      ifIndex                         = 41,
      lmpDataLinkAddressType          = unknown(0),
      lmpDataLinkIpAddr               = ''H,
      lmpDataLinkRemoteIpAddress      = ''H,
      lmpDataLinkRemoteIfId           = 47,
      lmpDataLinkRowStatus            = createAndGo(4),
      lmpDataLinkStorageType          = nonVolatile(3)
   }

   {
      ifIndex                         = 43,
      lmpDataLinkAddressType          = unknown(0),
      lmpDataLinkIpAddr               = ''H,
      lmpDataLinkRemoteIpAddress      = ''H,
      lmpDataLinkRemoteIfId           = 42,
      lmpDataLinkRowStatus            = createAndGo(4),
      lmpDataLinkStorageType          = nonVolatile(3)
   }

   {
      ifIndex                         = 44,

Internet Draft            CCAMP LMP MIB Module             March 3, 2004


      lmpDataLinkAddressType          = unknown(0),
      lmpDataLinkIpAddr               = ''H,
      lmpDataLinkRemoteIpAddress      = ''H,
      lmpDataLinkRemoteIfId           = 48,
      lmpDataLinkRowStatus            = createAndGo(4),
      lmpDataLinkStorageType          = nonVolatile(3)
   }

   Note that the data-bearing link type (lmpDataLinkType) does
   not need to be provisioned as it is automatically populated by the
   node. The definition of the protection role (primary or
   secondary) for the data-bearing links is stored in the
   componentLinkTable of the TE Link MIB module [TELINK-MIB].

   Then, a TE link is created as an ifEntry with ifType teLink in
   the ifTable.

   Once the TE link is created in the ifTable, a TE link entry
   is created in the LMP MIB module to specify TE link information
   specific to LMP.

   In lmpTeLinkTable:
   {
      ifIndex                     = 20,
      lmpTeLinkVerification       = true(2),
      lmpTeLinkFaultManagement    = true(2),
      lmpTeLinkDwdm               = false(1),
      lmpTeLinkRowStatus          = createAndGo(4),
      lmpTeLinkStorageType        = nonVolatile(3)
   }

   and in lmpVerifyTable:
   {
      lmpVerifyInterval           = 100,
      lmpVerifyDeadInterval       = 300,
      lmpVerifyTransportMechanism = j0Trace(3),
      lmpVerifyAllLinks           = true(2),
      lmpVerifyTransmissionRate   = 100000,
      lmpVerifyWavelength         = 0
   }

   The association between the data-bearing links and the TE links is
   stored in the ifStackTable [IF-MIB].

   In parallel with the entry created in the lmpTeLinkTable, an entry
   may be created in the teLinkTable of TE Link MIB module
   [TELINK-MIB].

8.  Application of the Interfaces Group to LMP

   The Interfaces Group [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces. This memo contains the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing LMP control channels
   that are modeled as interfaces. If the control channel as defined in
   the lmpControlChannelTable is modeled as an ifEntry, then the
   following definition applies. An lmpControlChannelTable entry is
   designated as being represented as an Interfaces MIB ifEntry if the
   lmpControlChannelEntry object lmpCcIsIf is set to true (2). In this
   case, the control channel SHOULD be modeled as an ifEntry and
   provide appropriate interface stacking as defined below.

   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be
   in accordance with [RFC2863] which states that the interfaces table
   (ifTable) contains information on the managed resource's
   interfaces and that each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of
   a network interface is considered an interface. Since the LMP
   interface only carries control traffic, it is considered to be below
   the internetwork layer. Thus, the LMP interface may be represented
   as an entry in the ifTable. The inter-relation of entries in the
   ifTable is defined by Interfaces Stack Group defined in [RFC2863].

   When LMP control channels are modeled as interfaces, the interface
   stack table must appear as follows for the LMP control channel
   interfaces:

   +----------------------------------------+
   | LMP-interface ifType = lmp(TBD)        +
   +----------------------------------------+
   | Underlying Layer...                    +
   +----------------------------------------+

   In the above diagram, "Underlying Layer..." refers to the ifIndex
   of any interface type over which the LMP interface will transmit
   its traffic. Note that if the underlying layer provides multiple
   access to its media (i.e.: Ethernet), then it is possible to stack
   multiple LMP interfaces on top of this interface in parallel.

   Note that it is not a requirement that LMP control channels be
   modeled as interfaces. It is acceptable that control channels
   simply exist as logical connections between adjacent LMP-capable
   nodes. In this case, lmpCcIsIf is set to false(2) and no
   corresponding entry is made in the ifTable.

8.1.  Support of the LMP Layer by ifTable

   Some specific interpretations of ifTable for the LMP layer
   follow.

   Object        Use for the LMP layer

   ifIndex       Each LMP interface may be represented by an ifEntry.

   ifDescr       Description of the LMP interface.

   ifType        The value that is allocated for LMP is TBD.
                 This number will be assigned by the IANA.

   ifSpeed       The total bandwidth in bits per second for use by
                 the LMP layer.

   ifPhysAddress Unused.

   ifAdminStatus This variable indicates the administrator's intent
                 as to whether LMP should be enabled, disabled, or
                 running in some diagnostic testing mode on this
                 interface. Also see [RFC2863].

   ifOperStatus  This value reflects the actual or operational
                 status of LMP on this interface.

   ifLastChange  See [RFC2863].

   ifInOctets    The number of received octets over the interface,

-- Notification Configuration

lmpNotificationMaxRate OBJECT-TYPE
   SYNTAX       Unsigned32
   MAX-ACCESS   read-write
   STATUS       current
   DESCRIPTION
       "The LMP notification rate depends on the size of the network,
        the type of links, the network configuration, the
        reliability of the network, etc.

        When designing this MIB, care has been taken to minimize the
        amount of notifications generated for LMP purposes. Wherever
        possible, notifications are state driven meaning the
        notification are only sent when the system changes state.
        The only notifications that are repeated and could cause a
        problem as far as congestion is concerned are the ones
        associated with data link verification.
        Without any considerations to handling of these
        notifications, a problem may arise if the number of data
        links is high. Since the data link verification notifications
        can happen only once per data link per link verification
        interval, the notification rate should be sustainable if one
        chooses an appropriate link verification interval for a given
        network configuration. For instance, a network of 100 nodes
        with 5 links of 128 wavelengths each and a link verification
        of 1 minute with no more than 10% of the links failed at any
        given time would have 1 notification per second sent from
        each node, or 100 notifications per second for the whole
        network. The rest of the notifications are negligeable
        compared to this number.

        To alleviate the congestion problem, the
        lmpNotificationMaxRate object can be used to implement a
        throttling mechanism. It is also possible to enable/disable
        certain type of notifications.

        This variable indicates the maximum number of
        notifications issued per second. If events occur
        more rapidly, the implementation may simply fail to
        emit these notifications during that period, or may
        queue them until an appropriate time. A value of 0
        means no throttling is applied and events may be
        notified at the rate at which they occur.
        Implementations should save the value of this object in
        persistent memory so that it survives restarts or reboot."

11.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   -   Unauthorized changes to the lmpNbrTable, lmpControlChannelTable,
       lmpTeLinkTable and lmpDataLinkTable may disrupt allocation of
       resources in the network.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   -   The lmpNbrTable exposes network provider's node IP addresses.

   -   lmpControlChannelTable exposes network provider's control
       network.

   -   lmpDataLinkTable exposes network provider's data network.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   George Wang.

13.  IANA Considerations

   Each of the following "IANA Considerations" subsections requests IANA
   for a new assignment. New assignments can only be made via a
   Standards Action as specified in [RFC2434].


13.1.  IANA Considerations for lmp ifType

   The IANA is requested to assign TBD ifType for LMP interfaces.


13.2.  IANA Considerations for LMP-MIB

   LMP-MIB should be rooted under the transmission subtree. The IANA is
   requested to assign { transmission TBD } to the LMP-MIB module
   specified in this document. The IANA is requested to use same number
   as the lmp ifType.
