ABSTRACT

This memorandum discusses the use of the Internet Print Protocol 
[IPP] as a facsimile service. IPP has most of the functional 
attributes necessary to be a successful real time facsimile 
service on the Internet with little or no modification to the 
core IPP V 1.0 protocols [IPP-MOD] [IPP-PRO]. 

IPP compliance with the legal and general custom and practice 
surrounding General Switched Telephone Network [FAX] will require 
some modification to the behavior of IPP clients and the common 
usage of time/date stamping on local IPP device transactions and logs.

INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


1.0 INTRODUCTION

Facsimile [FAX] has a long and successful tradition as a 
telephony application for sending a document from one 
client/terminal device to another. At a sufficient level of 
abstraction, the concept of FAX could be considered a "remote 
printing" technology. Therefore, it is worth reviewing the 
various aspects of what work has been done to date to define 
service objectives for facsimile over IP networks and 
specifically identify those elements of IPP that match those 
needs.

2.0 OVERVIEW OF FACSIMILE SERVICES

2.1 TRADITIONAL FAX

Traditional facsimile as defined by the ITU [T.30] is a 
connection oriented technology between two client/terminal 
devices over the GSTN (Global Switched Telephone Network). It is 
specifically a "point to point" service where the end point is an 
address defined by an ITU [E.164] telephone number. The content 
types specified by T.30 are highly restricted due to the lack of 
available bandwidth available on the analog GSTN, typically 
limited to 14.4Kpbs, but standards do exist to support up to 
28.8Kpbs.

2.2 IETF FAX SERVICE

For Information on IETF-FAX work group:

http://www.imc.org/ietf-fax

The Internet Fax service [IFAX][RFC 2305] has developed within 
the IETF as using SMTP. With SMTP there are two functional 
elements, a Message Transfer Agent (MTA) and a Message User Agent 
(MUA). The MTA's and MUA's are operating in a Client-Server / 
Store and Forward.

IFAX adds significant functionality to facsimile services by 
integrating with other SMTP services, such as the Voice Profile 
for Internet Mail [VPIM2], in a concept often referred to as 
"Universal Messaging". [RFC 2301] introduces several advanced 
content types, including higher resolution Black & White and 
several types of color files that, for practical reasons, would 
be impossible to transmit over the GSTN. Current work within the 
IETF-FAX work group [EIFAX] defines some essential features for 


SHOCKEY			Expires April 1999		[Page  2]


INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


reporting and receipt notification using Disposition Service 
Notification - Message Disposition Notification [DSN-MDN], as 
well as some outlines for client/device capabilities negotiation.

2.3 ITU FAX

The ITU (International Telecommunications Union) has taken two 
approaches to defining an Internet Fax service. 

2.3.1 ITU STORE-AND-FORWARD FAX

In the first instance it has adopted the body of IETF 
IFAX work [RFC 2301-2306 inclusive] and defined it as [T.37]. 

2.3.2 ITU REALTIME FAX

The ITU has also defined a "real time" Internet fax standard as 
well, now documented as [T.38].  T.38 tunnels under [H.323] to 
establish capabilities exchange and reporting, then uses RTP 
(Real Time Protocol) to deliver the content payload.  Though a 
discussion of the merits of H.323 is beyond the scope of this 
document, H.323 was originally designed for real time voice and 
video and could be considered overkill for a relatively simple 
application such as real time confirmed document transmission 
(facsimile).

In addition T.38 does not define a destination addressing scheme
for transactions, such as a phone number or a URL. The scope of 
T.38 is limited only to the transport of supported fax content
over IP networks.  

T.38 is gaining acceptance specifically in the IP Telephony 
Gateway market oriented towards carriers. The requirements for 
H.323 in the Voice over IP market allows T.38 to be easily 
implemented as an "add on" to VoIP at very little incremental 
cost.

3.0 END USER REQUIREMENTS FOR A FACSIMILIE SERVICE

3.1 IETF-FAX GOALS

The document "Terminology and Goals for Internet Fax" [GOALS] 
describes the general system functional requirements for an 
Internet Fax service. 

To Quote directly from GOALS:

INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


{Begin Quote}

Traditional facsimile has a simple user operational model; 
the user

  1) inserts paper into a device
  2) dials a number corresponding to the destination 
  3) presses the 'start' button on the device 
  4) the sending device connects to the receiving device
     using the telephone network
  5) the sending device scans the paper and transmits the 
image of the paper
  6) simultaneously, the remote device receives the 
transmission and prints the image on paper
  7) upon completion of transmission and successful 
processing by the recipient, the sending user is notified 
of success

Although not usually visible to the user, the operation (5) 
of transmission consists of

 5a) negotiation: the capabilities of the sender and 
recipient are exchanged, and suitable mutually acceptable 
parameters for the communication are selected
 5b) scanning: creating digitized images of pages of a 
document
 5c) compression: the image data is encoded using a data 
compression method
 5d) transmission: the data is sent from one terminal to 
the other
 
In addition, the termination of operations (5d) and (6) may 
be characterized as consisting of:

 6a) completed delivery: the message has completed 
transmission 
 6b) completed receipt:  the message has been accepted by 
the recipient
 6c) processing and disposition: the message has been 
processed

3.1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FAX

In addition to the above specifications there are additional 
requirements for Sender/Recipient Identification Exchange, 
time/date stamping, and optional "watermarking" of each page of 
the FAX transmission required by law in the United States 
and several other countries (see LEGAL ISSUES below). 

Of these specifications, there is a substantial body of market survey 
research (Pitney-Bowes/Gallup) that indicates that 
Confirmation/Receipt is considered the most useful feature of 
traditional fax. 

3.1.1 CONFIRMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR FAX

The end user requirements for confirmation and receipt must
contain the information you typically find in the transaction 
report from a conventional fax machine or fax server.
  
This includes, but is not limited to:

1. MUST record status of transaction 
	(success, failure, cause of failure)
2. MUST record date and time of all attempts 
	(log files recorded at each end by client and server locally)
3. MAY record Duration of call(s)
4. MAY record number of pages transferred
5. MUST exchange and record client or server identification

As a general rule, end user expectations for an Internet 
Facsimile service are driven by the perceptions of, if not 
necessarily the reality of, traditional GSTN FAX.

3.2 IPP GOALS 

 For Information on the IETF-IPP work group:

 http://www.pwg.org/ipp

The document "Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol", 
draft-ietf-ipp-req-02.txt, June, 1998 [IPP-REQ] outlines the 
design goals for IPP and identifies some specific end user 
requirements.

{quote}

 	END-USER

SHOCKEY			Expires April 1999		[Page  5]


INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998

An end-user of a printer accepting jobs through the 
Internet is one of the roles in which humans act.  The end-
user is the person that will submit a job to be printed on 
the printer.

The wants and needs of the end-user are broken down into 
six categories: finding/locating a printer, creating a 
local instance of a printer, viewing printer status, 
viewing printer capabilities, submitting a print job, 
viewing print job status,

{end quote}

3.3 IPP - FAX - IFAX  

Based on the requirements of both an Internet Fax Service and the 
Internet Print Protocol it seems that on the most basic level 
their are significant similarities from the perspective of the 
end user.

FAX/IFAX Message Addressing = IPP Finding/Locating 
	a printer [URL Addressing]
FAX/IFAX Message Creation = IPP Creating the Print File 
	[Supported MIME Content Type or "Payload"]
FAX/IFAX Message Transmission = IPP Submitting a Print-Job
FAX/IFAX Message Confirmation (Receipt) = IPP Client Poll
	for Print-Job Status

4.0 OBSERVATIONS ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IPP and FAX/IFAX SERVICES

4.1 INTEROPERABILITY

IPP has developed interoperability mappings to 
other print services, such as TLS, but it currently 
has no explicit methodology to allow  supported IPP
MIME Content-Types to interoperate with different fax
services, such as SMTP or GSTN FAX. It is assumed that URL's 
could be devised to facilitate interoperability between these 
services. (see IPP TO GSTN GATEWAY CONCEPTS).

An IPP transaction destined for a GSTN gateway might be addressed 
as:

http://domain.com/ipp/FAX=13149189015  

Where the number is a fully qualified ITU E.164 number conforming 
to the IFAX gateway specifications outlined in [RFC2304] and 
[RFC2305].


SHOCKEY			Expires April 1999		[Page  6]


INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


Further study will be necessary to investigate proper schemes for 
the addressing of gateways in an IPP environment.

4.2 DATA FORMATS (CONTENT PAYLOAD)

IPP and FAX/IFAX take two fundamentally different approaches to 
the content payload of a message. FAX limits its content to the 
image files specified by the [T.30] protocol. IFAX limits its 
Content-Type to a highly defined set of TIFF images specified in 
RFC2301 and specifically limits Content-Type to a subset of TIFF 
defined in RFC2306 in the event that the capabilities of the 
recipient is not known in advance.

The rational for this has been that TIFF has historically been
used in the GSTN-FAX and that by defining a similar type of 
content for IFAX, the goal of service interoperability is 
advanced.

IPP has none of these restrictions. IPP is limited only 
to Registered MIME Content-Types supported by of the output
device or service preformed by the IPP server for the 
recipient. This is facilitated by content negotiation 
during the IPP session setup.

IPP may wish to consider the mandated support of RFC2306
by both clients and servers as a Least Common Denominator 
to facilitate interoperability in a Facsimile Service Mode.

4.3 ADDRESSING

Both IPP and IFAX use commonly understood addressing schemes well 
known among Internet users.

IFAX uses SMTP addressing.

IPP uses URL's.

IPP has the ability to allow multiple URL's to access a single 
output resource such as:

http://domain.com/ipp/rshockey
http://domain.com/ipp/mickey_mouse
http://domain.com/ipp/printer42

These separate addresses might output to a single printer in much 
the same way a single FAX number is available to several 
individuals. This capability is purely dependent on the 
implementation of the IPP server. 

SHOCKEY			Expires April 1999		[Page  7]


INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


4.5 CAPABILITIES EXCHANGE

FAX devices negotiate and exchange capabilities during the call 
setup of T.30. Information is passed between devices through the 
use of highly defined "frames" of data. Such data exchange 
includes such attributes as page size, resolution, speed of 
transmission and identity of terminal devices (T.30-CSID).
	
A severe limitation of the current IFAX service is the lack of 
any method by which Message User Agents can exchange capabilities 
in advance of sending a message. In such circumstances, the use 
of Least Common Denominators [RFC 2306] has been recommended in 
RFC 2305. Further work [EIFAX] is addressing those issues.

IPP Protocols for reliable negotiation and download of 
unavailable printer drivers in IPP are currently out of scope for 
IPP V1.0, but it is assumed that subsequent versions of IPP will 
address this problem.

The IETF and World Wide Web Consortium [www.w3.org] are looking 
at a variety of schemes to permit clients and servers to exchange 
data on capabilities. Work in the IETF is continuing in the 
CONNEG WG. 

4.6 IDENTITY EXCHANGE

The identity of senders and recipients in traditional FAX are 
achieved through the legal requirements for fax (see LEGAL ISSUES 
below) and the exchange of T.30 CSID frames between terminal 
devices "on the wire" during T.30 session negotiation.

IFAX uses E-Mail header information to identify the sender to the 
recipient. The recipient has no requirement to exchange data.

IPP has no formal capability to exchange identity data between 
sender and recipient, beyond the IPP URL.

The use of [vCARD] in IPP to facilitate this should be considered.

4.7 TRACKING AND CONFIRMATION

Traditional FAX uses In-Band monitoring to signal the sender when 
a document transmission has completed or report on any errors 
encountered.




SHOCKEY			Expires April 1999		[Page  8]


INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998



Both FAX sender and receiver have internal clocks that monitor 
the progress of that transaction and log the data in an 
appropriate manner.

IFAX is currently developing a variety of options for tracking 
the progress and delivery of a document using standard Internet 
Mail methodologies such as Message Disposition Notification [MDN-
RFC2289] and Disposition Service Notification [DSN-RFC 1891, 
RFC1894]

IPP offers a comprehensive suite of attribute options for 
monitoring the success or failure of a Job-Submission.

IPP Clients track and confirm the success or failure of 
Job-Submission by polling the IPP server for the status 
of a transaction, however polling the server for status
by the IPP client is not mandated.

The IPP work group is proceeding on a more advanced suite of 
Notification Attributes [IPP-NOT] to permit notification by a 
variety of means, such as E-Mail, on success or failure of Output 
of IPP Job after successful submission.

4.8 TIME/DATE INFORMATION

FAX terminal devices all have internal clock devices for 
recording the time/date of transactions. Actual time information 
is not exchanged "on the wire". Each device notes when it sends 
and receives documents and logs those transactions locally.

All E-Mail transactions have time/date information located in the 
E-Mail headers.

IPP does suffer from the lack of an explicit requirement for 
time/date stamping of transactions by either client or server. 
This will severely limit its use as a facsimile service and 
transmissions will not meet the legal requirement [see LEGAL 
ISSUES below] for a "fax". It will be necessary for IPP 
implementers to consider the installation of real time clocks in 
their devices or use of Time Protocol or Daytime Protocol [RFC 
867/868] to implement time/date stamping.

4.9 SECURITY, AUTHORIZATION AND AUTHENTICATION

On the surface, it would seem that no one would want to make his 
or her printer available on the Internet. 


SHOCKEY			Expires April 1999		[Page  9]


INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


It should be noted, however, that we have globally accessible 
printers available now. They are just called fax machines. 

The use of IPP as both a Remote Printer application and as a 
Facsimile Delivery Service, may cause some confusion in the mind 
of end users on what is and what is not "acceptable use".

IPP can use the security service available in Digest 
Authorization within in HTTP 1.1 [RFC2069] to authorize 
a client log in to a IPP server.

Additional study on the behavior of IPP clients/servers 
is may be needed on what types of IPP transactions should 
be available to all outside users vs authorized users only.

5.0	IPP and FAX/IFAX PROTOCOL MAPPINGS NECESSARY FOR GATEWAY 
INTEROPERABILITY

Though IPP has the functional attributes to be a facsimile 
service it may be necessary to consider interoperating with 
the existing GSTN FAX or IFAX service in the future.

Detailed mapping of the various attributes and structures will be 
necessary. Fortunately considerable groundwork is being 
undertaken in the IETF FAX WG to describe and detail those 
attributes. Among the attributes that will need to be mapped:

Architecture
Data Formats (MIME Content-Types): Such as RFC 2301-RFC2306
Print Resolution: 100x200, 200x200, 400x400 etc
Compression: MH, MR, MMR, JBIG, JPEG
Page Counts
Capabilities Discovery
Error Codes

The following documents describe ongoing work in the IETF-FAX 
work group that should be of considerable assistance in FAX/IPP 
attribute and syntax mapping:

[CONNEG-FEATURE-SYNTAX] draft-ietf-conneg-feature-syntax-XX.txt.

[FAX-SCHEMA] draft-ietf-fax-feature-schema-XX.txt.

INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


6.0 IPP ADVANTAGES AS A FACSIMILE SERVICE 

6.1 CONTENT 

IPP offers the end user a rich set of options for the creation 
and delivery of documents. Essentially any Page Description 
Language [Printer Driver] supported by the recipients' server 
could process the transaction and output the document. 

Though there is no mandated Least Common Denominator for 
IPP Clients and Servers , there is also no functional limitation 
on IPP output.

Were future versions of IPP to support the legal requirements for 
identification and time/date marking [see LEGAL ISSUES below] IPP 
would be perceived a facsimile service by end users. Once end 
users transmit documents across domains, the obvious similarity 
to traditional FAX should become self-evident.

6.2 NOTIFICATION AND RECIEPT	

[IPP-MOD] and [IPP-PRO] contain the basic facilities to be able 
to monitor the submission of an IPP-Job in real time. 

The current state of IPP Notification is not dissimilar to the 
function of [DSN] and [MDN]. Currently IPP V1.0 can monitor the 
submission of an IPP Job but it cannot notify the sender whether 
the job was actually processed. This is similar to the function 
of DSN in the SMTP service where notification takes place when 
the message reaches the "last hop" server but cannot notify the 
sender if or when the recipient picks up their mail via a MUA.

MDN does provide actual notification when a message was viewed by 
the recipient and could be considered similar to current IPP work 
on notification of output status.

IPP V.1 does not mandate the client polling of the server for 
status, however since notification and receipt are central 
requirements of any facsimile service, such polling would be a 
requirement for IPP when used in a Facsimile Service Mode.

6.3 POINT TO POINT ORIENTATION

IPP has the advantage of being an "end to end" protocol. The end 
user experience, as well as the real time nature of IPP, is very 
similar to GSTN-FAX.
 


SHOCKEY			Expires April 1999		[Page  11]


INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


6.4 ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS 

The use of IPP as a facsimile service offers end users 
significant economic advantages. Though GSTN Long Distance 
charges are continuing to drop, one of the most significant costs 
in FAX is the necessity to maintain dedicated and often expensive 
local lines. These charges, which average nearly US $30.00 per 
month [$360.00 yearly], and are significantly higher in Europe 
and Asia for business customers. These costs now represent one of 
the highest factors in calculating the Total Cost of Ownership of
Fax. The attraction of IPP is that once the fixed cost of an IP Network 
have been implemented within an enterprise the incremental cost 
of adding additional IP application services to the Network is 
marginal. 

7.0 IPP SHORTCOMINGS AS A FACSIMILIE SERVICE

7.1.1 IFAX GATEWAY CONCEPTS

The concepts for gateways in IFAX are described in GOALS: 

a)Fax onramp gateway
A device that can accept a facsimile telephone call and 
automatically forward it via the Internet

b)Fax offramp gateway
A device that can accept a transmission from the 
Internet and forward it to a traditional fax terminal

[sender]-IPP->[offramp]-PSTNFax->[fax-term]

With these concepts in mind, there is a potential role for IPP as 
a Gateway protocol to transport the documents across the Internet 
to multiple services.

a)IPP onramp gateway
A device or server that can accept an IPP document 
transaction from either a facsimile telephone call or an 
IFAX SMTP transaction.

b)IPP offramp gateway
A device or server than can accept an IPP transaction and 
forward it to either a GSTN FAX device or an IFAX SMTP 
transaction. 



SHOCKEY			Expires April 1999		[Page  12]


INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


c)IPP disconnected gateway
A device or server that can accept an IPP transaction and 
forward it to an IPP output device that is periodically 
disconnected from the Internet 

7.1.2 IPP GATEWAY SCENERIOS

There could be several scenarios for the role of IPP in 
Gateways.

[fax-term]-PSTNfax->[onramp]-IPP->[recipient]

[fax-term]-PSTNfax->[onramp]-IPP->[offramp]-PSTNFax->[fax-
term]

[POP3Client]-SMTP-IPP_onramp->recipient

[sender]-IPP_offramp->SMTP-[POP3Client]

[sender]-IPP>IPP server>SMTP_offramp>[recipient]

[sender]-IPP>IPP server>PSTN_offramp>[recipient]


7.2 TIME/DATE RECORDING

IPP does not have explicit requirements or attributes 
to express time/date information within transactions 
or transaction logs.

The time/date of FAX transactions are locally recorded
 by each FAX client/terminal.

IPP clients and servers will have to begin recording such 
transactions.


7.3 IPP AUTOMATIC DRIVER DISTRIBUTION

Currently there is lack of support for automatic printer driver 
distribution during an IPP transaction. 

Though no minimum printer driver format is specified in IPP, it 
would not be unreasonable for implementers to consider mandating
support of standard RFC 2301 or RFC 2306 MIME Content-Types to 
facilitate universal interoperability as well as facilitate 
the use of IPP as a gateway to GSTN FAX or redirect job output 
to the SMTP IFAX service. 



SHOCKEY			Expires April 1999		[Page  13]


INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


7.4 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION ISSUES

The installation and configuration of an IPP service will require 
significant knowledge and expertise on the part of system 
administrators. It will be necessary to configure figure network 
firewalls to support the standard IPP port of 631.

8.0 LEGAL ISSUES

The use of IPP as an Internet Facsimile Service must attempt to 
accommodate the legal requirements for GSTN facsimile.

The legal use of FAX for document transmission and receipt is 
well understood in US Case Law.

There is some evidence to suggest that Courts in the United 
States view the transmission of information and documents 
independently of the protocols and methodology used to achieve  
those means. The US Courts recognize that new technology is 
introduced very rapidly and that in many cases procedural rules 
have not kept pace. There is every reason to believe that if 
IPP is used in the context of a facsimile service and "best efforts" 
are taken to duplicate the "look and feel" of GSTN FAX and 
satisfy the legal requirements customary in FAX, IPP 
transactions will be accorded the full support and protection 
of law.

8.1 UNITED STATES LAW	

The United States Federal Communication Commission regulations 
and US Federal Law (47 USC 227) state:

{quote}

   "Identification Required on Fax Messages

    The FCC's rules require that any message sent to a fax 
machine must clearly mark on the first page or on each page 
of the message:
-  the date and time the transmission is sent;
-  the identity of the sender; and
-  the telephone number of the sender or of the 
sending fax machine. 





SHOCKEY			Expires April 1999		[Page  14]


INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


All fax machines manufactured on or after December 20, 1992 
and all facsimile modem boards manufactured on or after 
December 13,1995 must have the capability to clearly mark 
such identifying Information on the first page or on each 
page of the Transmission."

{end quote}

Of particular note is that there is no requirement that the marks 
for identifying information be placed on every page. The legal 
requirement is only for the first page, though it has become 
custom and practice among all FAX device manufacturers to include 
the "watermark" on each page transmitted.

8.2 WATERMARKING OF PAGES

This marking of the pages in FAX is commonly referred to as 
"watermarking" of the transmission. These marks are typically 
placed at the top of each page of the fax transmission and 
contain time/date information, sender identification [typically 
T.30 CSID frame data] and page number information. The sender's 
device creates this data at the moment the transaction begins. 
The recipient output device does not modify the document once it 
is received.

Though this requirement, and similar ones in many countries, 
applies only when the transmission occurs over the GSTN, it seems 
reasonable to assume that various national authorities will 
extend this requirement to the Internet as facsimile traffic is 
taken off the GSTN.

IPP Facsimile Mode implementations will have to insert 
these watermarks into the supported PDL MIME Content-Type.

9.0  COVER PAGES

Closely associated with the legal issues are the formats and 
requirements for cover pages.

9.1 TYPICIAL DATA

Cover pages on facsimile transmissions typically contain the 
following data:





SHOCKEY			Expires April 1999		[Page  15]


INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


Identification of Sender:
Identification of Recipient:
Time/Date of Transmission:
Number of pages in Transmission:
Comment Field:

9.2 IPP JOB SEPERATOR SHEETS

IPP currently has a facility for the automatic generation of 
pages by the IPP server to separate  Job-Submissions, however 
there are currently no IPP attributes that would permit IPP 
client definitions of the Job-Seperator sheets to conform to
 either the legal or general custom and practice of facsimile 
cover sheets.


10.0 COMMON FACSIMILIE CLIENT INTERFACE MODELS

Most end user FAX interfaces fall within two categories. A client 
workstation device, typically a personal computer with a modem or 
attached to a LAN Fax server and appropriate software, or a 
client terminal device with some form of scanner imput. These 
terminal devices would be the typical fax machine or 
multifunction peripheral.However, the options available on 
these client interfaces have evolved in different ways because 
of the unique nature of the facsimile service.

10.1 CLASSIC FAX DEVICES

Classic FAX terminal devices offer only a limited number of 
options for end users. Typically, these functions are for higher 
or lower resolution, gray scaling etc. It is assumed that the 
document to be faxed is already in paper form. In addition, they 
usually offer no options for automatic cover page generation 
since it is assumed that the end user will manually fill out some 
form of fax cover page and simply add it to the pages to be 
transmitted.  

The Classic FAX terminal device adds the legal "watermarks" to 
the top of each of the pages transmitted but in no other way 
alters the document.

10.2 FAX SOFTWARE

Fax software has evolved differently. In addition to the usual 
options provided for resolution and gray scaling and the 


SHOCKEY			Expires April 1999		[Page  16]


INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998


watermarking of pages, workstation fax software has traditionally 
offered options for automatic cover page generation, document 
management, alternate transmission times and a variety of other 
useful functions. The document transmitted is directly converted 
to fax form by the workstation application through the use of a 
special printer driver in much the same manner as IPP.
It should be noted that there has been a substantial and active 
Computer Fax Industry for nearly 10 years. Market survey research 
has consistently shown that only 15% of total pages transmitted 
in North America are generated by workstations, and an even 
smaller percentage of faxes are received by workstations or LAN 
Fax Servers.

11.0 IPP CLIENT BEHAIVOR IN A FACSIMILE SERVICE MODE

11.1 IPP CLIENT BEHAIVOR

IPP clients, in a facsimile service mode, need only duplicate the 
essential "look and feel" of GSTN FAX client/devices . IPP 
terminal devices with scanner input options could offer the 
option of watermarking each page of the document as is currently 
customary in FAX.  IPP Client software could optionally offer 
Cover Page Generation and other features, as the market deems 
appropriate.  No additional protocol requirement or burdens are 
necessary in IPP [IPP-MOD/IPP-PRO] itself.

11.2 IPP SERVER BEHAVIOR

IPP attributes for time/date should be developed in order to 
permit IPP servers to properly log transactions in a facsimile 
service mode. Time/date recording is an essential part of 
notification.

12.0 CONCLUSIONS

IPP has all of the functional elements to be a superior facsimile 
service over the Internet. It is superior to IFAX fax-over-SMTP 
[RFC2505] and superior to fax-over-H.323 [T.38] for both the end 
user and for the device implementor. 

It is a better FAX than GSTN FAX.

It is my judgement that IPP transactions, once they cross 
domains, will be perceived by end users as a "facsimile service" 
irrespective of what the goals and objectives of the IPP protocol 
designers were.

INTERNET DRAFT		IPP as a Facsimile Service	November 1998



Getting a document from "here to there" over the wire will be 
perceived as "fax". It will not make any difference whether the 
transaction is GSTN FAX, SMTP, or IPP protocols. 

IPP can achieve the "look and feel" of FAX with the 
additions of time/date stamping of sender/recipient transaction 
logs by each local IPP device, IPP Client watermarking of each 
page of the transmission in the customary manner of FAX and cover 
page creation options in future IPP Client software or firmware.

IPP has most of the functional specifications, as well as 
attributes necessary to successfully map to the existing RFC 2305 
Internet Fax service through, at the very least support of RFC 
2306 and optionally RFC 2301 Content-Types. 

13.0 ACTION RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the concepts and conclusions discussed in this 
memorandum, work could commence to define IPP as a facsimile 
service and outline protocols for interoperability between IPP 
and GSTN FAX, as well as RFC2305 and its successors [EIFAX].

Several work items are recommended.

A. Document Goals and Objective for the use of Internet Print 
Protocol as a facsimile service.

B. Document IPP Client/Server Profile when used in a Facsimile 
Service Mode especially IPP enhancements necessary to support 
time/date stamping of all transactions.

C. Document Gateway Protocol Mapping between IPP and FAX/IFAX 
for Onramps and Offramps. 

D. Document IPP to FAX/IFAX URL gateway syntax.

E. Investigate possible requirement to support RFC2306 
as a Least Common Denominator by IPP clients and servers 
when operating in a Facsimile Service Mode.

F. Continue established work in IPP Notification enhancements.
