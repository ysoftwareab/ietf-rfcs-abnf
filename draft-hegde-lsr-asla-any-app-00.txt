   The Application Specific Link Attribute (ASLA) Any Application Bit
                    draft-hegde-lsr-asla-any-app-00

Abstract

   RFC 8919 and RFC 8920 define Application Specific Link Attributes
   (ASLA).  Each ASLA includes an Application Identifier Bit Mask.  The
   Application Identifier Bit Mask includes a Standard Application Bit
   Mask (SABM) and a User Defined Application Bit Mask (UDABM).  The
   SABM and UDABM determine which applications can use the ASLA as an
   input.

   This document introduces a new bit to the Standard Application
   Identifier Bit Mask.  This bit is called the Any Application Bit
   (i.e., the A-bit).  If the A-bit is set, the link attribute can be
   used by any application.  This includes currently defined
   applications as well as applications to be defined in the future.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8919] and [RFC8920] define Application Specific Link Attributes
   (ASLA).  Each ASLA includes an Application Identifier Bit Mask.  The
   Application Identifier Bit Mask includes a Standard Application Bit
   Mask (SABM) and a User Defined Application Bit Mask (UDABM).

   Each bit in the SABM represents a standard application while each bit
   in the UDABM represents a user defined application.  If a bit in the
   SABM or UDABM is set, the corresponding application can use the ASLA
   as an input.  If a bit in the SABM or UDABM is not set, the
   corresponding application cannot use the associated ASLA as an input.

   According to [RFC8919]:

   "If link attributes are advertised associated with zero-length
   Application Identifier Bit Masks for both standard applications and
   user-defined applications, then any standard application and/or any
   user-defined application is permitted to use that set of link
   attributes so long as there is not another set of attributes

   advertised on that same link that is associated with a non-zero-
   length Application Identifier Bit Mask with a matching Application
   Identifier Bit set."

   This restriction introduces complexity.  For example, assume that a
   network runs many applications.  All applications use Attribute 1 as
   an input.  So, it would be convenient to advertise Attribute 1 with a
   zero-length SABM / UDABM.

   However, Applications X and Y also use Attribute 2 as an input.
   Because Applications X and Y required unique values for Attribute 2,
   Attribute 2 cannot be advertised with a zero-length SABM.  Therefore,
   Attribute 1 cannot be advertised with a zero-length SABM / UDABM
   either, because Applications X and X require it.

   This document reduces operational complexity by introducing a new bit
   to the Standard Application Identifier Bit Mask.  This bit is called
   the Any Application Bit (i.e., the A-bit).  If the A-bit is set, the
   link attribute can be used by any application.  This includes
   currently defined applications as well as applications to be defined
   in the future.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The Any Application Bit

   A new bit is defined in the Standard Application Identifier Bit Mask.
   This bit is called the Any Application Bit (i.e., the A-bit).  If the
   A-bit is set, the link attribute can be used by any application.
   This includes currently defined applications as well as applications
   to be defined in the future.

   If a link advertises an ASLA twice, once with the A-bit set and once
   with a more specific Application Identifier Bit set, the indicated
   application MUST use the value from the ASLA with the more specific
   Application Indicator Bit set.

3.1.  IS-IS

   IS-IS uses Bit 4 of the SABM to encode the A-bit.

3.2.  OSPF

   OSPF uses Bit 4 of the SABM to encode the A-bit.

4.  Backward Compatibility

   The solution described in this document is backward compatible with
   [RFC8919] and [RFC8920].  An implementation that does not recognize
   the A-bit will process the SABM as specified in [RFC8919] and
   [RFC8920].

   Implementations MAY advertise attributes under both A-bit and with
   SABM and UDABM length set to zero for backward compatibility reasons.
   When same attributes are received with A-bit set as well as in ASLA
   with SABM and UDABM set to zero, the attributes MUST be used from the
   ASLA with SABM and UDABM set to zero and procedures described in
   [RFC8919] sec 6.2 MUST be followed.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations discussed in [RFC8919] and [RFC8920] are
   applicable to this document.  This document does not introduce any
   new security risks.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA add the following entry to the
   registry titled "Link Attribute Application Identifiers" under the
   "Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) Parameters" registry:

   *  Bit: 4

   *  Name: Any Application (A-bit)

   *  Reference: This document
