Abstract

   This document extends the INCH XML incident reporting format for
   reporting phishing, fraud, widespread spam, and other non-network
   layer attacks and incidents.  The extensions are an outgrowth of the
   Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) activities in data collection and
   sharing.  Although we use the term "phishing attack", the data format
   extensions are flexible enough to support information gleaned from

   activities throughout the entire phishing life cycle and extensible
   enough to be used for other types of electronic crime incidents such
   as fraud.  The extensions support very simple reporting as well as
   optional fields for detailed, forensic reports and supports single
   phish/fraud incidents as well as consolidated reports of multiple
   phish incidents.

Internet-Draft        IODEF Fraud Report Extensions            June 2005


1.  Introduction

   Deception activities, such as Phishing and fraud, are an expanding
   attack types in the Internet.  For this document we use the two terms
   interchangeably and characterize both attack types as broadly-
   launched social engineering attacks in which an electronic identity
   is misrepresented in an attempt to trick individuals into revealing
   their personal credentials ( e.g., passwords, account numbers,
   personal information, ATM PINs).  A successful phishing attack on an
   individual allows the phisher (i.e., attacker) to exploit the
   individual's credentials for gain.  Early phishing attacks were
   directed at individuals via email as a ruse from a bank security
   department, requesting the user's ATM number and PIN.  Once phished,
   the bank account could be used by the phisher to perpetrate
   additional fraud, money laundering, or plain emptying of the account.
   As individuals become aware of phishing tactics, the phishers have
   evolved into using more complex and stealthier technologies, and have
   targeted institutions other than banks.  Other miscreants are also
   using these same techniques for other types of attacks.

1.1  Why a Common Report Format is Needed

   The rise in phishing and fraud activities via e-mail, instant
   message, DNS corruption, and malicious code insertion has driven
   corporations, Internet Service Providers, consumer agencies, and
   financial institutions to begin to collect and correlate phishing
   attack information to better plan out mitigation activities and to
   assist in prosecution.  Early on it became obvious that a common
   format for the data reported or exchanged between these parties was
   necessary and the IETF INCH XML format was selected for this use.
   Although originally designed for network-layer incident sharing
   (e.g., DoS attacks, compromised computers) the INCH format can be
   extended quite easily to support other incident profiles, as we have
   done.

   The use of a common format will also help organizations integrate
   multiple product outputs into a cohesive single attack view and will
   allow for the introduction of advanced services such as wholly
   automatic local notifications and usable data mining.

   The accumulation and correlation of information is very important
   when dealing with security incidents.  In phishing attacks the source
   of the attack may be forged and it's quite possible that the targeted
   organization may not even be aware of the ongoing attack.  Parties
   aware of the attack may wish to notify the target, or an
   organization's internal monitoring systems may detect the attack and
   wish to take mitigation steps.  Unfortunately, there is no recognized
   standard way of expressing the detection of a phishing attack nor an

Internet-Draft        IODEF Fraud Report Extensions            June 2005


   acceptable way to exchange the required information.  For an
   organization that employs multi anti-phishing technologies,
   correlating data from multiple vendors or products is close to
   impossible as the data is reported in multiple, mostly incompatible,
   formats.

   This document defines a data format that is used to capture relevant
   information from a phishing attack and shared, correlated, or to
   populate a database.  Additionally, the use of products that export
   information in this format will allow an organization to correlate
   and analyze phishing information across their organization, in effect
   information sharing with themselves.  Although targeted at both the
   accumulation of phishing attack information from a single institution
   and a means of sharing attack information between cooperating
   parties, the actual information sharing process and related political
   challenges are not covered in this document.

1.2  Relation to the INCH IODEF Data Model

   Instead of defining report format and language from scratch, the
   phishing activities information is encoded as an extension to the
   INCH incident exchange format.[INCH]The use of an already existent
   and operational format allows for quicker vendor adoption and reuse
   of existing tools in organizations.  To reduce duplication and to be
   compatible with modifications to the base IODEF definitions, this
   document only identifies additional structures; The reader is
   expected to have a copy of the IODEF documents handy while reading
   this one.

   One criticism of the INCH format is that it is too cumbersome (large
   and complex) to be used in an efficient manner for something as
   simple as fraud events.  The goal of all common formatting is to be
   efficient when necessary and also to allow enough data to be included
   to provide a complete picture of the event.  The INCH format has very
   few required elements to allow for efficiency, but allows extremely
   verbose elements to be used if supporting data is available.  This
   flexibility allows the INCH formats to be used in a wide range of
   event reports but allows the product developer to only be required to
   support one format standard.

1.2.1  The INCH Extensions for Fraud

   In general, an INCH incident report contains detailed incident-
   specific data which populates an EventData Structure.  That data is
   then incorporated, either singularly or in aggregation, with
   additional summary and contact data, into an Incident structure.  The
   populated Incident structure is what is reported as a Fraud Activity
   Report.

Internet-Draft        IODEF Fraud Report Extensions            June 2005


   Unsavory phishing activity may include multiple email messages,
   attacks, or events, scattered over various times, locations, and
   methodologies.  As each of these activities may generate multiple
   reports to an incident team, the Fraud Activity Report is composed of
   one XML Incident element, recording one or more individual phishing
   events and may include multiple EventData elements.

   This document defines new attributes for the EventData and Record
   Item IODEF XML elements, then identifies attributes that are required
   in a compliant Fraud Activity Report.  The Appendices contain sample
   Fraud Activity Reports and the complete Document Type Definition.

   The IODEF Extensions defined in this document comply with section4,
   "Extending the IODEF Format" in [INCH].

   Internet-based Phishing and Fraud activities are normally comprised
   of at least four components.

   1.  The Fraudster, or the party perpetrating the fraudulent activity.
   Most times this party is not readily identifiable.

   2.  The Attack Source, where the phishing email, virus, trojan, or
   other attack is generated.

   3.  The User or intended target of the fraud/phish.

   4.  The collection point, where the victim sends their credentials or
   personal data if they have been duped by the phisher.

   If we take a holistic view of the attack, there are some additional
   components:

   5.  The network sensor, which is some thing that detects the fraud/
   phish attempt or success.  This element may be an Intrusion-Detection
   System, Firewall, Filter, email gateway, or even a human.

   6.  A forensic or archive site where an investigator has copied or
   otherwise retained the data used for the fraud attempt or credential
   collection.

3.  Fraud Actvitiy Reporting via an IODEF-Document Incident

   A Fraud Activity Report is an instance of a IODEF-Document XML
   Incident element[INCH] with added EventData and AdditionalData
   elements.  Some required information with many optional items are
   populated into the new structure to form a Fraud Activity Report.  To
   facilitate completeness, the report originator should fill out as
   much as possible of the optional Incident element fields, but SHALL
   stay consistent with the IODEF-Document structure.

   This document defines new EventData IODEF XML elements; then
   identifies attributes that are required in a compliant Fraud Activity
   Report.  The Appendices contain sample Fraud Activity Reports and the
   complete XML Document Type Definition and schema.

   The Incident element with fraud extensions is summarized below and
   provides a standardized representation for commonly exchanged
   incident data and associates a CSIRT assigned unique identifier with
   the described activity.

   A Fraud Activity Report is composed of one INCH Incident element,
   containing one or more EventData elements that contain one or more

   Incident or EventData attributes.  We also define some additional
   attributes in the INCH Incident.EventData element to capture
   electronic mail header and routing information.

   One Incident report may contain information on multiple incidents.
   After the report identification information listed in the Incident
   element, each individual event is detailed within a single EventData
   structure.

4.  PhraudReport Element Definitions

   A PhraudReport consists of an Extension to the Incident
   AdditionalData Element.  The elements of the PhraudReport will
   identify and capture information related to the four components of a
   fraud activity.  Other forensic information and commentary can be
   added by the reporter as necessary to show relation to other events,
   the output of an investigation, or for archival purposes.  A
   PhraudReport element is structured as follows.

4.2  Identifying A Fraud campaign

   At times it may be useful to identify a specific phish or fraud for
   future analysis -- much like the Anti-Virus Vendors identify certain
   viruses.  A specific phish/fraud can be identified using a
   combination of the FraudType, FraudParameter, and PhishRefName
   elements.

4.2.1  FraudType Parameter

   ENUM.  The FraudType attribute contains a number representing the
   type of fraud attempted.  The Email element has been separated into
   multiple numbers to support the primary types of email.

   1.  PhishEmail, and the FraudParameter is the email subject line of
   the phishing email.  This type is a standard email phish, usually
   sent as spam, and is intended to derive financial loss to the
   recipient.

   2.  RecruitEmail, and the FraudParameter is the email subject line of
   the phishing email.  This type of email phish does not pose a
   potential financial loss to the recipient, but covers other cases of
   the phish and fraud lifecycle.

   3.  MalwareEmail, and the FraudParameter is the email subject line of
   the phishing email.  This type of email phish does not pose a
   potential financial loss to the recipient, but lures the recipient to
   an infected site.

   4.  Fraudsite, no FraudParameter.  This identifies a known fraudulent
   site that does not necessarily send spam lures.

   5.  DNSspoof, with the malware name as a parameter.  This is used for
   a spoofed DNS (e.g., malware changes localhost file so visits to
   www.example.com go to another IP address).

   6.  Keylogger, with the malware name as the FraudParameter.

   7.  OLE, no parameter.  This identifies background OLE information.

   8.  IM.  The subject line parameter may be the malicious link
   supplied to the user.

   9.  CVE, with the CVEnumber as the FraudParameter.

   10.  SiteArchive, with the data archived from the phishing server
   placed in the ArchiveInfo element.

Internet-Draft        IODEF Fraud Report Extensions            June 2005


   11.  Spamreport.

   12.  Unknown.

   When a FraudParameter is required, it is one of the following values:

   SubjectLine element

       STRING.  This is the subject line of the email lure.Note that
       some phishers add a number of random characters onto the end of a
       phish email subject line for uniqueness; reporters should delete
       those characters before insertion into the PhishParameter field.

   MalwareName element

       STRING.  This is the name of the malware that installed the
       keylogger or DNSspoofer.

   CVENumber element

       STRING.  This is the CVEidentifier of this exploit used to phish.


4.2.2  LureSource Element

   SOURCE.  Many times the phishing, spam, or fraud lure email is
   received from a spoofed IP address.  If the real IP Address can be
   ascertained it should be populated into this field.  A spoofed
   address may aso be entered, but the spoofed attribute SHALL be set.
   The field is an Address Element to allow for support of IPv6 and port
   numbers.

4.2.3  PhishNameRef Element

   STRING.  This value can be agreed upon by vendor collaboration to
   note a common name for a given phish attack or "campaign".  The
   agreed upon identifier could be useful in collaboration, support,
   media and public education.

4.2.4  PhishNameLocalRef Element

   STRING.  Many contributors will have a local reference name or
   Unique-IDentifier (UID) that will be used before a commonly agreed
   term is adopted in PhishNameRef.  The allows a cross-reference from

4.3  FraudedBrandName Element

   STRING.  This is the identifier of the recognized brandname or
   company name used to launch the phishing activity.  Some schemes,
   such as those enticing mules for money laundering or related
   activities, may use a lesser known or fictitious brand [e.g., xyz
   semiconductor company].  Those brand identifiers should also populate
   this field.

4.4  The Data Collection Site Element (DCSite)

   This section identifies the type, identifier, collection location,
   and other pertinent information about the credential gathering
   process by the fraudster.

   If the DCSite element is present, the DCSiteType element is required.
   There may be multiple DCSiteData elements.

      3.  IP Address, with the DCSitePointer field holding the IP
      Version Protocol, IPAddress, and Port number of the collection
      site.  The Protocol field defaults to TCP, if absent.  This
      collection site uses other protocols to gather data from the
      victim.

      4.  Unknown.


4.4.2.2  DCSitePointer Element

   DCSitePointer is one of the following, depending on the DCSiteType
   parameter.

       URI Site URL.

       STRING Email Site

       SOURCE.  This element contains the Protocol type, version,
       IPAddress, IP Protocol, and Ports list.


4.5  OriginatingSensor Element

   This section defines the identification and cognizant data of the
   network element that detected this fraud activity.  Note that the
   network element does not have to be in the Internet itself (i.e., it

       number of the entity that generated this report.


4.5.5  Location Element

       STRING.  This isan optional location of the sensor.


4.6  TakeDownInfo Element

   This element identifies information regarding the disablement of the
   phish or fraud collector site and contains information regarding the
   party blocking or removing the site.  A FraudReport may have multiple
   TakeDownInfo elements to support activities where multiple agencies
   are active.  Note that the term "Agency" is used to identify any
   party performing the blocking or removal -- such as ISPs or private
   parties -- not just governmental entities.

   |                   |<>---(0..1)--[ ArchivedDataComments ]
   +-------------------+

   The element is used to typecast and include a gzip archive file of a
   data collection site, base camp, or other site where the phisher
   developed their code.  This element will be populated when, for
   example, an ISP takes down a phisher's web site and has copied the
   site data into an archive file.  There are three types of archives
   currently supported, as specified in the type filed.

4.7.1  Type Parameter

   This parameter specifies the contents of the archive.

       1.  Data Collection Site.

       2.  Basecamp Site.

       3.  Sender Site.

       4.  Unspecified.


4.7.2  ArchivedDataURL Element

       URL.  This is the URL where the gzip archive file is located.
       [As archives are quite large, a Fraud Report just points out
       where the archive is, and does not include it in the report.]


4.7.3  ArchivedDataComments Element

       STRING.  This field is a free form area where one can comment on
       the archive and/or URL, if they so please.

4.8  RelatedData Element

   URL.  These are non-phish web sites that are related to this incident
   (e.g., victim site, etc).

4.9  CorrelationData Element

   STRING.  Any information that correlates this incident to other
   incidents can be entered here.

4.10  PRComments Element

   STRING.  Comments specific to this phishing activity that does not
   fit in any other field.

4.11  EmailRecord Element

   Extensions are also made to the INCH IODEF Incident EventData element
   to support descriptive information received in phishing lure or spam
   emails.  The ability to report spam is included within a PhraudReport
   to support exchanging information about large-scale spam activities,
   not necessarily a single spam message to a user.  As such the spam
   reporting mechanism was not designed to minimize overhead and
   processing.

   Information related to the overall fraudulent activity is contained
   within the PhraudReport, while the EmailRecord element is used to
   capture forensic or detailed technical information about a specific
   attack.  Incident Reports may have none, one, or multiple
   EmailRecords as its goal is to accumulate pertinent technical data
   associated with an specific attack as an investigation continues.

       This is the IP Version, Address, and port of the site originating
       the phish or spam email and is inserted into the LureSource
       element.  Multiple EMailOrigIP elements are supported and encoded
       as Address elements.


4.11.3  EmailHeader Element

       STRING.  The headers of the phish email are included in this
       element as a sequence of one-lined text strings.  There SHALL be
       one EmailHeader element per mailRecord


4.11.4  EmailBody Element

       STRING.  The body of the phish email is included here.  If
       present, there should be at most one EmailBody element per
       EmailRecord


4.11.5  EmailComments Element

       STRING.  Comments or relevant data not placed elsewhere about
       this email may be added in this text field.

5.  IODEF Required Elements

   A Fraud Report requires certain identifying information, which is
   contained within the standard IODEF Incident data structure.  The
   following table identifies attributes used in a Fraud Activity Report
   and their obligation.  Note that the Required column notes attributes
   required by the base IODEF Incident element.  Attributes identified
   as required SHALL be populated in conforming phishing activity
   reports.

   The following table is a visual description of the required fields.

5.3  Guidance on Usage

   It may be apparent that the mandatory attributes for a phishing
   activity report make for a quite sparse report.  As incident
   forensics and data analysis require detailed information, the
   originator of a FraudReport should include any tidbit of information
   gleaned from the attack.  Information that is considered more
   sensitive than public can be marked to a higher sensitivity using the
   restriction parameter of each data element.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies the format of security incident data.  As
   such, the security of transactions containing the incident report
   will vary from organization to organization.  We do not want to
   burden the information exchange with unnecessary encryption
   requirements, as the transport service for the data exchange may
   provide adequate protections, or even encryption.  The use of
   encryption is expected to be agreed upon on originator-recipient
   agreement.

   The critical security concern is that phishing activity reports may
   be falsified or the report may become corrupt during transit.
   Applying a digital signature on each report will counteract both of
   these concerns, but again the signature may be overkill for most
   activity report users.  For this reason, phishing activity reports
   SHOULD be digitally signed with the optional IODEF XML signature,
   although we expect that each receiving entity will determine the need
   for this signature independently.  Generators of phishing activity
   reports SHOULD digitally sign each report.

   Originators of fraud activity reports SHOULD digitally sign their
   report with the XML signature as described in[INCH].

   Recipients of fraud reports SHALL be prepared to accept XML digitally
   signed reports and SHOULD support receiving encrypted reports.
