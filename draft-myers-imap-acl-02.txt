Internet DRAFT                    ACL                       June 3, 1996


1.   Abstract

   The ACL extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4]
   permits access control lists to be manipulated through the IMAP
   protocol.

2.   Conventions Used in this Document

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

3.   Introduction and Overview

   The ACL extension is present in any IMAP4 implementation which
   returns "ACL" as one of the supported capabilities to the CAPABILITY
   command.

   An access control list is a set of <identifier,rights> pairs.

   Identifier is a US-ASCII string.  The identifier anyone is reserved
   to refer to the universal identity (all authentications, including
   anonymous).  All user name strings accepted by the LOGIN or
   AUTHENTICATE commands to authenticate to the IMAP server are reserved
   as identifiers to refer to the corresponding user.  All other
   identifier strings have implementation-defined semantics.

   Possible variations of identifier interpretation include, but are not
   limited to:

   * Named groups of users, presumably managed by some
     authorization service.

   * A prefix to the identifier specifying an "authentication
     type".

     As an example, an implementation may control posting to a group
     based on the contents of the From: header:

     from$user             p

   * Whether the union of rights for matching identifiers are granted
     to a user or whether the rights for the most specific matching
     identifier is granted.

     As an example, for a mailbox with the following ACL:

     user                  lrsa
     group-user-is-in      lrsw



J. Myers                                                        [Page 2]

Internet DRAFT                    ACL                       June 3, 1996


     One implementation may grant the user 'lrswa' rights, another
     may only grant the user 'lrsa' rights.

   * A prefix to an identifier name specifying the listed rights
     are to be removed from users who match the prefixed identifier.

     As an example, for a mailbox with the following ACL:

     group-user-is-in      lrsw
     -user                 w

     An implementation may grant the user 'lrs' rights.

   Rights is a string listing a (possibly empty) set of alphanumeric
   characters, each character listing a set of operations which is being
   controlled.  Letters are reserved for ``standard'' rights, listed
   below.  Digits are reserved for implementation or site defined
   rights.  The standard rights are:

   l - lookup (mailbox is visible to LIST/LSUB commands)
   r - read (SELECT the mailbox, perform CHECK, FETCH, PARTIAL,
       SEARCH, COPY from mailbox)
   s - keep seen/unseen information across sessions (STORE \SEEN flag)
   w - write (STORE flags other than \SEEN and \DELETED)
   i - insert (perform APPEND, COPY into mailbox)
   p - post (send mail to submission address for mailbox,
       not enforced by IMAP4 itself)
   c - create (CREATE new sub-mailboxes in any implementation-defined
       hierarchy)
   d - delete (STORE \DELETED flag, perform EXPUNGE)
   a - administer (perform SETACL)

   An implementation may tie rights together or may force rights to
   always or never be granted.  For example, in an implementation that
   uses unix mode bits, the rights "wisd" are tied, the "a" right is
   always granted to the owner and is never granted to another user.  If
   rights are tied in an implementation, it should be conservative in
   granting rights in response to SETACL commands--unless all rights in
   a tied set are specified, none should be used.

4.   Commands


4.1. SETACL

   Arguments:  mailbox name
               authentication identifier
               access rights

   Data:       no specific data for this command

   Result:     OK - setacl completed
               NO - setacl failure: can't set acl
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The SETACL command changes the access control list on the
      specified mailbox so that the specified identifier is granted the
      permissions enumerated in rights.


4.2. DELETEACL

   Arguments:  mailbox name
               authentication identifier

   Data:       no specific data for this command

   Result:     OK - deleteacl completed
               NO - deleteacl failure: can't delete acl
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The DELETEACL command removes any portion of the access control
      list for mailbox for the specified identifier.


4.3. GETACL

   Arguments:  mailbox name

   Data:       untagged responses: ACL

   Result:     OK - getacl completed
               NO - getacl failure: can't get acl
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The GETACL command returns the access control list for mailbox in

      an untagged ACL reply.

   Example:    C: A002 GETACL INBOX
               S: * ACL INBOX Fred rwipslda
               S: A002 OK Getacl complete


4.4. LISTRIGHTS

   Arguments:  mailbox name
               authentication identifier

   Data:       untagged responses: LISTRIGHTS

   Result:     OK - listrights completed
               NO - listrights failure: can't get rights list
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

Example:    C: a001 LISTRIGHTS ~/Mail/saved smith
            S: * LISTRIGHTS ~/Mail/saved smith la r swicd
            S: a001 OK Listrights completed


            C: a005 LISTRIGHTS archive.imap anyone
            S: * LISTRIGHTS archive.imap anyone "" l r s w i p c d a 0 1
            2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
            S: a005 OK Listrights completed

      The LISTRIGHTS command takes a mailbox name and an identifier and
      returns information about what rights may be granted to the


4.5. MYRIGHTS

   Arguments:  mailbox name

   Data:       untagged responses: MYRIGHTS

   Result:     OK - myrights completed
               NO - myrights failure: can't get rights
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The MYRIGHTS command returns the set of rights that the user has
      to mailbox in an untagged MYRIGHTS reply.


   Example:    C: A003 MYRIGHTS INBOX
               S: * MYRIGHTS INBOX rwipslda

5.   Responses



5.1. ACL

   Data:       mailbox name
               zero or more identifier rights pairs

      The ACL response occurs as a result of a GETACL command.  The
      first string is the mailbox name for which this ACL entry applies.
      This is followed by zero or more pairs of strings, each pair
      contains the identifier for which the entry applies followed by
      the set of rights that the identifier has.


5.2. LISTRIGHTS

   Data:       mailbox name
               identifier
               required rights
               list of optional rights

      The LISTRIGHTS response occurs as a result of a LISTRIGHTS
      command.  The first two strings are the mailbox name and
      identifier for which this rights list applies.  Following the
      identifier is a string containing the (possibly empty) set of
      rights the identifier will always be granted in the mailbox.

      Following this are zero or more strings each containing a set of
      rights the identifier may be granted in the mailbox.  Rights
      mentioned in the same string are tied together--either all must be
      granted to the identifier in the mailbox or none may be granted.

      The same right may not be listed more than once in the LISTRIGHTS
      command.


5.3. MYRIGHTS

   Data:       mailbox name
               rights

      The MYRIGHTS response occurs as a result of a MYRIGHTS command.
      The first string is the mailbox name for which this ACL entry

      applies.  The second string is the set of rights that the client
      has.


6.   Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) notation as specified in [RFC-822] as modified by [IMAP4].
   Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by
   [IMAP4].

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are
   case-insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to
   define token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations
   MUST accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.


   acl_data        ::= "ACL" SPACE mailbox *(SPACE identifier SPACE rights)

   deleteacl       ::= "DELETEACL" SPACE mailbox SPACE identifier

   getacl          ::= "GETACL" SPACE mailbox

   identifier      ::= astring

   listrights      ::= "LISTRIGHTS" SPACE mailbox SPACE identifier

   listrights_data ::= "LISTRIGHTS" SPACE mailbox SPACE identifier
                           SPACE rights *(SPACE rights)

   myrights        ::= "MYRIGHTS" SPACE mailbox

   myrights_data   ::= "MYRIGHTS" SPACE mailbox SPACE rights

   rights          ::= astring

   setacl          ::= "SETACL" SPACE mailbox SPACE identifier SPACE rights

8.   Security Considerations

   An implementation must make sure the ACL commands themselves do not
   give information about mailboxes with appropriately restricted ACL's.
   For example, a GETACL command on a mailbox for which the user has
   insufficient rights should not admit the mailbox exists, much less
   return the mailbox's ACL.
