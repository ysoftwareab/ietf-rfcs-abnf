1.  Introduction

   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is widely used in
   Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) to support the optical
   circuit set-up through the signalling between Core Nodes and Edge
   Nodes (reusing terminology from [RFC4208].  This extension addresses
   the use cases described by [RFC7698] Ch.3.3 and supports the
   information, needed in Spectrum Switched Optical Network (SSON), to
   signal a Media Channel and the associated carriers set request.  The
   new set of parameters is related to the Media Channel and the
   carrier(s) routed with it and keep the backward compatibility with
   the WSON signalling.  In particular this memo addresses the use cases
   where the SSON LSP (the Media Channel in RFC7698) use multiple

   carrier (OTSi) to carry the Payload.  The set of the carriers can be
   seen as single Logical circuit.  This memo can be considered as the
   extension of [RFC7792].

   Figure 1 shows how the multiple carrier are mapped into a Media
   Channel.  A set of parameters must be shared on the UNI to allow the
   core control plane to do the proper routing and Spectrum Assignment
   and decide the carrier position.

                        Figure 1: Multi carrier LSP

2.  Client interface parameters

   The Edge Node interface can have one or multiple carriers (OTSi).
   All the carrier have the same characteristics and are provisionable
   in terms of:

   Number of subcarriers:
      This parameter indicates the number of subcarriers (OTSi)
      available for the super-channel (OTSiG or OTSiA) in case the
      Transceiver can support multiple carrier circuits.  The OTSi is
      defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.959.1, section 3.2.4 [G.959.1].
      The OTSiG is currently being moved from ITU-T Recommendation G.709
      [G.709] to the new draft Recommendation G.807 (still work in
      progress) [G.807].  The OTSiG is an electrical signal that is

Internet-Draftdraft-ggalimbe-ccamp-flexigrid-carrier-label-December 2021


      carried by one or more OTSi's.  The relationship between the OTSiG
      and the OTSi's is described in ITU-T draft Recommendation G.807,
      section 10.2 [G.807].  This draft specifies the case where the
      each carrier (OTSi) is terminated on a physical port so the
      transceiver can have multiple ports.  In future editions also the
      case where multiple carriers are terminated on the same port will
      be supported (also known as Sliceable Transponders).

   Central frequency (see G.694.1 Table 1):
      This parameter indicates the Central frequency value that Ss and
      Rs will be set to work (in THz).  See the details in Section 6/
      G.694.1 or based on "n" value explanation and the following "k"
      values definition in case of multicarrier transceivers.

   Central frequency granularity:
      This parameter indicates the Central frequency granularity
      supported by the transceiver, this value is combined with k and n
      value to calculate the central frequency of the carrier or sub-
      carriers.

   Minimum channel spacing:
      This is the minimum nominal difference in frequency (in GHz)
      between two adjacent channels (or carriers) depending on the
      Transceiver characteristics and provisioning.

   Bit rate / Baud rate of Optical Tributary Signals (OTSi):
      Optical Tributary Signal bit (for NRZ signals) rate or Symbol (for
      Multiple bit per symbol) rate .

   FEC Coding:
      This parameter indicate what Forward Error Correction (FEC) code
      is used at Ss and Rs (R/W) (not mentioned in G.698.2).  .

   Wavelength Range (see G.694.1):  [ITU.G694.1]
      This parameter indicate minimum and maximum wavelength spectrum in
      a definite wavelength Band (L, C and S).  That is the transceiver
      tunability range

   Modulation format:
      This parameter indicates the list of supported Modulation Formats
      and the provisioned Modulation Format.

   Inter carrier skew:
      This parameter indicates, in case of multi-carrier LSP (OTSiG) the
      maximum skew between the sub-carriers OTSi) supported by the
      transceivers.

   Laser Output power:



Galimberti, et al.        Expires July 2, 2022                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draftdraft-ggalimbe-ccamp-flexigrid-carrier-label-December 2021


      This parameter provisions the Transceiver Output power, it can be
      either a setting and measured value.

   Receiver input power:
      This parameter provisions the Min and Max input power supported by
      the Transceiver, i.e. Receiver Sensitivity.

   The above parameters are related to the Edge Node Transceiver and are
   used by the Core Network control plane in order to calculate the
   optical feasibility and the spectrum allocation.  The parameters can
   be shared between the Client and the Network via LMP or provisioned
   to the Network by an EMS or an operator OSS.

3.  Use Cases

   The use cases are described in [RFC7698]

4.  Signalling Extensions

   The following sections specify the fields used in the RSVP-TE Path
   and Resv messages to address the requirements above.  The above
   parameters could be applied to [RFC4208] scenarios but they are valid
   also in case of non UNI scenarios.  The [RFC7699] parameters remain
   valid.

4.1.  New LSP Request Parameters

   When the E.N. wants to request to the C.N. a new circuit set-up, i.e.
   the control plane wants to signal in the SSON network the Optical
   Interface characteristics, the following parameters will be provided
   to the C.N.:

   Number of available subcarriers (c):
      This parameter is an integer and identifies the number of OTSi in
      an OTSiG.  In this version of the document, it maps to the number
      of Client ports connected to the Core ports available to support
      the requested circuit.

   Total bandwidth request:
      e.g. 200Gb, 400Gb, 1Tb - it is the bandwidth (payload) to be
      carried by the multiple carrier circuit (OTSiG).  In alternative
      the OTUCn can be used

   Policy (strict/loose):
      Strict/loose referred to B/W and subcarrier number.  This is to
      give some flexibility to the GMPLS in order to commit client
      request.

   Subcarrier bandwidth tunability:
      (optional) e.g. 34Ghz, 48GHz.

   The TLV define the resource constraints for the requested Media
   Channel.

   The format of the sub-object is as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

                     Figure 2: SSON LSP set-up request

   Carrier Number: number of carrier to be allocated for the requested
       channel (16-bit unsigned integer)
       If Carrier Number == 0 no constraint set on the number of
       carriers to be used

   Total Bandwidth: the requested total bandwidth to be supported by
       the Media Channel (32-bit IEEE float, bytes/s)
       If Total Bandwidth == 0: no bandwidth constraint is defined
       (B must be 0)

   S strict number of subcarrier
    - S = 0: the number of requested carriers is the maximum number
             that can be allocated (a lower value can be allocated if
             the requested bandwidth is satisfied)
    - S = 1: the number of requested carriers is strict (must be > 0)

   B Bandwidth constraints
    - B = 0: the value is the maximum requested bandwidth (a lower
             value can be allocated if resources are not available)
    - B = 1: the requested bandwidth is the minimum value to be
             allocated (a higher value can be allocated if requested
             by the physical constraints of the ports)

   Reserved: unused bit (for future use, should be 0)

   Note: bandwidth unit is defined in accordance to RFC 3471
      chap. 3.1.2 Bandwith Encoding specification.  Bandwidth higher
      than 40Gb/s values must be defined (e.g. 100Gb/s, 150Gb/s
      400Gb/s, etc.) or in alternative the OTUCn defined in
      ITU-T G.709.

   TLV Usage in RSVP-TE message:
   Path from head E.N.: requested traffic constraints, the Head C.N.
       must satisfy when reserving the optical resources and
       defining the carriers configuration
   The TLV can be omitted: no traffic constraints is defined
       (resources allocated by C.N. based on a local policy)

4.2.  Extension to LSP set-up specification

   Once the WDM comtrol plane (running in C.N.) has calculated the Media
   Channel path, the Spectrum Allocation, the Sub-carrier number and
   frequency, the modulation format, the FEC and the Transmit power, the
   path set-up confirmation MUST be sent back to the E.N. providing the
   values of the calculated parameters:

   Media Channel:
      (Grid, C.S., Identifier m and n). as indicated in RFC7699
      Section 4.1

   Modulation format:
      This parameter indicates the Modulation Formats to be set in the
      Transceivers.

   FEC Coding:
      This parameter indicate what Forward Error Correction (FEC) code
      must be used by the Transceivers (not mentioned in G.698).  .

   Baud rate of optical tributary signals:
      Symbol (for Multiple bit per symbol) rate.

   List of subcarriers:
      This parameter indicates the subcarriers to be used for the super-
      channel (OTSiG) in case the Transceiver can support multiple
      carrier Circuits.

   Carriers Central frequency granularity (J):
      This parameter indicates the Central frequency granularity
      supported by the transceiver, this value is combined with K and n
      value to calculate the central frequency on the carrier or sub-
      carriers.

   Carrier Central frequency (see G.694.1 Table 1) (k):

      Grid, Identifiers, central frequency and granularity.

   Laser Output power:
      This parameter provisions the Transceiver Output power, it can be
      either a setting and measured value.

   Circuit Path, RRO, etc:
      All these info are defined in [RFC4208].

   Path Error:
      e.g. no path exist, all the path error defined in [RFC4208].

4.2.1.  Common Signal Description TLV

   The TLV defines the carriers signal configuration.
   All carriers in a Media Channel MUST have the same configuration.

   It is aligned with TLV in 3.2.1 section in
      [I-D.draft-meuric-ccamp-tsvmode-signaling].

   The format of this sub-object (Type = TBA, Length = TBA) is
   as follows:

   Traffic Type
   - Modulation ID (Format) : is the modulation type:
         BPSK, DC DP BSPSK, QPSK, DP QPSK, 8QAM, 16QAM,
         32QAM, 64QAM, etc.
   - Bits/Symbol(BPS) this indicates the bit per symbol in case of
      hybrid modulation format. It is an off-set with values from 0
      to 127 to be applied to the specified Modulation Format and
      indicates the mix between the selected Modulation Format and its
      upper adjacent modulation format.
      (e.g. QPSK + 63 BPS indicates that there is a 50% MIX between
      QPSK and 8-QAM = 2.5 bits per symbol) If value = 0 the
      standard Modulation Format is applied.
   - FEC: the signal Forward Error Corrections type (16-bit
            unsigned integer), the defined values are:
            - Value 0 is reserved to be used if no value is defined
   - Min OSNR Threshold: An integer specifying the minimum accepted
        threshold for the Optical Signal-Noise Ratio in 0.1 nm.
   - Baud Rate: the signal symbol rate (IEEE 32-bit float,
              in bauds/s)
            - Value 0 is reserved to be used if no value is defined

   Notes:
   - The Path message from the E.C. can specify all or
     only a subset of the parameters (e.g. the Modulation and the
     baud rate as required but not the FEC) setting to 0 for the
     undefined parameters.
     When forwarding the Path message, the C.N. will set the
     undefined parameters based on the optical impairment calculation
     and the constraints given by the E.N.
   - Custom codes (values > 0x8000) interpretation is a local
     installation matter.

   TLV Usage in RSVP-TE messages:
   - Path from the head E.N.: used to force specific transponder
     configurations
   - Path from the tail C.N.: set selected configuration on head node
   - Resv from the head C.N.: set selected configuration on tail node

   Carrier setup:

   - Carrier Index field: sub-carrier (OTSi) index
         inside the OTSiG (corresponding to the media channel).
         Identifies the carrier
         position inside the Media Channel (16-bit unsigned integer)
         The Carrier Index is the logical circuit sub-lane
         position, a TLV for each value from 1 to the number of
         allocated carriers must be present.
   - J field:  granularity of the channel spacing, can be a
         multiple of 0.01GHz. - default value is 0.1GHz.
   - K field:  positive or negative integer (including 0) to multiply
         by J and identify the Carrier Position inside the
         Media Channel, offset from Media Channel Central frequency
   - sub-TLVs: additional information related to carriers if needed
         and the ports associated to the carrier.

     In summary Carrier Frequency = MC-C.F. (in THz) + K * J GHz.

4.3.  RSVP Protocol Extensions Considerations

   The additional information described in the draft, is related to the
   Media Channel supported traffic.  The parameters to be used by the
   egress transceivers are carried in Path messages.  In RSVP-TE
   signaling, hop-specific information is encoded within the ERO as hop
   attributes and WDM parameters are to be carried as sub-TLVs within
   the Type 4 TLV [RFC7689], in the Hop Attributes SubObject





Galimberti, et al.        Expires July 2, 2022                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draftdraft-ggalimbe-ccamp-flexigrid-carrier-label-December 2021


   Beside, some of the additional information defined is local to the
   head/tail UNI link (e.g. the carrier/port association), while the
   traffic spec info should be valid end-to-end.

   There can be different methods to model and signal the carriers as
   described in draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang.  The
   Media Channel, Network Media Channel and lables are well modelled by
   the RFC7698, RFC7699 and RFC7792 reflecting the ITU-T Recommendations
   G.694.1 and G.698.2.

   Some work is in progress in ITU-T SG15/Q12 to define Network Media
   Channel (group) that is capable of accommodating the optical
   tributary signals (OTSi) belonging to optical tributary signal group
   (OTSiG) (see new ITU-T Draft Recommendation G.807).

   Other the encoding proposal reported in this draft, there are at
   least two other methods to describe the parameters.  An option is to
   describe the OTSi carrier frequency relative to the anchor frequency
   193.1THz based on a well-defined granularity (e.g.  OTSi carrier
   frequency = 193100 (GHz) + K * granularity (GHz) where K is a signed
   integer value).  A second option is to explicitly describe the OTSi
   carrier frequency and the OTSi signal width in GHz with a certain
   accuracy.

   The second option which is independent of the n, m values already
   defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.694.1.  The OTSi carrier frequency
   is described in GHz with 3 fractional digits (decimal 64 fraction
   digits 3).  The OTSi signal width is described in GHz with 3
   fractional digits (decimal 64 fraction digits 3) and includes the
   signal roll off as well as some guard band.

   The accuracy of 0.001 GHz does not impose a requirement on the
   optical transceiver components (optical transmitter) in terms of
   carrier frequency tunability precision.  Today's components typically
   provide a tunability precision in the range of 1..1.5GHz (carrier
   frequency offset compared to the configured nominal carrier
   frequency).
   Future components may provide a better precision as technology
   evolves.  If needed, a controller may retrieve the transceiver
   properties in terms of carrier frequency tunability precision in
   order to be capable of properly configuring the underlying
   transceiver.

   NOTE FROM THE EDITORS: As this description is arbitrarily proposed by
   the authors to cover a lack of information in IETF and ITU-T, a
   liaison request to ITU-T is needed.  The authors are willing to
   contribute to Liaison editing and to consider any feedback and
   proposal from ITU-T.

5.  Security Considerations

   RSVP-TE message security is described in [RFC5920].  IPsec and HMAC-
   MD5 authentication are common examples of existing mechanisms.  This
   document only defines new UNI objects that are carried in existing
   UNI messages, thus it does not introduce new security considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

      The IANA is requested to create, within the "GMPLS Signaling
      Parameters" registry, two new sub-registries named "WDM
      Modulation Formats" and "WDM FEC Types".

      For both of them:

      o  the value 0 means "Pending selection",

      o  the range 1-65503 follows the Expert Review policy for
         registration,

      o  the range 65504-65535 is for experimental use.

      The "WDM Modulation Format" sub-registry is initialized as
      follows:

                       +-------------+---------------------+
                       | Value       |  Modulation Format  |
                       +-------------+---------------------+
                       | 0           | Pending selection   |
                       | 1           | DPSK                |
                       | 2           | QPSK                |
                       | 3           | 8-QAM               |

                       | 6           | 64-QAM              |
                       | 7-63999     | Unallocated         |
                       | 64000-65535 | Vendor specific use |
                       +-------------+---------------------+

      The "WDM FEC Types" sub-registry is initialized as follows:

                       +-------------+---------------------+
                       | Value       | FEC Types           |
                       +-------------+---------------------+
                       | 0           | Pending selection   |
                       | 1           | Reed Solomon FEC    |
                       | 2           | Staircase FEC       |
                       | 3           | O-FEC.              |
                       | 4-63999     | Unallocated         |
                       | 64000-65535 | Vendor specific use |
