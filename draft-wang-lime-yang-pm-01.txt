                       draft-wang-lime-yang-pm-01

Abstract

   This document presents a YANG Data model for OAM Performance
   management support.  The YANG Model presented in this document
   extends the Generic YANG Data Model for OAM with Loss Measurement and
   Delay measurement to support OAM Performance management.

   In this document we extend the YANG model defined in [GENYANGGOAM]
   with Loss Measurement and Delay measurement to support OAM
   Performance management.  Details are provided in section 4 below.

3.  YANG Extension

   MEP Addressing is defined in Generic YANG OAM model[GENYANGGOAM].  In
   this draft we augment MEP Configuration with Performance Management
   configuration and statistics for Delay Measurement and Performance
   Measurement.  In addtion, we define new rpcs for performance
   measurement.

3.1.  MEP Configuration Extension

3.1.1.  Loss Measurement Configuration

   This section describes a set of data definitions for Loss Measurement
   configuration.  This set of data defintions augment the MEP
   configuration defined in the Generic YANG OAM model with parameters
   related to Loss Measurement and define the role of MEP and
   measurement method of the loss measurement.

3.3.  rpc definitions

   The rpc model facilitates issuing commands to a NETCONF server (in
   this case to the device that needs to execute the OAM command) and
   obtaining a response.

   Configuration data in the Section 3.2 and Section 3.1.1 provides
   input extension for Delay and Loss measurement RPCs.

3.3.1.  create-loss-measurement

   RPC allows scheduling of one-way or two-way on-demand or proactive
   performance monitoring loss measurement session.

3.3.2.  abort-loss-measurement

   RPC allow aborting of currently running or scheduled loss measurement
   session.

3.3.3.  create-delay-measurement

   RPC allow scheduling of one-way or two-way on-demand or proactive
   performance monitoring delay measurement session.

3.3.4.  abort-delay-measurement

   RPC allow aborting of currently running or scheduled delay
   measurement session.

4.  PM data hierarchy

   The complete data hierarchy related to the OAM PM YANG is presented
   below.  The following notations are used within the tree and carry
   the meaning as noted below.

   Each node is printed as:
