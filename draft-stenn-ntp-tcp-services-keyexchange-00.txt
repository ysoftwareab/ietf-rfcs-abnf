              draft-stenn-ntp-tcp-services-keyexchange-00

Abstract

   This document describes the Key Exchange commands that are included
   in the NTP TCP Services protocol, which is used to implement the
   Secure Network Time protocol.

1.  Introduction

   The NTP Secure Network Time proposal relies on the secure pre-
   exchange of information to create and validate NTP MACs,

   This secure pre-exchange is performed using NTP TCP Services.

   This document describes that protocol.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  NTP TCP Services: Key Exchange

   To perform the key exchange for Secure Network Time, one side opens a
   TCP connection to the other host, performs any initial handshake, and
   SHOULD issue a STARTTLS directive to create a secure channel between
   the two processes.

   Once that has been done, ...

   RFC 5705 [RFC5705]

   RFC 7301 [RFC7301]

   [Show how this works for Client/Server mode]

   [Show how this works for symmetric mode]

   [Show how this work for manycast/multicast]

   [Show how this would work for broadcast mode where the client can
   open a connection to the server]
