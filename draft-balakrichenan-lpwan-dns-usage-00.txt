Abstract

   DNS protocol and the database are used extensively in the Internet.
   Usage of DNS in the constrained devices or network is still nascent.
   This document describes how DNS could be used in a constrained
   scenario such as the LPWAN.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8376] ] states that the goal of the LPWAN WG is to, where
   necessary, adapt IETF-defined protocols, addressing schemes, and
   naming conventions to LPWAN.

   Domain names (i.e. the Internet naming convention) in association
   with the DNS (i.e. the Internet naming authority and Server) are
   introduced in the Internet not only because that humans remember
   names better than numbers but also for operational facilities.

   This is a preliminary document elaborating on how DNS could be used
   in constrained scenarios such as LPWAN.  The initial ideas that have
   been presented will be elaborated.

2.  Names as Identifiers

   Like in all networks, LPWAN has two identifier types - i.e. the
   unique identifier representing the source and the unique identifier
   representing the destination, within the scope of that network.

   For example, In LoRaWAN, the source is represented by the DevEUI
   (i.e. the device address) and the destination corresponding to the
   source is represented by the JoinEUI (i.e. the Join Server address)
   and the AppEUI (i.e. the Application server address).  Naturally, the
   source and the destination information are sent as part of the packet
   header.  These different addresses are constructed using the IEEE-
   EUI-64 format.

   As in the Internet, there are multiple advantages in using domain
   names instead of IEEE defined 64 bit identifiers for representing
   either the source or the destination or both.  As per the LoRa
   specifications, the JoinEUI is converted to a domain name to identify

   the Join Server IP address in the case of OTAA (Over the Air
   Activation) or roaming.

   This section describes how identifiers in the LPWAN could be
   configurable to a domain name.  The device sends the source and
   destination information, represented as domain name in the packet
   header and it is up to the gateway to resolve the IP address
   corresponding to the domain name and cache this information.  Caching
   will enable that the future connections need to re-do the DNS look up
   until the cache is expired.

3.  Retrieving the context information via DNS

   Draft [ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc-18] defines a compression
   technique for LPWAN based on a static context that is known by both
   the device as well as the Network Gateway.  The Compression/
   Decompression (C/D) process is as follows: The device compresses the
   packet header using SCHC C/D.  The resulting SCHC packet is sent to a
   LPWAN Radio Gateway, which forwards it to a Network Gateway.  At the
   Network Gateway end, the packet is decompressed using SCHC C/D.
   After decompression, the packet is sent over the Internet to one or
   several LPWAN application servers.

   The SCHC C/D must be present on both sides i.e. at the device and as
   well as at the Network Gateway.  At both ends the same set of rules
   (which is termed as "Context") is shared.  The Context is not
   transmitted over the air.  Only the Rule ID (an identifier which
   identifies a rule that is already stored at both ends) is sent over
   the air.

   The manner the contexts are obtained both at the device and as well
   as the Network Gateway is not normalized.  There are different
   suggestion such as either the contexts could be pre-provisioned,
   learned by a provisioning protocol or by an out of band mechanism.

   The context could be defined by a data model
   [I-D.toutain-lpwan-yang-static-context-hc].  This section presents
   how to securely retrieve "Context" at both ends using DNS.
