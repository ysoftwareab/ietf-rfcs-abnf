     Abstract 
         
        This document defines an experimental portion of the Management 
        Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in 
        Internet Protocol Version 6 internets.  Specifically, this document is 
        the MIB module that defines managed objects for implementations of the 
        Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol [MLD].

       Terminology 
         
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119]. 
         
      
     2. 
       The SNMP Management Framework 
         
        The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
        components: 
         
            o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571]. 
         
            o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
              purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of 
              Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 
              16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215

              [RFC1215]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 
              58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580[RFC2580]. 
      
            o Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
              first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
              described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the 
              SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track 
              protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] 
              and RFC 1906 [RFC1906]. The third version of the message protocol 
              is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 
              [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574]. 
         
            o Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
              first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
              described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol 
              operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
              [RFC1905]. 
      
            o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573[RFC2573] 
              and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 
              [RFC2575]. 
      
        A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework 
        can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
        the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined 
        using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
         
        This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB 
        conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
        translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
        equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
        translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine-readable 
        information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
        SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine-
        readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the 
        MIB.

        This MIB module contains two tables: 
         
          1. 
             The MLD Interface Table, which contains one row for each interface 
             on which MLD is enabled. 
         
          2. 
             The MLD Cache Table which contains one row for each IPv6 Multicast 
             group for which there are members on a particular interface. 
         
        Both tables are intended to be implemented by hosts and routers.  Some 
        objects in each table apply to routers only.

       Security Considerations 
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a 
        MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be 
        considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The 
        support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper 
        protection can have a negative effect on network operations. 
         
        There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain 
        sensitive information. These are: 
         
          o  mldCacheSelf 
          o  mldCacheLastReporter 
         
         
        It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and 
        possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them 
        over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features 
        for such a secure environment. 
         
        SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
        itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no 
        control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 

       
     Haberman, Worzella                                                   9 
         
      

     Internet Draft               MIB for MLD                 November 1999 
         
         
        It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features 
        as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
        based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-based Access 
        Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] are recommended. 
         
        It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity 
        giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 
        Certain management information defined in this MIB MAY be considered 
        sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of 
        received SNMP requests and controlled access to management information 
        SHOULD be employed in such environments.  The method for this 
        authentication is a function of the SNMP Administrative Framework, and 
        has not been expanded by this MIB. 
         
        Several objects in this MIB allow write access or provide for row 
        creation.  Allowing this support in a non-secure environment can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  It is RECOMMENDED that 
        implementers seriously consider whether set operations or row creation 
        be allowed without providing, at a minimum, authentication of request 
        origin.  It is RECOMMENDED that without such support that objects be 
        implemented as read-only.
