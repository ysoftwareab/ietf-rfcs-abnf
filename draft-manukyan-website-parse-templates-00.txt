Internet-Draft            Website Parse Templates             April 2008



1. Introduction

   Website Parse Template is a specification for website structure and
   content description for web crawlers. It is an effective way to
   provide web crawlers with proper web page templates to parse website
   content more accurately co-ordinating the same object attributes
   used in different pages of the same website. Web page structure and
   content description represented as Website Parse Template is to be
   referred to as Website Parse Template file (with ".icdl" extension).

   Website Parse Template is compatible with existing Semantic Web[3]
   concepts defined by World Wide Web Consortium[4] (Resource
   Description Framework - RDF[1] and Web Ontology Language - OWL[5])
   and Universal Networking Language - UNL[6] specifications.


2. Website Parse Template Structure

   Website Parse Template consists of following sections:

   Ontology - enumeration and definition of all concepts used in certain
              web site;
   Templates- web site's structural elements associations with defined
              concepts;
   URLs     - URLs or URL patterns that are comply with described
              templates.


   Single Website Parse Template is referred to the same host, while
   single host may have several Website Parse Templates describing its
   structured content. The host should be specified at the beginning of
   corresponding Website Parse Template file:    
   
   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
   
   <icdl host="http://hostname.com"> 
   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
   </icdl>
   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

2.1. Ontology

   Ontology section defines all concepts used in website. Defined
   concepts must be enclosed within <ontology> </ontology> tags. It is
   required to specify the ontology name and indicate language that is
   used to describe the concepts.

   E.g. the concept "artist", which is inherited from "person" and may
   have attributes "name", "image", "bio", "track", "video", etc., has
   the following representation:
   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

   <ontology name="general" language="icdl:ontology">  
      <concept name="artist">
          <inherit concept="person"></inherit>
          <has object="name"></has>
          <has object="album"></has>
          <has object="track"></has>
          <has object="image"></has>
          <has object="bio"></has>
          <has object="video"></has>
          <has object="id/> 
          <has object="fullname"/>
      </concept>
   </ontology>
   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

   The ontology name can be any comprehensive string, but for the 
   language it is necessary to indicate supported language type, e.g. 
   "icdl:ontology", "owl", "unl:uws". "inherit" tag shows inheritance
   relation between two concepts, "has" tag shows attributable
   relations. Either of defined concepts has default attribute - object
   identifier (id) to be used by web crawlers to co-ordinate the same
   object's attributes used in different pages of the same website.

   Website Parse Template foresees following predefined concepts that
   are general for all kind of websites:

   "Menu" - navigation bar/menu
   "Logo" - design element/logo
   "Content" - element that contains main textual content of the page
   "Advertisement" - advertisement/banner
   "External Link" - element that contains external links

2.2. Template

   The template section describes website's HTML structure and content
   using concepts defined in ontology section. The template should be 
   enclosed within <template> </template> tags. 

   E.g. the artist web page may have certain structure with following 
   simple website template:
  
   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

   <template name="Artist web page" language="icdl:template">
     <html_tag tagid="menu" content="Menu"/>
     <html_tag xpath="/html/body/div/div" content="Logo"/>
     <html_tag xpath="/html/body/div/table/tr" content="artist.name"/>
     <html_tag tagid="image" content="artist.image"/>
     <html_tag tagid="bio" content="artist.bio" reference="Artist bio"/>
     <container container_xpath="/html/body/div/table/tr/td"> 
       <repeatable_block block_xpath="/html/body/div/table/tr/td[2]">
         <html_tag tagid="track_block" content="artist.track"/>
       </repeatable_block>
     </container>
   </template>
   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
   
   The template name can be any comprehensive string, but for the 
   language it is necessary to indicate supported language type, e.g. 
   "icdl:template", "rdf", "unl:expression". 
 
   HTML structure elements represented in template section are indicated
   by "xpaths"[2] or "tag IDs". The web page may contain structured 
   repeatable content ("repeatable block") included in one main
   structural element ("container"). 

   If specified structural element is already described by another
   template the "reference" tag can be used to point to that "template
   block" as follows:

   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

   <html_tag tagid="bio" content="artist.bio" reference="Artist bio"/>
   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

   It makes possible to create hierarchic relations between the same 
   website templates so that web crawlers can use specified reference(s)
   to identify the same object in different pages of a given web site.

2.3. URLs 

   This section defines the URLs or URL patterns that are corresponding 
   to described website parse templates. Listed URLs/URL patterns should
   be enclosed within <urls> </urls> tags as follows:

   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
   
   <urls name="Artist page URLs" template="Artist page">
      <url url="http://hostname.com/..."/>
      <url url="http://hostname.com/...[pattern]"/>
      <url url="http://hostname.com/(artist.name[A-Z,a-z,-,0-9]*).htm"/>
      <url url="http://hostname.com/a.cgi?id=(artist.id[0-9]*).htm"/>
   </urls>
   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

   "template" shows which one of the described website templates 
   corresponds to listed URLs/URL patterns. Regular Expressions[7] are
   used for URL patterns descriptions. The concepts necessary for URL
   pattern definition (such as "name" and "id") are to be defined 
   previously in ontology section.



3. Security Considerations

   The syntax rules for Website Parse Templates creation that is
   documented here pose no direct risk to computers and networks. 
   However, people can use these rules to build Website Parse Templates
   that are inaccurate or even deliberately misleading, which reflects
   incorrect parsing of website structured content. 

   Systems that are based on Website Parse Templates need to consider
   issues related to its accuracy and validity as part of their design
   and implementation, and users of such systems need to consider the
   design and implementation assumptions.  



4. IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
