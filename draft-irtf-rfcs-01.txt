2.  Introduction

   This document specifies a review and publication process for the
   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) [RFC2014].  Most documents
   undergoing this process will come from IRTF Research Groups and the
   objective is that they are published as Informational or Experimental
   RFCs by the RFC Editor.

   Historically, drafts from IRTF Research Group have been treated like
   independent submissions by the RFC Editor.  Roughly, the process
   consisted of the following steps:

   o  The document author submits an Internet Draft to the RFC Editor as
      an independent submission.

   o  The RFC Editor performs independent submission review (ISR) for
      editorial acceptability and may request the authors revise the
      document before publishing.

   o  The IESG performs a review (to avoid collisions with standards
      process work) and inserts a note (see [RFC3932]).

   o  Independent submissions experienced lower priority processing as
      they move through the RFC Editor's queue.

   This document defines a new review and publication process for an
   IRTF Document Stream.  (Document streams are described in Section 5
   of [I-D.iab-rfc-editor].)  While a Research Group or RG member may
   continue to choose to publish RFCs through the independent submission
   process, an IRTF document stream brings certain advantages.  First,
   IRSG review is conducted by the Internet Research Steering Group,
   which includes researchers who understand the IRTF and the goals and
   operations of the member Research Groups.  This may not be true for
   the RFC Editorial Board, who normally review independent submissions.
   Second, by avoiding RFC Editorial Board review, IRTF RFCs will spend
   less time with the RFC Editor.  Finally, the proposed IESG note for
   IRTF RFCs (see Appendix A) was developed by the IRSG to be more
   applicable to RG publications than the note normally prepended to
   independent submissions (see RFC3932).  The RFC3932 language was
   developed to apply to a wide range of document types including, for
   example, vendor-developed protocols and the warnings have been
   characterized as strong and conservative.  Note, however, that the
   IESG makes the final choice of text and this document cannot make
   guarantees.  Nevertheless, the text recommended in this document is
   intended to apply to most IRTF documents.

   The IRTF RFC process may be summarized as:

Internet-Draft                  IRTF RFCs                      June 2007


   o  The Research Group performs a thorough technical and editorial
      review of the document and agrees it should be published.

   o  The Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG) conducts an editorial
      review

   o  The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) reviews the
      document to assure that there are no conflicts with current or
      expected standardization activities

   o  The document is submitted to the RFC Editor for publication and
      treated with the same processing priority as, for example, IAB-
      stream documents

   This draft has been updated based on about nine months of experience
   and processing of four documents.  The IRTF plans to continue the
   trial of this process for several more documents and may again revise
   this process.

3.  Document Shepherds

   Documents must have a shepherd.  This is a relatively new concept
   initially developed in the IETF to ensure that issues raised in the
   review and publication process are responded to in a timely manner.
   The IETF shepherding process is described in
   [I-D.ietf-proto-wgchair-doc-shepherding] and has been adapted to the
   IRTF publication process.

   Shepherd responsibilities are noted for each phase of the publication
   process in subsequent sections.  Some general things to note:

   o  Shepherds should normally be an RG chair since they know the IRSG
      members, are familiar with the technical content, and know the
      document history.  However, the RG chair should generally not be a
      shepherd if they are an author of the document, but may assume the
      responsibility if the IRTF chair so permits (e.g., when another
      shepherd is not available within a reasonable time period).  If
      the chair can not be the document shepherd, they should select
      someone from the Research Group for this role since it is
      important that they are able to interact with the RG and assess
      the group's response to comments.

   o  Shepherds are responsible to track and facilitate document
      progression through RFC publication.  This includes finding IRSG
      reviewers, facilitating resolution of review comments, entering
      information into the tracker(s), keeping track of review
      schedules, and prodding token holders to act expeditiously.

   o  Shepherds should summarize substantive review comments and their
      resolution.

   o  Shepherds should be copied on all correspondence regarding a
      document.  For example, if the IESG has questions during their
      review, the shepherd should be included in the exchange.  This can
      be helpful should the RG take a position different than the author
      on suggested changes.

4.  Document Tracker

   As of this writing the IRSG is using its own public document tracker
   [TRAC].  This tracker is intended to collect the shepherd and
   reviewer identities, reviewer comments, and state transitions as the
   document progresses.  It is the responsibility of the shepherd to
   maintain the tracker.

   It is expected that, in the future, the IRTF will use the IETF's I-D
   Tracker [IDTRAC] to collect and manage this information.
   Modifications are planned for the I-D Tracker to accommodate the IRTF
   publication process.  When the I-D Tracker can support the process
   described below, the IRSG tracker will no longer be used.

   Information to be captured in the tracker:

   o  URL to the draft (updated if the draft is revised)

   o  Document shepherd name and contact information

   o  Type of RFC: Informational or Experimental

   o  Desired IESG Note (select from Appendix A)

   o  IRSG members performing editorial review (see Section 5.2)

   o  Scheduled date for IRSG poll

   o  IRSG poll results

   o  Pointers to RG reviews

   o  IRSG Review comments and resolutions (or pointers)

5.  Process Description

   The following sections describe the steps for IRTF-track document
   review and publication process.  There are fundamentally two steps:
   IRSG review and IESG review.  The document shepherd is responsible
   for making sure reviews are responded to and documented and that the
   process moves along.

5.1.  Research Group Preparation

   If an IRTF Research Group desires to publish a document as an IRTF
   RFC, the process in this document must be followed.  First, the RG
   must review the document for editorial and technical quality.

   Here are some content guidelines to be adhered to:

   o  There must be a statement in the abstract identifying it as the
      product of the RG

   o  There must be a paragraph near the beginning (for example, in the
      introduction) describing the level of support for publication.
      Example text might read: "this document represents the consensus
      of the FOOBAR RG" or "the views in this document were considered
      controversial by the FOOBAR RG but the RG reached a consensus that
      the document should still be published".

   o  The breadth of review the document has received must also be
      noted.  For example, was this document read by all the active
      contributors, only three people, or folks who are not "in" the RG
      but are expert in the area?

   o  It must also be very clear throughout the document that it is not
      an IETF product and is not a standard.

   o  If an experimental protocol is described, appropriate usage
      caveats must be present.

   o  If the protocol has been considered in an IETF working group in
      the past, this must be noted in the introduction as well.

   o  There should be citations and references to relevant research
      publications.

   The shepherd should be selected at this time as discussed in
   Section 3.  Now the document may be submitted to the IRSG for review.

5.2.  IRSG Review

   The IRSG functions similar to an editorial review board.  It is the
   IRSG's responsibility to ensure high technical and editorial quality.

5.2.1.  Initial steps

   The RG chair brings the document to the IRSG for publication by
   sending an email message to the IRSG requesting review and including
   a pointer to the draft.  The RG should be copied on the mail message
   requesting IRSG review.  If the RG chair is not going to be the
   document shepherd, that person should be identified at this time.

   The shepherd should do several things at this time:

   1.  Create an entry in the tracker for the document, entering all of
       the items listed in Section 4 that are available and setting the
       document state to "IRSG Review".

   2.  Send an email to the IRSG mailing list with pointers to the new
       tracker entries (this may be automated)

   3.  Find two members of the IRSG to perform a thorough review of the
       document.  This is to ensure at least two thorough reviews are
       performed.  (Use of a tool for round-robin assignment of reviews
       is under consideration.)

   4.  Open the poll, scheduled to close four weeks later.

5.2.2.  Reviews

   The purpose of the IRSG review is to ensure consistent editorial and
   technical quality for IRTF publications.  IRSG review is not a deep
   technical review.  (This should take place within the RG.)  At least
   one IRSG member other than the chair of the RG bringing the work
   forth must review the document and the RG's editorial process.

   IRSG reviewers should look for clear, cogent, and consistent writing.
   An important aspect of the review is to gain a critical reading from
   reviewers who are not subject matter experts and, in the process,
   assure the document will be accessible to those beyond the authoring
   research group.  Also, reviewers should assess whether sufficient
   editorial and technical review has been conducted and the
   requirements of this process document, such as those described in
   Section 5.1 have been met.  Finally, reviewers should check that
   appropriate citations to related research literature have been made.

   Reviews should be written to be public.  Review comments should be

Internet-Draft                  IRTF RFCs                      June 2007


   sent to the IRSG and RG mailing lists and entered into the tracker.
   All IRSG review comments must be addressed.  However, the RG need not
   accept every comment.  It is the responsibility of the shepherd to
   understand the comments and ensure that the RG considers them
   including adequate dialog between the reviewer and the author and/or
   RG.  Reviews and their resolution should be entered into the tracker
   by the document shepherd.

5.2.3.  IRSG Poll

   A (firm) four-week IRSG review period follows after which a poll is
   taken.  Votes can be:

   o  'Ready to publish' -- requires a thorough read and reasonably
      detailed review

   o  'Not ready to publish' -- requires a thorough read, reasonably
      detailed review, and actionable comments.

   o  'No objection' -- I don't object if this document goes forward;
      I've read the document (perhaps quickly); I have some small
      comments which are not show stoppers; I don't have great expertise
      in the area.

   o  'Request more time to review' -- a commitment to provide a
      thorough review in a specified period of time.

   At least two other IRSG members (besides the one sponsoring the
   document) need to vote 'ready to publish' for the document to move
   forward.  Any vote of 'not ready to publish' will hold a document's
   progress until the comments are addressed.  The IRTF chair may choose
   to override 'not ready to publish' holds that, in the opinion of the
   chair, have received an adequate response.  The IRTF chair will
   record the poll results in the tracker.

5.2.4.  Followup

   When an ID has been published reflecting the resolution of all
   comments, the shepherd sends an email to the IRTF Chair (cc'ing the
   IRSG and the RG) summarizing the IRSG review comments and their
   resolution and including pointers to the tracker entries, detailed
   reviews, and discussion.  The note should also contain the preferred
   IESG note (see Appendix A).

   IRSG Review is concluded at this time.  The tracker should be updated
   to reflect moving to new state, IESG Review.

Internet-Draft                  IRTF RFCs                      June 2007


5.3.  IESG Review

   The IRTF Chair will then send an email message to IESG
   (iesg@ietf.org) and the secretariat (iesg-secretariat@ietf.org)
   requesting a review and including the preferred IESG note.  The scope
   of this review is confined to that described in [RFC2026], section
   4.2.3, for non-IETF documents, specifically it is "[t]o ensure that
   the non-standards track Experimental and Informational designations
   are not misused to circumvent the Internet Standards Process."

   The IESG (via the IETF Secretariat) is expected to provide the IRTF
   chair with a response, normally within four weeks, as to whether
   publication of the draft is perceived to be at odds with the Internet
   Standards Process.  The IESG may have other comments in the
   datatracker which the RG may use to revise the document.

   The IESG may conclude that draft conflicts with the IETF process and
   recommend against publication (i.e,.  DNP or Do-Not-Publish).  Should
   this occur, the RG may choose to revise the document based on the
   comments accompanying this recommendation and pass a revised version
   to the IESG.  If the RG and IESG cannot come to agreement publishing
   the document, the RG chair may ask the IRTF Chair to raise the matter
   with the IAB, which will act as final arbiter on whether the document
   is submitted to the RFC Editor (along with the commentary and DNP
   recommendation from the IESG, to inform the RFC Editor in its
   publishing decision).

   The shepherd now sends a request for publication including pointers
   to the reviews in the tracker to the IRTF Chair, cc'ing the RG and
   IRSG.  The tracker should be updated at this time to reflect the new
   state, "Doc approved, awaiting submission to RFC Editor."

5.4.  RFC Editor Handling

   The IRTF Chair will forward the request for publication email to the
   RFC Editor, placing the document in the RFC Editor's publication
   queue.  The tracker should be updated to reflect the state of "RFC
   Editor publication queue."

   The document enters the RFC Editor queue at the same priority as
   IETF- and IAB-track (non-standards) documents.  The document shepherd
   is responsible for ensuring that the document authors are responsive
   to the RFC Editor and that the RFC editing process goes smoothly.
   The AUTH48 review stage of RFC publication is an area where the
   shepherd may be of particular assistance, ensuring a) authors respond
   promptly in reviewing about-to-be-published RFCs and b) authors don't
   inject changes into the document at the last minute which would not
   be supported by the research group or other reviewers.

Internet-Draft                  IRTF RFCs                      June 2007


Appendix A.  IESG Notes

   After the review an IESG note is typically added.  While the IESG may
   request the addition of any note they choose, the following notes are
   suggested for IRTF RFCs.[[anchor11: Note that the proposed notes
   below generated significant discussion with the IESG.  The IAB plans
   to work with the IESG, IRSG, and larger community on determining an
   acceptable labeling for non-IETF document streams.  The outcome of
   that discussion may result in changes to this text.]]

   For documents that represent the consensus of an IRTF Research Group:
       "This document is not an IETF Internet Standard.  It represents
        the consensus of the XXX Research Group of the Internet Research
        Task Force.  It may be considered for standardization by the
        IETF in the future."

   For documents that are not consensus documents but that the Research
   Group wishes to see published:
         "This document in not an IETF Internet Standard.  It represents
          the individual opinion(s) of one or more members of the XXX
          Research Group of the Internet Research Task Force.  It may be
          considered for standardization by the IETF or adoption as a
          IRTF Research Group consensus document in the future."
