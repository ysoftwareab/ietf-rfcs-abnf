  Abstract

  This memo defines a set of DNS (Domain Name System) exten-
  sions that have been created for the Internet MIB. When used
  in conjunction with the Structure of Management Information (RFC
  1155), the Management Information Base for Network Management
  of TCP/IP-based internets (RFC 1213) and the Simple Network
  Management Protocol (RFC 1157), it will be possible to provide

                      Internet Draft - DNS MIB - September 2, 1992



  1  Introduction

  With the adoption of The Simple Network Management Protocol (RFC
  1157), the Management Information Base for network management of
  TCP/IP-based internets (RFC 1213), and the Structure of Manage-
  ment Information (RFC 1155) by the Internet, and a large number
  of vendor implementations of these standards in commercially
  available products, it became possible to provide a higher level
  of effective network management in TCP/IP-based internets than
  previously available. With the growth in the use of these stan-
  dards, it has become possible to consider the management of
  other elements of the infrastructure beyond the basic TCP/IP
  protocols. A key element of the TCP/IP infrastructure is the
  DNS.

  Up to this point there has been no mechanism to integrate the
  management of the DNS with SNMP-based managers. This memo pro-
  vides the mechanisms by which IP-based management stations can
  effectively manage DNS client and server software in an inte-
  grated fashion through the use of the standard Internet SMI, MIB
  and Simple Network Management Protocol.

  New DNS MIB objects have been defined to be used in conjunction
  with the Internet MIB to allow access and control of the DNS via
  SNMP by the Internet community.


  2  Selected Objects

  The objects included in this memo have been created from infor-
  mation contained in the relevant DNS related RFCs which include:
  Domain Administrators Guide (RFC 1032), Domain Administrators
  Operations Guide (RFC 1033) Domain Names - Concepts and Facili-
  ties (RFC 1034), Domain Names - Implementation and Specification
  (RFC 1035), and Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application
  and Support (RFC 1123). In addition, objects have been created



             Document Expiration Date - March 7, 1993 - Saperia  1

 


   Internet Draft - DNS MIB - September 2, 1992



  based on expected operational need and from the example of ex-
  isting DNS specific tools. These objects have be ordered into
  groups as follows:


  o  General Configuration Group

  o  Resolver Configuration Group

  o  Server Configuration Group

  o  Resolver Counter Group

  o  Server Counter Group

  o  Records Group

  o  Resolver Cache Group

  o  Resolver Negative Cache Group

  o  Resolver Statistics Group

  o  Server Management Group

  Many of the objects defined in this memo have been created from
  information contained in existing configuration files used by
  many DNS implementations. This information has been converted
  into a standard form using the Internet Standard SMI defined in
  RFC 1155.

  3  Objects

  The objects in this memo are described using the standard Inter-
  net SMI and BER of RFC 1155. Each object description includes
  the objects name, its syntax and encoding. Just as with objects
  supported in the MIB (RFC 1156), an object name is identified
  with an object identifier which has been administratively as-
  signed. This identifies an Object Type. When an object type
  is combined with a specific instance - the particular object
  is uniquely identified. Use of Object Descriptors in this memo
  is consistent with that of RFC 1156 - meaning that they are

                      Internet Draft - DNS MIB - September 2, 1992



  text strings meant to be read by humans. The descriptors have
  been created from a variety of sources. For the most part, the
  descriptions are influenced by by the DNS related RFCs noted
  above. For example, the descriptors for counters used for the
  various types of queries of DNS records are influenced by the
  definitions used for the various record types found in Domain
  Names - Implementation and Specification RFC 1035.


  3.1  Format of Definitions

  An object in this memo is specified by five fields of informa-
  tion: Object, Syntax, Description, Access, and Status.

  The OBJECT is a textual name (OBJECT DESCRIPTOR) for that ob-
  ject type combined with an administratively obtained OBJECT
  IDENTIFIER.

  SYNTAX : For each object type, its abstract syntax is presented
  using the ASN.1 specified in RFC 1155.

  DESCRIPTION: A general description of the object type.

  ACCESS : The standard access keywords supported in RFC 1156 are
  used. The keywords used in this MIB are: read-only, read-write,
  and, not-accessible.

  STATUS : The status field is used to describe with a single
  keyword whether the object type is mandatory or optional. Status
  keywords of obsolete and deprecated are not used in this memo
  since this is the first version of the DNS MIB.

  3.2  Textual Conventions

  Several datatypes have been introduced as a textual conven-
  tions in this DNS MIB document. These additions will facilitate
  the common understanding of information used by the DNS. No
  changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to support these
  conventions which are described in 4.0 (Object Definitions).

       -- object which can be set to a value of 2 to delete that
       -- row of the table.  If a read operation is performed on this

       -- Server Counter Group

       -- The implementation of the Server Counter Group is mandatory for
       -- all systems which offer either recursive or non recursive server
       -- software functions.

       -- Several of the objects in this group make distinctions between
       -- queries which originate with the local host, within the same
       -- zone as the local host or come from outside the zone of the
       -- server.  The purpose of these distinctions is to allow for
       -- implementations to group queries and responses on this basis.
       -- One way in which servers may make these distinctions is by
       -- looking at the source IP address of the DNS query.  If the
       -- source of the query is 'your own' then the query should be
       -- counted as 'yourself' - local host.  If the source of the query
       -- matches an 'access list' - the the query came from a friend,
       -- that is; within the local zone.  What constitutes an 'access
       -- list' is implementation dependent and could be as simple as all
       -- hosts on the same IP network as the DNS server are classed as in
       -- the local zone and are 'friends'.  In order to avoid double
       -- counting, the following rules apply:

       -- 1.  No host is in more than one of the three groups defined above.
       -- 2.  All queries from the local host are always counted in the
       --     'yourself' group regardless of what the access list, if any,
       --     says.
       -- 3.  The access list should not define 'your friends' in such a way
       --     that it includes all hosts, that is 'not everybody is your
       --     friend'.
