                  A JSON Binding and Encoding for TeRI
                 draft-peterson-modern-teri-json-01.txt

Abstract

   The Telephone-Related Information (TeRI) framework defines an
   information model for data objects related to the acquisiton,
   management, and retrieval of telephone numbers and information
   related to them via the Internet.  TeRI provides an abstract
   framework that must be instantiated by a particular binding and
   encoding.  This document defines an HTTP binding for TeRI and a
   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encoding for TeRI.

1.  Introduction

   The Telephone-Related Information (TeRI) framework
   [I-D.peterson-modern-teri] defines an information model for data
   objects related to the acquisiton, management, and retrieval of
   telephone numbers and information related to them via the Internet.
   TeRI provides an abstract framework that must be instantiated by a
   particular binding and encoding, as described in
   [I-D.peterson-modern-teri] Section 6.2 and 6.3, respectively.  This
   document defines an HTTP binding and JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) [RFC7159] encoding for TeRI.  It does not however define any
   particular profile or deployment environment for using TeRI in this
   fashion; this only demonstrates an instantiation of the baseline TeRI
   specification using JSON.

   This is an early stage Internet-Draft that serves primarily as a
   vehicle to give examples of a potential syntax for TeRI Requests and
   Responses in order to facilitate discussion.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "SHOULD",
   and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
   This document also incorporates the terminology of the MODERN
   Framework [I-D.ietf-modern-problem-framework].

3.  HTTP TeRI Binding

   This specification defines a RESTful interface for getting and
   putting JSON objects related to TeRI at a web service.

   TBD.

4.  JSON TeRI Encoding

   This specification defines separate JSON objects to carry TeRI
   Requests and Responses.  All JSON objects begin with a "TeRI"
   element, which has a value stating whether the object contains a
   Request or a Response.

4.1.  TeRI Requests

   Per TeRI [I-D.peterson-modern-teri], all requests will have a Source
   and a Subject.  Optionally, a block of Query Restrictions may also
   appear in the Request.

   This simplest TeRI request will therefore have the following form:

   { "TeRI":"Retrieval",
     "Source":[{"Request":"example.com"}],
     "Subject":{"T":"12125551111"}
     }

   The "Source" element is given as an array here because a TeRI Request
   may have multiple Sources, including one "Request" Source and one or
   more "Intermediary" Sources.  All Requests have a single Subject.
   The encoding of a Subject follows the Service Types given in
   [I-D.peterson-modern-teri] Section 4.2.1.  Here, Type "T" signifies a
   single telephone number.

   Most of the complexity in Requests comes from Query Restrictions.
   Query Restrictions appear in their own JSON array, and typically
   serve to qualify a request.  In this example, the TeRI request is
   only asking for Service Records, for an SMS service (see
   [I-D.peterson-modern-teri] Section 5.5.2) associated with the
   telephone number "12125551000".

   { "TeRI":"Retrieval",
     "Source":{"Request":"example.com"},
     "Subject":{T":"12125551000"} ,
     "Restriction":[
             ("Service":"sms"} ]
     }

4.2.  TeRI Responses

   All TeRI responses will give a Response Code.  The simplest TeRI
   responses are therefore simple failure responses.

   { "TeRI":"Response",
     "Code":"Unauthorized Source"
     }

   [TBD: Note that TeRI has not allocate Response Codes yet; these will
   accompany the human-readable response indicators like "Unauthorized
   Source"]

   Most interesting TeRI responses contain Records, which are specified
   in Section 4.3.

4.3.  TeRI Records

   A TeRI Record consists of a JSON array containing a set of elements
   as defined in [I-D.peterson-modern-teri].  Records may appear in both
   TeRI Requests and Responses; for Retrieval Operations, it would be
   most common for Records to appear in Responses, when the Request
   indicates a Subject that the Source would like receive Records
   related to.

   { "TeRI":"Response",
     "Code":"Success",
     "Record:{
           "Identifier":"dc9a25c5-e44a-4dc1-9ff7-609da04bd694",
           "Authority":{"x5u":"http://example.com/cert.cert"},
           "Subject":[{T":"12125551000"}],
           "Access":"Public",
           "Service":{"sms":"sip:alice@example.com"},
           "Signature":"dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk" }
           }

   This is a simple example of a Record; more complex records may
   contain Priorities or Expiries.  Note that the Service Type here
   follows the [I-D.peterson-modern-teri] Section 4.2.1 Types, as did
   the Restrictions in the Request above.
