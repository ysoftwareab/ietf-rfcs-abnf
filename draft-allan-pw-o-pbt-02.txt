Abstract 
   This memo describes architecture and procedures for the operation of 
   pseudo wires over provider backbone transport (PBT). 
    
1. Introduction 
    
   Provider backbone transport offers a mechanism to permit scalable 
   p2p tunnels to be configured or signaled in an Ethernet subnetwork. 
   Such tunnels are suitable to function in the role of PSN in the PWE3 
   architecture. The forwarding mechanisms utilized by PBT are 
   progressing at IEEE 802 under the title "Provider Backbone Bridging- 
   Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE)". 
    
2. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   RFC 2119. 
    
   In addition to well understood GMPLS terms, this memo uses 
   terminology from IEEE 802.1 and introduces a few new terms: 
    
   B-MAC        Backbone MAC 
   B-VID        Backbone VLAN ID 
   B-VLAN       Backbone Virtual LAN 
   BEB          Backbone Edge Bridge 
   BCB          Backbone Core Bridge 
   C-MAC        Customer MAC 
   C-VID        Customer VLAN ID 
   C-VLAN       Customer Virtual LAN  
   DA           Destination Address 
   LLC          Logical Link Control 
   MAC          Media Access Control 
   PBB          Provider Backbone Bridge 
   PBT          Provider Backbone Transport 
   RTP          Real time protocol 
   SA           Source Address 
   VID          VLAN ID 
   VLAN         Virtual LAN 
    
3. Changes since previous version 
   1) Clarifications with respect to label spaces and protection groups 
      added.  
   2) References updated. 
    
4. PWoPBT architecture 
    
   PBT permits Ethernet bi-directional p2p tunnels to be configured 
   across an Ethernet subnetwork. These tunnels can be either 
   configured by management or signaled as described in [FEDYK]. 
   Frequently more than one diversely routed tunnel is set up to form a 
   protection group, the most common instantiation being 1:1 protection 
   switching.

        Figure 1.  PWE3 architecture illustrating role of PBT 
 
   Figure 1 illustrates the role of PBT in the PWE3 architecture [PW-
   ARCH]. Where PBT Ethernet PDUs are carried directly over an Ethernet 
   PHY, the PBT, data-link and physical layers are effectively a single 
   layer from the point of view of control and management. 
    
   The PWoPBT architecture takes advantage of the fact that the 
   Ethernet LLC permits multiple protocols to be simultaneously 
   multiplexed over a PBT protection group. This permits both MPLS/PW 
   payload/PDUs and IP control and OAM PDUs to be multiplexed together.

   Further, control, bearer and OAM PDUs inherently share fate with the 
   PBT tunnel or (where used) protection group simplifying the job of 
   proactive monitoring of connectivity. Where a protection group is 
   used control, OAM and bearer traffic is forwarded on the currently 
   active path of the protection group. Further the PW service may 
   directly inherit availability status from the tunnel or protection 
   group. 
    
   In addition to the regular IP Infrastructure that may be established 
   to support PSN Control Plane (routing, GMPLS signaling) exchanges, a 
   PBT tunnel may appear as a single IP hop. The IP control channel 
   allows the mode of operation to be directly analogous to channel 
   associated signaling. PW labels offered over the signaling channel 
   are directly bound to the PBT tunnel and inherit the QoS 
   characteristics of the tunnel directly.  
    
   PBT tunnels/protection groups may interconnect two U-PEs, a U-PE to 
   an S-PE, an S-PE to an S-PE. Connecting a U-PE to diverse S-PEs is 
   for further study. 
    
5. Signaling Procedures 
    
5.1 Adjacency Establishment and Session Initialization 
    
   PW control assumes an a-priori existence of a PBT protection group 
   between a given pair of PEs. 
    
   One hello adjacency will be established between any two PEs. The 
   preferred method of indicating the transport address of the PE is 
   implicit (source address in the Hello exchange). A PE implements 
   only one transport IP address. It is common to all PBT tunnel 
   terminations. This is typically the PE loopback address. 
    
   LDP extended discovery is used over the currently active path of the 
   PBT protection group. In a fault free network this will be the 
   working path. 
    
   The label space indicated in the LDP Link Hello message MUST be the 
   per-platform label space.  
    
5.2 Signaling Procedures 
    
   Once the Hello adjacency has been established, LDP session 
   initialization proceeds as per [RFC 3036]. 
    
   Label exchange procedures are as per [PW-CONTROL] for single segment 
   pseudo wires and as per [MS-PW] for multi-segment pseudo wires. 
    
5.3 Fault scenarios 
    
   Failure of a single PBT tunnel in the protection group will not 
   disrupt either the bearer path or the control adjacency. Failure of 
   all tunnels in a protection group or the failure of a PE at a

             Pseudo Wires over Provider Backbone Transport  

   terminating end to a protection group will disrupt the service. If 
   the network has not been completely severed by link failures, PBT 
   may be able to recover connectivity prior to expiration of the LDP 
   hold timer. 
    
5.4 Interworking MS-PWs 
   PBT introduces no new procedures into the interworking of MS-PWs. It 
   simply takes the role of a PSN Tunnel in one or more segments. Bi-
   directional PBT tunnels are consistent with the requirement for both 
   directions of an MS-PW to transit common S-PE devices. 
    
6. OAM Procedures 
    
6.1 Capability Indication 
   OAM capability indication procedures as per [VCCV] and extended in 
   [MOHAN] is used unmodified. 
     
6.2 Control Channel 
   In-band VCCV may be used for both SS and MS PWs without 
   modifications to procedures described in [VCCV] and [MS-PW]. 
    
6.3 VCCV BFD 
   For a single segment PW, use of VCCV BFD is not required as the PW 
   is 1:1 congruent with the transporting PBT protection group (which 
   does not implement load spreading such as ECMP) so the PBT OAM 
   effectively instruments connectivity for the set of PWs carried.  
    
   For MS-PWs where a least one segment transits a non PBT network such 
   as ECMP/LDP, VCCV BFD may be used as PSN OAM congruency with the PW 
   layer cannot be guaranteed.   
    
6.4 VCCV-PING 
   Normally the return path for a VCCV-PING reply is the PW in the 
   reverse direction. This is indicated by LSP-PING reply mode 2. It is 
   also possible to indicate that the reply traverse each segment of a 
   MS-PW by indicating a reply mode of 3 (use of router alert in the 
   reply message) although this only slightly modifies the return path 
   congruency for pure PBT architectures, and is of primary use in 
   decoupling the return path from the PW in other PSN types. 
    
6.5 VCCV-ETHOAM 
   [MOHAN] proposes the use of [802.1ag] and [Y.1731] OAM PDUs in 
   conjunction with the VCCV channel. In this scenario MEPs are co-
   located with the PW end points and for MS-PWs, MIPs are co-located 
   with the S-PEs. 
    
7. Security Considerations 
   The use of PBT as a PSN introduces no new security vulnerabilities 
   to the PWE architecture.
