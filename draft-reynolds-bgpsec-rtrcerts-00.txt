Internet-Draft     BGPSEC Router Certificate Profile           June 2011


Abstract

   This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates for
   the purposes of supporting validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths
   in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), as part of an extension to that
   protocol known as BGPSEC. BGP is a critical component for the proper
   operation of the Internet as a whole. The BGPSEC protocol is under
   development as a component to address the requirement to provide
   security for the BGP protocol. The goal of BGPSEC is to design a
   protocol for full AS path validation based on the use of strong
   cryptographic primitives. The end-entity (EE) certificates specified
   by this profile are issued under Resource PKI (RPKI) CA certificates,
   containing the RFC 3779 AS number extension, to routers within the
   autonomous system. The certificate asserts that the router(s) holding
   the public key are authorized to send out secure route advertisements
   on behalf of the specified autonomous system. Note that since these
   certificates extend the RPKI [ID.sidr-arch], this profile is based on
   the profile for RPKI resource certificates [ID.res-cert-prof].

Internet-Draft     BGPSEC Router Certificate Profile           June 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a profile for X.509 end entity (EE)
   certificates [X.509] for use in the context of certification of AS
   paths in the BGPSEC protocol. Such certificates are termed "BGPSEC
   Router certificates". The holder of the private key associated with a
   BGPSEC router certificate is authorized to send secure route
   advertisements (BGPSEC UPDATEs) on behalf of the AS named in the
   certificate. That is, a router holding the private key may send to
   its BGP peers, route advertisements that contain the specified AS
   number as the last item in the AS PATH attribute. A key property that
   BGPSEC will provide is that every autonomous system along the AS PATH
   can verify that the other ASes along the path have authorized the
   advertisement of the given route (to the next AS along the AS PATH).

   This document is a profile of [ID.res-cert-prof], which is a profile
   of RFC 5280. It establishes requirements imposed on a Resource
   certificate that is used as a BGPSEC Router certificate, i.e., it
   defines constraints for certificate fields and extensions for the
   certificate to be valid in this context. A relying party processing
   what purports to be a BGPSEC Router certificate MUST verify that the
   certificate conforms to this profile.

1.1  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5280], "X.509
   Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" [RFC3779],
   "Capability Advertisement with BGP-4" [RFC 5492], "Considerations in
   Validating the Path in BGP" [RFC 5123], "BGP Security Vulnerabilities
   Analysis" [RFC 4272], and "A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)" [RFC
   4271].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Internet-Draft     BGPSEC Router Certificate Profile           June 2011


2.  Describing Resources in Certificates

   The framework for describing an association between the subject of a
   certificate and the AS resources currently under the subject's
   control is described in RFC 3779.

   There are two aspects of this resource extension that are noted in
   this profile. First, RFC 3779 notes that a resource extension SHOULD
   be a CRITICAL extension to the X.509 certificate. This BGPSEC Router
   certificate profile further mandates that this certificate extension
   MUST appear in all BGPSEC Router certificates and MUST be marked as
   CRITICAL. Second, a test of the resource extension in the context of
   certificate validity includes the condition that the resources
   described in the immediate parent CA certificate in the PKI (the
   certificate where this certificate's issuer is the subject) has a
   resource set, hereinafter called the "issuer's resource set" that
   MUST encompass the resource set of the issued certificate. In this
   context "encompass" allows for the issuer's resource set to be the
   same as, or a strict superset of, a subject's resource set.

3.  BGPSEC Router Certificate Fields

   A BGPSEC Router Certificate is a valid X.509 public key certificate,
   consistent with the PKIX profile [RFC5380], containing the fields
   listed in this section. Unless specifically noted as being OPTIONAL,
   all the fields listed here MUST be present, and any other field MUST
   NOT appear in a conforming BGPSEC Router Certificate. If a field
   value is specified here, this value MUST be used in conforming BGPSEC
   Router certificates. For any BGPSEC Router certificate field that is
   the same as in the [ID.res-cert-prof] profile, this document will
   cite the corresponding section in that document.

3.1  Version

   Refer to section 4.1 of [ID.res-cert-prof].

3.2  Serial Number

   Refer to section 4.2 of [ID.res-cert-prof].

3.3  Signature Algorithm

   Refer to section 4.3 of [ID.res-cert-prof].

3.4  Issuer

   Refer to section 4.4 of [ID.res-cert-prof]. The value of this field
   is a distinguished name that adheres to the conventions imposed on
   Issuer (and Subject) names that appear in Resource Certificates, as
   described in [ID.sidr-arch].

3.5  Subject

   This field identifies the router to which the certificate has been
   issued. Consistent with [ID.res-cert-prof], only two attributes are
   allowed in the Subject field: common name and serial number.
   Moreover, the only common name encoding options that are supported
   are printableString and UTF8String. For router certificates, it is
   RECOMMENDED that the common name attribute contain the literal string
   "ROUTER-" followed by the 32-bit router ID encoded as eight
   hexadecimal digits. If the same certificate is issued to more than
   one router (hence the private key is shared among these routers), the
   choice of the router ID used in this name is at the discretion of the
   issuer. Note that router IDs are not guaranteed to be unique across
   the Internet, and thus the Subject name in a BGPSEC Router
   certificate issued using this convention also is not guaranteed to be
   unique across different issuers. However, each certificate issued by
   an individual CA MUST contain a subject name that is unique within

   that context.

3.6  Valid From

   Refer to section 4.6 of [ID.res-cert-prof].

3.7  Valid To

   Refer to section 4.6 of [ID.res-cert-prof].

3.8  Subject Public Key Info

   Refer to section 4.7 of [ID.res-cert-prof].

3.9  BGPSEC Router Certificate Version 3 Extension Fields

   The following X.509 V3 extensions MUST be present (or MUST be absent,
   if so stated) in a conforming BGPSEC Router certificate, except where
   explicitly noted otherwise. No other extensions are allowed in a
   conforming BGPSEC Router certificate.

3.9.1  Basic Constraints

   The basic constraints extension identifies whether the subject of the
   certificate is a CA and the maximum depth of valid certification
   paths that include this certificate. Since a BGPSEC Router
   certificate is always an EE certificate, the basic constraints
   extension MUST NOT be present.

3.9.2  Subject Key Identifier

   The subject key identifier (SKI) extension MUST appear in every
   Resource Certificate, as per section 4.8.2 of [ID.res-cert-prof]. For
   a BGPSEC Router certificate, the SKI is used as a shorthand means of
   uniquely identifying an individual certificate. The SKI in a Resource
   certificate is generated from the public key in the certificate,
   using the SHA-1 algorithm, as described in section 4.2.1.2 of RFC
   5280. This extension MUST appear in all BGPSEC Router certificates.
   This extension is non-critical.

3.9.3  Authority Key Identifier

   This is a non-critical extension and it MUST be present, as per
   section 4.8.3 of [ID.res-cert-prof].

3.9.4  Key Usage

   This is a critical extension, and it MUST be present. The

   digitalSignature bit MUST be set to TRUE in all BGPSEC Router
   certificates, and it MUST be the only bit set to TRUE.

3.9.5  Extended Key Usage

   The EKU extension MUST NOT appear in a BGPSEC Router certificate.

3.9.6  CRL Distribution Points

   The CRLDP extension is non-critical and MUST appear in every BGPSEC
   Router Certificate, as per section 4.8.6 of [ID.res-cert-prof].

3.9.7  Authority Information Access

   The AIA extension is non-critical and MUST appear in every BGPSEC
   Router Certificate, as per section 4.8.7 of [ID.res-cert-prof].

3.9.8  Subject Information Access

   This extension is not used in BGPSEC Router certificates. It MUST be
   omitted.

3.9.9  Certificate Policies

   This critical extension MUST be present as per section 4.8.9 of
   [ID.res-cert-prof].

3.9.10  IP Resources

   This extension is not used in BGPSEC Router certificates. It MUST be
   omitted.

3.9.11  AS Resources

   This extension contains the list of AS numbers that the router is
   authorized to represent in BGP advertisements, encoded as specified
   in RFC 3779. The "inherit" element MUST NOT be specified. As
   specified in section 4.8.11 of [ID.res-cert-prof], RDI values MUST
   NOT be used. All BGPSEC Router certificates MUST include an AS
   resources extension, and the extension MUST contain exactly one AS
   number. This extension MUST be marked critical.

4.  BGPSEC Router Certificate Revocation List Profile

   BGPSEC Router certificates are just another type of EE certificate
   issued by an RPKI CA. Therefore, there are no distinguishing features
   for the CRLs on which they appear. Refer to section 5 of [ID.res-
   cert-prof] for a complete description of the profile for these CRLs.

6.  BGPSEC Router Certificate Validation

   The validation procedure used for BGPSEC Router certificates is
   identical to the validation procedure described in Section 7 of
   [ID.res-cert-prof], with two further restrictions. First, all IP
   address resources for a BGPSEC Router certificate will be empty.
   Second, the sole AS number resource in the BGPSEC Router certificate
   must match the last AS number in the AS path information of each BGP
   UPDATE message. While this second restriction is not part of
   validation per se, it is part of the operational validation of
   UPDATEs performed by the router.

7.  Design Notes

   The BGPSEC Router Certificate profile is based off the Resource
   Certificate profile as specified in [ID.res-cert-prof]. As a result,
   many of the design choices herein are a reflection of the design
   choices that were taken in that prior work. The reader is referred to
   [ID.res-cert-prof] for a fuller discussion of those choices.

8.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of RFC5280 and RFC3779 apply to BGPSEC
   Router Certificates as defined by this profile, and their use.
   Additionally, the Security Considerations documented in the RPKI
   Architecture and Resource Certificate Profile [ID.res-cert-prof]
   apply.

   A BGPSEC Router Certificate is an extension of the RPKI to encompass
   routers. It is a building block of the larger BGPSEC security
   protocol used to validate signatures on BGPSEC Signature-Segment
   origination of Signed-Path segments. Thus its essential security
   function is the secure binding of an AS number to a public key,
   consistent with the RPKI allocation/assignment hierarchy.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [Note to IANA, to be removed prior to publication: there are no IANA
   considerations stated in this version of the document.]
