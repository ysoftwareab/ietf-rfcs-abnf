   Overlap signalling is a traditional feature in telecom network.  RFC
   3578 addresses how to implement it in a SIP network.  It mainly
   introduce the method to carry subsequent dialed number in INVITE.
   But there are still some issues for it.  This document gives a
   detailed discussion on another method based on INFO.  It can be
   treated as a supplementary for RFC 3578.

Internet-Draft   A method for overlap signalling in SIP   September 2005


1.  Introduction

   There are two approaches of sending overlap signalling in a SIP
   network described in RFC 3578 [2]: sending the subsequent digits in a
   SIP request (e.g., INFO [3]) within an early dialog, or sending a new
   INVITE which contains all the digits received so far every time a new
   SAM is received.  RFC 3578 mainly focuses on the INVITE method and
   doesn`t address the INFO method in detail.

   For the second approach, it can work well in the applicability scope
   of RFC 3578.  However, in some scenarios, this solution might cause
   some problems.  In this document, we will analyze the limitation of
   the second approach and have a detailed discussion about the INFO
   based solution which is based on RFC 3578.

   The limitations of sending a new INVITE to support the overlap
   signalling in real deployment are listed below.

   (1) One of the advantages of the INVITE is the re-route function.
   However, according to the section 3.1 of RFC 3578, it is required
   that all of INVITEs, which belong to a same call attempting, should
   be routed to the same gateway.  To ensure all INVITEs of a call
   reaches one gateway, routing in SIP can be controlled by the
   administrator of network.  But in some cases, because of the load
   balance and the dynamic routing in a network, it is difficult to
   fulfill this requirement.

   Figure 1: INVITEs are routed to different gateways


   For example, in the Figure 1, the MGC1 is aware of that the

   subsequent INVITEs belong to a same call attempting.  So, the MGC1
   can send these INVITEs to a same SIP proxy.  In the proxy1, there
   might be some load balance rules.  As the result, these INVITEs might
   be routed to MGC2 and MGC3 respectively.  In this case, both gateways
   generate an IAM.  Since only one of the gateways can receive the
   complete called party number, those PSTN resources consumed by
   another gateway become unwanted duplicate.  And it needs additional
   effort to release those resources.

   (2) According to the section 3.5 of RFC 3578, to bind subsequent
   INVITEs to the previous one, the gateway need to check the value of
   Call-ID and from tag.

   Figure 2: A B2BUA based SIP server involved in the path


   However, the Call-ID and From tag might be changed by a B2BUA.  For
   example, in the Figure 2, if the subsequent INVITEs are routed to the
   gateway through different paths, and in one of these paths, a B2BUA
   based SIP server is involved, then it is possible that the Call-ID
   and from tag of the subsequent INVITEs received in the gateway can
   not match to the previous one.  As the result, a new IAM will be
   generated by the gateway.  This will cause the same problem as we
   discussed above.

   One of the solutions to solve these limitations is to route the
   subsequent INVITEs following the same path as the initial INVITE was
   routed.  To ensure it, all of the SIP intermediate servers should be
   aware of the overlap signalling, which will impact the proxy behavior
   greatly.  For example, to bind the INVITEs, the proxy needs to

   analyze the Call-ID, From tag and Request-URI for every incoming
   INVITE request.

   Moreover, using reINVITE to support the overlap signalling brings the
   following disadvantages.

      (1) The INVITE transaction consumes more system resource than the
      other non-INVITE transactions.

      (2) There are some additional 4xx responses even for a successful
      call.  It will impact the statistic of the network traffic.

      (3) The subsequent INVITEs might be confused with the INVITEs
      generated by a forking.

      (4) If the SIP based application is involved, it needs to suppress
      the multiple service trigger for the subsequent INVITEs.

   According to the descriptions above, based on the RFC 3578, we
   recommend a new solution which uses INFO method to send the overlap
   signalling in a SIP network.  This solution has the following
   advantages.

      (1) By establishing the early dialog, all of the INFO requests
      automatically follow the same path as the initial INVITE was
      routed.

      (2) No more requirements to the network administrator and the
      intermediate SIP servers.

3.  Definitions

   Originating Server: An originating server is an entity that triggers
   initial overlap signalling behavior in a SIP network.  Integrated
   Access Device , Access Gateway or SIP-ISUP interworking unit may act
   as an Originating Server.

   Intermediate Server: An intermediate server is an intermediary
   network entity in a SIP network.  Proxy or B2BUA may act as an
   intermediate server.

   Terminating Server: A terminating server is a network entity that
   terminates the overlap signalling behavior in a SIP network.  B2BUA
   or SIP-ISUP interworking unit may act as a Terminating Server.

4.  Overlap signalling in a SIP network

   This section describes the solution of overlap signalling in a SIP
   network.

   When there is overlap signalling behavior in the network, the
   Originating Server uses INFO request to carry the subsequent numbers,
   and sends it to next-hop network entity as a message within a dialog.

   1.  The Originating Server is configured to support overlap
       signalling.  It waits for the minimum amount of digits to route a
       call.  Once the minimum amount of digits has been received, the
       Originating Server will generate an INVITE request with the
       received called number and then will send it to next-hop server.

   2.  The Originating Server uses INFO request to carry the subsequent
       digits.  The subsequent digits are carried in the message body of
       INFO request.

       *  If the interface between the Originating Server and next-hop
          server is SIP-I [6], subsequent digits are carried by a SAM
          encapsulated in the INFO request.

       *  If the interface between the Originating Server and next-hop
          server is SIP, subsequent digits are carried by x-session-info
          message body (See Section 5) in the INFO request.

   3.  If the Terminating Server supports overlap signalling solution
       described in this specification, it MUST send a reliable 183
       response according to RFC3262 [4] when it received an INVITE
       request with incomplete called number.  This 183 response creates
       an early dialog, which ensures that subsequent digits can be
       carried through INFO request(s) in the same dialog.

   4.  The Originating Server MUST NOT send any INFO request until it
       receives 183 response that creates an early dialog.

   5.  The Originating Server MUST NOT send a new INFO request until it
       receives final response for the previous INFO request.

                 Figure 4: multiple SAMs mapped to one INFO request


   6.  The Originating Server may receive more than one SAM before it
       sends a new INFO request.  Multiple SAMs can be merged into one
       INFO request.  Alternatively, the Originating Server can also
       send multiple INFO requests each with one SAM encapsulated.  An
       implementation is free to take any approach to deal with the
       mapping of multiple SAMs.

5.  x-session-info

   When the interface between the Originating Server and next-hop server
   is SIP, subsequent number is carried by in the INFO request.  For
   that purpose, this document defines a new message body, application/
   x-session-info, which can be used to carry additional number/address
   information.

   x-session-info = CalledParty

   CalledParty = "CalledParty" HCOLON addr-spec

   The userinfo part of the addr-spec MUST contain all the digits
   received so far.

   In this case, INFO request MUST contain a message body with the type
   of "application/x-session-info", and this INFO request MUST NOT
   contain any ISUP encapsulation.

6.  Entity behavior for overlap signalling

6.1.  Originating Server Behavior

   The Originating Server should support RFC 3262 [4], so that an early
   dialog can be established through a reliable 183 response.

6.1.1.  SIP-ISUP Interworking Function (IWF) Behavior

   When an IAM is received, if the Originating Server can determine the
   route to next hop, it will send an INVITE with the current available
   called party number carried in To and Request-URI.  If it can not
   determine the route to next hop and the number is incomplete (as
   indicated in IAM), it should wait until the number is sufficient or
   timeout.

   Note: by network management, Intermediate Servers can always
   determine the route to next hop based on the called party number in
   INVITE message.

   The Originating Server may receive subsequent SAMs after INVITE is
   sent out.  It MUST NOT map them to INFO(s) until the early dialog is
   established.

   If multiple SAMs are received, the Originating Server can map them
   into one or more INFO messages.

   The mapping of INFO should follow the rules described below:

   1)   The generation of INFO message should follow the rule described
        in section 12.2.1.1 of RFC 3261. [1]

   2)   Subsequent digits should be carried in the INFO message body:

        *  When SIP is used, an new message body x-session-info is
           introduced in this document.  Please refer to section 5.

        *  When SIP-I is used, the SAM can be encapsulated in INFO,
           x-session-info MUST NOT be used in this situation.

   Note: If 183 is only used to establish the early dialog, there is no
   need to map it to ACM.

6.1.2.  SIP based IAD or AG Behavior

   For SIP based IAD or AG, overlap signalling may also be used.  It can
   also use the new message body x-session-info to carry subsequent
   dialed digits if needed.

6.2.  Intermediate Server Behavior

   Intermediate Server may be Proxy or B2BUA.

   If required, network operator can guarantee the routing of
   Intermediate Server by network management.  For example, specify the
   minimal length of number collected before INVITE can be sent at the
   Originating Server.

6.3.  Terminating Server Behavior

   The Terminating Server will take the responsibility of terminating
   the overlap signalling in a SIP network.

   If it acts as a SIP-ISUP interworking unit, it may still use overlap
   signalling in the PSTN side, or it may terminate the overlap
   procedure and convert it to en-bloc signalling.

   It may also act as a B2BUA, in this case, it should be able to
   terminate the incomming SIP overlap procedure and process the
   outgoing SIP session in either overlap or en-bloc mode.

6.3.1.  SIP-ISUP IWF Behavior

   This section describes the behavior of Terminating Server (acting as
   SIP-ISUP IWF).

6.3.1.1.  Continue Overlap signalling in PSTN

   1)  If the information in INVITE is sufficient to route to the next-
       hop, IWF can immediately send IAM, otherwise it should wait for
       subsequent INFO, until sufficient called address info is
       received.

   2)  SIP-ISUP IWF should send a reliable 183 immediately after INVITE
       is received.

       The purpose of this 183 is to establish an early dialog as soon
       as possible, so that subsequent overlapped number can be
       delivered by INFO.  It must be reliable, and contain To tag and
       Contact.  It should also copy the Record-Route header from
       INVITE.  No message body should be included in the 183 response.

   3)  When subsequent INFO message is received, the Terminating Server
       should judge if there is x-session-info or SAM contained.  If
       exists, it should be mapped to SAM.

6.3.1.2.  Convert to en-bloc in PSTN

   Refer to section 6.3.2.

6.3.2.  B2BUA Behavior

   For Terminating B2BUA, it should terminate the overlap signalling and
   convert it to en-bloc mode.  It must be able to analyze the called
   party number.

   If the called party number is incomplete, Terminating Server should
   send 183 to establish early dialog [refer to section 6.3.1.1], and
   then wait for subsequent number.  The Terminating Server should also
   start timer T35 (as defined in ITU-T Q.764 [5]) to wait for
   subsequent number.  The length of T35 is implementation specific and
   is recommended to be 15~20 seconds.  When the number is collected
   completely, it can then forward the INVITE with updated called party
   number info to the next hop. if there is still not sufficient number
   received after T35 timeout, the Terminating Server should send 484 or
   404 to reject the session.

   Specifically, if the number is complete in the initial INVITE, the
   Terminating Server can forward the INVITE directly and may not need
   to send 183 response to establish early dialog.

7.  Additional requirements for Originating Server

   If one of the Intermediate Server can not determine the route to the
   next hop according to the initial INVITE, it will normally return 404
   or 484 to reject the request.  In this situation, the Originating
   Server can act in two way: Convert subsequent overlap signalling into
   SIP en-bloc Signalling or continue trying to sending overlap
   signalling to a SIP Network as section 6 in this document.  The
   decision can be made by configuration.

7.1.  Convert subsequent overlap signalling into SIP en-bloc Signalling

   Like the precedures described in section 2 RFC 3578, the Originating
   server may decide to convert the overlap procedure to en-bloc
   signalling by waiting for the termination indication of dialed
   number(such as, #) or T10 timeout, and then send a new INVITE with
   all the numbers received.  This time, the INVITE starts a new
   session.

7.2.  Continue trying to sending overlap signalling to a SIP Network

   Also like section 3 in RFC 3578, if the Originating Server would like
   to retry the overlap procudure when additional number(s) is received,
   it can send a new INVITE with all the numbers received so far.  The
   subsequent procedure is the same as section 6.1.

8.  Security Considerations

   Since this method is based on exiting SIP mechanism like INFO, 183,
   PRACK.  There are no other specific security issues here.
