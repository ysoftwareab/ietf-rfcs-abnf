Abstract

   This memo specifies how IPv6 only mobile nodes (MN) receiving
   network-based mobility management using Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)
   can communicate with IPv4 only servers.  The protocol is based on
   local mobility anchors maintaining a table similar to NAT64 and
   linking it to the binding cache.  This technique avoids the problems
   encountered when NAT64 is used for mobile nodes.  How IPv6 only
   mobile nodes can receive multicast data from IPv4 only content
   providers is also explained.

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for PMIPv6                   June 2010


1.  Introduction

   With IPv4 address depletion on the horizon, many techniques are being
   standardized for IPv6 migration including NAT64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].  NAT64 together with DNS64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] enables IPv6-only hosts to communicate with
   IPv4-only servers.

   NAT64 is designed for fixed hosts.  When used for mobile nodes
   several problems occur as described in
   [I-D.haddad-mext-nat64-mobility-harmful].  In this document we
   redesign NAT64 for network based mobility protocol called Proxy
   Mobile IPv6.  The design uses DNS64 as is and integrates NAT64
   operation with the binding cache of Proxy Mobile IPv6.

   The document continues in Section 3 with a set of requirements on a
   solution for NAT64 for Proxy Mobile IPv6.  In Section 4 the protocol
   design is presented, multicast translation is explained in Section 5
   while handover and localized routing cases are covered in Section 6
   for unicast.  In Section 7 extensions to PMIPv6 are described.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC5213],
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful], [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] and
   [RFC5844].


3.  Requirements

   NAT64 has two main problems if used for the mobile nodes: the first
   one is related to mobility and the second one is related to NAT
   keepalives.  DNS64 may use the IPv6 prefix assigned to the NAT64 IPv6
   interface in the domain in translating IPv4 address of the server to
   an IPv6 address.  When the mobile node moves to a different domain
   the IPv6 prefix changes and as a result, the mobile node gets a
   different IPv6 address for the same correspondent host it was
   communicating before.  However in Proxy Mobile IPv6, the mobile node
   is anchored at the local mobility anchor which receives packets
   reverse tunneled from the mobile node and sends them to their
   destinations.  In this case the packets from the local mobility
   anchor will likely not reach their destination for properly
   translating into IPv4 packets and will get dropped
   [I-D.haddad-mext-nat64-mobility-harmful].

   NAT64 protocol should enable host mobility.  This requirement is met
   by redesigning NAT64 protocol so that the mobility anchor which keeps

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for PMIPv6                   June 2010


   track of the host's mobility knows about all prefixes used.

   NAT64 is a NAT device which keeps NAT table as the NAT state
   [RFC3519].  NAT state is soft state and it expires if it is not
   refreshed during a certain time interval.  NAT keepalives sent by the
   host are used for this purpose.  Mobile nodes go to sleep mode when
   inactive in which battery usage is minimized.  However sending NAT
   keepalive messages may drain the mobile node's battery because it has
   to cut short its sleep mode.

   NAT keepalives should be avoided for the mobile nodes.  This
   requirement is met by integrating NAT64 state with binding cache that
   the mobility anchor creates for the mobile node in order to keep
   track of its mobility.  NAT64 state is refreshed automatically when
   the mobile node's binding cache entry is refreshed and in case of
   Proxy Mobile IPv6, Mobile Access Gateway refreshes it not the mobile
   node so no battery consumption is needed.

   While resolving issues of NAT64 related to mobility, it is desirable
   to keep compatibility with fixed hosts.  This requirement is met by
   reusing DNS64 for mobile nodes as well.

   NAT64 translates IPv6 packet into IPv4 packet and vice versa and the
   translation algorithm is defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate].
   However translation algorithm is deficient in that IPv6 extension
   headers (except fragmentation header) and IPv4 options are not
   translated.  Proxy Mobile IPv6 uses extension header in registration
   signaling using PBU/PBA messages.  PBU/PBA are exchanged between MAG
   and LMA and not between mobile node and correspondent node.  Because
   of this the deficiency is avoided.

   The behaviour of IPv4-only or dual stack mobile nodes using network
   based mobility protocol Proxy Mobile IPv6 is specified in [RFC5844].
   However this document does not specify how IPv6-only mobile nodes can
   access IPv4-only servers.  Hence this specification complements
   [RFC5844].

   NAT64 is designed for unicast communication, the translation
   algorithm is defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] does not
   translate multicast packets.  IPv6 only hosts receiving multicast
   data from IPv4 only servers is not covered.

   For many applications multicast communication for mobile nodes is a
   requirement.  This requirement is met by designing a multicast
   translation scheme for Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This technique applies to
   any source multicast.

4.  Unicast Translation

   When forwarding packets sent by the mobile node, the local mobility
   anchor first checks the Source Address field in the binding cache.  A
   further check is made if the destination address's prefix matches
   Pref64.  In case of a match, IPv6-only flag in the binding cache
   entry for the mobile node is set if it was not set already.

   LMA generates an IPv4 packet and sends it to the destination IPv4-
   only server from its IPv4 interface.  We assume that IPv4 interface
   address is 203.0.113.1 as in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].
   As in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful], LMA selects an available
   source port, e.g. 2000 which becomes IPv4 packet source port and
   creates a "NAT state" of

   <MN source address, IPv6 source port> <--> <IPv4 Interface address,
   IPv4 source port>

   This state is linked to the binding cache entry for MN.  In
   generating IPv4 packet, destination IPv4 address is derived from the
   the last 32 bits of destination address of IPv6 packet, e.g.
   192.0.2.1 and destination port of IPv6 packet is set to the
   destination port of IPv4 packet.  IPv6 packet is translated into an
   IPv4 packet following the algorithm presented in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate].

   When forwarding any subsequent packets for the same session
   corresponding to <MN source address, source port>, LMA finds the
   corresponding entry in the NAT table and creates the corresponding
   IPv4 packet using this entry.  The above procedure is repeated only
   when a new session is started by MN.

   When LMA receives a packet addressed to its IPv4 interface it
   searches the NAT table for the corresponding MN IPv6 source address
   and port.  For example the tuple <203.0.113.1, 2000> would match the
   network-specific prefix (NSP) of 2001:FF00::/64 and the source port
   of 1500.  LMA creates an IPv6 packet from IPv4 packet using this
   information.  IPv4 packet is translated into an IPv6 packet following
   the algorithm presented in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate].  Next LMA
   fetches MN's binding cache entry and finds the MAG MN is associated
   with.  LMA encapsulates IPv6 packet and sends it to the MAG.


5.  Multicast Translation

   In this section we specify how mobile node can receive IPv4 multicast
   data from IPv4-only content provider based on currently adopted base
   solution for supporting multicast in Proxy Mobile IPv6

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for PMIPv6                   June 2010


   [I-D.ietf-multimob-pmipv6-base-solution].

   IPv6-only mobile node will join IPv4 multicast group by sending MLD
   Membership Report message to MLD Proxy which is located at the mobile
   access gateway.  Mobile node will use synthesized IPv6 address of
   IPv4 multicast group address, e.g. a /96 prefix used for any source
   multicast called IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix followed by a.b.c.d, IPv4
   multicast group address.  IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix takes the form of
   FFxx::/96, it is non-SSM prefix [I-D.venaas-behave-mcast46].
   Multicast router at the local mobility anchor receives an aggregate
   join message from the mobile access gateway for the group
   IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix:a.b.c.d.

   Each local mobility anchor is assigned a unique IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS
   prefix.  Mobile nodes can learn this value by means out of scope with
   this document.  With this, mobile node can easily create an IPv6
   multicast address from the IPv4 group address a.b.c.d that it wants
   to join.

   Local mobility anchor as multicast anchor checks the group address
   and recognizes IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix.  It next checks the last 32
   bits is an IPv4 multicast address in range 224/8 - 239/8.  If all
   checks succeed, local mobility anchor joins a.b.c.d using IGMP on its
   IPv4 interface.

   When local mobility anchor receives multicast data for the group
   a.b.c.d, it first obtains the IPv6 address IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix:
   a.b.c.d and then checks to see if it has any outgoing interfaces
   towards the mobile access gateway which happens when at least one
   mobile node is subscribed to this address.  Local mobility anchor
   will then translate IPv4 multicast data packet into an IPv6 multicast
   data packet.  The destination address is IPv6 group address
   IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix:a.b.c.d and source address is local
   mobility anchor's IPv6 interface address.  IPv4 payload is copied
   into IPv6 payload.

   Multicast translation described in this section is mobile node
   agnostic.  Local mobility anchor gets Multicast Listener Discovery
   messages from the proxy instance in one of the mobile access gateways
   when the membership database of the mobile access gateway changes.
   For the local mobility anchor it is sufficient to know if there is at
   least one member in the corresponding downstream Multicast Listener
   Discovery proxy instance and because of this local mobility anchor
   does not need to consult its binding cache.

6.  Handover and Localized Routing

   In Proxy Mobile IPv6 mobile node is always at home, i.e. its home
   address does not change even if it moves.  If the move is within the
   same domain served by the same DNS64 entity the mobile node can
   continue to send/receive packets with IPv4 only server and the
   protocol defined in Section 4 can be used for translating IPv6
   packets into IPv4 and vice versa.

   If MN moves to a domain where DNS64 entity changes MN initiates
   communication with IPv4-only server, it gets a different synthetic
   AAAA RR with a different IPv6 address of the destination.  MN sends
   its IPv6 packet to the local MAG which tunnels it to MN's LMA.

   LMA checks the source address (mobile node's home address) in the
   binding cache for any entry with IPv6-only flag set.  Next
   destination address's prefix is checked in a list of Pref64's that
   are supported.  In case of a match, LMA continues to create an IPv4
   packet as described in Section 4.  In addition LMA also removes all
   NAT table entries matching MN source address since MN is no longer
   using the same Pref64.  If IPv6-only flag is not set then this is the
   first packet sent to a new IPv4-only server.  LMA processes this
   packet as described in Section 4.

   The effect of handover on multicast translation depends on how
   IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix is configured.  Mobile node may get a
   different IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix locally after moving to a new
   mobile access gateway.  Mobile node sends a join request (Multicast
   Listener Discovery Report message) with a new multicast group
   address.  Local mobility anchor adds this group address to its
   membership database.  Local mobility anchor MUST add the new
   IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix to the multicast prefix table.

   Localized routing in PMIPv6 is used to avoid reverse tunneling every
   packet to local mobility anchor by enabling the MAG to directly send
   the packets to another MAG where the correspondent node for this
   mobile node is associated [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip6-lr-ps].  The other
   MAG may be connected to a different LMA.

   NAT64 for PMIPv6 is supported at the local mobility anchor not at the
   mobile access gateway so it would not work when localized routing is
   used.  Since NAT64 assumes that MN is communicating with IPv4-only
   servers these servers are not expected to be associated with any
   mobile access gateway in the domain.  This means that no trigger can
   be found to initiate localized routing for communication between the
   mobile node and IPv4-only server.

7.  Extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6

   Binding cache entry contains the following new entry:

   A flag indicating whether or not this mobile node is IPv6-only node.

   IPv6-only flag is set after receiving the first IPv6 packet
   containing a synthetic IPv6 address.  This flag is used to connect
   the binding cache with the NAT table.

   Local mobility anchor keeps a NAT table for IPv6-only mobile nodes
   communicating with IPv4-only servers.  NAT table contains at a
   minimum entries for associating MN source address, IPv6 source port
   to the corresponding IPv4 interface address of the local mobility
   anchor and source port information.

   MN source address in the NAT table MUST correspond to a binding cache
   entry with IPv6-only flag set.

   Local mobility anchor has a table of NAT64 prefixes, Pref64 that are
   supported in PMIPv6 domain and its roaming partners.  For each
   Pref64, local mobility anchor keeps a 32-bit suffix which is
   concatenated to the prefix.  The resulting 96-bit value is
   concatenated with IPv4 address of the destination IPv4-only server to
   obtain the synthesized IPv6 address.

   If the Well-Known Prefix is used this table contains 64:FF9B::/96.
   In this case there is no associated suffix.

7.1.  Multicast Extensions

   Multicast anchor at the local mobility anchor MUST support at least
   one IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix.  Multicast anchor at the local
   mobility anchor MUST support IGMP on its IPv4 interface.

   Local mobility anchor has a table of IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefixes.
   This table normally contains a single entry, i.e. the local prefix
   value.  It may be populated by more entries in case of handover as
   described in Section 6.  The entries are kept as soft-state and
   removed after a period of no activity.


8.  Security Considerations

   For IPv4-only or dual stack mobile nodes security considerations
   stated in [RFC5844] apply.  This document specifies additional
   procedures PMIPv6 for the case of IPv6-only mobile nodes which are
   not covered in [RFC5844].  Security considerations for IPv4 interface
