1.  Introduction

   This memo updates the IANA registry rules for the Telephony Routing
   over IP (TRIP) protocol, by no longer requiring that postal addresses
   be included in contact information.  No use for the addresses is
   identified, and omitting this information provides a privacy benefit.

   This memo updates RFC 3219.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This memo updates the registration rules [RFC8126] for TRIP
   Attributes ([RFC3219], Section 13.2) and TRIP ITAD Numbers
   ([RFC3219], Section 13.5) as follows.

   IANA will no longer collect postal address information when adding
   TRIP registry entries.  Additionally, IANA should no longer publish
   previously collected postal addresses.

3.  Security Considerations

   No security impacts of this change have been identified.

4.  Acknowledgements
