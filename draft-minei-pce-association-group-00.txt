  PCEP Extensions for establishing relationships between sets of LSPs
                  draft-minei-pce-association-group-00

Abstract

   This document introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of
   LSPs in the context of stateful PCE.  This grouping can then be used
   to define associations between sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs
   and a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters or
   behaviors), and is equally applicable to the active and passive modes
   of stateful PCE.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol PCEP.  PCEP
   enables the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
   a Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCE, for the purpose
   of computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) characteristics.

   Stateful pce [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]  specifies a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of TE LSPs between and
   across PCEP sessions in compliance with [RFC4657] and focuses on a
   model where LSPs are configured on the PCC and control over them is
   delegated to the PCE.  The model of operation where LSPs are
   initiated from the PCE is described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].

Internet-Draft            PCE association group                June 2014


   This document introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of
   LSPs.  This grouping can then be used to define associations between
   sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such
   as configuration parameters or behaviors), and is equally applicable
   to the active and passive modes of stateful PCE.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP Peer.

3.  Architectural Overview

3.1.  Motivation

   Stateful PCE provides the ability to update existing LSPs and to
   instantiate new ones.  To enable support for PCE-controlled make-
   before-break and for protection, there is a need to define
   associations between LSPs.  For example, the association between the
   original and the reoptimized path in the make-before break scenario,
   or between the working and protection path in end-to-end protection.
   Another use for LSP grouping is for applying a common set of
   configuration parameters or behaviors to a set of LSPs.  Rather than
   creating separate mechanisms for each use case, this draft defines a
   generic one.

3.2.  Operation overview

   LSPs are associated with other LSPs with which they interact by
   adding them to a common association group.  Association groups as
   defined in this document are locally meaningful at the LSP head-end,
   and can only be applied to LSPs originating at that head end.  Thus,
   the association identifiers are unique at each head end, but not
   necessarily across the network, and are owned and managed by the head
   end.

   Multiple types of groups can exist, each with their own identifiers
   space.  The definition of the different association types and their
   behaviors is outside the scope of this document.  The establishment
   and removal of the association relationship can be done on a per LSP
   basis.  There is support for removal of all LSPs from an association
   as well.  An LSP may join multiple association groups, of different
   or of the same type.

4.  LSP association groups

   Association groups are owned by the PCC, but the PCE may request
   creation of an association group (for example before instantiating
   LSPs that belong to that group).  Membership in an association group
   can be initiated by either the PCE or the PCC.  Association groups
   and their memberships are defined using the Association object.

   The Association Object is an optional object in the PCupd, PCRpt and
   PCinit messages.

   The format of the Association object is shown Figure 1:


   0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |Type   |  Generic flags    |R| Type-specific flags             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |             Association group id                              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      //            Optional TLVs                                    //
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                  Figure 1: The Association Object format

   Type - the association type (for example protection or make-before-
   break).  The association type will be defined in separate documents.

   Generic flags - flags for the association object.  A single one is
   defined, the R flag indicating removal from the association group.

   Type-specific flags - specific to the association type, will be
   defined at the time of the association type.

   Association group id - identifier of the association group.  The
   values 0 and 0xffffffff are reserved.  Value 0 is used when the PCE
   requests allocation of an association group.  Value 0xffffffff
   indicates all association groups.

5.  Using the LSP association group

   Membership in an association group is reported in PCRpt messages by
   including the association object along with the LSP object.  Removal
   of the LSP from the association group on the PCC (for example through
   configuration) is reported by including the association object with
   the R flag set.  When an LSP belongs to multiple association groups,

Internet-Draft            PCE association group                June 2014


   multiple association objects are included in the PCRpt, one for each
   association the LSP belongs to.  A PCE can associate an LSP that was
   delegated to it (the candidate LSP) with an existing association
   group, by sending a PCUpd for the candidate LSP, including the
   Association Object for the association group.  Error handling for
   this operation will be defined in a future version of this draft.

   An association group can be created locally at the PCC (for example
   through configuration) or it can be requested by the PCE.  A PCE may
   request the creation of an association group by sending a PCUpd
   message with the reserved value 0.  In response to this request, the
   PCC will allocate an association group id and report it in the PCRpt
   message.  Error handling will be defined in a future version of this
   draft.  Note that this operation includes creation of the group and
   association of one LSP with this group.  Requesting the creation of
   an association group before the LSP exists will be handled in a
   future version of this draft.

6.  IANA considerations

   This document defines the following new PCEP Object-classes and
   Object-values:

    Object-Class Value  Name                               Reference

           TBD          Association                        This document
                        Object-Type
                        1

   This document requests that a registry is created to manage the Flags
   field of the Association object.  New values are to be assigned by
   Standards Action [RFC5226].

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   apply to the extensions described in this document.  Additional
   considerations related to a malicious PCE are introduced, as the PCE
   may now create additional state on the PCC through the creation of
   association groups.

   We would like to thank Yuji Kamite and Joshua George for their
   contributions to this document.
