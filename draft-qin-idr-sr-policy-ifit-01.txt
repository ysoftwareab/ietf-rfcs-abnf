                BGP SR Policy Extensions to Enable IFIT
                    draft-qin-idr-sr-policy-ifit-01

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) policy is a set of candidate SR paths consisting
   of one or more segment lists and necessary path attributes.  It
   enables instantiation of an ordered list of segments with a specific
   intent for traffic steering.  In-situ Flow Information Telemetry
   (IFIT) refers to network OAM applications that apply dataplane on-
   path telemetry techniques.  This document defines extensions to BGP
   to distribute SR policies carrying IFIT information.  So that IFIT
   methods can be enabled automatically when the SR policy is applied.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]
   is a set of candidate SR paths consisting of one or more segment
   lists and necessary path attributes.  It enables instantiation of an
   ordered list of segments with a specific intent for traffic steering.

   In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (IFIT) refers to network OAM
   applications that apply dataplane on-path telemetry techniques,
   including In-situ OAM (IOAM) [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] and Alternate
   Marking [RFC8321].  It can provide flow information on the entire
   forwarding path on a per- packet basis in real time.

   An automatic network requires the Service Level Agreement (SLA)
   monitoring on the deployed service.  So that the system can quickly
   detect the SLA violation or the performance degradation, hence to
   change the service deployment.  The SR policy native IFIT can
   facilitate the closed loop control, and enable the automation of SR
   service.

   This document defines extensions to BGP to distribute SR policies
   carrying IFIT information.  So that IFIT behavior can be enabled
   automatically when the SR policy is applied.

   This BGP extension allows to signal the IFIT capabilities together
   with the SR-policy.  In this way IFIT methods are automatically
   activated and running.  The flexibility and dynamicity of the IFIT
   applications are given by the use of additional functions on the
   controller and on the network nodes, but this is out of scope here.

   It is to be noted the companion document
   [I-D.chen-pce-sr-policy-ifit] that proposes the PCEP extension to
   enable IFIT applications for SR policy.

2.  IFIT Attributes in SR Policy

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy], the SR Policy
   encoding structure is as follows:

         SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
         Attributes:
            Tunnel Encaps Attribute (23)
               Tunnel Type: SR Policy
                   Binding SID
                   Preference
                   Priority
                   Policy Name
                   Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP)
                   Segment List
                       Weight
                       Segment
                       Segment
                       ...
                   ...

   A candidate path includes multiple SR paths, each of which is
   specified by a segment list.  IFIT can be applied to the candidate
   path, so that all the SR paths can be monitored in the same way.  The
   new SR Policy encoding structure is expressed as below:

         SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
         Attributes:
            Tunnel Encaps Attribute (23)
               Tunnel Type: SR Policy
                   Binding SID
                   Preference
                   Priority
                   Policy Name
                   Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP)
                   IFIT Attributes
                   Segment List
                       Weight
                       Segment
                       Segment
                       ...
                   ...

   IFIT attributes can be attached at the candidate path level as sub-
   TLVs.  There may be different IFIT tools.  The following sections
   will describe the requirement and usage of different IFIT tools, and
   define the corresponding sub-TLV encoding in BGP.

   Note that the IFIT attributes here described can also be generalized
   and included as sub-TLVs for other SAFIs and NLRIs.

3.  SR Policy for IOAM

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] records operational and telemetry
   information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between
   two points in the network.  In terms of the classification given in
   RFC 7799 [RFC7799] IOAM could be categorized as Hybrid Type 1.  IOAM
   mechanisms can be leveraged where active OAM do not apply or do not
   offer the desired results.

   When SR policy enables the IOAM, the IOAM header will be inserted
   into every packet of the traffic that is steered into the SR paths.

   This document aims to define the control plane.  While a relevant
   document for the data plane is [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options] for
   Segment Routing over IPv6 data plane (SRv6).

3.1.  IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option Sub-TLV

   The IOAM tracing data is expected to be collected at every node that
   a packet traverses to ensure visibility into the entire path a packet
   takes within an IOAM domain.  The preallocated tracing option will
   create pre-allocated space for each node to populate its information.

   follows:

4.  SR Policy for Enhanced Alternate Marking

   The Alternate Marking [RFC8321]technique is an hybrid performance
   measurement method, per RFC 7799 [RFC7799] classification of
   measurement methods.  Because this method is based on marking
   consecutive batches of packets.  It can be used to measure packet
   loss, latency, and jitter on live traffic.

   This document aims to define the control plane.  While a relevant
   document for the data plane is [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark] for
   Segment Routing over IPv6 data plane (SRv6).

   The format of EAM sub-TLV is defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Where:

   Type: to be assigned by IANA.

   Length: the total length of the value field not including Type and
   Length fields.

   FlowMonID: A 20-bit identifier to uniquely identify a monitored flow
   within the measurement domain.  The definition is the same as
   described in section 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark].

   Period: Time interval between two alternate marking period.  The unit
   is second.

   Rsvd: A 4-bit field reserved for further usage.  It MUST be zero.
