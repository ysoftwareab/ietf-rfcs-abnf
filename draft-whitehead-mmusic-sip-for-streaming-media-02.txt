Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media            October 2006


1.  Introduction

   IP-based networks are continually improving in terms of bandwidth
   capacity and transport quality of service.  At the same time,
   broadband services are continually expanding globally -- both in
   terms of reach and value-added.  These developments are leading to an
   increase in the number and variety of deployment scenarios for
   streaming media applications.  Many of these scenarios impose
   challenging new requirements on the signaling protocols used for
   these applications in terms of flexibility, scalability and network
   independence.

   Historically, RTSP [3] and [4] has been the protocol of choice for
   streaming media applications and has covered both session control and
   media control.  An obvious approach to address these new requirements
   then is to extend RTSP.  This strategy appears to be able to address
   some of the new requirements, but not others.  In particular
   extending RTSP to meet some of these new requirements would involve
   introducing protocol mechanisms that already exist elsewhere, namely
   in SIP and its associated extensions.

   An alternative approach is to consider the possibility of using SIP
   for some of the functions needed by streaming media applications.
   While historically SIP has been used for communication services, the
   protocol itself is flexible enough (by design) to signal a wide
   variety of media streams.  Moreover, driven in large part by the
   requirements associated with IP-based communication services, SIP has
   been extended over the years to address many of the same requirements
   currently facing next-generation media streaming applications.
   Rather than reinvent or duplicate protocol mechanisms in RTSP that
   already exist in SIP, a reasonable strategy may be to find a way to
   use SIP instead or in conjunction with RTSP.

   This document presents some of the use cases that suggest a
   convergence between SIP and RTSP.  These will also be eventually used
   to derive requirements on the service signaling protocol.  Then,
   high-level strategies will be defined.

   The goal of the draft is not propose all SIP or SIP/RTSP solutions
   but to considers possible ways in which RTSP is not sufficient for
   some streaming media applications and where SIP could fill the gap.
   The purpose of the document is to give a list of use-cases (section
   3), a list of derived capabilities (section 4)", a rationale for
   considering SIP in conjunction with RTSP (section 5), and
   recommendations for future work (section 6).  The technical solution
   options may be investigated in a future draft based on the current
   document.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

   See [3] and [2] for terminology.


3.  Use Case Scenarios

   The scope of scenarios for this document includes applications with
   the following characteristics: content-on-demand, streaming media,
   unicast-media streams, live or recorded content, ubiquitous access
   (any-device, any-access).

   While of interest, non-streaming media applications, such as
   downloaded media services, are outside the scope of this document.

3.1.  Characteristics

   For the purposes of this document, the term 'controlled streaming
   media application' represents a class of applications with the
   following characteristics:
   o  Multiple servers that can be a source of content but showing up as
      a single muxed stream at the client.
   o  One or more clients can receive the content.
   o  The media stream(s) needs to be delivered isochronously, in the
      most common case: the client intends to begin rendering the media
      before delivery is complete.
   o  Less common but equally valid, the server does not have resources
      to buffer content until the client is ready to receive it, e.g., a
      live feed.
   o  A session exists between source (e.g. server or peer) and
      destination (e.g. client or peer).
   o  The session is established, managed, and terminated through the
      use of a signaling protocol, in which control messages are
      exchanged (either directly or indirectly) between the source and
      the destination referred to as 'session signaling'.
   o  The application supports media stream control.

   The client(s), or a proxy element acting on behalf of the client(s),
   has the ability to manipulate the media stream (or other aspect of
   the application) via signaling.  This is referred to as application-
   signaling (or media control signaling).

3.2.  Use Case Descriptions

   As IP-based broadband data services have continued to develop and
   expand, opportunities for streaming media applications have also
   proliferated and expanded beyond the traditional framework.  This
   section describes several streaming media application use case
   scenarios.  These scenarios illustrate the variety of conditions and
   environments in which streaming media applications need to operate.

   Use cases are used with the purpose of clarifying the 'streaming
   media application' and to explore the application space.  The
   objectives are to:
   o  Clarify the frame / scope the discussion.
   o  Illustrate some of usage scenarios.
   o  Identify some of the key attributes that characterize these use
      cases.

3.2.1.  Video Surveillance

   This is the first of a number of use cases that relate to
   "conversational video".  In this use case a user wants:
   o  Either to switch from the unidirectional audio-video monitoring
      session into a 2-way (bi-directional) conversation when wanting to
      interact with an unknown visitor.  In this case the session is
      "upgraded" from one-way to two-way.
   o  Or to switch from the unidirectional "live" received content to a
      unidirectional "recorded" content with a rewind "play trick
      command".

   Instead of RTSP, SIP can be used to setup the communication, which
   provides the ability to switch from the one-way monitoring
   communication to the bidirectional communication.  RTSP features
   related to trick plays can be used to remotely interact on the
   stream.  For example the remote viewer should be able to place a
   rewind command to the previously recorded content.  This is one use
   case for the convergence of both protocols.

3.2.2.  Blended services/videoconferencing

   In this use case, the user wants to switch between a "bidirectional"
   live conversation to a "unidirectional" recorded content.  This use
   case is also for multiple services (streaming/communications/info) to
   use common signaling infrastructure.  In this case SIP is again used
   for authentication billing and location.  RTSP allows the remote
   viewer/user to place a "trick mode" rewind into a command
   videoconferencing context (to see what happened before joining in).

Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media            October 2006


3.2.3.  Sharing a video with another person over a multi-media call

   This is another "conversational video" use case.  A user already in
   an audio-video conversation (using a SIP based protocol) wants to
   provide local audio-video content to the called party.  If the remote
   user wants to watch the live content (you should see what I am
   witnessing now) or request the content (can I look at the game you
   recorded yesterday?), a lot of the communication setup, generally
   established by RTSP, can be avoided with SIP the relationship
   (including authentication and billing) between the two parties is
   already established.  This use case does not mean that the
   bidirectional "conversational" are switched to unidirectional
   "recorded" streams, but that "recorded" streams are to be added to
   the "conversational" streams.

3.2.4.  Allow access to personal/private video content

   In this scenario a user wants to remotely access personal content
   stored on a variety of media devices (watch at pre-recorded show from
   a mobile device at work).  While the streaming of the content and the
   trick plays will use established RTSP functionality the use of SIP
   locator services, strong authentication and authorization as well as
   presence make this solution more feasible.  For example, if the
   content is stored on a device located on a private network behind a
   FW/NAT, SIP via its name/location registration mecanism can be used
   to locate and connect to the device.  In addition for this use-case,
   the access to a video content should make "session mobility"
   possible.  In other words, when viewing a video content, it should be
   possible for the session of a user to seamlessly switch from one
   terminal (e.g.: mobile phone) to another one (e.g.: television).

3.2.5.  VOD services that requires resource or QOS-guarantees

   Consider a Video on Demand (stored video) service provided as a
   unicast session to an end user device from a server.  The user
   requests a VOD movie.  The VOD server determines the video that user
   wants to watch, and then contacts the appropriate network element
   (NE) and requests to reserve resources for the user and confirm back
   to the server.  The problem is here that until this point, the NE can
   not fully estimate and negotiate the media resources needed for the
   whole duration of the VOD.  SIP has pre-conditions that could be
   used; RTSP has no such functionality.

3.2.6.  Settlement across provider boundaries

   If a commercial VOD service is being offered by one party (e.g. a
   service provider) but receives carriage (transport) by one or more
   other parties (network providers) a mechanism is needed to allow



S. Whitehead, et al.     Expires April 25, 2007                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media            October 2006


   service signaling to exchange transaction identifiers for the purpose
   of charge correlation and settlements.  SIP (and its associated
   extensions) supports these capabilities.  RTSP at present does not.

3.2.7.  Intelligent selection of media encoding

   A user orders content to be delivered to its current device the
   content could exist in different format (e.g. standard definition or
   high definition) or encoding (MPEG2 or MPEG4 for example).  Media
   negociations may need to be informed by network transport
   capabilities.  This is based on knowledge of access-network type.


4.  Required capabilities/Derived Requirements

   This section lists key requirements derived from the application use
   cases described in the previous section.  The requirements are
   described in terms of the capabilities provided by a prospective
   solution.

4.1.  Scalability

   Any solution must be able to accommodate:
   o  Millions of clients and servers.
   o  An individual server may need to support thousands of parallel
      sessions.
   o  An individual client may need to support a number of simultaneous
      sessions.

4.2.  Signaling Latency

   Because the use cases refer to live content the latency budget is
   important for the user experience.  Thus, the solution must support
   the following requirements
   o  The session negotiation should complete in a few seconds at most
      (TBC: need confirmation).
   o  The media control operations should complete is less than a second
      (TBC: need confirmation).

4.3.  User identification, authentication and authorization

   In many targeted personal video streaming solution (including peer to
   peer) there is still a need for identifying source and destination,
   authenticate users and authorize access.

Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media            October 2006


4.4.  Accounting, charging, and settlements

   In the case of commercial applications billing aspects need to be
   addressed.  Billing aspects must also provide mechanisms to suppport
   charging correlation and settlements between one or more parties that
   collaborate to deliver the service.

4.5.  Server/client Location Discovery

   Location and discovery of the end point of a session is essential for
   personalization and targeted services.

4.6.  NAT and Firewall Traversal

   The solution must provide a way to traverse NATs and Firewalls.  For
   example, when switching from a remote monitoring communication to a
   conversational communication, the NATs bindings should not be
   renegotiated.

4.7.  Session-based transport policy control

   The signaling mechanism should provide a means to insure that
   sufficient network resources are available to deliver the service at
   the desired quality of experience.  In the event that sufficient
   resources are unavailable, the signaling mecanism should provide a
   means for denying the service request.

4.8.  Extensible with respect to application control signaling

   (Support many different application types)

   ...words to be added...

4.9.  Support media negotiation

   The solution must provide a way to negotiate all media sessions
   (e.g.: conversational and streaming) as a whole, as described in the
   RFC3264 with the offer/answer so that both parties can estimate the
   media resources involved in the session.

4.10.  Allow proxies

   Any solution to be deployed in a large network and provide adequate
   scalability should support proxies.  This also enables aggregation
   points for enhanced services.

Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media            October 2006


4.11.  Support media negotiation

   The signaling protocol should support the following capabilities with
   respect to negotiating media flows:
   o  Support for negotiating per-flow/media QoS and bandwidth
      requirements.
   o  Ability to add, delete, and modify media flows to a session.
   o  Ability to support both uni-directional an bi-directional flows in
      a single session.

4.12.  Support auto-configuration/installation

   The solution should enable per user and per device installation and
   configuration.  This may require device discovery and user
   authentication.

4.13.  Keeping DRM rights during a mobility session

   The signaling protocol should support the following capabilities with
   respect maintain DRM during session mobility:
   o  Support for negotiating per session and per device DRM.
   o  Ability to broker between different DRM models should the content
      require it.


5.  Exploring the Solution Space

   The set of use cases outlined above present a compelling argument for
   considering SIP for establishing "conversational video"
   communications or for those sessions that potentially become
   conversationsational at some point.  The use cases also show the need
   to keep established media controls.  This section reviews protocol
   features and analyses the use cases vis-a-vis the features.

5.1.  SIP Features

   SIP supports a rich set of capabilities that are useful in the
   context of streaming media applications.  In particular, SIP has the
   following properties that can be leveraged of in streaming sessions:
   o  Acts as a rendezvous protocol (with many capabilities).
   o  Carries the session description protocol.
   o  Supports invitation to unicast or multicast sessions.
   o  Supports SDP with the Offer/Answer Model.
   o  Works with NAT via ICE for SIP.
   o  Supports unidirectional and bidirectional communications e.g., can
      switch to 2-way or mix with streaming services.

Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media            October 2006


   o  Supports a set of P-headers useful in the context of commercial
      service settings, for example:
      *  Charging-ids : useful for 3rd party content providers.
      *  Access-network headers: useful for inferring proper content
         encoding.

5.2.  RTSP Features

   RTSP is widely used for controlling the playback of media flows such
   as the delivery of webcam monitoring content, the delivery of Video
   on Demand and the delivery of IPTV.  RTSP as defined in [3] has the
   following properties that are important to build on for any streming
   solution:
   o  Acts as a lightweight rendezvous protocol.
   o  Supports trick plays and media control (pause/rewind/forward/...).
   o  Carries and interprets the session description protocol.
   o  Supports invitation to unicast or multicast sessions.
   o  Is a recognized standard for streaming applications.

5.3.  Other Solutions

   Other protocols have been proposed to control media flows and
   resources recently the Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) [5].
   MRCP provides the requests, responses, and events needed to control
   the media processing resources.  Hence is ideal for voice sessions
   and eventually multimedia.  But MRCP relies on the Real Time RTSP to
   establish and maintain the session.  Hence the solution proposed by
   MRCP could eventually become complementary to a SIP/RTSP solution.

   ... more inputs required - to be completed ...

5.4.  Analysis

   There are obvious overlaps between SIP, MRCP and RTSP and there are
   standalone solutions that use one or the other.  The use cases as
   well as requirements of the previous sections do highlight the need
   for some form of collaboration between SIP and RTSP in particular.
   This is also reflected by the convergence in industry between
   essentially the telecommunications (where signaling SIP is dominant)
   and entertainment (where RTSP streaming is the favored solution).

   The use-cases clearly show that most of the time the choice is not
   SIP only or RTSP only or another protocol only but that the
   advantages of more integration between protocols lead to more robust
   solutions and a richer solution space.  The use cases also show that
   that the session setup negotiations are usually independent of the
   media controls.  Hence in many of the use cases SIP could be used to
   replace the RTSP SETUP and DESCRIBE methods, leaving RTSP to be used

Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media            October 2006


   for media control.

   There has already been work [6] on defining the integration.  This
   opens the way for new service development especially for
   entertainment.  Open issues remain however.  For example there is
   currently no consensus on whether the SETUP and DESCRIBE methods
   should be kept or not.  If the SETUP and DESCRIBE methods are not
   used, then the number of message round-trips is less important and
   the integration with an offer/answer mechanism is feasible.  This
   implementation is described in [6].  If the SETUP and DESCRIBE are
   still used, then no RTSP header field parameters need to be conveyed
   within the offer and answer and the integration with legacy RTSP
   servers may be easier and not require either further development or
   the use of gateways.

   It is also important to to note that other Standards Developing
   Organizations (SDOs) like the Alliance for Telecommunications
   Industry Solutions ATIS, the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB), the
   European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) TISPAN Next
   Generation Networks (NGN) CableLabs to name a few, have standardized
   streaming with RTSP and adopted SIP for offer/answer services.  RTSP
   has been widely adopted, has been proven successful and provides a
   good "running code and rough consensus" reason to keep it for media
   controls within SIP sessions.  This does not mean that this will not
   change in the future but gives an impetus for the current work to
   investigate the SIP/RTSP integration further.


6.  Recommendations

   We propose that further work be initiated to define further how to
   signal streaming media sessions using SIP based on the use cases
   defined in this document and the solution space identified.  We
   propose to reuse RTSP as a control stream negotiated by SIP/SDP as to
   keep compatibility with existing streaming solutions both in the
   entertainment and entreprise spaces.  This works has been already
   initialized in [6].


7.  IANA Considerations

   The RTSP 'encoding format' and the new media attributes may need to
   be registered.


8.  Security Considerations

   No rogue 3rd party should be allowed to get access to the SIP

   identity and use it to setup an un-authorized RTSP session.
