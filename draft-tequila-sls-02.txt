                 Abstract 
                   
                  This document  identifies the basic information to be handled by 
                  Service Level Specifications (SLS, [RFC 2475], [DS-TERMS]) when 
                  considering the deployment of value-added IP service offerings over 
                  the Internet. IP service offerings can be provided together with a 
                  given quality of service (QoS), whose definition can be conveyed in 
                  an SLS, from a technical standpoint. Since these IP services are 
                  likely to be provided over the whole Internet, their corresponding 
                  QoS will be based upon a set of technical parameters that both 
                  customers and network providers will have to agree upon. From this

                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                  perspective, this draft aims at listing (and promoting a standard 
                  formalism for) a set of basic parameters which will actually compose 
                  the elementary contents of an SLS. 
                   
                  Such a specification effort tries to address the following concerns: 
                   
                       - Provide a standard set of information to be negotiated 
                         between a customer and a network provider or between network 
                         providers; 
                   
                       - Provide the corresponding semantics of such information, so 
                         that it might be appropriately modeled and processed by the 
                         above-mentioned parties (in an automated fashion).

                 1.1 Changes w.r.t. the previous version 
                   
                  This is the fourth version of an Internet Draft on the issue of 
                  Service Level Specifications (SLSs). This version contains some 
                  editorial changes, some additions of parameters for identification 
                  and monitoring, new service scheduling parameters and an update of 
                  the section 4 entitled "Service Level Specifications and Per Domain 
                  Behaviors". This  section discusses the similarities and differences 
                  between SLSs and PDBs. Also some minor editing changes and reference 
                  updates have been incorporated in this version. 
                   
                   
                 1.2 Motivation 
                   
                  This document is presented to the IETF community to gauge the 
                  interest for advancing the work on the specification of an SLS 
                  definition, its semantics and its potential negotiation protocol(s). 
                  The deployment of QoS-based value-added IP services over the global 
                  Internet is one of the most exciting challenges that the network 
                  providers try to currently address, especially when considering the 
                  deployment of such service over administrative domains. From this 
                  standpoint, it seems useful to consider the specification of an SLS 
                  template these network providers would agree upon, so as e.g. to 
                  facilitate the enforcement of an inter-domain QoS policy.

                  Internet Draft    Service Level Specification        February 2002 
                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                 1.3 Objectives 
                   
                  This document presents an outline for the definition of the Service 
                  Level Specification parameters and the semantics that go behind this 
                  representation for a transport service. 
                   
                  The need to have such an agreed set of Service Level Specification 
                  parameters and semantics is manifold. 
                   
                  First, it is necessary to be able to allow for a highly developed 
                  level of automation and dynamic negotiation of Service Level 
                  Specifications between customers and network providers. Automation 
                  and dynamics are indeed helpful in providing customers (as well as 
                  providers) the technical means for the dynamic provisioning of 
                  quality of service configuration information. 
                   
                  Second, the design and the deployment of QoS-aware and capable 
                  Network and Element Management system in a multi-vendor environment 
                  requires a standardized set of semantics for Service Level 
                  Specifications being negotiated at different locations, such as: 
                   
                       - within an administrative domain (for intra-domain SLS 
                         negotiation purposes); 
                   
                       - between the customer and the network provider, where the 
                         customer might be e.g. a company, an application service 
                         provider (e.g. a voice over IP provider), another network 
                         provider, etc. 
                   
                       - between administrative domains (for inter-domain negotiation 
                         purposes). 
                   
                  While the representation and semantics behind a Service Level 
                  Specification need to be standardized, this document does not assume 
                  that the syntax, nor the SLS negotiation protocol need to be 
                  uniquely defined. The SLS negotiation protocol and associated 
                  requirements is out of scope of this document. 
                   
                  The document is structured as follows.  
                   
                  Section 2 lists the basic assumptions underlying this work and some 
                  terminology.  
                   
                  Section 3 describes the parameters of the Service Level 
                  Specification (template) for a transport service. This draft only 
                  describes the semantics of the SLS-parameters, omitting all 
                  implementation details as for instance the parameter data types (at 
                  this moment).  
                   
                  Section 4 provides some examples of relevant SLS specifications, 
                  with the aim to show the usage of the templates. The SLS formalism 
                  defined in section 3 allows making a distinction between qualitative 
                  and quantitative SLSs:

                       - SLSs depicting qualitative services should yield the 
                         specification of relative QoS indicators, such as a "low" IP 
                         packet loss. From this standpoint, best effort traffic is 
                         expected to be qualified by an SLS of that range of 
                         qualitative services. 
                   
                       - SLSs depicting quantitative services should yield the 
                         accurate measurement of QoS indicators, such as e.g., transit 
                         delay.  
                   
                  Sections 5 and 6 finally describe some SLS (protocol) negotiation 
                  requirements and security considerations respectively. 
                   
                  The material presented in this draft derives from work within the 
                  IST-TEQUILA project [TEQUILA]. 
                   
                   
                   
                 2  Basic assumption and terminology 
                   
                  The basic assumption of this draft is that IP services will be 
                  deployed over a public IP infrastructure, which will be (partly if 
                  not completely) composed of diffserv-aware network elements ([RFC-
                  2475], [DS-MODEL]). These network elements are able to implement Per

                  2597]), and the Expedited Forwarding PHB ([RFC-2598]. 
                   
                  In this document, the owner of the transport network equipment, i.e. 
                  the IP network, is called network provider. The network provider 
                  offers IP transport services to its customers. The IP transport 
                  services are technically described by SLSs. The customers of the 
                  network provider may be corporates, application service providers 
                  (themselves offering e.g. voice or video to residential users) or 
                  other network providers.  
                   
                  The terminology used in this draft is in agreement with the DiffServ 
                  Working Group terminology introduced in [RFC-2475], section 1.2 
                  "terminology" and further specified in [DS-TERMS]).

                  The following describes the attributes of the Service Level 
                  Specification. 
                   
                   
                 3.1 SLS Identification 
                   
                  The SLS Identification is a field used by the service provider and 
                  the customer to identify the SLS and the service the SLS is related 
                  to.

                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                   
                   
                  SLS Identification = (SLS Id, Service Id) 
                   
                       - SLS Id: This is the parameter identifying the SLS 
                        
                       - Service Id: This the parameter identifying the service the 
                         SLS is related to. 
                   
                  The SLS Identification is mainly dedicated to the classification of 
                  multiple SLSs that can composed a service. 
                   
                   
                 3.2 Scope 
                   
                  The scope of an SLS associated to a given service offering indicates 
                  where the Quality of Service (QoS) policy for that specific service 
                  offering is to be enforced. Therefore the scope uniquely identifies 
                  the geographical/topological region over which the QoS is to be 
                  enforced by indicating the boundaries of that region.  
                   
                  An SLS is associated with uni-directional traffic flows. Note 
                  however that this does not exclude the provisioning of bidirectional 
                  technical agreements, by combining one or more SLSs. 
                   
                  The associated scope of the SLS MUST be expressed by a couple of 
                  ingress and egress interfaces. Ingress/egress denote respectively 
                  the entry/exit points of the IP packets relative to the region 
                  (network).  
                   
                  Scope = (ingress, egress) with ingress/egress defined as 
                   
                       - Ingress: interface identifier | set of interface identifiers 
                         | any 
                        
                       - Egress : interface identifier | set of interface identifiers 
                         | any 
                   
                  Remarks: 
                   
                       - "|" denotes an exclusive OR. 
                        
                       - "any" is logically equivalent with unspecified. 
                   
                  The following combinations of (ingress, egress) interfaces are 
                  allowed:  
                   
                       - (1,1) -  one-to-one communication 
                        
                       - (1,N) - one-to-many communication (N>1) 
                        
                       - (1,any) - one-to-any communication

                  Internet Draft    Service Level Specification        February 2002 
                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                       - (N,1) - many-to-one communication (N>1) 
                        
                       - (any,1) - any-to-one communication 
                   
                  The above taxonomy excludes the many-to-many communication (M,N). 
                  Either ingress OR egress MUST be specified to exactly ONE interface 
                  identifier (with a non-exclusive OR). Many-to-many communication 
                  (M,N) can be decomposed into M times one-to-many communication 
                  (1,N).  
                   
                  This taxonomy SHOULD avoid all ambiguity about the IP flow (defined 
                  as a set of IP datagrams sharing at least one common characteristic, 
                  like e.g. the same [source address; destination address] pair), and 
                  its corresponding identification. (see section 3.2 and 3.3). If the 
                  ingress is a single interface identifier, then the traffic envelop 
                  and flow id concerns the incoming IP packet stream at the unique 
                  ingress point. If (only) the egress is a single interface, i.e. 
                  (N|any,1), then the traffic envelop and flow id concerns the 
                  outgoing (aggregate) traffic on the egress link. More details about 
                  the latter can be found in the example given in section 4.5.  
                   
                  In the remaining part of this document SLSs with an associated scope 
                  (topology) of (1,1) ; (1,N) ; (N,1) will be called respectively 
                  Pipe, Hose and Funnel SLSs. 
                   
                  Disclaimer: 
                   
                  An ingress (or egress) interface identifier should uniquely 
                  determine the boundary link as defined in [RFC-2475] on which 
                  packets arrive/depart at the border of a DS domain. This link 
                  identifier MAY be an IP address, but it may also be any other 
                  mutually agreed upon identifier which uniquely identifies a boundary 
                  link. For example a layer-two identifier in case of Ethernet or 
                  unnumbered PPP-based access  links in (Point-to-Point Protocol, 
                  [RFC-1661]). 
                   
                   
                 3.3 Flow Identification 
                   
                  The flow identification (Flow Id) of an SLS associated to a given 
                  service offering indicates for which IP packets the QoS policy for 
                  that specific service offering is to be enforced.  
                   
                  A Flow Id identifies a stream of IP datagrams sharing at least one 
                  common characteristic. An SLS contains one (and only one) Flow Id, 
                  which MAY formally be specified by providing one or more of the 
                  following attributes: 
                   
                  Flow Id = (Differentiated Services information, source information, 
                  destination information, application information) 
                   
                       - Differentiated Services information = DSCP value | set of 
                         DSCP values | any

                  Internet Draft    Service Level Specification        February 2002 
                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                        
                       The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) IP header field 
                         is defined in [RFC-2474]. 
                        
                       - Source information = source address | set of  source 
                         addresses | source prefixe | set of source prefixes | any 
                        
                       - Destination information = destination address | set of 
                         destination addresses | destination prefixe | set of 
                         destination prefixes | any 
                        
                       - Application information = protocol number | protocol number 
                         and source port, destination port | any 
                   
                  Note: "any" is again logically equivalent with unspecified. 
                   
                  Thus, the Flow Id may be expressed by information attributes related 
                  to the source/destination nodes, the application or the DS field in 
                  the IP header. The Flow Id provides the necessary information for 
                  classifying the packets at a DS boundary node.  
                   
                  This datagram classification can either reflect a Behaviour 
                  Aggregate (BA) or Multi-Field (MF)classification. 
                   
                  In case of MF-classification all attributes MAY be specified, 
                  including the DSCP field. MF classification may depict as well 
                  micro-flows as aggregate macro-flows, based on e.g. source network 
                  prefix [DS-MODEL]. Also the "set-of" semantics allows for the 
                  specification of aggregate flows. If a Flow Id is e.g. specified by 
                  a set of two IP source addresses, then any packet with either of the 
                  two concerned source addresses in its header belongs to the IP 
                  packet stream identified by Flow Id. 
                   
                  In case of BA-classification [RFC-2475], the DSCP attribute MUST be 
                  specified and the other attributes MUST NOT be specified. If a set 
                  of DSCP-values is specified, then any packet having a DSCP belonging 
                  to this set is part of the Flow Id packet stream. As an example 
                  consider an Ordered Aggregate (OA) IP packet stream of a particular 
                  Assured Forwarding Class AFx (AF1,AF2,AF3,AF4 - see [RFC 2597]). 
                  This stream could be specified within one Flow Id using three DSCP-
                  values, indicating the three drop precedences levels. 
                   
                  It should however be noticed that the DSCP-value(s) specified in the 
                  SLS has (have) as such nothing to do with the DSCP-marking of 
                  packets inside the DiffServ network. The latter, i.e. the "interior" 
                  DSCP is used for differentiating packets according to Per Hop 
                  Behaviours (PHBs). The former, i.e. the "ingress" DSCP value 
                  (specified in the SLS), is just another way of identifying a packet 
                  stream, eventually in combination with other IP header fields. At 
                  the ingress DiffServ node (incoming) packets are classified based on 
                  the "ingress" DSCP value (amongst others), after which they may be 
                  re-marked by the "interior" DSCP-value.  
                   
                    
                  TEQUILA Consortium   Expires August - 2002                [Page 8]

                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                  Finally note also that the IP routing scheme MAY put restrictions on 
                  combining scope and flow identification within an SLS.  
                   
                  In general, if (only) Flow ID is specified by source and destination 
                  IP address (IP-src, IP-dest), and the scope is unspecified, then 
                  there is no a-priori assumption about the actual ingress/egress 
                  points that this traffic will cross. Indeed, it is the 
                  responsibility of the network provider to define the most 
                  appropriate route for this traffic, by enforcing the corresponding 
                  traffic engineering and routing policies. Thus, the (ingress, 
                  egress) information (which in this case is NOT part of the SLS 
                  template instance) is then derived from the Flow Id and the routing 
                  policy of the network provider. 
                   
                  On the other hand, if both Flow Id AND scope are specfied in the 
                  SLS, resp. by the pairs (IP-src, IP-dest) and (IP-ingr, IP-egr) 
                  pairs then it is clear that the IP packets MUST follow the route 
                  (IP-src,...,IP-ingr,...,IP-egr,...,IP-dest). Thus the restriction is 
                  that the scope (IP-ingr, IP-egr) is part of the route from IP-scr to 
                  IP-dest.  
                   
                  Also remark that the exclusion of the many-to-many communication 
                  scope model puts similar constraints on the source/destination 
                  fields of the Flow Identification. 
                   
                   
                 3.4 Traffic Envelop and Traffic Conformance 
                   
                  The traffic envelop describes the traffic (conformance) 
                  characteristics of the IP packet stream identified by the Flow Id. 
                  The traffic envelop is a set of Traffic Conformance Parameters, 
                  describing how the packet stream should look like to get the 
                  guarantees indicated by the performance parameters (defined in 
                  section 3.5) 
                   
                  The Traffic Conformance Parameters are the basic input for the 
                  Traffic Conformance Algorithm. Traffic Conformance Testing is the 
                  combination of the Traffic Conformance Parameters and the Traffic 
                  Conformance Algorithm. This will usually be done at a DS-boundary 
                  node. 
                   
                  The algorithm and the conformance test can be binary-based or multi-
                  level based.  
                   
                  Binary Traffic Conformance Testing is a set of actions which 
                  uniquely identifies the "in-profile" and "out-of profile" (or 
                  excess) packets of an IP stream (identified by Flow-Id). In this 
                  case the Traffic Conformance Parameters describe the reference 
                  values the traffic (identified by the Flow ID.) will have to comply 
                  with, thus yielding the notions of "in" and "out" of profile 
                  traffics. The Traffic Conformance Algorithm is the mechanism 
                  enabling unambiguously to identify all "in" or "out" of profile 
                  packets based on these Conformance parameters.

                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                   
                  In case of multi-level (n) Traffic Conformance Testing a packet will 
                  be tagged (by the algorithm) as belonging to a particular level 
                  (1...n). Packets tagged as level n are called "excess" packets.  
                   
                  The SLS MUST indicate the concerned level (n) of the conformance 
                  testing algorithm: 
                   
                       - Multi-level conformance testing n (integer) 
                   
                  The following gives a (non-exhaustive) list of potential conformance 
                  parameters.  
                   
                       - Peak rate p (bits per second) 
                        
                       - Token bucket rate r (bits per second) 
                        
                       - Bucket depth b (bytes) 
                        
                       - Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) M (bytes) 
                        
                       - Minimum packet size (bytes) 
                   
                  Binary-based Traffic Conformance Testing examples: 
                   
                       - Conformance parameters = token bucket parameters (b,r); 
                         conformance algorithm = token bucket algorithm.  
                        
                       - Conformance parameters = token bucket parameters and peak 
                         rate (b,r,p) with p larger than r; conformance algorithm = 
                         the combined token bucket (b,r) and (b,p). This is the 
                         conformance test for Integrated Services Controlled Load and 
                         Guaranteed Service IP flows in the IntSer QoS architecture 
                         [RFC-2211, RFC-2212]. The scheme permits bursty traffic to be 
                         sent, limited to a burst of b bytes, with a (long-term) 
                         average rate of r and a peak rate of no more than p.  
                        
                       - Conformance parameters = MTU; conformance algorithm = all 
                         packets allowed with size smaller than MTU; packets larger 
                         than MTU are fragmented or dropped.

                       - The Two-rate Three-colour marker is based on two token 
                         buckets with rates r1 and r2 (r2 being greater than r1), 
                         containing respectively green and yellow tokens. The simplest 
                         operational mode is the "colour-blank" mode. A packet is 
                         tagged "green" if there are green and yellow tokens 
                         available, yellow if only yellow tokens are available and 
                         otherwise it is tagged red.

                 3.5 Excess Treatment 
                   
                  This section describes how the network provider will process excess 
                  traffic, i.e. out-of-profile traffic (in case of binary conformance 
                  testing) or n-level traffic (in case of n-level conformance 
                  testing). The process takes place after Traffic Conformance Testing, 
                  described previously. 
                   
                  Excess traffic may be dropped, shaped and/or remarked. The SLS MUST 
                  specify the appropriate action by the following attribute. 
                   
                       - Excess Treatment 
                   
                  If Excess Treatment is not indicated, then excess traffic is 
                  dropped. Depending on the appropriate action, more parameters MAY be 
                  required The following is an indication in case of binary 
                  conformance testing. Multi-level conformance testing (like the 
                  definition of a hierarchical drop preference model) MAY also be 
                  enforced, but this concern has been left for further study. 
                   
                       - If excess traffic is dropped, then all packets marked as 
                         "out-of-profile" by the Traffic Conformance Algorithm are 
                         dropped. No extra parameters are needed. 
                        
                       - If excess traffic is shaped, then all packets marked as "out-
                         of-profile" by the Traffic Conformance Algorithm are delayed 
                         until they are "in-profile". The shaping rate is the 
                         policing/token bucket rate r. The extra parameter is the 
                         buffer size of the shaper. 
                        
                       - If excess traffic is marked or remarked, then all packets 
                         marked as "out-of-profile" by the the Traffic Conformance 
                         Algorithm are (re-) marked with a particular DSCP-value 
                         (yellow or red). The extra parameter is the DSCP.  
                   
                   
                 3.6 Performance Guarantees 
                   
                  The performance parameters describe the service guarantees the 
                  network offers to the customer for the packet stream described by 
                  the Flow Id and within the limits of the geographical/topological 
                  extent given by the scope.  
                   
                  There are four performance parameters:  
                   
                       - one-way transit delay, optional quantile  
                        
                       - packet delay variation or jitter, optional quantile 
                        
                       - packet loss 
                        
                       - throughput

                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                  Delay, jitter and packet loss guarantees are for the in-profile 
                  traffic in case of binary conformance testing. For multi-level (n) 
                  conformance testing, delay, jitter and loss guarantees MAY be 
                  specified for each conformance level-i, except the last one (n). For 
                  example if n = 3, one can have a delay guarantee for the 
                  "conformance level-1" packets and a different delay guarantee for 
                  the "conformance level-2" packets. No guarantees are given for 
                  excess ("conformance level-n") traffic.  
                   
                  The throughput is an overall guarantee for the IP packet stream, 
                  independent of a particular level (see below). 
                   
                  The following definitions always consider the (measurable) 
                  performance parameters related to the packet stream specified by the 
                  Flow Id. For simplicity the definitions below are given for binary 
                  conformance testing (n=2), but generalisation is straightforward. 
                   
                  The delay and jitter indicate respectively the maximum packet 
                  transfer delay and packet transfer delay variation from ingress to 
                  egress. 
                   
                  Delay and jitter may either be specified as worst case 
                  (deterministic) bounds or as quantiles. Indeed, the worst case 
                  delay/jitter bounds will be very rare events and customers may find 
                  measurements of e.g. 99.5th percentile a more relevant empirical 
                  gauge of delay/jitter.  
                   
                  Suppose e.g. that the SLS specifies the triple (delay = 10ms, 
                  quantile = 10E-3). Then the probability that the transfer delay of a 
                  packet (between ingress-egress) is larger than 10ms, is less than 
                  10E-3. 
                   
                  The above syntax for delay/jitter can be generalised by specifying 
                  in the SLS an array of e.g. N (delay/jitter, quantile)-couples. The 
                  more couples, the better the delay probability tail distribution can 
                  be approximated. Such a specification together with the eventual 
                  need of such a generalisation is for further study.   
                   
                  The packet loss probability is ratio of the lost (in-profile) 
                  packets between ingress and egress and the offered (in-profile) 
                  packets at ingress.  
                   
                                lost packets between (& including) ingress and egress 
                  packet loss = ------------------------------------------------------ 
                                      offered (injected) packets at ingress  
                   
                  The throughput is the rate measured at egress counting all packets 
                  identified by Flow Id. Notice that all packets, independently of 
                  their conformance level (in/out-of-profile) contribute. Indeed, if 
                  the customer (only) wants a throughput guarantee, then he/she does 
                  not care whether in- or out-profile packets are dropped, but is only 
                  interested in the overall throughput of its packet stream.

                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                  Note on the relation with the Traffic Conformance Parameters 
                  (section 3.3) in case of a binary-based conformance testing 
                  algorithm:  
                   
                       - The Traffic Conformance Algorithm (and parameters) MUST be 
                         specified when guaranteeing delay/jitter or packet loss, i.e. 
                         if one of these performance parameters is quantified in the 
                         SLS. Conformance testing is required because the delay/jitter 
                         and loss guarantees are only for the stream of in-profile 
                         packets. 
                        
                       - When only guaranteeing a throughput, or if non-of the other 
                         performance parameters is quantified, the traffic conformance 
                         algorithm MAY be specified. It is not required to specify the 
                         Conformance Algorithm, because the (eventual) throughput 
                         guarantee does not require the strict distinction between 
                         in/out-of-profile traffic. However, the network operator will 
                         probably protect his network by implementing a Traffic 
                         Conditioner at Ingress and specifying the token policing rate 
                         (r) (almost) equal to the throughput guarantee R, r~R.  He 
                         may or may not tag/mark excess traffic, according to his own 
                         - internal - policy rules. See also example 4.2. 
                   
                  Note on the relation between throughput R, packet loss p and excess 
                  treatment in case of a binary-based conformance testing algorithm:  
                   
                       - First consider the case where excess traffic is dropped (or 
                         shaped to in-profile) based on the token bucket (b,r) traffic 
                         conformance algorithm. As only in-profile packets are allowed 
                         at ingress, the following equality holds: 
                        
                               throughput R = (1-p) * token rate r 
                   
                       Thus the throughput guarantee can be derived from the loss 
                       probability and token rate and is therefore not an independent 
                       parameter. 
                   
                       - If excess traffic is allowed (and marked accordingly), then 
                         "throughput" is an independent parameter because it also 
                         takes into account the out-of-profile packets (measured at 
                         egress). One has obviously the inequality:  
                        
                               throughput R >= (1-p) * token rate r 
                   
                   
                  Quantitative performance guarantees 
                   
                  A performance parameter is said to be quantified if its value is 
                  specified to a numeric (quantitative) value. 
                   
                  The service guarantee offered by the SLS is said to be quantitative 
                  IF at least one of the 4 performance parameters is quantified.

                  Qualitative performance guarantees 
                   
                  If non of the SLS performance parameters are quantified, then the 
                  performance parameters "delay" and "packet loss" MAY be "qualified". 
                   
                  Possible qualitative values (for delay and/or loss): high, medium, 
                  low. 
                   
                  Relative delay guarantees:  
                   
                       - gold service : value = low 
                        
                       - silver service : value = medium 
                        
                       - bronze service : value = high or not indicated 
                   
                  Relative loss guarantees 
                   
                       - green service : value = low 
                        
                       - yellow service : value = medium 
                        
                       - red service : value = high or not indicated 
                   
                  The quantification of relative difference between <high/medium/low> 
                  is a matter of provider's policy (e.g. high = 2 x  medium ; medium = 
                  2 x low). 
                   
                  The above taxonomy yields the following combinations of qualitative 
                  services (Table 1).

                 3.7 Service schedule 
                   
                  The service schedule indicates the start and the end of the service, 
                  i.e. when the service is available. 
                   
                  The Service schedule MAY be specified with the following parameters: 
                   
                  Service schedule = (Start date, End date, MonthMask, DayMask, 
                  TimeMask) 
                   
                       - Start date: Date and hour from which the service becomes 
                         available. 
                        
                       - End date: Date and hour from which the service becomes 
                         unavailable. 
                   
                  Start date and End date MUST be specified and End date MUST be 
                  greater than End date. 
                   
                  Remark: service schedule "from now on" [now, infinity] can be 
                  captured by putting the above to their full range. 
                   
                       - MonthMask: Month of the year range | set of Month of the year 
                         range 
                   
                       - DayMask: Day of the month range | set of Day of the month 
                         range 
                        
                       - TimeMask: Time of the day range | set of Time of the day 
                         range 
                        
                   
                  An SLS is active between the Start date and the End date. MonthMask, 
                  DayMask and TimeMask MAY be specified to refine the periods of 
                  activation of the SLS. 
                   
                  MonthMask, DayMask and TimeMask respectively identify the months of 
                  the year, the days of the month and the time of the day in which the 
                  SLS is valid. 
                   
                  For example, to define an SLS from the 01/01/02 at 0:00AM to 
                  12/31/05 at 11:59PM, in January, March, and from June to November, 
                  only the second half of these months, from 2:00AM to 7:00AM and from 
                  8:00PM to 11:00PM, the Service schedule is specified as follow: 
                   
                       - Start date: (01012002, 00:00:00AM) 
                        
                       - End Date: (12312005, 11:59:59PM) 
                        
                       - MonthMask: (01, 03, [06 11]) 
                        
                       - DayMask: ([15 31]

                       - TimeMask: ([02:00:00AM 07:00:00AM], [08:00:00PM 11:00:00PM]) 
                   
                   
                   
                 3.8 Reliability 
                   
                  Reliability indicates the maximum allowed mean downtime per year 
                  (MDT) and the maximum allowed time to repair (TTR) in case of 
                  service breakdown (e.g. in case of cable cut). 
                   
                  The Mean Down Time might be expressed in minutes per year and the 
                  Maximum Time To Repair might be expressed in seconds. 
                   
                   
                 3.9 Monitoring 
                   
                  The monitoring indicates the QoS parameters that have to be 
                  monitored and reported. They will be applied on the set of 
                  interfaces defined in the Scope block of the SLS Template. 
                   
                  The monitoring part is composed of the following parameters: 
                   
                       - Delay Measurement Period: Describes the period for measuring 
                         the delay. 
                   
                       - Delay Reporting: Indicates when the delay measurement reports 
                         have to be sent to the customer. 
                   
                       - Delay Notification Threshold: Indicates a delay threshold 
                         that triggers a notification to the customer if the threshold 
                         is reached. 
                   
                       - Jitter Measurement Period: Describes the period for measuring 
                         the jitter. 
                   
                       - Jitter Reporting: Indicates when the jitter measurement 
                         reports have to be sent to the customer. 
                   
                       - Jitter Notification Threshold: Indicates a jitter threshold 
                         that triggers a notification to the customer if the threshold 
                         is reached. 
                   
                       - Packet Loss Measurement Period: Describes the period for 
                         measuring the packet loss. 
                   
                       - Packet Loss Reporting: Indicates when the packet loss 
                         measurement reports have to be sent to the customer. 
                   
                       - Packet Loss Notification Threshold: Indicates a packet loss 
                         threshold that triggers a notification to the customer if the 
                         threshold is reached.

                       - Throughput Measurement Period: Describes the period for 
                         measuring the throughput. 
                   
                       - Throughput Reporting: Indicates when the packet loss 
                         measurement reports have to be sent to the customer. 
                   
                       - Throughput Notification Threshold: Indicates a throughput 
                         threshold that triggers a notification to the customer if the 
                         threshold is reached. 
                   
                       - Maximum outage time: Indicates the duration of outage that is 
                         allowed for any interfaces described in the Scope. If the 
                         value overtakes the threshold, the provider sends a 
                         notification describing this event to the customer. 
                   
                       - Maximum bandwidth: Indicates the maximum bandwidth that can 
                         be used on any interface described in the Scope. If the value 
                         overtakes the threshold, the provider sends a notification 
                         describing this event to the customer. Maximum Bandwidth 
                         utilization reflects the maximum bandwidth usage that is set 
                         on each interfaces. It indicates a percentage of the capacity 
                         bandwidth of the interface (if speed SNMP variable). 
                   
                       - Total number of outage: Indicates for each interface 
                         described in the Scope the maximum number of outage 
                         authorized. If the value overtakes the threshold, the 
                         provider sends a notification describing this event to the 
                         customer 
                   
                       - Reporting Document Type: Describes which kind of documents 
                         have to be sent to the customer (word, excel, HTML, etc.). 
                   
                       - Reporting Destination Address: Indicates where the provider 
                         has to send the reports (email, postal, fax, etc.).

                 4  Service Level Specifications and Per Domain Behaviours 
                   
                  Recently the IETF DiffServ working group has documented in an 
                  informational RFC [RFC 3086] the concept of DiffServ Per Domain 
                  Behaviours (PDBs). Although this [RFC 3086] clearly specifies the 
                  difference between PDBs and SLSs, it is worthwile to further 
                  elaborate communalities and differences between PDBs and SLSs.  
                   
                  We first recall the DiffServ working group terminology.

                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                   
                 4.1 DiffServ Terminology 
                   
                 4.1.1 About Service Level Specifications 
                   
                  According to the IETF DiffServ working group, a Service Level 
                  Agreement (SLA) is "the documented result of a negotiation between a 
                  customer and a provider of an IP service that specifies the levels 
                  of availability, serviceability, performance, operation or other 
                  attributes of the transport service" [DS-TERMS].  
                   
                  The SLA contains technical and non-technical terms and conditions. 
                  The technical specification of the IP connectivity service is given 
                  in Service Level Specifications (SLSs). An SLS "is a set of 
                  technical parameters and their values, which together define the 
                  service, offered to a traffic stream by a DiffServ domain". SLSs 
                  describe the traffic characteristics of IP flows and the QoS 
                  guarantees offered by the network to these flows.  
                   
                 4.1.2 About Per Domain Behaviors 
                   
                  In [RFC 3086] a "Per Domain Behavior is the expected treatment that 
                  an identifiable or target group of packets will receive from "edge-
                  to-edge" of a DS domain. A particular PHB (or, if applicable, list 
                  of PHBs) and traffic conditioning requirements are associated with 
                  each PDB". 
                   
                  "A PDB is characterized by specific metrics that quantify the 
                  treatment a set of packets with a particular DSCP (or set of DSCPs) 
                  will receive as it crosses a DS domain" 
                   
                 4.1.3 About SLS and PDB relationships 
                   
                  [RFC 3086] clearly states that "there is a clear distinction between 
                  the definition of a Per-Domain Behavior in a DS domain and a service 
                  that might be specified in a Service Level Agreement. The PDB 
                  definition is a technical building block...in configuring DS 
                  domains, but the PDB (or PDBs) used by a provider is not expected to 
                  be visible to customers any more than the specific PHBs employed in 
                  the provider's network would be." 
                   
                  However, "the measurable parameters of a PDB should be suitable for 
                  use in Service Level Specifications at the network edge."  
                   
                  Vice versa, SLSs are "expected to include specific values or bounds 
                  for PDB parametersd."  
                   
                  Therefore SLSs and PDBs are different concepts but there is clearly 
                  a relationship between both. We now further elaborate on this 
                  relationship.

                 4.2 SLS and PDB similarities and differences. 
                   
                 4.2.1 A subset of common parameters 
                   
                  Both an SLS and a PDB try to capture the technical "terms and 
                  conditions" for describing the behavior of an (aggregate) packet 
                  stream crossing a (DiffServ) domain. Roughly speaking, if the 
                  incoming packet stream behaves appropriately, then the network will 
                  treat the packet stream as can be expected (from the SLS or the 
                  PDB).  
                   
                  Within the context of this draft, the incoming packet stream is 
                  identified by a "Flow Identifier", which may be mapped accordingly 
                  on PDB classifiers and packet filters. "Behaving appropriately" 
                  means that the packet stream should be conformant with the Traffic 
                  Envelop (section 3.3). As in a PDB, excess packets are subject to a 
                  Traffic Conditioner which may mark, drop or shape these packets.  
                   
                  The resulting packet stream, called the foo traffic aggregate in 
                  [RFC 3086] is conditioned such that it may expect reasonable 
                  treatment in the DS domain. In the context of this draft, the foo 
                  traffic aggregate is the "in-profile" stream and should get the QoS 
                  performance guarantees as defined in section 3.5.  
                   
                  Clearly [RFC 3086] states correctly that (some) paparameters of SLSs 
                  should be mapped on PDB characteristics and that (some) PDB 
                  parameters should be suitable for SLSs. Obviously the definition of 
                  specific PDBs and those of SLS template(s) should be correlated.  
                   
                 4.2.2 External interfaces versus intra-domain QoS building blocks 
                   
                  Although SLSs and PDBs may have a common parameter subset, the 
                  concepts themselves are substantially different.  
                   
                  In summary, an SLS and PDB differ along the following lines: 
                   
                       - An SLS is an external interface between two legal entities, 
                         i.e. a customer and a provider. A PDB is a technical intra-
                         domain QoS building block. 
                   
                       - An SLS should be (QoS) technology independent while a PDB is 
                         clearly a DiffServ concept. For example, as mentioned in [RFC 
                         3086], it should be possible to offer "premium IP services" 
                         over a Best-Effort network by  over-provisioning the network 
                         resources. Thus delay-sensitive services must not necessarily 
                         be mapped on a PDB like a "Virtual Wire", but as in the 
                         example above, the service may simply use a best-effort 
                         "PDB". There is no one to one mapping; the mapping will be 
                         determined by the provider policy. (Analogously the mapping 
                         of PDB to PHB is not one-to-one neither). 
                   
                       - An SLS is itself a (service) building bilding block for 
                         constructing (complex) IP transport services. For example, a

                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                         bi-directional Virtual Leased Line has two SLSs. Multi-edge 
                         VPNs may be very complex and require multiple SLSs. In 
                         general, an {SLS}-set is needed for describing the technical 
                         (QoS & traffic-related) characteristics of an IP transport 
                         service. 
                   
                       - Finally, an SLS and a PDB also have some distinct parameters. 
                         For example, the scope and the service schedule of an SLS 
                         specify respectively where (the geographical region) and when 
                         this typical service is applicable. It is unlikely that a 
                         PDB, as a generic service independent building block, will 
                         specify such parameters.  
                   
                   
                 4.3 From PHB to value-added IP services: a layered DiffServ view 
                   
                  We end this PDB-SLS discussion by a high-level view on a possible 
                  layered ("object") model for describing and enabling value-added IP 
                  services over DiffServ networks.

                  Each of the underlying "layers" or "objects" exposes its (QoS) 
                  capabilities to the upper layer. Conversely, an upper-layer object 
                  makes use of the lower-layer capabilities and therefore should be 
                  mapped onto the lower layer objects.

                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                  According to [RFC 3086] the specification of a PDB type should 
                  e.g.include the (lower-layer) PHB or PHB-group on which the PDB is 
                  build.  
                   
                  On the othe hand, the mapping of SLSs to PDBs (and therefore PHBs) 
                  is a rather unexplored area. For example, it is clear that an SLS is 
                  service and customer specific; and is part of the service management 
                  system of the provider. A PDB is customer agnostic and could be a 
                  prefered object for (longer-term) traffic engineering and resource 
                  management.  
                   
                  Clearly the mapping from SLS to PDB involves an aggregation policy 
                  of the provider, i.e. mapping of customer aware objects to non-
                  custome aware entities. This is a non-straightforward problem. It 
                  may be very much determined by the provider policy, but some general 
                  "service mapping" and "customer aggregation" guidelines should be 
                  very useful.  
                   
                  This is for further study.

                  Within this section several instantiations of SLSs are presented to 
                  illustrate the potential use of the SLS template defined above. 
                   
                   
                 5.1 Virtual Leased Line  
                   
                  The following specifies the SLS for a (uni-directional) VLL with 
                  quantified throughput guarantee of 1 Mbps, a delay guarantee of 20 
                  ms for a 10E-3 quantile and zero packet loss. 
                   
                       - Scope: one-to-one communication (Ingress, Egress) specified 
                   
                       - Flow identification: (source,destination) IP-addresses, 
                         DSCP=EF. 
                   
                       - Traffic Conditioning: token bucket (b,r), r = 1 Mbps 
                   
                       - Excess Treatment = dropping. Thus only in-profile packets are 
                         allowed. 
                   
                       - Delay guarantee = (d = 20 ms, t = 5 minutes, q = 10E-3) 
                   
                       - Loss guarantee p = 0 (imlying a throughput guarantee R = r)  
                   
                       - Service Schedule: may be indicated 
                   
                       - Reliability: may be indicated

                                      Semantics and Parameters 
                   
                  Notice that in this example, the throughput guarantee is a derived 
                  parameter from the packet loss p=0, the the conditioning token 
                  bucket parameter r=1 Mbps and the excess treatment=dropping. 
                   
                   
                 5.2 Bandwidth Pipe for data-services 
                   
                  The following SLS specifies a bandwidth pipe with a strict 
                  throughput guarantee, but with only a loose requirements for packet 
                  loss, i.e. "low". Thus, the SLS only mentions the scope (pipe), the 
                  Flow Id and a throughput guarantee. Remark that there are now 
                  traffic conformance parameters (and consequently no excess treatment 
                  indication).  
                   
                       - Scope: one-to-one communication (Ingress, Egress) specified 
                        
                       - Flow identification: (source,destination) IP-addresses 
                        
                       - Throughput guarantee R = 1 Mbps 
                        
                       - Service Schedule: may be indicated 
                        
                       - Reliability: may be indicated 
                   
                  Although there is no (explicit) traffic conditioning agreement 
                  between the customer and the network operator (i.e. such parameters 
                  are not mentioned in the SLS), the operator is likely to protect his 
                  network by implementing a traffic conditioner token bucket (b,r). If 
                  the operator can guarantee a zero packet loss for the bandwidth 
                  pipe, then the token rate equals the throughput guarantee. However, 
                  the SLS can also be met by the operator without such a stringent 
                  loss requirement, say p = 10E-5. In this case the token rate is 
                  derived from the throughput guarantee and the loss probability: 
                   
                       token rate r = R / (1-p) 
                   
                  The in-profile packet stream (according to the conditioner (b,r)) 
                  has a throughput guarantee of R = r * (1-p) = 1 Mbps. 
                   
                  Further, it is up to the operator's policy whether or not excess 
                  traffic (again according to the operator's conditioner (b,r), which 
                  is not mentioned in the SLS agreement) is allowed or not in his 
                  network. 
                   
                   
                 5.3 Minimum rate guarantee with allowed excess 
                   
                  The following SLS could be applied for bulk FTP traffic that 
                  requires a minimum throughput, but would take everything it can get 
                  (TCP). Also adaptive applications, like video streaming, that 
                  however require a minimum throughput for the service.

                       - Excess Treatment: Remarking MUST be indicated (excess is 
                         given a higher drop precedence) 
                        
                       - Performance guarantees: guaranteed throughput R = r.

                  The following SLS is meant for the Olympic Service. It could be used 
                  for differentiating applications such as web-browsing and e-mail 
                  traffic.

                         treatment will be applied. 
                   
                       - Excess Treatment: remarking.

                 5.5 The Funnel service 
                   
                  The service offered by the funnel model is primarily a protection 
                  service: the customer wants to set a maximum on the amount of 
                  traffic (characterized by a DSCP) entering his network. It could 
                  e.g. be used for business customers to restrict the amount of web 
                  browsing traffic entering their network.

                              Figure 2: Funnel model 
                   
                  In [Figure 2], the customer A requires that the traffic entering his 
                  network from B,C and D does not exceed the rate a_out.  
                   
                       - Scope: Funnel (N|all,1). 
                   
                       - Flow identification: DSCP MUST be indicated. The filter (see 
                         below) is applied to all traffic characterized by the DSCP -
                         value. 
                   
                       - Traffic Conformance Parameters: (b, r) MUST be indicated. The 
                         token bucket parameters indicate the maximum allowed 
                         throughput (r = a_out) towards the customer network on the 
                         specified egress interface. This maximum or filter is applied 
                         to all packets marked with the DSCP-value indicated above.  
                   
                       - Excess treatment: dropping (this is actually the service 
                         offered by the network). 
                   
                       - Performance Parameter: not specified.

                       - Traffic Conformance Parameters: if not indicated, then the 
                         full link capacity is allowed 
                   
                       - Excess Treatment: not specified 
                   
                       - Performance Parameters: none 
                   
                       - Service Schedule: may be indicated. 
                   
                       - Reliability: may be indicated.

                  of the quality associated to the service it has subscribed to may 
                  require the activation of security features so that:

                         needs to be performed; 
                   
                       - Identification and authentication of the peering entities 
                         which will participate in the SLS negotiation process needs 
                         to be performed; 
                   
                       - Preservation of the confidentiality of the information to be 
                         conveyed during the SLS negotiation and instantiation 
                         procedures between the peering entities is a MUST.
