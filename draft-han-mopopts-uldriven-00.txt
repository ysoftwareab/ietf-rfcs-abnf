1. Introduction 
    
   Protocol layering is a common technique to simplify networking design 
   by dividing it into functional layers, and assigning protocols to 
   perform each layer's stack. Protocol layering produces simple 
   protocols, each with a few well-defined tasks. These protocols can 
   then be assembled into a useful whole. However, keeping the strict 
   layering all the time may result in inefficient implementation of a 
   protocol suite. 
    
   In IEEE and IETF, various proposals have been made for utilizing 
   link-layer indication to optimize configuration of Internet layer and 
   have an effect on Transport or Application layer. Particularly, it 
   becomes popular to utilize link-layer indication to expedite Internet 
   layer handover. For example, [1] defines the generic triggers, 
   including "Link Up", "Link Down", "Link Going Down", "Link Going Up", 
   "Link Quality Crosses Threshold", "Trigger Rollback", and "Better 
   Signal Quality AP Available". [2] provides a catalogue of existing 
   "Link Up" and "Link Down" triggers from well-known link-layer 
   technologies, such as GPRS, 3GPP2, and WLAN. 
    
   From upper layer perspective, link-layer indication is "advisory." It 
   is expected upper layer protocols register a kind of callback 
   function into link-layer, and passively just hear events come from 
   link layer. In some cases, however, it is necessary for upper layer 
   to actively request link layer to take an action, such as disconnect 
   from or connect to a radio link.  
    
   This document describes scenarios where upper layer-driven link layer 
   actions are necessary. A set of primitives is proposed for these 
   interactions between the upper layers and the link layer. The 
   precedent work of this document is one of our contributions to IEEE 
   802.21 [3]. 
    
2. Scenario 
    
   2.1 Notifying Exact Time of Link Switch (in FMIPv6) 
    
   FMIPv6 (Fast Handover for Mobile IPv6) [4] describes a protocol to 
   replace MIPv6 (Mobile IPv6) [5] movement detection algorithm and new 
   CoA configuration procedure. It also specifies a bi-directional 
   tunnel establishment typically between previous CoA and new CoA so 
   that the MN can continue to receive or send packets while it 
   completes the binding update to HA and CNs on the new subnet. If 
   possible, this tunnel establishment and the commencement of packet 
   tunneling should be done before MN attaches to new link. Otherwise, 
   they should be achieved immediately after MN attaches to new link.

                 Upper Layer-driven Link Layer Action        July 2004 
 
 
   According to FMIPv6 specification, the scenario in which an MN 
   receives an acknowledgement of the fast binding update in the current 
   link is called 'predictive' mode of operation. The scenario in which 
   an MN does not receive such acknowledgement in the current link is 
   called 'reactive' mode of operation. In the latter case, MN cannot 
   ascertain whether the fast binding update has been successfully 
   processed. Hence, MN should (re)send the fast binding update, which 
   is encapsulated in fast neighbor advertisement message, as soon as it 
   attaches to new attachment point. This procedure will cause wireless 
   resources to be more used and an additional processing at new access 
   router is required to check whether or not the new CoA is already 
   confirmed (or whether or not the new CoA is already used by other 
   node). This fact implies that the 'predictive' mode is more effective 
   than 'reactive' mode, and it is highly recommended that MN should 
   receive the acknowledgement in the current link. Current FMIPv6 
   specifies MN should send FBU_RETRIES fast binding updates in case 
   that it does not receive the acknowledgement still when attaching to 
   the current link.  
    
   It is noted that the acknowledgement received by MN in the current 
   link indicates that packet tunneling would already commence. Hence, 
   MN SHOULD switch its connectivity into the new attachment point 
   immediately after receiving the acknowledgement. Otherwise, there is 
   no way for MN to receive the tunneled packets unless the previous 
   access router (the sender of tunneled packet) also begins to copy the 
   incoming packets and forward them to previous CoA on its link. But, 
   such transmission of two packet copies can impose much load on both 
   wired and wireless network.  
    
   If the signal strength with current attachment point becomes weaker 
   than a predefined value of signal strength, MN SHOULD switch its 
   connectivity into the new attachment point without concerns about 
   receiving acknowledgement.  
    
   After sending the fast binding update, if MN could still communicate 
   without the abrupt deterioration of signal strength, the optimal way 
   to achieve seamless handover without much packet loss would be to 
   command layer 2 to fast switch into the new attachment point as soon 
   as the packet tunneling begin. The time when Layer 3 receives the 
   acknowledgement is the most adequate. This scenario gives us another 
   example to describe a link layer activity triggered from Layer 3. 
    
   2.2 Optimal Selection of Radio Link 
    
   As more and more wireless networks are deployed and overlapped, 
   mobile hosts nowadays are equipped with multiple network interfaces. 
   Network technologies differ in terms of bandwidth, delay, capacity, 
   coverage and potentially their charging methods. As a result, how to 
   select the optimal network becomes an interesting problem. Moreover,

                 Upper Layer-driven Link Layer Action        July 2004 
 
 
   it is a more challenging task to seamlessly handover between these 
   networks. 
    
   In a heterogeneous network environment, vertical handover may be 
   triggered by lower layer events, e.g. the degradation of signal 
   strength or link-down. On the other hand, upper layers should also be 
   able to initiate vertical handover even when multiple radio links are 
   available. Upper layer entity, either in the mobile host or in 
   network side, determines the 'best' wireless interface and makes 
   handoff decision.  
    
   In this scenario, upper layer entity should monitor the dynamic 
   changes of different links, either currently connected or potentially 
   available. A polling message is issued by upper layers to MAC layer 
   of different types of links, periodically or event-triggered. The 
   status information of the link is reported to upper layers. 
    
   The vertical handoff decision may be based on a set of policies or 
   user preferences. After the handoff decision is made, the upper layer 
   issues commands to force a given interface to take an action, such as 
   connect or disconnect from a link. 
    
    
3. Interaction Semantics 
 
   The semantics of upper layer-driven link layer activity must be 
   generally defined so that many link layer technologies can easily 
   accept it. The mapping of these semantics to a set of specific layers 
   is implementation specific and out of scope. 
    
   3.1 Link_Poll_Request 
    
   This is issued by upper layer entities to discover the status of the 
   currently connected and potentially available links. The source of 
   this can be local or remote one. Parameters are defined as follows: 
    
   - Link type: 802.11/802.15/802.16e/GPRS/GSM/UMTS, etc 
   - Link layer identifier of polled interface 
   - Link layer identifier of polling network entity (in case of remote 
   type) 
   - Others (to be defined later) 
    
   3.2 Link_Poll_Response 
    
   This is corresponding to Link_Poll_Request to report link status to 
   Upper Layer Entities. The source of this is the recipient of 
   Link_Poll_Request, hence can be local or remote one. Parameters are 
   defined as follows:

                 Upper Layer-driven Link Layer Action        July 2004 
 
 
   - Link type: 802.11/802.15/802.16e/GPRS/GSM/UMTS, etc 
   - Link layer identifier of polled interface 
   - Link attributes: link quality, QoS parameters, security, attachment 
   point address, etc. 
   - Others (to be defined later) 
    
   3.3 Link_Switch_Request 
    
   This is issued by upper layer entities to force a given interface to 
   switch from one link to another. The source of this can be local or 
   remote one. Parameters are defined as follows: 
    
   - New link type 
   - Link layer identifier of interface 
   - Link layer identifier of new attachment point 
   - Reason codes: service price/QoS/user preferences, etc 
   - Others (to be defined later) 
    
   3.4 Link_Down_Request 
    
   This is issued by upper layer entities to force a given interface to 
   be inactive. So, the corresponding interface cannot be used to send 
   packets. The source of this can be local or remote one. Parameters 
   are defined as follows: 
    
   - Link layer identifier of interface 
   - Reason codes: service price/QoS/user preferences, etc 
   - Others (to be defined later) 
    
   3.5 Link_Up_Request 
    
   This is issued by upper layer entities to force a given interface to 
   be active. So, upper layers use the corresponding interface to send 
   packets. The source of this can be local or remote one. Parameters 
   are defined as follows: 
    
   - Link layer identifier of interface 
   - Reason codes: service price/QoS/user preferences, etc 
   - Others (to be defined later) 
    
   3.6 Link_Switch_Response/Link_Down_Response/Link_Up_Response 
    
   These are issued by a link layer to report the result of 
   Link_Switch_Request/Link_Down_Request/Link_Up_Request, respectively. 
   The sources of these are the recipients of each corresponding request, 
   hence can be local or remote one. Parameters are defined as follows: 
    
   - Result codes: success/failure 
   - Others (to be defined later)

4. Security Considerations 
    
   Secure interactions between the upper layers and the link layer MUST 
   be ensured, since upper layer-driven link layer activity is typically 
   insecure. A spoofed or modified upper layer request can still be used 
   to launch the potential denial of service attacks on the host and the 
   associated network. This is especially important in cases where 
   insecure interactions are used as a substitute for the existing 
   secure mechanisms.  
    
   Source of interaction initiator may be not authenticated or 
   authorized in case of local interaction mechanism. However, the 
   authentication and authorization MUST be always required when the 
   source is remote one.
