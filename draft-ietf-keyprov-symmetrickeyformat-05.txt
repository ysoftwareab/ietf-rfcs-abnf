Abstract 

   This document defines the symmetric key format content type.  It is 
   transport independent. The Cryptographic Message Syntax can be used 
   to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt this content 
   type.

1. Introduction 

   This document defines the symmetric key format content type.  It is 
   transport independent. The Cryptographic Message Syntax [RFC3852] can 
   be used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt this 
   content type. 

   The uses cases that motivated this work are elaborated in [PSKC].  
   They are omitted to avoid duplication. 

1.1. Requirements Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

1.2. ASN.1 Syntax Notation 

   The key package is defined using the ASN.1 [X.680, X.681, X.682, 
   X.683]. 

2. Symmetric Key Package Content Type 

   The symmetric key package content type is used to transfer one or 
   more plaintext symmetric keys from one party to another.  A symmetric 
   key package MAY be encapsulated in one or more CMS protecting content 
   types.  This content type must be DER encoded [X.690].

Internet-Draft    Symmetric Key Package Content Type          July 2009 
    

   The symmetric key package content type has the following syntax: 

     PKCS7-CONTENT-TYPE ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER 

     symmetric-key-package PKCS7-CONTENT-TYPE ::= 
       { SymmetricKeyPackage IDENTIFIED BY id-ct-KP-sKeyPackage } 

     id-ct-KP-sKeyPackage OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= | 
       { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) 
         smime(16) ct(1) 25 } 

     SymmetricKeyPackage ::= SEQUENCE { 
       version          KeyPkgVersion DEFAULT v1, 
       sKeyPkgAtts  [0] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute OPTIONAL, 
       sKeys            SymmetricKeys } 

     SymmetricKeys ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF OneSymmetricKey 

     OneSymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE { 
       sKeyAttrs  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute OPTIONAL, 
       sKey       OCTET STRING OPTIONAL 
                  -- At least sKeyAttrs or sKey MUST be present. 
     } 

     KeyPkgVersion ::= INTEGER  { v1(1), ... } 

   The SymmetricKeyPackage fields are used as follows: 

   - version identifies version of the symmetric key package content 
     structure.  For this version of the specification, the default 
     value, v1, MUST be used. 

   - sKeyPkgAttrs optionally provides attributes that apply to all of 
     the symmetric keys in the package.  If an attribute appears here it 
     MUST NOT also be included in sKeyAttrs. 

   - sKeys contains a sequence of OneSymmetricKey values.  This 
     structure is discussed below. 

   The OneSymmetricKey fields are used as follows: 

   - sKeyAttrs optionally provides attributes that apply to one 
      symmetric key. If an attribute appears here it MUST NOT also be 
      included in sKeyPkgAttrs. 

   - sKey optionally contains the key value encoded as an OCTET STRING.

Internet-Draft    Symmetric Key Package Content Type          July 2009 
    

   The OneSymmetricKey field MUST include either sKeyAttrs, sKey, or 
   sKeyAttrs and sKey. 

3. Security Considerations 

   The symmetric key package contents are not protected.  This content 
   type can be combined with a security protocol to protect the contents 
   of the package. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   None: All identifiers are already registered.  Please remove this 
   section prior to publication as an RFC.
