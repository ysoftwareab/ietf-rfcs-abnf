2. Abstract 
    
   This document presents an overview of SNMPv3 compliance with the AAA 
   protocol requirements for network access as stipulated in the 
   "Network Access AAA Evaluation Criteria" Internet Draft dated April 
   26, 2000 [1].  SNMPv3 protocol features and capabilities directly 
   support many of the AAA requirements.  In addition, the more 
   sophisticated management model (see Section 5, below) now underlying 
   SNMP -- which has evolved from the original model introduced in the 
   late 1980s under the guidance of extensive  use in the field -- 
   enables the design, development, and deployment of more 
   sophisticated management applications geared to the overall body of 
   AAA protocol requirements (or sub-sets thereof).

   SNMPv3 protocol features and capabilities directly support many of 
   the AAA requirements.  In addition, the contemporary management 
   model (see Section 5, below) now underlying SNMP -- which has 
   evolved from the original model introduced in the late 1980s under 
   the guidance of extensive  use in the field -- enables the design, 
   development, and deployment of more sophisticated management 
   applications geared to the overall body of AAA protocol requirements 
   (or sub-sets thereof). 
    
4.1. Requirements language 
    
   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", 
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
   in RFC 2119. 
    
4.2. Terminology 
    
   This document describes the compliance status of version 3 of the 
   Simple Network Management Protocol ("SNMPv3") with respect to the 
   known AAA requirements as stated in [1] (aka [ACCT-RQTS], with 
   relevant elaborations in [2] (aka [ROAMOPS]), [3] (aka [NASREQ]), 
   [4], and [5] (aka [MOBILE IP]). 
    
   SNMPv3 is defined by the following documents: 
    
      RFC2570, "Introduction to Version 3 of the Internet-standard 
                Network Management Framework". [6] 
    
      RFC2571, "An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management 
                Frameworks". [7] 
    
      RFC2572, "Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple 
                Network Management Protocol (SNMP)". [8] 
    
      RFC2573, "SNMP Applications". [9] (aka [APPS]) 
    
      RFC2574, "User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of 
                the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)". 
                [10] (aka [USM]) 
    
      RFC2575, "View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the 
                Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)". [11] 
                (aka [VACM]) 
    
      RFC2576, "Coexistence between Version 1, Version 2, and 
                Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network 
                Management Framework". [12] 
    
   SNMPv3 is a protocol with which management entities communicate with 
   each other about management operations performed on managed objects.

   The managed objects available for the set of management operations 
   supported between a given pair of SNMPv3 entities logically reside 
   in a virtual information store known as a management information 
   base (MIB).  The logical structure of the data store and the 
   relevant attributes of the managed objects supported by it 
   are defined using an adapted subset of the OSI ASN.1 specification 
   language known as the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  
   The current version of the SMI is version 2 ("SMIv2").  This is the 
   version referenced by this document. 
    
   SMIv2 is defined by the following documents: 
    
      RFC2578, "Structure of Management Information Version 2 
                (SMIv2)". [13] 
    
      RFC2579, "Textual Conventions for SMIv2". [14] 
    
      RFC2580, "Conformance Statements for SMIv2". [15] 
    
   For the purposes of this document, "SNMPv3" is intended to subsume 
   "SMIv2".  Furthermore, any otherwise unqualified references to 
   "SNMP" in this document are intended to refer to "SNMPv3" only.  
   That is, references to earlier versions of SNMP (i.e., SNMPv1 or 
   SNMPv2c), will be made explicit by saying "SNMPv1" or "SNMPv2c", as 
   the case may be.  This is also true for the term "SMI" and its 
   previous version, "SMIv1".  
    
   The SNMPv3 AAA protocol submission consists of the ten RFCs 
   identified above in this section. 
    
    
5. Compliance Summary 
    
   The compliance information provided in the following sections of 
   this document maps directly to the tables of requirements presented 
   in [1].  As a result, this compliance information represents a 
   summary view of both AAA requirements statements and the 
   corresponding SNMPv3 compliance statements.  Substantial additional 
   detail on both sides of the equations will likely be needed to form 
   a precise operational understanding of the requirements and the 
   role that SNMPv3 plays in satisfying them.  However, the goal of 
   this document is merely to establish the viability, validity, and 
   value of SNMPv3 as a constituent element of an overall Internet 
   standards based approach to meeting the stated AAA requirements. 
    
   That is, the technologies and operations encompassed by the AAA 
   triad --  authentication, authorization, and accounting -- cover a 
   large span of multi-dimensional "problem space".  Also, some of the 
   stated requirements (aka, "evaluation criteria") seem to apply at a 
   protocol level, while others seem to apply to a service level (i.e., 
   a level which uses a protocol...e.g., as an SNMP "engine" uses the 
   SNMPv3 protocol) and others yet to an application level (i.e., a 
  
Natale                  Expires December 2000                       3 

 
INTERNET-DRAFT              SNMPv3 for AAA                   June 2000 
 
 
   level which uses such services...e.g., an SNMPv3 command generator 
   entity).  Therefore, it may be unrealistic to expect a single 
   protocol to define the corresponding "solution space". 
    
   This document takes the perspective that SNMPv3 can play a valuable 
   role in defining such a solution space for AAA, but only in 
   conjunction with a set (hopefully a small set) of other protocols 
   which will provide compliant functionality in those areas where 
   SNMPv3 either cannot (by virtue of its nature) or does not (by 
   virtue of its details) do so. 
    
   Furthermore, the role of SNMPv3 in the solution space for AAA must 
   be seen as consisting of the following elements: 
    
      - The SNMPv3 protocol itself. 
    
      - SNMP management entities. 
    
      - SNMP MIBs. 
    
      - A physical model of an SNMP management network. 
    
      - SNMP scalability mechanisms. 
    
      - On-going SNMP network management research and development. 
    
   The specific assessments made in the individual requirements 
   compliance sections later in this document incorporate an 
   expectation that all of the elements encompassed by the foregoing 
   list -- and briefly described in the sub-sections which immediately 
   follow this paragraph -- collaborate to define SNMPv3 compliance to 
   the AAA requirements.  By and large, we are talking about components 
   and capabilities which exist today -- most of which have a long 
   record of validation in the field -- although we may need to put 
   some of the elements together in slightly different ways than we 
   have in the past and some new derivations from model elements 
   may need to be constructed from these components. 
    
5.1.  The SNMPv3 protocol itself 
    
   Over and above the core operational capabilities of previous 
   versions of SNMP, SNMPv3 provides for the following security 
   services [USM]: 
    
       - Data integrity:  Assurance that data has not been altered or 
         destroyed in an unauthorized manner, nor have data sequences  
         been altered to an extent greater than can occur non- 
         maliciously. 
    
       - Data origin authentication:  Assurance that the claimed  
         identity of the user on whose behalf received data was  
         originated is corroborated.

INTERNET-DRAFT              SNMPv3 for AAA                   June 2000 
 
 
    
       - Data confidentiality:  Assurance that information is not made 
         available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities,  
         or processes. 
    
       - Message timeliness and limited replay protection:  Assurance  
         that a message whose generation time is outside of a specified  
         time window is not accepted. 
    
    ...and data object security services [VACM]: 
    
       - Access control:  Assurance that a specific type of access  
         (read, write, notify) to a particular object (instance) is  
         authorized or is otherwise disallowed. 
    
5.2.  SNMP management entities [APPS] 
    
   As opposed to the traditional view of SNMP management entities as 
   either "agents" or "managers", SNMPv3 views an SNMP management 
   entity as (among other things) any combination of the following 
   types of application-layer functionality: 
    
       - Command generators: Initiate read- and/or write-class  
         messages. 
    
       - Command responders: Respond to read- and/or write-class  
         messages. 
    
       - Notification originators:  Originate notification-class  
         messages. 
    
       - Notification receivers:  Receive notification-class messages. 
    
       - Proxy forwarders:  Forward SNMP messages. 
    
   This refinement facilitates the design, development, and deployment 
   of both more focused (e.g., notification receivers) and more complex 
   (e.g., "dual-role entities", "mid-level managers") SNMP management 
   entities, providing a richer set of solutions to the user community. 
    
   This broader scope for application modeling serves to enlarge the 
   range of AAA operational requirements that SNMPv3 can viably 
   address.  Furthermore, additional SNMP application types can be 
   defined as well -- we are not limited to only the five types already 
   defined.  Thus, it is feasible to consider new SNMP application 
   types corresponding to specialized AAA processes, as well as 
   possible new SNMP PDU formats optimized for those processes. 
    
5.3.  SNMP MIBs 
    
   As opposed to the traditional view of SNMP MIBs as consisting of 
   primarily (to exclusively) atomic objects representing individual

INTERNET-DRAFT              SNMPv3 for AAA                   June 2000 
 
 
   discrete data items (or collection of such items into conceptual 
   rows and tables), a more current view of efficient and effective 
   composition calls for the design and inclusion of higher-level 
   objects that can represent aggregations of discrete data items, 
   virtual objects, result sets, states, actions, and so forth. 
    
   Such more powerful MIBs exhibit a symbiotic relationship with the 
   more sophisticated SNMP applications architectures described above 
   in that they are both enabled by those architectural possibilities 
   and, in turn, drive the development of the more capable applications 
   which implement such architectures. 
    
5.4.  A physical model of an SNMP management network 
    
   The origins of SNMP -- and especially the original motivation for 
   the "Simple" in its moniker -- can be traced directly to one of its 
   underlying tenets...indeed, its "fundamental axiom" [ROSE, p. 71]: 
    
      "The impact of adding network management to managed nodes 
       must be minimal, reflecting a lowest common denominator." 
    
   While arguably correct for its time, this axiom is no longer valid 
   in its literal rendition for the general case.  Managed nodes (now 
   "managed elements", to reflect the more diverse range of things 
   which can and/or should be managed via SNMP) have become more 
   capable (CPU, memory, interface speeds, etc.).  More significantly, 
   the potential benefits (in terms of market share, payoff, ROI, and 
   similar economic concepts) of adding management features to a 
   managed element are now seen as being worth some degree of added 
   cost (e.g., monetary and/or impact on other aspects of the element). 
   Perhaps the following may be a valid re-statement of the axiom for 
   current circumstances: 
    
      "The total cost (economic and operational) of adding network 
       management capabilities to managed elements must be appropriate, 
       reflecting the expected benefits (direct and/or indirect)." 
    
   By and large, this change in perspective mirrors changes in the 
   larger economic, technological, and sociological landscape and does 
   not imply any kind of flaw in the fundamental axiom for an earlier 
   point in time. 
    
5.5.  SNMP scalability mechanisms 
    
   The contemporary SNMP solutions framework includes multiple, non- 
   exclusionary approaches to scalability, including: 
    
      - An IETF standard for extensible SNMP agents ("AgentX") 
    
      - A set of IETF standard MIBs for distributed management  
        ("DISMAN")

INTERNET-DRAFT              SNMPv3 for AAA                   June 2000 
 
 
      - Proxy applications 
    
5.5.1.  An IETF standard for extensible SNMP agents ("AgentX") 
    
   An extensible SNMP agent environment is one in which an SNMP entity 
   known as a "master agent" provides the external interface (for both 
   in-coming and out-going SNMP messages) to other SNMP entities on 
   behalf of a set of "sub-agents" that need not deal with SNMP 
   directly.  The purpose of an extensible SNMP agent environment is 
   twofold:  First, to provide the infrastructure for shared use of a 
   well-known SNMP port by multiple, independently developed agent 
   entities; and second, they make it technically easier and 
   economically more viable for component suppliers to provide an SNMP 
   management interface to those components. 
    
   Extensible SNMP agent environments have been available for a long 
   time from a number of suppliers and have played an important role 
   in the broad deployment of SNMP solutions.  However, the lack of an 
   IETF standard protocol for agent extensibility was seen as a 
   probable barrier to the widest possible deployment of such 
   solutions.  Hence, the IETF eventually standardized the "AgentX" 
   protocol to fill this need.  The relevant documents are: 
    
      RFC2471, "Agent Extensibility (AgentX) Protocol Version 1". 
                [16] (aka [AGENTX]) 
    
      RFC2472, "Definitions of Managed Objects for Extensible SNMP 
                Agents".  [17] (aka [AGENTX-MIB]) 
    
   Extensible SNMP agents can play important roles in the enabling of 
   various kinds of important AAA applications, especially (but not 
   only) those involved in data collection, filtering, aggregation, 
   analysis, packaging, and forwarding.

   TBD. 
    
5.5.3.  SNMP Proxy 
    
   TDB. 
    
5.6.  On-going SNMP network management research and development 
    
   The IRTF NMRG has proposed a number of enhancements to SNMP to 
   improve its suitability for certain AAA applications, especially in 
   the area of accounting services.  These are described and discussed 
   in ample detail in Section 7.3 of [ACCT-MGMT].  Collectively, we 
   will refer to them as "the NMRG extensions".  They include: 
    
      - an SNMP-over-TCP transport mapping [NMRG-1]

      - SNMP payload compression [NMRG-2] 
    
      - addition of a "get subtree" retrieval capability [NMRG-3] 
    
   Please note that these proposed changes are of an experimental 
   nature at this time and, for some of them, active discussion within 
   the SNMP community is underway.  The present document takes the 
   perspective that -- while some or all of the NMRG extensions may be 
   beneficial in enhancing SNMP's role as an AAA protocol -- these 
   changes are not *required* to qualify SNMP as an important protocol 
   for use in the AAA solution set. 
    
   Finally, it must be noted that this document (as of rev -00) is an 
   initial draft.  It has been authored by someone with far more 
   knowledge (albeit imperfect) of SNMP than of the range of AAA 
   requirements.  And it has received helpful but limited prior review 
   by others who are more knowledgeable with respect to those 
   requirements.  So, it is submitted in good faith as a working 
   document and revisions -- perhaps including significant corrections 
   -- are to be expected.

   the stated requirement(s).  A small number of entries have a status 
   value of "?", indicating that the compliance or non-compliance of 
   SNMPv3 with the requirement could not be determined at this time 
   (mainly due to lack of understanding on the part of the author of 
   the "-00" version!). 
    
   It should be noted that the author of the "-00" version of this 
   document cannot claim expertise in many of the specific AAA 
   requirements listed in the following sections.  Furthermore, the 
   vision he has of how SNMPv3 can be used to help form a compliant 
   AAA solution set requires sometimes creative use of all of the 
   SNMPv3 dimensions discussed in Section 5, above.  While the 
   author has tried to make an honest judgment about SNMPv3 
   compliance with each requirement in the context of those 
   considerations, the results clearly suggest that more errors 
   were made on the side of compliance than of non-compliance. 
   It is anticipated (and hoped for) that subsequent review and 
   scrutiny by a wider audience of more expert readers will lead 
   to proper adjustments in the text.

   | [a]  The AAA protocol must be capable of supporting millions of |

   | architecture and protocol MUST be capable of supporting tens of | 
   | thousands of devices, AAA servers, proxies and brokers.         | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | SNMPv3 satisfies this requirement.  SNMP has existence proofs of| 
   | supporting networks with tens of thousands of managed nodes.    | 
   | the text in the note (a) referring to "millions of users" and   | 
   | "tens of thousands of simultaneous requests" does not seem      | 
   | relevant to the envisioned role(s) for SNMPv3 in AAA, which will| 
   | likely be tied to administrative and operating domains of       | 
   | smaller (yet large in an absolute sense) scope.                 | 
   |                                                                 | 
   | To be sure these numbers do mean that distributed management    | 
   | facilities for collection, aggregation, filtering, analysis,    | 
   | packaging, forwarding, and so forth will be critical in such an |    
   | environment.  The DISMAN series of MIBs suggest that SNMP can be| 
   | deployed in ways that will scale to meet the needs of networks  | 
   | of the sizes required for AAA.                                  |

   | [b]  In the event of failure to communicate with a given server,| 
   | the protocol must provide a mechanism to change service to      | 
   | another backup or secondary server.                             | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | SNMP satisfies this requirement via the application-layer       |

   | and/or higher-|order SNMP entities.                             |

   | [c]  This requirement refers to the ability to support mutual   | 
   | authentication between the AAA client and server.               | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | SNMPv3 security features satisfy this requirement.              | 
   | The requirement is that a server can explicitly authenticate a  | 
   | client, and that a client can explicitly authenticate a server. | 
   | SNMP does this in USM by the use of shared keys, timeliness     | 
   | checking, message IDs sequencing, etc.  New security models may | 
   | add new mechanisms as well.                                     | 
   | Also, the use of protocols and methods other than SNMPv3 by AAA | 
   | clients and servers is not precluded by the envisioned use of   | 
   | SNMPv3 for AAA.                                                 |

   | [d]  The AAA protocol requires authentication, integrity        |

   | security model is also referred to as hop-by-hop security,      | 
   | whereas the security is established between two communicating   | 
   | peers. All of the security is removed when the AAA message is   | 
   | processed by a receiving AAA entity.                            |

6.1.5.  Data object confidentiality 
    
   It is important to note that this draft (throughout) interprets the 
   terms "data object" and "attribute" (as used in the AAA requirements 
   documents) as more or less synonymous.

   In mapping such data objects/attributes to SNMPv3 concepts --  
   especially where protection (integrity and/or confidentiality) is 
   required -- this draft envisions a corresponding set of SNMP "MIB 
   objects".  These may be thought of as something like: 
    
     - a group of related MIB objects (e.g., MIB sub-tree branch) 
    
     - a row of objects in a MIB table 
    
     - an opaque structure-like object comprised of a set of 
       MIB objects 
    
     - ...or anything that works better. 
    
   The key idea is that such an "AAA data object" is actually a fairly 
   "complex" life form, not a simple single object with a name and a 
   value.  Furthermore, among the set of MIB objects comprising such an 
   AAA data object would be the necessary security parameters to allow 
   for integrity and confidentiality, including timeliness 
   verification. 
    
   The bottom line is that individual AAA data object security is 
   independent from the overall SNMPv3 message security.  An easy way 
   to envision this is to imagine USM being applied to such a set of 
   MIB objects with a different set of valid securityNames from those 
   used at the message processing usmUserTable level.  That is surely 
   not the only way to implement this -- and not necessarily the one 
   to be recommended -- but it might be the easiest to envision (and 
   critique!) quickly.

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [e]  The AAA protocol requires confidentiality at the object    | 
   | level, where an object consists of one or more attributes.      | 
   | Object level confidentiality implies that only the target AAA   | 
   | entity for whom the data is ultimately destined may decrypt the | 
   | data, regardless of the fact that the message may traverse one  | 
   | or more intermediate AAA entities (e.g. proxies, brokers).      | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | SNMPv3 security features (including the use of VACM for the     | 
   | "attribute-by-attribute" stipulation in Sec. 4.2.6 of [ROAMOPS])|

   |  Integrity            |   16    |   6     |  31 39  |           | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [f]  The AAA protocol requires authentication and integrity     | 
   | protection at the object level, which consists of one or more   | 
   | attributes.  Object level authentication must be persistent     | 
   | across one or more intermediate AAA entity (e.g. proxy, broker, | 
   | etc), meaning that any AAA entity in a proxy chain may verify   | 
   | the authentication.  This implies that data that is covered by  | 
   | object level security CANNOT be modified by intermediate        | 
   | servers.                                                        | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | There appear to be at least two different requirements in this  | 
   | statement.  On the one hand, SNMPv3 security features satisfy   | 
   | the requirement for protection against modification of object   | 
   | data by intermediate servers between two target end-points.  On | 
   | the other hand, SNMPv3 security features also provide for       | 
   | ensuring that object level authentication is persistent across  | 
   | one or more intermediate AAA entities.  But SNMPv3 security     | 
   | would not, therefore, enable those intermediate AAA entities to | 
   | directly verify the authentication.  Such a capability could    | 
   | perhaps be enabled by wrapping an SNMPv3 payload inside another | 
   | SNMPv3 message, with the "outer wrapper" message carrying       | 
   | authentication parameters verifiable by the next intermediate   | 
   | entity.  This document does not propose such a solution,        | 
   | however, electing, instead, to leave SNMPv3 compliance with this| 
   | partial requirement unclear.                                    |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [g]  The AAA protocol MUST be capable of transporting           | 
   | certificates.  This requirement is intended as an optimization, | 
   | in lieu of requiring that an out-of-band protocol be used to    | 
   | fetch certificates.                                             | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | Given resolution of concerns about certificate sizes relative to| 
   | SNMPv3 transport capacities and given the definition of MIB     | 
   | objects for certificate transport, SNMPv3 is capable of         | 
   | transporting certificate data.  However, it is worth considering| 
   | whether the potential cost of this optimization truly offsets   | 
   | the potential benefits of a specialized protocol or service to  | 
   | handle transport and other certificate-related operations.      |

   |    successfully, separate from message semantics or syntax      | 
   |    evaluation.                                                  | 
   | 4. Piggy-backing of acknowledgments in AAA messages.            | 
   | 5. Timely delivery of AAA responses.                            | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | Standard SNMPv3 over UDP meets some of these requirements; work | 
   | outlined in the NMRG enhancements for running SNMP over TCP (and| 
   | possibly other connection-oriented and/or "reliable" transports)| 
   | may satisfy additional aspects of this set of requirements:     | 
   |                                                                 | 
   | 1.  Unsure what this means exactly.  SNMPv3 application level   | 
   |     retransmission logic is typically end-to-end.               | 
   | 2.  This requirement is typically met by SNMPv3 engines and/or  | 
   |     application entities.                                       | 
   | 3.  For standard SNMPv3 over UDP, successfully delivered request| 
   |     messages are "acknowledged" via a response message (where   | 
   |     "successfully delivered" means that it was received, parsed,| 
   |     and authenticated without exception per the SNMPv3 elements | 
   |     of procedure).                                              | 
   | 4.  SNMPv3 does not support piggy-backing of acknowledgements.  | 
   |     Furthermore, SNMPv3 logic questions the value of message    | 
   |     acknowledgment below the application level (i.e., what is   | 
   |     the value of knowing that a message was received but perhaps| 
   |     not accepted or acted upon at the application level?).      | 
   | 5.  SNMPv3 imposes only moderate average overhead on its        | 
   |     payloads, and (based on extensive field experience with     | 
   |     earlier versions of SNMP) would not likely introduce a      | 
   |     performance bottleneck.  The slowest part of a secure SNMPv3| 
   |     transaction is the security processing which is performed   | 
   |     via protocols independent of SNMP (with the current defaults| 
   |     being MD5 or SHA for authentication and DES for encryption  | 
   |    ...faster security models and/or protocols for use with      | 
   |    SNMPv3 may be introduced in the future).                     | 
   |                                                                 | 
   | Finally, since SNMPv3 messages exhibit no intrinsic dependency  | 
   | on the transport protocol used to carry them, SNMPv3 may be     | 
   | malleable to running over any more reliable/capable/faster      | 
   | transport layer protocol that the AAA standards may eventually  | 
   | mandate.                                                        |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | Experimental versions of SNMPv3 currently satisfy this          | 
   | requirement.  Standardization of IPv6 support for SNMP is       | 
   | underway and is expected to be straightforward (via new textual | 
   | conventions) for the protocol itself.  SNMPv3 compliance with   | 
   | this requirement can be expected when needed.                   | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [i]  In the Mobile IP AAA architecture, brokers can be in the   |       
   | forwarding path, in which case they act as transparent proxies  | 
   | (proxy brokers).  Alternatively, it is also possible to conceive| 
   | of brokers operating as certifying authorities outside of the   | 
   | forwarding path (routing brokers).                              | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | SNMPv3 proxy forwarding capabilities/applications appear to     | 
   | satisfy this requirement.  However, the issues raised wrt       | 
   | authentication by intermediate AAA entities above (in Section   | 
   | 6.1.6) may negate this apparent degree of compliance.           |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [j]  An auditable process is one in which it is possible to     |

   | SNMPv3 entities could satisfy this requirement in a variety of  | 
   | ways at the application level.                                  |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [k]  The AAA protocol MUST allow communication to be secured.   | 
   | However, the AAA protocol MUST also allow an underlying security| 
   | service (e.g. IP Security) to be used. When the latter is used, | 
   | the former MUST NOT be required.                                | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | Use of the security features of SNMPv3 is optional.             | 
   |                                                                 | 
   | Moreover, the structure of SNMPv3 messages enables them to be   | 
   | sent -- with or without using the security features -- over a   | 
   | secure lower-layer protocol (such as IPsec), given appropriate  | 
   | corresponding end-point security facilities.                    | 
   |                                                                 | 
   | Use of the full intrinsic SNMPv3 security does require shared   | 
   | secrets between SNMPv3 end-point entities; however, the protocol| 
   | incorporates a localization scheme which mitigates the          | 
   | scalability and management problems often associated with shared| 
   | secret systems.                                                 | 
   |                                                                 | 
   | In SNMPv3, USM is required for purposes of interoperability,    | 
   | especially for troubleshooting, and a shared secret is the      | 
   | standard approach for USM.  For purposes other than             | 
   | troubleshooting, a shared secret would not necessarily be       | 
   | required.  To put this another way, because SNMP would be       | 
   | serving purposes beyond AAA, and for those non-AAA purposes     | 
   | interoperability and availability are paramount, shared secrets | 
   | are required for those other, non-AAA, purposes.                |

   | [l]  The AAA protocol MUST be extensible by third parties (e.g. | 
   | other IETF Working Groups), in order to define attributes that  | 
   | are specific to the service being defined. This requirement     | 
   | simply means that the AAA protocol MUST allow groups other than | 
   | the AAA WG to define standard attributes.                       |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [b]  The AAA protocol MUST allow CHAP [20] authentication       | 
   | information to be transported. This is commonly used by Network | 
   | Access Servers that request authentication of a PPP user.       | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | SNMPv3 supports this requirement via MIB objects which can be   | 
   | created for this purpose.                                       | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [c]  The AAA protocol MUST allow for Extensible Authentication  | 
   | Protocol (EAP) [14] payload to be transported. Since some EAP   | 
   | authentication mechanisms require more than one round trip, the | 
   | AAA protocol must allow for such authentication mechanisms to be| 
   | used.  The actual EAP authentication mechanism negotiated MUST  | 
   | be transparent to the AAA protocol. When EAP is used,           | 
   | authentication typically occurs between the user being          | 
   | authenticated and his/her home AAA server.                      | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | SNMPv3 partially supports this requirement via MIB objects which| 
   | can be created for this purpose.  A complete EAP-authentication | 
   | scheme built around AAA use of SNMPv3 will likely require       | 
   | further analysis and design efforts, at a minimum.              |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [d]  While PAP is deprecated, it is still in widespread use for | 
   | its original intended purpose, which is support of clear-text   | 
   | passwords.  As a result, a AAA protocol will need to be able to | 
   | securely transport clear-text passwords. This includes providing| 
   | for confidentiality of clear-text passwords traveling over the  | 
   | wire, as well as protecting against disclosure of clear-text    | 
   | passwords to proxies in the forwarding path.                    | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | Given MIB objects designed for this purpose, SNMPv3 can carry   | 
   | clear-text passwords as message data objects.  When such        | 
   | messages are sent using the privacy (encryption) facilities of  | 
   | SNMPv3, both the confidentiality of these passwords on-the-wire | 
   | and protection from unauthorized disclosure of them at an end-  | 
   | point are ensured.                                              |

   | [e]  The AAA protocol MUST allow for a user to be re-           |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [a]  The AAA protocol MUST allow a server to provide a static or| 
   | dynamic address during the authorization phase of a user and/or | 
   | device.  The address assigned MUST be either of type IPv4 or    | 
   | IPv6.  An address is considered static when a user requests a   | 
   | specific address, and it is present in the authorization        | 
   | request. An address is considered dynamic when the AAA server   | 
   | assigns an address to the user that is either defined in his    | 
   | profile, or from an address pool managed by the server.         | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | SNMPv3 can support both IPv4 and/or IPv6 MIB objects for use by | 
   | AAA authorization processes.  Whether values for such objects   | 
   | come from static or dynamic sources, as defined above, is       |

   | [b]  This requirement refers to the ability of a new AAA        |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [d]  This requirement refers to the ability of the AAA client or|    
   | server to trigger re-authorization, or to the ability of the    | 
   | server to send updated authorization information to the device, | 
   | such as "stop service." Authorization can allow for a time      | 
   | period, then additional authorization can be sought to continue.| 
   | A server can initially authorize a user to connect and receive  | 
   | services, but later decide the user is no longer allowed use of | 
   | the service, for example after N minutes. Authorizations can    | 
   | have a time limit. Re-authorization does not necessarily imply  | 
   | re-authentication.                                              |

   | [f]  This requirement refers to the ability of the NAS to use   | 
   | the AAA server to manage resource allocation state. This        | 
   | capability can assist with, but it is not synonymous with,      | 
   | simultaneous user login control, port usage limitations, or IP  | 
   | address pooling. The design must provide for recovery from data | 
   | loss due to a variety of faults, including NAS and AAA server   | 
   | reboots, and NAS/AAA server communication outages. The          | 
   | granularity of the recovery of state information after an outage| 
   | may be on the order of a fraction of a minute. In order to      | 
   | provide for state recovery, the following capabilities are      |

   | If non-volatile memory is present, it is believed that only     | 
   | elements 1 - 3 are needed. However, since this will not always  | 
   | be true, other mechanisms are also needed. Mechanism 4 provides | 
   | recovery time on the order of the interim interval, and so may  | 
   | be too slow in many cases. Mechanisms 5-7 can be useful but are | 
   | not implementable at Internet scale for use in applications such|

   | order of seconds, not milliseconds.                             | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | SNMPv3 solutions can support the real-time accounting           | 
   | requirements by, for example, permitting Sets of MIB objects    | 
   | designed to govern the timely transfer of accumulated accounting| 
   | data (perhaps via out-of-band means) and/or via the use of      | 
   | InformRequest PDUs to send "real-time" accounting records.      |

   | [b]  The AAA protocol's Accounting data format MUST NOT be      | 
   | bloated, imposing a large overhead for one or more accounting   | 
   | data elements.                                                  | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | In general, SNMPv3 solutions will not impose any format         | 
   | requirements on accounting data.  In cases where large amounts  | 
   | of accounting data are to be transmitted, this process will     | 
   | likely be *managed* via SNMPv3 MIB objects, but actually        | 
   | executed via some external protocol (e.g., FTP, HTTP) which may | 
   | or may not impose format requirements on the data.  In cases    | 
   | where smaller amounts of accounting data are to be transferred  | 
   | via SNMPv3 messages -- as in the real-time accounting           | 
   | requirements covered above -- a variety of appropriate MIB      | 
   | object definitions will be available (e.g., perhaps             | 
   | corresponding to [ADIF] specifications), some of which may      | 
   | optimize for size while others may optimize for other factors,  | 
   | depending upon the relevant AAA application(s).                 |

   | SNMPv3 MIB objects will be used to represent accounting records | 
   | and other accounting data elements as may be required (e.g.,    | 
   | perhaps corresponding to [ADIF] specifications).  SNMP MIBs are | 
   | extensible by definition.  In cases of accounting data files,   | 
   | the SNMPv3 MIB representation may be completely opaque (e.g.,   | 
   | OCTET_STRING type).                                             |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [c]  This requirement refers to the ability to buffer or store  | 
   | multiple accounting records, and send them together at some     | 
   | later time.                                                     | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | SNMPv3 MIB objects will be used to control and schedule         | 
   | accounting data collection (e.g., bucket size, time span) and   | 
   | transfer (e.g., targets, protocol to be used, transmission      | 
   | parameters) allowing for batch accounting.  Note that some SNMP | 
   | MIBs (e.g., in the ATM space) already provide models for this   | 
   | form of accounting.                                             |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | For in-band transmission of accounting data (e.g., for real-time| 
   | accounting records), an SNMPv3 InformRequest message (receipt of| 
   | which will be acknowledged by the target entity) can be used to | 
   | actually carry the accounting data.  For out-of-band            | 
   | transmission of accounting data (e.g., batch file transfer), an | 
   | InformRequest message can be used to notify an interested       |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [e]  This requirement refers to the ability to reflect the time | 
   | of occurrence of events such as log-on, logoff, authentication, | 
   | authorization and interim accounting. It also implies the       | 
   | ability to provide for unambiguous time-stamps.                 | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | The SNMPv3 DateAndTime textual convention [RFC2579] can be used | 
   | to define MIB objects that satisfy this requirement for use in  | 
   | AAA applications.                                               |

   | [f]  This requirement refers to the ability to account for      | 
   | dynamic authentication and authorization. To support this, there| 
   | can be multiple accounting records for a single session.        | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------|

   | the number of accounting records generated for a single session.|

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | Given that the Mobile IP registration message may be represented| 
   | in an SNMPv3 solution as a set of one or more data objects then | 
   | it could be encoded at the object level and/or at the SNMPv3    | 
   | scopedPDU encryption level.                                     |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | [a]  A firewall friendly protocol is one which is designed to   | 
   | accommodate a firewall acting as a proxy. For example, this     | 
   | would permit a Home Agent AAA server situated behind a firewall | 
   | to be reachable from the Internet for the purposes of providing | 
   | AAA services to a Mobile IP Foreign Agent.                      | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | SNMP over UDP is not generally considered firewall friendly.  It| 
   | is possible, however, that SNMPv3 messages will be looked upon  | 
   | more favorably by firewall administrators due to the advanced   | 
   | security features it offers.                                    |

   |-----------------------------------------------------------------| 
   | SNMPv3 compliance or non-compliance with this requirement is not| 
   | determinable at this time (due to lack of understanding of the  | 
   | requirement on the part of this author!).                       |

7.  Conclusion 
    
   Based upon the foregoing caveats, explanations, analyses, and 
   responses, it would appear that SNMPv3 is well prepared to play 
   a significant role in an IETF standard AAA solution set.  This 
   role would involve the SNMPv3 protocol itself, SNMP MIBs, SNMP- 
   enabled AAA applications, IETF-standard extensible SNMP agents, 
   SNMP distributed management mechanisms, and other related 
   components.  So, while this draft does not propose a simple,

   monolithic SNMPv3 answer to all of the AAA requirements, it 
   does hope to justify a significant role for SNMPv3 in the 
   overall AAA solution set.
