Abstract

   The existing Session Description Protocol (SDP) bandwidth modifiers
   and their values include the bandwidth needed also for the transport
   and IP layers. When using SDP in protocols like Session Announcement
   Protocol (SAP), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Real-Time
   Streaming Protocol (RTSP) and the involved hosts reside in networks
   running different IP versions, the interpretation of what type of
   lower layers that is included is not clear. This documents defines a
   bandwidth modifier that does not include transport overhead, instead

   an additional packet rate attribute is defined. The transport
   independent bit-rate value together with the packet rate can then be
   used to calculate the real bit-rate over the actually used transport.

3. Introduction

   Today the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [1] is used in several
   types of applications. The original application is session
   information and configuration for multicast sessions announced with
   Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [4]. SDP is also a vital
   component in media negotiation for the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) [5] by using the offer answer model [6]. The Real-Time
   Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [7] also makes use of SDP to declare what
   media and codec(s) a multi-media presentation consist of to the
   client.

3.1. The Bandwidth Attribute

   In SDP [1] there exist a bandwidth attribute, which has a modifier
   used to specify what type of bit-rate the value refers to. The
   attribute has the following form:

   b=<modifier>:<value>





Westerlund                  Standards Track                    [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT         Bandwidth modifier for SDP         Jan. 22, 2003


   Today there are four modifiers defined which are used for different
   purposes.

3.1.1. Conference Total

   The Conference Total is indicated by giving the modifier "CT". The
   meaning of Conference total is to give a maximum bandwidth that a
   conference session will use. Its purpose is to decide if this session
   can co-exist with any other sessions. Defined in RFC 2327 [1].

3.1.2. Application Specific Maximum

   The Application Specific maximum bandwidth is indicated by the
   modifier "AS". The interpretation of this attribute is depending on
   the application's notion of maximum bandwidth. For an RTP application
   this attribute is the RTP session bandwidth as defined in RFC 1889
   [8]. The session bandwidth includes the bandwidth that the RTP data
   traffic will result in, including the lower layers down to IP layer.
   So the bandwidth is in most cases calculated over RTP payload, RTP
   header, UDP and IP. Defined in RFC 2327 [1].

3.1.3. RTCP Report bandwidth

   Today there is a draft [9], currently in the RFC editors queue to
   become a Proposed Standard, which defines two new bandwidth
   modifiers. These modifiers "RS" and "RR", define the amount of
   bandwidth that is assigned for RTCP reports by active data senders
   respectively RTCP reports by receivers only.

3.2. IPv6 and IPv4

   Today there are two IP versions 4 [15] and 6 [14] used in parallel on
   the Internet. This creates problems and there exist a number of
   possible transition mechanisms.

     ------------------            ----------------------
     | IPv4 domain    |            | IPv6 Domain        |
     |                | ---------| |                    |
     | ----------     |-| NAT-PT |-|      ----------    |
     | |Server A|     | ---------| |      |Client B|    |
     | ----------     |            |      ----------    |
     ------------------            ----------------------

     Figure 1. Translation between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.

   -  To achieve connectivity between an IPv4 only host and an IPv6
      only host, translation is necessary. This translator can be for
      example Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation (NAT-
      PT) [13], see Figure 1. However to get connectivity for large
      number of protocols, Application Level Gateway (ALG) functionality
      is also required at the node. To be able to locate hosts through

INTERNET-DRAFT         Bandwidth modifier for SDP         Jan. 22, 2003


      the translation node DNS ALG must be supported.

   -  IPv6 nodes belonging to different domains running IPv6, but
      lacking IPv6 connectivity between them solves this by tunneling
      over the IPv4 net, see Figure 2. Basically the IPv6 packets are
      put as payload in IPv4 packets between the tunneling end-points at
      the edge of each IPv6 domain.


     ---------------  ---------------  ---------------
     | IPv6 domain |  | IPv4 domain |  | IPv6 Domain |
     |             |  |-------------|  |             |
     | ----------  |--||Tunnel     ||--| ----------  |
     | |Server A|  |  |-------------|  | |Client B|  |
     | ----------  |  |             |  | ----------  |
     ---------------  ---------------  --------------|

     Figure 2. Tunneling through a IPv4 domain

   IPv4 has minimal header size of 20 bytes. While the fixed part of the
   IPv6 header is 40 bytes.

   The difference in header sizes, results in that the bit-rate required
   for a certain IP layer is different. How big the difference is,
   depends on the packet rate and size difference of each packet.

4. The Bandwidth Signaling Problems

   When an application wants to use SDP to signal the bandwidth required
   for this application some problems becomes evident depending on the
   transport layers.

4.1. What IP version is used

   If one signals the bandwidth in SDP, with for example "b=AS:" for an
   RTP based application, one cannot know if the overhead is calculated
   for IPv4 or IPv6. An indication to which protocol has been used when
   calculating the bandwidth values is given by the "c=" connection data
   line. This line contains either a multicast group address or a
   unicast address of the data source or sink. The "c=" lines address
   type may be assumed to be of the same type as the one used in the
   bandwidth calculation. There seems to exist no specification pointing
   this out.

   In cases of SDP transported by RTSP this is even less clear. The
   normal usage for a unicast on-demand streaming session is to set the
   connection data address to a null address. This null address does
   have an address type, which could be used as an indication. However
   this is also not clarified anywhere.





Westerlund                  Standards Track                    [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT         Bandwidth modifier for SDP         Jan. 22, 2003


   Figure 1, illustrates a connection scenario between a streaming
   server A and a client B over a translator here designated as a NAT-
   PT. When B receives the SDP from A over RTSP it will be very
   difficult for B to know what the bandwidth values in the SDP
   represent. The following possibilities exist:

   1. The SDP is unchanged and "c=" null address is of type IPv4. The
      bandwidth value represents the bandwidth needed in an IPv4
      network.
   2. The SDP has been changed by the ALG. The "c=" address is changed
      to IPv6 type. The bandwidth value is unchanged.
   3. The SDP is changed and both "c=" address type and bandwidth value
      is changed. Unfortunately, this can seldom be done, see 4.2.

   In case 1 the client can understand that the server is located in an
   IPv4 network and that it uses IPv4 overhead when calculating the
   bandwidth value. The client can almost never convert the bandwidth
   value, see section 4.2.

   In case 2 the client does not know that the server is in an IPv4
   network and that the bandwidth value is not calculated with IPv6
   overhead. In cases where a client reserve bandwidth for this flow,
   too little will be reserved, potentially resulting in bad Quality of
   Service (QoS).

   In case 3 everything works correctly. However this case will be very
   rare. If one tries to convert the bandwidth value without further
   information about the packet rate significant errors may be
   introduced into the value.

4.2. Converting bandwidth values

   If one would like to convert a bandwidth value calculated using IPv4
   overhead to IPv6 overhead the packet rate is required. The new
   bandwidth value for IPv6 is normally "IPv4 bandwidth" + "packet rate"
   * 20 bytes. Where 20 bytes is the usual difference between IPv6 and
   IPv4 headers. The overhead difference may be other in cases when IPv4
   options [15] or IPv6 extension headers [14] are used.

   As converting requires the packet rate of the stream, this is not
   possible in the general case. Many codecs has many possible packet
   rates. Therefore some extra information in the SDP will be required.
   The "a=ptime:" parameter may be a possible candidate. However this
   parameter is normally only used for audio codecs. Also its definition
   [1] is that it is only a recommendation, which the sender may
   disregard from. A better parameter is needed.

4.3. Header Compression

   Another mechanism that alters the actual overhead over links is
   header compression. Header compression uses the fact that most



Westerlund                  Standards Track                    [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT         Bandwidth modifier for SDP         Jan. 22, 2003


   network protocol headers have either static or predictable values in
   their fields within a packet stream. Compression is normally only
   done on per hop basis, i.e. on a single link. The normal reason for
   doing header compression is that the link has fairly limited
   bandwidth and significant gain in throughput is achieved.

   There exist a couple of different header compression standard. For
   compressing IP headers only, there exist RFC 2507 [10]. For
   compressing packets with IP/UDP/RTP headers, CRTP [11] was created at
   the same time. More recently the Robust Header Compression (ROHC)
   working group has been developing a framework and profiles [12] for
   compressing certain combinations of protocols, like IP/UDP,
   IP/UDP/RTP.

   When using header compression the actual used overhead will be less
   deterministic, but in most cases an average overhead can be
   determined for a certain application. If a network node knows that
   some type of header compression is employed this can taken into
   consideration. To be able to do this with any accuracy the
   application and packet rate is needed.

4.4. RTCP problems

   When RTCP is used between host in IPv4 and IPv6 networks over an NAT-
   PT, similar problems exist. The RTCP traffic going from the IPv4
   domain will result in a higher RTCP bit-rate than intended in the
   IPv6 domain due to the larger headers. This may result in up to 25%
   increase in required bandwidth for the RTCP traffic. The largest
   increase will be for small RTCP packets when the number of IPv4 hosts
   is much larger than the number of IPv6 hosts. Fortunately as RTCP has
   a limited bandwidth compared to RTP it will only result in a maximum
   of 1.75% increase of the total session bandwidth when RTCP bandwidth
   is 5% of RTP bandwidth. The RTCP randomization may easily result in
   short term effects of the same magnitude. The increase in bandwidth
   will in most cases be less.

   At the same time this results in unfairness in the reporting between
   an IPv4 and IPv6 node. The IPv6 node may report in the worst case
   with 25% longer intervals.

   These problems have been considered insignificant enough to not be
   worth any complex solutions. Therefore only a simple algorithm for
   deriving RTCP bandwidth is defined.

4.5. Future development

   Today there is work in IETF to design a new datagram transport
   protocol, which will be suitable to use for real-time media. This
   protocol is called the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).
   This protocol will most probably have another header size than UDP,




Westerlund                  Standards Track                    [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT         Bandwidth modifier for SDP         Jan. 22, 2003


   which is mostly used today. This results in even further numbers of
   possible transport combinations to calculate overhead for.

5. Problem Scope

   The problems described in chapter 4 does effect all the protocols
   that uses SDP to signal bandwidth parameters including transport
   level bit-rates.

   In the MMUSIC WG there is work on a replacement of SDP called SDP-NG.
   That work is RECOMMENDED to consider the problems outlined in this
   draft when designing solutions for specifying bandwidth in SDP-NG.

6. Requirements

   A solution to the problems outlined in this draft should meet the
   following requirements:

   - The bandwidth value SHALL be given in a way so that it can be
      calculated for all possible combinations of transport overhead.

7. A Solution

7.1. Introduction

   This chapter describes a solution for the problems outlined in this
   document for the Application Specific (AS) bandwidth modifier.

   The CT is a session level modifier and cannot easily be dealt with.
   To address the problems with different overhead the CT value is
   RECOMMENDED to be calculated using reasonable worst case overhead.

   The RR and RS modifiers [9] will be used as defined and includes
   transport overhead. The small unfairness between hosts is deemed
   acceptable.

7.2. The TIAS bandwidth modifier

7.2.1. Usage

   A new bandwidth modifier is defined to be used for the following
   purposes:

   -  Resource reservation. A single bit-rate can be enough to use for
      resource reservation. Some characteristics can be derived from the
      stream, codec type, etc. In some cases more information is needed,
      then another SDP parameter will be required.

   -  Maximum media codec rate. With the definition below of "TIAS" the
      given bit-rate will mostly be from the media codec. Therefore it
      gives a good indication on the maximum codec bit-rate required to



Westerlund                  Standards Track                    [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT         Bandwidth modifier for SDP         Jan. 22, 2003


      be supported by the decoder.

   -  Communication bit-rate required for the stream. The "TIAS" value
      together with "maxprate" can be used to determine the maximum
      communication bit-rate the stream will require. By adding all
      maximum bit-rates from the streams in a session together, a
      receiver can determine if its communication resources are
      sufficient to handle the stream. For example a modem user can
      determine if the session fits his modems capabilities and the
      established connection.

   -  Determine the RTP session bandwidth and derive the RTCP
      bandwidth. The derived transport dependent attribute will be the
      RTP session bandwidth in case of RTP based transport. The TIAS
      value can also be used to determine the RTCP bandwidth to use when
      using implicit allocation. RTP [8] defines that if not explicitly
      stated, additional bandwidth shall be used by RTCP equal to 5% of
      the RTP session bandwidth. The RTCP bandwidth can be explicitly
      allocated by using the RR and RS modifiers defined in [9].

7.2.2. Definition

   A new session and media level bandwidth modifier is defined:

   b=TIAS:<bandwidth-value> ; see section 7.6 for ABNF definition.

   The Transport Independent Application Specific Maximum (TIAS)
   bandwidth modifier has an integer bit-rate value in bits per second.
   A fractional bandwidth value SHALL always be rounded up to the next
   integer. The bandwidth value is the maximum needed by the application
   (session level) or media stream (media level) without counting IP or
   transport layers. On session level the TIAS value is simply the sum
   of all media stream's TIAS value. For RTP based media streams, TIAS
   on media level can be used to derive the RTP "session bandwidth" as
   defined in section 6.2 of [8]. However in the context of RTP
   transport the TIAS value is defined as:

      Only the RTP payload with its media SHALL be used in the
      calculation of the bit-rate, i.e. the lower layers (IP/UDP) and
      RTP headers are excluded. This will allow one to use the same
      value for both RTP based media transport as non-RTP transport and
      stored media.

   Note 1: The usage of bps is not in accordance with RFC 2327 [1]. This
   change has no implications on the parser, only the interpreter of the
   value must be aware. The change is done to allow for better
   resolution, and has also been used for the RR and RS bandwidth
   modifiers see [9].

   Note 2: RTCP bandwidth is not included in the bandwidth value. In
   applications using RTCP, the bandwidth used by RTCP is either 5% of



Westerlund                  Standards Track                    [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT         Bandwidth modifier for SDP         Jan. 22, 2003


   the RTP session bandwidth including lower layers or as specified by
   the RR and RS modifiers [9]. A definition on how to derive the RTCP
   bit-rate when using TIAS is present in chapter 7.5.

7.2.3. Usage Rules

   "TIAS" is primarily intended to be used at media level. The TIAS
   bandwidth attribute MAY be present on session level in the SDP.
   However, if present at session level it SHOULD be present also on
   media level. "TIAS" SHALL NOT be present on session level, unless the
   same transport is used for all media streams. The session level value
   if present MUST be the sum of all media levels.

   To allow for backwards compatibility towards users of SDP that does
   not implement "TIAS", it is RECOMMENDED to also include the "AS"
   modifier when using "TIAS". The presence of any value, even with
   problems is better than none. However an SDP user understanding TIAS
   when present SHOULD ignore the "AS" value and use TIAS instead.

   When using TIAS for an RTP transported stream(s) the "maxprate"
   attribute SHALL be included at the corresponding SDP level.

7.3. Packet Rate parameters

   To be able to calculate the bandwidth value including the actually
   used lower layers, a packet rate attribute is also defined.

   The session and media level maximum packet rate attribute is defined
   as:

   a=maxprate:<packet-rate> ; see section 7.6 for ABNF definition.

   The <packet-rate> is a floating-point value for the streams maximum
   packet rate. If the number of packets is variable the given value
   SHALL be the maximum the application, can produce in case of live
   stream, or for on-demand streams, have produced. The packet rate is
   calculated by adding together the number of packets sent within a 1
   second long window. The maxprate is the largest value produced when
   the window is slide over the entire media stream. In cases that this
   can't be calculated, i.e. for example a live stream, a estimated
   value of the maximum rate the codec can produce for the given
   configuration and content SHALL be used.

   A session level value MUST be the sum of all media level packet
   rates. The session level value MAY only be given if all media streams
   uses the same transport. If that is not the case, the "maxprate"
   attribute MUST NOT be present at session level. If given at session
   level it SHOULD also be given at media level.

   "maxprate" SHOULD be included for all transports where a packet rate
   can be derived and TIAS is included.

INTERNET-DRAFT         Bandwidth modifier for SDP         Jan. 22, 2003


7.4. Converting to Transport Dependent values

   When converting the transport independent bit-rate value (bw-value)
   into a transport dependent value including the lower layers the
   following MUST be done:

   1. Determine which lower layers that will be used and calculate the
      sum of the sizes of the headers in bits (h-size). In cases of
      variable header sizes the average size SHOULD be used.
   2. Retrieve the maximum packet rate from the SDP (prate = maxprate).
   3. Calculate the transport overhead by multiplying the header sizes
      with the packet rate (t-over = h-size * prate).
   4. Round the transport overhead up to nearest integer in bits(t-over
      = CEIL(t-over)).
   5. Add the transport overhead to the transport independent bit-rate
      value (bit-rate = bw-value + t-over)

   When the above calculation is performed using the "maxprate" the bit-
   rate value will be the absolute maximum the media stream will use
   over the transport used in the calculations.

7.5. Deriving RTCP bandwidth

   This chapter does not solve the fairness and possible bit-rate change
   introduced by IPv4 to IPv6 translation. These differences are
   considered small enough and a solution introduces code changes to the
   RTP/RTCP implementation. This chapter gives only a consistent way of
   calculating the bit-rate to assign to RTCP if not explicitly given.

   First the transport dependent RTP session bit-rate is calculated, in
   accordance with chapter 7.4, using the actual transport layers used
   at this end point. The RTCP bit-rate is then derived as usual based
   on the RTP session bandwidth, i.e. normally equal to 5% of the
   calculated value.

7.5.1. Motivation to being an acceptable solution.

   Giving the exact same bit-rate value to both the IPv4 and IPv6 host
   will result in that the IPv4 host has a higher RTCP sending rate. For
   a 100 bytes RTCP packet (including UDP/IPv4) the IPv4 sender has
   approximate 20 % higher rate. This rate falls with larger RTCP
   packets. For example, 300 bytes packets will only give the IPv4 host
   a 7% higher reporting rate.

   The above rule for deriving RTCP bandwidth, gives the same behavior
   as fixed assignment when the RTP session has traffic parameters
   giving a large TIAS/maxprate ratio. The two hosts will be fair when
   the TIAS/maxprate ratio is approximate 40 (bytes/packet) given 100
   bytes RTCP packets. For a TIAS/maxprate ratio of 5 bytes/packet the
   IPv6 host will be allowed to send approximately 15-20 % more RTCP

   packets. The larger the RTCP packets become the more it will favor
   the IPv6 host in sending rate.

   The conclusions is that the within the normal useful combination of
   transport independent bit-rates and packet rates the difference in
   fairness between a host on different IP versions with different
   overhead is acceptable. For the 20 bytes difference in overhead
   between IPv4 and IPv6 headers the actually used RTCP bandwidth in a
   unicast connection case will not be larger than approximately 1% of
   the total session bandwidth.

7.6. ABNF definitions

   This chapter defines in ABNF from RFC 2234 [2] the bandwidth modifier
   and the packet rate attribute.

   The bandwidth modifier:

   TIAS-bandwidth-def = "b" "=" "TIAS" ":" bandwidth-value

   bandwidth-value = 1*DIGIT

   The maximum packet rate attribute:

   max-p-rate-def = "a" "=" "maxprate" ":" packet-rate CRLF

   packet-rate = 1*DIGIT ["." 1*DIGIT]


8. Protocol Interaction

8.1. RTSP

   The "TIAS", and "maxprate" can today be used with RTSP. To be able to
   calculate the transport dependent bandwidth, some of the transport
   header parameters will be required. There should be no problems for a
   client to calculate the required bandwidth(s) prior to a RTSP SETUP.
   The reason is that a client supports a limited number of transport
   setups. The one actually offered a server in a SETUP request will be
   dependent on the contents of the SDP description. The "m=" line will
   signal to the client the desired transport profile(s).

8.2. SIP

   The usage of "TIAS" together with "maxprate" should not be different
   from the handling of the "AS" modifier currently in use. The needed
   transport parameters will available in the transport field in the
   "m=" line. The address class can be determined from the "c=" field
   and the clients connectivity.

8.3. SAP

   In the case of SAP all available information to calculate the
   transport dependent bit-rate should be present in the SDP. The "c="
   information gives the used address family for the multicast. The
   transport layer, e.g. RTP/UDP, for each media is evident in the media
   line ("m=") and its transport field.

9. Security Consideration

   The bandwidth value that is supplied by the parameters defined here
   can, if not protected, be altered. By altering the bandwidth value
   one can fool a receiver to reserve either more or less bandwidth than
   actually needed. Reserving too much may result in unwanted expenses
   on behalf of user and also blocking of resources that other parties
   could have used. If to little bandwidth is reserved the receiving
   users quality MAY be effected. Trusting a to large TIAS value may
   also result in that the receiver will turn down the session due to
   insufficient communication and decoding resources.

   Due to these security risks it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that the SDP
   is authenticated so no tampering can be performed. It is also
   RECOMMENDED that any receiver of the SDP performs an analysis of the
   received bandwidth values so that they are reasonable and is what can
   be expected for the application. For example an single channel AMR
   encoded voice stream claiming to use 1000 kbps is not reasonable.

10. IANA Consideration

   This document register one new SDP session and media level attribute
   "maxprate", see section 7.3.

   A new SDP [1] bandwidth modifier (bwtype) "TIAS" is also registered
   in accordance with the rules requiring a standard tracks RFC. The
   modifier is defined in section 7.2.
