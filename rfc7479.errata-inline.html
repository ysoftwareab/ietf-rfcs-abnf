1.  Introduction

   The Ed25519 [Ed25519] signature algorithm, specifically
   Ed25519-SHA-512, has been implemented in OpenSSH.  RFC 4255 [RFC4255]
   defines a DNS resource record, &quot;SSHFP&quot;, which can be used to publish
   a fingerprint of the SSH server public key in the DNS.  This document
   updates the IANA &quot;SSHFP RR Types for public key algorithms&quot; registry
   by adding an algorithm number for Ed25519 [Ed25519].

2.  Ed25519 Public Key with SHA-256 Fingerprint

   The encoding of Ed25519 public keys is described in [Ed25519].  In
   brief, an Ed25519 public key is a 32-octet value representing a
   255-bit y-coordinate of an elliptic curve point, and a sign bit
   indicating the corresponding x-coordinate.

   The SSHFP Resource Record for the Ed25519 public key with SHA-256
   fingerprint [FIPS180-4] would, for example, be:

      <span class="Verified-inline-styling" id='inline-4328'> <button id="btn_4328" target="expand_4328" onclick='hideFunction("expand_4328")'>Expand</button>
    ssh.example.com. IN SSHFP 4 2 ( a87f1b687ac0e57d2a081a2f2826723
                                     34d90ed316d2b818ca9580ea384d924
                                     01 )</span id__locate=4328>
<div class="nodeCloseClass" id='expand_4328'><div class='Verified-endnote-styling' id='eid4328'>
<pre>
<b><i><a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid4328'>EID 4328</a> (Verified) is as follows:</i></b>

<b>Section:</b> 2

<b>Original Text:</b>


    ssh.example.com IN SSHFP 4 2 ( a87f1b687ac0e57d2a081a2f2826723
                                     34d90ed316d2b818ca9580ea384d924
                                     01 )

<b>Corrected Text:</b>


    ssh.example.com. IN SSHFP 4 2 ( a87f1b687ac0e57d2a081a2f2826723
                                     34d90ed316d2b818ca9580ea384d924
                                     01 )
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br/>
<br/>There was a missing &quot;.&quot; after .com<br/><br/>Otherwise, the name server will complete the relative name, with unexpected results. (Yes, I know, it depends on how the $ORIGIN is set. Nevertheless, it is strange.)
</div>
</div>
   The following body of the public key file was used as input to
   generate the above fingerprint:

    ssh-ed25519
    AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGPKSUTyz1HwHReFVvD5obVsALAgJRNarH4TRpNePnAS

   The opaque octet string output produced is placed as is in the RDATA
   fingerprint field.

3.  Security Considerations

   The overall security of using SSHFP for SSH host key verification is
   dependent on the security policies of the SSH host administrator and
   DNS zone administrator (in transferring the fingerprint), detailed
   aspects of how verification is done in the SSH implementation, and in
   the client&#x27;s diligence in accessing the DNS in a secure manner.
   Please refer to RFC 4255 [RFC4255] for a discussion of the security
   considerations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has added the following entry to the &quot;SSHFP RR Types for public
   key algorithms&quot; registry:

      +--------+-------------+------------+
      | Value  | Description |  Reference |
      +--------+-------------+------------+
      |   4    |    Ed25519  | [RFC7479]  |
      +--------+-------------+------------+
