Abstract

   This document describes a new resource record for DNS.  This record
   may be used to store public keys for use in IPsec systems.

   This record replaces the functionality of the sub-type #1 of the KEY
   Resource Record, which has been proposed to be obsoleted by [1].

1. Introduction

1.1 Overview

   Overview.
2. Storage formats

   The IPSECKEY resource record (RR) is used to publish a public key
   that is to be associated with a Domain Name System (DNS) name.  It
   will be a public key as only public keys are stored in the DNS.  This
   can be the public key of a host, network, or application (in the case
   of per-port keying).

   An IPSECKEY RR is, like any other RR, authenticated by a SIG RR.

   It is expected that there will often be multiple resource records of
   the IPSECKEY type.  This will be due to the need to rollover keys,
   and due to the presence of multiple gateways.

   The type number for the IPSECKEY RR is 44 (IANA TBD).
3. IPSECKEY RDATA format

Internet-Draft                   ipsecrr                    January 2003


   The RDATA for an IPSECKEY RR consists of a precedence value, a public
   key (and algorithm type), and an optional gateway address.

                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

3.1 RDATA format - gateway type

   The gateway type ("gtype") field indicates the format of the gateway
   field.  The gateway field may be absent.

   0  No gateway field is present

   1  A 32-bit IPv4 address is present in the gateway field, in section

   2  A 128-bit IPv6 address is present in the gateway field.  The data
      portion is an IPv6 address as described in section 3.2 of [4].
      This is a 128-bit number in network byte order.

   3  A fully qualified domain name is present in the gateway field.
      The name a %lt;domain-name%gt; encoded as described in section 3.3
      of [4].  This field occupies the space until the end of the RDATA.


3.2 RDATA format - algo type

   The algorithm type ("algo") field indicates the type of key that is
   present in the public key field.  Valid values are:

   0  No key is present.

   1  A RSA key is present, in the format defined in

   2  A DSA key is present, in the format defined in

3.3 RDATA format - precedence

   This is an 8-bit precedence for this record.  This is interpreted in

   a similar way to the PREFERENCE field described in section 3.3.9 of
   [3].

3.4 RDATA format - RSA public key

   If the algorithm type has the value 1, then public key portion
   contains an RSA public key, encoded as described in secion 2 of [7],
   and repeated here:

                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | pub exp length|        public key exponent                    /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               /
      +-                           modulus                            /
      |                                                               /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-/

   RFC2065 limited the exponent and modulus to 2552 bits in length, and
   RFC3110 to 4096 bits.  No such limit is specified here for the
   purposes of encoding and decoding.  The length in octets of the
   public exponent length is represented as one octet if it is in the
   range of 1 to 255 and by a zero octet followed by a two octet
   unsigned length if it is longer than 255 bytes.  The public key
   modulus field is a multiprecision unsigned integer.  The length of
   the modulus can be determined from the RDLENGTH and the preceding
   RDATA fields including the exponent.

   Leading zero bytes are prohibited in the exponent and modulus.

3.5 RDATA format - DSA public key

   If the algorithm type has the value 2, then public key portion
   contains an DSA public key, encoded as described in [6].
4. Presentation formats

4.1 File Representation of IPSECKEY RRs

   IPSECKEY RRs may appear as lines in a zone data master file.  The
   precedence field is mandatory.  While both the gateway and public key
   fields are optional, it is illegal for neither to be present.

   As the IPv4, IPv6 and FQDN references to the gateway are mutually
   exclusive, they can share a position.  If no gateway is to be
   indicated, then the special tokens of either "-" or "none" may be
   used.
