Abstract

   This document identifies scenarios where existing IP spoofing
   approaches for detection and mitigation don't perform perfectly.
   Exsiting SAV (source address validation) approaches, either Ingress
   ACL filtering [RFC2827], unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF)
   [RFC3704], Feasible Path uRPF [RFC 3704], or Enhanced Feasible-Path
   uRPF [RFC8704] has limitations regarding eihter automated
   implemetation objective or detection accuracy objective (0% false
   positive and 0% false negative).  This document provides the gap
   analysis of the exsting SAV approaches, and also provides solution
   discussions.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Source Address Validation

   The Internet is open to traffic, which means that a sender can
   generate traffic and send to any receiver in the Internet as long as
   the address is reachable.  Although this openness design improves the
   scalability of the Internet, it also leaves security risks, e.g., a
   sender can forge the source address when sending the packets, which
   is also known as IP spoofing.  IP spoofing is constantly used in
   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which seriously compromise network
   security.  DOS attacks using IP spoofing makes it difficult for
   operators to locate the attacker's actual source address.  [RFC6959]
   identifies different types of DOS attacks with IP spoofing, i.e.,
   single-packet attack, flood-based DoS, poisoning attack, spoof-based

   worm/malware propagation, reflective attack, accounting subversion,
   man-in-the-middle attack, third-party recon, etc.

1.2.  Existing SAV Techniques Overview

   Source address validation (SAV) verifies the authenticity of the
   packet's source address to detect and mitigate IP spoofing [RFC2827].
   Existing methods, such as Source Address Validation Improvement
   (SAVI) [RFC7039], unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) (i.e.,
   Strict uRPF, Feasible uRPF and Loose uRPF) [RFC3704], as well as
   Enhanced Feasible-Path Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (EFP-uRPF)
   methods [RFC8704] are deployed at different network levels to prevent
   IP spoofing.

   Overall, when evaluating a SAV technique, one should consider the
   following two perspectives.

   1) Precise filtering: Two important indicators for precise filtering.
      1) 0% false positive (FP) rate.  If legitimate packets are
      dropped, it can seriously affect the user experience.  2) 0% false
      negative (FN) rate.  If some packets with a forged source address
      passes, it poses potential security risks.

   2) Automatic implementation: In practice, the address space may grow,
      and routing policies may be dynamically adjusted.  SAV solutions
      that rely entirely on manual configuration are either non-scalable
      or error-prone.

   SAVI, typically performed at the access network, is enforced in
   switches, where the mapping relationship between an IP address and
   other "trust anchor" is maintained.  A "trust anchor" can be link-
   layer information (such as MAC address), physical port of a switch to
   connect a host, etc.  It enforces hosts to use legitimate IP source
   addresses.  However, given numerous access networks managed by
   different operators, it is far from practice for all the access
   networks to simultaneously deploy SAVI.  Therefore, in order to
   mitigate the security risks raised by source address spoofing, SAV
   performed in network border routers is also necessary.  Although it
   does not provide the same filtering granualarity as SAVI does, it
   still helps the tracing of spoofing to a minimized network range.

   Ingress ACLs [RFC2827], typically performed at the network border
   routers, is performed by manually maintaining a traffic filtering
   access list which contains acceptable source address for each
   interface.  Only packets with a source address encompassed in the
   access list can be accepted.  It strictly specifies the source
   address space of incoming packets.  However, manual-based filtering
   method is error-prone and face scalability issues.

   Strict uRPF, typically performed at the network (IGP areas or ASes)
   border routers, requires that a data packet can be only accepted when
   the FIB contains a prefix that encompasses the source address and the
   corresponding out-interface matches the data incoming interface.  It
   has the advantages of simple operation, easy deployment, and
   automatic update.  However, in case of multihoming, when the data
   imcoming interface is different from the out-interface, which is also
   refered to as asymmetric routing of data packets, Strict uRPF exibits
   FP.

   Loose uRPF, sacrificing the directionality of Strict uRPF, only
   requires that the packet's source IP exists as a FIB entry.
   Intuitively, Loose uRPF cannot prevent the attacker from forging a
   source address that already exists in the FIB, which incurs FN
   detection.

   Feasible uRPF (FP-uRPF), typically performed at the network border
   routers, helps mitigate FP of Strict uRPF in the multihoming
   scenarios.  Instead of installing only the best route into FIB as
   Strict uRPF does, Feasible uRPF installs all alternative paths into
   the FIB.  It helps reduce FP filtering compared with the Strict uRPF,
   in the case when multiple paths are learnt from different interfaces.
   However, it should be noted that Feasible uRPF only works when
   multiple paths are learnt.  There are cases when a device only learns
   one path but still has packets coming from other valid interfaces.
   Thus, FP-uRPF performs better than Loose uRPF regarding FP detection,
   but still doesn't not guarantee 0% FP.

   EFP-uRPF, specifically performed at the AS border routers, further
   improves FP-uRPF in the inter-AS scenario.  An ASBR, performing EFP-
   uRPF, maintains an RPF filtering list on each customer/peer
   interface.  It introduces two algorihtms (i.e., Algorithm A and
   Algorithm B) regarding different application scenarios.  In the case
   that a customer interface fails to learn any route from a directly
   connected customer AS, enabling Algorithm A at this customer
   interface may exibit false postive detection.  In this case,
   Algorithm B can mitigate the FP.  However, in case of two customer
   ASes spoofing each other, Algorithm B exibits FN.

   This document specifically identifies two scenarios, where the above
   mentioned SAV techniques, i.e., Strict uRPF, Loose uRPF, FP-uRPF, and
   EFP-uRPF, fail to guarantee 0% FP and 0% FN detection.

3.  Problem Statement

3.1.  Use Case 1: Inter-AS Multi-homing

   Figure 1 illustrates an inter-AS multihoming case.

   AS2 is multi-homed to AS1 and AS4.  AS2 announces P1/P2 to AS1
   through BGP.  AS2 doesn't announce any of its routes to AS4 due to
   policy control.  P1/P2 are propagated from AS1 to AS4 through BGP.

   AS3 is single-homed to AS4.  AS3 announces P3 to AS4 through BGP.
   AS4 propagates P3 to AS1 through BGP.

   Now suppose two data flows coming from AS2 to AS4: Flow 1 with source
   IP as P1, and Flow 2 with source IP as P3 (IP spoofing).  Using
   existing SAV methods at AS4, Flow 1 is supposed to be passed, while
   Flow 2 is supposed to be dropped.

   o  Loose uRPF: works for Flow 1, but fails for Flow 2.

   o  Strict uRPF: works for Flow 2, but fails for Flow 1 (the incoming
      interface does not match P1/P2's out-interface).

   o  FP-uRFP: works for Flow 2, but fails for Flow 1 (no feasible path
      for P1/P2 other than the best route exists).

   o  EFP-uRPF: works for Flow 1, but fails for Flow 2 using Algorithm
      B.  Works for Flow 2, but fails for Flow 1 when using Algorithm A.

3.2.  Use Case 2: Intra-AS Multi-homing

   Figure 2 illustrates an intra-AS multihoming case.  To facilitate
   management, one AS can be divided into several administrative domains
   (ADs) and managed by different inner groups.  In Figure 2, AD1 is the
   upper level compared to AD2 and AD3, meaning that AD2 or AD3 needs to
   connect through AD1 for external reachability (i.e., networks outside
   AD1).  For example, AD1 is the backbone of one national education
   network, while AD2 and AD3 are the campus networks of the two
   universities.

   Router 1 is multi-homed to Router 2 and Router 3.  No dynamic routing
   protocol set up between Router 1 and Router 2, as well as between
   Router 1 and Router 3.  In AD2, static routes to outside AD2 are
   configured on Router 1 with Router 3 as the next hop.  In AD1, static
   route to P1 is configured on Router 2 and static route to P2 is
   configured on Router 3, due to traffic control purpose.  Router 2 and
   Router 3 are connected with each other using ISIS or OSPF.

   Router 5 is single-homed to Router 3.  In AD3, static routes to
   outside AD3 are configured on Router 5 with Router 3 as the next hop.
   In AD1,static route to P3 is configured on Router 3 with Router 5 as
   the next hop.

   Now suppose two data flows coming from Router 1 to Router 3: Flow 1
   with source IP as P1, and Flow 2 with source IP as P3 (IP spoofing).
   Using existing SAV methods at Router 3, Flow 1 is supposed to be
   passed, while Flow 2 is supposed to be dropped.

4.  Solution Discussions

   Both EFP-uRPF and FP-uRPF try to achieve a balance between
   flexibility (Loose uRPF) and directionality (Strict uRPF).

   In the inter-AS multi-homing scenario, EFP-uRPF further improves FR-
   uRPF's directionality.  The key improvement of EFP-uRPF is that it
   synchronizes certain information between interfaces that share the
   same RPF filtering list, so as to construct an RPF list as
   comprehensive as possible, although [RFC8704] does not explicitly
   specify how the information is synchronized, e.g., what information,
   in which format and in which way.  In addition, the construction of
   RPF lists can be further augmented with data from Route Origin
   Authorization (ROA) [RFC6482], as well as Internet Routing Registry
   (IRR) data.  In fact, the global availability of ROA and IRR
   databeses provides a secondary information synchronization approach.
   However, EFP-uRPF still fails to achieve 0% FN and 0% FP in case of
   Figure 1.  Further infomration synchronization between interfaces
   might provide further improvement.

   The above description works similarly for the intra-AS scenario.
   Information synchronization is also required in order to achieve
   higher filtering accuracy.
