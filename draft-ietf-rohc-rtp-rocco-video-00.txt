Abstract

   The Robust Checksum-based header Compression [ROCCO] scheme is a
   header compression scheme designed to work over error prone channels.
   The scheme is adaptable to the characteristics of the link over which
   it is used and also to the properties of the packet streams it
   compresses.

   This document describes a number of ROCCO profiles designed for
   conversational video over error prone channels. The profiles compress
   the size of the IP/UDP/RTP header down to a minimum of 2 octets.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet and cellular telephony are two communication
   technologies that have become commonly used by the general public.
   With Internet, the general public now has the possibility to see
   video clips in form of news, sports and entertainment. Currently,
   this is true only if a fixed connection is used. If a cellular link
   is used for the connection, the lack of bandwidth is a big problem.
   Within a few years, several new cellular standards with larger
   bandwidth will be ready for traffic. This will improve the situation
   for video over cellular links but the bandwidth will still be
   restricted. The performance over the cellular link could be improved
   a lot with an effective and error robust header compression scheme.

   In the RObust Checksum-based header COmpression [ROCCO] draft, a
   robust header compression scheme for error prone channels is
   presented. The scheme is designed to handle packet losses both before
   and between the compression points. In the draft, profiles for IP-
   telephony are presented. The profiles compress the 40 octet
   IP/UDP/RTP headers down to a minimum size of 1 octet. Simulations
   show that the performance for these profiles is at least as good as
   with [CRTP] for error free channels while they outperform CRTP for
   error prone channels.

   This document is an addition to the [ROCCO] document and defines
   profiles for IP-video. The profiles are designed for conversational
   video with a fixed reference clock. The profiles can handle variable
   picture frame rate, where variable frame rate means that frames from
   the source are skipped to get the lower frame rate. The profile is
   also designed to handle bi-directionally predicted frames, B-frames,
   in the compressed packet, thus supporting non-conversational video as
   well.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   Header Compression profile

     A header compression profile is a specification of how to compress
     the headers of a certain kind of packet stream over a certain kind
     of link.

   Header compression CRC

     A CRC computed by the compressor and included in each compressed
     header.  Its main purpose is to provide a way for the decompressor
     to reliably verify the correctness of reconstructed headers. What
     values the CRC is computed over depends on the packet type it is
     included in and typically, it covers the original header.

   PCF

     Picture clock frequency. The picture framerate delivered from the
     picture source. Example: In a PAL system using only one field, the
     PCF 25 Hz.

   Timestamp delta

     The timestamp delta is the change in the timestamp value between
     two consecutive packets.


3.  Header compression profiles for video packet streams

   This section describes the video profiles of ROCCO. A number of
   profiles are defined providing support for both IPv6 [Ipv6] and IPv4
   [Ipv4] in combination with various functionality.

3.1.  Usage scenarios, environment and requirements

   These profiles are optimized for conversational IP-video over
   cellular links with high error rates. The profiles are designed to
   successfully handle loss of several consecutive packets over the
   link, without introducing any additional loss. Packet type
   identification is included in all profiles which means that such
   functionality SHOULD NOT be provided by the link layer used.
   Regarding packet stream separation, various profiles are defined
   supporting different numbers of concurrent streams.
   As a cellular link with similar characteristics is expected at the
   other end of the connection, the profiles are also designed to handle
   some consecutive lost packets before the compression point without




Martensson, Einarsson, Jonsson                                  [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT    ROCCO Conversational Video Profiles      May 24, 2000


   increasing the size of the compressed header. The profiles are also
   designed to handle a single reordering of packets before the
   compression point, without increasing the size of the compressed
   header.

3.2.  Analysis of change patterns of header fields

   To design suitable mechanisms for efficient compression of all header
   fields, their change patterns need to be analyzed. For this reason,
   an extended classification specialized on conversational IP-video
   packet streams is made, which applies to all profiles defined in this
   document. This classification is based on the general classification
   in ROCCO [ROCCO], and considers the fields which were classified as
   CHANGING in that classification. These fields are further separated
   into five different subclasses:

   STATIC               These are fields that were classified as
                        CHANGING on a general basis, but are classified
                        as STATIC for IP-telephony packet streams.

   SEMISTATIC           These fields are STATIC most of the time.
                        However, occasionally the value changes but
                        returns to its original value after a known
                        number of packets.

   (R)ARELY-(C)HANGING  These are fields that changes their values
                        occasionally and then keep their new values.

   ALTERNATING          These fields have a few different values which
                        they are alternating between.

   IRREGULAR            These are the fields for which no useful change
                        pattern can be identified.

   To further expand the classification possibilities without making it
   more complex, the classification can be done either on the values of
   the field and/or on the values of the deltas for the field.

   When the classification is done, something should finally be stated
   regarding possible additional knowledge about the field values and/or
   field deltas, according to the classification. For fields classified
   as STATIC or SEMISTATIC, the case may be that the value of the field
   is not only STATIC but also well KNOWN a priori (two states for
   SEMISTATIC fields). For fields with non-irregular change behaviors,
   it may be known that changes use to be within a LIMITED scope
   compared to the maximal change for the field. For others, the values
   are completely UNKNOWN.

   Table 3.1 classifies all the CHANGING fields based on their expected
   change patterns for IP-telephony streams.

           Table 3.1 : Classification of CHANGING header fields

   The only fields that differ from the speech profile of ROCCO defined
   in [ROCCO] are the RTP marker and the RTP Timestamp. The following
   subsection discusses these fields in detail. For a detailed
   discussion about the other fields, please see [ROCCO]. Note that
   table 3.1 and the discussions below do not consider changes caused by
   loss or reordering before the compression point.

3.2.1.  RTP Marker

   The marker bit should be set for the last packet of every picture,
   which means that it has an alternating characteristic with well known
   values for both states.

INTERNET-DRAFT    ROCCO Conversational Video Profiles      May 24, 2000


3.2.2.  RTP Timestamp

   The change in RTP timestamp between two packets with successive
   sequence numbers will either be zero or increase by a multiple of a
   fixed value corresponding to the picture clock frequency. The
   timestamp can also decrease with a multiple of the fix value if B-
   pictures are used. The delta interval expressed as a multiple of the
   picture clock frequency is in most cases very limited.


3.3.  Profile definitions

   This document defines a number of different header compression
   profiles. The definitions are built up of requirements and
   capabilities of each profile in combination with information about
   which mechanisms that are used to implement the desired behaviors.

3.3.1.  List of defined profiles

   All defined profiles are listed in Table 3.2 together with their
   characteristics and pointers to implementation details that may
   differ from profile to profile.

   The first six columns state requirements and capabilities of the
   profiles. The meaning of the columns are:

   Nr

     This is the identification number for each profile. These numbers
     are used when negotiating profiles in the header compression setup
     phase. These numbers are preliminary and will perhaps change in
     coming versions of this draft.

   IPv

     This is the IP version for which the profile is designed. Possible
     values for this column are 6 and 4.

   Str

     This column gives the number of concurrent packet streams that are
     supported by the header compression profile.

   Chk

     This column indicates whether the profile supports packet streams
     with the UDP checksum (E)nabled or D(isabled).

INTERNET-DRAFT    ROCCO Conversational Video Profiles      May 24, 2000


   Id

     For profiles supporting IPv4, this column indicates which behavior
     of the IPv4 Identification field  the profile is optimized for.
     Possible values in this column are:

       (S)EQUENTIAL        These profiles can not handle streams with
                            IP Identification values assigned using any
                            other policy than sequential.

       (S)EQUENTIAL (J)UMP These profiles are recommended if the
                            Identification assignment is sequential
                            jump [ROCCO]. To signal the Identification,
                            the 8 least significant bits are sent which
                            means that the header size will increase
                            with one octet.

       (R)ANDOM            These profiles are recommended if it is
                            known that random assignment or sequential
                            jump is used. The Identification field will
                            be included "as-is" which means that the
                            header size will increase with two octets.

   MHS

     Minimal Header Size for the profile.

   The next three columns indicate how each profile is implemented. This
   includes header formats for STATIC (STA, chapter 3.5.2), DYNAMIC
   (DYN, chapter 3.5.3) and COMPRESSED (COM, chapter 3.5.4) packets.

3.3.2.  Additional, common profile characteristics

   In addition to what was stated in the left part of Table 3.1, all the
   profiles defined in this document applies to the following:

   Link layer requirements

     Except for the general link layer requirements (framing, length &
     profile negotiation) stated in [ROCCO], these profiles require also
     a reliable link layer CRC covering at least the header part of the
     packet. The CRC SHOULD ensure that packets with errors in the
     header part are never delivered.

   Packet stream characteristics

     These profiles are designed for packet streams carrying IP-video
     data.

   Pre link characteristics

     Several consecutive packet losses before the header compression
     point are for most of these profiles handled without introducing
     additional header overhead. Packet reordering on pre links is
     expected to be very uncommon.

   Link Characteristics

     The link over which header compression is performed is expected to
     have a loss characteristic that very seldom leads to loss of more
     than three consecutive packets.

INTERNET-DRAFT    ROCCO Conversational Video Profiles      May 24, 2000


   Variable frame rate

     The profiles are designed to handle variable picture frame rate,
     where variable frame rate means that picture frames from the source
     sequence are skipped to reach the new frame rate.

   Fixed video reference clock

     The profiles are designed to compress the IP/UDP/RTP headers more
     if a fixed video reference clock is used. This means that the RTP
     timestamp has to change with a multiple of a fixed value which
     corresponds to the used picture clock frequency or a multiple
     thereof if only every N'th picture is coded.


3.4.  Encoding of changing fields

   The analysis in section 3.2 excludes changes due to packet loss or
   reordering before the compression point. Such changes will have an
   impact on the regularity of the RTP sequence number, the RTP
   timestamp and, for Ipv4, the IP ID value. As described in [ROCCO] the
   IP ID value (if sequentially assigned) will follow the RTP timestamp.
   The task is then to communicate RTP sequence number and RTP timestamp
   information in some way.

   In the sequence number encoding, the sequence number modulo 7 is
   sent. In the timestamp encoding the RTP Timestamp is first divided by
   a delta Timestamp to decrease the change of the timestamp value
   between two packets and then a number of the least significant bits
   (LSB) is sent to the decoder. The Header Compression CRC computed
   over the original IP/UDP/RTP header is then used by the decompressor
   to verify the correctness of the decoding, i.e. that no wrap-around
   or loss of synchronization has occurred.

3.4.1.  Sequence number changes to handle

   The source increases the RTP sequence number with one for each
   packet. However, due to losses and reordering of packets on pre links
   the changes seen by the compressor may vary. The sequence number
   changes on the decompressor side may differ in that increase faster
   due to packet losses on the link between compressor and decompressor.

3.4.2.  Sequence number compression

   In the COMPRESSED base packet, three bits are used for the sequence
   number (SeqNr) encoding. However, one bitpattern combination (111)
   is reserved for packet type identification (see section 3.5.1). To
   use these seven sequence number code points in an effective way, the
   RTP sequence number is divided by 7:

     SeqNr = SEQR *7 + SEQ7

   where SEQ7 is the sequence number modulo 7 and SEQR is the integer
   part of the sequence number after division by 7.

   The SEQ7 value is sent in the first three bits in the COMPRESSED base
   header. It does not matter if the packet losses are before or after
   the compression point or a combination of the two.

   To be able to handle single reordering of packets before the
   compression point the seven code points SHOULD be interpreted in such
   a way that they cover the range [-1, 5] of sequence number change.
   This brings the possibility to lose up to 4 consecutive packets
   without losing the sequence number synchronization. It is possible to
   increase this range to cover larger sequence number jumps and to be
   even more robust to packet losses. A number of the least significant
   bits of SEQR can be sent in an extension to the COMPRESSED base
   packet. These bits SHOULD be interpreted in such a way that they
   cover the range [-3, (7*2^SEQR_NB)-4] of sequence number change,
   where SEQR_NB is the number of SEQR bits sent to the decompressor.
   The extended range may be used by the encoder to increase the
   probability of sustaining multiple packet losses on the link, when
   many packets are lost already before the compression point.

3.4.3.  Sequence number decompression

   The encoding and decoding of the received sequence number is done in
   the following way, where S(n) is the RTP sequence number to be
   encoded/decoded and S(n'-1) denotes the latest successfully decoded
   sequence number.

     Input sequence number: S(n)
     Encoded sequence number: SEQ7(n) = S(n) modulo 7
     Decoded sequence number: S(n') = S(n'-1) - S(n'-1) modulo 7 +
                                      S(n') modulo 7

   To handle modulo wrap-around, an additional verification is inserted.
   If the decoded sequence number S(n') is S(n'-1)-2 or smaller, S(n')
   is increased with 7. A mechanism to handle full-field wrap-around is
   also necessary and is presented in 3.4.4.

   If the extended sequence number range is used, it is necessary to
   take the SEQR bits into account when decoding the sequence number.

INTERNET-DRAFT    ROCCO Conversational Video Profiles      May 24, 2000



   Decoded sequence number: S(n') = S(n'-1) - SEQRLSB(n'-1) * 7
                                            - S(n'-1) modulo 7
                                            + SEQRLSB(n') * 7
                                            + S(n') modulo 7

   Where SEQR LSB are the least significant bits of SEQR. If no SEQR
   bits were sent for the preceding sequence number, the decoder has to
   calculate these to be able to correctly decode the sequence number.

   In this case, the modulo wrap-around test is changed to cover the new
   extended sequence number range in such a way that the sequence number
   delta is in the interval [-3, (7*2^SEQRLSB_NB)-4], where SEQR_NB is
   the number of SEQRLSB bits received by the decompressor.

   If the CRC fails in the decompressor one possible reason could be
   that a wrap-around of the SEQ7 field has occurred. In this case it is
   still possible to decode the sequence number if guesses are used.
   Please see [ROCCO] for a detailed description.

3.4.4  RTP Sequence Number wrap-around


   The SEQ7 and SEQRLSB will not change linearly during the RTP sequence
   number wrap-around. The changes of SEQ7 and SEQRLSB are as follows:


     SeqNr | SEQ7 | SEQRLSB(bin)
     ===========================
     65534 |   0  |   ...0010
     65535 |   1  |   ...0010
         0 |   0  |   ...0000
         1 |   1  |   ...0000

   Table 3.3 : Change of SEQ7 and SEQRLSB during a wrap-around

   During the RTP sequence number wrap-around the SEQ7 value will change
   from 1 to 0. If packet losses occur in connection to the wrap-around
   the probability that the sequence number is decoded wrong will
   increase. To avoid that, it is RECOMMENDED that the sequence number
   is either encoded with a DYNAMIC packet or with an extended range in
   an extension to the COMPRESSED packet. If extended range is used the
   following table shows how to interpret SEQ7 and SEQRLSB in the
   decoder during the wrap-around:

3.4.5.  Timestamp changes to handle

   All relevant video standards up to now uses a reference clock at
   90000 Hz [RFC2032]. For compression efficiency, it is assumed that
   the RTP timestamp changes with a multiple of a fix value, which
   corresponds to the current picture clock frequency (PCF) or a
   multiple thereof.

   The difference in timestamp compared to the packet with the preceding
   sequence number may be

   * 0, if the packet belongs to the same picture

   * > 0 and a multiple of the picture clock frequency for ordinary
   Intra(I) and Inter(P) pictures as well as B-pictures following B-
   pictures

   * < 0 and a multiple of the picture clock frequency for the first B-
   picture after an I or P picture

   The picture clock frequency used in H.261 [H.261] and H.263 ver.1
   [H.263v1] is 29.97 Hz which corresponds to a minimum timestamp
   increase between two coded pictures equal to 3003. For H.263 ver.2
   [H.263v2] and MPEG-4 [MPEG-4] one can use a custom picture clock
   frequency. Common frequencies are 25 Hz and 30 Hz which corresponds
   to an increase in timestamp of a multiple of 3600 and 3000,
   respectively.

   When packet losses occur either before or after the compression
   point, the increase of the timestamp will still be a multiple of the
   picture clock frequency. This property is used in the compression
   since it is sufficient to know how many PCF multiples the timestamp
   has increased.

   The change of Timestamp should be a multiple of the picture clock
   frequency and correlated with the video bitstream temporal reference
   according to [RFC2429]. This is the case we have assumed and it
   applies to many commercial codecs but not all. For the codecs that do




Martensson, Einarsson, Jonsson                                 [Page 13]

INTERNET-DRAFT    ROCCO Conversational Video Profiles      May 24, 2000


   not follow this scheme, the video profile still has the possibility
   to send the timestamp via extensions to the COMPRESSED header.

3.4.6.  Timestamp compression

   The change in RTP timestamp between two packets with successive
   sequence numbers will in most cases be zero or increase with a
   multiple of a fixed value. This value corresponds to the picture
   clock frequency used in the video encoder. If B-pictures are used it
   is also possible that the timestamp decreases between two pictures.
   To be able to handle these cases and also to tolerate some packet
   losses, some LSB of a downscaled timestamp are transmitted. The
   downscaling is done in the following way:

     TS = TSQ * PCTSI + TSR

   TS    = RTP timestamp
   PCTSI = Picture Clock Interval in TimeStamp ticks. Example: 3600
           for 25 Hz picture clock frequency (90000/25 = 3600).
   TSQ   = Timestamp quotient. The integer part after the division.
   TSR   = Timestamp residual. TSR = TS modulo PCTSI.

   If the change of timestamp between two packets is a multiple of
   PCTSI, the TSR will remain the same and only TSQ will change. To
   encode the TSQ, the five least significant bits are sent in the
   COMPRESSED base packet. If B-pictures are used or if there has been
   reordering of packets it is possible that the timestamp will decrease
   between two packets. To be able to handle these situations, the TSQ
   bits SHOULD be interpreted in such a way that they cover the range of
   delta TSQ corresponding to[-6, 25]. It is possible to increase this
   range to cover larger timestamp jumps. The extended range is done by
   sending more TSQ bits in an extension to the COMPRESSED packet. These
   extra bits SHOULD increase the range both upwards and downwards so
   they cover the range [-10, 2^(N+5)-11), where N is the number of TSQ
   bits sent in the COMPRESSED extension. The extended range is useful
   when the RTP Timestamp in the compression point has increased a lot
   from the last packet.

   Note: The least significant bits of the TSQ are sent in the
   COMPRESSED header while the extended bits are sent in the extension.

   Example: Assume that we have 5 TSQ bits in the COMPRESSED base header
   and an additional 2 TSQ bits in an extension. If we only have the
   five TSQ bits, it covers the range [-6, 25], but with the additional
   2 bits in the extension the range will be [-10, 117].

   The PCTSI is sent to the decompressor in the TS delta field either in
   the DYNAMIC packet or in an extension to the COMPRESSED packet.

   If the timestamp is not changing with a multiple of the current
   PCTSI, the update of the timestamp has to be done in a different way.




Martensson, Einarsson, Jonsson                                 [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT    ROCCO Conversational Video Profiles      May 24, 2000


   The timestamp can be sent in either an DYNAMIC packet or an extension
   to a COMPRESSED packet. If the COMPRESSED packet is used a number of
   the least significant bits of the timestamp (TS LSB) are sent in the
   extension. Since the TSQ bits are not useful when the timestamp is
   not changing with a multiple of the current PCTSI, the decompressor
   MUST discard these. It is RECOMMENDED that at least 21 TS LSB's are
   sent in the extension. To be able to handle situations with
   decreasing timestamp the TS LSB's SHOULD be interpreted in such a way
   that they cover the range of delta timestamp corresponding to [-2^16,
   2^TS_LSB_NB-2^16-1] from the last sent timestamp, where TS_LSB_NB is
   the size of the TS_LSB field in bits.

3.4.7.  Timestamp decompression

   The decompression of the RTP timestamp is done in a similar way as
   the RTP sequence number except that modulo seven is not used and that
   the TSQ values have to be upscaled with the timestamp delta. Assume
   that T(n) is the current RTP timestamp and TSQLSB is a number of
   least significant bits of TSQ.

     Decoded timestamp: T(n') = T(n'-1) - TSQLSB(n'-1) * timestamp delta
                                        + TSQLSB(n') * timestamp delta

   If the transmission of TSQLSB(n'-1) and TSQLSB(n') is not done with
   the same number of TSQ bits, the decoder has to recalculate
   TSQLSB(n'-1) to be of the same length as TSQLSB(n').

   To handle TSQLSB wrap-around, an additional verification is inserted.
   If TSQLSB(n') is TSQLSB(n'-1)-7 or smaller, T(n') is increased with
   2^NB, where NB is the number of bits used in the TSQLSB(n')
   transmission.

   If the CRC fails in the decompressor one possible reason could be
   that a wrap-around of the TSQ field has occurred. In this case it is
   still possible to decode the sequence number if guesses are used.
   Please see [ROCCO] for a detailed description.

3.4.8 RTP Timestamp wrap-around

   During a wrap-around of the RTP timestamp field it is possible that
   the TSQ range will be smaller. The reason to this is that the RTP
   timestamp is divided by the PCTSI and the five least significant bits
   of TSQ will probably not change from [11111] to [00000]. To increase
   the probability to decompress the RTP timestamp correctly it is
   RECOMMENDED to send the timestamp in either a DYNAMIC packet or in an
   extension to a COMPRESSED packet. If a COMPRESSED packet is used it
   is RECOMMENDED that at least 21 TS LSB's are used.
   Note: The TSR will probably change after the wrap-around and the
   compressor and the decompressor have to be aware of that.

INTERNET-DRAFT    ROCCO Conversational Video Profiles      May 24, 2000


3.4.9.  Change of Delta Timestamp

   When the Timestamp Delta is changed during a header compression
   session, both the new Timestamp Delta and the current timestamp MUST
   be sent to the decompressor. This can be done either by a DYNAMIC
   packet or a COMPRESSED packet with an extension.


3.5.  Header formats

   The profiles defined in this document makes use of four different
   packet types; STATIC, DYNAMIC, COMPRESSED and FEEDBACK. This section
   defines these packet types together with a description of how to use
   and identify them.

3.5.1.  Packet identification

   To identify the packet types, four bit patterns for the initial five
   bits of the first octet are reserved. These are:

   STATIC          11100
   DYNAMIC         1111*
   FEEDBACK        11101

   All other bit-patterns indicate a COMPRESSED packet format. The
   meaning of those patterns are defined together with the specification
   of the packet formats.

3.5.2.  Static information packet, initialization

   The STATIC packet type is a packet containing no payload but only the
   header fields that are expected to be constant within the lifetime of
   the packet stream (classified as STATIC in chapter 3.2). The
   identification of the STATIC packet is done by the first five bits in
   the first octet. A packet of this kind MUST be sent once as the first
   packet from compressor to decompressor and also when requested by
   decompressor (see 3.5.6 and 3.7). The packet formats are shown below
   for IPv6 and IPv4, respectively. Note that some fields are only
   present in some of the STATIC packet types.0

   All fields except for the initial five bits, the padding bits(-), the
   Context Identifier and the Header Compression CRC are the ordinary
   IP, UDP and RTP fields (F=IPv4 May Fragment, P=RTP Padding, E=RTP
   Extension). The Header Compression CRC is calculated over the entire
   STATIC packet except the Header Compression field itself. The Header
   Compression CRC SHOULD be used in the decompressor to verify that the
   packet is correct. For more information please see [ROCCO].

   Only one STATIC packet is sent at each occasion. If the decompressor
   receives DYNAMIC packets or compressed headers without having
   received a STATIC packet, the decompressor MUST request a STATIC
   packet.

3.5.3.  Dynamic information packet

   The DYNAMIC packet type has a header containing all changing header
   fields in their original, uncompressed form, and carries a payload
   just as ordinary COMPRESSED packets. A DYNAMIC packets SHOULD be sent
   after the initial STATIC packet to set up the decompressor context
   for the first time. In addition, this packet is used whenever the

   header fields change in a way that cannot be encoded in COMPRESSED
   packets.

   All fields except for the initial four bits, the Timestamp Delta ,
   the Context Identifier and the Header Compression CRC are ordinary
   IP, UDP and RTP fields. The Timestamp Delta is the current delta
   between RTP timestamps in consecutive RTP packets. If the Timestamp
   Delta is not known it SHOULD be initialized to 0. For information

   Each time a DYNAMIC packet is sent, several subsequent packets SHOULD
   also by DYNAMIC packets. This ensures that the update will succeed
   even when three consecutive packets are lost.

3.5.4.  Compressed packets

   The COMPRESSED packet type is the most commonly used one and it is
   designed to handle ordinary changes as efficiently as possible. When
   changes are regular, all information is carried in the base header.
   When changes are irregular it is possible to send more information in
   extensions to the COMPESSED packet. These extensions are sent after
   the whole base header, i.e. after the Identification field if it is
   present.

   The base header consists of five parts, a three bits SEQ field
   followed by a five bits TSQ field, a 6 bits Header Compression CRC,
   the RTP marker field and finally one bit indicating if header
   extensions are present. The COMPRESSED base-header formats are shown
   below. Note that some fields are only present in some of the
   COMPRESSED packet types.

   The Header Compression CRC is computed over the original IP/UDP/RTP
   packet header. The CRC polynomial to be used is:

     C(x) = 1 + x + x^3 + x^4 + x^6

   For more information about how to calculate the Header Compression
   CRC please see [ROCCO].

3.5.5.  Extensions to compressed headers

   Less regular changes of the header fields require an extension in
   addition to the base header. When there is an extension present in
   the COMPRESSED packet, it is indicated by the extension bit (X) being
   set. Extensions are of variable size depending on the information
   needed to be transmitted. However, the first three extension bits are
   used as an extension Type field for all extension formats. The
   extension can carry a TS delta field, a TS LSB field, a TSQ field, a
   SEQR field, a TSC field and a bit mask for additional fields. In the
   TSQ field, additional least significant bits of TSQ are sent to
   increase the timestamp range. The bits in the base header are always
   the least significant bits. The SEQR field is the LSB of the Sequence
   Number Residual defined in 3.4.2. Various bit mask patterns are
   possible and can consist of C,H,S,D,T and I. The interpretation of
   these bits are given at the end of this chapter.

   If both TSQ LSB and TS LSB is present in the same header the TSQ LSB
   is ignored and only the TS LSB bits is considered.

   Three of the most common delta timestamps have been assigned to a
   special 2 bits TimeStamp Code (TSC). This code can be used in the
   COMPRESSED packet extension instead of a large Timestamp Delta field.
   The predefined values are:

    TSC     Timestamp delta
    =======================
     00  |  3000 (30 Hz)
     01  |  3003 (29.97 Hz)
     10  |  3600 (25 Hz)
     11  |  other, a 2 octet Timestamp delta field is added after the
                   COMPRESSED packet extension.

   The guiding principle for choosing extension type is to find the
   smallest header type that can communicate the information needed.

   The defined extension types are shown below:

       - a counter of the number of CSRC items present (4 bits)
       - an unused field (4 bits)
       - the CSRC items, 1 to 15 (4-60 octets)

   When information of any kind is sent in an extension, the
   corresponding information SHOULD also be sent in three subsequent
   packets (either as Extensions or as DYNAMIC packets) to satisfy the
   three-packet-loss requirement.

7.5.6.  Feedback packets

   Feedback packets are used by the decompressor to provide various
   types of feedback to the compressor. That could include active
   feedback to assure an error free function or passive feedback in case
   of invalidated context to request a context update from the
   compressor. The general feedback packet format is shown below:

                                   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                                 +...+...+...+...+...+...+...+...+
                                 :   Context Identifier  (CID)   :
                                 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    FEEDBACK (GENERAL)           | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |    Type   |
                                 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

INTERNET-DRAFT    ROCCO Conversational Video Profiles      May 24, 2000


   The Type field tells what kind of feedback the packet corresponds to.
   For a description of the different available types please see
   [ROCCO].

3.6  Startup of timestamp encoding

   In many cases the timestamp delta is not known when a new header
   compression session starts. It is then RECOMMENDED to use the
   following startup procedure:

   1 - Set PCF=0;

   2 - As long as TS has not changed, send TSQ=0

   3 - As soon as TS change, send PCF and TSQ.
       This can be done in COMPRESSED extension number 5.

   When the PCF is sent, several subsequent packets SHOULD also contain
   PCF information. This ensures that the update will succeed even
   packets are lost.


3.7.  Context update procedure

   How to send and respond to various kinds of FEEDBACK packets are not
   defined in this document, but left to the implementers to decide.
   However, it is recommended to reduce both the number of requests and
   the number of corresponding updating packets. More guidelines for
   this issue will be included here when the implementation experience
   grows.


3.8  ROCCO over simplex links

   For a discussion about how [ROCCO] can be used over simplex links
   please see [ROCCO].


4.   Compression performance

   This section contains a short discussion about the compression
   performance of the [ROCCO] conversational video profile number 1003
   (see table 3.2). Profile 1003 is designed for Ipv4 and assumes that
   IP Identification is assigned sequential, no UDP checksum is used and
   that only one packet stream is present. The size of the COMPRESSED
   packet is in this profile 2 octets.

   If no packet reordering or packet losses is present only COMPRESSED
   packets will be sent after the startup procedure. This gives an
   average header size of 2 octets. All profiles defined in this

   of packets. It is also possible for the compressor to extend the
   sequence number field and timestamp field, this to increase the
   possibility to decode these fields correctly and not lose the
   synchronization in the decompressor if many packet losses occur.
   Since the base COMRESSED packet is designed to handle loss of up to 4
   consecutive packets over the link, for most channels it is not
   necessary to use the extended fields very often. This gives that the
   increase of the average header size is very small even if many packet
   losses occur.


5.   Implementation status

   The ROCCO algorithm, as defined in this versions of the Internet
   draft, has been implemented in a testbed environment for realtime IP
   traffic over wireless channels. Currently, only profile # 1003 is
   implemented. In the testbed it is possible to see the effects of
   header compression in conjunction with packet losses.


6.   Security considerations

   For security considerations please see [ROCCO].
