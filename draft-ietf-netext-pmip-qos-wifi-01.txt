        Mapping PMIPv6 QoS Procedures with WLAN QoS procedures 
                   draft-ietf-netext-pmip-qos-wifi-01

Abstract

   This document provides guidelines for achieving end to end QoS in a
   PMIPv6 domain where the access network is based on IEEE 802.11.   
   RFC 7222 describes QoS negotiation between a MAG and LMA in a PMIPv6
   mobility domain. The negotiated QoS parameters can be used for QoS
   policing and marking of packets to enforce QoS differentiation on the
   path between the MAG and LMA. IEEE 802.11-2012, WMM-AC describes
   methods for QoS negotiation between a Wi-Fi Station (MN in PMIPv6
   terminology) and an Access Point. This document provides a mapping
   between the above two sets of QoS procedures and the associated QoS
   parameters. This document is intended to be used as a companion
   document to RFC 7222 to enable implementation of end to end QoS.

Internet-Draft     Mapping PMIPv6 QoS with 802.11 QoS       July 3, 2014


1. Introduction

   [RFC 7222] describes an access network independent way to negotiate
   QoS for PMIPv6 mobility sessions. IEEE 802.11, WMM, WMM-AC describes
   ways to provide QoS for Wi-Fi traffic between the STA and AP. This
   document describes how QoS can be implemented in a network where the
   access network is based on IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi). This requires a
   mapping between QoS procedures and information elements in two
   segments 1) Wi-Fi segment and 2) PMIPv6 segment (see Figure 1). The
   recommendations here allow for dynamic QoS policy information per
   Mobile Node (MN)and  session to be configured by the IEEE 802.11
   access network. PMIPv6 QoS signaling between MAG and LMA provisions
   the per MN QoS policies in the MAG. In the IEEE 802.11 access network
   modeled here, the MAG is located at the Access Point (AP)/ Wireless
   LAN Controller (WLC). Figure 1 below provides an overview of the
   entities and protocols.

        Figure 1: End-to-End QoS in Networks with IEEE 802.11 Access

   MN and AP use IEEE 802.11 QoS mechanisms to setup QoS flows in the
   Wi-Fi segment. The MAG and LMA setup QoS flows using PMIPv6 QoS
   procedures. The protocols and mechanisms between AP and MAG are out
   of scope of this document. Some implementations may have AP and MAG
   in the same network node. However, this document does not exclude
   various deployments including those where AP and WLC are separate
   nodes, or the MAG control and data planes are separate. 

   The recommendations in this document for IEEE 802.11 accesses
   supplement RFC 7222 specifically as outlined below.

    - Procedure Mapping:
      PMIPv6 defined procedures for QoS setup maybe triggered by the LMA
      or MAG. IEEE 802.11 QoS setup on the other hand is always
      triggered by the MN (IEEE 802.11 QSTA). The end-to-end QoS setup
      across these network segments should accommodate both network
      triggered and end-user triggered QoS.

    - Parameter Mapping:
      There is no systematic method of mapping of specific parameters
      between PMIPv6 QoS parameters and IEEE 802.11 QoS. For example,
      parameters like ARP in PMIPv6 QoS have no equivalent in IEEE
      802.11.  

   The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section 2 provides
   an overview of IEEE 802.11 QoS. Section 3 describes a mapping of QoS
   signaling procedures between IEEE 802.11 and PMIPv6. The mapping of
   parameters between IEEE 802.11 and PMIPV6 QoS is described in Section
   4.

       PHY overheads [WMM 1.2.0].

   TSPEC
       The TSPEC element in IEEE 802.11 contains the set of parameters
       that define the characteristics and QoS expectations of a traffic
       flow.

   TCLAS
       The TCLAS element specifies an element that contains a set of
       parameters necessary to identify incoming MSDU (MAC Service Data
       Unit) that belong to a particular TS (Traffic Stream) [802.11-
       2012].

2. Overview of IEEE 802.11 QoS

   IEEE 802.11-2012 defines a way of providing prioritized access for
   different traffic classes (video, voice, etc) by a mechanism called
   EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access).  The levels of priority
   in EDCA are called access categories (ACs) and there are four levels
   (in decreasing order): Voice, Video, Best-Effort, Background. The
   prioritized access is achieved by using access category specific
   values for contention window (CW) and arbitration inter frame service
   (AIFS). (Higher priority categories have smaller values for minimum
   and maximum CW and AIFS.). WMM is a Wi-Fi Alliance certification of
   support for a set of features from an 802.11e draft (now part of IEEE
   802.11).  This certification is  for both clients and APs, and
   certifies the operation of WMM. WMM is primarily the implementation
   of the EDCA component of 802.11e.  WMM uses the 802.1P classification
   scheme developed by the IEEE (which is now a part of the 802.1D
   specification). The 802.1P classification scheme has eight
   priorities, which WMM maps to four access categories: AC_BK, AC_BE,
   AC_VI, and AC_VO.

   IEEE 802.11 also defines a way a (non-AP) STA can request QoS be
   reserved for an access category. Correspondingly, the AP can
   determine whether to admit or deny the request depending on the
   available resources.  Further, the AP may require that Admission
   Control is mandatory for an access category. In such a case, the STA
   is expected to use the AC only after being successfully admitted.
   WMM-AC is a Wi-Fi Alliance certification of support for admission
   control based on a set of features in IEEE 802.11.

   The QoS signaling in IEEE 802.11-2012 is initiated by the (non-AP)
   STA (by sending an ADDTS request). This specification references
   procedures in IEEE 802.11-2012, WMM and WMM-AC.

3. Mapping QoS Signaling procedures between IEEE 802.11 and PMIPv6

   There are two main types of interaction possible to provision QoS for
   flows that require admission control - one where the MN initiates the
   QoS request and the network provisions the resources. The second is
   where the network provisions resources as a result of PMIP QoS
   request. In the second scenario, the LMA can push the QoS
   configuration to the MAG. However, there are no standards defined way
   for the AP to initiate a QoS service request to the MN.
   Recommendations to setup QoS in both these cases are described in
   this section.

3.1. MN Initiated QoS Service Request

3.1.1. MN Initiated QoS Service Request

   This procedure outlines the case where the MN is configured to start
   the QoS signaling. In this case, the MN sends an ADDTS request
   indicating the QoS required for the flow. The AP/MAG obtains the
   corresponding level of QoS to be granted to the flow by PMIPv6
   PBU/PBA sequence with QoS options with the LMA. Details of the QoS
   provisioning for the flow are described below.

      Figure 2: MN initiated QoS service request

    [0] The MN establishes a connectivity session as described in [RFC
        7222], section 3.1, MAG-initiated QoS service request, steps 1-
        4. At this point, a connection with PMIPv6 tunnel is established
        to the LMA. This allows the MN to start application level
        signaling.

    [1] The trigger for MN to request QoS is an upper layer
        notification. This may be the result of end-to-end application
        signaling and setup procedures (e.g. SIP).

        Since the MN is configured to start QoS signaling, it sends an
        ADDTS request with TSPEC and TCLAS identifying the flow for
        which QoS is requested.

        It should be noted that WMM-AC specifications do not contain
        TCLAS.  When TCLAS is not present, the PMIPv6 QoS shall not
        contain any flow specific attributes like Traffic Selector.
        Thus, with WMM-AC, only a single reservation per access category
        (AC) is possible.

Internet-Draft     Mapping PMIPv6 QoS with 802.11 QoS       July 3, 2014


        The TSPECs for both uplink and downlink in this request should
        contain the Mean Data Rate and and may contain Peak Data Rate.  
        

    [2] If there are sufficient resources at the AP/WLC to satisfy the
        request, the MAG sends a PBU with QoS options, operational code 
        ALLOCATE and Traffic Selector identifying the flow. The Traffic
        selector is derived from the TCLAS to identify the flow
        requesting QoS. IEEE 802.11 QoS parameters in TSPEC are mapped
        to PMIPv6 parameters. The mapping of TCLAS to PMIPv6 is shown in
        Table 1. TSPEC parameter mapping is shown in Table 3.

    [3] The LMA obtains the authorized QoS for the flow and responds to
        the MAG with operational code set to RESPONSE. Mapping of PMIPv6
        to IEEE 802.11 TCLAS is shown in Table 1, TSPEC parameters in
        Table 3. 

        Reserved bandwidth for flows are accounted separately from the
        non-reserved session bandwidth. The Traffic Selector identifies
        the flow for which the QoS reservations are made. 

    [4] The AP/MAG provisions the corresponding QoS and replies with
        ADDTS Response containing authorized QoS in TSPEC and flow
        identification in TSPEC.

        The AP polices these flows according to the QoS provisioning.

3.1.2. MN Initiated QoS De-allocation Request

   QoS resources reserved for a session are released on completion of
   the session. When the application session completes, the policy
   server, or the MN may signal for the release of resources. In this
   use case, the network initiates the release of QoS resources.

      Figure 3: Network initiated QoS resource release

    [0] The MN establishes and reserves QoS resources.
        When the application session terminates, the MN prepares to
        release QoS  resources. 

    [1] MN releases its own internal resources and sends a DELTS Request
        to the AP with TS (Traffic Stream) INFO. 

    [2] AP receives the DELTS request, releases local resources and
        responds to MN with a DELTS response.

    [3] MAG initiates a PBU with Traffic Selector constructed from TCLAS
        and PMIPv6 QoS parameters from TSPEC (QoSx).

        When TLCAS is not present, the MAG should de-allocate all flows
        with the same access category (AC) as indicated in the DELTS
        Request. In the typical case, if the client does not support
        TCLAS and only MN initiated QoS Services requested are
        supported, then the MAG will have at most one QoS Service

        request per access category (AC).
    [4] LMA receives the PBU, releases local resources and informs
        policy server. The LMA then responds with a PBA.

3.2. LMA Initiated QoS Service Request

3.2.1. LMA Initiated QoS Reservation Request

   This section describes the case when the QoS service request is
   initiated by the LMA (see RFC 7222 for further details). In the
   current WLAN specifications, there are no standards defined way for
   the AP to initiate a QoS service request to the MN. As a result, when
   the MAG receives a QoS request from the LMA, it cannot initiate any
   QoS requests to the MN over the access network.  Given this, the
   PMIPv6 QoS service requests and any potential WLAN service requests
   (such as described in Section 3.1) are handled asynchronously. 

   The PMIPv6 QoS service requests and WLAN QoS service request could
   still be coordinated to provide an end to end QoS. If the MN
   initiates WMM-AC procedures after the completion of PMIPv6 QoS
   procedures the AP/MAG can ensure consistency between the QoS
   resources in the access network and QoS resources between the MAG and
   LMA.

   For example, if the MN is requesting a mean data rate of x Mbps, the
   AP and MAG can ensure that the rate can be supported on the network
   between MAG-LMA based on previous PMIPv6 QoS procedures. If the MN
   subsequently requests for data rates of x Mbps or less, the AP can
   accept it based on the earlier PMIPv6 QoS provisioning. For the case
   where there is a mismatch, i.e., the network does not support the x
   Mbps, then either the MAG should re-negotiate the QoS resource and
   ask for increased QoS resources or the AP should reject the QoS
   request.

3.2.2. LMA Initiated QoS De-allocation Request

   QoS resources reserved for a session are released on completion of
   the session. When the application session completes, the policy
   server, or the MN may signal for the release of resources. In this
   use case, the network initiates the release of QoS resources.

      Figure 5: LMA initiated QoS resource release

    [0] The MN establishes and reserves QoS resources as in use cases A,
        B or C.
        When the application session terminates, the policy server
        receives notification that the session has terminated. 

    [1] LMA receives a policy update indicating that QoS for flow (QoSx)
        should be released. The LMA releases local resources associated
        with the flow.

    [2] LMA sends a UPN with QoS options identifying the flow for which
        QoS resources are to be released, and operation code set to DE-
        ALLOCATE. No additional LMA QoS parameters are sent. 

    [3] MAG replies with UPA confirming the acceptance and operation
        code set to RESPONSE. 

    [4] AP/WLC (MAG) releases local QoS resources associated with the
        flow. The AP derives the corresponding Access Category from the

        DSCP field provided in the QoS option. In addition, if the AP
        supports TCLAS and the QoS option contains a Traffic Selector
        field, then the AP shall map the Traffic Selector into a TCLAS
        element. In the case where the AP does not support TCLAS (for
        example a WMM-AC compliant AP) then the AP shall only use the
        Access Category. The AP sends a DELTS Request with TS INFO
        identifying the reservation.

    [5] MN sends DELTS Response confirming release.

4. Mapping between IEEE 802.11 QoS and PMIPv6 QoS Parameters

4.1 Connection Parameters

   TSPEC in IEEE 802.11 is used to reserve QoS for a traffic stream (MN
   MAC, TS(Traffic Stream) id). The IEEE 802.11 QoS reservation is for
   IEEE 802.11 frames associated with an MN's MAC address. 

   The TCLAS element with Classifier 1 (TCP/UDP Parameters) is used to
   identify a PMIPV6 QoS flow. We should note that WMM-AC procedures do
   not support TCLAS. When TCLAS is present, a one-to-one mapping
   between the TCLAS defined flow and the Traffic Selector is given
   below.

      +------------------------------+------------------------------+
      |    MN <--> AP(IEEE 802.11)   |   MAG <--> LMA (PMIPv6)      |
      +------------------------------+------------------------------+
      | (TCLAS) TCP/UDP IP           |   Traffic Selector (IP flow) |
      | (TCLAS) |User Priority       |   DSCP                       |
      +------------------------------+------------------------------+

      Table 1: IEEE 802.11 - PMIPv6 QoS Connection mapping

      If the MN or AP is not able to convey flow parameters in TCLAS,
      the AP should use out of band methods to determine the IP flow for
      which QoS is requested. This may include higher level connection
      setup signaling (e.g., WCS in [TS23.402]).

4.2 QoS Class 

      Table 2 contains a mapping between Access Class (WMM AC) and
      802.1D in IEEE 802.11 frames, and DSCP in IP data packets. The
      table also provides the mapping between Access Class (WMM AC) and
      DSCP for use in IEEE 802.11 TSPEC and PMIPV6 QoS reservations.

      Table 2: QoS Mapping between QCI/DSCP, 802.1D UP, WMM AC

   The MN tags all data packets with DSCP and 802.1D UP corresponding to
   the application and the subscribed policy or authorization. The AP
   polices sessions and flows based on the configured QoS policy values
   for the MN.

   For QoS reservations, TSPEC uses WMM AC values and PMIPV6 QoS uses
   corresponding DSCP values in Traffic Selector. IEEE 802.11 QoS Access
   Class AC_VO, AC_VI are used for QoS reservations. AC_BE, AC_BK should
   not be used in reservations.

   When WMM-AC specifications that do not contain TCLAS are used, it is
   only possible to have one reservation per DSCP / access category
   (AC). PMIPv6 QoS will not contain any flow specific attributes like
   Traffic Selector.

4.3 Bandwidth

   Bandwidth parameters that need to be mapped between IEEE 802.11 and
   PMIP QoS are shown in Table 3. 

   Table 3 shows the mapping of bandwidth parameters.

Internet-Draft     Mapping PMIPv6 QoS with 802.11 QoS       July 3, 2014


      In PMIPV6 QoS, services using a sending rate smaller than or equal
      to Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) can in general assume that congestion
      related packet drops will not occur [TS 23.203]. If the rate
      offered  by the service exceeds this threshold, there are no
      guarantees provided. IEEE 802.11 radio networks do not offer such
      a guarantee, but [WMM 1.2.0] notes that the application (service)
      requirements are captured in TSPEC by the MSDU (MAC Service Data
      Unit) and Mean Data Rate. The TSPEC should contain Mean Data Rate
      and it is recommended that it be mapped to the GBR parameters,
      Guaranteed-DL-Bit-Rate and Guaranteed-UL-Bit-Rate in PMIPV6 QoS.

      IEEE 802.11 TSPEC requests do not require all fields to be
      completed. [WMM 1.2.0] specifies a list of TSPEC parameters that
      are required in the specification. Peak Data Rate is not required
      in WMM, however for MNs and APs that are capable of specifying the
      Peak Data Rate, it should be mapped to MBR (Maximum Bit Rate) in
      PMIPv6 QoS. The AP should use the MBR parameters, Aggregate-Max-
      DL-Bit-Rate and Aggregate-Max-UL-Bit-Rate to police these flows on
      the backhaul segment between MAG and LMA.

      During the QoS reservation procedure, if the MN requests Mean Data
      Rate, or Peak Data Rate in excess of values authorized in PMIPV6
      QoS, the AP should deny the request in ADDTS Response. The AP may
      set the reject cause code to REJECTED_WITH_SUGGESTED_CHANGES and
      send a revised TSPEC with Mean Data Rate and Peak Data Rate set to
      acceptable GBR and MBR respectively in PMIPV6 QoS.

5. Security Considerations

      This document describes mapping of PMIPv6 QoS parameters to IEEE
      802.11 QoS parameters. No security concerns need to be addressed
      as a result of this mapping.

6. IANA Considerations

      No IANA assignment of parameters are required.
