Internet-Draft           VoIP Features Data Set            November 2007


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] defines a configuration framework
   for finding, retrieving and notification of profile data for SIP
   [RFC3261] user agents.  It is intended that the VoIP Features dataset
   defined in this document may be contained in the user and device
   profiles described in the configuration framework.
   [I-D.petrie-sipping-profile-datasets] defines a general XML schema to
   contain user agent profile data.  This document defines VoIP specific
   feature data by extending the profile data sets schema.  The VoIP
   Features Data Sets defined in this document support the principle to
   enable SIP User Agents to obtain and use profile data sets from
   multiple sources in order to support a wide range of applications
   without undue complexity.

   The VoIP Feature Data Set suppports VoIP Features that are common
   across devices with SIP UAs.  This data set contains properties that
   all user agents require.  That does not mean that all of these
   properties are mandatory.

   The following elements are defined in this document to contain VoIP
   feature properties:
      mwiProperties
      digitMaps, including identification of emergency numbers (e.g.,
      911)
      callWaiting
      callTransfer

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   Keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and
   "MAY" that appear in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in RFC 2119[RFC2119].

1.2.  Overview

   The VoIP Feature data set is defined in Section 3 and complies with
   the guidelines provided in Section 5 of
   [I-D.petrie-sipping-profile-datasets]

   Section 4 provides illustrative example profiles and use cases for
   merging.  Security considerations are addresed in Section 5.

   The following is an example instance of the VoIP Feature data set.

   Note: in the digitMap element above containing an outboundIdentity
   element, the value "work" refers to the "id" attribute of a
   sipIdentity element to use for the outbound call (see
   draft-petrie-identity-dataset-00.txt).


2.  VoIP Features Data Set

   The XML schema defined in this document extends the root element
   property set schema defined in I-D.petrie-sipping-profile-datasets.

2.1.  mwiProperties Element

   Message Waiting Indication (MWI) is a service where the subscriber
   can access their voice mail message using a messageUri, be informed
   on the status of unheard messages with a device depenendent



Petrie, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           VoIP Features Data Set            November 2007


   indicator.

   mwiProperties -  This element contains properties related to Message
      Waiting Indication, and is an XML elelment that extends on the XML
      setting container element contained in the root "propertySet"
      element.  It serves as a container for mwi elements:
         messageUri
         mwiStatusUri
         mwiIndicator

   The messageUri and mwiStatusUri elements have values of type string
   that contain a SIP uri of the form name-addr from [RFC3261].

   messageUri -  The optional messageUri element MAY contain the URI to
      use for retrieving messages.  There MAY be zero or one messageUri
      element in mwiProperties element.
   mwiStatusUri -  The mwiStatusUri element contains the SIP URI used to
      subscribe to MWI event package [RFC3841].  Exactly one
      mwiStatusUri element SHOULD be contained in mwiProperties.
   mwiIndicator -  The mwiIndicator element sets the new message
      indication behavior of the user agent when there are new or
      unheard messages for the resource contained in mwiStatusUri
      element provided by the MWI event package [RFC3841].  The values
      of the mwiIndicator element are: "enable" or "disable".  A value
      of "enable" means that the user agent SHOULD indicate when there
      are messages available for the resource id contained in the
      mwiStatusUri.  A value of "disable" means that the user agent
      SHOULD NOT indicate whether messages are available or not.  The
      means of indication is a user agent implementation decision.  It
      may be a audable "stutter dial tone", a light indication or other
      user interface mechanism. .

   mwiProperties elements may be provided in both the Device and User
   profiles.  There may be multiple mwiProperties in the device and user
   profiles.  All instances of mwiProperties elements across the device
   and user profiles are used.  If a user agent supports the ablity to
   subscribe to a limited number of MWI resource IDs, the first N
   mwiProperties elements found when search through the device and then
   the user profile will be subscribe to, where N is the maximum number
   of resource IDs that the user agent can subscribe to.

2.2.  digitMap Element

   Digitmaps allow the user agent to decide when user is done dialing.
   The digitMap element contains the callPriority element which allow
   the user agent to categorize the type of call according to digit
   string patterns (e.g. emergency vs normal).  The digitMap element
   contains the uriTemplate element which defines how the user agent



Petrie, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           VoIP Features Data Set            November 2007


   should construct the INVITE request URI based upon digits dialed.
   The uriTemplate element allow routing of the outbound call based upon
   the digit string patterns by providing different information in the
   INVITE request URI.  The digitMap element can optionally contain a
   outboundId element which allows the definition of which identity to
   use for the call based upon digit string patterns.

   The digitMap is an XML elelment that extends on the XML setting
   element contained in digitMaps.  It serves as a container for a list
   of digit patterns.  Each pattern is associated with a SIP URI.  Digit
   patterns associated with emergency numbers are marked.  There may be
   one or more elements.  The digitMap element SHOULD contain exactly
   one digitPattern element and one uriTemplate.  The digitMap element
   MAY contain at most one callPriority element and one outboundId
   element.
   digitPattern -  The digitPattern element is of type string containing
      a digit map pattern using the DigitMap Syntax defined in
      [RFC3015].  Using the "|" (or) construct, the digitPattern MAY
      contain more than one match pattern.  There SHOULD be exactly one
      digitPattern element in a digitMap element.
   callPriority -  The callPriority element contains the the value
      "normal" or "emergency".  For calls initiated with digit strings
      that match the digitPattern contained in the digitMap, the
      callPriority element may be used to set the assocated priority of
      the call.  The user agent SHOULD give call processing priorities
      to calls initiated with a callPriority of value "emergency"
      appropriate for emergency service E911 calls.  There MAY be at
      most one callPriority element in a digitMap element.  The default
      value for the callPriority element is "normal".
   uriTemplate -  The uriTemplate element defines how the user agent
      SHOULD form the INVITE request URI for a given digit string.  The
      uriTemplate element contains a string which MAY contain the
      variable "{digits}".  If the uriTemplate element value contains
      "{digit}", the "{digits}" string is substitued with the actual
      digit string that the use dialed to form the INVITE request URI.
      So for the example digitMap elements above, if the user dialed the
      string 918005551212, the resulting INVITE request URI would be:
      "sip:918005551212@example.com".
   outboundId -  The outboundId element MAY be included in the digitMap
      element to indicate which identity from the identity dataset (see
      draft-petrie-identity-dataset-00.txt) is to be used for the
      outbound call.  The aor element value from the sipIdentity element
      which has an "id" attribute value matching the value of the
      outboundId element, is used as the From header field value in the
      INVITE.  The digitMap element SHOULD contain at most one
      outboundId element.

   There may be multiple sources of the digitMap across the device and

Internet-Draft           VoIP Features Data Set            November 2007


   user profiles.  All digitMap elements SHOULD be used in the order
   found in the device and user profiles.  Order is important as a
   dialed string of digits may match multiple patterns defined in the
   digitPattern elements.  The first digitMap element containing a
   digitPattern element that matches the user dialed digit string is
   used.

2.3.  callWaiting

   Call Waiting is a feature where the user while on a call in an
   establish INVITE dialog can receive indication of incoming INVITE for
   a new dialog.  When call waiting is enabled, the uesr agent SHOULD
   give indication of incoming INVITEs for new dialogs if a INVITE
   dialog is already established.  When call waiting is disabled, the
   user agent SHOULD send a 486 Busy response to incoming INVITE
   requests for new dialogs if an INVITE dialog is already established.

   callWaiting -  is an XML element that extends on the XML setting
      element contained in the root "propertySet" element.  It may
      provide by the device and/or user profile.  The callWaiting
      element contains the value: "enable" or "disable".  The default
      value is "enable".

   If multiple callWaiting elements appear in accross the device and
   user profiles, the first appearance will be used when searching
   through the device and then user profiles.

2.4.  callTransfer Element

   callTransfer -  This property specifies a container for callTransfer,
      and is an XML element that extends on the XML setting element
      contained in the root "propertySet" element.  For user agents that
      support the Call Transfer feature, this property defines the
      default behavior for the transfer operation on the user agent.
      Typically the user agent will have a function key or button or
      locally processed * code sequence which invokes the transfer
      operation.  If the user agent support multiple types of transfer
      operation, the callTransfer element specifies which is the default
      operation.  If the user agent supports only one method of
      performing transfer, the callTransfer element SHOULD be ignored by
      the user agent.  The values for the callTransfer element are
      "blind", "consult" or "none". "blind" indicates that only the
      REFER method SHOULD be used for transfer, but the "Replaces header
      SHOULD not used. "consult" indicates that the REFER method SHOULD
      be used and the "Replaces header SHOULD be used in the transfer
      operation. "none" indicates that the user agent SHOULD not expose
      or allow the transfer operation to the user.  See
      [I-D.ietf-sip-cc-transfer] for descriptions and call flows for

Internet-Draft           VoIP Features Data Set            November 2007


      blind and consultative transfer.

   The callTransfer element may be provided in either the Device or User
   profiles.  If both the Device and User profiles contain callTransfer
   elements, than the callTransfer element found first when searching
   through the device and then user profiles will be used.

   Note: [I-D.petrie-sipping-profile-datasets] defines a mechanism to
   disable blind or consultative transfer at a protocol level.  For
   example the following will disable transfer completely:


   <sipMethod policy="disallow">REFER</sipMethod>


   The following will disable consultative transfer:


   <sipOptionTags  policy="disallow">replaces</sipOptionTags>


   This is not the intended function of the callTransfer element.  The
   callTransfer element specifies that the default transfer operation is
   either blind or consultative.


3.  Security Considerations

   Security is mostly a profile delivery problem.  The delivery
   framework MUST provide a secure means of delivering the profile data
   as it may contain sensitive data that would be undesirable if it were
   stolen or sniffed.  Storage of the profile on the profile delivery
   server and user agent is an implementation problem.  The profile
   delivery server and the user agent MUST provide protection that
   prevents unauthorized access of the profile data.  The profile
   delivery server and the user agent MUST enforce the access control
   policies defined in the profile data sets if present.


4.  IANA Considerations
