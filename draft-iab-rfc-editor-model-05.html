<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
	The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be
	carried out by various persons or entities. The RFC Editor
	model presented in this document divides the responsibilities
	for the RFC Series into four functions: The RFC Series Editor,
	the Independent Submission Editor, RFC Production Center, and
	the RFC Publisher. It also introduces the RFC Series Advicory
	group and an (optional) Independent Stream Editorial Board. The model
	outlined here is intended to increase flexibility and
	operational support options, provide for the orderly
	succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the continuity of the
	RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality, maintaining timely
	processing, ensuring document accessibility, reducing costs,
	and increasing cost transparency.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
	The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is
	concerned with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series,
	orderly RFC Editor succession, maintaining RFC quality, and
	RFC document accessibility. The IAB is also sensitive to the
	concerns of the IAOC about providing the necessary services in
	a cost effective and efficient manner.
      
</p>
<p>
	The definition of the RFC series is described in RFC 4844
	<a class='info' href='#RFC4844'>[1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Daigle, L. and Internet Architecture Board, &ldquo;The RFC Series and RFC Editor,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Section 3.1 defines "RFC Editor":
      
</p>
<p>
	</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
| 3.1. RFC Editor
|
|  Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC
|  Series (the RFC Editor).  The task has grown, and the work now
|  requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are RFC
|  Editors, or an RFC Editor organization.  In time, there may be
|  multiple organizations working together to undertake the work
|  required by the RFC Series.  For simplicity's sake, and without
|  attempting to predict how the role might be subdivided among them,
|  this document refers to this collection of experts and organizations
|  as the "RFC Editor".
|
|  The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor,
|  acting to support the mission of the RFC Series.  As such, the RFC
|  Editor is the implementer handling the editorial management of the
|  RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes.  In addition,
|  the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime mover in
|  discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving
|  RFCs.
</pre></div><p>

      
</p>
<p>
	RFC 4844 makes no attempt to explore the internal organization
	of the RFC Editor. However, RFC 4844 envisions changes in the
	RFC Editor organizational structure.  In discussion with the
	Internet community, the IAB considered changes that increase
	flexibility and operational support options, provides for the
	orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensures the
	continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality,
	maintaining timely processing, ensuring document
	accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost
	transparency. The model set forth below is the result of those
	discussions, and examines the internal organization of
	the RFC Editor, while remaining consistent with RFC 4844.
      
</p>
<p>
	Note that RFC 4844 uses the term "RFC Editor function" or "RFC
	Editor" as the collective set of responsibilities for which
	this memo provides a model for internal organization. This
	memo introduces the term "RFC Series Editor" or "Series
	Editor" for one of the organizational components.
      
</p>
<p>
        The IAB approved the the initial version of this RFC Editor
        model on October 1, 2008, the model has received
        clarifications since. It should be noted that the publication
        of the document as an RFC does not cast the model in stone, as
        the primary purpose of this document, throughout the
        publication procession, is to encourage normal community
        review in order to ascertain consensus to work to this model
        as a first step. The document, and the resulting structures,
        will be modified as needed through normal procedures. The IAB
        will continue to monitor discussions within the community
        about potential adjustments to the RFC Editor model and
        recognizes that the process described in this document, may
        need to be adjusted to align with any changes that result from
        such discussions, hence the version number in the title.

IAOC Implementation</h3>

<p>
	The model is constructed in such a way that it allows for all
	these functions to be implemented jointly or under separate
	contractual arrangements. In fact, a bidder could put together
	a proposal that includes one or more subcontractors. The
	reporting structure will depend on the manner that the
	contracts are awarded, and they are subject to change over
	time. As a result, the model describes only responsibilities,
	procedures, and process. The exact implementation is a
	responsibility of the IAOC.

RFC Editor Model</h3>

<p>
	The RFC Editor model divides the responsibilities for
	the RFC Series into the following components:
      
</p>
<p>
	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>RFC Series Editor
</li>
<li>Independent Submission Editor
</li>
<li>RFC Production Center
</li>
<li>RFC Publisher
</li>
</ul><p>
      
</p>
<p>
	The RFC Series Production and Process under this structure is
	schematically represented by the figure below.

RFC Series Editor</h3>

<p>
	  The RFC Series Editor, is an individual who may have

<ol class="text">
<li>Identifying appropriate steps for RFC Series
	    continuity
</li>
<li>
	      Exercising executive-level management over the
	      implementation of policies, processes and procedures
	      established to ensure the quality and consistency for
	      the RFC Series.  The RFC Series Editor will work with
	      the RSAG, and, where appropriate, the IAB and IAOC to develop, new policy and see that
	      contractual agreements are met.
	    
</li>
<li>

<li>
	      Coordinating with IAB and/or IAOC, and together with the

<li> Overseeing consistency of RFCs with the RFC Series and RFC Style Manual
</li>
</ol><p>
	
</p>
<p>
	  There are many potential issues with respect to RFC Series
	  continuity. To name a few: Look and feel of the series,
	  indexing methodologies, accessibility of the publications,
	  IPR and copyright issues, and formatting issues.  After
	  identifying the appropriate steps to address such issues,
	  the implementation of those steps resides mostly with the
	  RFC production and publishing functions. Since the IAOC
	  maintains oversight of the implementation, the Series Editor
	  is expected to be invited and participate in reviews of that
	  implementation.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The RFC Series Editor is a senior technology professional
	  with the following qualifications:
	  </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Strong understanding of the IETF process
</li>
<li>Good understanding of the English language and technical
	    terminology related to the Internet
</li>
<li>Good communication skills
</li>
<li>Experience with editorial processes
</li>
<li>Independent worker
</li>
<li>Experience as an RFC author desired
</li>
</ol><p>
	
</p>
<p>
	  There are alternative selection methods for selecting the
	  individual to serve as the RFC Series Editor:
	
</p>
<p>
	  The first alternative involves a Request for Proposal (RFP)
	  process run by the IAOC. The IAOC would seek a person with
	  the listed qualifications in a broadly distributed RFP. The
	  winner would be selected by the IAOC in consultation with
	  the IAB, and then, the IAOC would contract for the
	  services. Contract terms, including length of contract,
	  extensions and renewals, shall be as provided in the
	  RFP. The opportunity to bid shall be broadly available. Fees
	  and expenses to support the administrative operation of the
	  RFC Series Editor would be part of the awarded contract and
	  be part of the IASA budget.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The second alternative involves a nomination and
	  confirmation process. Candidates are nominated, and then an
	  individual with the listed qualifications is selected by the
	  Internet community and confirmed by the IAB. An approach
	  similar to the one used by the IAB to select an IAOC member
	  every other year as described in <a class='info' href='#selection'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>IAB selection</span><span>)</span></a>
	  will be used. A stipend and expenses to support the
	  administrative operation of the RFC Series Editor selected
	  in this manner would be part of the IASA budget.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Based on an Request for Information (RFI) issued by the IAOC
	  in December 2008 the IAOC recommended that the second alternative
	  is choosen for the 2009-2010 selection cycle.

<p>
	  </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Technical competence, i.e. broad technical experience

	    in which no personal expertise exists.
</li>
<li>Thorough familiarity with the RFC series
</li>
<li>An ability to assess the technical competence of

</li>
<li>Good standing in the technical community, in and beyond
	    the IETF
</li>
<li>Demonstrated Editorial skills and good command of the English language 
</li>
</ol><p>

	  The Independent Submission Editor may seek support from an

	  may form a team to perform the activities needed to fulfill
	  their responsibilities.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The individual with the listed qualifications will be

	  to support the administrative operation of the Independent
	  Submission Editor selected in this manner will be
	  evaluated. The IAB considers maintaining the Independent
	  stream within the RFC Series part of the IAB's supported
	  activities, and will include these expenses in its
	  IASA-supported budget.

<p>
      The first alternative is to modify the IETF Secretariat contract

Charter</h3>

<p>
	The purpose of the RFC Series Advisory Group (RSAG) is to
	provide expert, informed guidance (chiefly, to the RSE) in
	matters affecting the RFC Series operation and development.
	Such matters include, but are not limited to, issues in
	operation of the RFC model components, and consideration of
	additional RFC streams, to give a sense of the range of topics
	covered.
      
</p>
<p>
	The RSAG is chartered by the IAB.  As such, it operates
	independently of the IAB to fulfill that charter, and provides
	periodic reports to the IAB via the RSE.
      
</p>
<p>
	The group provides guidance to the RSE, who in turn addresses
	immediate operational issues or opportunities with the ISE,
	Production House, or Publisher. In cases where these issues
	have contractual side-effects the RSE provides guidance to the
	IAD.  The RSAG also serves to provide advice to the RSE on
	longer-term, larger-scale developments for the RFC Series.
	This informs the proposals the RSE takes to the community for
	discussion, and the IAD/IAOC as proposals for implementation.
      
</p>
<p>
	The RSAG will assist the RSE in identifying and leading
	community discussion of important issues and opportunities
	facing the RFC Series.  The IAB retains its oversight role and
	is responsible for ensuring that adequate community discussion
	has been held on any such significant topics.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.2"></a><h3>4.1.2.&nbsp;
membership</h3>

<p>
	  The RSAG full members are all at large members, selected for
	  their experience and interest in the RFC Series, to provide
	  consistency and constancy of the RFC Series interpretation
	  over time; the members do not represent a particular RFC
	  stream or any organizations.  The RSAG members are proposed by the Series Editor in
	  consultation with the sitting RSAG members, and then
	  confirmed and formally appointed by the IAB.  In addition to these full members,
	  each RFC stream will appoint a liaison to the RSAG to
	  provide context specific to their stream. Initially there
	  will be no IAOC or IAB liaison for their oversight role, however as experience is
	  gained the IAOC, IAB, or RSAG may request for such. There is
	  no requirement or expectation that RSAG members will be IAB
	  members.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The RSAG does not select or appoint the RSE, or any other
	  component of the RFC Editor model, although it acts as an
	important resource for informing any selection process.
	
</p>
<p>
	  It is envisioned that the RSAG will be composed of 6 appointed
	  full members serving staggered 3 year terms, plus the RSE.
	  The full members will serve at the pleasure of the IAB --
	  appointed by the IAB, and if necessary, removed by the IAB.
	
</p>
<p>
	  In order to provide continuity and to assist with a smooth
	  transition of the RFC Editor function, the members of the
	  existing RFC Editor Editorial Board who are willing to do so
	  are asked to serve as an interim RSAG, effective as of the
	  time of approval of this document.  Within one year from the
	  time the RFC Editor function transitions to the new model and
	  after consideration of the operation of the new model in
	  practice, the interim RSAG and RSE will formulate a
	  recommendation to the IAB about the regular composition and
	  selection process for the permanent RSAG.

The RSE, RSAG, IAB, and IAOC roles in case of disputes</h3>

<p>
	  If during the execution of their activities, a dispute arises
	  over a policy implementation decision made by one of the four entities in
	  the model, then the party having the conflict should first
	  request a reconsideration of the decision.  If that
	  reconsideration is not satisfactory to the party, then the
	  matter can be brought to the Series Editor for a decision.   All parties should work in a good faith effort to resolve the situation to a mutually agreeable result. If
	  the Series Editor decision is not satisfactory, then the the
	  matter must be registered with the RFC Series Advisory Group. The RSAG may choose to offer advice to the RSE. While the Series Editor may
	  be requested to wait with a final decision until the RSAG's
	  advice is formulated, the Series Editor's decision is final.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Disputes registered with the RSAG and subsequent advice will
	  need to be made available publicly and reported to the IAB
	  in its oversight capacity.  
	
</p>
<p>
	  The discussion of these disputes
	  may inform future changes to Series policies
	
</p>
<p>
	  The RSE's decision is limited to
	  evaluation of whether current policies are appropriately
	  implemented in the decision.  In particular, it should be
	  noted that decisions about the technical content of
	  individual documents are not within the purview of the
	  Series Editor, but are the exclusive domain of the stream
	  approvers, such as the IESG and the Independent Submission
	  Editor.
	
</p>
<p>
	  In case a dispute has immediate or future contractual
	  consequences, the Series Editor report to the IAOC and, when
	  available, deliver the RSAG's advice. The IAD, under IAOC's
	  guidance has the responsibility to resolve contractual
	  issues whereby the Series Editor's report should be leading.
	
</p>
<p>
	  It should be noted that decisions about the technical content
	  of individual documents are not within the purview of the

Security considerations</h3>

<p>
      The same security considerations as those in RFC 4844 apply: The
      processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
      introduction of unapproved changes. Since the RFC Editor
      maintains the index of publications, sufficient security must be
      in place to prevent these published documents from being changed
      by external parties. The archive of RFC documents, any source
      documents needed to recreate the RFC documents, and any
      associated original documents (such as lists of errata, tools,
      and, for some early items, non-machine readable originals) need
      to be secured against failure of the storage medium and other
      similar disasters.
    
</p>
<p>
     The IAOC should take these security considerations into
     account during the implementation of this RFC Editor model.

IAB selection</h3>

<p>
      This process is used by the IAB for the selection of the RFC
      Series Editor (if that position is not covered by the RFC
      Production Center contract) and for the selection of the
      Independent Submission Editor. The IAOC selects the RFC
      Production Center and RFC Publisher from vendors that choose to submit
      a proposal.  The IAOC procurement process is not described in
      this document.
    
</p>
<p>The selection process herein is taken from <a class='info' href='#RFC4333'>[2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huston, G. and B. Wijnen, &ldquo;The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) Member Selection Guidelines and Process,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> but modified to allow for subject matter
    experts to advise the IAB, to take into account that the
    community with interest in the RFC series extends beyond the IETF
    community, and to prefer the incumbent.

Ad-hoc advisory committee</h3>

<p>
	It is expected that the IAB and IAOC will establish an ad-hoc
	advisory committee to assist them in the selection of the
	various functions.  The names of the members of this
	committee, who do not need to be IAB members or IETF
	participants, will be made public through the IAB and IAOC
	minutes or otherwise.
      
</p>
<p>
	The committee is expected to have an understanding of the RFC
	series and related processes, and of procedures and interests of the
	various streams.
      
</p>
<p>
	Members of the subcommittee will be privy to confidential
	material and are expected to honour confidentiality.
      
</p>
<p>
	The IAB and IAOC bear the responsibility for the selections of
	the candidates for defined functions, the committee provides
	advice only.

Ad-Hoc Advisory Committee Charter</h3>

<p>The charter for the ad-hoc advisory committee that was
	established for the first implementation of this model is
	reproduced below for purely informational purposes.
</p>
<p>
	  RFC Services Selection Oversight Subcommittee.
	
</p>
<p>The subcommittee will:
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li> Review the RFIs and RFPs involving all current RFC
	  Editor services before their release
</li>
<li> Review the RFI responses and make recommendations to the
	  IAOC and IAB as to the model, process and RFP going
	  forward
</li>
<li> Review the RFP proposals; conduct interviews; conduct
	  and analyze testing; if any, and make recommendations to the
	  IAOC
</li>
<li> Shepherd the IAB selection process for the relevant functions,
	  based on RFC4333 and provide and motivated shortlist to the IAB.
</li>
<li>The Subcommittee would terminate upon the completion of contract awards.
</li>
<li>The goal is to appoint members that are expected to have
	  an understanding of the RFC series, its processes and of
	  procedures and interests of the various streams.
</li>

Nominations and Eligibility</h3>

<p>
	  The IAB will be making a broad public call for nominations.
	  The public call will specify the manner by which nominations
	  will be accepted and the means by which the list of nominees
	  will be published. Self-nominations are permitted. Along
	  with the name and contact information for each candidate,
	  details about the candidate's background and qualifications
	  for the position should be attached to the nomination.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Members of the ad-hoc advisory committee mentioned above are
	  not eligible, but besides those there are no limitations
	  with respect to the eligibility for nomination: Nominees do
	  not have to be actively contributing to the IETF and active
	  participation as being a working group chair, an IETF
	  Nominating Committee member, or an IAB or IESG member is not
	  a limitation.
	
</p>
<p>
	  IAB members who accept a nomination for an IAB-selected
	  position will recuse themselves from IAB selection
	  discussions.

Selection</h3>

<p>
	  The IAB will publish the list of nominated persons prior to
	  making a decision, allowing time for the community to pass
	  any relevant comments to the IAB. When established, the
	  advisory committee will be asked to provide a motivated
	  shortlist. The IAB will review the nomination material, any
	  submitted comments, the shortlist from the advisory
	  committee, and make its selection.
	
</p>
<p>
	  It is noted that the community mentioned above is the
	  community with an interest in RFCs and the RFC Editor's
	  functioning, the IETF community is only a part of that
	  community.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The main intent is to select the incumbent or a superior
	  candidate.

Term of Office and Selection Time Frame</h3>

<p>
	  The IAB will seat their selected member at the first IETF
	  meeting of every third year, for a three-year term of office.
	  Basic time frame requirements for the selection process are
	  as follows:
	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>3-4 weeks for solicitation of nominations.
</li>
<li>3-4 weeks for review of nominees, deliberation, and selection.
</li>
</ul><p>

<p>
	  About 3-4 weeks prior to the process, the IAB will
	  announce the specific dates for the selection process for
