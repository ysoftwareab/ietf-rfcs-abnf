Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension               February 2011


1.  Introduction

   As social networking has become common, it has become clear that
   users would like to include information in their vCards
   [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev] about their social networks.  Well
   organized social network information allows the vCard owner to share
   his profile information and to import or subscribe to profile
   information of others on joining a new network.

1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Syntax specifications shown here use the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234], and are specified as in the base
   vcard specification [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].


2.  Social Network Properties

   These properties are related to sharing social-network information.
   The basis for these properties came from the "Friend of a Friend"
   (FOAF) specification, http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/ , and we should
   consider other aspects of that specification.
   [[anchor1: *** Do we want to align directly with FoaF items?  Are
   there more FoaF items we want to include, even if we're not aligning
   completely? *** Barry]]

2.1.  Property: OPENID

   [[anchor2: *** Maybe this should be something like
   "authentication;type=openid:" instead?  That would allow for other
   authentication types. *** Barry]]

   Namespace:

   Property name:  OPENID

   Purpose:  OpenID is an open, decentralized user identification
       standard, allowing users to log onto many services with the same
       digital identity.  Inclusion of an OpenID URI in a vCard lets
       others add the vCard owner's ID to their authorization lists.

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension               February 2011


   Value type:  A single URI value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  (none)

   Description:

   Format definition:
       OPENID-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       OPENID-value =  uri

   Example:

     OPENID:http://www.alice.openid.example.org

2.2.  Property: SOCIALPROFILE

   Namespace:

   Property name:  SOCIALPROFILE

   Purpose:  Designates the vCard owner's profile page on a particular
       social network.

   Value type:  A single URI value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  TYPE

   Description:  This property SHOULD include the parameter "TYPE" to
       specify the name of the social network that it refers to.
       Usually, that will also be discernible from the URI, which is why
       it's optional.  But it can be helpful to have it specified
       explicitly.

   Format definition:
       SOCIALPROFILE-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       SOCIALPROFILE-value =  uri

   Examples:

     SOCIALPROFILE;type=linkedin:http://www.linkedin.com/in/barryleiba

     SOCIALPROFILE;type=facebook:http://www.facebook.com/barackobama

2.3.  Property: ALBUM

   Namespace:

   Property name:  ALBUM

   Purpose:  Designates an online album, such as a photo album or video
       album.

   Value type:  A single URI value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  TYPE

   Description:  This property SHOULD include the parameter "TYPE" to
       specify the type of album that it refers to.  Usually, that will
       also be discernible from the URI, which is why it's optional.
       But it can be helpful to have it specified explicitly.

   Format definition:
       ALBUM-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       ALBUM-value =  uri

   Example:

     ALBUM;type=photo:http://picasaweb.google.com/barryleiba
     ALBUM;type=video:http://www.youtube.com/user/barryleiba

2.4.  Property: DEPICTION

   [[anchor3: *** What's the difference between this and "photo", from
   the base spec?  This is in FoaF, but do we really need it here?  Any
   comments from folks who are well versed in FoaF?  I get the sense
   that this is meant to be different, but I'm not sure how. ***
   (Barry)]]

   Namespace:

   Property name:  DEPICTION

   Purpose:  A depiction of something.

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension               February 2011


   Value type:  A single value.  The default is binary value.  It can
       also be reset to uri value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  VALUE

   Description:  A common use of depiction is to indicate the contents
       of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented
       in an online photo gallery.

       The basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal
       with multimedia content (video clips, audio),

   Format definition:
       DEPICTION-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       DEPICTION-value =  text

   Example:

     DEPICTION;value=uri:http://www.example.com/pub/photos/jqpublic.gif

2.5.  Property: SOCIALCODE

   Namespace:

   Property name:  SOCIALCODE

   Purpose:  Description of the vCard owner, in the form of a "social
       code", such as the "geek code" (see
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_code).  Social codes are
       popularly used to exchange a large amount of social information
       in a compact way, and provide a somewhat frivolous and willfully
       obscure "fun" mechanism for characterizing technical expertise,
       interests, and habits.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  TYPE

   Description:  This property MUST include the parameter "TYPE" to
       specify the type of social network code being used.  There are no
       predefined values for "TYPE", here -- the types will be
       understood (or not) by the vCard users.

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension               February 2011


       If the code contains characters that have to be quoted, such as
       COLON, SEMICOLON, or COMMA, the value MUST be enclosed in quotes.

   Format definition:
       SOCIALCODE-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       SOCIALCODE-value =  text

   Example:

     SOCIALCODE;type=geek:"s: a--"

           [Which means "I'm average size, and my age is 20-24."]

2.6.  Property: INTEREST

   Namespace:

   Property name:  INTEREST

   Purpose:  Lists the vCard owner's interests (social, recreational,
       technical, etc.).  This allows users to identify others with
       common interests.

   Value type:  A string value consisting of one or more text values
       separated by a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44).

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  TYPE, LANGUAGE

   Description:  This property MAY include the parameter "TYPE" to group
       interests in categories.  TYPE might be used to separate
       "business" interests from "social" interests, for example.  There
       are no predefined values for "TYPE", here -- the types will be
       understood (or not) by the vCard users, and it's likely that an
       ad hoc taxonomy will develop, as has happened with social
       tagging.

   Format definition:
       INTEREST-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       INTEREST-value =  text

   Example:

     INTEREST;type=social:friends and family,new friends
     INTEREST;type=hobby:model trains,reading Sci Fi,travel
     INTEREST;type=music:classical,jazz,folk,opera

2.7.  Property: XX

   [[anchor4: Template for adding another property, because we expect to
   add more properties here.  Remove this section before publishing.]]
   (This will also hold some references for the time being: [RFC2425]
   [RFC2426] [RFC2739] [RFC4770] )

   Namespace:

   Property name:

   Purpose:

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  VALUE, LANGUAGE

   Description:

   Format definition:
       XX-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       XX-value =  text

   Example:

     xx:zz


3.  Security Considerations

   This presents no security considerations beyond those in section 9 of
   the base vcard specification [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].

   [[anchor5: *** I'm quite sure there's more to say here, and that
   there are some real security (and privacy) considerations, so this is
   just a placeholder.  We need to think about this seriously before
   we're done. *** (Barry)]]

   Properties registry, defined in [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev] section
