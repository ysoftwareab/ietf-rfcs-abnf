Abstract

   This document introduces global elements into the SIP Conference
   Event Package XML schema to make the conference objects and sub-
   objects easily accessible by schemas external to the event package,
   such as the XCON conference control protocols.  This document also
   defines the way to introduce XCON extensions into the SIP Conference
   Event Package in a backwards compatible manner.  This document also
   defines a set of extensions to the SIP Conference Event Package XML
   schema being used in the XCON conferencing architecture.

Internet-Draft        Conference Package Extensions         October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The SIP Conference State Event Package [8] defines a means for
   describing a conference object with its sub-objects, such as users,
   endpoints, sidebars, etc. with optional detailed information for
   each.  This document introduces global elements into the SIP
   Conference State Event Package XML schema to make the conference
   objects and the sub-objects easily accessible by schemas external to
   the event package, such as of the XCON conference control protocols.
   This allows for uniform definition of the conference elements and
   sub-elements without replicating them for each XCON sub-system.

   This document also defines the way to introduce XCON extensions into
   the SIP Conference Event Package in a backwards compatible manner.
   The defined technique is compatible with the SIP Conference State
   Event Package [8] XML definitions and allows for automatic standard
   XML parsing of the extensions.

   This document is also being used as a repository for the XCON
   extensions to the SIP Conference Event Package XML schema.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


3.  Global Objects

   The SIP Conference State Event Package [8] defines a conference
   object which contains the information about many conference
   components, such as users, endpoints, sidebars, etc.  Using the SIP
   Events Mechanism RFC 3265 [6], the conference information is always
   distributed as a single document (full or partial) containing the
   Conference Object.  In order to manipulate the conference information
   or state, it is desirable to be able to access a sub-object of a
   conference directly - without the need for processing the whole
   document.  In order to achieve this granularity, this document
   introduces global elements into the SIP Conference State Event
   Package XML schema for each major object.  This allows for uniform
   definition of the conference elements and sub-elements without
   replicating them for each XCON sub-system.

   This document extends the XML definition of the
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info namespace as follows:

4.  Conference Event Package Schema Extensibility

   The conference event package allows a user to subscribe to the
   information relating to a conference.  This document doesn't affect
   any of the assumptions, procedures, and considerations present in the
   SIP Conference State Event Package [8].  These include the package
   name, XML namespace, default filtering policy, subscription duration,
   the data format name, and the data format.

   The SIP Conference State Event Package [8] XML definition mandates
   that any package extension elements belong a name space different
   from the original schema.  The SIP Conference State Event Package
   schema does allow for extensions from multiple namespaces being
   simultaneously included.  It is envisioned that the extensions will
   be introduced gradually (i.e. through multiple extension versions)
   and potentially from different sources.  In order to automatically
   process the extended XML document, it must comply with a standard and
   therefore deterministic XML schema, which means that a parser
   recognizing document element contents has to be able to decide,
   without look ahead, which content model token to match with the
   current input token, while processing the document from left to
   right.

   By simply introducing a new element or elements into the allowed

   places of the SIP Conference State Package schema, each extended
   sequence seizes to be extensible due to the known "non-deterministic"
   (i.e., ambiguous) content model.

   In order to mitigate the problem, this document introduces a concept
   of a "separator" being defined in a separate name space.  The
   namespace URI for the separator is a URN [2], using the namespace
   identifier 'ietf' defined by [4] and extended by RFC 3688 [10].  This
   URN is:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info-separator

   This document introduces the XML definition of the
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info-separator namespace as
   follows:



   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
   <xs:schema
   targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info-separator"
   xmlns:tns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info-separator"
   xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
   xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info-separator"
   elementFormDefault="qualified"
   attributeFormDefault="unqualified">

       <!--
       This defines a separator marking the beginning of extensions
       -->
       <xs:element name="separator">
           <xs:complexType/>
       </xs:element>
   </xs:schema>

   For example, if XCON decides to add a <disclaimer> free text element
   to the <conference-description>, the extended <conference-info>
   schema needs to include the <disclaimer> element defined just after
   the XCON extension(s).  The example below illustrates the technique:


   <xs:schema
   targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info"
   xmlns:tns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info"
   xmlns:cis="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info-separator"

   xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info"

      CONFERENCE STATE
   -->
    <conference-state>
     <user-count>33</user-count>
    </conference-state>
   </conference-info>

   By using the technique above, a receiver of the XML document can
   deterministically parse multiple blocks of unknown extensions and
   skip them as long as the known extensions appear in the known order.
   In the example above but without the <cis:separator>, the schema
   would have been ambiguous, since the newly added element can be
   parsed as either matching the <cix:disclaimer> or as part of the <xs:
   any>.


5.  XCON Extensions to Conference Event Package Schema

   The SIP Conference State Event Package [8] XML definition mandates
   that any package extension elements need to be defined in a name

   space different from the original schema.  This document registers a
   new namespace URI where all XCON extensions to the SIP Conference
   Event Package MUST be defined.  The namespace URI for XCON extensions
   is a URN [2], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [4]
   and extended by RFC 3688 [10].  This URN is:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xcon-conference-info

   The XCON extensions are defined in the schema below:

   EDITOR's NOTE: The schema below is just an example of how the XCON
   extensions need to be schematized.  The real extensions TBD based on
   the requirements.


   <xs:schema
   targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xcon-conference-info"
   elementFormDefault="qualified"
   attributeFormDefault="unqualified"
   xmlns:tns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xcon-conference-info"

   xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
   xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xcon-conference-info">

      <xs:element name="disclaimer" type="xs:string"/>

   </xs:schema>


6.  Security Considerations

   Subscriptions to conference state information can reveal very
   sensitive information.  Moreover, manipulation of this information
   through conference control protocols requires a strong means for
   authentication, conference information protection, and applying
   comprehensive authorization rules by a focus.  Users of this
   specification MUST comply with the security considerations discussed
   in the SIP Event Package for Conference State [8] and the conference
   control protocol specifications, such as CCCP [11].


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers two new XML namespaces and two new XML
   schemas.
