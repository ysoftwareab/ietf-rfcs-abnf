Abstract

   This memo defines a payload format for carrying program timing and
   identification cues in RTP [2] packets.


1.  Introduction

   This memo describes how to carry program timing information in RTP
   packets known as program cues.  A cue is a signaling message inserted
   in, or associated with, an RTP stream. Each cue conveys information
   about the structure or semantics of a program.  Cues typically
   indicate events whose precise timing is significant to receivers,
   such as the start or stop time of a program segment.

   Embedding cues in RTP streams facilitates the creation of
   applications which receive and process one or more RTP streams.
   These stream processing applications might exist at a receiver or at
   a network intermediary (e.g., gateway or proxy). Examples of
   applications whose implementations are eased by the presence of cues
   include program recording, insertion, switching, or adaptation; see
   [3] for a discussion of these applications.  Such applications
   typically require relatively tight time synchronization with arriving
   media packets to operate correctly.  Failure to maintain precise time
   synchronization -- say when switching between two source streams --

   could result in undesired perceptible artifacts when the resulting
   stream is rendered.  Tight time synchronization between applications
   and media streams is also required in implementations where
   relatively little media packet buffering is available at a stream
   processing point.

   Cues are optional within an RTP stream. Each cue corresponds to a
   distinct RTP packet; no attempt is made to piggyback cues on RTP
   packets containing media data, nor to incorporate multiple cues
   within a single RTP packet. Cues can but do not necessarily travel
   from end-to-end (i.e., sender to receiver); network intermediaries
   which receive an RTP stream with embedded cues may add or remove cues
   prior to forwarding. For example, an audio stream transmitted from a
   source internet radio station to affiliate radio stations (for the
   purpose of rebroadcast) might include certain cues which contain
   locally significant or private information which need not be
   forwarded to a receiver of an affiliate's retransmitted stream.

   It is anticipated that cues typically will be carried in-band;
   program cues and media packets will form a single RTP stream on a
   common connection, with cues distinguished by a separate payload
   type. However, this document also discusses the possible use of out-
   of-band cues. In this case, cues and media packets form a single RTP
   stream but are transmitted on separate connections.  Out-of-band
   delivery of cues might be desirable if privacy is sought, or if the
   out-of-band communications uses an underlying reliable protocol
   (e.g., TCP) while the media packets are carried by an unreliable
   protocol (e.g., UDP). Out-of-band cues might also be desired in
   certain rights management or monitoring applications, where receipt
   of program cues is required but receipt of the media packets
   themselves might not be necessary.

   RTP cues are intended for the limited purpose of conveying program
   timing information, and other related program information whose
   precise timing is significant to receivers.  Other out-of-band
   communication mechanisms (e.g., RTCP, SAP, HTTP) should be used to
   carry program information which is relatively time-insensitive. An
   example of such program information would be an internet television
   station's weekly programming schedule announcement or an internet
   radio station's future playlist.

   Transport layer cues provide a media-independent mechanism to convey
   program structure and facilitate application creation. Program
   structure, often at a more detailed level, might be conveyed at other
   protocol layers in addition to the transport layer. Cues enable
   network intermediaries to perform stream processing without incurring
   latencies associated with examining RTP payloads and identifying
   program structure as encoded at the application-level. In many cases
   this will free applications from needing to know about a multiplicity
   of media encoding formats.

   Cues can be related to other types of signaling messages and protocol
   exchanges. RTCP [2] conveys information about associated RTP streams
   on a relatively slow time scale. Since cues typically delimit and

   identify events, they can be related to 'named events' as proposed
   for telephone signaling over RTP [4]. Cues can also be viewed as
   protocol messages flowing downstream with content for the purpose of
   content modification or enhancement at 'edge' servers, somewhat
   analogous to the role played by proposed Internet Content Adaptation
   Protocol (I-CAP) [5] extensions to HTTP.


1.1.  Terminology


   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


1.2.  Cues in Conventional Broadcasting


   Various types of program cues are used extensively to facilitate
   program insertion, switching and recording applications in
   traditional broadcast media (i.e., radio and television).  Examples
   include:

   Radio Data System (RDS) for VHF/FM Broadcasting [7]

   The RDS system provides traffic, station and song information to
   RDS-capable radio receivers, primarily in cars. Cues, known as flags,
   are sent out-of-band on unused, alternate frequencies.  Receivers can
   view program information on a small alphanumeric character display,
   and operate radios in automatic switch-over mode to receive a travel
   alert or a preferred program type (e.g., news program).

   Program Delivery Control (PDC) [8]

   PDC is a system for encoding television program identity and start
   and stop times in teletext to facilitate recording on PDC-capable
   VCRs. Program identity labels (PILs) are transmitted at the start of
   each broadcast, and at one second intervals throughout. Corresponding
   published program information (e.g., Gemstar's ShowView and
   VideoPlus+) can be obtained in printed TV guides and entered into a
   PDC-capable VCR.

   Pass through with Local Program Insertion in Cable Headends

   Insertion of local programming content at conventional analog cable
   television head ends has been aided by DTMF 'cue tones' transmitted
   along with program content from a signal source.  The demodulated
   tones have been used to automatically trigger remote ad inserters and
   channel multiplexors [9-10].  Examples of cue functions include an
   'Entry' (start, pre-roll) tone delivered 8 seconds prior to a local
   insertion to provide adequate setup time for insertion equipment
   initialization.  A corresponding 'Exit' (stop, switch to network)

INTERNET-DRAFT    RTP Payload Format for Program Cues      November 2000


   tone indicates the end of an insertion period.

   Cues placed in RTP streams are intended to facilitate the creation of
   internet services comparable to RDS, PDC, and local ad insertion
   services in conventional radio and television broadcasting. In
   addition, the cues described in this document are intended to be
   extensible, facilitating the creation of new services which enhance
   the value of media streams.


2.  RTP Payload Format

2.1.  Introduction

   The proposed payload format for cues described below facilitates
   stream processing at both network 'intermediaries' (i.e., not
   destinations) and receivers (i.e., destinations). In the former
   scenario, an intermediary receives one or more RTP streams, processes
   these streams, and retransmits one or more possibly modified streams
   to other network intermediaries or receivers. Intermediaries might
   forward or remove cues that are primarily useful for processing by
   intermediaries.  End systems also process RTP streams with embedded
   cues, but the streams are terminated (i.e., not forwarded).


2.2.  Cue Types


   Each program cue represents one of four different types of signals:


   Event Notification    An Event Notification (EN) cue notifies the
                         recipient of the initiation of an event.


   Event Termination     An Event Termination (ET) cue notifies the
                         recipient of the completion of an event.


   Event Pending         An Event Pending (EP) cue notifies the
                         recipient of an uncoming event.  Depending on
                         application requirements, a sender may issue
                         multiple (redundant) EPs associated with each
                         event at various times prior to the event.


   Event Continuing      An Event Continuing (EC) cue notifies the
                         recipient that an event is in progress.
                         Depending on application requirements, a sender
                         may issue multiple ECs associated with an
                         ongoing event at various times during the
                         event.

      A compliant receiving implementation should support the cue types

      listed above. Each cue must be unambiguously set to one of the
      above cue types, otherwise the receiver should ignore it.


2.3.  Use of RTP Header Fields

                         Figure 1: RTP packet header


   RTP header fields in cue packets are used as follows:


   Timestamp             The RTP timestamp reflects the measurement
                         point for the event indicated by the current
                         packet.  The event duration, as described in
                         Section 2.4, extends forward from that time.
                         The timestamp rate of cues is identical to the
                         timestamp rate of the associated media.


   Marker                The RTP marker bit set to 1 indicates the
                         beginning of an event.

      In accordance with current practice, the cue payload format does
      not have a static Payload Type (PT) number, but uses an RTP
      payload type number established dynamically and out-of-band.



2.4.  Payload Format

   The proposed payload format is shown in Fig. 2.

   event type            The event type specifies the nature of the
                         indicated event. This field is encoded as shown
                         in Section 2.8.


   N                     If set to a value of one, the "notification"
                         bit indicates an EN packet.


   T                     If set to a value of one, the "termination" bit
                         indicates an ET packet.


   P                     If set to a value of one, the "pending" bit
                         indicates an EP packet.


   C                     If set to a value of one, the "continuation"
                         bit indicates an EC packet.

                         event. Depending on application requirements,
                         event numbers may increase sequentially or be
                         associated with a well known, reserved program
                         identifier.  If no ID is available, the value
                         0x00000000 is used.


   duration              The (remaining) duration of an event is the
                         estimated time remaining before completion of
                         the specified event, in timestamp units.  The
                         duration of an event for different cue types is
                         interpreted as follows:


                            1. An EP packet's duration specifies the
                            time before the expected occurrence of the
                            associated pending event.


                            2. An EN packet indicating the start-of-
                            event has a duration set at the expected
                            time until the corresponding end-of-event.


                            3. An ET indicating the end-of-event has a
                            duration set to zero. An exception exists if
                            multiple, redundant ETs are issued for the
                            purpose of increased reliability. In that
                            case, the duration of an ET message sent in
                            advance of the event's completion specifies
                            the estimated time before completion of the
                            event.


                            4. An EC packet has a duration set to the
                            expected time until the end of the currently
                            continuing event's completion.

                         sender must set it to zero, and the receiver
                         must ignore it.

   label                 A variable-length text field.


2.5.  Markers at other Protocol Layers


   Information about the structure or semantics of program content might
   exist at protocol layers other than the Transport Layer.  This would
   be the case, for example, for MPEG-2 transport streams encapsulated
   in RTP [11].  Hence, it is possible that program cues might contain
   either redundant or incomplete information relating to a specific
   event for certain media types.


2.6.  Reliable Signaling and use of Redundant Cues


   Cues placed in an RTP stream might fail to arrive to their
   destination.  For the purposes of obtaining reliable signaling while
   using an unreliable protocol (e.g., UDP), a sending application can
   issue multiple, redundant cues to signal the same event.  A typical
   example of an acceptable use of redundant cues might include issuing
   multiple EPs followed by an EN packet. An alternate example would be
   issuing redundant ET packets at the end of an event.  Implementations
   should be capable of properly handling redundant cues, as well as
   cues that are erroneously duplicated in transit.

   Mechanisms to increase the reliability of RTP packet arrival to a
   destination can be applied to streams containing cues.  For example,
   the forward error correction mechanism described in RFC 2733 [12] may
   be used to recover from packet loss in streams containing cues.

2.7.  Timing of Event Packets


   Cues placed in an RTP stream can arrive to a destination out-of-
   order.  Hence, the precise placement of a cue in an RTP stream is not
   required.  In general, application requirements dictate the
   appropriate time of transmission of cues in an RTP stream. The
   timestamp and duration fields of a cue convey the precise time of an
   event, not the cue's position within an RTP stream nor its sequence
   number.

   It is the responsibility of a processing application to buffer enough
   packets to handle lost or out-of-order cues. However, placing a cue
   near in time to its associated event can reduce the need for receiver
   buffering. Applications should strive to place certain cues in the
   transmitted stream at approximately the time of the associated event.
   In particular, an EN cue marking the beginning of an event should be
   placed in the stream within 50ms of the transmission time of the
   first media packet associated with the event.  An ET cue (with
   duration set to zero) marking the end of an event should be placed in
   the stream within 50ms of the transmission time of the last media
   packet associated with the event.

   In general a source should also avoid sending cues to mark events
   which have occurred at much earlier times, since these cues are
   unlikely to be useful to the receiver.

2.9.  Application Example


   Consider how program cues might ease coordination between cooperating
   applications in the following commercial video advertisement
   insertion application.  Suppose a broadcaster transmits an RTP stream
   to a network affiliate for the purpose of modification and
   retransmission to receivers.  The broadcaster seeks to allow the
   affiliate a time slot for an out-of-network video program insertion.
   The broadcaster issues an EP cue (with event type 13) 8 seconds prior
   to an interstice suitable for a program insertion. The network
   affiliate receives the EP cue, and initiates setup of video insertion
   equipment. A second, redundant EP cue is sent 0.5 seconds prior to
   the final RTP packet of the program segment preceding the interstice,
   providing the affiliate with an improved estimate of the upcoming
   interstice's start time. Subsequent to the final media packet
   transmission for the terminating program segment, the broadcaster
   issues an EN cue (event type 13).  Upon receipt of the EN cue the
   downstream affiliate begins transmitting a new, inserted program to
   the receivers.  EC cues are transmitted by the broadcaster to the
   affiliate at 1 second intervals during the program interstice period.
   Immediately prior to the broadcaster transmitting the first media
   packet of the subsequent program segment to the affiliate, the

   broadcaster issues an ET packet to indicate the termination of the
   interstice.

   In the above example, no cues were forwarded to receivers by the
   affiliate; all cues transmitted by the broadcaster were deemed
   private and not included in the retransmitted stream.


3.  Indicating Cue Usage in SDP and RTSP


   Cues can be sent either with media packets or as a separate stream.
   For the latter case, cues can be sent on separate multicast groups or
   separate ports from the media.  In either case, these configuration
   options must be indicated out of band. This section describes how
   this can be accomplished using the Session Description Protocol
   (SDP), specified in RFC 2327 [13], and the Real Time Streaming
   Protocol (RTSP), specified in RFC 2326 [14].


3.1.  Cues sent separately from a Media Stream

   Cues can be sent on a separate connection from media packets.  This
   can mean they are sent on a different port and/or multicast group
   from the media. When this is done, several pieces of information must
   be conveyed:

      The address and port where the cue stream is being sent to

      The payload type number for the cues

      Which media stream the cues are describing

   The payload type number for the cue stream is conveyed in the m line
   of the Session Description of the associated media, listed as if it
   were another valid encoding for the stream. There is no static
   payload type assignment for cues, so dynamic payload type numbers
   must be used.  The binding to the number is indicated by an rtpmap
   attribute.  The name used in this binding is "cues".

   The presence of the payload type number in the m line of the
   associated media does not mean the cues are sent to the same address
   and port as the media. Instead, this information is conveyed through
   an fmtp attribute line. The presence of the cue payload type on the m
   line of the media serves only to indicate the stream associated with
   the cues.

   Recall that the format for the fmtp line is:

   a=fmtp:<number> <port> <network type> <address type> <connection
   address>

   where 'number' is the payload type number present in the m line. Port
   is the port number where the cue stream is sent to. The remaining

INTERNET-DRAFT    RTP Payload Format for Program Cues      November 2000


   three items - network type, address type, and connection address -
   have the same syntax and semantics as the c line from SDP. This
   allows the fmtp line to be partially parsed by the same parser used
   on the c lines.

   The following is an example SDP for cues sent separately from their
   associated media stream:

      v=0
      o=brassil 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 126.16.64.4
      s=Cueing Seminar
      c=IN IP4 224.2.17.12/127
      t=0 0
      m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0 78
      a=rtpmap:78 cues/8000
      a=fmtp:78 49172 IN IP4 224.2.17.12/127

   The presence of one m line in this SDP indicates that there is a
   single media stream - audio. The default media format of 0 indicates
   that the audio is PCM encoded, and an additional associated format
   for cues has payload type number 78. The cues are sent to the same
   multicast group and TTL as the audio, but on a port number two higher
   (49172).


3.2.  Usage with RTSP


   RTSP [14] can be used to request cues to be sent as a separate
   stream. When SDP is used with RTSP, the Session Description does not
   include a connection address and port number for each stream.
   Instead, RTSP uses the concept of a "Control URL". Control URLs are
   used in SDP in two distinct ways.

      1. There is a single control URL for all streams. This is referred
      to as "aggregate control". In this case, the fmtp line for the cue
      stream is omitted.

      2. There is a Control URL assigned to each stream. This is
      referred to as "non-aggregate control". In this case, the fmtp
      line specifies the Control URL for the cue stream.  The URL may be
      used in a SETUP command by an RTSP client.


   The format for the fmtp line for cues with RTSP and non-aggregate
   control is:

          a=fmtp:<number> <control URL>

   where 'number' is the payload type number present in the m line.
   Control URL is the URL used to control the cue stream.  Note that the
   Control URL does not need to be an absolute URL. The rules for
   converting a relative Control URL to an absolute URL are given in RFC
   2326, Section C.1.1.

4.  Security Considerations


   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification (RFC 1889 [1]), and any appropriate RTP profile (for
   example RFC 1890 [15]).This implies that confidentiality of the media
   streams is achieved by encryption. Because the data compression used
   with this payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be
   performed after compression so there is no conflict between the two
   operations.

   This payload type does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity in
   the receiver side computational complexity for packet processing to
   cause a potential denial-of-service threat.

   Additional security considerations are described in RFC 2198.
