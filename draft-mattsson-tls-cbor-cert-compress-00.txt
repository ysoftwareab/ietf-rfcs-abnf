       CBOR Certificate Algorithm for TLS Certificate Compression
                draft-mattsson-tls-cbor-cert-compress-00

Abstract

   Certificate chains often take up the majority of the bytes
   transmitted in TLS handshakes.  Large handshakes can cause problems,
   particularly in constrained IoT environments.  RFC 7925 defines a TLS
   certificate profile for constrained IoT.  General purpose compression
   algorithms can in many cases not compress RFC 7925 profiled
   certificates at all.  By using the fact that the certificates are
   profiled, the CBOR certificate compression algorithms can in many
   cases compress RFC 7925 profiled certificates with over 50%. This
   document specifies the CBOR certificate compression algorithm for use
   with TLS Certificate Compression in TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3.

1.  Introduction

   As stated in [I-D.ietf-tls-certificate-compression], certificate
   chains often take up the majority of the bytes transmitted in TLS
   handshakes.  Large handshakes negatively affect latency, but can also
   result in that the handshake cannot be completed
   [I-D.ietf-emu-eaptlscert].  To reduce handshake sizes,
   [I-D.ietf-tls-certificate-compression] specifies a mechanism for
   lossless compression of certificate chains in TLS 1.3 and defines
   three general purpose compression algorithms.

   Large handshakes is particularly a problem for constrained IoT
   environments [RFC7228] [I-D.ietf-lake-reqs].  [RFC7925] defines a
   X.509 certificate profile for constrained IoT.  The certificate
   profile in [RFC7925] is defined for TLS/DTLS 1.2 but works also for
   TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13].  For such
   profiled IoT certificates, general purpose compression algorithms
   such as zlib are however far from optimal and the general purpose
   compression algorithms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-certificate-compression] can in many cases not compress

   RFC 7925 profiled certificates at all.
   [I-D.raza-ace-cbor-certificates] therefore defines a CBOR [RFC7049]
   compression algorithm for RFC 7925 profiled certificates.  The
   algorithm works for all RFC 7925 profiled certificates and provide
   significant reduction in size, in many cases over 50%.

   This document specifies the CBOR certificate compression algorithm
   [I-D.raza-ace-cbor-certificates] for use with TLS Certificate
   Compression [I-D.ietf-tls-certificate-compression].  TLS Certificate
   Compression can be used in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and DTLS 1.3
   [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13].

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  CBOR Certificate Compression Algorithm

   This document specifies the CBOR certificate compression algorithm
   specified in Section 3 of [I-D.raza-ace-cbor-certificates] for use
   with TLS Certificate Compression
   [I-D.ietf-tls-certificate-compression].  TLS Certificate Compression
   can be used in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13].

   The CBOR Certificate compression algorithm takes as input a RFC 7925
   profiled X.509 certificate.  The output of the CBOR compression
   algorithm is a CBOR Sequence [I-D.ietf-cbor-sequence], i.e. a
   sequence of concatenated CBOR encoded CBOR data items [RFC7049].
   Compressed certificates can be analysed with any CBOR decoder and be
   validated against the CDDL specification defined in Section 3 of
   [I-D.raza-ace-cbor-certificates].

   The algorithm works for all RFC 7925 profiled certificates and
   provide significant reduction in size, in many cases over 50%. An
   example compression of a RFC 7925 profiled certificate is given
   below.
