Internet-Draft         Constraining Kerberos Names        September 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the syntax and semantics of constraints imposed
   on Kerberos names used in X.509 certificates.

   The X.509 specification [7] and RFC 3280 [2] define the concept of
   name constraints that guide acceptance rules for names placed by
   Certification Authorities (CAs) in X.509 certificates they issue to
   other CAs or to end entities.  Name constraints apply to names in the
   Subject field and the Subject Alternative Name extension of X.509
   certificates.

   RFC 4556 [4] defines syntax of Kerberos names used in X.509
   certificates without defining mechanisms for constraining such names.
   This is the purpose of this document.  Name constraints defined here
   are meant to be applied by relying parties to RFC 4556-style Kerberos
   names.

3.  Preliminaries

3.1.  Names in X.509 Certificates

   The X.509 specification [7] and RFC 3280 [2] stipulate the use of
   subject names at two locations in the certificates: (a) in the
   Subject field as an X.500 name and (b) in the Subject Alternative
   Name extension.  Well-known name types that may be placed in the
   Subject Alternative Name extension include RFC 822- and X.400-
   compliant e-mail addresses, host names, additional X.500 names, URIs
   and IP addresses.  An extension mechanism is provided for custom name
   types usable by specific organizations, applications or communities
   of interest.  This extension mechanism is implemented through the
   otherName choice of the type GeneralName [2]:

   OtherName ::= SEQUENCE {
       type-id    OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
       value      [0] EXPLICIT ANY DEFINED BY type-id
   }

3.2.  Name Constraints in X.509 Certificates

   Sometimes CAs issuing X.509 certificates to other CAs want to
   constrain the subject names used by these (other) CAs and their
   subrodinate CAs.  For instance, an enterprise-wide CA for the domain
   example.com may want to allow CAs in the organizational units
   unit1.example.com and unit2.example.com to issue certificates only
   for those units. unit1.example.com's CA will not be allowed to issue
   a certificate to the host host.unit2.example.com but will be allowed
   to issue a certificate to the host host.unit2.example.com (in truth
   they can issue such certificates but standards-compliant relying
   parties will reject them as violating name constraints placed by
   example.com's CA).  RFC 3280 [2] defines name constraints for
   hierarchical namespaces only.  They can be expressed in terms of
   permitted or excluded subtrees.  Every name type may have a
   corresponding set of name constraints specified higher in the
   certification path although the syntax and semantics of these
   constraints have been defined only for a subset of well-known name
   types and have not been defined at all for others [2]

3.3.  Kerberos Names

   RFC 4556 [4] specializes the type OtherName from RFC 3280 [2] for the
   needs of PKINIT, a protocol integrating X.509 certificate-based
   public key cryptography into the initial authentication exchange with
   Kerberos KDCs.  RFC 4556 sets the type-id field of the type OtherName
   to

   id-pkinit-san OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
       { iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5) kerberosv5(2)
         x509SanAN (2) }

   and redefines the value field of the OtherName as a
   KRB5PrincipalName.  KRB5PrincipalName is defined as

   KRB5PrincipalName ::= SEQUENCE {
       realm            [0] Realm,
       principalName    [1] PrincipalName
   }

   The types Realm and PrincipalName are part of the definition of the
   Kerberos protocol itself given in RFC 4120 [3]:

   Realm           ::= KerberosString

   PrincipalName   ::= SEQUENCE {
       name-type        [0] Int32,
       name-string      [1] SEQUENCE OF KerberosString
   }

   Realm names may be in the style of a DNS domain name, X.500 name,
   "other" and reserved.

   Finally, the name-type field of the type PrincipalName may take one
   of the following values (again per RFC 4120 [3]):

   o  NT-UNKNOWN: Name type not known

   o  NT-PRINCIPAL: Name of the principal

   o  NT-SRV-INST: Service and other unique instance (e.g., krbtgt)

   o  NT-SRV-HST: Host-bound (DNS name) instance of a service (e.g.,
      telnet, r* commands)

   o  NT-SRV-XHST: Host-bound (X.500 name or other) instance of a
      service

   o  NT-UID: Unique ID

   o  NT-X500-PRINCIPAL: Encoded X.509 distinguished name

   o  NT-SMTP-NAME: Name in the form of an SMTP e-mail name (e.g.,
      user@example.com)

4.  Kerberos Name Constraints

4.1.  General

   Kerberos name constraints are defined within the general framework
   for name constraints in X.509 certificates specified in [2].  These
   constraints are applicable only to Kerberos names in the Subject
   Alternative Name extension defined according to RFC 4556 [4].  A
   relying party encountering such a name asserted in an X.509
   certificate MUST apply Kerberos and other name constraints (see
   Section 5) according to the general rules in RFC 3280 [2] and the
   specific rules in this document.

   A Kerberos name constraint has the same basic format as a Kerberos
   name.  This format is defined in RFC 4556 [4]: the type-id field of
   the type OtherName is id-pkinit-san, and the value field of the type
   OtherName is a KRB5PrincipalName.

   This document defines three types of Kerberos name constraints:

   o  Exact full name match: The asserted Kerberos name must exactly
      match the full Kerberos name specified in the constraint.

   o  Exact realm name match: The realm name of the asserted Kerberos
      name must exactly match the realm name specified in the
      constraint.

   o  Suffix realm name match: The suffix of the realm name in the
      asserted Kerberos name must match the realm name specified in the
      constraint.

   Each Kerberos name constraint type is discussed in a separate section
   below.

4.2.  Exact Full Name Match

   An exact full name match occurs when the asserted Kerberos name
   exactly matches the full Kerberos name specified in the constraint.
   A relying party recognizes an exact full name match constraint when
   the value of the name-string field of the type PrincipalName is set
   to a non-empty SEQUENCE.

   Since the name-type field of the type PrincipalName is used only as a
   hint for interpreting the meaning of the name, and it is not
   significant when checking for name equivalence [3], it SHOULD be set
   to NT-UNKNOWN.

   Relying parties MUST use the rules of RFC 4120 [3] to determine if

Internet-Draft         Constraining Kerberos Names        September 2007


   the two Kerberos names (one asserted and the other specified in the
   constraint) match.

   Example 1 (match).  The Kerberos name ("EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-PRINCIPAL,
   ("user1"))) satisfies the exact full name match constraint
   ("EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-UNKNOWN, ("user1"))).

   Example 2 (mismatch).  The Kerberos name ("EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-
   PRINCIPAL, ("user2"))) does not satisfy the exact full name match
   constraint ("EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-UNKNOWN, ("user1"))).

   Example 3 (mismatch).  The Kerberos name ("EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-
   PRINCIPAL, ("user1"))) does not satisfy the exact full name match
   constraint ("EXAMPLE.NET", (NT-UNKNOWN, ("user1"))).

4.3.  Exact Realm Name Match

   An exact realm name match occurs when the realm name of the asserted
   Kerberos name exactly matches the realm name specified in the
   constraint.  A relying party recognizes an exact realm name match
   constraint when the value of the name-string field of the type
   PrincipalName is set to an empty SEQUENCE and the realm field of the
   type KRB5PrincipalName contains a literal realm name (i.e., not a
   pattern as defined in Section 4.4).

   The issuing CA SHOULD set the name-type field of the type
   PrincipalName to NT-UNKNOWN.

   Relying parties MUST use the rules of RFC 4120 [3] to determine if
   the two realm names (one in the asserted Kerberos name and the other
   specified in the constraint) match.

   Example 1 (match).  The Kerberos name ("EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-PRINCIPAL,
   ("user1"))) satisfies the exact realm name match constraint
   ("EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-UNKNOWN, ())).

   Example 2 (mismatch).  The Kerberos name ("EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-
   PRINCIPAL, ("user1"))) does not satisfy the exact realm name match
   constraint ("EXAMPLE.NET", (NT-UNKNOWN, ())).

4.4.  Suffix Realm Name Match

   A suffix realm name match occurs when the suffix of the realm name in
   the asserted Kerberos name matches the realm name specified in the
   constraint.

   Suffix realm name match constraints are defined only for the domain
   and X.500 styles of realm names specified in RFC 4120 [3].  This

   document does not define these name constraints for the "other" and
   reserved realm names from RFC 4120.

   To specify suffix matching for a domain-style realm name, the realm
   field of the type KRB5PrincipalName in the constraint MUST have a
   single "." (dot) character prepended to it.  The rest of the realm
   name MUST be a valid domain-style realm name according to RFC 4120
   [3].  An asserted Kerberos name satisfies a suffix realm name
   constraint if its realm name represents a subdomain of the domain
   specified in the constraint.

   To specify suffix matching for an X.500-style realm name, the realm
   field of the type KRB5PrincipalName in the constraint MUST have a
   single "/" (slash) character appended to it.  The rest of the realm
   name MUST be a valid X.500-style realm name according to RFC 4120
   [3].  An asserted Kerberos name satisfies a suffix realm name
   constraint if its realm name represents a more specific X.500 name
   than the X.500 name specified in the constraint.

   The issuing CA SHOULD set the name-type field of the type
   PrincipalName to NT-UNKNOWN.

   Relying parties MUST use the rules of RFC 4120 [3] to determine if
   the two realm names (one in the asserted Kerberos name and the other
   specified in the constraint) match.

   Example 1 (domain-style realm name, match).  The Kerberos name
   ("REALM1.EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-PRINCIPAL, ("user1"))) satisfies the
   suffix realm name match constraint (".EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-UNKNOWN,
   ())).

   Example 2 (domain-style realm name, mismatch).  The Kerberos name
   ("REALM1.EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-PRINCIPAL, ("user1"))) does not satisfy
   the suffix realm name match constraint (".EXAMPLE.NET", (NT-UNKNOWN,
   ())).

   Example 3 (domain-style realm name, mismatch).  The Kerberos name
   ("EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-PRINCIPAL, ("user1"))) does not satisfy the
   suffix realm name match constraint (".EXAMPLE.COM", (NT-UNKNOWN,
   ())).

   Example 4 (X.500-style realm name, match).  The Kerberos name ("C=US/
   O=OSF/OU=DCE", (NT-PRINCIPAL, ("user1"))) satisfies the suffix realm
   name match constraint ("C=US/O=OSF/", (NT-UNKNOWN, ())).

   Example 5 (X.500-style realm name, mismatch).  The Kerberos name
   ("C=US/O=OSF/OU=DCE", (NT-PRINCIPAL, ("user1"))) does not satisfy the
   suffix realm name match constraint ("C=US/O=OSF1/", (NT-UNKNOWN,

   ())).

   Example 6 (X.500-style realm name, mismatch).  The Kerberos name
   ("C=US/O=OSF", (NT-PRINCIPAL, ("user1"))) does not satisfy the suffix
   realm name match constraint ("C=US/O=OSF/", (NT-UNKNOWN, ())).

5.  Other Name Constraints Applicable to Kerberos Names

5.1.  Overview

   Several types of Kerberos names include components corresponding to
   other name types used in X.509 certificates.  For example, an NT-SRV-
   HST name (the name-string field of the type PrincipalName) consists
   of two components: a service name (e.g., "telnet") and a host name
   [3].  Host names in X.509 certificates are usually constrained using
   the dNSName constraint [2].  Similarly, name constraints defined in
   [2] are applicable to several other Kerberos name types.  Each
   subsection below is dedicated to a single type of name constraint
   from [2] and its applicability to Kerberos names.

5.2.  rfc822Name Name Constraint

   If present, an rfc822Name name constraint SHOULD be applied to all
   asserted Kerberos names with the name-type field of the type
   PrincipalName set to NT-SMTP-NAME.  To satisfy the constraint the
   asserted Kerberos name's name-string field MUST be a SEQUENCE with a
   single element that matches the rfc822Name in the name constraint
   according to the rules of RFC 3280 [2].

5.3.  dNSName Name Constraint

   If present, a dNSName name constraint SHOULD be applied to all
   asserted Kerberos names with the name-type field of the type
   PrincipalName set to NT-SRV-HST.  To satisfy the constraint the
   asserted Kerberos name's name-string field MUST be a SEQUENCE with
   two elements the second of which matches the dNSName in the name
   constraint according to the rules of RFC 3280 [2].

5.4.  x400Address Name Constraint

   Not applicable.

5.5.  directoryName Name Constraint

   If present, a directoryName name constraint SHOULD be applied to all
   asserted Kerberos names with the name-type field of the type
   PrincipalName set to NT-SRV-XHST and to all asserted Kerberos names
   with the name-type field of the type PrincipalName set to NT-X500-
   PRINCIPAL.

   To satisfy the constraint the asserted NT-X500-PRINCIPAL Kerberos
   name's name-string field MUST represent a valid sequence of string
   representations of relative distinguished names and MUST match the
   directoryName in the name constraint according to the rules of RFC

   3280 [2].

   To satisfy the constraint the asserted NT-SRV-XHST Kerberos name's
   name-string field MUST be a SEQUENCE with at least two components all
   but the first of which represent relative distinguished names [6]
   and, taken together, match the directoryName in the name constraint
   according to the rules of RFC 3280 [2].

5.6.  uniformResourceIdentifier Name Constraint

   Not applicable.

5.7.  iPAddress Name Constraint

   Not applicable.

6.  Security Considerations

   The IT infrastructures of many organizations use Kerberos names as a
   primary name form for end entities (e.g., users).  Used in X.509
   certificates a Kerberos name can provide a unique and stable end-
   entity identifier in PKI-aware non-Kerberized applications.  It can
   also be used for cross-enterprise certificate-based authentication to
   uniquely identify external users.

   X.509 name constraints allow Certification Authorities to restrict
   namespaces used by subordinate and other CAs to which they issue
   certificates: such CAs may issue certificates only to entities within
   their sphere of authority.  Name constraints provide one mechanism to
   specify these spheres.  As Kerberos names gain in importance, the
   notion of name constraints should be extended to Kerberos names as
   well.  This document stipulates that relying parties MUST verify
   asserted Kerberos names against the Kerberos name constraints present
   in certificates located higher in the certification path.

   RFC 3280 [2] requires name constraints to be marked critical.  It
   means that a relying party not aware of Kerberos name constraints
   MUST fail validation and declare the end-entity certificate invalid.

   Non-Kerberos name constraints may also apply to Kerberos names.  It
   is RECOMMENDED that relying parties apply these name constraints as
   described in Section 5.  Relying parties should keep in mind that NT-
   SMTP-NAMEs may represent names that are not, in fact, RFC 822 e-mail
   addresses but only look like e-mail addresses.  Similarly, an NT-
   X500-PRINCIPAL name may look like a valid sequence of relative
   distinguished names but not represent any real distinguished name.

   Finally, since the definition of name equivalence does not include
   the name-type field of the type PrincipalName [3], issuing CAs may
   circumvent the application of non-Kerberos name constraints by
   labeling the asserted Kerberos names as NT-PRINCIPALs or other name
   types not subject to such constraints.  If validation of these
   constraints is of utmost importance to a relying party it SHOULD
   trust only those CAs whose Certificate Policies include language
   guaranteeing the proper use of Kerberos names in X.509 certificates
   by subordinate and other CAs downstream; such language SHOULD be
   enforced by proper auditing procedures.  See RFC 3647 [5] for details
   on Certificate Policies.
