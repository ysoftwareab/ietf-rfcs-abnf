Internet-Draft             BRDP Based Routing              November 2008


1.  Introduction

   With the growth of the Internet, the routing table in the Internet
   Default Free Zone (DFZ) is becoming unacceptably large.  One of the
   reasons is usage of Provider Independent (PI) Address blocks in edge
   networks.  A remedy is encouragement of Provider Aggregatable (PA)
   Addresses.  Unfortunately, PA addresses and multi-homing may
   introduce some problems if not carefully planned and configured
   [RFC3704].

   In a stable network, multi-homing with PA addresses can be supported
   by configuring routing, tunneling, filtering or other mechanisms.  In
   a more dynamic world, this is less practical and needs improvement.
   In a MANET [RFC2501], manual configuration is infeasible.

   The Border Router Discovery Protocol (BRDP) [I-D.boot-autoconf-brdp]
   provides a mechanism for Address Autoconfiguration in ad hoc networks
   and may support automatic renumbering.  In addition, a mechanism is
   needed for ensuring that traffic is directed to a Border Router that
   corresponds with the source address.  This will circumvent problems
   with ingress filtering, as described in [RFC5220] section 2.1.2.

   BRDP Based Routing provides a mechanism for packet delivery to Border
   Routers that correspond with the source addresses of the packets.
   This mechanism is applied for traffic that is not destined for
   interior nodes of the edge network.  It replaces the default route
   mechanism.

   The BRDP Based Routing mechanism also provides basic support for load
   distribution over multiple Border Routers.  More advanced load
   balancing can be provided for multi-homed hosts, provisioned with
   transport layer facilities that utilize multi-homing.


2.  Problems with default gateway routing

   Usually, the nexthop selection is based on the destination address.
   In case of default gateway routing and multiple exit routers to
   multiple providers, the source has no influence on what exit router
   is used.  In case of ingress filtering and lack of a mechanism to
   redirect packets to exit routers that correspond to the source
   address, packets may be dropped.

   This default gateway routing behavior blocks incremental enhancement
   of the Internet, e.g. through the addition of support for more
   dynamic networks and / or host based load distribution mechanisms.
   In a MANET, it also also prevents the use of make-before-break
   [RFC3753] mechanisms.

3.  Default gateway routing replaced with BRDP Based Routing

   Default gateway based routing for IPv4 is defined in [RFC1812],
   section 5.2.4.3:


     (5) Default Route: This is a route to all networks for which there
          are no explicit routes.  It is by definition the route whose
          prefix length is zero.


   With BRDP Based Routing, another type of route is introduced:


     (6) BRDP Route: This is a route to all networks for which there
            are no explicit routes, and  a default route is not used.
            The nexthop IP address is found by means of a Border Router
            Information Cache (BRIO-Cache) lookup based on the source
            address and, if a matching BRIO-Cache entry is found, a
            subsequent FIB lookup based on the selected Border Router
            address.


   Note that route types (3) and (4) are not defined in RFC1812.

   BRDP Based Routing can be turned on and off with the existence of a
   default route in the IGP.  This switch function might be useful in
   migration scenarios towards BRDP Based Routing.

   The Border Router should run the IGP on the interface with the BRDP
   advertized Border Router address.

   In the edge network, all interior routers should run BRDP and BRDP
   Based Routing.  All interior routers will have a BRIO-Cache
   [I-D.boot-autoconf-brdp] with information for selecting Border
   Routers as exit points to the Internet.  A BRIO-Cache entry contains
   a Border Router address and a summary prefix assigned to that Border
   Router.  BRIO-Cache lookup follows the longest-match rule.

   Forwarding is solely based on FIB lookups, the nexthop IP address is
   found either by a FIB lookup with the destination address or by a FIB
   lookup with the address of the Border Router that corresponds with
   the source address.  If the nexthop IP address lookup fails, the
   packet is discarded.

4.  Support for IPv4

   BRDP-based Address Autoconfiguration is designed for IP version 6.
   Support for IP version 4 will be taken into consideration.


5.  IANA considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   BRDP Based Routing depends on BRDP and the IGP used.  BRDP depends on
   security mechanisms provided by ND [RFC4861].  ND can be secured by
   SeND [RFC3971].  IGPs are assumed to have their own security
   mechanisms.

   More research on security issues for BRDP Based Routing is needed.


7.  Acknowledgments

   BRDP is inspired by MANEMO technology; thanks to all who contributed
   to it.  Thanks to Ran Atkinson, who guided me towards a BRDP Based
   Routing mechanism that does not rely on routing headers or
   encapsulation.  And thanks to Ronald in 't Velt for reviewing.
