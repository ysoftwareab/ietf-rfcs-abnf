1 The Network Management Framework


The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
components.  They are:



    RFC 1155 defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
    and naming objects for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212
    defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly
    consistent with the SMI.

    RFC 1156 defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for the
    Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213 [1] defines MIB-II, an
    evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new
    operational requirements.

    RFC 1157 defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access
    to managed objects.

    RFC 1442 [2] defines the SMI for version 2 of the Simple
    Network Management Protocol.

    RFCs 1443 and 1444 [3,4] define Textual Conventions and
    Conformance Statements for version 2 of the Simple Network
    Management Protocol.

    RFC 1452 [5] describes how versions 1 and 2 of the Simple
    Network Management Protocol should coexist.


The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
experimentation and evaluation.

2 Objects


Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are defined using
the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [6] defined in the
SMI. In particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.
The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name,
which specifies an object type.  The object type together with an object
instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the
object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed
the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for this
purpose.  However, the SMI [2] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs
which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made for
simplicity.

The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type is
represented when being transmitted on the network.

The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [7],
subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.



2.1 Format of Definitions


Section 4 contains contains the specification of all object types
contained in this MIB module.  These object types are defined using the
conventions defined in [2] and [3].



3 Overview


Internet Accounting seeks to provide a well-defined method for
collecting traffic flow information from internetworks.  The background
for this is given in RFC 1272 [8].  The Working Group has produced an
Accounting Architecture to achieve it, which is documented in an
Internet Draft [9].  The architecture defines three entities:


  - METERS, which observe network traffic flows and build up a table of
    information about them



Nevil Brownlee                                                  [Page 3]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Accounting Meter Services MIB        November 1994

  - COLLECTORS, which collect traffic flow data from meters, and

  - MANAGERS, which oversee the operation of meters and collectors.



This memo defines the internet-accounting object, which is an SNMP
realisation of an accounting meter.

The internet-accounting object contains control, counter and state
information related to the performance of the accounting function.  In
particular, the meter is assumed to be one which forwards PDUs, like a
router, (counting PDUs as they enter or leave the device), or monitors
the passage of PDUs, like a LAN monitor.  The results are contain in
FlowEntrys which are contained in the internet-accounting object.  A
managed system will have exactly (zero or) one internet-accounting
object.


3.1 Scope of Definitions, Textual Conventions


All objects defined in this memo are registered in a single subtree
within the experimental namespace [2], and are for use in network
devices which may perform a PDU forwarding or monitoring function.  For
these devices, the value of the ifSpecific variable in the MIB-II [1]
has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

internet-accounting OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  experimental 99

as defined below.

At the time work was begun on this MIB the above OID was used purely as
a placeholder.  Later implementations have used it in the (mistaken)
belief that it had been asigned by IANA. An application has since been
made to IANA for a 'proper' OID.

The Accounting MIB was first produced and tested using SNMPv1.  It has
been converted into SNMPv2 following the guidelines in RFC 1452 [5].



3.2 Usage of the MIB variables


The MIB breaks into four parts - control, flows, rules and actions.

The rules implement the minumum set of actions, as set out in the
Accounting Architecture document [8].  In addition they provide for
BASIC-style subroutines, allowing a network manager to dramatically
reduce the number of rules required to monitor a big network.


Nevil Brownlee                                                  [Page 4]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Accounting Meter Services MIB        November 1994

Actions provide prototypes for traffic flows.  When a packet is matched
by the rules for the first time, an action is used to create the flow's
entry in the flow table.  Actions therefore have the same basic format
as flows.

Traffic flows are identified by a set of attributes for each of its
end-points.  Attributes include network addresses for each layer of the
network protocol stack, and 'subscriber ids,' which may be used to
identify an accountable entity for the flow.

To retrieve flow data one could simply do a linear scan of the flow
table.  This would certainly work, but would require a lot of protocol
exchanges.  To reduce the overhead in retrieving flow data, there are
three 'windows' into the flow table.  The 'creation' window makes it
easy to find those flows created after a given time, the 'activity'
window finds flows active since a given time; these two allow retrieval
of flow data without using an opaque object.

The third window is the AcctActivityColumnEntry, which uses three
indexes to retrieve (in an opaque object) values for many flows for any
combination of attribute, activity time and starting flow number.  This
allows a collector to retrieve data for a column of the flow table with
a minimum of SNMP overhead.  An attempt has been made to include a full
asn.1 definition of the AcctActivityColumnEntry object.

One aspect of data collection which needs emphasis is that all the MIB
variables are set up to allow multiple independent colletors to work
properly, i.e.  the flow table windows are stateless.  An alternative
approach would have been to 'snapshot' the flow table, which would mean
that the collectors would have to be synchronised.  The stateless
approach does mean that two collectors will never return exactly the
same set of traffic counts, but over long periods (e.g.  15-minute
collections over a day) the discrepancies are acceptable.  If one really
needs a snapshot, this can be achieved by switching to an identical rule
table with a different ruleset number, hence asynchronous collections
may be regarded as a useful generalisation of synchronised ones.

The control variables are the minimum set required for a collector.
Their number has been whittled down as experience has been gained with
the MIB implementation.

-- Within an address tuple the mask attributes are used to specify
-- which parts of the addresses must match exactly when address tuples
-- are compared.  For example peer type = ipaddress, peer address =
-- 130.216.0.0, peer mask = 255.255.0.0 would match any peer address
-- representing an IP interface within network 130.216.

-- As an example of types and values, here is an address tuple for a
-- flow carrying a stream of SMTP data over an ethernet:
--    adjacent type = ethernet,  adjacent address = 02-07-01-04-ED-4A
--    peer type = IP, peer address = 130.216.240.7
--    transport type = TCP, transport address = 25 (port number)

-- The Network Address construct:
-- The intent here is that this address type represent a choice of N-1
-- layer addresses based on the protocol layer at which accounting is
-- done.  For example, if accounting is being performed at the
-- presentation level, then this address might be a session layer
-- address; if done at the network level it might be an IP address.
-- The level at which accounting is done is the "peer" level, N.

-- In the following, "adjacent" means the level below the current level
-- and "transport" means the level above it.  For IP, the adjacent
-- layer address might be the ethernet or 802 MAC layer address.  A
-- better encoding convention may be needed so that addresses at any
-- layer can be specified unambiguously.

--
-- The Flow Table
--

-- This is a table kept by a meter, with one entry for every flow
-- currently being accounted for.

-- The variables kept for each flow comprise:
--      Housekeeping information for the flow.
--      The flow's "counters", i.e. its octet and PDU counts for each
--              direction and its first and last packet times.
--      The flow's "keys", i.e. the information used to distinguish
--              packets for this particular flow.

-- Each flow has at least one key, but "aggregate" flows may have more
-- than one key.  Every key is associated with a single flow, and every
-- PDU matching a key is counted in its associated flow's counters.

-- Each packet which arrives at a meter is examined, and values for all
-- the "key" variables are extracted and assembled into a "packet key".
-- The set of current keys is searched to see whether this flow has
-- already been seen.  If it has, the packet is simply counted;
-- if not, the rules are consulted to create a new flow in which this
-- packet may be counted.  Once a flow has been created in this way a
-- collector will have to read the flow's key data just once.  After
-- that the collector needs only to read the flow's counts from time to
-- time.

-- Each key has two AddressTuples, one for each of its end points.
-- Flows are bidirectional and have two sets of counters, one for each
-- of the two possible directions.  Since we may be accounting for
-- packets observed in transit along a network segment the choice of
-- "to" and "from" direction is arbitrary; "source" and "destination"
-- (abbreviated to "dest" elsewhere in this MIB) are specified for each
-- flow by the rules in the current rule set.  In the special case
-- where the address tuples are identical all packets are counted in
-- the "to" direction's counters.

-- From time to time a collector may sweep the flow table so as collect
-- counts.  To reduce the number of SNMP requests required to do this,
-- two further tables provide alternative windows into the flow table.
-- The Creation Table allows a collector to find the first entry created
-- after a specified time, then make successive getnext requests to find
-- all other entries created since that time.  Similarly, the Activity
-- Table allows a collector to find all the entries last counted after
-- a specified time.  Note that it is not sensible for the meter to
-- keep the Activity Table in LastTime order, since that would result
-- in very active flows being counted many times during the same
-- collection.

-- This scheme allows multiple collectors to independently use the same

-- meter; the collectors do not have to be synchronised and they may
-- use different collection intervals.

-- A meter may reclaim the memory space used by flows (or keys) for
-- which no packets have been seen since lastCollectTime, or for an
-- interval longer than the inactivityTimeout, whichever is the longer.
-- The meter may reuse flow indexes for flows thus reclaimed.

        Tally(2) adds the PDU into a tally based on the ActionEntry
            acctAction[acctRuleJumpIndex].  Each flow in a Tally is a

            ActionEntry.
        Aggregate(3) adds the PDU into an aggregate based on the
            ActionEntry acctAction[acctRuleJumpIndex].  There is only
            one flow in an aggregate; it is a copy of its ActionEntry.

        Succeed(4) has two effects, depending on the RuleJumpIndex
            value.  If this is zero, rule matching stops and a
            successful match is reported.  The PDU will not be counted,
            and the meter will not try to match it again.
            If the RuleJumpIndex is not zero, it specifies a target
            rule.  The action for the target rule is executed
            immediately, as though that rule had just succeeded.
        Fail(5) terminates rule matching and indicates that the PDU
            was not matched.  The meter may try to match it again, for
            example with the source and dest keys interchanged.

        Pushto(6) tells the meter to use RuleJumpIndex as the index of
            the next rule to match.  It also pushes the current rule
            index onto the pattern stack.
        Popto(7) tells the meter to use RuleJumpIndex as the index of
            the next rule to match.  It also deletes the top entry
            from the pattern stack.
        Goto(8) tells the meter to use RuleJumpIndex as the index of
            the next rule to match.  The pattern stack is not changed.

        GoSub(9) calls a rule-matching subroutine.  RuleJumpIndex is
            used as the index of the next rule to match, and the meter
            pushes the current rule index+1 onto the return stack.
        Return(10) returns from a rule-matching subroutine.  The return
            rule index is popped from the return stack and added to
            RuleJumpIndex to select a target rule.  The action for the
            target rule is executed immediately, allowing rule-matching
            subroutines to return a result.
        Assign(11) sets the value of a meter variable.  The variable is
           specified by acctRuleSelector, and its value is set to
           RuleJumpIndex."
