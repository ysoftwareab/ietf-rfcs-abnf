Abstract

   The content of many communication services depend on the context,
   such as the user's location.  We describe a 'service' URN that allows
   to register such context-dependent services that can be resolved in a
   distributed manner.

Internet-Draft                 Service URN                    April 2006


1.  Introduction

   In existing telecommunications systems, there are many well-known
   communication and information services that are offered by loosely
   coordinated entities across a large geographic region, with well-
   known identifiers.  Some of the services are operated by governments
   or regulated monopolies, others by competing commercial enterprises.
   Examples include emergency services (reached by dialing 911 in North
   America, 112 in Europe), community services and volunteer
   opportunities (211 in some regions of the United States),telephone
   directory and repair services (411 and 611 in the United States and
   Canada), government information services (311 in some cities in the
   United States), lawyer referral services (1-800-LAWYER), car roadside
   assistance (automobile clubs) and pizza delivery services.
   Unfortunately, almost all of them are limited in scope to a single
   country or possibly a group of countries, such as those belonging to
   the North American Numbering Plan or the European Union.  The same
   identifiers are often used for other purposes outside that region,
   making accessing such services difficult when users travel or use
   devices produced outside their home country.

   These services are characterized by long-term stability of user-
   visible identifiers, decentralized administration of the underlying
   service and a well-defined resolution mechanism.  (For example, there
   is no national coordination or call center for "9-1-1" in the United
   States; rather, various local government organizations cooperate to
   provide this service, based on jurisdictions.)

   In this document, we propose a URN namespace that, together with
   resolution protocols beyond the scope of this document, allows to
   define such global, well-known services, while distributing the
   actual implementation across a large number of service-providing
   entities.  There are many ways to divide provision of such services,
   such as dividing responsibility by geographic region or by the
   service provider a user chooses.  In addition, users can choose
   different directory providers that in turn manage how geographic
   locations are mapped to service providers.

   Availability of such service identifiers simplifies end system
   configuration.  For example, an IP phone could have a special set of
   short cuts or buttons that invoke emergency services, as it would not
   be practical to manually re-configure the device with local emergency
   contacts for each city or town a user visits with his or her mobile
   device.  Also, such identifiers allow to delegate routing decisions
   to third parties and mark certain requests as having special
   characteristics while preventing these characteristics to be
   accidentally invoked on inappropriate requests.

Internet-Draft                 Service URN                    April 2006


   This URN allows to identify services independent of a particular
   protocol to deliver the services.  It may appear in protocols that
   allow general URIs, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [5]
   request URIs, web pages or mapping protocols.

   The service URN is generally not expected to be visible to humans.
   For example, it is expected that callers will still dial '9-1-1' in
   the United States to reach emergency services.  In some other cases,
   speed dial buttons might identify the service, as is common practice
   on hotel phones today.  (Speed dial buttons for summoning emergency
   help are considered inappropriate by most emergency services
   professionals, at least for mobile devices, as they are too prone to
   being triggered accidentally.)  Rather, protocol elements would carry
   the service URN described here, allowing universal identification.
   The translation of dial strings to service URNs is beyond the scope
   of this document; it is likely to depend on the location of the
   caller and may be many-to-one.  For example, a phone for a traveler
   could recognize the emergency dial string for both the traveler's
   home location and the traveler's visited location, translating both
   to the same universal service URN, urn:service:sos.

   Since service URNs are not routable, a proxy or user agent has to
   translate the service URN into a routable URI for a location-
   appropriate service provider, such as a SIP URL.  LoST [20] is one
   resolution system for mapping service URNs to URLs based on
   geographic location.  It is anticipated that there will be several
   such systems, possibly with different systems for different services.

   We discuss alternative approaches, and why they are unsatisfactory,
   in Appendix A.

2.  Registration Template

   Below, we include the registration template for the URN scheme
   according to RFC 3406 [15].
   Namespace ID: service
   Registration Information: Registration version: 1; registration date:
      2006-04-02
   Declared registrant of the namespace: TBD
   Declaration of syntactic structure: The URN consists of a
      hierarchical service identifier, with a sequence of labels
      separated by periods.  The left-most label is the most significant
      one and is called 'top-level service', while names to the right
      are called 'sub-services'.  The set of allowable characters is the
      same as that for domain names [1] and a subset of the labels
      allowed in [6]; labels are case-insensitive and SHOULD be
      specified in all lower-case.  Any string of service labels can be
      used to request services that are either more generic or more

      specific.  In other words, if a service 'x.y.z' exists, the URNs
      'x' and 'x.y' are also valid service URNs.

     "URN:service:" service
     service            = top-level *("." service-identifier)
     let-dig            = ALPHA / DIGIT
     let-dig-hyp        = let-dig / '-'
     service-identifier = let-dig [ *let-dig-hyp let-dig ]
     top-level          = let-dig [ *25let-dig-hyp let-dig ]

   Relevant ancillary documentation: None
   Community considerations: The service URN is believe to be relevant
      to a large cross-section of Internet users, including both
      technical and non-technical users, on a variety of devices, but
      particularly for mobile and nomadic users.  The service URN will
      allow Internet users needing services to identify the service by
      kind, without having to determine manually who provides the
      particular service in the user's current context, e.g., at his
      current location.  For example, a traveler will be able to use his
      mobile device to request emergency services without having to know
      the local emergency number.  The assignment of identifiers is
      described in the IANA Considerations (Section 4).  The service URN
      does not prescribe a particular resolution mechanism, but it is
      assumed that a number of different entities could operate and
      offer such mechanisms.
   Namespace considerations: There do not appear to be other URN
      namespaces that serve the same need of uniquely identifying
      widely-available communication and information services.  Unlike
      most other currently registered URN namespaces, the service URN
      does not identify documents and protocol objects (e.g., [13],
      [14], [18], [19]), types of telecommunications equipment [17],
      people or organizations [12]. tel URIs [16] identify telephone
      numbers, but numbers commonly identifying services, such as 911 or
      112, are specific to a particular region or country.
   Identifier uniqueness considerations: A service URN identifies a
      logical service, specified in the service registration (see IANA
      considerations).  Resolution of the URN, if successful, will
      return a particular instance of the service, and this instance may
      be different even for two users making the same request in the
      same place at the same time; the logical service identified by the
      URN, however, is persistent and unique.  Service URNs MUST be
      unique for each unique service; this is guaranteed through the
      registration of each service within this namespace, described in
      Section 4.

Internet-Draft                 Service URN                    April 2006


   Identifier persistence considerations: The 'service' URN for the same
      service is expected to be persisent, although there naturally
      cannot be a guarantee that a particular service will continue to
      be available globally or at all times.
   Process of identifier assignment: The process of identifier
      assignment is described in the IANA Considerations (Section 4).
   Process for identifier resolution: 'service' identifiers are resolved
      by the mapping protocols, an instance of a Resolution Discovery
      System (RDS) as described in RFC 2276 [3].  Each top-level service
      can provide its own distinct set of mapping protocols.  Within
      each top-level service, all mapping protocols MUST return the same
      set of mappings.  Section 3 describes how DNS NAPTR records are
      used to find an instance of a mapping service.
   Rules for Lexical Equivalence: 'service' identifiers are compared
      according to case-insensitive string equality.
   Conformance with URN Syntax: There are no special considerations.
   Validation mechanism: The RDS mechanism is also used to validate the
      existence of a resource.  As noted, by its design, the
      availability of a resource may depend on where service is desired
      and there may not be service available in all or most locations.
      (For example, roadside assistance service is unlikely to be
      available on about 70% of the earth's surface.)
   Scope: The scope for this URN is public and global.

3.  Finding the Mapping Server

   When a network entity receives a service URN, it uses the S-NAPTR [6]
   mechanism to determine how to map the service URN, possibly using
   other information such as geographic location, to a routable URI.
   Each top-level service may define one or more such mapping protocols
   and mapping protocol servers may be operated by a range of providers.
   Thus, the network entity that needs to resolve the service URN
   queries an appropriate domain, typically its home or service provider
   domain, for NAPTR records and then selects records that match the
   service and the mapping protocols it supports.  The application
   service for this URN is registered in IANA Considerations (Section 4)
   of this document; the application protocols are registered in the
   appropriate protocol document.

   The S-NAPTR entry MAY contain the "s" flag if the resolving client
   needs to perform an SRV resolution on the replacement string.

   The first entry in the following example indicates that 'sos' service
   URNs should be mapped to URIs using the LoST [20] protocol server at
   lost.example.com, a DNS A record.  The second entry is for an
   imaginary top-level service 'pizza', using the equally imagined
   'Pizza Location Protocol', offered by the pizzahouse.example.net
   server, which should be queried for the appropriate DNS SRV record.

   Note that these NAPTR records are maintained by example.com, i.e.,
   example.com does not actually provide the mapping service itself.

   IN NAPTR 10 50 "s" "SURN.pizza:PLP"  ""
      _plp._tcp.pizzahouse.example.net



4.  IANA Considerations

4.1  New Service-Identifying Tokens

   New service-identifying tokens and sub-registrations are to be
   managed by IANA, according to the processes outlined in [4].  The
   policy for top-level service names is 'IETF Consensus'.  The policy
   for assigning names to sub-services may differ for each top-level
   service designation and MUST be defined by the document describing
   the top-level service.

   To allow use within the constraints of S-NAPTR [6], all top-level
   service names MUST NOT exceed 27 characters.

4.2  S-NAPTR Application Service Label

   Since each top-level service could use one or more different
   resolution protocols, we need to indicate the top-level service in
   the S-NAPTR application service label.  To indicate the URN-to-
   service mapping service, all such services start with the string
   "SURN." (for "service URN"), followed by the top-level service
   identifier.  Note that application service labels are case-
   insensitive and rendered here in mixed case purely for readability.

   This document registers the label "SURN.sos" as the S-NAPTR
   application service label according to [6] for emergency services and
   defines the intended usage, interoperability considerations and
   security considerations (Section 5).

4.3  sos Service Types

   The 'sos' service type describes emergency services and services
   related to public safety and health, typically offered by various
   branches of the government or other public institutions.  Additional

Internet-Draft                 Service URN                    April 2006


   sub-services can be added after expert review and should be of
   general public interest.

   urn:service:sos The generic 'sos' service reaches a public safety
      answering point (PSAP), that in turn dispatches aid appropriate to
      the emergency.  It encompasses all of the services listed below.
   urn:service:sos.ambulance This service identifier reaches an
      ambulance service that provides emergency medical assistance and
      transportation.
   urn:service:sos.animal-control Animal control is defined as control
      of dogs, cats, and domesticated or undomesticated animals.
   urn:service:sos.fire The 'fire' service identifier summons the fire
      service, also known as the fire brigade or fire department.
   urn:service:sos.gas The 'gas' service allows the reporting of natural
      gas (and other flammable gas) leaks or other natural gas
      emergencies.
   urn:service:sos.mountain The 'mountain' service refers to mountain
      rescue services, i.e., search and rescue activities that occur in
      a mountainous environment, although the term is sometimes also
      used to apply to search and rescue in other wilderness
      environments.
   urn:service:sos.marine The 'marine' service refers to maritime search
      and rescue services such as those offered by the coast guard,
      lifeboat or surf lifesavers.
   urn:service:sos.physician The 'physician' emergency service connects
      the caller to a physician referral service.
   urn:service:sos.poison The 'poison' service refers to special
      information centers set up to inform citizens about how to respond
      to potential poisoning.  These poison control centers maintain a
      database of poisons and appropriate emergency treatment.
   urn:service:sos.police The 'police' service refers to the police
      department or other law enforcement authorities.
   urn:service:sos.suicide The 'suicide' service refers to the suicide
      prevention hotline.
   urn:service:sos.mental-health The 'mental-health' service refers to
      the "Diagnostic, treatment, and preventive care that helps improve
      how persons with mental illness feel both physically and
      emotionally as well as how they interact with other persons."
      (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services)

5.  Security Considerations

   As an identifier, the service URN does not appear to raise any
   particular security issues.  The services described by the URN are
   meant to be well-known, even if the particular service instance is
   access-controlled, so privacy considerations do not apply to the URN.
   There are likely no specific privacy issues when including a service
   URN on a web page, for example.  On the other hand, ferrying the URN

   in a signaling protocol can give attackers information on the kind of
   service desired by the caller.  For example, this makes it easier for
   the attacker to automatically find all calls for emergency services
   or directory assistance.  Appropriate, protocol-specific security
   mechanisms need to be implemented for protocols carrying service
   URNs.  The mapping protocol needs to address a number of threats, as
   detailed in [21].

Appendix A.  Alternative Approaches Considered

   The "sos" SIP URI reserved user name proposed here follows the
   convention of RFC 2142 [8] and the "postmaster" convention documented
   in RFC 2822 [10].  The approach has the advantage that only the home
   proxy for a user needs to understand the convention and that the
   mechanism is likely backwards-compatible with most SIP user agents,
   with the only requirement that they have to be able to generate
   alphanumeric URLs.  One drawback is that it may conflict with locally
   assigned addresses of the form "sos@domain".  Also, if proxies not
   affiliated with the domain translate the URL, they violate the
   current SIP protocol conventions.

   There are a number of possible alternatives, each with their own set
   of advantages and problems:

   tel:NNN;context=+C This approach uses tel URIs [16].  Here, NNN is
      the national emergency number, where the country is identified by
      the context C. This approach is easy for user agents to implement,
      but hard for proxies and other SIP elements to recognize, as it
      would have to know about all number-context combinations in the
      world and track occasional changes.  In addition, many of these
      numbers are being used for other services.  For example, the
      emergency number in Paraguay (00) is also used to call the
      international operator in the United States.  A number of
      countries, such as Italy, use 118 as an emergency number, but it
      also connects to directory assistance in Finland.
   tel:sos This solution avoids name conflicts, but is not a valid "tel"
      [16] URI.  It also only works if every outbound proxy knows how to
      route requests to a proxy that can reach emergency services since
      tel URIs.  The SIP URI proposed here only requires a user's home
      domain to be appropriately configured.

   sip:sos@domain Earlier work had defined a special user identifier,
      sos, within the caller's home domain in a SIP URI, for example,
      sip:sos@example.com.  This approach had the advantage that dial
      plans in existing user agents could probably be converted to
      generate such a URI and that only the home proxy for the domain
      has to understand the user naming convention.  However, it
      overloads the user part of the URI with specific semantics rather
      than being opaque, makes routing by the outbound proxy a special
      case that does not conform to normal SIP request-URI handling
      rules and is SIP-specific.  The mechanism also does not extend
      readily to other services.
   SIP URI user parameter: One could create a special URI, such as "aor-
      domain;user=sos".  This avoids the name conflict problem, but
      requires mechanism-aware user agents that are capable of emitting
      this special URI.  Also, the 'user' parameter is meant to describe
      the format of the user part of the SIP URI, which this usage does
      not do.  Adding other parameters still leaves unclear what, if
      any, conventions should be used for the user and domain part of
      the URL.  Neither solution is likely to be backward-compatible
      with existing clients.
   Special domain: A special domain, such as "sip:fire@sos.int" could be
      used to identify emergency calls.  This has similar properties as
      the "tel:sos" URI, except that it is indeed a valid URI.  To make
      this usable, the special domain would have to be operational and
      point to an appropriate emergency services proxy.  Having a
      single, if logical, emergency services proxy for the whole world
      seems to have undesirable scaling and administrative properties.
