   1 Status of this Memo 
    
   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with 
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.  
    
   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering 
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that 
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts.  Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of 
   six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other 
   documents at any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts 
   as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in 
   progress."  
   The list of current Internet-Drafts can be accessed at 
   http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-abstracts.txt

   2 Abstract 
    
   This document is to allow the inclusion of a digital signature within 
   the SCTP [RFC2960] packet.  This digital signature, or digest, would 
   be negotiated on a per Association basis.  The means of negotiation 
   and use is beyond the scope of this document. 
    
    
   3 Integrity-Authentication Digest 
    
   This chunk is used to verify integrity a SCTP packet.  This chunk is 
   placed as the last chunk within the SCTP packet.  The digest is 
   created over the entire SCTP packet with the Digest Value zeroed.  To 
   assist generalized processing, an IANA Designator for the type of 
   digest algorithm used is placed within the Chunk Flag region.  The 
   calculated Digest Value then replaces this zeroed region.  The format 
   of the IA-Digest chunk is shown below:
