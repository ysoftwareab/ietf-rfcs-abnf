     Abstract 

     IANA has defined an "OTN Signal Type" subregistry to the 
     "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling 
     Parameters" registry. This subregistry does not specify Expert 
     Review or Private ranges. This draft proposes changes to OTN Signal 
     Type subregistry to include Expert Review and Private ranges.

     1. Introduction 

        With the evolution and deployment of Optical Transport Network 
        (OTN) technology, it is necessary to support additional signal 
        types ODU1e, ODU3e1 and ODU3e2 mentioned in [G.Sup43]. However, 
        as these signal types are only defined in an ITU-T supplementary 
        document, IANA cannot allocate values from the "Standards 
        Action" range [RFC5226].  

        IANA maintains "OTN Signal Type" subregistry to the "Generalized 
        Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" 
        registry for the OTN signal defined in [RFC4328] and [RFC7139]. 
        However, this subregistry does not specify Expert Review or 
        Private ranges. This draft proposes changes to OTN Signal Type 
        subregistry to include Expert Review and Private ranges.

     2. IANA Considerations  

        IANA has defined an "OTN Signal Type" subregistry to the 
        "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling 
        Parameters" registry. This document modifies OTN Signal Type 
        subregistry by including the following ranges for Expert Review 
        and private use. Both ranges come from the "Unassigned" value 
        space in [RFC4328] and [RFC7139].  

        The registry is modified as follows: 

              Value    Signal Type                           Reference 

              -----    -----------                           --------- 

              23-229   A range assigned under the         [This draft] 
                       "Unassigned" policy described  
                       in [RFC5226].        
              230-234  A range assigned under the         [This draft] 
                       "Experimental" policy described  
                       in [RFC5226].        
              235-239  A range assigned under the         [This draft] 
                       "Private Use" policy described  
                       in [RFC5226].        
              240-255   A range assigned under the         [This draft] 
                       "Unassigned" policy described  
                       in [RFC5226].
