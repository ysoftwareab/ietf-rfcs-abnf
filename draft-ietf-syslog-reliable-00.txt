Abstract

   The SYSLOG protocol[1] describes a number of service options related
   to propagating event messages. This memo describes two mappings of
   the syslog protocol to TCP connections, both useful for reliable
   delivery of event messages. The first provides a trivial mapping
   maximizing backward compatibility. The second provides a more
   complete mapping. Both provide a degree of robustness and security
   in message delivery that is unavailable to the usual UDP-based
   syslog protocol, by providing encryption and authentication over the
   TCP connection.

1. Introduction

   The syslog protocol[1] presents a spectrum of service options for
   provisioning an event-based logging service over a network. Each
   option has associated benefits and costs. Accordingly, the choice as
   to what combination of options is provisioned is both an engineering
   and administrative decision. This memo describes how to realize the
   syslog protocol when reliable delivery is selected as a required
   service. It is beyond the scope of this memo to argue for, or
   against, the use of reliable delivery for the syslog protocol.

2. The Model

   The syslog service supports three roles of operation: device, relay,
   and collector.

   Devices and collectors act as sources and sinks, respectively, of
   syslog entries. In the simplest case, only a device and collector
   are present. E.g.,

     +--------+        +-----------+
     | Device | -----> | Collector |
     +--------+        +-----------+

   The relationship between devices and collectors is potentially
   many-to-many. I.e., a device might communicate with many collectors;
   similarly, a collector might communicate with many devices. 

   A relay operates in both modes, accepting syslog entries from
   devices and other relays and forwarding those entries to collectors
   and other relays. 

   For example,

     +--------+        +-------+        +-----------+
     | Device | -----> | Relay | -----> | Collector |
     +--------+        +-------+        +-----------+

   Of course, more than one relay may be present between any particular
   device and collector. 

   To provide reliable delivery when realizing the syslog protocol,
   this memo defines two BEEP profiles. BEEP[2] is a generic
   application protocol framework for connection-oriented, asynchronous
   interactions. Within BEEP, features such as authentication, privacy,
   and reliability through retransmission are provided. There are two
   profiles defined in this memo: 

   o  The RAW profile is designed to provide a high-performance,
      low-impact footprint, using essentially the same format as the
      existing UDP-based syslog service.

   o  The COOKED profile is designed to provide a structured entry
      format, in which individual entries are acknowledged (either
      positively or negatively).

Internet-Draft        Reliable Delivery for Syslog          October 2000


   The choice of profile is independent of the operational roles
   discussed above. 

    For example, in 

     +--------+        +-------+        +-----------+
     | Device | -----> | Relay | -----> | Collector |
     +--------+        +-------+        +-----------+

   the device-to-relay link could be configured to use the RAW profile,
   while the relay-to-collector link could be configured to use the
   COOKED profile. (For example, the relay may be parsing the RAW
   syslog messages from the device, knowing the details of their
   formats, before passing them to a more generic collector.) Indeed,
   the same device may use different profiles, depending on the
   collector to which it is sending entries. 

   Devices and relays SHOULD discover relays and collectors via the DNS
   SRV algorithm[6]. The service used is "syslog" and the protocol used
   is "tcp".

3. The RAW Profile

3.1 RAW Profile Overview

   The RAW profile is designed for minimal implementation effort, high
   efficiency, and backwards compatibility. It is appropriate
   especially in cases where legacy syslog processing will be applied.

   When the profile is started, no piggyback data is supplied. All BEEP
   messages in the RAW profile are specified as having a MIME
   Content-Type[5] of application/octet-stream. Once the channel is
   open, the listener (not the initiator) sends a MSG message
   indicating it is ready to act as a syslog sink. (Refer to [2]'s
   Section 2.1 for a discussion of roles that a BEEP peer may perform,
   including definitions of the terms "listener," "initiator,"
   "client," and "server.") 

   The initiator uses ANS frames to supply syslog entries in the
   current UDP format, as specified in [1]'s Section 3. When the
   initiator has no more entries to send, it finishes with a NUL
   message and closes the channel. 

   An example might appear as follows: 

      L: <wait for incoming connection>
      I: <establish connection>
      L: RPY 0 0 . 0 165
      L:
      L: <greeting>
      L:   <profile

      L:   <profile uri='http://xml.resource.org/profiles/syslog/RAW' />
      L: </greeting>
      L: END
      I: RPY 0 0 . 0 16
      I:
      I: <greeting />
      I: END
      I: MSG 0 1 . 16 121

      I:
      I: <ok />
      I: END
      I: MSG 0 4 . 171 59

      I:

      L: <ok />
      L: END
      L: <closes connection>
      I: <closes connection>
      L: <awaits next connection>


   Here we see a BEEP session established, followed by the use of the
   RAW profile. The initiator is a device, while the listener is a
   collector. The initiator opens the channel, but the listener sends
   the first MSG. This allows the initiator to send any number of ANS
   frames carrying syslog event messages. The initiator sends a NUL
   frame to indicate it is finished. Upon receiving the NUL, the
   listener closes the RAW channel. The initiator has the choice of
   closing the entire BEEP session or opening a new syslog channel (RAW
   or COOKED) for more transfers. In this example, the initiator
   chooses to close the entire BEEP session.

3.2 RAW Profile Identification and Initialization

   The RAW syslog profile is identified as 
           http://xml.resource.org/profiles/syslog/RAW
    in the BEEP "profile" element during channel creation.

   No data is piggybacked during channel creation. 

3.3 RAW Profile Message Syntax

   All BEEP messages in this profile have a MIME content-type of
   application/octet-stream. The listener's first BEEP message is
   ignored and indeed may be empty except for headers; hence, any
   syntax is acceptable. The ANS messages the initiator sends in
   response MUST be formatted according to Section 3 of [1]. In
   particular, the syslog event message MUST be transmitted as ASCII
   alphanumerics and symbols, only using codes 32 through 126.  The
   syslog message message starts with a leading "<" ('less-than'
   character), followed by a number, which is followed by a ">"
   ('greater-than' character). This is optionally followed by a single
   ASCII space.  The remainder of the syslog message follows this. 
   There is no ending delimiter, but the syslog event message body
   length MUST be 1024 bytes or less, excluding BEEP framing overhead.
   Note that there MUST NOT be a CRLF between the text of the event
   message and the "END" marking the trailer of the BEEP frame. 

3.4 RAW Profile Semantics

   The listener's opening BEEP message has no semantics. (It is a good
   place to put in an identifying greeting.) The initiator's ANS
   messages MUST specify a facility, severity, and textual message, as
   described in [1].

4. The COOKED Profile

4.1 COOKED Profile Overview

   The COOKED profile is designed for new implementations of syslog
   protocol handlers. It provides a much finer grain of information,
   allowing a better degree of automation in processing. Naturally, it
   includes more overhead as well in support of this. 

   The COOKED profile supports two elements of interest: 

   o  The "iam" element identifies the sender to the receiver, allowing
      each peer to name itself for the other, and specifying the roles
      (device, relay, or collector) each is taking on.

   o  The "entry" element provides a parsed version of the syslog
      entry, with the various fields of interest broken out.

4.2 COOKED Profile Identification and Initialization

   The COOKED syslog profile is identified as 
           http://xml.resource.org/profiles/syslog/COOKED
    in the BEEP "profile" element during channel creation.

   During channel creation, the corresponding "profile" element in the
   BEEP "start" element may contain an "iam" element. If channel
   creation is successful, then before sending the corresponding reply,
   the BEEP peer processes the "iam" element and includes the resulting
   response in the reply. This response will be an "ok" element, an
   "error" element, or an "iam" element. The choice of which element is
   returned is dependant on local provisioning of the recipient.
   Including an "iam" in the initial "start" element has exactly the
   same semantics as passing it as the first MSG message on the
   channel. 

4.3 COOKED Profile Message Syntax

   All BEEP messages in this profile have a MIME Content-Type[5] of
   text/xml. The syntax of the individual elements is specified in
   Section 7. 

4.4 COOKED Profile Message Semantics

   Initiators issue two elements: "iam" and "entry", each using a
   "MSG". The listener issues "iam" and "ok" in "RPY" frames and
   "error" in an "ERR" frame. (See [2]'s Section 2.3.1 for the
   definitions of the "error" and "ok" elements.)

4.4.1 The IAM Element

   The "iam" element serves to identify a device, relay, or collector
   at one end of the BEEP channel to the device, relay, or collector at
   the other end of the channel. The "iam" element includes the type of
   peer (device, relay, or collector), the fully qualified domain name
   of the peer, and the IP address of the peer. 

   An "iam" element may be sent by the initiator of the channel at any
   time. The listener responds to an "iam" element with its own "iam",
   an "ok" (indicating acceptance and no future "iam" forthcoming), or
   an "error" (indicating rejection). The identity and role in effect
   is specified by the most recent "iam" not answered with an "error". 

   An "iam" could be rejected (with an "error" element) by the listener
   if the privacy or authentication that has been negotiated is
   inadequate, if the authenticated user does not have authorization to
   serve in the specified role, or if any of the attributes of the
   element do not match the session's properties (e.g., the IP address
   claimed in the "iam" element does not match the source address of
   the TCP connection). 

   For example, a successful creation might look like this:

      I: MSG 0 10 . 1832 247
      I: Content-type: text/xml
      I:
      I: <start number='1'>
      I:   <profile
      I:       uri='http://xml.resource.org/profiles/syslog/COOKED'>
      I:     <![CDATA[ <iam fqdn='lowry.example.com' ip='10.0.0.27'
      I:       type='device'/> ]]>
      I:   </profile>
      I: </start>
      L: END

   An creation with an embedded "iam" that fails might look like this:

      C: MSG 0 12 . 1832 247
      C: Content-type: text/xml

      S:       to "iam" for 'tuttle.example.com'</error> ]]>
      S: </profile>
      S: END

4.4.2 The ENTRY Element

   The "entry" element carries the details of a single syslog entry.
   The attributes of an "entry" element include "facility", "severity",
   "timestamp", "processName", and "processID". "Facility" and
   "severity" have the semantics defined in [1]'s 3.1. The other
   attributes have the semantics as in Section 4 of [1]. The timestamp
   is always in UTC.

   If the client is a relay, the "entry" SHOULD also contain the
   attributes "deviceFQDN" and "deviceIP", specifying the FQDN and IP
   address of the device that originally created the entry. The
   character data for the element is the unstructured syslog event
   message being logged. In this case, "processName" and "processID"
   SHOULD be those of the original device generating the entry (unless
   the device cannot supply a processName and processID). The
   "timestamp" SHOULD be that of the original entry generation time,
   rather than the time the entry was passed outward from the relay. 

   The "entry" element may also contain an "xml:lang" attribute,
   indicating the language in which the CDATA content of the tag is
   presented, a la [4].

Internet-Draft        Reliable Delivery for Syslog          October 2000


   The "entry" element is answered with either an empty "ok" element if
   everything was successful, or a standard "error" element if there
   was a problem. An "entry" element can be rejected if no "iam"
   element has been accepted by the listener. It can also be rejected
   if the user authenticated on the BEEP session (if any) does not have
   the authority to generate (as a device) or relay that entry. 

   A successful exchange of an "entry" element may look like this:

      C: MSG 1 0 . 2058 160
      C: Content-Type: text/xml
      C:
      C: <entry facility='24' severity='5' timestamp='20001027132108'
      C:   processName='imxpd' processID='141'>
      C:     No 27B/6 available</entry>
      C: END
      S: RPY 1 0 . 933 33
      S: Content-Type: text/xml
      S:
      S: <ok/>
      S: END

   Here, the device IP address and FQDN are taken from the "iam"
   element, if any, or from the TCP connection information. 

   An example where an "entry" element is reject with an "error"
   element:

      C: MSG 1 2 . 2212 236
      C: Content-Type: text/xml
      C:
      C: <entry facility='24' severity='5' timestamp='20001027132215'
      C:   deviceFQDN='jack.invisible.net' deviceIP='10.0.0.83'
      C:   processName='imxpd' processID='141'>
      C:     Replacement device found in nostril.

   Here, the client attempts to relay an entry on behalf of
   jack.example.com, but the entry is refused by the collector for
   administrative reasons. This may occur, for example, if
   lowry.example.com is in a different department than jack.example.com.

5. Additional Provisioning

   In more advanced configurations, syslog devices, relays, and
   collectors can be configured to support various delivery priorities.
   Multiple channels running the same profile can be opened between two
   peers, with higher priority syslog messages routed to a channel that
   is given more bandwidth. Such provisioning is a local matter. 

   Syslog[1] discusses a number of reasons why privacy and
   authentication of syslog entry messages may be important in a
   networked computing environment. The nature of BEEP allows for
   convenient layering of authentication and privacy over any BEEP
   channel. 

5.1 Message Authenticity

   Section 5.2 of [1] discusses the dangers of unauthenticated syslog
   entries. To prevent inauthentic syslog event messages from being
   accepted, configure syslog peers to require the use of a strong
   authentication technology for the BEEP session. 

   If provisioned for message authentication, implementations SHOULD
   use SASL mechanism DIGEST-MD5[7] to provision this service.

5.2 Message Replay

   Section 5.3.4 of [1] discusses the dangers of syslog message replay.
   To prevent syslog event messages from being replayed, configure
   syslog peers to require the use of a strong authentication
   technology for the BEEP session.  

   If provisioned to detect message replay, implementations SHOULD use
   SASL mechanism DIGEST-MD5[7] to provision this service.

5.3 Message Integrity

   Section 5.5 of [1] discusses the dangers of syslog event messages
   being maliciously altered by an attacker. To prevent messages from
   being altered, configure syslog peers to require the use of a strong
   authentication technology for the BEEP session. 

   If provisioned to protect message integrity, implementations SHOULD
   use SASL mechanism DIGEST-MD5[7] to provision this service.

5.4 Message Observation

   Section 5.6 of [1] discusses the dangers (and benefits) of syslog
   messages being visible at intermediate points along the transmission
   path between device and collector. To prevent messages from being
   viewed by an attacker, configure syslog peers to require the use of
   a transport security profile for the BEEP session. (However, other
   traffic characteristics, e.g., volume and timing of transmissions,
   remain observable.) 

   If provisioned to secure messages against unauthorized observation,
   implementations SHOULD use the TLS profile[2] to provision this
   service. The cipher algorithm used SHOULD be
   TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA.

5.5 Summary of Recommended Practices

   For the indicated protections, implementations SHOULD be configured
   to use the indicated mechanisms:


               Desired Protection
       Auth Replay Integrity Observation       SHOULD tune using
       ---- ------ --------- -----------       -----------------
        xx                                     .../sasl/DIGEST-MD5
        xx    xx                               .../sasl/DIGEST-MD5
        xx    xx      xx                       .../sasl/DIGEST-MD5
        xx    xx      xx         xx            .../TLS


   BEEP peer identities used for authentication SHOULD correspond to
   the FQDN of the initiating peer. That is, a relay running on
   relay.example.com should use a "user ID" of "relay.example.com"
   within the SASL authentication profiles, as well as in the FQDN of
   the "iam" element.

9. Security Considerations

   Consult Section 5 of [1] for a discussion of security issues for the
   syslog service. In addition, since the RAW and COOKED profiles are
   defined using the BEEP framework, consult [2]'s Section 8 for a
   discussion of BEEP-specific security issues.
