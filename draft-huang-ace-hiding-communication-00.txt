Abstract

   Due to the computation and storage limitations of constrained-node
   networks, it is costly to apply those security mechanisms based on
   public key algorithm. This document proposed a subliminal channel
   hiding communication method, which can provide message
   authentication service and protect the transmission of the sensitive
   data.

1. Introduction

   In the existing networks, the processing of the sensitive data has
   mainly used a variety of encryption technologies, and the sensitive
   data is transmitted through the public channel. The attacker could
   easily detect the communication process, hence, the man-in-middle
   attack, the DoS attack or the Sybil attack can be applied to
   interfere the communication, which makes the legal receiver cannot
   obtain the encrypted sensitive data, and leads to the failure of the
   communication process eventually.

   The subliminal channel hiding communication is to hide the sensitive
   data into the ordinary data. The attacker is hard to analyze whether
   there is any sensitive data in the ordinary data. In this way, the
   transmitted ordinary data would not cause attacker's attentions and
   doubts. The subliminal channel hiding communication decreased the

   intercept rate of the sensitive data and guaranteed the security of
   the sensitive data fundamentally.

   The traditional subliminal channel hiding communication is not
   suitable for the constrained-node networks due to its high
   computational overhead. Many existing subliminal channel
   communications are based on public key mechanisms, such as: Scheme
   of subliminal channel based on Schnorr digital signature and
   analysis, and the Subliminal Channel Protocol based on Elliptic
   Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, both of them hides the sensitive
   data into the digital signature by using embedding algorithm.
   Although the message authentication mechanism is introduced in the
   communication process, the asymmetric encryption technology is
   adopted in the existing embedding algorithm, which increases the
   calculation costs of the node, and makes the distribution of the
   public key and the private key very complex.

   The purpose of this document is to solve the problems of low
   security and high energy consumption in constrained-node networks
   communication process. A subliminal channel hiding communication
   method based on Message Authentication Code (MAC) has been put
   forward. By using the data hiding technology, the confidentiality
   and integrity of the sensitive data can be protected, where the
   sensitive data is less vulnerable to be attacked in the
   communication process.

2. Subliminal Channel Hiding Communication

2.1. Overview of the scheme

   There are two types of nodes in this document, the cluster head node
   which is a resource-rich node, and the cluster node which is a
   constrained-node. The topology of the network is shown in Figure 1.
   Node A is cluster head node, node B, C and N etc. are cluster nodes.

                       +---+
                 +---->| A |<------+
                 |     +---+       |
                 |       |         |
                 v       v         v
               +---+   +---+     +---+
               | B |   | C | ... | N |
               +---+   +---+     +---+
          Figure 1. The network topology

   There is a trust third party with high computation and storage
   capacity in the network used to distribute the key materials and
   other necessary materials to the cluster head node and the cluster
   nodes at the initialization phase. The mode of the third party is
   shown in Figure 2.

             Key/Prime number +-------------------+
               +--------------| Trust third party |
               |              +-------------------+
               |                             |
               |                             | Key/Prime number
               v                             v
    +-------------------+            +--------------+
    | Cluster head node |<---------->| Cluster node |
    +-------------------+            +--------------+
        Figure 2. The third-party mode

   The cluster head node hides the sensitive data into MAC and
   constructs a broadcast packet by using Chinese Remainder Theorem
   (CRT). Then the cluster head node sends the broadcast packet to the

   cluster nodes. While the cluster nodes receive the broadcast packet
   it SHOULD have the message authenticated before, and then it can
   extract the sensitive data from the MAC if the message is certified.
   The attacker cannot know whether the MAC contains a sensitive data
   and cannot get any data from the MAC. This method increased the
   difficulty of decoding the sensitive data.


2.2. The implementation of the scheme

   The communication process is divided into several steps: (1)
   Initialization phase; (2) Preprocessing phase; (3) Constructing
   broadcast packets; (4) Message authentication; (5) Recovering the
   sensitive data.

   (1) Initialization phase: In order to realize authentication and
   information hiding, the trust third party needs to generate the key
   parameters. The trust third party generates a key k shared by the
   whole network nodes, and a series keysrespectively shared by the
   cluster nodes and the cluster head node. The trust third party also
   generates a large prime number m shared by the whole network nodes,
   and a series of large prime numberrespectively shared by the cluster
   node and the cluster head nodes.

   (2) Preprocessing phase: when the cluster head node broadcasts the
   ordinary data v, it utilizes hash algorithm and key k to generate a
   preprocessed data b.

   If the cluster head node wants to send a sensitive data u to the
   cluster node A, it utilizes the individual key KA and the identity
   of the receiving node A through a symmetric encryption algorithm to
   generate an encrypted sensitive data U.

   (3) Constructing broadcast packets phase: the cluster head node
   utilizes the preprocessed data b, the prime number m, the encrypted
   sensitive data U and the prime number mA which is shared by the
   cluster node A and the cluster head node to calculate the congruence
   equation according to the Chinese Remainder Theorem algorithm.

   The cluster head node calculates the solution of the congruence
   equation as the MAC which is embedded the sensitive data. Then the
   cluster head node constructs a 2-tuple packets P and broadcasts to
   the cluster nodes.

   (4) Message authentication phase: when the cluster node A received
   the 2-tuple packets P, it SHOULD first authenticate the packet. If

   the packet P is certified, which means the packet p is credible;
   otherwise, it will discard the packet.

   (5) Recovering the sensitive data phase: If the packet P passed the
   verification, the cluster node A will calculate the encrypted
   sensitive data U by using its prime number mA from the MAC, then it
   uses key KA to decrypt the data U, and finally obtains the sensitive
   data u.
