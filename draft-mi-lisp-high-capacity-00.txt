1.  Introduction

   There are billions of mobile users and devices accommodated in the
   current network.  With the rapid development of Internet of Things
   (IoT) technology, the global device number accessed to the network
   will increase to hundreds of billions by 2030, and these devices will
   generate data and contents at quadrillion magnitude.

   The LISP architecture and protocols [RFC6830] introduces two new
   numbering spaces, Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators
   (RLOCs) which is intended to provide overlay network functionality.
   Therefore, the LISP mapping framework is required to have a very
   large scale and capacity to provide services for all network
   entities.

   This document introduces a high-capacity and real-time LISP mapping
   framework, which consider the scalability and incremental deployment
   to meet the challenges, and have the capability to provide efficient,
   real-time, high concurrent services when guarantee the scale.

2.  Requirements of High-capacity and Real-time LISP Mapping Framework

2.1.  Functional Requirements

   Identifiers management

   It is required to have the capacity to manage the information of all
   named entities in the network, including:

   a.  Store the information of each named entity, and each record item
       may includes registration (attribute) information and mapping
       information between indentifiers and locators.

   b.  Maintain the record information, including: add items of newly
       registered indentifiers; delete the outdated and invalid items;
       update the mapping information when locators of named entities
       changes.

   c.  Provide query service for record information.

   Mapping resolution

   It is required to provide efficient, real-time mapping service to
   support mobility and scalable routing.

2.2.  Service Requirements

   Large scale and high capacity

   It is required to have the capacity of serving all named entities in
   the network at an acceptable cost.

   Scalability and incremental deployment

   It is required to have a flexible and scalable architecture design
   which can adapt to the contraction and expansion of the ID space.

   Real-time and high concurrent

   It is required to have the capability to provide real-time, high
   concurrent services to meet the requirements of network applications.

3.  The High-capacity and Real-time LISP Mapping Architecture

   The high-capacity and real-time LISP mapping has a tiered
   architecture and each tier consists of multiple service nodes.

   a.  Tier 0: Tier 0 is the top tier in architecture, which is designed
       based on the principles of federalism and equal autonomy.  Tier 0
       consists of T0 nodes which are connected to each other in a fully
       meshed topology.  Each autonomous domain (AD) has one T0 node.
       The key function of T0 nodes is mapping resolution request
       information routing in Inter-AD and Intra-AD, no mapping
       resolution.

   b.  Tier 1: Tier 1 is the medium tier in architecture, which consists
       of T1 nodes.  T1 nodes are connected to the T0 nodes of their own

       AD, and divide the AD into resolution domains (RDs).  The key
       function of T1 nodes are maping resolution and mapping resolution
       request information routing in Inter-RD.

   c.  Tier 2: Tire 2 is at the bottom of architecture, which consists
       of T2 nodes.  T2 nodes are connected to the T1 nodes of their own
       mapping resolution domain, and furtherly divide the RD into local
       domains (LDs).  The key function of T2 nodes are mapping
       registration and resolution.  Authoritative registration and
       resolution information are stored in T2 nodes.

3.1.  Key Functions

   Service nodes of different tiers of architecture have different
   functions.

   a.  Key functions of T0 nodes.

   b.  Key functions of T1 nodes.

   c.  Key functions of T2 nodes.

3.2.  Interfaces

   The interfaces between service nodes of different tiers are
   introduced.

3.3.  Service Procedures

4.  Acknowledgements

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
