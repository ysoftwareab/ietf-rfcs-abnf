                        OAuth Response Metadata
                      draft-sakimura-oauth-meta-05

Abstract

   This specification defines an extensible metadata that may be
   inserted into the OAuth 2.0 responses to assist the clients to
   process those responses.  It is expressed either as a link header, or
   query parameters.  It will allow the client to learn where the
   members in the response could be used.  Since it is just additional
   response header/query parameters, any client that does not understand
   this extension should not break and work normally while supporting
   clients can utilize the metadata to take the advantage of the
   extension.

1.  Introduction

   Although OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] has been known for its REST
   friendliness, OAuth itself is not RESTful, as it heavily relies on
   out-of-band information to drive the interactions.  This situation
   can be eased by hypertext-enabling the endpoint responses through the
   introduction of data structure that represents such hypertext and
   other metadata.  This specification defines methods to represent such
   metadata in the authorization and token endpoints.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Authorization Response

   The Authorization response of the implementation of this
   specification MUST return the following query parameter in the
   redirect URI.

   turi  REQUIRED if the response contains code.  Token Endpoint URI.
      The value of this parameter is the URI of the Token Endpoint that
      the code can be sent to obtain the access token.

Internet-Draft                 OAuth-Meta                  November 2015


   ruri  REQUIRED if the response contains an Access Token.  Resource
      URI.  The value of this parameter is the URI of the Resource
      Endpoint that the Access Token can be used at.

   duri  OPTIONAL.  Discovery Endpoint URI.  The URI of from which the
      discovery document can be obtained.

   If the discovery document also includes Token Endpoint URI or
   Resource Endpoint, the value of the turi or ruri takes precedence.

   The following is an example of such resopnse.  Line breaks are for
   display purposes only.

   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: https://client.example.com/cb?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
       &turi=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Ftoken
       &duri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fdisco
       &state=xyz

4.  Token Endpoint Response

   Token Endpoints that implements this specification MUST return the
   following relation (rel) and the corresponding URI value as defined
   in [RFC5988] in the Access Token Response defined in [RFC6749].

   ruri  REQUIRED if the response contains a bearer Access Token.
      Resource URI.  The value of this parameter is the URI of the
      Resource Endpoint that the Access Token can be used at.

   turi  OPTIONAL.  Token Endpoint URI.  The value of this parameter is
      the URI of the Token Endpoint that the Refresh Token can be sent
      to obtain a new Access Token.

   duri  OPTIONAL.  Discovery Endpoint URI.  The URI of from which the
      discovery document can be obtained.

   Following is an example of an HTTPS response.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Link: <https://example.com/userinfo>; rel="ruri",
    <https://example.com/disco>; rel="duri"
   Content-Type: application/JSON; charset=utf-8

   {
           "access_token":"aCeSsToKen"
   }

5.  IANA Considerations

   be]] registered by mail to link-relations@ietf.org.

   o  Relation Name: turl

   o  Description: An OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint specified in section 3.2
      of [RFC6749].
