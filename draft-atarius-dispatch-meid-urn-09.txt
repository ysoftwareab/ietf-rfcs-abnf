A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the Device Identity and the Mobile
                       Equipment Identity (MEID)
                   draft-atarius-dispatch-meid-urn-09

Abstract

   This document defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for the
   Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP2) and a Namespace Specific
   String (NSS) for the Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID).  The structure
   of an MEID is 15 hexadecimal encoded digits long and is defined in
   the Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) (see [S.R0048-A])
   to uniquely identify each individual mobile equipment (e.g., a
   handset or mobile phone).  The 3GPP2 has a requirement to be able to
   use an MEID as a URN.  This document fulfills that requirement.

1.  Introduction

   A single mode 3GPP mobile equipment which uses only 3GPP technology
   to transmit and receive voice or data, or a dual mode 3GPP/3GPP2
   mobile equipment which uses either 3GPP or 3GPP2 technology to
   transmit and receive voice or data has an International Mobile
   station Equipment Identity (IMEI) to identify the mobile equipment.
   Document [RFC7254] defines a URN Namespace and an NSS for the IMEI.
   For cases where the mobile equipment uses decimal values (i.e., IMEI)
   as an identity for dual mode 3GPP/3GPP2 access the IMEI urn as
   defined in [RFC7254] can be used to identify the mobile equipment.

   However, single mode 3GPP2 mobile equipment which supports only 3GPP2
   access technology to transmit and receive voice or data has a
   hexadecimal MEID.  Since there are fundamental differences between
   MEID and IMEI, i.e. in encoding, format and the ownership, [RFC7254]
   cannot be employed to represent the hexadecimal MEID.

   This document specifies a URN namespace for 3GPP2 and an NSS for the
   hexadecimal MEID as per the namespace registration requirement in
   [RFC3406].  The Namespace Identifier (NID) '3gpp2' is for identities

   used in 3GPP2 networks.  The MEID is managed by the 3GPP2, so this
   NID is managed by the 3GPP2.  Whilst this specification currently
   specifies only the MEID NSS under the '3gpp2' NID, additional NSS
   under the '3gpp2' NID may be specified in the future by the 3GPP2.

   The hexadecimal MEID is 15 hexadecimal digits long and includes a
   manufacturer code of 8 hexadecimal digits and the serial number of 6
   hexadecimal digits plus a hexadecimal digit as a check digit.

   The manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment manufacturer.
   A manufacturer can be assigned more than one manufacturer code.  The
   serial number uniquely identifies each mobile equipment within the
   manufacturer code.  The check digit is used as assurance of integrity
   in error-prone operations, e.g. when used with certain types of
   readers during inventory management operations.  The check digit is
   not transmitted.

   The information here is meant to be a concise guide for those wishing
   to use the hexadecimal MEID as a URN.  Nothing in this document
   should be construed to override [S.R0048-A] that defines the MEID.

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

   The identifier is expressed in American Standard Code for Information
   Interchange (ASCII) characters and has a hierarchical expression
   using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) defined in [RFC5234], as
   follows:


   pp2-urn         = "urn:" pp2-NID ":" pp2-NSS
   pp2-NID         = "3gpp2"
   pp2-NSS         = meid-specifier
   meid-specifier  = "meid:" meidval


   An NSS for the MEID is defined under the '3gpp2' NID.

   An MEID is an identifier under the '3gpp2' NID that uniquely
   identifies mobile equipment used in 3GPP2 defined networks.

   The representation of the MEID is a specific number of hexadecimal
   digits, as described in [S.R0048-A].

   The formal definition of a URN with 'meid' NSS contains one meidval
   with the formal definition according to the following ABNF [RFC5234]:

   meidval           = Manufacturer-Code "-" Serial-Number
   Manufacturer-Code = 8HEX
   Serial-Number     = 6HEX
   HEX               = DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

   The 3GPP2 will take responsibility for the '3gpp2' namespace,
   including the 'meid' NSS.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

Internet-Draft               MEID Based URN                   March 2015


   Identifiers in the '3gpp2' NID are defined and assigned by the 3GPP2
   or an agency appointed by 3GPP2 after ensuring that the URNs to be
   assigned are unique.  Uniqueness is achieved by checking against the
   IANA registry of previously assigned names.

   Procedures are in place to ensure that each MEID is uniquely assigned
   by the mobile equipment manufacturer so that it is guaranteed to
   uniquely identify that particular mobile equipment.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

   The 3GPP2 is committed to maintaining uniqueness and persistence of
   all resources identified by assigned URNs.

   As the NID sought is '3gpp2', and 3GPP2 is the long standing acronym
   for the standards organization which includes the mobile phone
   operators, the URN should also persist indefinitely (at least as long
   as there is a need for its use).  The assignment process guarantees
   that names are not reassigned.  The binding between the name and its
   resource is permanent.

   The Manufacturer Code and Serial Number portions of the MEID are
   permanently stored in the mobile equipment so they remain persistent
   as long as the mobile equipment exists.  The process for Manufacturer
   Code and Serial Number assignment is documented in [SC.R4002-0] and
   the Manufacturer Code and Serial Number values once assigned are not
   re-assigned to other mobile equipments.

   Process of identifier assignment:

   The 3GPP2 or its approved agency will manage the <NSS> (including
   '3gpp2'), identifier resources to maintain uniqueness.  The process
   for MEID assignment is documented in [SC.R4002-0].

   Process for identifier resolution:

   Since the '3gpp2' NSS is not currently globally resolvable, this is
   not applicable.



   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

   Two 3GPP2 MEID URNs are equivalent if they have the same 'meidval'
   and the same parameter values in the same sequential order.  All of
   these comparisons are to be case-insensitive.

Internet-Draft               MEID Based URN                   March 2015


   Any identifier in '3gpp2' NSS can be compared using the normal
   mechanisms for percent-encoded UTF-8 strings (see [RFC3629]).

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

   The string representation of the '3gpp2' NID and of the MEID NSS is
   fully compatible with the URN syntax (see [RFC2141]).

   Validation Mechanism:

   The MEID can be validated using the mechanism defined in [S.R0048-A].

   Scope:

   3GPP2 URN is global in scope.

4.  Specification

4.1.  MEID Parameters

   Any future change to the format of the 'meid' NSS requires the use of
   the procedure for URN NSS changes (currently through the publication
   of a future Informational RFCs approved by IETF consensus).

   [draft-atarius-dispatch-meid-urn-as-instanceid] specifies how the
   MEID URN can be used as an instance ID as specified in [RFC5626].
   Any change to the instance ID, will require an update to
   [draft-atarius-dispatch-meid-urn-as-instanceid].  An example of 3GPP2
   MEID URN is:

   urn:3gpp2:meid:A04B0D56-02A7E3

4.2.  MEID Format

4.2.1.  Manufacturer Code

   The manufacturer code is an 8 hexadecimal digit value.  The
   manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment manufacturer.  The
   manufacturer code is chosen from a range of values allocated to the
   mobile equipment manufacturer in order to uniquely identify the
   mobile equipment.

4.2.2.  Serial Number

   The serial number is a 6 hexadecimal digit value.  The serial number
   identifies equipment within the manufacturer code.

Internet-Draft               MEID Based URN                   March 2015


4.2.3.  Check Digit

   This is a single hexadecimal digit (bits 1-4 of octet 8) and is used
   as assurance of integrity in error-prone operations, e.g. when used
   with certain types of readers during inventory management operations.
   The check digit is not transmitted by the mobile equipment.

4.2.4.  Hexadecimal Encoding

   The MEID format is 15 hexadecimal digits encoded in 8 octets as
   defined in [S.R0048-A].  The following figure is an abstract
   representation of a hexadecimal encoded MEID stored in memory (the
   actual storage format in memory is implementation specific).  In this
   figure, the most significant digit of the Manufacturer Code is
   encoded in the bits 1-4 of octet 1.  Bits 5-8 of octet 8 are zero-
   padded, since the bits 1-4 are only needed to encode the Check Digit.
   The most significant digit of the Serial Number is encoded in the
   bits 1-4 of octet 5.  When MEID is included in a cellular signaling
   message, the Check Digit is omitted and the first 7 Octets in the
   following figure are only transmitted, [X.S0008-0].

5.  Community considerations

   3GPP2 defined mobile equipment will be interoperating with Internet
   devices for a variety of voice and data communication services.  To
   do this, they need to make use of Internet protocols that will
   operate end to end between mobile equipments in 3GPP2 networks and
   devices in the general Internet.  Some of these protocols require the
   use of URNs as identifiers.  Within the 3GPP2 networks, mobile
   equipments are identified by their MEID.  Internet users will need to
   be able to receive and include the 3GPP2 URN in various Internet
   protocol elements to facilitate communication between pure Internet-
   based devices and 3GPP2 mobile equipments.  Thus the existence and
   syntax of these namespaces needs to be available to the general
   Internet community and the namespace needs to be reserved with IANA
   in order to guarantee uniqueness and prevent potential namespace
   conflicts both within the Internet and within 3GPP2 networks.

   Conversely, Internet implementations will not generally possess MEID
   identifiers.  The identifiers generated by such implementations will
   typically be URNs within namespaces other than '3gpp2', and may,
   depending on context, even be non-URN URIs.  Implementations are
   advised to be ready to process URIs other than '3gpp2' namespaced
   URNs, so as to aid in interoperability.

6.  Namespace considerations

   A URN was considered the most appropriate URI to represent the MEID
   as this identifier may be used and transported similarly to the
   Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) which is defined as a URN in
   [RFC4122].  Since specifications for protocols that are used to
   transport device identifiers often require the device identifier to
   be globally unique and in the URN format, it is necessary that the
   URN formats are defined to represent the MEID.

7.  IANA considerations

   In accordance with BCP 66 [RFC3406], IANA is asked to register the
   Formal URN namespace '3gpp2' in the "Uniform Resource Name (URN)
   Namespaces" registry, using the registration template presented in
   Section 3 of this document.

8.  Security considerations

   MEIDs (but with the check digit) are displayable on most 3GPP2 mobile
   equipments and in many cases are printed on the case within the
   battery compartment.  Anyone with brief physical access to the mobile
   device can therefore easily obtain the MEID.  Therefore MEIDs MUST
   NOT be used as security capabilities (identifiers whose mere
   possession grants access).  Unfortuantely there are currently
   examples of some applications which are using the MEID for
   authorization.  Also some service provider's customer service
   departments have been known to use knowledge of the MEID as "proof"
   that the caller is the legitimate owner of the mobile device.  Both
   of these are inappropriate uses of the MEID.

   Since the MEID is permanently assigned to the mobile equipment and is
   not modified when the ownership of the mobile equipment changes,
   (even upon a complete software reload of the mobile equipment), the
   MEID URN MUST NOT be used as a user identifier or user address by an
   application.  Using the MEID to identify a user or as a user address
   could result in communications destined for a previous owner of a
   device being received by the new device owner or could allow the new
   device owner to access information or services owned by the previous
   device owner.

Internet-Draft               MEID Based URN                   March 2015


   Additionally, since the MEID identifies the mobile equipment, it
   potentially could be used to identify and track users for the
   purposes of survellience and call data mining if sent in the clear.

   Since the MEID is personally identifiable information, uses of the
   MEID URN with IETF protocols require a specification and IETF expert
   review [RFC5226] in order to ensure that the privacy concerns are
   appropriately addressed.  Protocols carrying the MEID URN SHOULD at a
   minimum use strongly hop-by-hop encrypted channels and that it is
   RECOMMENDED that end-to-end encryption is used.
