Abstract 
 
   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol defines a 
   request/response protocol used for the communication between a Path 
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or 
   between two PCEs. PCEP employs Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as 
   the transport layer protocol by using a registered TCP port. 

   This document proposes the possibility of employing UDP as the 
   transport layer protocol instead of TCP. 

   UDP is a connectionless protocol within TCP/IP protocol suite that 
   corresponds to the transport layer in the ISO/OSI reference model. 
   UDP converts data messages generated by an application into packets 
   to be sent through IP. The reliability is not guaranteed by UDP and 
   should be ensured by the application that generates the data message. 

   The PCECP application is flexible to ensure the reliability of PCECP 
   messages. This document explains on how the reliability of the PCECP 
   messages can be achieved by means of PCECP, while operating PCECP 
   over UDP.

1. Introduction 

   [RFC4655] describes the motivation and architecture for a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE) based model for the computation of Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic 
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  The PCE is an entity 
   (component, application or network node) that is capable of computing 
   a network path or route based on a network graph and applying 
   computational constraints.  The Path Computation Client (PCC) is any 
   client application requesting a path computation to be performed by a 
   PCE.  [RFC5440] specifies the Path Computation Element communication 
   Protocol (PCEP) used for communication between a PCC and PCE in 
   compliance with [RFC4657].  The PCECP(PCE Communication Protocol) is 
   an application layer communication protocol employed between PCC and 
   PCE, as well between PCE and PCE (In this document, we refer to all 
   communications as PCC-PCE regardless of whether they are PCC-PCE or 
   PCE-PCE.). The purpose of PCECP is to carry TE-LSP computation 
   requests, responses and other notifications between PCC and PCE or 
   between PCE and PCE. The PCECP operates over a transport layer 
   protocol for transmitting the PCECP messages between the PCECP peers. 

   [RFC5440] has defined TCP as the transport protocol for PCECP. This 
   document explains how to operate PCECP over UDP instead of TCP, and 
   defines the necessary changes and extensions to PCEP.

   GMPLS: Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching 

   IP:  Internet Protocol.  IP governs the break up of data messages 
   into packets, the routing of the packets from sender to destination 
   network and station, and the reassembly of the packets into the 
   original data messages at the destination. 

   PCC:  Path Computation Client. Any client application requesting a 
   path computation to be performed by the Path Computation Element. 

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application, 
   or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route 
   based on a network graph and applying computational constraints. 

   PCECP: Path Computation Element Communication Protocol, which is a 
   request/response protocol used for the communication between a PCC 
   and a PCE, or between two PCEs 

   PCEP:  A kind of specific protocol defined in [RFC5440] for PCECP.  

   PCECP Peer:  An element involved in a PCECP session (For example, a 
   PCC or a PCE). 

   PCECP Session:  The PCECP session is a logical connection established 
   automatically between the PCECP peers. 

   TE LSP:  Traffic Engineering MPLS Label Switched Path. 

   TCP:  Transmission Control Protocol. TCP is a connection-oriented, 
   end-to-end reliable protocol that governs the break up of data 
   messages into packets to be sent through IP (Internet Protocol), and 
   the reassembly and verification of the complete messages from packets 
   received by IP. 

   UDP:  User Datagram Protocol. UDP is a connectionless protocol that 
   converts data messages generated by an application into packets to be 
   sent through IP. 

3. Requirements 

   In GMPLS networks, the service has to be restored within the minimum 
   restoring time to avoid service interruption in the event of fiber or 
   node failure. In such scenarios, establishing a PCECP session, 
   controlling request retransmission, message/packet overhead over the 
   bandwidth constrained in-band signaling channels becomes critical.

3.1. Motivations for Using UDP as the transport protocol for PCECP   

   The following are the motivations for using UDP as the transport 
   protocol: 

   Absence of Initial Connection Establishment:  TCP employs three-way 
   handshake mechanism before sending the PCEP messages.  Unlike TCP, 
   UDP does not establish end-to-end connection between PCECP peers. UDP 
   communication consequently does not incur connection establishment 
   and teardown overheads. 

   Absence of Connection State:  TCP maintains the connection state in 
   the transport layer of PCECP peers.  This includes the connection 
   state, receive and send buffers, congestion control parameters, and 
   sequence numbers.  This information is used to realize the reliable 
   data transfer of TCP and the congestion control that leads to high 
   memory and CPU usage. 

   UDP does not maintain any such connection state and does not track 
   the congestion parameters or the sequence numbers.  As a result, a 
   PCE can typically support more number of PCCs when the PCECP runs 
   over UDP rather than TCP. 

   Minimum Segment Overhead:  The TCP segment has 20 bytes of header 
   overhead in each segment to guarantee the reliable transfer of 
   messages.  The UDP only has 8 bytes of overhead. 

   Absence of Inherent Data Rate:  TCP has a congestion control 
   mechanism that restricts the PCECP peer when one or more links 
   between sender and receiver becomes excessively congested.  This 
   restriction can have a severe impact for path request/response when a 
   TE-LSP is rerouted.  On the other hand, using UDP the application can 
   send data that is constrained by the rate at which the application 
   generates data and the process capabilities of the source. 

   Application Flexibility for Reliability:  The built-in reliability 
   mechanism in TCP leads to additional overhead and resource usage in 
   the network.  The PCECP can realize its own reliable mechanism to 
   ensure the reliability of messages.  For example, the PCC can realize 
   appropriate retransmission strategy to guarantee the reliable 
   delivery of PCECP messages.  The PCC can decide to retransmit the 
   request to the same PCE or to a different PCE (based on the 
   availability) in case if no response is received. 

   Absence of Message Boundary:  TCP is a stream oriented protocol and a 
   read from the socket does not guarantee the complete message. To 
   receive a complete message, the state oriented message assembler is

   required. Unlike TCP, the message assembler is not required for UDP.  
   A single UDP datagram consists of complete message and the message 
   boundaries are guaranteed irrespective of link/path MTU. 

3.2. Benefits from PCECP over UDP  

   The following are the advantages of UDP: 

   o  No time is spent in establishing a TCP connection to the PCE 
      server.  Directly PCECP session establishment can be initiated 
      using UDP. 

   o  Complexity of PCECP message parser is reduced as complete PCECP 
      message is carried by one UDP datagram.  This will enhance the 
      PCECP parser performance. 

   o  PCC has the complete control about the retransmission and can 
      choose a different PCE upon retransmission failure.  Custom 
      retransmission algorithm and policy can be implemented based on 
      the network. 

   o  If the number of PCC is huge, then number of sessions to be 
      handled is also huge.  Using TCP needs more memory and more 
      processing.  Using UDP this problem can be solved. 

   By operating PCECP over UDP, the above mentioned requirements are 
   satisfied. 

4. Proposing UDP for PCECP Transport Protocol 

   UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides a minimal, best-effort, 
   message-passing transport with minimum protocol mechanism. The 
   service provided by UDP is unreliable that provides no guarantee for 
   delivery.  The simplicity of UDP reduces the overhead from using the 
   protocol and the services may be adequate in many cases. 

   When PCECP uses UDP as transport protocol, an UDP datagram must 
   contain exactly one PCECP message. So while using UDP, the 
   application has to realize its own mechanisms to guarantee the 
   reliable delivery of messages, handle duplication, and congestion of 
   messages. 

   The following sections explain on how PCECP can handle the reliable 
   delivery of PCECP messages avoiding duplication and congestion on a 
   UDP based PCECP session.

4.1. Reliability of PCECP Messages 

   The PCC or PCE originating the PCECP message is responsible for the 
   reliable delivery of PCECP messages. For example, when a PCC is 
   sending a TE-LSP path request to PCE, PCC is responsible to keep 
   track of the request.  The PCC must retransmit its PCECP message, if 
   it fails to receive the response message, either the path response or 
   error response from the PCE. [draft-ietf-pce-monitoring] 

   4.1.1. Fast Request Retransmission with Exponential or Linear Back-
      off Mechanism 

   The PCC will transmit a request message to the selected PCE.  The 
   message exchange terminates when either the PCC receives the 
   appropriate PCECP response successfully, or when the message exchange 
   has failed as per the retransmission mechanism. 

   The retransmission behaviour is controlled and described by the 
   following variables: 

      RT:  Retransmission timeout 

      IRT:  Initial retransmission time 

      MRT:  Maximum retransmission time 

      MRC:  Maximum retransmission count 

      MRD:  Maximum retransmission duration 

   RAND:  Randomization factor.  The RAND is a random number chosen 
          with a uniform distribution between -0.3 and +0.3. 

   The PCC controls the retransmission behaviour using exponential back-
   off mechanism as explained below. 

   o  With each request transmission or retransmission, the PCC sets RT. 
      The RT for the first message retransmission is based on IRT. 

      RT =(1 + RAND)*IRT 

   o  On the expiry of RT, if the PCC has not received a response to the 
      PCReq, the PCC recomputes RT and retransmits the message.  Each of 
      the computations of a new RT includes a RAND.  The RAND is 
      included to minimize synchronization of messages transmitted by 
      PCCs.  The RT for each subsequent message transmission is based on 
      the previous value of RT. 
 
 
zhang                    Expires July 2010                   [Page 7] 

draft-zhang-pce-udp-for-pcecp-00.txt                     January 2010 


   RT = (Back-off * RTprev) + (RAND * RTprev), where Back-off = 1 for 
   Linear and 2 for Exponential. 

   o  The MRT specifies a boundary value for RT (disregarding the 
      randomization added by the use of RAND).  If MRT is 0, then there 
      is no upper limit on the value of RT.  Otherwise, when RT > MRT, 
      RT is recalculated using, RT = (1 + RAND)*MRT. 

   o  The MRC specifies a boundary value on the number of times a PCC 
      may retransmit a message.  Unless MRC is zero, the message 
      exchange fails once the PCC has retransmitted the message MRC 
      times. 

   o  MRD specifies a boundary value on the length of time a PCC may 
      retransmit a message.  Unless MRD is zero, the message exchange 
      fails once MRD seconds have elapsed since the PCC first 
      transmitted the message. 

   o  When MRC and MRD are non-zero, the message exchange fails whenever 
      either of the conditions specified in the previous points is met. 
      If both MRC and MRD are zero, the PCC continues to transmit the 
      message until it receives a response, but setting both MRC and MRD 
      to zero is not recommended. 

   The same retransmission mechanism either exponential back-off or 
   linear mechanism is followed during PCE switching. 

   4.1.2. Retransmission Parameters 

   This section presents the default values used to describe the message 
   transmission behaviour. 

   Parameter     Default Value           Range 
      IRT           1 sec         0.1 sec to 8 secs 
      MRC           3                   0 to 8 
      MRT           2 secs        0.5 sec to 16 secs 
      MRD           8 secs        1.0 sec to 64 secs 
      MPC           2                   0 to 16 
 
4.2. Handling Duplication 

   UDP does not protect against any message duplication, but PCECP can 
   follow the below mentioned mechanism to gracefully handle duplication.  
   A duplicate PCECP message is identified by a repeated PCECP request-
   ID received from the same PCC. 

 
 
zhang                    Expires July 2010                   [Page 8] 

draft-zhang-pce-udp-for-pcecp-00.txt                     January 2010 


   o  When a PCE receives a duplicate request message, and if it is 
      still processing the original message (path computation is still 
      in progress or queued, and the path response is not sent), the 
      newly received request message is dropped. 

   o  When a PCE receives a duplicate request message for which the path 
      response is already sent, PCE accepts the request and process it. 
      This is because the PCE may not be able to identify that the 
      received request is duplicate unless otherwise it maintains the 
      history. 

   o  When a PCC receives a duplicate response message, it discards it 
      as it will not be able to locate the original request message that 
      was processed earlier. 

4.3. Congestion Control 

   UDP does not provide any means to handle congestion.  Moreover, when 
   UDP is used as the transport layer protocol, the rate at which the 
   message is generated and transmitted is based on the application 
   capabilities.  This may lead to congestion at PCE when multiple PCCs 
   are sending large number of requests.  In such case, the PCE MAY drop 
   the additional requests that are governed by the load attributes such 
   as memory, CPU, etc.  The PCE MAY not send any notification to the 
   PCC that the request message is dropped.  When the request is dropped, 
   PCC will retransmit the PCECP message based on its retransmission 
   strategies. 

   However, based on a hysteresis, PCE can notify the corresponding PCC 
   before dropping the received response message during overload. At 
   once PCE is recovered from the high load condition it can continue to 
   provide the path computation service. 

   In the event of congestion in the network, UDP datagrams (carrying 
   PCECP messages) can be dropped and PCC or PCE may be unaware of this. 
   Handling of such messages is not required and is out of scope from 
   this document.  However, this results in PCC retransmitting the 
   corresponding request message. 

4.4. PCECP Messages and Object Formats 

   No new messages and objects are introduced in this document. The 
   PCECP messages and objects are the same as defined in [RFC5440].

5. UDP Port 

   The PCECP operates over UDP using a registered UDP port (4189). All 
   PCECP messages MUST be sent using the registered UDP port. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The PCECP messages could be the target of the following security 
   issues: 

   o  Spoofing (PCC or PCE impersonation) 

   o  Snooping (message interception) 

   o  Falsification 

   o  Denial of Service 

   When UDP is used, the application MUST address these security issues. 
   This can be achieved using authenticated message exchange along with 
   an appropriate replay detection scheme. At once authentication is 
   enabled; PCECP peers can verify the integrity of message before 
   processing it.  PCECP peer drops the received message in the event of 
   authentication failure. 

6.1. Authentication of PCECP Messages 

   The authentication of PCECP messages plays a vital role in resolving 
   the falsification of messages, integrality, and denial of service 
   attacks. PCECP peers can be preconfigured with authentication keys to 
   be used during the message exchange. The authentication keys can be 
   configured manually or by employing an appropriate key-exchange 
   protocol which is out of scope from this document. 

   The authentication of PCECP message can be achieved by carrying the 
   authentication information in the Authentication object to reliably 
   identify the source of a PCECP message and to confirm that the 
   contents of the PCECP message have not been tampered with. 

   The Authentication object carries authentication information to 
   authenticate the identity and contents of PCECP messages. The format 
   of the Authentication object is as follows:

   The following are the TLVs: 

     TLV type       Length                  Name 
        1             64 bits      RDM Monotonic Counter TLV 
        2            128 bits          HMAC-MD5 TLV 
 
   6.1.1. RDM Monotonic Counter TLV (64-bits) 

   The RDM Monotonic Counter TLV specifies the type of replay detection 
   to be used.  The replay detection field MUST be set to the value of a 
   monotonically increasing counter. Using a counter value, such as the 
   current time of day (for example, an NTP-format timestamp), can 
   reduce the danger of replay attacks. Hence, the replay detection 
   scheme can detect the replayed message and can drop the message even 
   when the intruder has captured the valid message (say path request 
   message) and is playing it back. If Replay is not detected, this may 
   lead to denial of service where PCE will be overloaded (PCE will 
   perform repeated path computation for the path request it has 
   received from the intruder as PCE is assuming that the valid PCC has 
   submitted the path request) 

   6.1.2. HMAC-MD5 TLV 

   The use of a particular technique based on the HMAC protocol [RFC2104] 
   using the MD5 hash [RFC1321] is defined here, however, mechanism like 
   SHA can also be used. The format of the HMAC-MD5 TLV is as follows:

   PCECP realm: The PCECP realm identifies the administrative domain 
   under which PCC and PCE are deployed. 

   key ID: The key identifier that identifies the key used to generate 
   the HMAC-MD5 value. 

   HMAC-MD5: The message authentication code generated by applying MD5 
   to the PCECP message using the key identified by the PCECP realm, PCC 
   IP address, and key ID. 

   The sender computes the MAC using the HMAC generation algorithm and 
   the MD5 hash function. The entire PCECP message (setting the MAC 
   field of the authentication option to zero), including the PCECP 
   message header and the options field, is used as input to the HMAC-
   MD5 computation function. 

   6.1.3. Message Validation 

   To validate an incoming message, the receiver computes the MAC. The 
   entire PCECP message (setting the MAC field of the authentication 
   option to 0) is used as input to the HMAC-MD5 computation function. 
   If the MAC computed by the receiver does not match the MAC contained 
   in the authentication option, the receiver MUST discard the PCECP 
   message.

   6.1.4. Key Utilization 

   Each PCC and PCE is assigned with a set of key. Each key is uniquely 
   identified by the IP address of the peer. 

   The PCC and PCE use the assigned keys to authenticate PCECP messages 
   during a session. 

7. Conclusion 

   UDP can be used as the transport layer protocol for PCECP instead of 
   TCP. The application will become responsible for the reliable 
   delivery of the messages and also monitors the congestion. The PCECP 
   session holds good even when UDP being the transport layer protocol. 

8. IANA Considerations 

8.1. UDP Port 

   PCECP will use a registered UDP port to be assigned by IANA (4189). 

8.2. PCECP Objects 

   The PCECP Objects registry contains a sub registry, PCECP Objects. 

   IANA is requested to make some allocations for the Authentication 
   object.

8.3. PCECP TLV Type Indicators

   appear in the Authentication object.
