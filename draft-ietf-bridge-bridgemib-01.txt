   Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on
   the IEEE 802.1D-1998 MAC Bridges and IEEE 802.1Q-1998 Virtual LAN
   (VLAN) standards for bridging between Local Area Network (LAN)

   segments.  Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging.
   Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to bridges
   connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.  This memo also
   includes several MIB modules in a manner that is compliant to the
   SNMPv2 SMI [18].


   1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Network Management Framework consists of several major
   components.  They are:

   o    RFC 1902 [18] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
        This supercedes an earlier definition of SMI in RFC 1155 [3].

   o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [5] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
        objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   o    RFC 1157 [4] and RFC 1905 [17] which define two versions of
        protocols providing network access to managed objects.

   Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903 [19] and conformance
   statements are defined in RFC 1904 [20].

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

   This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI
   [18].


   1.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

   2.  Overview

   A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This device
   is used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network
   layer.  These devices are often known as 'layer 2 switches'.

   There are two major modes defined for this bridging; transparent and
   source route.  The transparent method of bridging is defined by IEEE
   802.1D-1998 [11].  Managed objects for source route bridges are
   defined in [15].

   IEEE 802.1D is augmented by IEEE 802.1Q-1998 [12] to provide support
   for 'virtual bridged LANs' where a single bridged physical LAN
   network may be used to support multiple logical bridged LANs, each of
   which offers a service approximately the same as that defined by
   802.1D.  Such virtual LANs (VLANs) are an integral feature of
   switched LAN networks.  A VLAN can be viewed as a group of end-
   stations on multiple LAN segments and can communicate as if they were
   on a single LAN.  IEEE 802.1Q defines port-based Virtual LANs where
   membership is determined by the bridge port on which data frames are
   received.  This memo defines the objects needed for the management of
   port-based VLANs in bridge entities.

   This memo defines those objects needed for the management of a
   bridging entity operating in the transparent mode, as well as some
   objects applicable to all types of bridges.  Managed objects for
   Source-Routing are defined in [15].


   2.1.  Scope

   This MIB includes a comprehensive set of managed objects which
   attempts to match the set defined in IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q.
   However, to be consistent with the spirit of the SNMP Framework, a
   subjective judgement was made to omit the objects from those
   standards most 'costly' to implement in an agent and least
   'essential' for fault and configuration management.  The omissions
   are described in section 3 below.

   Historical note:

   RFC 1493 used the following principles for determining inclusion of
   an object in the BRIDGE-MIB module:







   Bell, et al.            Expires February 1999                [Page 3]


   Internet Draft          Bridge MIB Extensions             August 1998


   (1)  Start with a small set of essential objects and add only as
        further objects are needed.

   (2)  Require objects be essential for either fault or configuration
        management.

   (3)  Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.

   (4)  Limit the total of objects.

   (5)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in this
        or other MIBs.

   (6)  Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily instrumented.  The
        guideline that was followed is one counter per critical section
        per layer.




   3.  Structure of MIBs

   This document defines additional objects, on top of those existing in
   the base BRIDGE-MIB module defined in RFC1493: that MIB module is
   maintained unchanged for backwards compatibility.  Section 3.4.3 of
   the present document contains some recommendations regarding usage of
   objects in RFC1493 by devices implementing the enhancements defined
   here.

   Two MIB modules are defined here:


   (1)  Managed objects for an extended bridge MIB module P-BRIDGE-MIB
        for the traffic class and multicast filtering enhancements
        defined by IEEE 802.1D-1998.


   (2)  Managed objects for a virtual bridge MIB module Q-BRIDGE-MIB for
        the Virtual LAN bridging enhancements defined by IEEE 802.1Q-
        1998.

   Internet Draft          Bridge MIB Extensions             August 1998


   3.1.  Structure of Extended Bridge MIB module

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is
   organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and
   assignment of objects to their groups is shown below.


   3.1.1.  Relationship to IEEE 802.1D-1998 Manageable Objects

   This section contains a cross-reference to the objects defined in
   IEEE 802.1D-1998 [11].  It also details those objects that are not
   considered necessary in this MIB module.

   Some objects defined by [11] have been included in the virtual bridge
   MIB module rather than this one: entries in dot1qTpGroupTable,
   dot1qForwardAllTable and dot1qForwardUnregisteredTable are required
   for virtual bridged LANs with additional indexing (e.g. per-VLAN,
   per-FDB) and so are not defined here.  Instead, devices which do not
   implement virtual bridged LANs, should implement these tables with a
   fixed value for dot1qFdbId (the value 1 is recommended) or
   dot1qVlanIndex (the value 1 is recommended).  Devices which support
   Extended Filtering Services (dynamic learning of Multicast Group
   Addresses and Group Service Requirements in the Filtering Database)
   should support dot1qTpGroupTable, dot1qForwardAllTable and
   dot1qForwardUnregisteredTable.

   The following IEEE 802.1D management objects have not been included
   in the Bridge MIB for the indicated reasons.

     Bridge.StateValue                 not considered useful
     Bridge.ApplicantAdministrativeControl
                                       not provided per-attribute
                                       (e.g. per-VLAN, per-Group).

per-{device,port,application}
                                       control is provided in this MIB.


   3.1.2.  The dot1dExtBase Group

   This group contains the objects which are applicable to all bridges
   implementing the traffic class and multicast filtering features of
   802.1D.  It includes per-device configuration of GARP and GMRP
   protocols.  This group will be implemented by all devices which
   implement the extensions defined in 802.1D-1998.


   3.1.3.  The dot1dPriority Group

   This group contains the objects for configuring and reporting status
   of priority-based queuing mechanisms in a bridge.  This includes per-
   port user_priority treatment, mapping of user_priority in frames into
   internal traffic classes and outbound user_priority and
   access_priority.

   3.1.4.  The dot1dGarp Group

   This group contains the objects for configuring and reporting on
   operation of the Generic Attribute Registration Protocol (GARP).


   3.1.5.  The dot1dGmrp Group

   This group contains the objects for configuring and reporting on
   operation of the GARP Multicast Registration Protocol (GMRP).


   3.1.6.  The dot1dHCPort Group

   This group contains the objects for reporting port bridging
   statistics for high-capacity network interfaces.




   3.2.  Structure of Virtual Bridge MIB module

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is
   organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and
   assignment of objects to their groups is shown below.  Some of the
   original objects from RFC1493 need to be indexed differently when
   extended in a VLAN environment so some objects in that module
   effectively duplicate new objects defined here: this is necessary for
   backwards compatibility.


   3.2.1.  Relationship to IEEE 802.1Q Manageable Objects

   This section contains a cross-reference to the objects defined in
   [12].  It also details those objects that are not considered
   necessary in this MIB module.

   Note: unlike IEEE 802.1D, [12] chose not to define a new set of
   managed object names so those following are referenced from the
   descriptions of management operations with section numbering from
   clause 12 in that document.

   3.2.2.  The dot1qBase Group

   This mandatory group contains the objects which are applicable to all
   bridges implementing 802.1Q virtual LANs.


   3.2.3.  The dot1qTp Group

   This group contains objects that control the operation and report the
   status of transparent bridging.  This includes management of the
   dynamic Filtering Databases for both unicast and multicast
   forwarding.  This group will be implemented by all bridges that
   perform destination-address filtering.


   3.2.4.  The dot1qStatic Group

   This group contains objects that control static configuration
   information for transparent bridging.  This includes management of
   the static entries in the Filtering Databases for both unicast and
   multicast forwarding.

   3.2.5.  The dot1qVlan Group

   This group contains objects that control configuration and report
   status of the Virtual LANs known to a bridge.  This includes
   management of the statically configured VLANs as well as reporting
   VLANs discovered by other means e.g. GVRP.  It also controls
   configuration and reports status of per-port objects relating to
   VLANs and reports traffic statistics.  It also provides for
   management of the VLAN Learning Constraints.




   3.3.  Textual Conventions

   The datatypes MacAddress, BridgeId, Timeout, EnabledStatus, PortList,
   VlanIndex and VlanId are used as textual conventions in this
   document.  These textual conventions have NO effect on either the
   syntax nor the semantics of any managed object.  Objects defined
   using these conventions are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define their primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the
   SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers.




   3.4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   As described above, some IEEE 802.1D management objects have not been
   included in this MIB because they overlap with objects in other MIBs
   applicable to a bridge implementing this MIB.  In particular, it is
   assumed that a bridge implementing this MIB will also implement (at
   least) the 'system' group defined in MIB-II [6], the 'interfaces'
   group defined [14] and the old Bridge MIB [13].


   3.4.1.  Relationship to the 'system' group

   In MIB-II, the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory for all
   systems such that each managed entity contains one instance of each
   object in the 'system' group.  Thus, those objects apply to the
   entity as a whole irrespective of whether the entity's sole
   functionality is bridging, or whether bridging is only a subset of
   the entity's functionality.

   Internet Draft          Bridge MIB Extensions             August 1998


   3.4.2.  Relation to Interfaces MIB

   RFC 1573, the Interface MIB Evolution [14], requires that any MIB
   which is an adjunct of the Interface MIB, clarify specific areas
   within the Interface MIB.  These areas were intentionally left vague
   in [14] to avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding
   management of certain media-types.

   Section 3.3 of [14] enumerates several areas which a media-specific
   MIB must clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed in a following
   subsection.  The implementor is referred to [14] in order to
   understand the general intent of these areas.

   In [14], the 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory for all
   systems and contains information on an entity's interfaces, where
   each interface is thought of as being attached to a `subnetwork'.
   (Note that this term is not to be confused with `subnet' which refers
   to an addressing partitioning scheme used in the Internet suite of
   protocols.)  The term 'segment' is used in this memo to refer to such
   a subnetwork, whether it be an Ethernet segment, a 'ring', a WAN
   link, or even an X.25 virtual circuit.

   Implicit in this Bridge MIB is the notion of ports on a bridge.  Each
   of these ports is associated with one interface of the 'interfaces'
   group (one row in ifTable) and, in most situations, each port is
   associated with a different interface.  However, there are situations
   in which multiple ports are associated with the same interface.  An
   example of such a situation would be several ports each corresponding
   one-to-one with several X.25 virtual circuits but all on the same
   interface.

   Each port is uniquely identified by a port number.  A port number has
   no mandatory relationship to an interface number, but in the simple
   case a port number will have the same value as the corresponding
   interface's interface number.  Port numbers are in the range
   (1..dot1dBaseNumPorts).

   Some entities perform other functionality as well as bridging through
   the sending and receiving of data on their interfaces.  In such
   situations, only a subset of the data sent/received on an interface
   is within the domain of the entity's bridging functionality.  This
   subset is considered to be delineated according to a set of
   protocols, with some protocols being bridged, and other protocols not
   being bridged.  For example, in an entity which exclusively performed
   bridging, all protocols would be considered as being bridged, whereas





   Bell, et al.            Expires February 1999               [Page 13]


   Internet Draft          Bridge MIB Extensions             August 1998


   in an entity which performed IP routing on IP datagrams and only
   bridged other protocols, only the non-IP data would be considered as
   being bridged.  Thus, this Bridge MIB (and in particular, its
   counters) is applicable only to that subset of the data on an
   entity's interfaces which is sent/received for a protocol being
   bridged.  All such data is sent/received via the ports of the bridge.

   3.4.2.1.  Layering Model

   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be in
   accordance with [14] which states that the interfaces table (ifTable)
   contains information on the managed resource's interfaces and that
   each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface is
   considered an interface.

   This memo recommends that, within an entity, VLANs which are
   instantiated as an entry in dot1qVlanCurrentTable by either
   management configuration through dot1qVlanStaticTable or by dynamic
   means (e.g. through GVRP), are NOT also represented by an entry in
   ifTable.

   Where an entity contains higher-layer protocol entities e.g. IP-layer
   interfaces, that transmit and receive traffic to/from a VLAN, these
   should be represented in the ifTable as interfaces of type
   propVirtual(53).


   3.4.2.2.  ifStackTable

   In addition, [14] defines a table 'ifStackTable' for describing the
   relationship between logical interfaces within an entity.  It is
   anticipated that implementors will use this table to describe the
   binding of e.g. IP interfaces to physical ports, although the
   presence of VLANs makes the representation less than perfect for
   showing connectivity: the ifStackTable cannot represent the full
   capability of the 802.1Q VLAN bridging standard since that makes a
   distinction between VLAN bindings on 'ingress' to and 'egress' from a
   port: these relationships may or may not be symmetrical whereas [14]
   assumes a symmetrical binding for transmit and receive.  This makes
   it necessary to define other manageable objects for configuring which
   ports are members of which VLANs.

   Internet Draft          Bridge MIB Extensions             August 1998


   3.4.2.3.  ifRcvAddressTable

   This table contains all MAC addresses, unicast, multicast, and
   broadcast, for which an interface will receive packets and forward
   them up to a higher layer entity for local consumption.  Note that
   this does not include addresses for data-link layer control protocols
   such as Spanning-Tree, GMRP or GVRP.  The format of the address,
   contained in ifRcvAddressAddress, is the same as for ifPhysAddress.

   This table does not include unicast or multicast addresses which are
   accepted for possible forwarding out some other port.  This table is
   explicitly not intended to provide a bridge address filtering
   mechanism.


   3.4.3.  Relation to Basic Bridge MIB

   This section defines how objects in the basic bridge MIB module
   should be represented for devices which implement the extensions:
   some of the old objects are less useful in such devices but must
   still be implemented for reasons of backwards comaptibility.  Note
   that formal conformance statements for that MIB module do not exist
   since it is defined in SMIv1.


   3.4.3.1.  The dot1dBase Group

   This mandatory group contains the objects which are applicable to all
   types of bridges.  Interpretation of this group is unchanged.


   3.4.3.2.  The dot1dStp Group

   This group contains the objects that denote the bridge's state with
   respect to the Spanning Tree Protocol.  Interpretation of this group
   is unchanged.


   3.4.3.3.  The dot1dTp Group

   This group contains objects that describe the entity's state with
   respect to transparent bridging.

   In a device operating with a single Filtering Database,
   interpretation of this group is unchanged.

   Internet Draft          Bridge MIB Extensions             August 1998


   In a device supporting multiple Filtering Databases, this group is
   interpreted as follows:

      dot1dTpLearnedEntryDiscards
         The number of times that *any* of the FDBs became full.

      dot1dTpAgingTime
         This applies to all Filtering Databases.

      dot1dTpFdbTable
         Report MAC addresses learned on each port, regardless of which
         Filtering Database they have been learnt in.  If an address has
         been learnt in multiple databases on a single port, report it
         only once.  If an address has been learnt in multiple databases
         on more than one port, report the entry on any one of the valid
         ports.

      dot1dTpPortTable
         This table is port-based and is not affected by multiple
         Filtering Databases or multiple VLANs.  The counters should
         include frames received or transmitted for all VLANs.  Note
         that equivalent 64-bit port statistics counters are defined in
         this document for high-capacity network interfaces with
         conformance statements to indicate for which speeds of
         interface they are required.


   3.4.3.4.  The dot1dStatic Group

   This optional group contains objects that describe the configuration
   of destination-address filtering.

   In a device operating with a single Filtering Database,
   interpretation of this group is unchanged.

   In a device supporting multiple Filtering Databases, this group is
   interpreted as follows:

      dot1dStaticTable
         Entries read from this table include all static entries from
         all of the Filtering Databases.  Entries for the same MAC
         address and receive port in more than one Filtering Database
         must appear only once since these are the indices of this
         table.  This table should be implemented as read-only in
         devices that support multiple Forwarding Databases - instead,

         write access should be provided through dot1qStaticUnicastTable
         and dot1qStaticMulticastTable, as defined in this document.





   4.  Extensions to RFC 1493

   In addition to the objects in RFC1493, this document contains:

   (1)  References point to sections of IEEE 802.1D-1998.

   (2)  Added support for multiple traffic classes and dynamic multicast
        filtering as per IEEE 802.1D-1998.

   (3)  Added support for bridged Virtual LANs as per IEEE 802.1Q-1998.

   (4)  Added support for 64-bit versions of existing RFC1493 port
        counters.

   5.2.  To Do List


   (1)  Update boilerplate for appropriate new SNMP framework(s) (v3?)

   5.3.  Open Issues

   The following is a list of issues that were discussed at the Interim
   meeting in Cambridge, MA in June 1998.  Suggested resolutions agreed
   at that meeting are supplied here and the changes have been made to
   the MIB text - they are listed here for comment:


   (11) 802.1D has separate registrar and applicant controls per state
        machine (GVRP and GMRP): do we need per-VLAN and per-Group
        Registrar controls?  Agreement from interim meeting was: YES.
        This affects
        dot1qVlanStaticEgressPorts/dot1qVlanForbiddenEgressPorts and
        dot1dStaticAllowedToGoTo - added clarification to DESCRIPTION
        clauses for the first two (but we cannot add to RFC1493).  Do we
        need per-VLAN and per-Group Applicant controls?  Agreement from
        interim meeting was: NEITHER - per-port is sufficient on
        dot1qPortGvrpStatus and dot1pPortGmrpStatus.

   (12) Should the per-port GARP admin controls apply to Registrar as
        well as Applicant (dot1qPortGvrpStatus, dot1pPortGmrpStatus)?
        Alternative would be to provide separate controls for Applicant
        and Registrar.  Agreement from interim meeting was: YES - No
        change.

   (29) dot1dTrafficClassesResetToDefaults - says that it resets stats
        too.  What about userPriorityRegenTable? (AR): NUKE
        dot1dTrafficClassesResetToDefaults

   (30) Trunk ports - should MIB support such a concept (802.1Q does
        not)? NO

   (31) dot1qVlanBridgeUpTime: is this needed per-VLAN?  ifLastChange
        can do this function if we have ifTable entries per-VLAN: NO

   (32) Timestamp-based indexing for some tables?  dot1dTpFdbTable in
        RFC1493 - NO dot1qTpFdbTable - NO, TimeFilter not practical;
        lastChange not useful dot1qVlanCurrentTable - YES- added both
        dot1qVlanTimeMark and dot1qVlanNumDeletes.  dot1qStaticTable? NO
        - cannot use TimeFilter on read-create tables
        dot1qLearningConstraintsTable? NO, add
        dot1qLearningConstraintsLastChange.  dot1qPortVlanTable? NO -
        these are mostly management settable objects

   Internet Draft          Bridge MIB Extensions             August 1998


   (33) DEFVAL and MIN-ACCESS for dot1qForwardAllStaticPorts and
        dot1qForwardUnregisteredStaticPorts? updated descriptions and
        added MIN-ACCESS clauses of not-accessible for these objects.

   (34) Should an agent instantiate a set of dot1qForwardAllTable and
        dot1qForwardUnregisteredTable entries for each FDB that it could
        have or just a set for each FDB that is currently in use? The
        latter - add clarification.

   (35) Nuke dot1qStaticReceivePort? There are not any implementations
        of the RFC1493 equivalent are there? Yes there are - keep it.

   (36) Should agent accept SETs to dot1qVlanStaticUntagged,
        dot1qVlanStaticEgressPorts, dot1qVlanForbiddenEgressPorts that
        it cannot actually implement? (ELB) NO - clarify description.

   (37) Nuke dot1dPortGmrp/GvrpOperStatus? - YES.

   (38) Nuke dot1qResetToDefaults? (KZM) - YES

   (39) Nuke dot1dGarpReset? (KZM) YES, and update DESCRIPTIONs of
        dot1dGmrpStatus, dot1qGvrpStatus, dot1dPortGmrpStatus,
        dot1qPortGvrpStatus,

   (40) Make dot1dPortGarp timers per-device, not per-port? (KZM) saves
        NVRAM - assume leave it the same for now

   (41) MIN-ACCESS read-only for dot1dTrafficClass,
        dot1dRegenUserPriority (KZM) - do it

   (42) dot1qTpGroupGmrp/Igmp (KZM) - merge these to dot1qTpGroupLearnt

   (43) do we need 64-bit dot1qHC errors? (KZM) - Assume yes for now

   (45) do we need dot1qVersion? (KZM) - assume Yes

   (46) nuke dot1qTpFdbClear? dot1qFdbClear? (KZM) - assume Yes (802.1Q
        "reset bridge" operation is not now supported).

   (47) do we need dot1qFdbTable which now contains only dot1qFdbId?  -
        assume YES for now (it also now has dot1qFdbDynamicCount).

   (48) should dot1qTpFdbTable be {FID,MAC} or {MAC,FID} - assume the
        former for now

   (53) Should mention that VLAN entries in ifTable should have
        ifPhysAddress zero-length/filled (KK).  No longer relevant since
        we do not include such ifTable entries.

   (54) dot1qVlanAdminUntaggedPorts - expand DESCRIPTION to include
        meaning of 0 (KK).  Changed description to talk about
        include/exclude from the set of ports: refer to Portlist TC for
        0/1 meaning.

   Issues that are believed still to be open at close of June 1998
   interim meeting and have not been addressed in this draft.  This also
   includes new issues that have arisen due to changes agreed at that
   meeting:

   (5)  ifStackTable usage - how to represent binding of IP interfaces
        to VLANs now that we do not necessarily have one ifEntry per
        VLAN.

   (44) Clarification of dot1qHC counter descriptions - what does
        inbound mean? What counts as errors? 2 separable issues:  1. It
        was requested that the meaning of dot1qDiscardInbound be
        clarified to ensure it is distinct from other counters.
        (Specifically, why is it different from 1493?) (KZM) - this can
        be derived from other counters - NUKE IT!  2. Why are all of
        these so different from RFC1493? e.g. do they refer to
        Transparent-only? What about SRT or SR?

   (49) Now that dot1qVlanStaticTable is indexed by VlanIndex/VlanId we
        need a "next free" variable since these values must be managed
        by agent.

   (50) dot1qVlanFdbId, dot1qMaxSupportedVlans, dot1qNumVlans should not
        be range-limited.  If they are then we need new objects to
        represent the number of non-802.1Q "VLANs" too. (AHS)

   (51) dot1qConfigurablePvidTagging: does this also cover the "I can
        only set a single VLAN to be untagged on egress" implementation
        option in 802.1Q?

   (52) Do we need an explicit "dot1dExtendedFilteringServicesStatus"
        enable/disable object? (AHS)

   (55) Need to split dot1qStaticAllowedToGoTo into two portmaps in
        order to represent the 3 possible states from 802.1Q 8.11.2:
        static, forbidden and allowed to be influenced by dynamic info.

   Internet Draft          Bridge MIB Extensions             August 1998


        Same issue for unicast table. (ELB) DONE for multicast - split
        dot1qStaticAllowedToGoTo into
        dot1qStaticMulticastStaticEgressPorts and
        dot1qStaticMulticastForbiddenEgressPorts.  Issue still open for
        unicast.

   (56) Should a value of 0 be allowed for dot1qTpFdbPort? This is
        inherited from RFC1493 (ELB)

   (57) Rename dot1qVlanStaticUntagged as dot1qVlanStaticUntaggedPorts
        for consistency. (ELB)

   (58) If an empty string is used for dot1qVlanStaticName, does it have
        to be unique?  The description implies it must be unique. (ELB)
        NO - clarified this.

   (59) Should dot1qPvid have syntax VlanIndex (currently it is VlanId)?
        (ELB)

   (60) Do dot1qPortAcceptableFrameTypes and dot1qPortIngressFiltering
        also apply to tagged GMRP packets? (ELB)

   (61) Do we need dot1qLearningContraintsLastChange? It just reminds
        the manager of changes that he or some other manager made. (ELB)

   5.4.  Issues closed in this draft

   (2)  Indexing of tables by VlanId or by ifIndex? use VlanId with
        special semantics for values >=4096.  This raises new issue 49.

   (3)  Indexing of FDB tables by MacAddress or by something else? Use
        MacAddress.

   (8)  Learned entry discards counter per-VLAN or per-device? Per-
        device, already in RFC1493.

   (9)  Do we need per-FID static/dynamic filtering entry counts?
        (12.7.1.1.3) YES - count for dynamic only added as
        dot1qFdbDynamicCount.

   (20) Do we need "read filtering database (12.7.1.1): filtering
        database size"? NO

   (21) Do we need "read permanent database (12.7.6.1): permanent
        database size"? NO (this issue was wrongly recorded last time)

   (22) Do we need a 'next free ifIndex' object? NO - see issue 2.  But
        see new issue 49.

   (23) Do we need default learning constraints? YES - mandatory if
        device is Hybrid-VLAN-Learning-capable (can do both IVL and
        SVL).

   (24) Can we remove separate GARP controls? YES.

   (25) Do we need to split dot1qStaticTable into
        dot1qStaticUnicastTable and dot1qStaticMulticastTable? YES:
        dot1qStaticTable -> dot1qStaticUnicastTable, indexed by FID +
        dot1qStaticMulticastTable, indexed by VID.  Also index
        dot1qTpGroupTable by VID.  This matches the indexing assumed by
        802.1Q.

   (26) Should we have the different Service Requirements  (AllGroups,
        AllUnregisteredGroups) in dot1qServiceReqTable or should we
        leave with dot1qServiceRequirement as a 2nd index?  Split into 2
        tables, each indexed by VID.

   (27) Do we want "capabilities" bitmap objects? YES - per-port
        dot1dPortCapabilities and dot1dDeviceCapabilities.

   (28) Should ifRcvAddressTable contain entries for e.g. spanning-tree,
        GMRP, GVRP addresses? NO - clarify in preface.


   5.5.  Issues closed in previous drafts


   (1)  Should this MIB offer support for SMIv1-only agents
        (Counter32/64)? ADDED Counter32/Counter64 versions of the per-
        VLAN statistics.  ADDED Counter64 versions of the per-port
        statistics from RFC1493.  Added appropriate conformance clauses
        for all.

   (4)  Include RFC1493 by value or reference? REFERENCE

   (6)  Representations of filtering entry for "AllGroups" and
        "AllUnregisteredGroups" DONE

   (7)  Should we represent all available FIDs up front or use a "next
        free" object for the manager to create them as needed?  NEITHER
        - see issue 25 above.

   Internet Draft          Bridge MIB Extensions             August 1998


   (10) Separate config and status info for e.g. dot1dPortGmrpTable,
        dot1qPortVlanTable?  NO CHANGE

   (13) Learning constraints table seems clumsy - can we improve this?
        DONE

   (14) Do we need to define a "notify vlan registration failure" trap?
        NO

   (15) dot1qFdbAgingTime is currently per-FID: 802.1Q has it per-
        device. PER DEVICE

   (16) dot1pPortDefaultUserPriority - can this usefully be per-port,
        per-VLAN? PER-PORT

   (17) Both dot1qVlanCurrentTable and dot1qVlanStaticTable are indexed
        by dot1qVlanIfIndex but that only appears in
        dot1qVlanStaticTable - is this a problem? MOVED TO
        dot1qVlanCurrentTable.

   (18) Should we choose same names (up/down) as IF-MIB for values of
        the admin/oper status values, rather than defining our own new
        TC?  Is there an existing TC we can import? NO CHANGE.

   (19) Should we have write-only "reset" objects or should these be
        read-write to help MIB browsers (assume write-only)? READ-WRITE.

           the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
           represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port

   8.  Acknowledgments

   This document expands upon previous work which resulted in RFC1493.

   Much of the groundwork for this document was performed by the IEEE
   802.1 working group during the definition of the IEEE 802.1D updates
   [12] and IEEE 802.1Q [13].  Some ideas were also taken from an
   earlier Internet Draft for a VLAN MIB [16] from I. Jeyasubramanian.

   The authors wish to thank the members of the Bridge Working Group for
   their many comments and suggestions which improved this effort.

   10.  Security Considerations

   Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered
   sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
   received SNMP requests and controlled access to management
   information should be employed in such environments.  The method for
   this authentication is a function of the SNMP Administrative
   Framework, and has not been expanded by this MIB.

   Several objects in this MIB allow write access.  Setting these
   objects can have a serious effect on the operation of the network,
   including enabling or disabling forwarding of data.  It is
   recommended that implementers seriously consider whether set
   operations should be allowed without providing, at a minimum,
   authentication of request origin.
