 Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Request Routing: CDNI
          Footprint and Capabilities Advertisement using ALTO
              draft-ietf-alto-cdni-request-routing-alto-10

Abstract

   The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) framework
   [RFC6707] defines a set of protocols to interconnect CDNs, to achieve
   multiple goals such as extending the reach of a given CDN to areas
   that are not covered by that particular CDN.  One component that is
   needed to achieve the goal of CDNI described in [RFC7336] is the CDNI
   Request Routing Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement interface
   (FCI).  [RFC8008] defines precisely the semantics of FCI and provides
   guidelines on the FCI protocol, but the exact protocol is explicitly
   outside the scope of that document.  This document defines an FCI
   protocol using the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
   protocol, following the guidelines defined in [RFC8008].

1.  Introduction

   The ability to interconnect multiple content delivery networks (CDNs)
   has many benefits, including increased coverage, capability, and
   reliability.  The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI)
   framework [RFC6707] defines four interfaces to achieve the
   interconnection of CDNs: (1) the CDNI Request Routing Interface; (2)
   the CDNI Metadata Interface; (3) the CDNI Logging Interface; and (4)
   the CDNI Control Interface.

   Among the four interfaces, the CDNI Request Routing Interface
   provides key functions, as specified in [RFC6707]: "The CDNI Request
   Routing interface enables a Request Routing function in an Upstream
   CDN to query a Request Routing function in a Downstream CDN to
   determine if the Downstream CDN is able (and willing) to accept the
   delegated Content Request.  It also allows the Downstream CDN to
   control what should be returned to the User Agent in the redirection
   message by the upstream Request Routing function."  At a high level,
   the scope of the CDNI Request Routing Interface, therefore, contains
   two main tasks: (1) determining if the dCDN (downstream CDN) is
   willing to accept a delegated content request, and (2) redirecting
   the content request coming from a uCDN (upstream CDN) to the proper
   entry point or entity in the dCDN.

   Correspondingly, the request routing interface is broadly divided
   into two functionalities: (1) the CDNI Footprint & Capabilities

Internet-Draft             CDNI FCI using ALTO             February 2020


   Advertisement interface (FCI) defined in [RFC8008], and (2) the CDNI
   Request Routing Redirection interface (RI) defined in [RFC7975].
   Since this document focuses on the first functionality (CDNI FCI),
   below is more details about it.

   Specifically, CDNI FCI allows both an advertisement from a dCDN to a
   uCDN (push) and a query from a uCDN to a dCDN (pull) so that the uCDN
   knows whether it can redirect a particular user request to that dCDN.

   A key component in defining CDNI FCI is defining objects describing
   the footprints and capabilities of a dCDN.  Such objects are already
   defined in [RFC8008].  A protocol to transport and update such
   objects between a uCDN and a dCDN, however, is not defined.  Hence,
   the scope of this document is to define such a protocol by
   introducing a new Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
   [RFC7285] service called "CDNI FCI Service".

   There are multiple benefits in using ALTO as a transport protocol, as
   discussed in Section 2.2.

   The rest of this document is organized as follows.  Section 2
   provides non-normative background on both CDNI FCI and ALTO.
   Section 3 introduces the most basic service, called "CDNI FCI
   Service", to realize CDNI FCI using ALTO.  Section 4 demonstrates a
   key benefit of using ALTO: the ability to integrate CDNI FCI with
   ALTO network maps.  Such integration provides new granularity to
   describe footprints.  Section 5 introduces "Filtered CDNI FCI
   Service" to allow a uCDN to get footprints with given capabilities
   instead of getting the full resource, which can be large.  Section 6
   further shows another benefit of using ALTO: the ability to query
   footprint properties using ALTO unified properties.  In this way, a
   uCDN can effectively fetch capabilities of footprints in which it is
   interested.  IANA and security considerations are discussed in
   Section 7 and Section 8 respectively.

2.  Background

   The design of CDNI FCI transport using ALTO depends on the
   understanding of both FCI semantics and ALTO.  Hence, this document
   starts with a non-normative review for both.  The review uses the
   terminologies for CDNI as defined in [RFC6707], [RFC8006] and
   [RFC8008]; those for ALTO as defined in [RFC7285] and [I-D.ietf-alto-
   unified-props-new].

2.1.  Semantics of FCI Advertisement

   [RFC8008] (CDNI "Footprint and Capabilities Semantics") defines the
   semantics of CDNI FCI, provides guidance on what Footprint and
   Capabilities mean in a CDNI context, and specifies the requirements
   on the CDNI FCI transport protocol.  The definitions in [RFC8008]
   depend on [RFC8006].  Below is a non-normative review of key related
   points of [RFC8008] and [RFC8006].  For detailed information and
   normative specification, the reader is referred to these two RFCs.

   o  Multiple types of mandatory-to-implement footprints (ipv4cidr,
      ipv6cidr, asn, and countrycode) are defined in [RFC8006].  A "Set
      of IP-prefixes" can contain both full IP addresses (i.e., a /32
      for IPv4 or a /128 for IPv6) and IP prefixes with an arbitrary
      prefix length.  There must also be support for multiple IP address
      versions, i.e., IPv4 and IPv6, in such a footprint.

   o  Multiple "base" capabilities are defined [TODO: which RFC].  By
      "base" capabilities, they are required in all cases and therefore
      constitute mandatory capabilities to be supported by the CDNI FCI:
      (1) Delivery Protocol, (2) Acquisition Protocol, (3) Redirection
      Mode, (4) Capabilities related to CDNI Logging, and (5)
      Capabilities related to CDNI Metadata.

   o  Footprint and capabilities are defined together and cannot be
      interpreted independently from each other.  Specifically,
      [RFC8008] integrates footprint and capabilities with an approach
      of "capabilities with footprint restrictions", by expressing
      capabilities on a per footprint basis.

   o  Specifically, for all mandatory-to-implement footprint types,
      footprints can be viewed as constraints for delegating requests to
      a dCDN: A dCDN footprint advertisement tells the uCDN the
      limitations for delegating a request to the dCDN.  For IP prefixes
      or ASN(s), the footprint signals to the uCDN that it should
      consider the dCDN a candidate only if the IP address of the
      request routing source falls within the prefix set (or ASN,
      respectively).  The CDNI specifications do not define how a given
      uCDN determines what address ranges are in a particular ASN.
      Similarly, for country codes, a uCDN should only consider the dCDN
      a candidate if it covers the country of the request routing
      source.  The CDNI specifications do not define how a given uCDN
      determines the country of the request routing source.  Multiple
      footprint constraints are additive, i.e., the advertisement of
      different types of footprint narrows the dCDN candidacy
      cumulatively.

   o  Given that a large part of Footprint and Capabilities
      Advertisement may actually happen in contractual agreements, the
      semantics of CDNI Footprint and Capabilities advertisement refers
      to answering the following question: what exactly still needs to
      be advertised by the CDNI FCI?  For instance, updates about
      temporal failures of part of a footprint can be useful information
      to convey via the CDNI FCI.  Such information would provide
      updates on information previously agreed in contracts between the
      participating CDNs.  In other words, the CDNI FCI is a means for a
      dCDN (downstream CDN) to provide changes/updates regarding a
      footprint and/or capabilities that it has prior agreed to serve in
      a contract with a uCDN (upstream CDN).  Hence, server push and
      incremental encoding will be necessary techniques.

2.2.  ALTO Background and Benefits

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285] defines an
   approach for conveying network layer (topology) information to
   "guide" the resource provider selection process in distributed
   applications that can choose among several candidate resources
   providers to retrieve a given resource.  Usually, it is assumed that
   an ALTO server conveys information that these applications cannot
   measure or have difficulty measuring themselves [RFC5693].

   Originally, ALTO was motivated by optimizing cross-ISP traffic
   generated by P2P applications [RFC5693].  However, ALTO can also be
   used for improving the request routing in CDNs.  In particular, the
   CDNI problem statement [RFC6707] explicitly mentions ALTO as a
   candidate protocol for "actual algorithms for selection of CDN or
   Surrogate by Request-Routing systems".

   The following reasons make ALTO a suitable candidate protocol for
   dCDN (downstream CDN) selection as part of CDNI request routing and,
   in particular, for an FCI protocol:

   o  ALTO is a protocol specifically designed to improve application
      layer traffic (and application layer connections among hosts on
      the Internet) by providing additional information to applications
      that these applications could not easily retrieve themselves.
      This matches the need of CDNI: a uCDN wants to improve application
      layer CDN request routing by using information (provided by a
      dCDN) that the uCDN could not easily obtain otherwise.  Hence,
      ALTO can help a uCDN to select a proper dCDN by first providing
      dCDNs' capabilities as well as footprints (see Section 3) and then
      providing costs of surrogates in a dCDN by ALTO cost maps.

   o  The semantics of an ALTO network map is an exact match for the
      needed information to convey a footprint by a dCDN, in particular,

Internet-Draft             CDNI FCI using ALTO             February 2020


      if such a footprint is being expressed by IP-prefix ranges.
      Please see Section 4.

   o  Security: The identification between uCDNs and dCDNs is an
      important requirement.  ALTO maps can be signed and hence provide
      inherent integrity protection.  Please see Section 8.

   o  RESTful-Design: The ALTO protocol has undergone extensive
      revisions in order to provide a RESTful design regarding the
      client-server interaction specified by the protocol.  A CDNI FCI
      interface based on ALTO would inherit this RESTful design.  Please
      see Section 3.

   o  Error-handling: The ALTO protocol provides extensive error-
      handling in the whole request and response process (see
      Section 8.5 of [RFC7285]).  A CDNI FCI interface based on ALTO
      would inherit this this extensive error-handling framework.
      Please see Section 5.

   o  Filtered map service: The ALTO map filtering service would allow a
      uCDN to query only for parts of an ALTO map.  For example, the
      ALTO filtered property map service can enable a uCDN to query
      properties of a part of footprints efficiently (see Section 6).

   o  Server-initiated Notifications and Incremental Updates: When the
      footprint or the capabilities of a dCDN change (i.e., unexpectedly
      from the perspective of a uCDN), server-initiated notifications
      would enable a dCDN to inform a uCDN about such changes directly.
      Consider the case where - due to failure - part of the footprint
      of the dCDN is not functioning, i.e., the CDN cannot serve content
      to such clients with reasonable QoS.  Without server-initiated
      notifications, the uCDN might still use a recent network and cost
      map from the dCDN, and therefore redirect requests to the dCDN
      which it cannot serve.  Similarly, the possibility for incremental
      updates would enable efficient conveyance of the aforementioned
      (or similar) status changes by the dCDN to the uCDN.  The newest
      design of ALTO supports server pushed incremental updates
      [I-D.ietf-alto-incr-update-sse].

   o  Content Availability on Hosts: A dCDN might want to express CDN
      capabilities in terms of certain content types (e.g., codecs/
      formats, or content from certain content providers).  The new
      endpoint property for ALTO would enable a dCDN to make such
      information available to a uCDN.  This would enable a uCDN to
      determine whether a dCDN actually has the capabilities for a given
      type of content requested.

Internet-Draft             CDNI FCI using ALTO             February 2020


   o  Resource Availability on Hosts or Links: The capabilities on links
      (e.g., maximum bandwidth) or caches (e.g., average load) might be
      useful information for a uCDN for optimized dCDN selection.  For
      instance, if a uCDN receives a streaming request for content with
      a certain bitrate, it needs to know if it is likely that a dCDN
      can fulfill such stringent application-level requirements (i.e.,
      can be expected to have enough consistent bandwidth) before it
      redirects the request.  In general, if ALTO could convey such
      information via new endpoint properties, it would enable more
      sophisticated means for dCDN selection with ALTO.  ALTO Path
      Vector Extension [I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector] is designed to allow
      ALTO clients to query information such as capacity regions for a
      given set of flows.

3.  CDNI FCI Service

   The ALTO protocol is based on an ALTO Information Service Framework
   which consists of several services, where all ALTO services are
   "provided through a common transport protocol, messaging structure
   and encoding, and transaction model" [RFC7285].  The ALTO protocol
   specification [RFC7285] defines several such services, e.g., the ALTO
   map service.

   This document defines a new ALTO Service called "CDNI FCI Service"
   which conveys JSON objects of media type "application/alto-
   cdnifci+json".  These JSON objects are used to transport
   BaseAdvertisementObject objects defined in [RFC8008]; this document
   specifies how to transport such BaseAdvertisementObject objects via
   the ALTO protocol with the ALTO "CDNI FCI Service".  Similar to other
   ALTO services, this document defines the ALTO information resource
   for the "CDNI FCI Service" as follows.

3.1.  Media Type

   The media type of the CDNI FCI resource is "application/alto-
   cdnifci+json".

3.2.  HTTP Method

   A CDNI FCI resource is requested using the HTTP GET method.

3.3.  Accept Input Parameters

   None.

3.4.  Capabilities

   None.

3.5.  Uses

   The "uses" field SHOULD NOT appear unless the CDNI FCI resource
   depends on some ALTO information resources.  If the CDNI FCI resource
   has some dependent resources, the resource IDs of its dependent
   resources MUST be included into the "uses" field.  This document only
   defines one potential dependent resource for the CDNI FCI resource.
   See Section 4 for details of when and how to use it.  Future
   documents may extend the CDNI FCI resource and allow other dependent
   resources.

3.6.  Response

   The "meta" field of a CDNI FCI response MUST include the "vtag" field
   defined in Section 10.3 of [RFC7285].  This field provides the
   version of the retrieved CDNI FCI resource.

   If a CDNI FCI response depends on an ALTO information resource, it
   MUST include the "dependent-vtags" field, whose value is an array to
   indicate the version tags of the resources used, where each resource
   is specified in "uses" of its IRD entry.

   The data component of an ALTO CDNI FCI response is named "cdni-fci",
   which is a JSON object of type CDNIFCIData:

       object {
           CDNIFCIData cdni-fci;
       } InfoResourceCDNIFCI : ResponseEntityBase;

       object {
           BaseAdvertisementObject capabilities<1..*>;
       } CDNIFCIData;

   Specifically, a CDNIFCIData object is a JSON object that includes
   only one property named "capabilities", whose value is an array of
   BaseAdvertisementObject objects.

   The syntax and semantics of BaseAdvertisementObject are well defined
   in Section 5.1 of [RFC8008].  A BaseAdvertisementObject object
   includes multiple properties, including capability-type, capability-
   value, and footprints, where footprints are defined in
   Section 4.2.2.2 of [RFC8006].

Internet-Draft             CDNI FCI using ALTO             February 2020


   To be self-contained, below is a non-normative specification of
   BaseAdvertisementObject.  As mentioned above, the normative
   specification of BaseAdvertisementObject is in [RFC8008]

       object {
           JSONString capability-type;
           JSONValue capability-value;
           Footprint footprints<0..*>;
       } BaseAdvertisementObject;

       object {
           JSONString footprint-type;
           JSONString footprint-value<1..*>;
       } Footprint;

   For each BaseAdvertisementObject, the ALTO client MUST interpret
   footprints appearing multiple times as if they appeared only once.
   If footprints in a BaseAdvertisementObject is null or empty or not
   appearing, the ALTO client MUST understand that the capabilities in
   this BaseAdvertisementObject have the "global" coverage.

   Note: Further optimization of BaseAdvertisement objects to
   effectively provide the advertisement of capabilities with footprint
   restrictions is certainly possible.  For example, these two examples
   below both describe that the dCDN can provide capabilities
   ["http/1.1", "https/1.1"] for the same footprints.  However, the
   latter one is smaller in its size.

   EXAMPLE 1
       {
         "meta" : {...},
         "cdni-fci": {
           "capabilities": [

               ]
             }
           ]
         }
       }

   Since such optimizations are not required for the basic
   interconnection of CDNs, the specifics of such mechanisms are outside
   the scope of this document.

3.7.1.  IRD Example

   Below is the information resource directory (IRD) of a simple,
   example ALTO server.  The server provides both base ALTO information
   resources (e.g., network maps) and CDNI FCI related information
   resources (e.g., CDNI FCI resource), demonstrating a single,
   integrated environment.

   Specifically, the IRD announces two network maps, one CDNI FCI
   resource without dependency, one CDNI FCI resource depending on a
   network map, one filtered CDNI FCI resource to be defined in
   Section 5, one property map including "cdni-fci-capabilities" as its
   entity property, one filtered property map including "cdni-fci-
   capabilities" and "pid" as its entity properties, and two update
   stream services (one for updating CDNI FCI resources, and the other
   for updating property maps).

   delivery protocol, and https/1.1 acquisition protocol, respectively.

3.7.3.  Incremental Updates Example

   A benefit of using ALTO to provide CDNI FCI resources is that such
   resources can be updated using ALTO incremental updates.  Below is an
   example that also shows the benefit of having both JSON merge patch
   and JSON patch to encode updates.

   At first, an ALTO client requests updates for "my-default-cdnifci",
   and the ALTO server returns the "control-uri" followed by the full
   CDNI FCI response.  Then when there is a change in the delivery-
   protocols in that `http/1.1` is removed (from http/1.1 and https/1.1
   to only https/1.1) due to maintenance of the https/1.1 clusters, the
   ALTO server uses JSON merge patch to encode the change and pushes the
   change to the ALTO client.  Later on, the ALTO server notifies the
   ALTO client that "192.0.2.0/24" is added into the "ipv4" footprint

4.  CDNI FCI Service using ALTO Network Map

4.1.  Network Map Footprint Type: altopid

   The ALTO protocol defines a concept called PID to represent a group
   of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses which can be applied the same management
   policy.  The PID is an alternative to the pre-defined CDNI footprint
   types (i.e., ipv4cidr, ipv6cidr, asn, and countrycode).

   Specifically, a CDNI FCI resource can depend on an ALTO network map
   resource and use a new CDNI Footprint Type called "altopid" to
   compress its CDNI Footprint Payload.

   Specifically, the "altopid" footprint type indicates that the
   corresponding footprint value is a list of PIDNames as defined in
   [RFC7285].  These PIDNames are references of PIDs in a network map
   resource.  Hence a CDNI FCI with "altopid" footprints depends on a
   network map.  For such a CDNI FCI map, the resource id of its
   dependent network map MUST be included in the "uses" field of its IRD
   entry, and the "dependent-vtag" field with a reference to this
   network map MUST be included in its response (see the example in
   Section 4.2.3).

   is to change footprints of http/1.1 Delivery Protocol capability, and
   the second one is to remove "south-france" from the footprints of
   https/1.1 delivery protocol capability.

5.  Filtered CDNI FCI using Capabilities

   Section 3 and Section 4 describe CDNI FCI Service which can be used
   to enable a uCDN to get capabilities with footprints constraints from
   dCDNs.  However, since always getting full CDNI FCI resources from
   dCDNs is inefficient, this document introduces a new service named
   "Filtered CDNI FCI Service", to allow a client to filter a CDNI FCI
   resource using a client-given set of capabilities.  For each entry of
   the CDNI FCI response, an entry will only be returned to the client
   if it contains at least one of the client given capabilities.  The
   relationship between a filtered CDNI FCI resource and a CDNI FCI
   resource is similar to the relationship between a filtered network/
   cost map and a network/cost map.

5.1.  Media Type

   A filtered CDNI FCI resource uses the same media type defined for the
   CDNI FCI resource in Section 3.1.

5.2.  HTTP Method

   A filtered CDNI FCI resource is requested using the HTTP POST method.

5.3.  Accept Input Parameters

   The input parameters for a filtered CDNI FCI resource are supplied in
   the entity body of the POST request.  This document specifies the
   input parameters with a data format indicated by the media type
   "application/alto-cdnifcifilter+json" which is a JSON object of type
   ReqFilteredCDNIFCI, where:

Internet-Draft             CDNI FCI using ALTO             February 2020


      object {
          JSONString capability-type;
          JSONValue capability-value;
      } CDNIFCICapability;

      object {
          [CDNIFCICapability cdni-fci-capabilities<0..*>;]
      } ReqFilteredCDNIFCI;

   with fields:

   capability-type:  The same as Base Advertisement Object's capability-
      type defined in Section 5.1 of [RFC8008].

   capability-value:  The same as Base Advertisement Object's
      capability-value defined in Section 5.1 of [RFC8008].

   cdni-fci-capabilities:  A list of CDNI FCI capabilities defined in
      Section 5.1 of [RFC8008] for which footprints are to be returned.
      If a list is empty or not appearing, the ALTO server MUST
      interpret it as a request for the full CDNI FCI resource.  The
      ALTO server MUST interpret entries appearing in a list multiple
      times as if they appeared only once.  If the ALTO server does not
      define any footprints for a CDNI capability, it MUST omit this
      capability from the response.

5.4.  Capabilities

   None.

5.5.  Uses

   The resource ID of the CDNI FCI resource based on which the filtering
   is performed.

5.6.  Response

   The response MUST indicate an error, using ALTO protocol error
   handling specified in Section 8.5 of the ALTO protocol [RFC7285], if
   the request is invalid.

   Specifically, a filtered CDNI FCI request is invalid if:

   o  the value of "capability-type" is null;

   o  the value of "capability-value" is null;





Seedorf, et al.          Expires August 27, 2020               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft             CDNI FCI using ALTO             February 2020


   o  the value of "capability-value" is inconsistent with "capability-
      type".

   When a request is invalid, the ALTO server MUST return an
   "E_INVALID_FIELD_VALUE" error defined in Section 8.5.2 of [RFC7285],
   and the "value" field of the error message SHOULD indicate this CDNI
   FCI capability.

   The ALTO server returns a filtered CDNI FCI resource for a valid
   request.  The format of a filtered CDNI FCI resource is the same as a
   full CDNI FCI resource (See Section 3.6.)

   The returned CDNI FCI resource MUST contain only
   BaseAdvertisementObject objects whose CDNI capability object is the
   superset of one of CDNI capability object in "cdni-fci-capabilities".
   Specifically, that a CDNI capability object A is the superset of
   another CDNI capability object B means that these two CDNI capability
   objects have the same capability type and mandatory properties in
   capability value of A MUST include mandatory properties in capability
   value of B semantically.  See Section 5.7.2 for a concrete example.

   The version tag included in the "vtag" field of the response MUST
   correspond to the full CDNI FCI resource from which the filtered CDNI
   FCI resource is provided.  This ensures that a single, canonical
   version tag is used independently of any filtering that is requested
   by an ALTO client.

5.7.  Examples

5.7.1.  IRD Example

   The examples below use the same IRD example as in Section 3.7.1.

5.7.2.  Basic Example

   This example filters the full CDNI FCI resource in Section 3.7.2 by
   selecting only the http/1.1 delivery protocol capability.  Only the
   first two BaseAdvertisementObjects in the full resource will be
   returned because the first object's capability is http/1.1 delivery
   protocol and the second object's capability is http/1.1 and https/1.1
   delivery protocols which is the superset of http/1.1 delivery
   protocol.

6.  Query Footprint Properties using ALTO Property Map Service

   Besides the requirement of retrieving footprints of given
   capabilities, another common requirement for uCDN is to query CDNI
   capabilities of given footprints.

   Considering each footprint as an entity with properties including
   CDNI capabilities, a natural way to satisfy this requirement is to
   use the ALTO property map as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new].  This section describes how ALTO
   clients look up properties for individual footprints.  First, it
   describes how to represent footprint objects as entities in the ALTO
   property map.  Second, it provides examples of the full property map
   and the filtered property map supporting CDNI capabilities, and their
   incremental updates.

6.1.  Representing Footprint Objects as Property Map Entities

   A footprint object has two properties: footprint-type and footprint-
   value.  A footprint-value is an array of footprint values conforming
   to the specification associated with the registered footprint type
   ("ipv4cidr", "ipv6cidr", "asn", and "countrycode").  Considering each
   ALTO entity defined in [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new] also has two
   properties: entity domain type and domain-specific identifier, a
   straightforward approach to represent a footprint as an ALTO entity
   is to regard its footprint-type as an entity domain type, and its
   footprint value as a domain-specific identifier.  According to
   [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new], "ipv4" and "ipv6" are two
   predefined entity domain types, which can be used to represent
   "ipv4cidr" and "ipv6cidr" footprints respectively.  However, no
   existing entity domain type can represent "asn" and "countrycode"
   footprints.  To represent footprint-type "asn" and "countrycode",
   this document registers two new domains in Section 7 in addition to
   the ones in [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new].

   Here is an example of representing a footprint object as a set of
   entities in the ALTO property map.

   {"footprint-type": "ipv4cidr", "footprint-value": ["192.0.2.0/24",
   "198.51.100.0/24"]} --> "ipv4:192.168.2.0/24", "ipv4:198.51.100.0/24"

6.1.1.  ASN Domain

   The ASN domain associates property values with Autonomous Systems in
   the Internet.

6.1.1.1.  Entity Domain Type

   asn

6.1.1.2.  Domain-Specific Entity Identifiers

   The entity identifier of an entity in an asn domain is encoded as a
   string consisting of the characters "as" (in lowercase) followed by
   the Autonomous System Number [RFC6793].

6.1.1.3.  Hierarchy and Inheritance

   There is no hierarchy or inheritance for properties associated with
   ASN.

6.1.2.  COUNTRYCODE Domain

   The COUNTRYCODE domain associates property values with countries.

6.1.2.1.  Entity Domain Type

   countrycode

6.1.2.2.  Domain-Specific Entity Identifiers

   The entity identifier of an entity in a countrycode domain is encoded
   as an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code [ISO3166-1] in lowercase.

6.1.2.3.  Hierarchy and Inheritance

   There is no hierarchy or inheritance for properties associated with
   country codes.

6.2.  Examples

6.2.1.  IRD Example

   The examples use the same IRD example given by Section 3.7.1.

6.2.2.  Property Map Example

   This example shows a full property map in which entities are
   footprints and entities' property is "cdni-fci-capabilities".

8.  Security Considerations

   As an extension of the base ALTO protocol ([RFC7285]), this document
   fits into the architecture of the base protocol.  And hence its
   Security Considerations (Section 15 of [RFC7285]) fully apply when
   this extension is provided by an ALTO server.

   In the context of CDNI FCI, additional security considerations should
   be included as follows:

   For authenticity and integrity of ALTO information, an attacker may
   disguise itself as an ALTO server for a dCDN, and provide false
   capabilities and footprints to a uCDN using the CDNI FCI service.
   Such false information may lead a uCDN to (1) select an incorrect
   dCDN to serve user requests, or (2) skip uCDNs in good conditions.

   For potential undesirable guidance from authenticated ALTO
   information, a dCDN can provide a uCDN with limited capabilities and

Internet-Draft             CDNI FCI using ALTO             February 2020


   smaller footprint coverage so that the dCDN can avoid transferring
   traffic for a uCDN which they should have to transfer.

   For confidentiality and privacy of ALTO information, footprint
   properties integrated with ALTO unified property may expose network
   location identifiers (e.g., IP addresses or fine-grained PIDs).

   Without access control of ALTO services, an attacker may conduct
   service degradation attacks.  It may request potentially large, full
   CDNI FCI resources from an ALTO server in a dCDN continuously, to
   consume the bandwidth resources of that ALTO server.  It may also
   query filtered property map services with many smaller individual
   footprints, to consume the computation resources of the ALTO server.

   Protection strategies as described in RFC 7285 should be applied to
   address aforementioned security considerations.  In addition, the
   isolation of full/filtered CDNI FCI resources should also be
   considered.  In particular, if a dCDN signs agreements with multiple
   uCDNs, it must isolate full/ filtered CDNI FCI resources for
   different uCDNs in that uCDNs will not redirect requests which should
   not have to be served by this dCDN to this dCDN and it may not
   disclose extra information to uCDNs.

   One approach to reducing the risk is that a dCDN could consider
   generating URIs of different full/filtered CDNI FCI resources by
   hashing its company ID, a uCDN's company ID as well as their
   agreements.  A dCDN SHOULD avoid exposing all full/filtered CDNI FCI
   resources in one of its IRDs.
