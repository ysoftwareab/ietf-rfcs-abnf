AT = 2 for Floors enables representing altitude in a form more 
value=1.1.  Example: (2) mezzanines between floor 4 and floor 5 
AT = 1  is meters of Altitude defined by the vertical datum 
           specified. Semantics are included in this document (section 
           2.1)

AT = 2  is building Floors of Altitude. Semantics are included in 
           this document (section 2.1)

Datum = 1 is denoting the vertical datum WGS 84 as defined by the 
           EPSG as their CRS Code 4327; CRS Code 4327 also specifies 
           WGS 84 as the vertical datum

Datum = 2 is denoting the vertical datum NAD83 as defined by the 
           EPSG as their CRS Code 4269; North American Vertical Datum 
           of 1988 (NAVD88) is the associated vertical datum for NAD83

           The semantics of this datum pair (#2) is presented in 
           section 2.1 above

Datum = 3 is denoting the vertical datum NAD83 as defined by the 
           EPSG as their CRS Code 4269; Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) is 
           the associated vertical datum for NAD83

           The semantics of this datum pair (#3) is presented in 
           section 2.1 above
