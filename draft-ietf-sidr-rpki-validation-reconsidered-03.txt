1.  Introduction

   This document proposes and alternative to the certificate validation
   procedure specified in RFC6487 that reduces aspects of operational
   fragility in the management of certificates in the RPKI.

2.  Certificate Validation in the RPKI

   As currently defined in section 7.2 of [RFC6487], validation of PKIX
   certificates that conform to the RPKI profile relies on the use of a
   path validation process where each certificate in the validation path
   is required to meet the certificate validation criteria.

   These criteria require in particular that the resources on each
   certificate in the validation path are "encompassed" by the resources
   on the issuing certificate.  The first certificate in the path is
   required to be a trust anchor, and its resources are considered valid
   by definition.

   For example, in the following sequence:

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                  March 2016


     Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
      Issuer TA, Subject TA, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

     Certificate 2:
      Issuer TA, Subject CA1, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

     Certificate 3:
      Issuer CA1, Subject CA2, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

     ROA 1:
      Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate):
      Issuer CA2, Subject R1, Resources 192.0.2.0/24

      Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496

   All certificates in this scenario are considered valid in that the
   resources on each certificate are encompassed by the issuing
   certificate.  The roa "ROA1" is also considered valid here in this
   regard - the prefix is encompassed by the embedded EE certificate.

3.  Operational Considerations

   Resource allocations can change in the RPKI.  And this can lead to
   situations where an "over-claiming" certificate is introduced.

   Consider the following sequence:

     Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
      Issuer TA, Subject TA, Resources 192.168.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

     Certificate 2:
      Issuer TA, Subject CA1, Resources 192.168.2.0/24

     Certificate 3:
      Issuer CA1, Subject CA2, Resources 192.168.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

     ROA 1:
      Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate):
      Issuer CA2, Subject R1, Resources 192.168.2.0/24

      Prefix 192.168.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496

   Here Certificate 2 from the previous example was re-issued by TA to
   CA1 and certain AS resources were removed.  However, CA1 failed to
   re-issue a new Certificate 3 to CA2.  As a result Certificate 3 is
   now over-claiming and considered invalid, and by recursion ROA1
   issued by CA2 is also invalid.

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                  March 2016


   It should be noted that CA2 is not claiming any resources on ROA1
   that it cannot receive on a new Certificate 3.  If CA1 would only re-
   issue a Certificate 3 without the AS resources to CA2, then ROA1
   would be considered valid without the need for any further action by
   CA2.

   [RFC6492] describes the protocol for provisioning resource
   certificates.  In this protocol new resource certificates are always
   issued by request of a child.  If that protocol were strictly
   followed then CA1 would have known that its resource set was about to
   shrink, and it would have known that it issued some of those
   resources to its child CA2.

   The protocol currently lacks normative wording on how CAs should deal
   with this situation, but one can imagine amending the protocol with
   normative instructions that would require CA1 to refuse to request a
   certificate with a shrunk resource set until all of its children
   would have requested new shrunk certificates where applicable.  And
   that would forbid any parent CA to pro-actively re-issue a
   certificate with shrunk resource set before receiving a certificate
   re-issuance request from its child CA.

   In practice such a model is unworkable for the CA higher in the path,
   because it has no control over if and when it can shrink a
   certificate for its children.  Therefore higher level CAs will pro-
   actively re-issue shrunk resource certificates when resources are no
   longer validly held by a child.

   The question here is whether the impact of such a re-issuance should
   be limited to just the resources that seem to be under dispute
   between TA and CA1, or all resources issued to CA2.

4.  An Amended RPKI Certification Validation Process

4.1.  Changes to existing standards

   The following is a amended specification of certificate validation as
   described in section 7.2 item number 6 of certificate validation in
   [RFC6487] that describes the validation of resources in the RPKI
   path:

      The Relying Party MUST keep a set of verified resources for the
      certificate independent of the RFC3779 extension itself, that is
      built up using the following approach:

         For any of the resource extensions that use the "inherit"
         element as described in sections 2.2.3.5 and 3.2.3.3 of
         [RFC3779], the corresponding resources of this type should be

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                  March 2016


         taken from the parent certificate, where this issuer is the
         subject.

         For any other resources the intersection of the quoted
         resources on this certificate and the parent certificate is
         kept.  If any resources were found on this certificate that
         were not present on the parent certificate a warning SHOULD be
         issued to help operators rectify this situation.

      If the the set of verified resources obtained this way is empty,
      then the certificate MUST be considered invalid.

   Note that if this approach would be used in the example we cite in
   section 3 of this document, Certificate 3 would have a verified
   resource set that contains only "192.0.2.0/24", and a warning would
   be issued with regards to resources "AS64496-AS64500".  ROA1 would be
   considered valid because the quoted prefix was also part of the
   verified resource set of the embedded Certificate 4.

4.2.  An example

   Consider the following example under the amended approach:

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                  March 2016


     Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
      Issuer TA, Subject TA, Resources 192.168.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

       Verified resources: 192.168.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500
       Warnings: none

     Certificate 2:
      Issuer TA, Subject CA1, Resources 192.168.2.0/24

       Verified resources: 192.168.2.0/24
       Warnings: none

     Certificate 3:
      Issuer CA1, Subject CA2, Resources 192.168.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

       Verified resources: 192.168.2.0/24
       Warnings: overclaim for AS64496-AS64500

     ROA 1:
      Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate):
      Issuer CA2, Subject R1, Resources 192.168.2.0/24

       Verified resources: 192.168.2.0/24
       Warnings: none

       Prefix 192.168.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496

       ROA1 is considered valid because the prefix matches the verified
       resources on the embedded EE certificate.

     ROA 2:
      Embedded Certificate 5 (EE certificate):
      Issuer CA2, Subject R2, Resources 192.168.3.0/24

       Verified resources: none
       Warnings: overclaim for 192.168.3.0/24

       Prefix 192.168.3.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496

       ROA2 is considered invalid because the prefix does not
       match the verified resources on the embedded EE certificate.
       The amended approach cannot lead to ROAs showing up as valid
       for resources that are not verified on the full path from the
       Trust Anchor down to the ROA.

5.  Security Considerations

   The problem described in section 3 of this document has not occurred
   to date.  So one could consider this a low probability problem today.
   However the potential impact on routing security would be high if the
   inconsistency occurred near the apex of the RPKI hierarchy and would
   invalidate the entirety of the sub-tree located below the point of
   this inconsistency.

   The proposed process does not change the probability of this problem,
   but it limits the impact to just the resources that are under
   dispute.  As far as the authors can see there are no real new
   problems introduced by this approach.

   It should be noted that although this is a problem with a low
   probability today this is largely due to the fact that most current
   RPKI systems use their own Trust Anchor and do not support any large
   number of delegated CAs.  If this changes and the issuance and
   publication of a certificate, by the parent, and its use, by a child,
   are handled by different organisations more commonly, then the
   probability of this problem will increase.

6.  IANA Considerations

   No updates to the registries are suggested by this document.
