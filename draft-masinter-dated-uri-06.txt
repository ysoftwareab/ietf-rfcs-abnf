Abstract

   This document defines a URI scheme, "tdb" ( standing for "Thing
   Described By").  It provides a semantic hook for allowing anyone at
   any time to mint a URI for anything that they can describe.  Such

   URIs may include a timestamp to fix the description at a given date
   or time.

   This URI scheme may reduce the need to define define new URN
   namespaces merely for the purpose of creating stable identifiers.  In
   addition, they provide a ready means for identifying "non-information
   resources" by semantic indirection -- a way of creating a URI for
   anything.

Note

   This document is not a product of any working group.  Many of the
   ideas here have been discussed since 2001.  This document has been
   discussed on the mailing list <uri@w3.org>.  Previous versions have
   couched "tdb" as a URN namespace, and included a "duri" scheme for
   fixing date without indirection, which seems unnecessary.  It was
   originally written as a thought experiment as a way of resolving the
   use/mention problem in semantic web applications, but may have other
   uses.

Internet-Draft             The tdb URI scheme                  July 2009


1.  Overview and Requirements

   The tdb URI scheme here solves several related problems:

1.1.  Easy assignment of permanent identifiers

   The URN specification [RFC1737] allows for many URN namespaces, and
   many have been registered.  However, obtaining an appropriate URN in
   any of the currently defined URN namespaces may be difficult: a
   number of URN namespace registrations have been accompanied by
   comments that no other URN namespace was available for the class of
   documents for which identifiers were wanted.

1.2.  Persistent identifiers

   [RFC1737] defines several requirements for Uniform Resource Names.
   In particular, it requires "persistence":

      Persistence: It is intended that the lifetime of a URN be
      permanent.  That is, the URN will be globally unique forever, and
      may well be used as a reference to a resource well beyond the
      lifetime of the resource it identifies or of any naming authority
      involved in the assignment of its name.

   Many people have wondered how to create globally unique and
   persistent identifiers.  There are a number of URI schemes and URN
   namespaces already registered.  However, an absolute guarantee of
   both uniqueness and persistence is very difficult.

   In some cases, the guarantee of persistence comes through a promise
   of good management practice, such as is encouraged in "Cool URLs
   don't change" [COOL].  However, relying on promise of good management
   practice is not the same as having a design that guarantees
   reliability independent of actual administrative practice.

   A primary design goal for URIs is that they are intended to mean the
   same thing, no matter in what context they appear: a "Uniform" way to
   Identify a Resource.  However, even when URIs have Uniform meaning
   from the point of view of the source of the reference, they don't
   guarantee stability over time.  Despite best efforts and intentions,
   identifying information can change in unpredictable ways: domain
   names can disappear or be reassigned, name assigning organizations
   can change structure, responsibility, disappear, merge, or change in
   unpredictable ways.

   There is a significant dependence in the interpretation of many URNs
   with the concept of "naming authority".  The authority is presumably
   some individual or organization both to insure uniqueness of



Masinter                Expires January 13, 2010                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             The tdb URI scheme                  July 2009


   assignment and also to help with understanding the meaning of the
   link between the name and the named.

   However, authorities, whether individuals or organizations, have a
   lifetime, and must be consulted at some point to understand the
   bindings.  The functioning of names as unique identifiers and holders
   of meaning depends on having a reliable infrastructure of consulting
   the authority or the authorities records to determine the thing
   referenced.

1.3.  URIs for abstractions

   The description of URIs [RFC3986] describes a range for 'Resource'
   that is quite broad:

      This specification does not limit the scope of what might be a
      resource; rather, the term "resource" is used in a general sense
      for whatever might be identified by a URI.  Familiar examples
      include an electronic document, an image, a source of information
      with a consistent purpose (e.g., "today's weather report for Los
      Angeles"), a service (e.g., an HTTP-to-SMS gateway), and a
      collection of other resources.  A resource is not necessarily
      accessible via the Internet; e.g., human beings, corporations, and
      bound books in a library can also be resources.  Likewise,
      abstract concepts can be resources, such as the operators and
      operands of a mathematical equation, the types of a relationship
      (e.g., "parent" or "employee"), or numeric values (e.g., zero,
      one, and infinity).

   One might use a URI such as "mailto:" email address to identify a
   person, or a "http:" URI to identify an abstract comment.  However,
   this leaves the question of how one might identify, within the same
   context, both the system mailbox and the person to which it is
   assigned, or the web page at a http URI and the concept it describes.
   The "tdb" URI scheme allows ready assignment of URIs for abstractions
   that are distinguished from the media content that describes them.

   The goal, then, of the "tdb" URI scheme is to provide a mechanism
   which is, at the same time:

      permanent: The identity of the resource identified is not subject
      to reinterpretation over time.

      explicitly bound: The mechanism by which the identified resource
      can be determined is explicitly included in the URI.

      useful for non-networked items: Allows identification of resources
      outside the network: people, organizations, abstract concepts.

      no administration: The mechanism does not depend on reliable
      administrative processes of authorities for either assignment or
      interpretation.


2.  Syntax

   A tdb URI takes the form:
        duri:<timestamp>:<URI>

   Where <timestamp> is s sequence of digits representing a date and
   time (Section 6) and <URI> is any valid URI.


3.  Semantics

   The tdb URI scheme is intended to be useful for describing entities,
   concepts, abstractions, and other items which may not themselves be
   network accessible resources, but have been at some point described
   by network accessible resources.

   The meaning of a duri is "the resource (or fragment) that was
   identified by the <encoded-URI> (after hex decoding) at the very last
   instant of the date(time) given".

   The intent is to use the inversion of "is a document about".  It is
   common practice to give a reference for a concept by including a
   pointer to a document, segment, phrase that defines the concept.
   "tdb" attempts to capture this practice in URI space.

   For example, one might use "tdb:2008:http://www.ietf.org" as a
   persistent identifier for the Internet Engineering Task Force, as
   described by the "http://www.ietf.org" as of the very last instant of
   the year 2008.

   The "tdb" namespace differs from the URN methods for identifying
   abstractions because the designation of what is actually identified
   by the tdb doesn't depend on knowing the intention of the "assigner"
   of the identifier.  Unlike "tag", "info", "cid", "mid" or related
   schemes, the identification is not dependent on the context of use.

   The "tdb" scheme can be thought of as adding a level of semantic
   indirection to URI resolution.

4.  Use as a Locator

   A tdb URI is not a resource locator in a practical sense.  It allows
   one to know that a resource was described at some point in time, but
   whether the description is still available, or whether that
   description is still meaningful, is ambiguous.


5.  Hierarchy

   The "thing descibed by" a network resource may bear little
   relationship to the "thing described by" a relative pointer, so the
   "tdb" URI scheme seems to have no use cases for using "/" as a
   hierarchical delimiter.


6.  Timestamps in tdb URIs

   It is traditional in convention references and citations in printed
   works to include the date of publication; this practice serves the
   important purpose that the context of the naming can be determined.

   While one could imagine using tdb without a timestamp, it would leave
   the possibility that a reference that is unambiguous at one time
   might become ambiguous at some other time.  There are two ways that
   the date is useful for "tdb": it fixes the time of access of the
   resource, for variable descriptions, and it fixes the time of
   interpretation, for descriptions whose meaning (in natural language)
   might vary.

   A timestamp SHOULD be supplied, since the network resources which
   provide descriptions can also change over time.  The timestamp is
   allowed to be quite broad -- only a year -- or with as much precision
   as needed.  This keeps "tdb" URIs relatively short.  To avoid
   ambiguity, a single instant has been chosen -- for tdb this is "the
   last possible instant of the indicated range".

   A timestamp in the tdb scheme is a simple expression of date,
   optional time, with arbitrary precision.  The goal is to allow
   relatively short expressions with no ambiguity, but also with
   arbitrary precision.  (Other date formats were considered, but
   arbitrary precision syntactic simplicity of only using digits time
   zones not.)

Internet-Draft             The tdb URI scheme                  July 2009


   date = [ year [ month [ day [ hour [ minute [ second [ fraction ]]]]]]]

    year     = 4digit
    month    = 2digit
    day      = 2digit
    hour     = 2digit
    minute   = 2digit
    second   = 2digit
    fraction = *digit

   The representation of a date or time refers to the (open interval)
   instant just before the end of the given date/time range at the
   resolution supplied. 199912 is "just before" 1999, but 19991231 falls
   between them.  If necessary, timestamps can include times and even
   fractional times, so that a generator of tdbs can be arbitrarily
   precise.

   Timestamps are interpreted relative to International Atomic Time
   (TAI) [TAI].  The syntax and semantics are similar to those in
   [RFC2550]; in particular, using TAI avoids ambiguity about time zones
   and difficulties with leap seconds.

   There are actually two dates to consider, with "tdb".  There is the
   date that the resource is obtained, and there is the date that the
   description it makes is read, understood, and used to denote.
   Normally in a literary work in natural language which makes a
   reference to another work, both the reference itself and the work
   referenced are dated, e.g., a footnote in an article written in 1967
   might talk about a "private communication" which itself had a date.
   The difference between a URI and a conventional literary reference is
   the desire to be able to extract the URI from its context and still
   retain its meaning.


7.  Additional Considerations

7.1.  URI schemes for the description resource

   The "tdb" scheme is intended for use with resources which have
   retrievable resources that describe something else -- these
   "description resources" are intended as "information resources".

   For example, use with a "http" URI can be used to refer to the
   subject of a web page (at it was described at the given time.)  This
   can be a way of referring to a web site at some time in the past, or
   an organization that has changed, merged, split, or disappeared.

   Local systems that have known-to-be unique host names can use "file"



Masinter                Expires January 13, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             The tdb URI scheme                  July 2009


   URIs with "tdb", for example,

       tdb:20010814142327:file://this.example.com/c|/temp/test.txt

   since this use is primarily focused on providing a unique way of
   identifying an abstraction, even if the referent of the abstraction
   is not widely known.  (Using 'file:' URIs in this way without a fully
   qualified domain name would not be appropriate, because the
   interpretation is not uniform.)

   One might consider using "tdb" with "data" to designate concepts that
   can be described uniquely briefly inline.  For example,

        tdb:2001:data:,The%20US%20president

   names the concept described by the (text/plain) string "The US
   president" at the very last instant of 2001.  Of course, this
   practice is only useful if the referent of the data is (or was at the
   time) completely unique.  Since "data" does not contain a way to
   designate content-language, the string in question would have to not
   be ambiguous as to its language.  In the case of 'data', there is no
   assigning authority at all; the interpretation of the 'tdb' depend on
   the interpreting community.

   Many URIs identify resources which do not clearly describe anything
   at all.  The "home page" for an organization isn't nearly as good a
   resource to use to describe an organization as the organization's
   "about" page.  But it is up to the minter of the tdb URI to choose
   wisely.

7.2.  Useful timestamps

   Timestamps far in the future are suspect, because the future content
   of a description resource cannot usually reliably predicted.
   Timestamps which preceed the availability of the description resource
   should not be used either.  For example, using a http URI with a
   timestamp before the description resource is also not recommended.

   However, although these practices are not recommended, there is no
   assurance that they haven't been used; by itself, a tdb does not
   constitute an assertion that the description resource was available
   or assigned at the date specified.

   Note that the use of the "very last instant" allows for the
   conventional bibliographic convention that a work published in 2009
   can use "2009" as the date string, to refer to the work in the year
   of publication.

Internet-Draft             The tdb URI scheme                  July 2009


7.3.  Free assignment

   Because of the many possible schemes that can be used in the <URI>
   portion, there should be no difficulty in almost any computational
   process being able to assign tdbs at will.  Of course, it is
   necessary for there to be some resource which is available at some
   point in time, and to have a clock which is accurate to the
   granularity of the frequency of assignment.

7.4.  Resolution

   There no resolution servers or processes for tdb URI.  However, a tdb
   URI might be "resolvable" in the sense that a resource that was
   accessed at a point in time might have the result of that access
   cached or archived in an Internet archive service.  See, for example,
   the "Internet Archive" project [archive].  And the "tdb" is
   "resolvable" in the sense that the description resource can be
   accessed and interpreted.

7.5.  Why Names with Semantics?

   There are a number of URI and URN schemes that create otherwise
   unbound "names", where the scheme only provides for uniqueness, with
   some other agent or process or context providing the authority to
   interpret the meaning of the identifier at some point in the future.
   "tdb" is different, in that it is the agreement between the describer
   (the agent creating the tdb URI) and the receiver of the URI (the
   agent interpreting the tdb URI) to agree upon the semantics without
   any reference to any third party.

7.6.  Avoiding MetaData

   One might consider the date in a tdb URI to be just one piece of
   additional metadata about the URI, and consider adding other pieces
   of metadata as annotation.

   However, the use of the date in a tdb URI is intended primarily as a
   mechanism of accomplishing uniqueness over time.  No other bit of
   metadata or description readily fills that purpose.  Further, the
   date is not descriptive (an assertion about the URI) but merely
   refining.

7.7.  Avoiding tdb

   Many applications of URIs already provide a context of timestamp.
   For example, one could imagine a hypertext system where the URIs
   contained within a document were intended to refer to the resources
   as of the date of the enclosing document.  This would be a reasonable



Masinter                Expires January 13, 2010               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft             The tdb URI scheme                  July 2009


   interpretation of URIs within an Internet archive system, for
   example.

   And some applications of URIs arguably already contain the level of
   interpretive indirection that is explicit with "tdb".  For example,
   one might consider the use of URIs as namespace names within XML
   [namespaces] as a reference to the "thing described by" the URI used.

7.8.  tdb and levels of indirection

   The "tdb" scheme introduces a level of semantic indirection.  The
   puzzles and confusions about use and mention, name and reference, and
   levels of indirection have been puzzling and amusing for quite a
   while.

      "It's long," said the Knight, "but it's very, very beautiful.
      Everybody that hears me sing it--either it brings tears into their
      eyes, or else--"
      "Or else what?" said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden
      pause.
      "Or else it doesn't, you know.  The name of the song is called
      'Haddock's Eyes.'"
      "Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?"  Alice said, trying to
      feel interested.
      "No, you don't understand," the knight said, looking a little
      vexed.  "That's what the name is called.  The name really is 'The
      Aged Aged Man.'"
      "Then I ought to have said 'That's what the song is called'?"
      Alice corrected herself.
      "No, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing!  The song is called
      'Ways and Means': but that's only what it's called, you know!"
      "Well, what is the song, then?" said Alice, who was by this time
      completely bewildered.
      "I was coming to that," the Knight said.  "The song really is
      'A-sitting On A Gate': and the tune's my own invention."  [LOOK]


8.  URI Specification Template

   URI scheme syntax:  Briefly, the syntax is
      tdb:<date>:<URI>
      The syntax is described in this document.

   URI scheme semantics:  Semantic indirection at indicated date.
      Semantics are described in detail in this document.

   Encoding considerations:  tdb URIs consist of a prefix followed by
      another URI, and should have the same encoding considerations as
      others.

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:  This scheme
      was designed to resolve some of the use/mention ambiguities in
      semantic web applications that wish to "denote" concepts and other
      ideas and not just access resources over the Internet.

   Interoperability considerations:  Existing semantic web applications
      may have other means of fixing meaning at a particular time or
      semantic indirection, but this should not in itself cause
      interoperability difficulties.

   Security considerations:  See Section 10 of this document.

9.  IANA considerations

   This document includes a URI scheme registration (Section 8 that
   should be entered into the IANA registry of URI schemes as a
   permanent registration (once approved.)


10.  Security Considerations

   "tdb" identifiers are not any more reliable because they have dates.
   URIs don't contain enough information to supply the authority for
   deciding what was or wasn't at a given URI at a given date.
