                   CBOR Profile of X.509 Certificates
                  draft-raza-ace-cbor-certificates-04

Abstract

   This document specifies a CBOR encoding and profiling of X.509 public
   key certificate suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) deployments.
   The full X.509 public key certificate format and commonly used ASN.1
   DER encoding is overly verbose for constrained IoT environments.
   Profiling together with CBOR encoding reduces the certificate size
   significantly with associated known performance benefits.

   The CBOR certificates are compatible with the existing X.509
   standard, enabling the use of profiled and compressed X.509
   certificates without modifications in the existing X.509 standard.

1.  Introduction

   One of the challenges with deploying a Public Key Infrastructure
   (PKI) for the Internet of Things (IoT) is the size and encoding of
   X.509 public key certificates [RFC5280], since those are not
   optimized for constrained environments [RFC7228].  More compact
   certificate representations are desirable.  Due to the current PKI
   usage of X.509 certificates, keeping X.509 compatibility is necessary
   at least for a transition period.  However, the use of a more compact

   encoding with the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)
   [RFC7049] reduces the certificate size significantly which has known
   performance benefits in terms of decreased communication overhead,
   power consumption, latency, storage, etc.

   CBOR is a data format designed for small code size and small message
   size.  CBOR builds on the JSON data model but extends it by e.g.
   encoding binary data directly without base64 conversion.  In addition
   to the binary CBOR encoding, CBOR also has a diagnostic notation that
   is readable and editable by humans.  The Concise Data Definition
   Language (CDDL) [RFC8610] provides a way to express structures for
   protocol messages and APIs that use CBOR.  [RFC8610] also extends the
   diagnostic notation.

   CBOR data items are encoded to or decoded from byte strings using a
   type-length-value encoding scheme, where the three highest order bits
   of the initial byte contain information about the major type.  CBOR
   supports several different types of data items, in addition to
   integers (int, uint), simple values (e.g. null), byte strings (bstr),
   and text strings (tstr), CBOR also supports arrays [] of data items,
   maps {} of pairs of data items, and sequences of data items.  For a
   complete specification and examples, see [RFC7049], [RFC8610], and
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-sequence].

   This document specifies the CBOR certificate profile, which is a CBOR
   based encoding and compression of the X.509 certificate format.  The
   profile is based on previous work on profiling of X.509 certificates
   for Internet of Things deployments [RFC7925] [X.509-IoT] which
   retains backwards compatibility with X.509, and can be applied for
   lightweight certificate based authentication with e.g.  TLS
   [RFC8446], DTLS [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13], or EDHOC
   [I-D.selander-ace-cose-ecdhe].  The same profile can be used for
   "native" CBOR encoded certificates, which further optimizes the
   performance in constrained environments but are not backwards
   compatible with X.509, see Section 6.

   Other work has looked at reducing size of X.509 certificates.  The
   purpose of this document is to stimulate a discussion on CBOR based
   certificates.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification makes use of the terminology in [RFC7228].

3.  CBOR Encoding

   This section specifies the content and encoding for CBOR
   certificates.  The CBOR certificate can be a native CBOR certificate,
   in which case the signature is calculated on the CBOR encoded data,
   or a CBOR compressed X.509 certificates in which case the signature
   is calculated on the DER encoded ASN.1 data in the X.509 certificate.
   In both cases the certificate content is adhering to the restrictions
   given by [RFC7925].  The corresponding ASN.1 schema is given in
   Appendix A.

   The encoding and compression has several components including: ASN.1
   DER and base64 encoding are replaced with CBOR encoding, static
   fields are elided, and elliptic curve points are compressed.  The
   X.509 fields and there CBOR encodings are listed below.  Combining
   these different components reduces the certificate size
   significantly, something that is not possible with general purpose
   compressions algorithms, see Figure 1.

   CBOR certificates are defined in terms of RFC 7925 profiled X.509
   certificates:

   o  version.  The 'version' field is known (fixed to v3), and is
      omitted in the CBOR encoding.

   o  serialNumber.  The 'serialNumber' field is encoded as a CBOR byte
      string.

   o  signature.  The 'signature' field is always the same as the
      'signatureAlgorithm' field and always omitted from the CBOR
      encoding.

   o  issuer.  In the general case, the Distinguished Name is encoded as
      CBOR map, but if only CN is present the value can be encoded as a
      single text value.

   o  validity.  The 'notBefore' and 'notAfter' UTCTime fields are
      encoded as as UnixTime in unsigned integer format.

   o  subject.  The 'subject' field is restricted to specifying the
      value of the common name.  By RFC 7925 an IoT subject is
      identified by either an EUI-64 for clients, or by a FQDN for
      servers.  An EUI-64 mapped from a 48-bit MAC address is encoded as
      a CBOR byte string of length 6.  Other EUI-64 is ncoded as a CBOR
      byte string of length 8.  A FQDN is encoded as a CBOR text string.

Internet-Draft     CBOR Profile of X.509 Certificates         March 2020


   o  subjectPublicKeyInfo.  If the 'algorithm' field is the default
      (id-ecPublicKey and prime256v1), it is omitted in the CBOR
      encoding., otherwise it is included in the
      subjectPublicKeyInfo_algorithm field encoded as a int, (see
      Section 9).  The 'subjectPublicKey' is encoded as as a CBOR byte
      string.  Public keys of type id-ecPublicKey are point compressed
      as defined in Section 2.3.3 of [SECG].

   o  extensions.  The 'extensions' field is encoded as a CBOR array
      where each extension is represented with an int.  The extensions
      mandated to be supported by RFC 7925 is encodeded as specified
      below, where a critical extensions are encoded with a negative
      sign.

      I.e. non-critical keyUsage keyAgreement is encoded as 5, critical
      basicConstraints cA is encodes as -3, and non-criticical
      extKeyUsage id-kp-codeSigning + id-kp-OCSPSigning is encoded as
      22.

      If subjectAltName is present, the value is placed at the end of
      the array encoded as a byte or text string following the encoding
      rules for the subject field.  If the array contains a single int,
      extensions is encoded as the int instead of an array.

      subjectAltName = 1

      basicConstraints = 2 + cA

      keyUsage = 3 + digitalSignature
               + 2 * keyAgreement + 4 * keyCertSign

      extKeyUsage = 10 + id-kp-serverAuth + 2 * id-kp-clientAuth
                  + 4 * id-kp-codeSigning + 8 * id-kp-OCSPSigning

   o  signatureAlgorithm.  If the 'signatureAlgorithm' field is the
      default (ecdsa-with-SHA256) it is omitted in the CBOR encoding,
      otherwise it is included in the signatureAlgorithm field encoded
      as an CBOR int (see Section 9).

   o  signatureValue.  Since the signature algorithm and resulting
      signature length are known, padding and extra length fields which
      are present in the ASN.1 encoding are omitted and the
      'signatureValue' field is encoded as a CBOR byte string.  For
      native CBOR certificates the signatureValue is calculated over the
      certificate CBOR sequence excluding the signatureValue.

   In addition to the above fields present in X.509, the CBOR ecoding
   introduces an additional field

   o  type.  A CBOR int used to indicate the type of CBOR certificate.
      Currently type can be a native CBOR certificate (type = 0) or a
      CBOR compressed X.509 certificates (type = 1), see Section 9.

   The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) for CBOR certificate is:

   certificate = (
      type : int,
      serialNumber : bytes,
      issuer : { + int => bytes } / text,
      validity_notBefore: uint,
      validity_notAfter: uint,
      subject : text / bytes
      subjectPublicKey : bytes
      extensions : [ *4 int, ? text / bytes ] / int,
      signatureValue : bytes,
      ? ( signatureAlgorithm : int,
          subjectPublicKeyInfo_algorithm : int )
   )

   The signatureValue for native CBOR certificates is calculated over
   the CBOR sequence:

   (
      type : int,
      serialNumber : bytes,
      issuer : { + int => bytes } / text,
      validity_notBefore: uint,
      validity_notAfter: uint,
      subject : text / bytes
      subjectPublicKey : bytes
      extensions : [ *4 int, ? text / bytes ] / int,
      ? ( signatureAlgorithm : int,
          subjectPublicKeyInfo_algorithm : int )
   )

   TODO - Specify exactly how issuer is encoded into a map / text and
   back again.

4.  Deployment settings

   CBOR certificates can be deployed with legacy X.509 certificates and
   CA infrastructure.  In order to verify the signature, the CBOR
   certificate is used to recreate the original X.509 data structure to
   be able to verify the signature.

   For the currently used DTLS v1.2 protocol, where the handshake is
   sent unencrypted, the actual encoding and compression can be done at

Internet-Draft     CBOR Profile of X.509 Certificates         March 2020


   different locations depending on the deployment setting.  For
   example, the mapping between CBOR certificate and standard X.509
   certificate can take place in a 6LoWPAN border gateway which allows
   the server side to stay unmodified.  This case gives the advantage of
   the low overhead of a CBOR certificate over a constrained wireless
   links.  The conversion to X.509 within an IoT device will incur a
   computational overhead, however, this is negligible compared to the
   reduced communication overhead.

   For the setting with constrained server and server-only
   authentication, the server only needs to be provisioned with the CBOR
   certificate and does not perform the conversion to X.509.  This
   option is viable when client authentication can be asserted by other
   means.

   For DTLS v1.3, because certificates are encrypted, the proposed
   encoding needs to be done fully end-to-end, through adding the
   encoding/decoding functionality to the server.  This corresponds to
   the proposed native mode, a new certificate compression scheme.  The
   required changes on the server side are in line with recent protocols
   utilizing cbor encoding for communication with resource constrained
   devices [RFC8613].

5.  Expected Certificate Sizes

   The CBOR encoding of the sample certificate given in Appendix A
   results in the numbers shown in Figure 1.  After RFC 7925 profiling,
   most duplicated information has been removed, and the remaining text
   strings are minimal in size.  Therefore the further size reduction
   reached with general compression mechanisms will be small, mainly
   corresponding to making the ASN.1 endcoding more compact.  The zlib
   number was calculated with zlib-flate.

   zlib-flate -compress < cert.der > cert.compressed

   +------------------+--------------+------------+--------------------+
   |                  |   RFC 7925   |    zlib    |  CBOR Certificate  |
   +------------------+---------------------------+--------------------+
   | Certificate Size |     314      |     295    |         136        |
   +------------------+--------------+------------+--------------------+

             Figure 1: Comparing Sizes of Certificates (bytes)

6.  Native CBOR Certificates

   Further performance improvements can be achieved with the use of
   native CBOR certificates.  In this case the signature is calculated
   over the CBOR encoded structure rather than the ASN.1 encoded



Raza, et al.           Expires September 10, 2020               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     CBOR Profile of X.509 Certificates         March 2020


   structure.  This removes entirely the need for ASN.1 and reduces the
   processing in the authenticating devices.

   This solution applies when the devices are only required to
   authenticate with a set of native CBOR certificate compatible
   servers, which may become a preferred approach for future
   deployments.  The mapping between X.509 and CBOR certificates enables
   a migration path between the backwards compatible format and the
   fully optimized format.  This motivates introducing a type flag to
   indicate if the certificate should be restored to X.509 or kept cbor
   encoded.

7.  Security Considerations

   The CBOR profiling of X.509 certificates does not change the security
   assumptions needed when deploying standard X.509 certificates but
   decreases the number of fields transmitted, which reduces the risk
   for implementation errors.

   Conversion between the certificate formats can be made in constant
   time to reduce risk of information leakage through side channels.

   The current version of the format hardcodes the signature algorithm
   which does not allow for crypto agility.  A COSE crypto algorithm can
   be specified with small overhead, and this changed is proposed for a
   future version of the draft.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   The mechanism in this draft does not reveal any additional
   information compared to X.509.

   Because of difference in size, it will be possible to detect that
   this profile is used.

   The gateway solution described in Section 4 requires unencrypted
   certificates.
