Abstract

   The Secure Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (SAODV) is an extension
   of the AODV routing protocol that can be used to protect the route
   discovery mechanism providing security features like integrity,
   authentication and non-repudiation.

Internet DRAFT                    SAODV                   11 August 2004


1. Introduction

   Manet protocols are being designed without having security in mind.
   In most of their specifications it is assumed that all the nodes in
   the network are friendly. The security issue has been postponed and
   there is the common feeling that it is going to be possible to make
   those routing protocols secure by retrofitting pre-existing
   cryptosystems.

   Nevertheless, securing network transmissions without securing the
   routing protocols is not sufficient. Moreover, by retrofitting
   cryptosystems (like IPSec) security is not necessarily achieved.

   Therefore, in manet networks with security needs, there must be two
   security systems: one to protect the data transmission and one to
   make the routing protocol secure. There are already well studied peer
   to peer security systems that can be used for protecting network
   transmissions. But there is no much work about how make manet routing
   protocols discover routes in a secure manner [6] [7].

   In this memo the reader will find a way to add security to AODV[1]
   via a protocol extension. It would be interesting to see if the
   solution proposed in this paper could be adapted to other manet
   protocols.

2. Preliminary notes

   It is important to have in mind that this paper is describing how to
   protect the routing messages, not the data messages. This section
   contains some preliminary notes about which security features SAODV
   provides, and IPSec interacting with SAODV.

2.1. Security Features

   Before designing a protocol extension that provides security to AODV
   it is required to think what are the security needs and what issues
   just cannot be solved. The main thing that cannot be avoid is that
   there might be malicious nodes that do not respect protocols (they
   will forge AODV packets, listen to the others, reply packets in their
   own interests, report errors where there are none, etc).

   It is needed to have integrity, authentication and non-repudiation.
   It is also desired to have a way to avoid tampering attacks, like
   delaying or reusing packets (in AODV this can be solved by using the
   sequence numbers). But what about confidentiality? Well, maybe it is
   needed for scenarios with a very high security needs, but it does not
   make sense if the scenario is a public ad hoc network that everybody
   can joint at any moment. Therefore, it is not taken into account in

   the proposed protocol extension.

   Concerning availability, of course it is desired, but prevent denial-
   of-service attacks in a network that uses wireless technology is
   quite impossible when an attacker can just focus in the physical
   layer instead of attacking the routing protocol. Of course military
   scenarios are the most likely to suffer such kind of attacks. Anyway,
   being in a less security demanding scenario, and although denial-of-
   service attacks in general are not easy to stop, it is desirable to
   have some measures that make availability more difficult to broke.

2.2. Interaction with IPSec

   When trying to use IPSec to secure network transmissions in a manet
   network, it is needed that the IPSec implementation can use as a
   selector the TCP or UDP port number. Sadly, there are quite many
   implementations that cannot do that. The importance of that is
   because it is needed that the IPSec policy will be able to apply
   certain security mechanisms to the data packets and just bypass the
   routing packets.

3. Overview

   The solution presented in this paper is an extension of the AODV
   protocol mainly by using new extension messages. In these extension
   messages there is a signature created by digesting the AODV packet
   using the private key of the original sender of the Routing message
   (not of the intermediate nodes that just forward it).

   Concerning to RREQ and RREP messages there are two alternatives: The
   first one in which only final destinations are allowed to reply a
   RREQ, and the second in which there is no such limitation.

   In the first one, when a RREQ is sent, the sender signs the message.
   Intermediate nodes verify the signature before creating or updating a
   reverse route to that host. And only if the signature is fine they
   store the reverse route. The final destination node signs the RREP
   with its private key. Intermediate and final nodes, again verify the
   signature before creating or updating a route to that host, also
   storing the signature with the route entry.

   In the second one, when a RREQ is sent, the sender signs the message.
   Intermediate nodes verify the signature before creating or updating a
   reverse route to that host. And, again, only if the signature is fine
   they store the reverse route. But the difference is that the RREQ
   message has also a second signature that is always stored with the
   reverse route. This second signature is needed to be added in the
   gratuitous RREPs of that RREQ and in regular RREPs to future RREQs

   that the node might reply as an intermediate nodes. An intermediate
   node that wants to reply a RREQ needs not only the correct route, but
   also the signature corresponding to that route to add it in the RREP
   and the lifetime that came in the same message tha the signature.
   When this happens, it generates the RREP, (adding the stored
   signature and lifetime) signs the actual lifetime and sends it. All
   the nodes that receive the RREP and that update the route store the
   signature and lifetime with that route.

   Hello messages are RREP messages, so they are signed in the same way.

   Extension messages that include a second signature also include the
   RREP fields (flags and prefix size) that are not derivable from the
   RREQ but not zeroed when computing the signature.

   RREP-ACK messages may be authentified by using a digital signature,
   that might be verified by any one that receives them.

   Every node, generating or forwarding a RERR message, uses digital
   signatures to sign the whole message and any neigbour that receives
   verifies the signature.

   The hop count of all these messages is authentified by using a hash
   chain.

4. Terminology

   This memo uses the conventional meanings [2] for the capitalized
   words MUST, SHOULD and MAY. It also uses terminology taken from the
   specifications of AODV [1] and IPSec [3].

   Prefix Size  The prefix size field for the RREP.

   Top Hash     The top hash for the hop count authentication. This
                field has variable length, but it must be 32-bits
                aligned.

   Signature Method ... Padding
                The same than in RREQ (Single) Signature Extension.

   Signature    The signature of the all the fields in the AODV packet
                that are before this field but the Hop Count field. This
                field has variable length, but it must be 32-bits
                aligned.

   Signature for RREP
                The signature that should be put into the Signature
                field of the RREP Double Signature Extension when an
                intermediate node (that has previously received this
                RREQ and created a reverse route) wants to generate a
                RREP for a route to the source of this RREQ. This field
                has variable length, but it must be 32-bits aligned.
                Both signatures are generated by the requesting node.

   Hash         The hash corresponding to the actual hop count. This
                field has variable length, but it must be 32-bits

14. SAODV Operation

   This section describes how SAODV allows to authenticate the AODV
   routing data. Two mechanisms are used to achieve this: hash chains
   and signatures.

14.1. SAODV Signatures

   When calculating signatures, Hop Count field is always zeroed,
   because it is a mutable field. In the case of the Signature for RREP
   field of the RREQ Double Signature Extension, what is signed is the
   future RREP message that nodes might send back in response to the
   RREQ. To construct this message it uses the values of the RREQ and
   its Prefix Size. It also decides which are going to be the values of
   the R and A flags.

   Every time a node generates a RREQ it decides if it should be signed
   with a Single Signature Extension or with a Double Signature
   Extension. All implementations MUST support RREQ Single Signature
   Extension, and SHOULD support RREQ Double Signature Extension. A node
   that generates a RREQ with the gratuitous RREP flag set SHOULD sign
   the RREQ with a Double Signature Extension. A node SHOULD never
   generate a RREQ without adding a Signature Extension.

   When a node receives a RREQ, first verify the signature before
   creating or updating a reverse route to that host. Only if the
   signature is verified, it will store the route. If the RREQ was
   received with a Double Signature Extension, then the node will also
   store the signature and the lifetime (that is REV_ROUTE_LIFE) for the
   RREP in the route entry.

   If a node receives a RREQ without a Signature Extension it SHOULD
   drop it.

   An intermediate node will reply a RREQ with a RREP only if fulfills
   the AODV requirements to do so, and the node has the corresponding
   signature and old lifetime to put into the Signature and Old Lifetime
   fields of the RREP Double Signature Extension. Otherwise, it will
   rebroadcast the RREQ.

   When a RREQ is received by the destination itself, it will reply with
   a RREP only if fulfills the AODV requirements to do so. This RREP
   will be sent with a RREP Single Signature Extension.

   All implementations MUST support RREP Single Signature Extension, and
   SHOULD support RREP Double Signature Extension. A node SHOULD never
   generate a RREP without adding a Signature Extension. This also
   applies to gratuitous RREPs.

Internet DRAFT                    SAODV                   11 August 2004


   When a node receives a RREP, first verifies the signature before
   creating or updating a route to that host. Only if the signature is
   verified, it will store the route with the signature and the lifetime
   of the RREP. If a node receives a RREP without a Signature Extension
   it SHOULD drop it.

   Every node, generating or forwarding a RERR message, uses digital
   signatures to sign the whole message and any neigbour that receives
   verifies the signature. In this way it can verify that the sender of
   the RERR message is really the one that claims to be. And, since
   destination sequence numbers are not singed by the corresponding
   node, a node SHOULD never update any destination sequence number of
   its routing table based on a RRER message.

   Although nodes will not trust destination sequence numbers in a RERR
   message, they will use them to decide whether they should invalidate
   a route or not.

   RREP-ACK messages MAY be authentified by using the RREP-ACK Signature
   Extension.

   The block 'Signature Method ... Padding' is included before the
   'Signature' field in all the extension messages, and before the
   'Signature of the new Lifetime' field in the RREQ-DSE message.

   This is the list of possible values of the Signature Method field:

                RESERVED        0
                RSA             1
                Elliptic Curve  2
                Reserved        3-127
                Implementation
                dependent       128-255

   All the implementations MUST support the RSA option.

14.2. SAODV Hash Chains

   Hash chains are used in SAODV to authenticate the hop count of the
   AODV routing messages (not only by the end points, but by any node
   that receives one of those messages.

   Every time a node wants to send a RREQ or a RREP it generates a
   random number (seed). Selects a Maximum Hop Count. Maximum Hop Count
   SHOULD be set to the TTL value in the IP header, and it SHOULD never
   exceed its configuration parameter NET_DIAMETER. The Hash field in
   the Signature Extension is set to the seed. The Top Hash field is set
   to the seed hashed Max Hop Count times.

Internet DRAFT                    SAODV                   11 August 2004


   Every time a node receives a RREQ or a RREP it verifies the hop count
   by hashing Max Hop Count - Hop Count times the Hash field, and
   checking that the resultant value is the same than the Top Hash. If
   the check fails, the node SHOULD drop the packet.

   Before rebroadcasting a RREQ or forwarding a RREP, a node hashes one
   time the Hash field in the Signature Extension.

   The function used to compute the hash is set in the Hash Function
   field. Since this field is signed, a forwarding node will only be
   able to use the same hash function that the originator of the routing
   message has selected. If an node cannot verify or forward a routing
   message because it does not support the hash function that has been
   used, then it drops the packet.

   This is the list of possible values of the Hash Function field:

                RESERVED        0
                MD5HMAC96       1
                SHA1HMAC96      2
                Reserved        3-127
                Implementation
                dependent       128-255

   All the implementations MUST support the HMAC-SHA-1-96 option.

14.3. SAODV Delayed Verification of Signatures

   The signatures in route requests and route replies will be verified
   after the node has forwarded the route reply. In this way
   transmissions of the route requests and replies occur without any
   kind of delay due to the verification of the signatures.

   Following the same idea, the signature of route error messages will
   also be verified after forwarding them.

   Routes pending of verification will not be used to forward any
   packet. If a packet arrives for a node for which there is a route
   pending of verification.  The node will have to verify it before
   using that route. If the verification fails, it will delete the route
   and request a new one.

14.4. SAODV Key Management

   This section describes a key management scheme that MAY be used with
   SAODV and AODVv6.

   SAODV can generate the IP addresses is very similar to the generation

Internet DRAFT                    SAODV                   11 August 2004


   of SUCV (Statistically Unique and Cryptographically Verifiable)
   addresses [8]. SUCV addresses where designed to protect Binding
   Updates in Mobile IPv6. The main difference between SUCV and the
   method proposed in here is that SUCV addresses are generated by
   hashing an "imprint" in addition to the public key. That imprint
   (that can be a random value) is used to limit certain attacks related
   to Mobile IP.

   In SAODV, the address can be a network prefix of 64 bits with a 64
   bit SAODV_HID (Half IDentifier) or a 128 bit SAODV_FID (Identifier).
   These two identifiers are generated almost in the same way than the
   sucvHID and the sucvID in SUCV (with the difference that they do not
   include an imprint):

   SAODV_HID = SHA1HMAC_64(PublicKey)

   SAODV_FID = SHA1HMAC_128(PublicKey)

   There will be a flag in the SAODV routing message extensions (the 'H'
   flag) that will be set to '1' if the IP address is a HID and to '0'
   if it is a FID.

   Finally, if it has to be a real IPv6 address, there is a couple of
   things that should be done [9].

   If HID is used, then the HID behaves as an interface identifier and,
   therefore, its sixth bit (the universal/local bit) should be set to
   zero (0) to indicate local scope (because the IP address is not
   guaranteed to be globally unique).

   And, if FID is used, then a format prefix corresponding to the manet
   network should be overwritten to the FID. Format prefixes '010'
   through '110' are unassigned and would take only three bits of the
   FID. Format prefixes '1110' through '1111 1110 0' are also unassigned
   and they would take between 4 and 9 bits of the FID. All of these
   format prefixes required to have to have 64-bit interface identifiers
   in EUI-64 format, so universal/local bit should be set to zero (0).

   This section does not propose a scheme for IPv4 since the length of
   an IPv4 address would be too short to provide the statistical
   uniqueness that this scheme requires.

14.4.1. Duplicated IP Address Detection

   If a node 'A' receives a routing message that is signed by a node 'B'
   that has the same IP address than one of the nodes for which 'A' has
   a route entry (node 'C'), it will not process normally that routing
   message. Instead, it will inform 'B' (sending to it a Duplicated

Internet DRAFT                    SAODV                   11 August 2004


   Address (DADD) Detected message) that it is using a duplicated IP and
   it will prove it by adding the public key of 'C' (so 'B' can verify
   the truthfulness of the claim).

   When the node 'B' receives a DADD message that indicates that
   somebody else has the same IP address than itself (or it realizes
   about it by itself), it will have to generate a new pair of
   public/private keys. After that, it will derive its IP address from
   its public key and it MIGHT inform to all the nodes it finds relevant
   (through a broadcast) of which is its new IP address with an special
   message (New Address (NADD) Notification message) that contains: the
   two IP addresses (the old and the new ones) and the two public
   signatures (old and new) signed with the old private key and, all
   this, signed with the new private key. This unicast MIGHT be answered
   with the New Address Acknowledgment (NADD-ACK) Message by the
   receiver if it verifies that everything is in order.

   After this, the node will generate a route error message for his old
   IP address. Its propagation will delete the route entries for the old
   IP address and, therefore, eliminate the duplicated addresses. This
   route error message may have a message extension that tells which is
   the new address. In this way, the nodes that receive the routing
   message can already create the route to the new IP address.

15. Adaptations of AODV that are needed

   According to the AODV RFC [1], the originator of a RREQ can put (on
   purpose) a much more bigger destination sequence number than the real
   one. This allows a very easy attack that consists in setting the
   destination sequence number to 0xFFFFFFFF (the maximum value that
   fits in the 32-bits field). Then, the originator of the RREP and all
   the intermediate nodes will have that as sequence number for the
   route. The next time the node increments the sequence number, its
   sequence number counter will overflow. This might cause completely
   unexpected results, none of them good.

   The fact that the originator of the RREQ can set the sequence number
   of the destination is because it is going to be needed if the
   destination node has rebooted (see section 6.13. 'Actions After
   Reboot' in the AODV RFC [1]). After rebooting, a node does not
   remember its sequence number anymore and trusts anybody that sends to
   it a RREQ with the number. But this just cannot be allowed.

   Therefore, all the AODV-enabled nodes SHOULD have a way to keep their
   destination sequence number even after rebooting. In addition, in the
   case that the destination sequence number in the RREQ is bigger than
   the destination sequence number of the destination node, the
   destination node SHOULD NOT take into account the value in the RREQ.



Guerrero                Expires 11 February 2005               [Page 22]

Internet DRAFT                    SAODV                   11 August 2004


   Instead, it will realize that the originator of the RREQ is
   misbehaving and will send the RREP with the right sequence number.

   Finally, and concerning to the AODV port (the UDP port used to send
   AODV messages), AODV nodes SHOULD never accept AODV messages sent
   from a different port than the standard one.

16. Security Considerations

   The goal of the protocol extension described here, is to achieve that
   a node that plans to build an attack by not behaving according to the
   AODV routing protocol, will be only able to selectively don't reply
   to certain routing messages and to lie about information about
   itself. Nevertheless, It does not much to avoid denial-of-service
   attacks.

   If a malicious node receives a packet and resends it after a while,
   it will not alter the network topology because of the sequence number
   system.

   It might seem that lifetime is not very strongly authentificated in
   the case that intermediate nodes are allowed to reply RREQs, because
   they could lie about the lifetime. Anyway, the goal of the protocol
   extension is achieved, because the node would be only lying about
   itself.

   Using hash chains for authentifying hop counter has a problem: A
   malicious node forwarding a route might not increment the hop counter
   by using the same hash value. If it does so, the subsequent nodes
   will think that this route is one hop shorter (having more chances to
   be chosen as the route to use). This is not really a big threat,
   because to launch an attack, a group of malicious nodes should be
   close to the shortest path (each of the malicious nodes forwarding
   the routing messages would not increment the hop counter), and the
   less malicious nodes are, the more close they have to be to the
   shortest path.  A path that is changing with the time.

   There are still the following open issues:

   1. Is it correct that the RREQ Double Signature Extension fixes the
   values for the R and A flags in the RREP issued by an intermediate
   node? Is there any attacks that could be performed if those flags are
   considered as 'not predictable' ones and, therefore, zeroed for the
   signature computation?

   2. It is not clear yet if a mixture between nodes using SAODV and
   nodes using plain AODV in the same network is possible or desirable.

   N. Asokan (from Nokia Research Center) has contributed to this draft
   with several improvements and corrections. He suggested the use of
   hash chains for authenticate the hop count and, that intermediate
   nodes should sign the lifetime of the RREPs.

   Sampo Sovio (also from Nokia Research Center) discussed with me
   several ways of how to use hashing techniques for SAODV.

   Toni Barrera Arboix gave very valuable orientations about
