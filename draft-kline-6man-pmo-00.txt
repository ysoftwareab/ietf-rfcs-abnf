                        draft-kline-6man-pmo-00

Abstract

   This document describes an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Path MTU
   Option (PMO) for inclusion in Router Advertisements (RAs).  This
   allows some environments greater flexibility to support, for example,
   a higher MTU for on-link or intra-administrative-domain
   communications than for broader Internet communications.

Internet-Draft            IPv6 Path MTU Option                 July 2019


1.  Introduction

   This document describes an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Path MTU
   Option (PMO) for inclusion in Router Advertisements (RAs).  This
   allows some environments greater flexibility to support, for example,
   a higher MTU for on-link or intra-administrative-domain
   communications than for broader Internet communications.

   TBD: Explain why extending RFC4191 RIOs didn't look easy.

   TBD: more discussion

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Summary of key terms

   For the purposes of this document the following terms are used as
   described here.

2.2.1.  Link MTU

   The MTU of the link ([RFC4861]); alternatively, the MTU as it would
   be determined were no Path MTU Option (Section 2.2.5) present.  This
   may be:

      the value specified in an MTU Option (Section 2.2.4),

      a value specified in a separate document that covers operating IP
      over a particular link type (e.g., [RFC2464]), or

      a value derived by other means (e.g. administrative or a hint from
      a sub-IP layer mechanism).

   The Link MTU MUST be the initial Path MTU used when transmitting to
   any link-local destination.

2.2.2.  Path MTU

   TBD: Path MTU

2.2.3.  Path MTU Discovery

   TBD: Path MTU Discovery (cite [RFC8201])

2.2.4.  MTU Option

   The MTU Option is defined in [RFC4861] section 4.6.4.  In this
   documented it may also be referred to as the Link MTU Option, in
   order to disambiguate it from this the Path MTU Option
   (Section 2.2.5).

2.2.5.  Path MTU Option

   The IPv6 ND Path MTU Option is described in this document.  It
   provides more explicit signaling of the best initial Path MTU value
   for a given set of destinations when sending via the advertising
   router.

   Fields:

   Type       TBD

   Length     The length of the option in units of 8 octets.

              When not set, the receiving node MUST NOT make any
              assumptions of exclusive use of the specified Prefix, i.e.
              processing is unchanged from previous standards behavior.

   Option     The contents of the option as described below.
   contents

   The Path MTU Option contents are encoded as a repeated sequence of:

      4-octet MTU value

      1-octet number of prefixes

      sequence of prefixes to which this MTU applies

   where each prefix is encoded as:

      1-octet prefix length

      variable length leading bits of prefix or IP address

   Each sequence of octets representing a prefix uses only as many
   octets as required to by the prefix length (e.g. for a prefix length
   of 0: 0 octets are required, for prefix lengths 1 through 8: 1 octet
   is required, and so on).

   The option is padded with zero-valued octets to the 8 octet boundary
   as given by the option length.

4.  Option Processing Rules

   Nodes compliant with this specification do not change their
   processing of RAs that contain no Path MTU Options.  Additionally,
   for all Path MTU determination, an effective Path MTU learned via a
   Path MTU Discovery mechanism ([RFC8201]) MUST take precedence.

   Any IPv6 link-local prefixes listed within a Path MTU Option MUST be
   ignored by the receiver and SHOULD be logged for review by an
   administrator.

   Any MTU value lower than the IPv6 minimum MTU (i.e. 1280, [RFC8200]
   section 5), SHOULD be logged for administrator review as a

   configuration error and MUST be treated by the receiver as though the
   IPv6 minimum MTU had been the encoded value.

   The Link MTU MUST also be used for all on-link destinations, to
   maintain compatibility with existing behavior and expectations.  For
   the same reason, the Link MTU SHOULD be used for destinations within
   any PIO prefix in the RA, even if the L bit is not set.  As noted in
   [RFC5942], a destination may at some time be learned to be on-link,
   and this information may expire or be changed.

   For all other destinations considered reachable via the option's
   advertising router, an initial Path MTU SHOULD be determined by first
   looking for a prefix that includes the destination in a Path MTU
   Option and using the corresponding MTU value.  If no such prefix
   exists, the Link MTU SHOULD be assumed to be the default.

   Note that as a matter of convenience a Path MTU Option may contain an
   entry for ::/0 even when the router lifetime is zero.  This in no way
   indicates that the router will function as a default gateway.
   Rather, it may be used, for example, to apply a Path MTU to all
   prefixes listed in a set of RIOs.
