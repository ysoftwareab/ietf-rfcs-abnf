Abstract

   FMIPv6 aims to achieve seamless handoff but needs (AP-ID, AR-Info) in
   PARs to function and can't work if PAR doesn't have an entry for the
   next AP.  In this draft, we present a scheme to dynamically build
   (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuple in PAR and make FMIPv6 perform even when PAR
   doesn't have a suitable (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuple by putting LinkID
   prefix in L2 beacon.

1.  Introduction

   FMIPv6 [1] protocol is designed to achieve seamless handoff.  FMIPv6
   relies on (AP-ID, AR-Info) in PARs but doesn't define how it can be
   built.  Also FMIPv6 can't work if PAR doesn't have an entry for the
   next AP.

   In this draft, we present a scheme for PAR to dynamically build
   (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuple, which we call Dynamic NAR Address Discovery.
   With such a scheme, we can make FMIPv6 function even when PAR doesn't
   have a suitable (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuple.

   We propose wireless AP to advertise the LinkID prefix in L2 beacons
   to allow 1) PAR to acquire NAR Address Information similar to Dynamic
   Home Agent Address Discovery [4] and 2) MN to perform FMIPv6
   procedure even when PAR doesn't have the NAR information.

3.  Protocol Overview

   Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery in MIPv6 [4] allows an MN to
   dynamically find out Home Agent address by sending an Home Agent
   Address Discovery Request message to the Mobile IPv6 Home-Agents
   anycast address for its home IP subnet prefix.

   Similarly this draft propose a scheme for a PAR to dynamically find
   out NAR address by sending an NAR Address Discovery Request (NADREQ)
   message to the NAR anycast address for the NAR subnet prefix.  We
   make a wireless AP advertise a suitable NAR subnet prefix to provide
   it to PAR as below.

   Wireless AP (Access Point) such as 802.11 AP (Access Point) puts the
   LinkID Prefix information in its beacon message.

   An MN may scan incoming beacon to retrieve the associated LinkID
   prefix.  With the LinkID Prefix, the MN can perform DNA procedure to
   determine whether the AP belongs to the same link or not.  If the AP
   belong to the same link, the MN can move to it without performing any
   L3 handover procedure.

   Assume the MN receives a LinkID prefix in beacon which belongs to a
   different link.  Then the MN forwards the LinkID prefix to its PAR in
   a RtSolPr message.

   Upon receiving the RtSolPr message, if the PAR has an entry for the
   AP, it follows the standard FMIPv6 procedure to send back PrRtAdv.

   Even in case the PAR doesn't have an entry for the AP, it can get the
   necessary information dynamically in a similar way as Home Agent
   Discovery in [4].  The PAR forms a NAR Anycast Address by combining
   the LinkID prefix it received in RtSolPr and well-known interface
   identifier and sends an NADREQ message to the NAR Anycast Address to
   request NAR information from an NAR.  The NAR which receives the
   NADREQ replies an NADREP with the NAR information.

   When the NADREP arrives, the PAR forwards the NAR information to the
   MN in a PrRtAdv.  Then the MN can perform standard FMIPv6 procedure.

   If the MN needs to move to the new AP before receiving PrRtAdv, it
   forms a new CoA with the LinkID prefix and sends FBU with the NCoA
   and the LinkID prefix.

   Upon receiving it, if it has the suitable NAR information, the PAR
   initiates HI/ HAck exchange in unicast.  If it has none, the PAR
   sends an HI to an NAR anycast address and the NAR that receives the
   HI replies with HAck with a suitable information.  Hence, the MN can

   form an NCoA without PrRtAdv and the PAR can send HI without knowing
   NAR address.

5.  Protocol in Detail

5.1.  DNA with LinkID Prefix in L2 beacon

   A wireless AP such as 802.11 AP may advertise the LinkID prefix in L2
   beacon to facilitate FMIPv6 operation.

   An AP can get a suitable RA as defined in Sec 5.1 'RA Caching' of FRD
   [7] and extract a LinkID Prefix from the RA because the LinkID is
   explicitly advertised in any RA.  Then the AP puts the LinkID prefix
   in its beacon message.

   An MN may scan incoming beacon from the AP to retrieve the LinkID
   prefix associated with the AP, i.e. the LinkID prefix of the link to
   which the AP belongs.

   The MN may perform DNA procedure to determine whether the AP is on
   the same link or not.  Take note that even the AP advertises any
   prefix, the MN can check for link change if it has the Complete
   Prefix List [8]

   If the AP is on the same link, the MN can change its attachment to
   the AP without performing any L3 handoff procedure because the MN can
   keep using the existing IP configuration.  So when MN moves to the AP
   on the same link, it only needs to perform L2 handoff procedure and
   and reduces unnecessary IP signaling messages such as RS/ RA
   messages.

   Also when an MN selects the next AP from multiple candidates, it can
   choose the one on the same link to reduce signaling overhead, in case
   every other condition is the same.

5.2.  Dynamic NAR Address Discovery

   In some cases, Access Routers (specifically PAR) may not have the
   (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuple information for the requested Access Point(s)
   in the RtSolPr.  For each such LinkID in RtSolPr, PAR should perform
   the following procedure to resolve the NAR Address Information of the
   (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuple before sending PrRtAdv.  PAR should not send
   NADREQ again, if it is already in the process of resolving the same
   information.  Following cases should be considered as PAR is
   resolving the information for the given LinkID

   1.  PAR has sent NADREQ to NAR anycast address derived from same
       LinkID and waiting for response.

   2.  PAR has sent HI to NAR anycast address derived from same LinkID
       and waiting for response.

Internet-Draft                     FL                      February 2006


   PAR will form NAR anycast address from LinkID prefix.  It sends NAR
   Address Discovery Request (see Section 4.1.1) to NAR anycast address,
   requesting NAR Address Information.  NAR should send the NAR Address
   Discovery Reply (Section 4.1.2) with its global unicast IP address
   and Link Layer address of the interface for which destination address
   in the NADREQ belongs to, if the NADREQ is valid.

   PAR should retransmit the NADREQ, if it has not received NADREP
   within a time period (no less than twice the typical RTT between
   source and destination, or 100 milliseconds if RTT is not known).
   PAR may retransmit the NADREQ for a maximum of NAD_RETRIES [TBA].
   Retransmissions should follow the exponential backoff algorithm in
   which timeout period is doubled before each retransmission.

   PAR may maintain a timer for each (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuple to
   invalidate the entry after a timeout period.  PAR can start Dynamic
   NAR Address Discovery before the information becomes invalid.

   PAR can optionally include its address information such as IPv6
   address, link layer address and LinkID prefix (if the prefix in IPv6
   address is different) in the NADREQ, so that receiver can store this
   information.

5.3.  FMIPv6 with LinkID Procedures

5.3.1.  MN resolving new subnet information

   As per FMIPv6 [1], MN can discover the neighboring access points
   using link layer mechanisms to resolve the neighboring subnet
   information by exchanging RtSolPr and PrRtAdv with PAR.

   While discovering neighboring Access Points or when MN receives
   beacons from new Access Points, MN compares the LinkID received (if
   it is present) in the beacons from new access points with its current
   LinkID.  If the MN does not have the (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuple for the
   corresponding access point(s), it can send RtSolPr (see Section 4.2.1
   to resolve one or more AP-IDs.

   MN should not include the Access Points that belongs to it's current
   subnet (i.e., LinkID is same) in the RtSolPr.  MN should include the
   LinkIDs in RtSolPr along with AP-IDs, if it receives LinkID in
   beacons.  The LinkID prefix option should be immediately followed by
   corresponding AP-ID option, if it is present.  The format of LinkID
   prefix option is same as the new router prefix information option of
   FMIPv6 [1].

   The exchange and processing of RtSolPr and PrRtAdv between the MN and
   PAR will be as per FMIPv6 [1] except including LinkIDs in RtSolPr and

Internet-Draft                     FL                      February 2006


   PAR performing Dynamic NAR Address Discovery (see Section 5.2), if
   required.

5.3.2.  Binding Procedure

   If the MN has the (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuple before it is going to
   associate with new access point, it should follow the FMIPv6 [1]
   procedures.  Otherwise, if the LinkID is received in the beacons
   advertised by the new access point, MN should follow the following
   procedure.

   MN should form a prospective NCoA using LinkID prefix and send the
   FBU (see Section 4.2.3) along with LinkID in Mobility Header Prefix
   Option (see Section 4.3.1).  MN should process any PrRtAdv received
   after sending FBU.  If the MN receives FBack with NAR Address
   Information, it should store the information.  MN should follow the
   FMIPv6 procedures from this point onwards.  MN can use the LinkID
   prefix information after attaching to new access point, even if the
   FMIPv6 operation fails.

   If the PAR receives FBU with LinkID prefix, PAR should check if it
   has the NAR Address Information corresponding to the LinkID prefix.
   If the PAR has NAR Address Information, PAR should send PrRtAdv to MN
   with NAR Address information and send HI to NAR as per FMIPv6 [1].
   If the PAR does not have NAR Address Information, it should send HI
   to NAR Anycast address formed using LinkID prefix.

   If NAR receives HI destined to its anycast address, it should include
   NAR Address Information in the response (see Section 4.2.2).  After
   receiving HAck with NAR Address Information, PAR will store that
   information and send FBack (see Section 4.2.4) to MN (both PCoA and
   NCoA) with NAR Address Information by including MH IP Address Option
   (See Section TBF) and MH Link Layer Address Option (See RFC 4068
   [1]).  NAR should ignore HAck without NAR Address Information
   received in response to HI sent to NAR anycast address.

   Retransmissions of HI should be as per FMIPv6 [1].  PAR should not
   send any PrRtAdv to MN after sending HI to NAR unless MN solicits
   again.
