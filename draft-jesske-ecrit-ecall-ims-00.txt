         eCall requirements for IMS backwardcompatible solution
                    draft-jesske-ecrit-ecall-ims-00

Abstract

   This document discusses the requirements for a backward compatible
   solution to address eCall / emergency call requirements of carriers
   using the IMS.

1.  Overall Applicability

   Uniform Resource Name (URN) for emergency and other Well-Known
   Services are well defined within RFC5031 [2].  There are also
   existing proposals for automatic and manual ecall IN-Vehicles which
   defines their own URN's and additional procedures for vehicle
   specific eCalls.  Due to the existing telecommunication world and
   their implementations a combination of both is needed.  Specific the
   IMS (IP Multimedia Subsytem) of 3GPP nees an implementation which is
   backwardscompatible.  Due to the fact that only one URN can be used
   within the request line of a SIP Message a new approach is needed.
   Therefore this documentdiscusses the requirement to address a
   routingpossibility for a eCall.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].

3.  Overview

   RFC5031 [2] defines URN values for emergency calls.  The values for
   the SOS subtree are sos.ambulance, sos.animal-control, sos.fire,
   sos.gas, sos.marine, sos.mountain , sos.physician, sos.poison and
   sos.police draft-ietf-ecrit-ecall-01.txt [3] proposes two additional
   URN for ecall. automatic and ecall.manual the sub-services 'sos' as
   specified in Section 4.2 of RFC5031 [2].

   Within the existing implementation in GSM networks for emergency call
   as specified in 3GPP TS 22.101 [4] the following requirements and
   code points are described:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Internet-DrafeCall requirements for IMS backwardcompatible  October 2014


   It shall be possible to initiate emergency calls to different
   emergency call centers, depending on the type of emergency.  The
   following types of emergency calls shall be possible:

   o Police

   o Ambulance

   o Fire Brigade

   o Marine Guard

   o Mountain Rescue

   o Manually Initiated eCall

   o Automatically Initiated eCall

   ....

   It shall be possible to tie any emergency call number to any single
   emergency call type or to any combination of emergency call types.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   This means in practice that a emergency Call Center from police must
   differentiate between automatic and manual eCalls.  Same belongs to
   the other types like fire brigade Marine Guard ect.

   Requirement:

   Req-1: It shall be possible to tie a manually initiated eCall with
   different type of emergency type i.e.  Police, Ambulance, Fire
   Brigade, Marine Guard and Mountain Rescue.

   Req-2:It shall be possible to tie a automatically initiated eCallC
   with different type of emergency type i.e.  Police, Ambulance, Fire
   Brigade, Marine Guard and Mountain Rescue.

   These requirements will not allow a second different URN Format as
   described in draft-ietf-ecrit-ecall-01.txt [3] . This draft adds two
   additional URN urn:service:sos.ecall.manual and
   urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic Which allows to address the ecall
   itself.  But the requirement in 3GPP TS 22.101 [4] described will not
   be satisfied.  Therefor this document only describes the
   requirements.

   Thus a mechanism is needed to tie any emergency call number to any
   single emergency call type or to any combination of emergency call
   types.

4.  IANA Consideration

   Currently no consideration required.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise security considerations beyond those
   described in RFC5031 [2].

6.  Contributors and Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Dieter Jacobsohn, Maik Kirsch and
   Thomas Dennert for clarifying the requirements on automatic and
   manual eCall in the existing GSM world.
