1.  Introduction

   The scope of this document is to analyse security threats concerning
   a P2PSIP overlay architecture as described in the concepts and
   terminology for Peer-to-Peer SIP (P2PSIP) document [1] and list
   security requirements for the architecture and its components.  This
   document does not intend to propose solutions to overcome security
   threats, but it is more intended to list the security requirements
   that must be addressed in P2PSIP specifications.  This document
   complements the P2PSIP Protocol Framework and Requirements document
   [3].

2.  Definitions

   This section defines a number of concepts that are key to understand
   the rest of the document.

2.1.  General

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

2.2.  P2PSIP network entity

   A P2PSIP network entity is a peer, client, or other functional node
   that may become a part of a P2PSIP overlay.

2.3.  P2PSIP system

   A P2PSIP system consists of the P2PSIP overlay as defined in [1] and
   one or more enrolment servers.  The enrolment servers issue unique
   identities and credentials that are used to authenticate and admit
   P2PSIP network entities to the overlay and allow a user to use
   services provided by the P2PSIP overlay.  The enrolment server may
   also provide an initial set of bootstrap nodes.

3.  Security threats

   This section analyses security threats in the Peer-to-Peer SIP
   architecture.

3.1.  Replay Attacks

   Replay attacks are a form of network attacks where a valid data
   transmission is repeated or delayed.  A badly behaving node may take
   an older message sent by another node, resend it to the overlay, and
   thus replace any newer data with the old information present in this
   message.  During those procedures, an attacker may be able to enroll
   credentials for himself, or replace existing entry in the P2PSIP
   overlay by an older entry.  Thus, the architecture must consider this
   issue in the process of both enrollment and modification of P2PSIP
   resource (user) records in a P2PSIP overlay.

   This is especially applicable to P2PSIP overlays that use the
   recursive routing style.  In the recursive routing style, data sent
   in a PUT request traverses many peers in the overlay.  If there is no
   protection against the replay attacks any peer that forwards the
   request may store a copy of the request and resend the captured
   request corrupting data stored in the overlay.

3.2.  Message Insertion, Modification, Deletion

   The message insertion, modification, and deletion attacks are where
   an attacker is able to alter the messages being exchanged between two
   end points.

   P2PSIP peers connect to other peers to form the P2PSIP overlay
   network.  Typically peers provide storage, routing and bootstrap
   services for other peers and clients.  They allow P2PSIP entities to
   PUT information to or GET information from the P2PSIP overlay
   network.  In the P2PSIP overlay that allows for a recursive routing,
   peers are responsible for forwarding messages (requests and
   responses) received from P2PSIP network entities to other peers.
   Depending on the size of the overlay a single message can be
   forwarded by many peers before it reaches a destination.  In the
   iterative routing peers are responsible for redirecting the requests
   to other peers.  They do not forward the requests to other peers.
   They respond to a request originator with an address of a peer that
   should be contacted in the next step.  In such an environment a badly
   behaving peer may:

   o  modify incoming messages,





Matuszewski, et al.       Expires May 22, 2008                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP       November 2007


   o  discard incoming messages (the peer can discard requests and
      responses it is supposed to forward),

   o  generate incorrect responses to requests that are directed to some
      other nodes.

   The first bullet point describes the attack that allows the peer to
   cause the overlay to store unauthorized or outdated information in
   the resource (user) records or return corrupted data to the
   originator of the GET request (a peer or client).  The peer may
   change the data record in the overlay by changing incoming PUT
   messages or modify result of the GET operation by modifying incoming
   GET responses.  With this type of attack the integrity of the P2PSIP
   system can become compromised.

   The middle bullet point is related not only to attacks that allow a
   malicious peer to prevent access to a P2PSIP resource (user) record,
   but also to attacks that can degrade the performance of the P2PSIP
   system making it useless from the end-user perspective.  The second
   problem is of high importance in P2PSIP overlays that store user's
   reachability data which is much more time-critical than content
   stored in file sharing networks.

   The attack described in the last bullet above may lead to a requestor
   receiving corrupted data e.g. a connectivity information that points
   to some other node.  This may happen if a malicious peer can respond
   to incoming requests that are directed to another peer.

   Besides peers may act as relays relaying traffic between two P2PSIP
   network entities or act as a SIP proxy and a SIP registrar.
   Providing those services a malicious peer may perform a similar
   attacks as described above.  Let us consider the following deployment
   scenario where some peers act as SIP registrars or/and SIP proxies
   and allow a conventional SIP UA to access resources of the P2PSIP
   overlay network.  An unmodified SIP UA sends an SIP Invite request
   towards an unknown peer that acts as a SIP proxy.  If the SIP
   messages are not cryptographically protected, this peer may act
   maliciously and proxy a request to other than intended node or modify
   SDP messages in order to stay on the media path.  Similarly a peer
   that acts as a SIP Registrar may modify registration information
   before it sends it to a peer that is responsible for storing the
   P2PSIP user record of a registering SIP UA.  Those attacks do not
   have impact on the integrity of the overlay.  Nevertheless those
   attacks must be addressed by designers of service specific protocols
   such as SIP [4].

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP       November 2007


3.3.  Man-In-The-Middle

   In man-in-the-middle (m-i-m) attacks a malicious node can hijack a
   connection established between two legitimate nodes, or just listen
   and/or modify messages exchanged between two nodes.  In contrast to
   the attacks presented in Section 3.2 man-in-the middle attacks are
   prevalent in pairing and authentication procedures.

   The m-i-m threat can be mitigated by using well-established
   authentication protocols.  The authentication protocols may be used
   to verify if a certain P2PSIP entity is the entity it claims to be,
   for example if it is really a peer that is identified by a certain
   peer ID.  The authentication protocols can also be used to verify if
   a particular P2PSIP entity belongs to a particular overlay or not.
   However, authentication protocols cannot fully mitigate all of the
   attacks presented in Section 3.2.  There can be malicious peers that
   are authorised overlay participants with a particular peer
   identifiers.

   If a bootstrap process is fully decentralised and a bootstrap node is
   not trusted or authentication of the bootstrap node is not possible,
   then the joining node can easily be attacked, e.g. it may be
   redirected to another overlay or a part of the legacy overlay that is
   controlled by the attacker.  However if it is possible to
   authenticate a particular peer in the overlay the joining peer may
   use P2P specific mechanisms to detect if it is redirected to the
   right overlay or the right place in the overlay.

   Conventional SIP proxy and SIP registrars are servers maintained by a
   service provider.  If a user trust a service provider he also trusts
   servers the service provider maintains.  In P2PSIP SIP proxies and
   registrars can be maintained by users themselves (they can be
   collocated with peers).  In a distributed environment it is very
   difficult to trust all of peers in the overlay.  Without an efficient
   verification mechanism that allows to verify which peers are be
   trusted, peers that act as SIP proxies and registrars may easily
   perform m-i-m attacks.  The problem must be solved by SIP designers
   as well as by the P2PSIP community.

3.4.  Offline Cryptographic Attacks

   The incentive to break a secure system dominates the effort to do so.
   It is likely that P2PSIP systems do not pose a likely target for
   attacks, and if state-of-the art security methods are used, the
   needed effort to break the system by breaking cryptography is very
   likely to be higher than by finding and exploiting software errors
   and vulnerabilities.

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP       November 2007


3.5.  Unauthorized Usage

   The basic notions of authentication and authorization, when
   implemented correctly and consistently SHOULD protect against
   unauthorized usage of the P2PSIP system.  However, the
   trustworthiness of an identity may be weak i.e. the enrollment system
   might be fairly open and allow devices and persons that wish to
   attack the system.  Thus, there is a significant threat of attacks
   from within the system.

   A malicious peer may do a multitude of attacks towards the overlay
   including:

   o  ignoring, changing, and deleting records in DHT that is it
      responsible for,

   o  misbehaving during data lookups (ie, giving wrong node addresses,
      discarding queries).

   The first bullet point is related to attacks that may cause DHT to
   contain unauthorized, outdated information and/or miss information
   about users or resources.  Each peer is responsible for a part of the
   hash space.  Peers store resource (user) records that fall into their
   part of the hash space.  A malicious peer may modify or delete
   resource (user) records it is supposed to store.  It may also reply
   with incorrect information to the GET requests addressed to resource
   (user) records it is responsible for.  In addition it may ignore any
   record updates.  These attacks are not limited to peers that are
   responsible for primary copies of resource (user) records.  They are
   also related to peers that store replicas of resource (user) records.
   Besides a bootstrap node may also respond with wrong bootstraping
   information.

   The second bullet point addresses attacks that may impact correctness
   of routing mechanisms.  If the recoursive routing is used a malicious
   peer can forward messages to another malicious node rather than
   forwarding the messages according to the legitimate routing
   information.  This may also impact the iterative routing being
   corrupted when the peer redirects the requester to a malicious node.

3.6.  Inappropriate Usage

   The P2PSIP essentially provides a distributed storage for P2PSIP
   resource (user) records.  The data stored in the distributed database
   can be used in an inappropriate manner.  If there is no access
   control to a resource (user) records stored in the overlay and any
   node can update or retrieve information stored in the overlay.  An
   attacker may request data stored in the P2PSIP resource (user)



Matuszewski, et al.       Expires May 22, 2008                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP       November 2007


   records and perform inappropriate usage attacks.  Besides the
   attacker may also update entries of other users or resources.

   The individual services provided by P2PSIP (messaging, real-time
   communication) have their respective threat models regarding
   inappropriate use (Spam, viruses, ...) but these can be considered
   out of scope for this document.

3.7.  Denial of Service

   In the P2PSIP architecture [1], the P2PSIP resource (user) records
   are not maintained in a central, trustworthy storage system, rather
   they are distributed among peers participating in the system.
   Routing, relaying, SIP proxy and registrar services are also
   distributed among P2PSIP entities.  In cases where authentication in
   the P2PSIP overlay is weak or where the system is fairly open to new
   participants the "infiltration" is trivial (e.g., Sybil attack).

   If peers in the P2PSIP overlay can freely choose peer IDs or/and
   easily modify previously selected peer IDs the attacker may use join-
   leave attacks to place a malicious peer intentionally at any location
   in overlay.  Placing the peer at any location allows an attacker to
   obtain control of the location in the overlay where the attacked user
   or resource is registered.  A malicious peer may discard, modify the
   data it is supposed to store and may discard lookup requests or reply
   with incorrect entries to the incoming requests.

   The attacker may also try to register a large number of resources to
   the P2PSIP overlay increasing processing load on peers that are
   responsible for storing the resources and limiting the overall
   capacity of the P2PSIP overlay network.  It may also try to register
   all popular names preventing the name holders from registering their
   preferred URIs.

   Another critical point where a D-o-S attack can be mounted is the
   enrollment system.

3.8.  Communication security threats

   The main places where communication security becomes an issue in the
   P2PSIP context is the enrollment process and the communication
   between endpoints.  The last ones are subject to all typical threats
   in this domain, however they have been individually considered in the
   earlier sections of this chapter.

   This document assumes that the actual SIP service implementation

4.  Security requirements

   This section describes requirements related to the security of a
   P2PSIP system.  We divided the requirements into user requirements
   and system requirements.

4.1.  User requirements

   The user wants available and reliable service that enables him to
   interact with other users and resources in a secure way.  This means
   that the P2PSIP system MUST provide:

   o  lookup and discovery of users and resources that is secure and
      reliable,

   o  certainty of user and resource identity,

   o  confidentiality and integrity of end-to-end multimedia
      communication,

   o  easy and secure enrolment to the P2PSIP system,

   o  privacy.

4.2.  System requirements

   In order for a P2PSIP system to function properly and that the end
   user gets a proper service, there are several aspects that the P2PSIP
   system must take in to account.

4.2.1.  Dependence of reachability of a centralized server

   Considering the nature of P2P in general, the dependence of
   reachability of a centralized server SHOULD be minimized.  There may
   be unavoidable situations such as the enrollment process, where this
   is not possible.  However, the normal functioning of the P2PSIP
   overlay such as join and leave operations, modification, retrieval
   and deletion of P2PSIP resource (user) records from the P2PSIP system
   should not depend on the reachability of a centralised server.

4.2.2.  Scalability

   P2PSIP security SHOULD scale from a small ad-hoc network to a network
   with hundred millions of network nodes and users.

4.2.3.  Preference of existing security mechanisms

   Although P2PSIP defines a new architecture, and thereby new
   interfaces and protocols, for security there are several standardized
   solutions for access control, authentication, integrity protection
   and communication security.  Using established protocols minimizes
   potential security loopholes that need to be patched later.  Besides
   implementation is easer if chosen security protocols are widely
   implemented and used.

4.2.4.  Requirements on a base P2P algorithm

   All of security operations should be specified in such a way that
   they do not impose new unnecessary requirements on a base P2P
   algorithm (e.g., DHT implementations) and limit its scalability.

4.2.5.  Node and user identification

   The P2PSIP system MUST preserve user and resource identities.  It
   MUST NOT be possible to steal a P2PSIP identity from another user.

   Because some attackers may try to use identities of another P2PSIP
   network entities it must be possible to verify the identity of
   another party.

4.2.6.  Enrollment

   The ease for users to enroll to a P2PSIP system SHOULD be ensured as
   said in the section 4.1.  The enrollment process defines the set of
   users and P2PSIP network entities that may participate in a P2PSIP
   system and issues them credentials.  This process is defined by the
   P2PSIP system, and the policy who can participate to is done during
   this process.  The enrolment process policy may define:

   o  how many and what user IDs and peer IDs an user or a P2PSIP
      network entity may register,

   o  whether users are charged for the usage of the P2PSIP system,

   o  and how often they must re-new their subscription to the P2PSIP
      system.

   As it was indicated in [3] the enrollment process may take several
   measures in admitting a user or a network node to the P2PSIP system,
   for example:

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP       November 2007


   o  may require strong identity such as employment or identity
      provided by a trusted 3rd party or by the P2PSIP service operator,

   o  may charge for the enrollment,

   o  may apply reputation mechanisms.

   Although the user probably is the entity that enrolls to the P2PSIP
   system, the credentials that are the result of the enrollment are
   used to grant a device the right to function as a peer, client or any
   other operative function possible in the system.  Thus the security
   of enrollment also translates to the security of the device itself
   where the credentials are stored, and threats related to device
   security in general.

4.2.7.  Replay attacks

   An attacker should not be able to repeat or delay valid data
   transmission during enrollment and modification of P2PSIP resource
   (user) records in a P2PSIP overlay.

4.2.8.  Data access

   An attacker MUST NOT be able to easily corrupt, delete, or overwrite
   other user's or resource's data stored in P2PSIP resource (user)
   records as well as routing tables.  Only authorized users MUST be
   able to modify, delete or overwrite their P2PSIP resource (user)
   records in the P2PSIP system.  P2PSIP security should allow users and
   P2PSIP network entities to register the same resources (e.g.
   TURN@overlay.net), however each entity should have rights only to its
   own part of a resource record.  In other words each entity should be
   able to perform the same operations on its part of a resource record
   as on its own resource (user) records.

   The owner of the P2PSIP resource (user) records SHOULD be able to
   authorize other users and network entities to modify, delete their
   P2PSIP resource (user) records.

4.2.9.  Data validation

   First and foremost it MUST be possible to verify that the data stored
   in or retrieved from the P2PSIP overlay is authentic, i.e. was not
   tampered by unauthorized P2PSIP network entities.

   The peer that stores P2PSIP resource (user) records MUST be able to
   validate the data received in the process of P2PSIP resource (user)
   record insertion and modification.

4.2.10.  Denial of Service (DOS) attacks

   It MUST NOT be possible to obtain control of the location in the
   overlay where the attacked user's or resource's records are
   registered.  In order to prevent so-called Sybil or join-leave
   attacks the attacker SHOULD NOT be able to easily register a
   unlimited number of IDs of his choice in the P2SIP overlay.  The
   P2PSIP system SHOULD be able to control ID assignment.  Once
   assigned, an ID or a set of IDs SHOULD be difficult to change.

   In addition the P2PSIP architecture SHOULD make sure that data stored
   in a P2PSIP overlay is persistent, meaning that even if a number of
   nodes (but not all of nodes in the overlay) fails the data stored by
   those nodes is not lost.  In addition the attacker MUST NOT be able
   to register unlimited number of resources in the overlay.

4.2.11.  Privacy

   The security of P2PSIP systems MUST guarantee privacy of the P2PSIP
   network participants.  The P2PSIP security SHOULD allow the users and
   P2PSIP network entities to indicate which other users or P2PSIP
   network entities can retrieve, modify, and delete data stored in
   their P2PSIP resource (user) records.  The owner of a P2PSIP resource
   (user) record SHOULD be able to limit the access to his own resource
   (user) records, and this feature should be enforced by the P2P
   network.

   It MUST also be difficult to monitor who is communicating with a
   particular user, or retreive any contextual data about the user
   without the user's explicit consent.  The P2PSIP network entities
   MUST be provided with option to encrypt data exchanged with other
   P2PSIP network entities.

4.2.12.  Detection and rejection of badly behaving nodes

   It SHOULD be possible to limit potential damage caused by
   malfunctioning and badly behaving nodes in a P2PSIP system.  As the
   policy taken by the P2PSIP system operator/community may be very
   liberal, any user can obtain the right to be a user of a P2PSIP
   system.  It may be that some users behave badly intentionally in
   which case it should be possible limit the impact of the badly
   behaving nodes on the overall system security.  It SHOULD be possible
   to identify badly behaving nodes, and exclude or reject them from the
   P2PSIP system.

4.2.13.  Summary of the system requirements

   P2PSIP system requirements related to security issues are summarized
   below:

   Req. 1: Dependence of reachability of a centralized server SHOULD be
   minimized.

   Req. 2: P2PSIP security SHOULD scale from a small ad-hoc network to a
   network with hundred millions of network nodes and users.

   Req. 3: Existing security mechanisms SHOULD be used as much as
   possible to protect P2PSIP functions, and avoid the need for
   standardizing new mechanisms.

   Req. 4: Security requirements on the base P2P algorithm (e.g., DHT
   implementations) used in P2PSIP SHOULD be minimized and SHOULD NOT
   limit its scalability.

   Req. 5: The registered identities in a P2PSIP overlay MUST be
   preserved.  The attacker MUST NOT be able to steal identity from
   another user.

   Req. 6: The enrollment process MUST make it difficult for an attacker
   to register many identities in a P2PSIP overlay and easily modify the
   registered identities.

   Req. 7: It MUST be difficult to select a particular peer ID e.g. peer
   ID assignment process should introduce some degree of randomness to
   peer identities.

   Req. 8: It MUST be possible to authenticate users and P2PSIP network
   entities.

   Req. 9: It MUST NOT be possible to repeat or delay valid data
   transmission during enrollment and modification of P2PSIP resource
   (user) records.

   Req. 10: The P2PSIP security MUST support integrity protection of the
   data being inserted or retrieved to/from an overlay.

   Req. 11: The P2PSIP network entities MUST be provided with an option
   to encrypt data exchanged with other P2PSIP network entities.

   Req. 12: Only authorized users and P2PSIP network entities MUST be
   able to join the P2PSIP system and insert, modify, delete or
   overwrite P2PSIP resource (user) records in the P2PSIP system.

   Req. 13: In the situations where many users or P2PSIP network
   entities register the same resource in the P2PSIP overlay, each
   entity MUST have rights only to its own part of a resource record.

   Req. 14: An owner of P2PSIP resource (user) record MAY indicate which
   users or network entities can retrieve, modify, and delete data
   stored in their P2PSIP resource (user) records.

   Req. 15: P2PSIP overlay protocols MUST be designed such a way so that
   the effect of DOS attacks on the P2PSIP overlay is minimized.

   Req. 16: It SHOULD be possible to limit the impact of badly behaving
   P2PSIP nodes on the overall system security.  There SHOULD be an
   option to identify malfunctioning or badly behaving nodes, and
   exclude or reject them from the P2PSIP system.
