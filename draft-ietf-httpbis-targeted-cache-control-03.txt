                      Targeted HTTP Cache Control
              draft-ietf-httpbis-targeted-cache-control-03

Abstract

   This specification defines a convention for HTTP response header
   fields that allow cache directives to be targeted at specific caches
   or classes of caches.  It also defines one such header field,
   targeted at Content Delivery Network (CDN) caches.

1.  Introduction

   Modern deployments of HTTP often use multiple layers of caching.  For
   example, a Web site might use a cache on the origin server itself; it
   might deploy a caching layer in the same network as the origin
   server, it might use one or more Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
   that are distributed throughout the Internet, and it might utilise
   browser caching as well.

Internet-Draft         Targeted HTTP Cache Control          January 2022


   Because it is often desirable to control these different classes of
   caches separately, some means of targeting directives at them is
   necessary.

   The HTTP Cache-Control response header field (defined in Section 5.2
   of [HTTP-CACHING]) is widely used to direct caching behavior.
   However, it is relatively undifferentiated; while some directives
   (e.g., s-maxage) are targeted at a specific class of caches (for
   s-maxage, shared caches), targeting is not consistently available
   across all existing cache directives (e.g., stale-while-revalidate).
   This is problematic, especially as the number of caching extensions
   grows, along with the number of potential targets.

   Some implementations have defined ad hoc control mechanisms to
   overcome this issue, but their interoperability is low.  Section 2
   defines a standard framework for targeted cache control using HTTP
   response headers, and Section 3 defines one such header: the CDN-
   Cache-Control response header field.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Targeted Cache-Control Header Fields

   A Targeted Cache-Control Header Field (hereafter, "targeted field")
   is a HTTP response header field that has the same semantics as the
   Cache-Control response header field ([HTTP-CACHING], Section 5.2).
   However, it has a distinct field name that indicates the target for
   its directives.

   For example:

   CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=60

   is a targeted field that applies to Content Delivery Networks (CDNs),
   as defined in Section 3.

Internet-Draft         Targeted HTTP Cache Control          January 2022


2.1.  Syntax

   Targeted fields are Dictionary Structured Fields (Section 3.2 of
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]).  Each member of the dictionary is a cache
   response directive from the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Cache
   Directive Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-cache-
   directives/).  Note that while targeted fields often have the same
   syntax as Cache-Control fields, differences in error handling mean
   that using a Cache-Control parser rather than a Structured Fields
   parser can introduce interoperability issues.

   Because cache directives are not defined in terms of structured data
   types, it is necessary to map their values into the appropriate
   types.  Section 5.2 of [HTTP-CACHING] defines cache directive values
   to be either absent, a quoted-string, or a token.

   This means that cache directives that have no value will be mapped to
   a Boolean (Section 3.3.6 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]).  When the value is
   a quoted-string, it will be mapped to a String (Section 3.3.3 of
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]), and when it is a token, it will map to a Token
   (Section 3.3.4 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]), an Integer (Section 3.3.1 of
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]) or a Decimal (Section 3.3.2 of
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]), depending on the content of the value.

   For example, the max-age directive (Section 5.2.2.1 of
   [HTTP-CACHING]) has an integer value; no-store (Section 5.2.2.5 of
   [HTTP-CACHING]) always has a boolean true value, and no-cache
   (Section 5.2.2.4 of [HTTP-CACHING]) has a value that can either be
   boolean true or a string containing a comma-delimited list of field
   names.

   Implementations MUST NOT generate values that violate these inferred
   constraints on the directive's value.  In particular, string values
   whose first character is not alphabetic or "*" MUST be generated as
   structured Strings, so they are not mistaken for other types.

   Implementations SHOULD NOT consume values that violate these inferred
   constraints.  For example, a consuming implementation were to coerce
   a max-age with a decimal value into an integer would behave
   differently than other implementations, potentially causing
   interoperability issues.

   Parameters received on directives are to be ignored, unless other
   handling is explicitly specified.

Internet-Draft         Targeted HTTP Cache Control          January 2022


   If a targeted field in a given response is empty, or a parsing error
   is encountered, that field MUST be ignored by the cache (i.e., it
   behaves as if the field were not present, likely falling back to
   other cache control mechanisms present).

2.2.  Cache Behavior

   A cache that implements this specification maintains a _target list_
   - an ordered list of the targeted field names that it uses for
   caching policy, with the order reflecting priority from most
   applicable to least.  The target list might be fixed, user-
   configurable, or generated per request, depending upon the
   implementation.

   For example, a CDN cache might support both CDN-Cache-Control and a
   header specific to that CDN, ExampleCDN-Cache-Control, with the
   latter overriding the former.  Its target list would be:

     [ExampleCDN-Cache-Control, CDN-Cache-Control]

   When a cache that implements this specification receives a response
   with one or more of of the header field names on its target list, the
   cache MUST select the first (in target list order) field with a
   valid, non-empty value and use its value to determine the caching
   policy for the response, and MUST ignore the Cache-Control and
   Expires header fields in that response, unless no valid, non-empty
   value is available from the listed header fields.

   Note that this occurs on a response-by-response basis; if no member
   of the cache's target list is present, valid and non-empty, a cache
   falls back to other cache control mechanisms as required by HTTP
   [HTTP-CACHING].

   Targeted fields that are not on a cache's target list MUST NOT change
   that cache's behaviour, and MUST be passed through.

   Caches that use a targeted field MUST implement the semantics of the
   following cache directives:

   *  max-age

   *  must-revalidate

   *  no-store

   *  no-cache

   *  private

Internet-Draft         Targeted HTTP Cache Control          January 2022


   Furthermore, they SHOULD implement other cache directives (including
   extension cache directives) that they support in the Cache-Control
   response header field.

   The semantics and precedence of cache directives in a targeted field
   are the same as those in Cache-Control.  In particular, no-store and
   no-cache make max-age inoperative, and unrecognised extension
   directives are ignored.

2.3.  Interaction with HTTP Freshness

   HTTP caching has a single, end-to-end freshness model defined in
   Section 4.2 of [HTTP-CACHING].  When additional freshness mechanisms
   are only available to some caches along a request path (for example,
   using targeted fields), their interactions need to be carefully
   considered.  In particular, a targeted cache might have longer
   freshness lifetimes available to it than other caches, causing it to
   serve responses that appear to be prematurely (or even immediately)
   stale to them, negatively impacting cache efficiency.

   For example, a response stored by a CDN cache might be served with
   the following headers:

   Age: 1800
   Cache-Control: max-age=600
   CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=3600

   From the CDN's perspective, this response is still fresh after being
   cached for 30 minutes, while from other caches' standpoint, this
   response is already stale.  See [AGE-PENALTY] for more discussion.

   When the targeted cache has a strong coherence mechanism (e.g., the
   origin server has the ability to proactively invalidate cached
   responses), it is often desirable to mitigate these effects.  Some
   techniques seen in deployments include:

   *  Removing the Age header field

   *  Updating the Date header field value to the current time

   *  Updating the Expires header field value to the current time, plus
      any Cache-Control: max-age value

   This specification does not place any specific requirements on
   implementations to mitigate these effects, but definitions of
   targeted fields can do so.

2.4.  Defining Targeted Fields

   A targeted field for a particular class of cache can be defined by
   requesting registration in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   Field Name Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-fields/).

   Registration requests can use this document as the specification
   document, in which case the Comments field should clearly define the
   class of caches that the targeted field applies to.  Alternatively,
   if other documentation for the field has been created, it can be used
   as the specification document.

   By convention, targeted fields have the suffix "-Cache-Control":
   e.g., "ExampleCDN-Cache-Control".  However, this suffix MUST NOT be
   used on its own to identify targeted fields; it is only a convention.

3.  The CDN-Cache-Control Targeted Field

   The CDN-Cache-Control response header field is a targeted field
   (Section 2) that allows origin servers to control the behaviour of
   CDN caches interposed between them and clients, separately from other
   caches that might handle the response.

   It applies to caches that are part of a distributed network that
   operate on behalf of an origin server (commonly called a Content
   Delivery Network or CDN).

   CDN caches that use CDN-Cache-Control will typically forward this
   header so that downstream CDN caches can use it as well.  However,
   they MAY remove it when this is undesirable (for example, when
   configured to do so because it is known not to be used downstream).

3.1.  Examples

   For example, the following header fields would instruct a CDN cache
   (i.e., a cache with a target list of \[CDN-Cache-Control]]) to
   consider the response fresh for 600 seconds, other shared caches for
   120 seconds and any remaining caches for 60 seconds:

   Cache-Control: max-age=60, s-maxage=120
   CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=600

   These header fields would instruct a CDN cache to consider the
   response fresh for 600 seconds, while all other caches would be
   prevented from storing it:

   CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=600
   Cache-Control: no-store

Internet-Draft         Targeted HTTP Cache Control          January 2022


   Because CDN-Cache-Control is not present, this header field would
   prevent all caches from storing the response:

   Cache-Control: no-store

   Whereas these would prevent all caches except for CDN caches from
   storing the response:

   Cache-Control: no-store
   CDN-Cache-Control: none

   (note that 'none' is not a registered cache directive; it is here to
   avoid sending a header field with an empty value, which would be
   ignored)

4.  IANA Considerations

   Please register the following entry in the Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP) Field Name Registry defined by [HTTP]:

   *  Field Name: CDN-Cache-Control

   *  Status: permanent

   *  Specification Document: [this document]

   *  Comments: Cache-Control directives targeted at Content Delivery
      Networks

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of HTTP caching [HTTP-CACHING] apply.

   The ability to carry multiple caching policies on a response can
   result in confusion about how a response will be cached in different
   systems, if not used carefully.  This might result in unintentional
   reuse of responses with sensitive information.
