                 TCP Fails To Respect IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU
                draft-andrews-tcp-and-ipv6-use-minmtu-04

Abstract

   The IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU socket option directs the IP layer to limit the
   IPv6 packet size to the minimum required supported MTU from the base
   IPv6 specification, i.e. 1280 bytes.  Many implementations of TCP
   running over IPv6 neglect to check the IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU value when
   performing MSS negotiation and when constructing a TCP segment
   despite MSS being defined to be the MTU less the IP and TCP header
   sizes (60 bytes for IPv6).  This leads to oversized IPv6 packets
   being sent resulting in unintended Path Maximum Transport Unit
   Discovery (PMTUD) being performed and to fragmented IPv6 packets
   being sent.

1.  Introduction

   The IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU [RFC3542], Section 11.1, socket option directs
   the IP layer to limit the IPv6 packet size to the minimum required
   supported MTU from the base IPv6 specification [RFC2460], i.e.  1280
   bytes.  Many implementations of TCP running over IPv6 neglect to
   check the IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU value when performing MSS negotiation and
   when constructing a TCP segment despite MSS being defined to be the
   MTU less the IP and TCP header sizes [RFC0879] (60 bytes for IPv6).
   This leads to oversized IPv6 packets being sent resulting in
   unintended Path Maximum Transport Unit Discovery (PMTUD) [RFC1191]
   being performed and to fragmented IPv6 packets being sent.

   TCP, when running over IPv6, SHOULD check the value of
   IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU when performing MSS negotiation.  TCP
   implementations already use learnt PMTU and interface MTU when
   performing MSS negotiation.  This is yet another constraint on the
   MTU which SHOULD be considered.

   TCP, when running over IPv6, SHOULD check the value of
   IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU when calculating the segment size to send.  TCP
   implementations already use learnt PMTU and interface MTU when
   calculating the segment size to send.

2.  MSS Negotiation

   TCP, when running over IPv6, SHOULD check the value of
   IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU when performing MSS negotiation.  If the value of
   IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU is one (1) then the application has requested that
   PMTUD not be performed on the socket and that IPv6 packets be sent at
   a size no greater then the network minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.  This
   means that the TCP MSS negotiation size SHOULD be no bigger than 1220
   (1280 - 40 - 20) to account for the IPv6 header and the TCP header
   and MAY be smaller.

   If this negotiation is properly performed then PMTUD of reply traffic
   should not normally occur.

3.  Segment Size Calculation

   TCP, when running over IPv6, SHOULD check the value of
   IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU when calculation the next segment to send.  If the
   value of IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU is one (1) them the maximum segment size
   SHOULD be 1220.

   If the TCP layer neglects to check the value of IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU and
   it is one (1), the packet, when passed to the IPv6 layer, will be
   fragmented if the resulting packet is bigger that 1280 octets.  This
   can result in communications failures due to intermediate nodes not
   passing fragmented packets.

4.  Current Usage

   A example of current usage of IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU=1 and TCP is in DNS
   nameservers.  This is done as the TCP message streams are normally no
   more than a couple of IPv6 packets so there is little benefit in
   using maximum sized packet, and no real negative effects from using
   smaller packets.  There are lots of servers / clients that these
   servers talk to and maintaining PMTU knowledge is not effective for
   long enough resulting in PMTUD being repeated performed.  There are
   external time constraints where recovery from lost ICMPv6 PTB will
   result in a elapsed transaction time that falls outside of the time
   constraint window.

5.  Acknowledgements

   I would like to thank Havard Eidnes, Sander Steffann, John Leslie,
   and Brian E Carpenter for their feedback.

6.  Security Considerations

   The document makes no changes that could impact on the security of a
   IPv6 stack.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no actions for IANA.
