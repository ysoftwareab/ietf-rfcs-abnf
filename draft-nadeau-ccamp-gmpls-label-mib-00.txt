Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the
   Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network
   management protocols in the Internet community.  In
   particular, it describes managed objects for Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] and Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [GMPLSArch] Label
   Switched Routers (LSRs).

2. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information
   Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes
   managed objects for modeling and managing labels within
   Generalized MPLS systems.  For an introduction to the
   concepts of GMPLS, see [GMPLSArch].  Note that this
   portion of the MIB is optional within a managed GMPLS
   system.  In particular, if the labels used within the
   system are 'simple' labels that may be encoded within a
   32 bit quantity, and if the encoding of the labels is
   implicit from the context within which they are used,
   then the table defined within this MIB is not required.
   Refer to the other MIB definitions ([GMPLSTEMIB] and
   [GMPLSLSRMIB]) for further details.

   Comments should be made directly to the CCAMP mailing
   list at ccamp@ops.ietf.org.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
   "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC 2119, reference
   [RFC2119].


3. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:

   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571
      [RFC2571].

   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and
      events for the purpose of management.  The first
      version of this Structure of Management Information
      (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC
      1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and STD 16,
      RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2,
      is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58,
      RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   -  Message protocols for transferring management
      information.  The first version of the SNMP message
      protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
      1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
      [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version
      of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described
      in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574
      [RFC2574].

draft-nadeau-ccamp-gmpls-label-00.txt                     November 2001

   -  Protocol operations for accessing management
      information.  The first set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC
      1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol operations
      and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [RFC1905].

   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC
      2573 [RFC2573] and the view-based access control
      mechanism described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP
   Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
   SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced
   through the appropriate translations.  The resulting
   translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except
   where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into
   textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation
   process.  However, this loss of machine readable
   information is not considered to change the semantics of
   the MIB.


4. Brief Description of MIB Objects

   The tables support both manually configured and signaled
   tunnels as described in [TBD].


4.1.  gmplsLabelTable

   The gmplsLabelTable allows Generalized Labels to be
   defined and managed in a central location.  Generalized
   Labels can be of variable length and have distinct bit-by-
   bit interpretations according to the use that is made of
   them.

   It is useful to configure and inspect Generalized Labels
   using the sub-fields of the labels - and this table makes
   that feature possible.  At the same time, some labels may
   be of unknown construction and must be exposed as octet
   strings.  Similarly, some implementations may choose not
   to expose the construction of some or all labels, and can
   show them as octet strings.




Nadeau, et al.                                                [Page 4 ]

draft-nadeau-ccamp-gmpls-label-00.txt                     November 2001

   It is possible that some implementations will choose to
   construct and fully populate this table with all valid
   labels at start of day.  Other implementations may choose
   to create entries on-demand.  This table is indexed using
   an arbitrary index value that is not related to the label
   value in use.  This means that it is possible to create
   two row entries with the same label values.  This may be
   convenient when creating table entries on-demand.


4.1.1 Concatenated Labels

   In some environments such as TDM, it is useful to be able
   to build a single GMPLS label from a concatenation of sub-
   labels.  This facilitates, for example, concatenation of
   timeslots to support a data flow.

   This concatenation is achieved through a secondary index
   into the Label Table.

6. Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this
   MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or
   read-create. Such objects may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments. The support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network
   operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that
   may contain information that may be sensitive from a
   business perspective, in that they represent a customer's
   interface to the GMPLS network.  Allowing uncontrolled
   access to these objects could result in malicious and
   unwanted disruptions of network traffic or incorrect
   configurations for these customers.  There are no objects
   that are particularly sensitive in their own right, such
   as passwords or monetary amounts.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these
   objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   object when sending them over the network via SNMP. Not
   all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure
   environment.

   At this writing, no security holes have been identified
   beyond those that SNMP Security [RFC2571] is itself
   intended to address.  These relate to primarily
   controlled access to sensitive information and the
   ability to configure a device - or which might result
   from operator error, which is beyond the scope of any
   security architecture.

   SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 are by themselves not a secure
   environment. Even if the network itself is secure (for
   example by using IPSec [IPSEC]), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB. It is recommended that the implementers consider the
   security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
   Specifically, the use of the User-based Security Model
   [RFC2574] and the View-based Access Control [RFC2575] is
   recommended. It is then a customer/user responsibility to
   ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance
   of this MIB is properly configured to give access to the
   objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that
   may contain information that may be sensitive from a
   business perspective, in that they represent a customer's
   interface to the GMPLS network. Allowing uncontrolled
   access to these objects could result in malicious and
   unwanted disruptions of network traffic or incorrect

   configurations for these customers. There are no objects
   that are particularly sensitive in their own right, such
   as passwords or monetary amounts.
