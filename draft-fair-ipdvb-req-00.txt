        Abstract 
         
        This document contains requirements for a framework for transport of 
        IP Datagrams over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). The MPEG-2 TS 
        has been widely accepted not only for providing digital TV services, 
        but also as a subnetwork technology for building IP networks. One 
        example is the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB), specified by standards 
        published by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute 
        (ETSI).  
         
        The document identifies the need for the definition of a set of 
        network protocols to standardise the interface between the MPEG-2 
        Transport Stream and an IP subnetwork. It also suggests an optimised 
        encapsulation method for IP datagrams.  The requirements for these 
        functions are described, and a framework proposed for their 
        implementation.

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB      Sept 2001         

      
        1. Introduction 
         
        This document identifies requirements for a framework for transport 
        of IP Datagrams over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG2].  The 
        framework is also designed to be compatible with services  based on 
        MPEG-2, for example the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) architecture, 
        the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) system [ATSC; ATSC-
        G], and other similar MPEG-2 based transmission systems. Such 
        systems typically provide unidirectional (simplex) physical and link 
        layer standards, and have been defined  for a wide range of physical 
        media (e.g. Terrestrial TV [ETSI-DVBT; ATSC-PSIP-TC], Satellite TV 
        [ETSI-DVBS; ATSC-S],Cable Transmission [ETSI-DVBC; ATSC-PSIP-TC]).

        Although many MPEG-2 systems carry a mixture of types of data, MPEG-
        2 components may, and are, also used to build IP-only networks.  In 
        this case, standard system components offer advantages of mass 
        market and improved interoperability.  Such networks often do not 
        implement all parts of a DVB / ATSC system, and may for instance 
        support minimal, or no, signalling of Service Information (SI) 
        tables.  
         
        The service provided by a MPEG-2 transport multiplex offers a number 
        of parallel channels, which correspond to logical links (forming the 
        MPEG Transport Stream (TS)).  Each MPEG-2 TS channel is uniquely 
        identified by the Packet ID, PID, value carried in the header of 
        MPEG-2 TS packets. The PID value is a 13 bit field and, thus, the 
        number of channels is limited to 8192, some of which are reserved 
        for transmission of SI tables. Non-reserved TS logical channels may 
        be use to carry audio [ISO-AUD], video [ISO-VID], IP datagrams [ISO-
        DSMCC;ETSI-DAT;ATSC-DAT], or other data [ISO-DSMCC;ETSI-DAT; ATSC-
        DAT].

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB      Sept 2001         
      
         
        Similarities in the way PIDs are used may be observed with the 
        operation of virtual channels in ATM, however, unlike ATM, a PID 
        defines a unidirectional broadcast channel and not a point-to-point 
        to link; there is, as yet, no specified interface for connection 
        setup, or for signalling mappings of IP flows to PIDs, or to set the 
        Quality of Service, QoS, assigned to an MPEG-TS logical channel. 
      
        Data for transmission over the MPEG-2 transport multiplex is passed 
        to an encapsulator which typically receives PDUs (Ethernet 
        frames or IP datagrams). It formats each PDU into a series of TS 
        packets (usually adding an encapsulation header), forming a TS. 
         
        In a simple example, one or more TS are processed by a MPEG-2 
        multiplexor resulting in a TS Multiplex. In more complex examples, 
        the same TS may be fed to multiple MPEG-2 multiplexors and these 
        may, in turn, feed other MPEG-2 multiplexors (remultiplexing). 
        In all cases, the final result is a "TS Multiplex" which is 
        transmitted over the physical bearer towards the receiver. 
         
        To receive IP datagrams sent over a MPEG-2 transport multiplex, a 
        receiver needs to identify the specific TS Multiplex (physical link) 
        and also the TS logical channel (i.e. PID value of a logical link). 
        It is common for a number of MPEG-2 TS logical channels to carry 
        subnetwork Protocol Data Units (PDUs), and the receiver must 
        therefore filter (accept) IP datagrams sent with a number of PID 
        values, and must independently reassemble each subnetwork PDU. A 
        system which simultaneously receives from several TS logical 
        channels, utilise receiver hardware to filter unwanted TS logical 
        channels. Most current hardware has a limit on the maximum number of 
        active PIDs (e.g. 32).  In some cases, receivers may need to select 
        TS logical channels from a number of simultaneously active TS 
        Multiplexes. To do this, they need multiple physical receive 
        interfaces (e.g. RF front-ends and demodulators). Some applications 
        also envisage the concurrent reception of IP Datagrams over other 
        media not using MPEG-2 transmission.  
         
        Bi-directional (duplex) transmission can be provided in the DVB 
        framework by using one of a number of alternate return channel 
        schemes [DVB-RC]. Duplex IP paths may also be supported using non-
        DVB return links. One example of such an application is that of Uni-
        Directional Link Routing, UDLR [RFC3077]. 
         
        The DVB family of standards currently defines a mechanism for 
        transporting an IP packet, or Ethernet frame using the Multi-
        Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) [ETSI-DAT]. This scheme is also 
        supported in ATSC [ATSC-DAT; ATSC-DATG]]. It allows transmission of 
        IP datagrams or Ethernet_style frames in the control plane 
        associated with audio/video transport.  It includes a set of 
        optional header components and requires decoding of the control 
        headers.

        series of MPEG-2 Transport Stream, TS, packets (each TS packet 
        carries a header with a common Packet ID, PID, value). 
         
        The framework proposed in this document describes a set of protocols 
        designed to allow IP datagrams to be sent over an MPEG-2 TS logical 
        channel. Since most MPEG-2 transmission links are bandwidth-limited, 
        this needs to be simple, robust, and have good link efficiency (i.e. 
        small overhead) when transporting variable sized IP datagrams.  The 
        document also suggests the need for supporting protocols (e.g. to 
        support operation and configuration of the link, provide resolution 
        of the MPEG-2 TS logical channel, error reporting, etc).  
         
        The framework may also be applicable to other subnetworks utilizing 
        the MPEG-2 TS, and also similar links (e.g. other MPEG-2 
        transmission networks, regenerative satellite links [ETSI-BSM]).

        FORWARD DIRECTION: The dominant direction of data transfer over a 
        network path. Data transfer in the forward direction is called 
        "forward transfer".  Packets travelling in the forward direction 
        follow the forward path through the IP network. 
         
        MAC: Medium Access and Control of the Ethernet IEEE 802 standard of 
        protocols. 
         
        MPE: Multiprotocol Encapsulation [ETSI-DAT]. A scheme that  
        encapsulates Ethernet frames or IP Datagrams, creating a  
        DSM-CC Section. The Section will be sent in a series of TS Packets  
        over a TS logical channel. 
         
        MPEG-2: A set of standards specified by the Motion Picture Experts 
        Group (MPEG), and standardized by the International Standards 
        Organisation (ISO) [ISO-MPEG]. 
         
        PID: Packet Identifier. A field carried in the header of all MPEG-2 
        Transport Stream packets. This is used to identify the TS logical 
        channel to which it belongs [ISO-MPEG]. 
         
        REVERSE DIRECTION: The direction in which feedback control messages 
        generally flow (e.g. acknowledgments of a forward TCP transfer 
        flow). Data transfer could also happen in this direction (and it is 
        termed "reverse transfer"). 
         
        PRIVATE SECTION: a syntactic structure used for mapping all service 
        information (e.g. an SI table) into TS packets.  A table may be 
        divided into a number of sections.  All sections of a table must be 
        carried over a single TS logical channel. 
         
        SI TABLE: Service Information Table. In this document, the term is 
        used to describe any table used to convey information about the 
        service carried in a TS Multiplex (e.g. [ISO-MPEG]). SI tables are 
        carried in MPEG-2 private sections.  
         
        TS: Transport Stream [ISO-MPEG], a method of transmission at the 
        MPEG-2 level using TS packets; it represents level 2 of the ISO/OSI 
        reference model. See also TS logical channel and TS Multiplex. 
      
        TS LOGICAL CHANNEL: a channel identified at the MPEG-2 level; it 
        represents level 2 of the ISO/OSI reference model. All packets sent 
        over a channel carry the same PID value 
         
        TS MULTIPLEX: A set of MPEG-2 transport stream channels sent over a 
        single common physical link (i.e. a transmission at a specified 
        symbol rate, FEC setting, and transmission frequency). 
      
        TS PACKET: A fixed-length 188B unit of data sent over an MPEG-2 
        multiplex [ISO-MPEG]; it corresponds to the cells, of e.g. ATM 
        networks, and is frequently also referred to as a TS_cell.  Each TS 
        packet carries a 4B header, plus optional overhead including

        stamp information to synchronise a set of Transport Streams. 
         
         
     3. Motivation 
         
        This section describes existing solutions and the need for a new 
        framework. This framework may be used over a link in the forward 
        and/or the reverse direction. The protocols to be supported over a 
        link are: 
         
        (i)    IPv4 Unicast datagrams, destined for a single end host 
        (ii)   IPv4 Broadcast datagrams, sent to all end systems in an IP 
               network 
        (iii)  IPv4 Multicast datagrams 
        (iv)   IPv6 Unicast datagrams, destined for a single end host 
        (v)    IPv6 Multicast datagrams 
        (vi)   Datagrams with compressed IPv4 / IPv6 packet headers (e.g. 
               [RFC1114;RFC2507;RFC3095]) 
      
         
        Two issues are addressed by this framework: First that of providing 
        an efficient encapsulation scheme which may be easily implemented in 
        IP-based transmitters and receivers. Second, existing standards do 
        not define how an IP node should associate a particular IP address 
        with a subnetwork channel (PID, TS Multiplex). Bindings are required 
        for both unicast transmission, and multicast reception. In this 
        document, these are referred to as IP address resolution issues. 
      
        The following principles are suggested for this work: 
         
             (i) Ubiquity.  The framework operates below the IP network 
             layer. It must not require modifications to existing 
             implementations of IP (IPv4 or IPv6), UDP, TCP. 
           
             (ii) Minimal overhead.  The framework should minimize protocol 
             overhead, in terms of the number of additional bytes to be sent 
             in addition to the IP datagram and processing overhead in terms 
             of parsing effort of variable length headers or options fields 
             (see iv).  This is important for bandwidth-limited systems 
             (such as satellite, terrestrial radio/TV links). 
              
             (iii) Minimal set of required options.  Reducing the number and 
             type of optional parameters reduces the receiver processing 
             overhead.  Importantly, it also simplifies receiver 
             implementation, allowing easier implementation and promoting 
             better interoperability between vendor implementations. The 
             header format currently adopted by MPE known to be not optimal 
             for IP, incurring significant receiver processing overhead and 
             extra link overhead [CLC99].

             (iv) Maximum Link Thruput. The framework should offer minimal 
             transmit/receive processing load. In some cases, the use of 
             header compression may represent a useful trade-off in 
             increased processing overhead, but reduced packet header size. 
              
             (v) Flexibility. The framework should provide sufficient 
             flexibility to allow future inclusion of other mechanisms for 
             specific applications (e.g. synchronisation with other MPEG-2 
             IP channels). There is also need for the framework to operate 
             over the range of MPEG-2 multiplexes in the forward direction, 
             and the diverse range of return channel systems in the reverse 
             direction. 
           
             (vi) Compatibility. If new protocols are defined by the 
             framework, it is desirable that they allow co-existence with 
             existing schemes, such as MPE, to allow continued use of the 
             broad-base of existing equipment. 
           
             (vi) Scalability. The framework must be efficient when used in 
             both large and small networks.  The size of a network using 
             MPEG-2 transport may range from a pair of nodes, to one 
             including millions of receivers.  
      
        The specified framework and techniques to be developed may also be 
        suited to non-DVB systems employing the MPEG-2 TS, or other 
        (sub)networks offering similar transfer capabilities.  
       
         
     4. Requirements for IP datagrams 
         
        This section describes the requirements for transporting IPv4 and 
        IPv6 over MPEG-2 links The section identifies key needs and provides 
        examples of mechanisms that may be used to implement these. 
         
        (i)    MPEG-2 Transport Stream. The framework should provide 
               mechanisms to access the underlying network features (MPEG-2 
               timestamps, PIDs, etc). It should also offer guidance on 
               which MPEG-2 features are pre-requisites for this service, 
               and any optional fields which impact performance / correct 
               operation of the IP encapsulation.  
         
        (ii)   Probability of undetected packet error. There should be a 
               small (or negligible) probability of an undetected packet 
               error [LINK-ID]. The scheme therefore needs to be robust to 
               software failures and link loss. The need for a subnetwork 
               PDU CRC will be determined.  
      
        (iii)  TS logical channel Resolution. There is a need to signal the 
               PID and TS Multiplex that is associated with each IP flow to 
               the network layer at the sender and receiver (address 
               resolution).  To make such schemes robust to loss and state 
               changes within the MPEG-2 subnetwork, a soft-state approach

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB      Sept 2001         
      
               may prove desirable.  This could, for example, be implemented 
               via descriptors sent in the SI tables (using the MPEG-2 
               control plane), or in-band by a protocol using a data channel 
               (e.g. similar to the Ethernet address resolution protocol 
               (ARP)). 
         
        (iv)   IPv4 and IPv6. The framework must support IPv4 and IPv6 
               network protocols. To do this, the payload encapsulation may 
               require a type field in the subnetwork PDU to indicate the 
               type of the PDU being carried (e.g. IPv4, IPv6). 
      
        (v)    Compressed Headers. The framework must address the need in 
               certain applications for the support of header compression 
               schemes. This may require a type field in the subnetwork PDU 
               to indicate the type of the PDU being carried (e.g. IPv4, 
               IPv6, Compressed Header). 
      
        (vi)   Multicast. The framework must support IP multicast 
               transmission of IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams. Support for 
               broadcast must also be considered for IPv4. 
      
        (vii)  Frame size and fragmentation.  Specification of minimum and 
               maximum frame sizes (MTU).  The need (or not) for IP 
               fragmentation and transparent fragmentation to support the 
               minimum MTU [RFC1191;Ken87;LINK-ID]. There is no currently 
               anticipated need to support IPv6 Jumbograms. 
      
        (viii) Identification of subnetwork source/destination. A new 
               encapsulation scheme may need to support layer 2 addresses 
               (e.g. Ethernet MAC source and destination addresses) of nodes 
               in the MPEG-2 transport network. These are not required for 
               layer 3 functionality, and the need, and applicability, must 
               be addressed by the framework. 
      
        (ix)   Filtering. Support for efficient filtering and extraction of 
               IP packets. This may require layer 2 addresses or labelling 
               of streams corresponding to IP flows. 
      
        (x)    Diffserv and QoS.  The mapping of QoS functions may also be 
               addressed (if specific issues arose). This may include how 
               such fields as IP address, IP QoS/DSCP should be mapped to 
               the under-lying MPEG-2 transport stream.  
      
        (xi)   Security. The framework must permit use of IPSEC and clearly 
               identify any security issues concerning the specified 
               protocols. The security issues need to consider two cases: 
               unidirectional transfer (in which communication is only from 
               the sending IP end host to the receiving IP end host) and bi-
               directional transfer (i.e. where there is also a reverse 
               direction path between the receiving IP end host and the 
               sending IP end host).  Consideration should also be given to

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB      Sept 2001         
      
               security of the TS Multiplex, the need for closed user groups 
               and the use of MPEG-2 TS encryption. 
      
        (xii)  Management. There may be a future need for standardised SNMP 
               MIBs and error reporting procedures. The need for and scope 
               of this is yet to be determined. 
         
     The first goal of this work is to define a lightweight encapsulation 
     protocol that meets the above requirement. 
         
      
     5. Supporting Protocols 
         
        Information about the set of MPEG-2 TS logical channels carried over 
        a TS Multiplex is usually distributed via tables (service 
        information, SI) sent using channels assigned a specific (well-
        known) set of PIDs. This system was originally designed for 
        audio/video distribution to set-top-boxes.  The design requires 
        access to and processing of the SI table information (which is 
        carried in DSM-CC section format [ISO_DSMCC]).  This scheme is 
        complex, and reflects the complexity of delivering and co-ordinating 
        the various TS logical channels associated with a multimedia TV 
        programme. There is no direct support for IP mechanisms for 
        identification of the TS multiplex and PID in use for a particular 
        IP address.  
         
        One possible approach to provide TS multiplex and PID information 
        for IP services is to integrate additional information into the 
        existing MPEG-2 tables, or to define additional tables specific to 
        the IP service. 
         
        Another alternate approach is to carry this information over the a 
        TS data channel, (e.g. using a protocol similar to the Service 
        Announcement Protocol, SAP). Implementing this independently of the 
        SI tables, would ease implementation, by allowing it to operate on 
        systems where IP processing is performed in a software driver. It 
        may also allow the technique to be more easily adapted to other 
        similar delivery networks. It also is advantageous for networks 
        which use the MPEG-2 TS but links, but do not necessarily support 
        audio/video services and therefore do not need to provide full 
        interoperability with TV equipment (e.g. links used solely for 
        connecting IP (sub)networks). 
         
        A final possible approach is to design a query/response protocol 
        (like ARP) which operates over an MPEG-2 TS logical channel using a 
        previously agreed PID (e.g. configured, or communicated using a SI 
        table). 
         
        Work in this area includes: 
         
        (i)    Request by a sender to associate a PID with an IP flow.

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB      Sept 2001         
      
        (ii)   Request by a sender to establish a QoS association for a PID 
               carried over the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex. 
        (iii)  Indication of the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex capabilities to 
               configure the upstream IP sender.  
        (iv)   Indication to the IP receiver of the PID and TS Multiplex 
               that should be used for reception of IP datagrams from a 
               particular address. 
        (v)    Definition of a MIB to provide standard management of the IP 
               subnetwork using SNMP. 
         
        The IP address resolution support may also be suited for use with 
        other IP over MPEG-2 encapsulations (e.g., MPE [ETSI-DAT]). As part 
        of address resolution, there is also a need to signal whether MPE or 
        an IETF encapsulation is used. 
         
     6. Multicast Support 
         
        This section addresses specific issues concerning IPv4 and IPv6 
        multicast over MPEG-2 links.  
         
        These issues include, but are not restricted to: 
         
           (i)    Encapsulating multicast packets for transmission using a 
                  MPEG-2 TS. 
           (ii)   Mapping IP multicast groups to the underlying MPEG-2 TS 
                  logical channel (PID) and the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex. 
           (iii)  Provide signalling information to allow a receiver to 
                  locate an IP multicast flow within an MPEG-2 TS Multiplex. 
           (iv)   Determining group membership (e.g. utilising IGMP/MLD).  
           (v)    Error Reporting. 
         
        Appropriate procedures need to be specified to identify the correct 
        action when the same multicast group is available on separate TS 
        logical channels.  This could arise when different end hosts act as 
        senders to contribute IP datagrams with the same IP group 
        destination address. Another different case arises when a receiver 
        may potentially receive more than one copy of the same packet.  In 
        some cases, these may be sent in different TS logical channels, or 
        even different TS Multiplexes. 
         
        The primary goal of multicast support will be efficient filtering of 
        IP-multicast packets by the receiver, and the mapping of IPv4 and 
        IPv6 multicast addresses onto the associated PID value and TS 
        Multiplex.  The design should permit a large number of active 
        multicast groups, and should minimise the processing load at the 
        receiver when filtering and forwarding IP multicast packets. For 
        example, schemes that may be easily implemented in hardware would be 
        beneficial, since these may relieve the drivers and operating 
        systems from discarding unwanted multicast traffic.

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB      Sept 2001         
      
        A set of methodologies may be defined to assist in the evaluation of 
        the protocols defined by this framework. These could define 
        terminology, evaluation criteria (utilisation, throughput, loss 
        rate, undetected error rate, etc), and may specify tests to indicate 
        the impact of such parameters as IP Datagram size, IP version, 
        multicast/unicast, and rate of transmission.  A set of test cases 
        could also be defined to allow performance to be quantitatively 
        measured and compared. 
         
     8. Summary 
         
        This document proposes a framework for defining a set of protocols 
        to perform efficient and flexible support for IP network services 
        over networks built upon the MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS).  This 
        framework transmits IP datagrams using the Multiprotocol 
        Encapsulation (MPE), which is widely implemented, and in addition, 
        proposes a new optimised encapsulation procedure.  The framework 
        also includes one or more new MPEG-2 TS logical channel resolution 
        procedures to allow dynamic configuration of the sender and receiver 
        using an MPEG-2 link.  The framework will support IPv4 and IPv6 
        services in both the unicast and multicast modes.  Support for 
        compression is also a key element in this proposed framework.

     12. IANA Considerations 
         
         
        A set of protocols which meet these requirements, will require the 
        IANA to assign various numbers.  This document by itself, however, 
        does not require any IANA involvement.

        Appendix 1 Examples of Available Mechanisms for Encapsulation 
         
        NOTE: The text in this appendix is working notes, and not intended 
        for publication in the final document. 
         
        List of possible issues include: 
         
        (i)    Delineation of start and end of datagrams (and padding, if 
               required to end of a MPEG-2 TS packet). 
            - Should the MPEG-2 TS start-of-payload indicator be used? 
            - Many IP packets (e.g. a TCP ACK) are typically much smaller 
               than an MPEG-2 TS packet; Packing of multiple datagrams per 
               MPEG-2 packet may significantly improve link efficiency. 
             
        (ii)   Packets for one IP flow (i.e. a specific combination of IP 
               source and destination addresses) must be sent using the same 
               PID. It should not be assumed that all IP packets are carried 
               on a single PID, multiple PIDs must be allowed. Current DVB 
               implementations of DVB receivers frequently restrict the 
               number of PIDs that may be simultaneously received. A simpler 
               encapsulation method may reduce receiver complexity and/or 
               increase the number of PIDs that may be received.  
             
        (iii)  Subnetwork PDUs could have an encapsulation header with 
               address field(s) (if required, e.g. MAC or layer 2 end-point) 
               This may not be required for direct router-to-router 
               communication. 
               
        (iv)   Subnetwork PDUs could have a Protocol Type Field. 
                  - Is this required?  
                  - May be a pre-requisite for ROHC [RFC3095]?  
                  - Also useful for supporting extension headers 
                  - Also useful for IPv6 / IPv4 service access points. 
      
        (v)    Subnetwork PDUs must have a Payload Length Field. 
               - Padding must also be supported. 
      
        (vi)   Subnetwork options (to be discouraged, but could be provided 
               via an alternate protocol type field and an extension 
               header). 
         
        (vii)  Payload Checksum / CRC (required? or optional?)  
                [LINK-ID] suggests a CRC-32 may be suitable. A PDU CRC may 
               also be used to validate 
         
        (viii) Error Reporting. If an equipment is an IP device, then it 
               should conform to standard requirements for hosts [RFC1122] 
               or routers [RFC1812] (depending on its behaviour). 
         
        (ix)   The framework should allow IPSEC. Link level encryption may 
               be provided using an MPEG-2 TS option.

        (x)    There are benefits from designing a framework which may be 
               appropriate a packet/cell size different from 188B.  This 
               would allow evolution of the techniques, to support future 
               versions of MPEG-2 and other cell based physical layers. A 
               common standard would also be very desirable for hybrid 
               systems which employ different physical links in  the forward 
               and reverse directions.
