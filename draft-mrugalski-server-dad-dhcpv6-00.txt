             DHCPv6 Server side Duplicate Address Detection
                  draft-mrugalski-server-dad-dhcpv6-00

Abstract

   This document defines new way of performing DAD procedure.  DHCPv6
   maintain small pool of unique addresses.  DHCPv6 server performs DAD
   procedure for each address, before populating this uniqueness
   verified pool.  Client may ask for an address that already passed DAD
   test, thus speeding up client configuration process.

Internet-Draft           DHCPv6 server-side DAD                July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Once Mobile Node (MN) attaches to a new link, it obtains new IPv6
   address, using DHCPv6 protocol.  Once DHCPv6 exchange is concluded,
   MN determines address uniqueness using Duplicate Address Detection
   (DAD) procedure.  Such procedure introduces unwanted delays that are
   expecially problematic in mobile environments.  This document defines
   new way of performing DAD procedure.  DHCPv6 maintain small pool of
   unique addresses.  DHCPv6 server performs DAD procedure for each
   address, before populating this uniqueness verified pool.  Client may
   ask for address that already passed DAD test.


2.  Server Side DAD Option Format

   A DHCPv6 server may provide addresses that have already passed DAD
   tests.

                    Figure 1: DAD Address Option Format

   option-code:  OPTION_SERVER_SIDE_DAD (TBD).

   option-len:  0 (there are no fields in this option).


3.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   Server MUST complete DAD procedure, as specifed in [RFC4861], for
   each address included in DAD-verified pool.

   Server MUST NOT provide address that did not complete DAD procedure
   to client that requests DAD-verified address.

   Server SHOULD maintain separate pool for clients that request DAD-
   verified addresses.

   Server MUST include OPTION_SERVER_SIDE_DAD in the IA_NA option that
   was populated to indicate that provided address is indeed DAD-
   verified.

4.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   Client supporting server side DAD, MAY include OPTION_SERVER_SIDE_DAD
   in their IA_NA option to indicate that DAD-verified address is
   requested.

   TBD


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate one DHCP option codes referencing this
   document: OPTION_SERVER_SIDE_DAD.


6.  Security Considerations

   TBD
