   This document extends the applicability of the Generic Associated
   channel Label (GAL), enabling the realization of the communication
   between a Maintenance End Point (MEP) and a Maintenance Intermediate
   Point (MIP) in the MPLS-TP OAM architecture. This mechanism can only
   be used in the point-to-point co-routed bidirectional path of MPLS-
   TP networks. By introducing the MPLS-TP Sign Label, it enables the
   peer MEP to obtain the path information along the MPLS Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) or MPLS pseudowires (PWs). After that, it
   could number the MIPs along the path, and each MIP could record the
   pairing relationship of the forward and the backward directions of
   that transport path.

1. Introduction

   MPLS-TP OAM operates in the context of Maintenance Entities (MEs).
   For example, in the point-to-point co-routed bidirectional path of
   MPLS-TP networks, an ME includes two Maintenance End Points (MEPs),
   which reside at the boundaries of the ME, and MAY also include zero
   or a set of Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs), which reside
   within the ME, between the MEPs [8].

   MEPs are capable of initiating and terminating OAM messages.
   Meanwhile, MIPs are unaware of any OAM flows running between MEPs or
   between MEPs and other MIPs. MIPs can only receive and process OAM
   packets addressed to the MIP itself.

   When an MEP need to send an OAM message to an MIP, it sets the TTL
   of the LSP, Tandem Connection Monitoring (TCM) or PW label so that
   it will expire when the target MIP is reached. Then MIPs will find
   that the packet has a GAL just below the current label, so it will
   make a further scrutiny. After proper processing, a reply, if
   required, is returned to the MEP that originated this message [9].

   When the OAM packets are encapsulated in an IP header by default,
   the process above is easy to realize. But MPLS-TP OAM can not rely
   on this mechanism. In the environments where IP based routing and
   forwarding are not supported, how to send this reply and make the
   MEP know which MIP sends the message is uncertain.

   This document proposed a method to specify how the reply is returned
   and the related number mechanism by extending the former mechanism.
   The basic idea is that in the point-to-point co-routed bidirectional
   path of MPLS-TP networks, an MIP will record the pairing
   relationship of the forward and the backward directions of that
   transport path in a special Time To Live Label Forwarding
   Information Base (TTL LFIB). Therefore, when it receives an OAM
   packet and need to reply, the MIP will refer to the TTL LFIB to find
   the outgoing label and the egress interface and accomplish the reply
   process.

   The outline of the mechanism is as follows. Firstly, the source MEP
   sends a path numbering request packet along the path to the peer MEP,
   which is also received by each MIP. When the MIPs receive this
   packet, they will record the label information of the packet in TTL
   LFIB and add the swap label information about this path to the
   packet before forwarding. Secondly, the peer MEP receives this
   packet, and it will send a confirmation request message to each MIP.
   When the MIPs receive this message, they will accomplish the path
   information in the TTL LFIB and return a confirmation message.
   Finally, the peer MEP receives those confirmation messages. If they
   are all success ones, it will send a success path numbering reply
   message to the source MEP.

2. MPLS-TP Sign Label

   In order to realize the path numbering and TTL LFIB establishing,
   the peer MEP should obtain the path information firstly. This
   document specifies that a label is used for that purpose and calls

   this special label the MPLS-TP Sign Label (MTSL). One of the
   reserved label values defined in RFC 3032 [2] is assigned for this
   purpose. The value of the label is to be allocated by IANA; this
   document suggests the value 4.

   The use of this label is analogous to the use of the Router Alert
   Label. This label can be present anywhere in the label stack except
   at the bottom. When the MTSL is the top label, it alerts the Label
   Switching Router (LSR) that the packet needs a closer look.
   Therefore, the packet is not forwarded in hardware, but is looked at
   by a software process. When the packet is received, the MTSL is
   removed. Then a lookup of the next label in the label stack is
   performed in the Label Forwarding Information Base (LFIB) to decide
   where the packet needs to be switched to. Next, a special label
   action (push, swap, pop) is performed.

   If the label action is push, which means the LSR is a subnetwork
   ingress, the MTSL will be pushed back before normal push action and
   will become invisible until the egress of the subnetwork. If the
   label action is swap, which means the LSR is an MIP, the new label
   will be pushed into the label stack instead of a normal swap action.
   After that, the MTSL is pushed back on top of the label stack, and
   the packet is forwarded. If the label action is pop, it means that
   the packet gets to its destination, the peer MEP.

   The format of the MTSL is shown in Figure 1.

        Figure 2 The Path Numbering Packet Received by the Peer MEP

   If the MTSL message exceeds the path MTU because of recording the
   path's information continuously, the path numbering will fail. The
   necessary logging and alarming will help the administrator to solve
   the problem.

3. Path Numbering Mechanism

   This mechanism can be used in the point-to-point co-routed
   bidirectional path of MPLS-TP networks. This path's forward and
   backward directions follow the same route (links and nodes) across
   the network. Both directions are setup, monitored and protected as a
   single entity [10]. The path may be an LSP or a PW with two Label
   Edge Routers (LERs) and one or more LSRs. The two LERs act as the
   source MEP and the peer MEP, and the LSRs act as the MIPs.

   After the path is established, it is supposed that the two MEPs know
   this path is a co-routed bidirectional path and the pairing
   relationship of the two labels assigned to the forward and the
   backward directions in this MEP. For the realization of this
   mechanism, the MEPs SHOULD maintain an MIP number value in this
   path's maintenance information, whose default value is -1.

   This mechanism will start just after the establishment of the path.
   The first step is to send the path numbering request message, whose
   purpose is to number the MIPs and provide the path information hop-
   by-hop to the peer MEP kindly like the function of the Record Route

   Object in RSVP-TE [3]. The source MEP sends a special packet with an
   MTSL at the top of the label stack along the path to the peer MEP,
   which is also received by each MIP.

   When the MIPs receive this packet and find the MTSL, it is delivered
   to a local software module for processing. The process procedures
   are as follows.

   Firstly, it records the TTL value of the MTSL, and then removes the
   MTSL. The actual forwarding of the packet is determined by the label
   beneath the MTSL in the stack.

   Secondly, it looks up the label in the LFIB. It will find the
   matching element because the path has been established and the
   action should be swap. After that, it records the result, finishing
   the forward numbering of the path in the TTL LFIB.

   Thirdly, it changes the current label's S bits to 1, and pushes the
   new label found in LFIB into the label stack, which has the same TC
   bits, S bit and TTL bits as the current label.

   Finally, it pushes back the MTSL and updates the TTL bits by
   decreasing the TTL value recorded before by 1. And then, it forwards
   the new packet which is a little bigger than before according to the
   result of the former LFIB lookup.

   When the peer MEP receives this packet and finds the MTSL, what it
   does is a little different. Its process procedures are as follows.

   Firstly, it records the TTL value of the MTSL, and then the MTSL is
   removed. This step is the same as the former.

   Secondly, it looks up the label in the LFIB. It will find the
   matching element and the action should be pop. After that, it sends
   a confirmation request message to each MIP along the path. This is
   achieved by sending messages along the backward path to the source
   MEP with the TTL set successively to 1, 2, and so on. The total
   number of the messages will be the number of the MIPs, which is
   computed as 255 minus the current TTL value recorded in the first
   step of MTSL process procedure.

   Thirdly, after the MIPs receive this message because of the TTL
   expiring, they will accomplish the path information in the TTL LFIB
   and return a confirmation message to the peer MEP.

   Finally, the peer MEP receives those confirmation messages. If they
   are all success ones, it will send a success path numbering reply

   message to the source MEP. And then, it will update the MIP number
   value in this path's maintenance information.

4. TTL LFIB

   TTL LFIB is analogous to LFIB and most of its data information is
   copied from the LFIB of the LSR. Here the per platform label space
   is used for example [4]. Its element includes followed contents:

   Forward ingress label, forward number, forward egress interface,
   forward egress label; backward ingress label, backward number,
   backward egress interface, backward egress label.

   When an MIP receives the MTSL packet, it will finish the forward
   numbering of the path in the TTL LFIB. That procedure includes three
   steps. Firstly, copy current incoming label beneath the MTSL to the
   forward ingress label. Secondly, copy the outgoing interface and
   label found in the LFIB to the backward egress interface and
   backward egress label. Thirdly, compute the forward number.

   Here it is supposed that when the source MEP sends the path
   numbering request message, which is also called MTSL message in this
   document, the TTL bits of the MTSL at the top of the label stack is
   255 just like the default value set in RFC 3443 [5]. Then, when each
   MIP receives the MTSL, the TTL will decrease by one by sequence. The
   forward number will be computed as 256 minus the current TTL value
   recorded in the first step of the MTSL process procedure.

   When the MIPs receive the confirmation request message from the peer
   MEP, it will finish the backward numbering of the path in the TTL
   LFIB. That procedure also includes three steps. Firstly, copy
   current incoming label to the backward ingress label. Secondly, copy
   the outgoing interface and label found in LFIB according to the
   incoming label to the forward egress interface and forward egress
   label. Thirdly, set the backward number.

   When the peer MEP sends the confirmation request message, it will
   include a special ACH TLV which includes the label information
   brought by the MTSL message to the peer MEP. The backward number
   will be copied from the TLV information, which is further talked in
   section 5.1.

   After the path numbering process, each MIP will have a forward
   number and a backward number. The forward number will be 1, 2, 3 ...
   until the number of MIPs along the forward direction of the path.
   The backward number will also be 1, 2, 3 ... until the number of
   MIPs along the backward direction of the path. The forward number

Internet-Draft                  MTSL                    September 2009


   and backward number will only be available in this path. In fact,
   these two numbers also mean the number of MIPs from the MEP to the
   MIP.

   After the numbering, when an MIP receives an OAM packet addressed to
   itself, that is to say, the packet get TTL expiration at this MIP
   and the GAL is found just below the current label, and need to reply,
   it will refer to the TTL LFIB and perform the label swapping for the
   reply. As a result, the upper part of the OAM packet trace follows
   the forward/backward path and the lower part of the OAM packet trace
   follows the backward/forward path.

   The TTL value of the top label of the reply message is set to the
   forward number or the backward number according to the incoming
   label. Therefore, the message will also get TTL expiration at the
   target MEP, which could be distinguished from a normal OAM message
   sent by the peer MEP. Also, the message will include a special ACH
   TLV to indicate which MIP sends out the message.

   The paths of an LSR can be distinguished by the incoming label alone
   because the label merging is forbidden in the MPLS-TP networks. This
   is a basic requirement of the mechanism introduced in this document.

   When the bidirectional path is revoked, the information in the TTL
   LFIB also needs to be deleted just as the information in the LFIB.

5. Related ACH TLV Format

   This document has mentioned four kinds of messages, a path numbering
   request message, a confirmation request message, a confirmation
   message, a path numbering reply message. The path numbering request
   message is flagged by the MTSL and has its own special process
   procedure. Other three are normal OAM packets. They abide by the
   format defined in [6] and [7]. Their formats are shown in Figure 3.

               Figure 3 The Format of the Three OAM Messages

   The Channel Type field indicates the type of message carried on the
   associated control channel. Here a new channel type definition is
   needed because IP is not used as the multiplexer.

   In applications of this document, the three OAM messages all have a
   TTL value specially assigned at the top of the label stack and also
   a special ACH TLV to indicate the source information. Here three
   different ACH TLV types need to be allocated for the three messages,
   and also an ACH TLV type for the MIP addressing in the OAM
   communication after the path numbering need to be allocated. Its
   format is the same as the former three shown in Figure 3.

   These four kinds of TLV all have a TLV length value of 4. The value
   part is an MPLS label. The F bit stands for whether the message is a
   success message or not.

5.1. The confirmation request message

   After the peer MEP receives the MTSL message, it will send a
   confirmation request message to each MIP. The detailed format is
   described below.

   What the peer MEP receives is a label stack, the confirmation
   request messages will be filled according to that label stack which
   is called MTSLS. As said in Section 3, the MTSL will be removed
   firstly.

   In the first confirmation request message, the LSP or PW Label at
   the top will be the label addressed to the source MEP, and the TTL
   bits will be set to 1, and the label of the TLV will be copied from
   the label at the top of the label stack MTSLS. This label is used to

Internet-Draft                  MTSL                    September 2009


   be beneath the MTSL. However, its F bit will be set to 1, and the
   TTL bits will be set to the same as the top label. The TLV type is
   set to path numbering confirmation request. After that, the label at
   the top of the label stack MTSLS will be removed.

   The second confirmation request message will have the same top LSP
   or PW Label as the first one, and a TTL value 2. The label of the
   TLV will be copied from the new top label in the label stack MTSLS.
   The F bit is set to 1 and the TTL bits are set to 2, and the TLV
   type is set to path numbering confirmation request. Also, current
   top label in the label stack MTSLS will be removed.

   This procedure will loop for MIPs number times, which is computed
   before. After that, the top label of the label stack MTSLS will be
   the one initialed by the source MEP.

5.2. The confirmation message

   When the MIPs receive the confirmation request message, they will
   notice the TLV type in the message and finish the path numbering
   according to the label in the TLV of the confirmation request
   message. After that, it will refer to the TTL LFIB element newly
   built up to find the way back, and send a confirmation message.

   In the confirmation message, LSP or PW Label at the top will be the
   label found in the TTL LFIB, TTL bits will be set to backward number,
   and the label of the TLV will be copied from the top label.
   Meanwhile, its TLV type will be set to path numbering confirmation.
   Its F bit will be set to 1 to indicate it is a success message.

5.3. The path numbering reply message

   After the peer MEP receives all the confirmation messages, it will
   send a success path numbering reply message to the source MEP if
   they are all success ones. The detailed format is described below.

   LSP or PW Label at the top will be the label addressed to the source
   MEP, and the TTL value will be set to the MIP number plus one. The
   label of the TLV will be copied from the new top label in the label
   stack MTSLS, which is also the first label recorded. The F bit is
   set to 1 and the TTL bits are set to the same to the top label. The
   TLV type is set to path numbering reply.

   After the source MEP receives the success path numbering reply
   message, it will also update the MIP number value in this path's
   maintenance information.

   If the ME has no MIP, the mechanism of this document will not be
   necessary. This is easy to be discovered by the peer MEP when it
   receives the MTSL message. It will set the MIP number value in this
   path's maintenance information to zero and send a fail path
   numbering reply message. This message will have F bit set to 0 and
   TTL bits set to 1 in the label of ACH TLV. Also, the TTL of the top
   label is set to 1. After receiving the fail path numbering reply
   message, the source MEP will also set the MIP number value in this
   path's maintenance information to zero.

6. Applicability

   As talked before, the mechanism of this document can only be used in
   the point-to-point co-routed bidirectional path of MPLS-TP networks.
   It can be used in the environments where IP based routing and
   forwarding are supported or not supported.

   After the path numbering, the path will support OAM communications
   between an MEP and an MIP. Thus, to test the performance with
   respect to delay/jitter between an MEP and a certain MIP will not
   rely on the IP based demultiplexing.

   Also, this mechanism can be used combining with the BFD mechanism.
   If the BFD mechanism finds the path fail, the MEP can send a message
   to each MIP along the path to find the fail MIP.

7. Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in MPLS Generic Associated Channel
   [6] and MPLS Label Stack Encoding [2] apply to this document.

   Further security considerations will described in future versions.

8. IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA allocates a label value, to the
   MTSL, from the pool of reserved labels, and suggests this value to
   be 4.

   The Channel Type allocation and the Associated Channel TLV
   Registration discussed in MPLS Generic Associated Channel [6] and
   Definition of ACH TLV Structure [7] apply to this document. This
   document requests a new Channel Type and four new ACH TLV Types. The
   ACH TLV Types are path numbering confirmation request, path
   numbering confirmation, path numbering reply, and MIP addressing.

   Further IANA considerations will described in future versions.
