                     A Flags Extension for TLS 1.3
                       draft-nir-tls-tlsflags-01

Abstract

   A number of extensions are proposed in the TLS working group that
   carry no interesting information except the 1-bit indication that a
   certain optional feature is supported.  Such extensions take 4 octets
   each.  This document defines a flags extension that can provide such
   indications at an average cost of 1.5 bits each.  More precisely, it
   provides up to 64 such indications in a fixed-size, 12-octet
   extension.

1.  Introduction

   Since the publication of TLS 1.3 ([RFC8446]) there have been several
   proposal for extensions to this protocol, where the presence of the
   content-free extension in both the ClientHello and either the
   ServerHello or EncryptedExtensions indicates nothing except either
   support for the optional feature or an intent to use the optional
   feature.  Examples:

   o  An extension that allows the server to tell the client that cross-
      SNI resumption is allowed: [I-D.sy-tls-resumption-group].

   o  An extension that is used to negotiate support for authentication
      using both certificates and external PSKs:
      [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13-cert-with-extern-psk].

   This document proposes a single extension called tls_flags that can
   enumerate such flag extensions and allowing both client and server to
   indicate support for optional features in a concise way.

1.1.  Requirements and Other Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
   [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

   The term "flag extension" is used to denote an extension where the
   extension_data field is zero-length in all cases and the presence of

Internet-Draft                  TLS Flags                     March 2019


   the extension denotes either support for some feature or the intent
   to use that feature.

   The term "flag-type feature" denotes an options TLS 1.3 feature the
   support for which is negotiated using a flag extension, whether that
   flag extension is its own extension or a value in the extension
   defined in this document.

2.  The tls_flags Extension

   This document defines the following extension code point:

      enum {
         ...
         tls_flags(TBD),
         (65535)
      } ExtensionType;

   This document also defines the data for this extension as a 64-bit
   bit string, allowing for the encoding of up to 64 optional features.

      struct {
         uint64 flags;
      } FlagExtensions;

   Note that this document does not define any particular bits for this
   string.  That is left to the protocol documents such as the ones in
   the examples from the previous section.  Such documents will have to
   define which bit to set to show support, and the order of the bits
   within the bit string shall be enumerated in network order: bit zero
   is the high-order bit of the first octet as the flags field is
   transmitted.

   A client that supports this extension and also supports at least one
   of the flag-type features that use this extension SHALL send this
   extension with the flags field having bits set only for those
   extensions that it supports.

   A server that supports this extension and also supports at least one
   of the flag-type features that use this extension and that were
   declared by the ClientHello extension SHALL send this extension with
   the intersection of the flags it supports with the flags declared by
   the client.  The intersection operation MAY be implemented as a
   bitwise AND.  The server may need to send two tls_flags extensions,
   one in the ServerHello and the other in the EncryptedExtensions
   message.  It is up to the document for the specific feature to
   determine whether support should be acknowledged in the ServerHello
   or the EncryptedExtensions message.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new value from the TLS ExtensionType
   Values registry:

   o  The Extension Name should be tls_flags

   o  The TLS 1.3 value should be CH,SH,EE

   o  The Recommended value should be Y

   o  The Reference should be this document

   IANA is also requested to create a new registry under the TLS
   namespace with name "TLS Flags" and the following fields:

   o  Value, which is a number between 0 and 63.  All potential values
      are available for assignment.

   o  Flag Name, which is a string

   o  Message, which like the "TLS 1.3" field in the ExtensionType
      registry contains the abbreviations of the messages that may
      contain the flag: CH, SH, EE, etc.

   o  Recommended, which is a Y/N value determined in the document
      defining the optional feature.

   o  Reference, which is a link to the document defining this flag.

   The policy for this shall be "Specification Required" as described in
   [RFC8126].

4.  Security Considerations

   The extension described in this document provides a more concise way
   to express data that could otherwise be expressed in individual
   extensions.  It does not send in the clear any information that would
   otherwise be sent encrypted, nor vice versa.  For this reason this
   extension is neutral as far as security is concerned.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The idea for writing this was expressed at the mic during the TLS
   session at IETF 104 by Eric Rescorla.

   The current bitwise formatting was suggested on the mailing list by
   Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   Version -01 replaced the enumeration of 8-bit values with a 64-bit
   bitstring.

   Version -00 was a quickly-thrown-together draft with the list of
   supported features encoded as an array of 8-bit values.
