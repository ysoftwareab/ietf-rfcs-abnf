3. General Information of the service
	

      For the user who just want emails and not net savvy, He or she has to be able
to walk into a store and get a device like android and get an email address also from
that vendor. The buyer should also be to map his phone number to email address.
I should be able to type phone number or even the device MAC address in the to field of email and get it delivered
to the device that has the phone number or device MAC Address.

This increases usability. This with restrictions on functions to a device 
by using some programming like https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-pradeep-kumar-xplorer-posvm/
to allow a device to be used only for emails can make emails usable to a wider
audience who are not computer savvy.
