Abstract

   The IEEE has defined P802.1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) for managing
   bridged LAN networks.  The IETF has defined L2 Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
   that provide an emulated LAN service for such bridged networks.  These L2 VPNs are
   created using a collection of one or more point-to-point pseudo wires (PWs).  The
   IETF has also defined Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) for
   managing these PWs.  This memo discusses the ability of a combination of CFM and
   VCCV to meet the OAM requirements of a L2 VPN.

1. Introduction

   The IEEE has defined P802.1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) for managing
   bridged LAN networks [P802.1ag].  Both service providers and their customers can
   use CFM to manage a bridged network.

   The IETF has defined L2 Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that provide an emulated
   LAN service for such bridged networks.  These L2 VPNs are created using a
   collection of one or more point-to-point pseudo wires (PWs) [RFC3985].  These PWs
   can be configured in a flat, full-mesh topology to provide a Virtual Private LAN
   Service (VPLS) [RFC4761][RFC4762].  This VPLS core configuration can be augmented
   with additional non-meshed spoke nodes to provide a Hierarchical VPLS (HVPLS)
   service [RFC4762].  PWs can also be used to connect these spoke nodes to the VPLS
   core nodes.  Any Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) standard for L2
   VPNs must support both flat VPLS and hierarchical HVPLS configurations.

   In addition, any L2 VPN OAM solution must support all standardized methods by
   which the L2 VPN can be signaled.  For example, L2 VPNs signaled using BGP
   [RFC4761] and L2 VPNs signaled using LDP [RFC4762] must both be supported.  Also,
   all standardized tunnel protocols must be supported.

   For the purposes of this document, the terms "HVPLS" and "HVPLS instance" are used
   to signify a generic VPLS instance that may or not be hierarchical in topology.

   The IETF has defined Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) for
   monitoring individual PWs [VCCV].  VCCV does not monitor the interactions among
   PWs.

   This memo discusses the ability of a combination of CFM and VCCV to meet the OAM
   requirements of a L2 VPN.  This memo does not specifically address the OAM
   requirements of the non-L2 VPN portions of a provider's network.

1.1. OAM Functionality

   Providing OAM services for a HVPLS network requires at least the following
   functions:

   1. Topology discovery
   2. Service verification
   3. Fault detection
   4. Connectivity verification
   5. Performance monitoring

   With the exception of fault detection, all of the above functions were discussed
   in [TestHVPLS].

1.1.1. Topology discovery

   Topology discovery requires determining the current members of a HVPLS network.
   In [TestHVPLS], topology discovery concentrated on the ability to create a
   database containing both the IP and MAC addresses of all of the nodes
   participating in the HVPLS.

   This database is often required as one protocol may identify a node by its IP
   address while another protocol may identify the node by its MAC address.  For
   example, BGP knows a PE [RFC4761] node, and LDP knows a PE-rs [RFC4762] node, by
   its IP address.  CFM knows each of these nodes by its MAC address.  This database
   allows network operators to cross-reference between protocol addresses.

1.1.2. Service verification

   Service verification determines if the service aware nodes have been consistently
   configured and any associated hardware has been successfully updated [TestHVPLS].
   This verification must be such that feedback is available in a timely manner
   following network configuration.

1.1.3. Fault detection

   Although a service may have been configured and verified, there remains a
   possibility that the service will be interrupted at a later time.  Network
   operators need notification of such interruptions as quickly as possible to
   minimize the impact to their customers.  While lower layer protocols may identify
   some problems, it is impossible to completely guarantee the continued operation of
   a HVPLS network without some sort of detection operating at the HVPLS level.

   Fault detection for a HVPLS network must identify data plane problems that cannot
   be detected by the HVPLS control plane or will not be detected by the HVPLS
   control plane in a timely manner.  As such, it is expected that some type of
   periodic health check message will be required.

1.1.4. Connectivity verification

   There are five logical steps to verifying the connectivity of a HVPLS network
   [TestHVPLS]:

   1. All nodes are operational
   2. All peer sessions are operational
   3. All tunnels are transporting data packets correctly
   4. Data packets can be exchanged between any two nodes
   5. Actual customer devices can communicate with devices at any site

   The above steps are representative of the steps that would be taken by a network
   operator while trying to identify the cause of a HVPLS network problem.

1.1.5. Performance Monitoring

   Performance monitoring, such as determining round-trip times, jitter, average
   packet throughput, etc. [TestHVPLS] may be described in a future version.  In the
   meantime, service providers are already using external measurement devices to
   perform some of this function.

2. CFM and VCCV applicability

   The L2VPN work group has taken the direction that testing of the "bridge"
   functionality in a HVPLS node should be done using bridge OAM standards.
   Therefore, CFM should be used to test the bridge module component of the VPLS
   reference model described in [RFC4664].

   In addition, VCCV is to be used to test the individual PWs shown in the [RFC4664]
   reference model.

2.1. CFM function placement

   While a HVPLS node may participate in a CFM Maintenance Domain (MD) at the
   customer level, complete testing of the HVPLS portion of the network requires that
   a CFM Maintenance Area (MA) be created at the provider level with the HVPLS nodes
   as Maintenance Points (MPs).  A Maintenance association End Point (MEP) is created
   for any HVPLS node with a customer attachment circuit (AC).  A MEP or a
   Maintenance domain Intermediate Point (MIP) can be created for any HVPLS node
   without a local AC.

   An example of such a configuration using the reference model in [RFC4664] is shown
   in Figure 1.

   Note that the bridge module component has a single emulated LAN interface.
   Section 2.2 from [RFC4664] states:

   'This framework specifies that each "bridge module" have a single "Emulated LAN
   interface".'

   CFM packets are not processed by the emulated LAN components.  For example, VPLS
   forwarders do not recognize CFM packets.  They forward CFM packets based on their
   destination MAC addresses.

   The MD Levels chosen in Figure 1 are based on Section L.3, "MD Level allocation
   alternative," in [P802.1ag].  MD Level 5 is a customer MD Level.  MD Levels 4 and
   3 are service provider MD Levels.  The MIPs shown at MD Level 5 are present if the
   service provider participates in the customer's MA.  The MEPs at MD Level 4 are Up
   MEPs whose MD includes the bridge module components.  The MIP at MD Level 5 and
   the MEP at MD Level 4 are normally at the point where the customer attaches to the
   provider's network.  The MEPs at MD Level 3 are Down MEPs whose MD is the Emulated
   LAN portion of the reference model.

   To apply CFM to a HVPLS network, the example network from Figure 3 in [RFC4762] is
   used.  A modified version of that example is shown Figure 2.

                        Figure 2: Example HVPLS network

   In Figure 2, the three PE-rs nodes have no local attachments.  Therefore, these
   nodes do not require a bridge module component for HVPLS operation.  However, as
   is discussed in Section 3.4, there are potential benefits to having a CFM presence
   in these nodes.

   module components are included in the PE-rs nodes even though they are not
   strictly required.

   In the network shown in Figure 3, it is important to note that packets transmitted
   from MTU1-s to MTU2-s do not pass through the bridge module components of PE1-rs
   or PE3-rs.

   The network shown in Figure 2, and the associated function placement shown in
   Figure 3, assume that the customer attaches to the provider's network at the edge
   of the L2 VPN.  However, a provider may use Ethernet access networks such that the

   example, a provider may attach a customer as shown in Figure 4.

   In this case, the provider would normally utilize CFM to the edge of the provider
   network.  This would lead to the CFM function placement shown below in Figure 5.
   The customer-level MIP and the provider-level MEP are created on provider bridge
   B1 in order to maximize CFM coverage.

2.2. VCCV function placement

   VCCV is used to verify the individual PWs that are used in the emulated LAN of the
   [RFC4664] reference model.  As such, VCCV can be used to verify the connections
   between the VPLS forwarders that comprise the emulated LAN.

2.3. VCCV Connectivity Verification types

   VCCV provides for the use of LSP-Ping [RFC4379] or ICMP Ping Connectivity
   Verification types (CV types).  The applicable mode depends on the underlying PSN
   [VCCV].  For the purposes of this document, VCCV is described as using a generic
   "Ping" CV type.  The type actually used will depend on the underlying PSN.

   Note that VCCV also provides for the use of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
   (BFD) [BFD] as a CV type.

3. CFM and VCCV Capabilities

   The OAM discussions in the following sections are based on the function placements
   described in Section 2.

3.1. Topology discovery

   Each MEP in the network sends Continuity Check Messages (CCMs) on a periodic
   basis.  By including the optional Sender ID TLV in the messages, each MEP and MIP
   can learn the IP addresses of the MEPs in the network to which it has
   connectivity.  If desired, this database can be compared to a configured database
   of expected network nodes or to a database obtained via an autodiscovery method
   such as BGP [RFC4761].

   In the network in Figure 3, nodes PE1-rs and PE3-rs are shown with a MEP and an
   associated bridge module component even though they are not required for HVPLS
   operation.  Without these MEPs and bridge modules, these nodes would not appear in
   the CCM topology database of MTU1-s or MTU3-s.

   MIPs do not send CCM messages.  Therefore, a database built using CCM messages
   would not include MIPs.  Should any HVPLS node have only a MIP entity, it would
   not appear in a topology database created using CCMs.

   VCCV is not applicable to topology discovery.

3.2. Service verification

   As discussed in Section 3.1, if a new node with a MEP is added to a HVPLS network,
   other nodes will be able to verify connectivity to the new MEP by receipt of a CCM
   from the new node.  Depending on the timings between the establishment of all of

Internet-Draft     OAM for L2 VPN Networks Using CFM and VCCV        November 2007


   the new PWs and the sending of the new node's initial CCM, the other nodes may
   recognize the new MEP quickly following its configuration.

   However, in a stable environment, the new node might require a maximum of 35
   minutes to ensure that it received a CCM message from all of its MEP peers.

   In sizeable networks, the CCM transmission interval may be set to a large value to
   minimize system loading.  For example, the CFM defined intervals include 10
   seconds, 1 minute, and 10 minutes [P802.1ag].  In addition, a node should wait
   multiple transmission intervals before assuming that it does not have connectivity
   to another MEP peer.  Thus, using CCM receipt to ensure that a new node with a MEP
   is correctly included in the network may require waiting up to 35 minutes.

   As MIPs do not send CCM messages, only the nodes that have a MEP at a certain
   level within a given MA will participate in CCM-based service verification.

   In addition to confirming the receipt of CCMs from every expected MEP peer, MEPs
   can also verify that that they are not receiving CCMs from unexpected MEPs or CCMs
   for unexpected MAs.  MEPs can also check for loops back to themselves by ensuring
   that they do not receive their own CCMs.

   A new HVPLS node that runs VCCV can verify quickly that the PWs to its direct
   peers are operational.  For example, when node MTU1-s is added to the network in
   Figure 2, it can quickly verify that the PW to PE1-rs is operational.  It will
   have to depend on the receipt of CCMs from other nodes to verify the operation of
   the entire emulated LAN.

   CCM messages do not support the CFM Data TLV.  As such, using only CCM does not
   verify that the MTU settings of all of the network's components are consistent.
   VCCV using Ping can check MTU settings on an individual PW basis.  VCCV using BFD
   does not have this capability.

3.3. Fault detection

   Once a new HVPLS node has been verified as operational, network administrators
   need the continued operation of the network to be monitored.  This requires that
   periodic verification be performed by maintenance entities.

   CCM messages are transmitted by MEPs on a periodic basis.  A fault is declared
   when multiple consecutive messages are not received.  The period for CCM message
   transmission can be from 3.3 milliseconds to 10 minutes [P802.1ag].  There are
   obvious trade-offs involved between improved failure detection time and increased
   system utilization.

   CCM-based failure detection monitors the entire HVPLS network including the
   emulated LAN.  Each node maintains a CCM database of all of the MEPs in each HVPLS
   instance to track received CCM messages.  Each MEP knows when it has lost

Internet-Draft     OAM for L2 VPN Networks Using CFM and VCCV        November 2007


   connectivity to any other MEP in the HVPLS.  In addition, CCMs have a Remote
   Defect Indicator (RDI) flag that indicates whether or not the sending MEP is
   receiving CCMs from all of its expected MEP peers.  The receipt of a CCM with the
   RDI flag set indicates that there is a missing connection somewhere in the
   network.  For example, a partial mesh in the HVPLS core would result in RDI flags
   being set in CCMs.

   VCCV provides failure detection for individual PWs.  With VCCV using BFD,
   connectivity messages are transmitted on a periodic basis on each VCCV session (on
   each PW).  As BFD is designed to be a "low-overhead" protocol [BFD], the per-
   message processing overhead for VCCV with BFD should be less than for CCMs.  It is
   therefore possible that the failure detection times for VCCV using BFD may be less
   than for CFM using CCMs.  Also, since the VCCV database tracks only local PWs, it
   should be smaller than a CCM database.  However, VCCV does not detect failures in
   the VPLS forwarder part of the emulated LAN.

   VCCV using Ping can also be used to provide failure detection by periodically
   sending ping packets.

   While not specified in either [P082.1ag] or [VCCV], it is possible that an
   implementation could exchange information between the two protocols.  Such
   interactions may be discussed in a future version of this document.

3.4. Connectivity verification

   Connectivity verification in this context deals mainly with problem determination.
   It provides tools that a network operator can use to determine the cause of a
   problem.

3.4.1. Operational nodes

   MEPs and MIPs can create a database with information concerning the receipt of
   CCMs from every known MEP.  This database provides operators with a readily
   available confirmation of the operational state of network nodes.

   As discussed in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2, CCMs are transmitted on a periodic
   basis.  Therefore, use of a CCM database as an indication that a remote node is
   operational has an amount of uncertainty that is proportional to the CCM transmit
   interval.

   If VCCV is being used, VCCV provides verification that all peer nodes are
   operational.  This information is readily available to network operators.  As with
   CCMs, there is an amount of uncertainty that is proportional to the interval at
   which BFD or Ping messages are being sent.

Internet-Draft     OAM for L2 VPN Networks Using CFM and VCCV        November 2007


3.4.2. Operational peer sessions

   As the flooding of CCMs is subjected to the split-horizon operation described in
   [RFC4762], receipt of CCMs from all known MEPs can only occur when all peer
   sessions are operational.

   VCCV by definition tests peer sessions.  If all VCCV sessions are operational,
   then all peer sessions are operational.

   Both CCM and VCCV verification of operational peer sessions are subject to the
   same timing windows discussed in Section 3.4.1.

3.4.3. Operational tunnels

   As both CCM and VCCV messages are encapsulated using the same tunnels that are
   used for normal data transmission, the node and peer session verifications
   discussed above provide confirmation about operational tunnels.

   Note that many tunneling protocols have their own OAM capabilities that operators
   can invoke based on the results of HVPLS and/or PW tests.  For example, MPLS LSPs
   can be verified using LSP-Ping.  In addition, BFD can be used to monitor operation
   between any two forwarding engines.

3.4.4. Exchange data between HVPLS nodes

   CCMs are sent to a group MAC address.  CCMs are processed and forwarded in the
   MEP/MIP control plane.  As such, CCMs check flood lists, but verification is based
   on the control plane's ability to check hardware entries.

   A network operator can initiate Loopback Messages (LBMs) and Linktrace Messages
   (LTMs) [P802.1ag] to any MEP or MIP in the HVPLS.

   LBMs check unicast forwarding.  LBMs use a unicast destination MAC address and are
   processed by the normal data plane.  MIPs flood LBMs for unknown unicast MAC
   addresses.  This requires that the data planes have the filters necessary to
   insure that LBMs are not forwarded outside of the MD.

   LTMs check the path to a MEP/MIP.  LTM frames use a group destination MAC address
   and verify the path by the control plane's checking of known hardware entries.
   LTMs are not flooded by MEPs/MIPs and therefore do not check the flooding of
   unknown unicast packets.  The destination of a LTM must be the known MAC address
   of a MEP/MIP.  Every MEP/MIP involved must have already learned that MAC address.
   Note that periodically transmitting CCMs insures that the MAC addresses of MEPs
   are known.

   As is shown in Figure 3, packets forwarded by a VPLS forwarder are not processed
   by the bridge module component.  For example, consider a LTM packet sent from

   MTU1-s with a destination of MTU3-s.  The destination MAC address of this packet
   will be a group address as defined in Table 8-10, "Linktrace Message Group
   Destination MAC Addresses," of [P802.1ag].  This will be an unknown MAC address to
   the VPLS forwarders of PE1-rs and PE3-rs.  As such, the VPLS forwarders will flood
   the packet.  The bridge modules in PE1-rs and PE3-rs will not process the packet
   prior to it being flooded to MTU3-s.  In addition, the bridge module components of
   PE1-rs and PE3-rs will only know the destination as reachable over the same
   emulated LAN interface from which the LTM was received.  As a result, MTU1-s will
   receive a LTR only from MTU3-s.  An operator initiating a LTM at MTU1-s would not
   see PE1-rs or PE3-rs in the path to MTU3-s.

   Note that while PE1-rs and PE3-rs do not respond to LTMs destined for MTU3-s in
   the above discussion, they will respond to LBMs and LTMs addressed directly to
   them.

   VCCV using Ping can be used to provide an on-demand verification of data exchange
   between peers.  Note that VCCV requires a "control channel" [VCCV] which includes
   the normal encapsulation plus either:

   o  Use of a PW control word
   o  Addition of a router alert label
   o  Setting of the PW Label TTL = 1

   LBMs and VCCV Pings can include variable size data fields to verify operation of
   MTU sized packets.  LTMs do not support the CFM Data TLV.  BFD packets used for
   VCCV do not support variable packet sizes.

3.4.5. Data exchange between customer devices

   A network operator can initiate LTMs to any MAC address, including customer MAC
   addresses.  This provides verification of the path taken within the HVPLS network
   towards the customer MAC.  It does not provide verification of the actual
   forwarding of the packet at the egress from the HVPLS network.

   LTM frames use a group destination MAC address and verify the path by the control
   plane's checking of known hardware entries.

   LTMs do not support the CFM Data TLV so this verification cannot be performed
   using MTU-sized packets.

   Note that LTMs require that every MEP/MIP involved has already learned the
   customer MAC address.  This can sometimes place additional burden on network
   operators to insure that the customer MAC has been learned at each MEP/MIP.

   VCCV is not applicable to verification using customer MAC addresses.

4. Additional CCM and VCCV considerations

   When deployed throughout an entire HVPLS network, the scalability of any OAM
   solution must be considered.

   The target MAC address for a LBM is used as the destination MAC in the Ethernet
   header.  The target MAC address for a LTM is contained in a destination MAC field
   that is processed in the control plane.  CFM is designed with the expectation that
   target MAC addresses are already learned, as flooding of LTMs is not permitted.
   Therefore, it is expected that the forwarding tables for each HVPLS instance
   contain an entry for every MEP in the MA.  These MAC addresses may not be required
   for normal HVPLS operation.  As this is on a per-instance basis, this may result
   in a significant increase in table sizes.

   When a MP at the provider level is defined on a HVPLS node, hardware filters are
   required to prevent provider level CFM packets from being forwarded outside of the
   provider network.  This is on a per-instance basis.  It is reasonable to expect


Stokes, et al.               Expires May 5, 2008                     [Page 18]

Internet-Draft     OAM for L2 VPN Networks Using CFM and VCCV        November 2007


   that similar filters would be required with any other OAM solution.  In addition,
   the provider nodes may also be participating in customer MAs.  If so, then the
   node implementation will already be capable of installing CFM type filters.

   VCCV also requires filters to insure that OAM packets are not forwarded beyond the
   VCCV session.  These filters must trap the control channel chosen from the list in
   Section 3.4.4.

   If both CFM and VCCV are used, then both sets of hardware filters will be
   required.

   CFM system load is driven by the transmit interval and the number of MEPs in the
   MA.  If CFM is not intended for rapid fault detection, the transmit interval can
   be set to as much as 10 minutes, which should result in minimal system load.  If
   CFM is intended for rapid fault detection, the transmit interval can be set to as
   little as 3.3 milliseconds, potentially resulting in an extremely large system
   load.

   VCCV system load is driven by the negotiated transmission interval and the number
   of VCCV sessions (number of PWs).  Note that it is possible that different VCCV
   sessions may negotiate to different transmission times.  Setting low transmission
   intervals on a large number of PWs will potentially result in an extremely large
   system load.

5. Network operation based on CFM and VCCV

   Given the capabilities discussed in Section 3, there are multiple approaches that
   can be used to deploy OAM in a HVPLS network.

5.1. Combined CFM and VCCV solution

   In this environment, CFM is used for topology discovery, service verification, and
   connectivity verification.  VCCV is used for fault detection.  When a HVPLS
   instance is created or updated, CCM messages with Sender ID TLVs provide the
   initial verification.  LBM messages with Data TLVs are used to verify that MTU-
   sized packets can be sent to any peer in the event of troubleshooting.  LTM
   messages can also be used for additional troubleshooting.  VCCV sessions are
   established for every PW for fault detection.

   This network configuration has several drawbacks.  There is no "on-demand" system-
   wide service verification.  To improve system-wide service verification time when
   using CCM messages, the transmit intervals need to be set small enough to force
   CCM messages in the timeframe expected by an operator.  Assuming that interval is
   on the order of seconds, this would require sending CCM messages at a far greater
   rate than is required to maintain the MAC information needed for problem
   determination.  The system burden of VCCV sessions on every PW would be driven by
   the expected fault detection interval.

Internet-Draft     OAM for L2 VPN Networks Using CFM and VCCV        November 2007


   The LTM exposures discussed in Section 3.4.4 apply to this solution.  In a
   hierarchical HVPLS environment, PE-rs nodes in the data path will not respond to
   LTMs that are not addressed to them.

5.2. CFM-only solution

   This environment is the same as described above in Section 5.1 except that CCM is
   used for fault detection instead of VCCV.  The system burden of CCMs at an
   aggressive rate is potentially greater than the system burden of VCCV at a similar
   rate.  This exposure is due to the fact that CCMs are received from every MEP in
   the HVPLS network instead of just from peers.  This distinction is obviously more
   important in a hierarchical HVPLS environment than in a flat VPLS environment.
   Also, when VCCV is using BFD, the basic protocol is designed to be a "low
   overhead" protocol.

   This environment has the advantage that it eliminates one periodic hello-type
   message and one set of hardware filters.  This environment also potentially
   reduces the concerns about system-wide service verification time as discussed in
   Section 5.1 by reducing the time required for a new node to receive CCM messages
   from every other node.

   The same LTM exposures discussed in Section 3.4.4 apply to this solution.  In a
   hierarchical HVPLS environment, PE-rs nodes in the data path will not respond to
   LTMs that are not addressed to them.

5.3. CFM and VCCV combined with other protocols

   There are certain to be scaling limits to how rapidly fault detection can be run
   on every HVPLS instance or on every PW.  In addition, it may not be prudent to
   attempt to detect HVPLS or PW failures at a rate faster than the underlying
   tunneling protocol can detect and recover from failures.

   One approach is that rapid fault detection is best handled at the tunneling
   protocol level and that fault detection at the PW and/or HVPLS level is on a more
   extended timeframe.  For example, Section 5.2.2 of [OAM_MSG] states:

   "For PWE3 over an MPLS PSN and an MPLS-IP PSN, it is effective to run a defect
   detection mechanism over a PSN Tunnel frequently and run one over every individual
   PW within that PSN Tunnel less frequently. However in case the PSN traffic is
   distributed over Equal Cost Multi Paths (ECMP), it may be difficult to guarantee
   that PSN OAM messages follow the same path as a specific PW. A Service Provider
   might therefore decide to focus on defect detection over PWs."

   In an environment where ECMP is not a problem, rapid fault detection could be
   achieved by closely monitoring the underlying tunnels.  HVPLS instances, and their
   associated PWs, could be verified when they are created or updated.  Fault
   detection at the HVPLS and/or PW level would then become a matter of checking for


Stokes, et al.               Expires May 5, 2008                     [Page 20]

Internet-Draft     OAM for L2 VPN Networks Using CFM and VCCV        November 2007


   corruption.  Note that one possible catalyst for corruption is the recovery action
   taken when a tunnel failure is detected.  Therefore, it would be desirable to have
   some sort of failure detection or verification that could be run on the affected
   PWs and/or HVPLS instances soon after a tunnel recovery action.

   With VCCV using Ping, it is possible to check the affected PWs immediately
   following the recovery action.  Also, it is possible to check only the PWs
   affected by a tunnel recovery action.

   Therefore, fault detection could be done using a combination of protocols.  Rapid
   fault detection could be done on tunnels using tunnel OAM protocols (for example,
   BFD on a LSP).  This would significantly reduce the system overhead compared to
   performing rapid fault detection on every HVPLS instance or on every PW.
   Background, or less frequent, fault detection could be done on a complete HVPLS
   instance using CCM.  In this case, CCM could potentially use a large transmit
   interval.

   Service verification could be done on a per-PW basis by VCCV using Ping.  This
   could be automatically done immediately following configuration changes or tunnel
   recovery actions.

   Topology discovery and system-wide service verification could be done using CCM.
   The CCM transmit interval chosen would determine how rapidly this information is
   available.  This trade-off between improved verification response and increased
   system load is a drawback of this combination of protocols.

   Connectivity verification could be done using CFM LBMs and LTMs.  The same LTM
   exposures discussed in Section 3.4.4 still apply to this solution.  In a
   hierarchical HVPLS environment, PE-rs nodes in the data path will not respond to
   LTMs that are not addressed to them.

6. Concerns

   While the combination of CFM and VCCV provides significant information for a
   network operator, the combination does not provide a complete OAM solution for a
   L2 VPN environment.

   When applied to the [RFC4664] reference model of a L2 VPN node, CFM does not
   recognize the components of the emulated LAN.  As such, CFM does not provide
   verification or problem determination for VPLS forwarders or PWs.  VCCV provides
   coverage for the PWs in the emulated LAN, but does not address the VPLS
   forwarders.  This leaves a significant portion of the emulated LAN completely
   opaque from a standardized OAM perspective.  Some of the resulting exposures
   include:





Stokes, et al.               Expires May 5, 2008                     [Page 21]

Internet-Draft     OAM for L2 VPN Networks Using CFM and VCCV        November 2007


   o  There is no OAM protocol to address any problems in the VPLS forwarders.  For
      example, there is no OAM protocol to troubleshoot incorrect VPLS forwarder
      flooding.

   o  There is no OAM protocol to address the interactions of VPLS forwarders with
      their associated PWs.  For example, there is no OAM protocol to troubleshoot
      incorrect mappings of MAC addresses to PWs.

   o  Receipt of a CCM message with the Remote Defection Indication (RDI) bit may be
      the result of a missing PW.  However, there is no information about the
      location of the missing PW(s).

   Note that simply trying to apply CFM inside the emulated LAN will not result in a
   complete OAM solution for a L2 VPN emulated LAN.  It does not appear that CFM was
   designed to cover the internal mechanisms of a generic emulated LAN.  The CFM
   standard does not provide guidance for applying it inside of an emulated LAN.  The
   formats used by CFM are specifically designed to carry LAN/bridge information.
   For example, the Reply Egress TLV in a Linktrace Reply (LTR) message contains
   fields with MAC Address and Port ID information [P802.1ag].  In a L2 VPN emulated
   LAN environment, the information required would include the PW label, the PW peer
   IP address, and the tunnel ID.

   Between CFM and VCCV, only CFM CCMs provide verification on a complete HVPLS
   instance basis.  CCMs are sent based only on a periodic transmit timer.  There is
   no ability to request an on-demand CCM transmission for verification purposes.
   Therefore, verifying the complete network following a configuration change or a
   network event using CCMs requires waiting a complete CCM transmit interval.  When
   CCMs are being used for rapid fault detection, this transmit interval is
   potentially small.  However, when CCMs are not being used for rapid fault
   detection, this transmit interval would normally be increased to reduce system
   loading.  In this case, the interval could easily become longer than the expected
   time for system verification to complete.

   The fact that LTM messages are only propagated in the direction of known MAC
   addresses may cause confusion on the part of network operators when the
   destination is a customer MAC.  It may also be difficult for an operator to force
   a customer MAC to be re-learned in order to continue a troubleshooting effort.

7. Suggested practices

   CFM and VCCV should be used in a L2 VPN environment to perform the functions that
   they do well in that environment.

   MIPs should be installed at the customer attachment points as shown in Figure 1
   and Figure 3 if a provider decides to participate in a customer's MA.




Stokes, et al.               Expires May 5, 2008                     [Page 22]

Internet-Draft     OAM for L2 VPN Networks Using CFM and VCCV        November 2007


   Installing Up MEPs at the customer attachment points as shown in Figure 1 and
   Figure 3 provides the most complete coverage of a HVPLS network.  The associated
   MD includes all of the bridge module and emulated LAN components.

   In this MD, CCMs should be used to provide continuity checking on the entire L2
   VPN.  The CCM transmit interval should be set as desired based on the existence of
   other monitoring protocols as well as system processing capacity.  LBMs and LTMs
   can be used to troubleshoot a domain that includes all of the L2 VPN components.

   Given the exposures discussed in Section 6, another OAM protocol specifically
   designed for the emulated LAN function shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3 may be
   required.  The need to install Down MEPs at the emulated LAN interface will be
   based on the capabilities and expectations of that emulated LAN OAM protocol.

   It is anticipated that any OAM protocol that addresses the emulated LAN components
   will use make use of VCCV.  The role of VCCV in monitoring PWs (and thus their
   underlying tunnels) will be based on the existence of other monitoring protocols
   as well as system processing capacity.

   For CFM and VCCV to be used successfully on a widespread basis in L2 VPN
   environments, ease of use will be an important requirement.  The creation of a MD
   at the customer attachment points should require minimal configuration.  There
   should be a default MD Level (for example, 4) and a default algorithm to create
   any required IDs.  The use of LBMs and LTMs should be as close as possible to the
   well-known use of IP ping and traceroute.

8. Security Considerations

   As no new protocols are defined, any security considerations are based on the
   security considerations of the protocols that are referenced in this document.

   It is important to note that any L2 VPN OAM solution should insure that
   information about a service provider's network is not leaked to the customer
   network.

9. IANA Considerations
