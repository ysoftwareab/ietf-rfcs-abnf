Abstract

   This memo registers the Enumservice "vCard" with three subtypes
   (empty subtype, "xml", "rdf") using the URI schemes "http" and
   "https".  This Enumservice is to be used to refer from an ENUM domain
   name to a vCard instance describing the user of the respective E.164
   number.

   Information gathered from those vCards could be used before, during
   or after inbound or outbound communication takes place.  For example,

Internet-Draft              vCard Enumservice              November 2006


1.  Introduction

   E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) [1] uses the Domain Name System (DNS) [2]
   to refer from E.164 numbers [3] to Uniform Resource Identifiers
   (URIs) [7].  The registration process for Enumservices is described
   in section 3 of RFC 3761.

   "vCard" [5] is a transport independent data format for the exchange
   of information about an individual.  For the purpose of this
   document, the term "vCard" refers to a specific instance of this data
   format - an "electronic business card". vCards are exchanged via
   several protocols, most commonly they are distributed as electronic
   mail attachments or published on web servers.  Most popular personal
   information manager applications are capable of reading and writing
   vCards.

   In addition to the format specified in RFC 2426, 'Representing vCard
   Objects in RDF/XML' [4] specifies two alternative formats for
   representing vCard data, namely as RDF (Resource Description
   Framework) or "plain" XML documents.

   The Enumservice specified in this document deals with the relation
   between an E.164 number and vCards.  An ENUM record using this
   Enumservice identifies a resource from where a vCard corresponding to
   the respective E.164 number could be fetched.  Each subtype of the
   Enumservice corresponds to one of the vCard data formats mentioned
   above.

   Clients could use those resources to eg. automatically update local
   address books (a Voice over IP phone could try to fetch vCards for
   all outbound and inbound calls taking place on that phone and display
   them together with the call journal).  In a more integrated scenario,
   information gathered from those vCards could even be automatically
   incorporated into the personal information manager application of the
   respective user.

Internet-Draft              vCard Enumservice              November 2006


4.1.  Empty Subtype

   Enumservice Name: "vCard"

   Enumservice Type: "vcard"

   Enumservice Subtype: n/a

   URI Schemes: "http", "https"

   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is a plain
      vCard according to RFC 2426 which may be accessed using HTTP/HTTPS
      [8].
      Clients fetching the vCard from the resource indicated should
      expect access to be restricted.  Additionally, the comprehension
      of the data provided may vary depending on the client's identity.

   Security Considerations: see Section 6

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Author: Alexander Mayrhofer <mailto:alexander.mayrhofer@enum.at>

4.2.  "RDF" Subtype

   Enumservice Name: "vCard"

   Enumservice Type: "vcard"

   Enumservice Subtype: "rdf"

   URI Schemes: "http", "https"

   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is a RDF-
      formatted vCard according to section 3 - 5 of W3C vcard-rdf [4]
      which may be accessed using HTTP/HTTPS.
      Clients fetching the vCard from the resource indicated should
      expect access to be restricted.  Additionally, the comprehension
      of the data provided may vary depending on the client's identity.

   Security Considerations: see Section 6

   Intended Usage: COMMON

4.3.  "XML" Subtype

   Enumservice Name: "vCard"

   Enumservice Type: "vcard"

   Enumservice Subtype: "xml"

   URI Schemes: "http", "https"

   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is a XML-
      formatted vCard according to section 6 of W3C vcard-rdf [4] which
      may be accessed using HTTP/HTTPS.
      Clients fetching the vCard from the resource indicated should
      expect access to be restricted.  Additionally, the comprehension
      of the data provided may vary depending on the client's identity.

   Security Considerations: see Section 6

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Author: Alexander Mayrhofer <mailto:alexander.mayrhofer@enum.at>


5.  Example

   An example ENUM entry referencing to a plain vCard could look like:

      $ORIGIN 6.4.9.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
      @ IN NAPTR 100 10 "u" "E2U+vcard"
      "!^.*$!http://example.net/vcard.vcf!" .

   (Note: Due to line length constraints, the example record above is
   split in two lines)


6.  Security & Privacy Considerations

   As with any Enumservice, the security considerations of ENUM itself
   (Section 6 of RFC 3761) apply.

6.1.  The ENUM Record Itself

   Since ENUM uses DNS - a publicly available database - any information
   contained in records provisioned in ENUM domains must be considered
   public as well.  Even after revoking the DNS entry and removing the
   refered resource, copies of the information could still be available.

Internet-Draft              vCard Enumservice              November 2006


   Information published in ENUM records could reveal associations
   between E.164 numbers and their owners - especially if URIs contain
   personal identifiers or domain names for which ownership information
   can be obtained easily.  For example, the following URI makes it easy
   to guess the owner of an E.164 number as well as his location and
   association by just examining the result from the ENUM lookup:

      http://sandiego.company.example.com/joe-william-user.vcf

   However, it is important to note that the ENUM record itself does not
   need to contain any personal information.  It just points to a
   location where access to personal information could be granted.  For
   example, the following URI only reveals the service provider hosting
   the vCard (who probably even provides anonymous hosting):

      http://anonhoster.example.org/file_adfa001.vcf

   ENUM records pointing to third party resources can easily be
   provisioned on purpose by the ENUM domain owner - so any assumption
   about the association between a number and an entity could therefore
   be completely bogus unless some kind of identity verification is in
   place.  This verification is out of scope for this memo.

6.2.  The Resource Identified

   In most cases, vCards provide information about individuals.  Linking
   telephone numbers to such Personally Identifyable Information (PII)
   is a very sensitive topic, because it provides a "reverse lookup"
   from the number to its owner.  Publication of such PII is covered by
   data protection law in many legislations.  In most cases, the
   explicit consent of the affected individual is required.

   Users MUST therefore carefully consider information they provide in
   the resource identified by the ENUM record as well as in the record
   itself.  Considerations SHOULD include serving information only to
   entities of the user's choice and/or limiting the comprehension of
   the information provided based on the identity of the requestor.

   The use of HTTP in this Enumservice allows using builtin
   authentication and authorization mechanisms to be used to maintain
   access controls on vCards.  Most notable, Digest Authentication [9]
   could be used to challenge requestors, and even synthesize vCards
   based on the client's identity (or refuse access entirely).

   If access restrictions on the vCard resource are deployed, Standard
   HTTP authentication and authorization mechanisms as described in
   RFC2617 MUST be used to enforce those restrictions.  HTTPS SHOULD be
   preferred if the deployed mechanisms are prone to eavesdropping and

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests registration of multiple "vCard" Enumservices
   according to the templates in Section 4 of this document and the
   definitions in RFC 3761 [1].
