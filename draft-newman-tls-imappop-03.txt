Introduction

     The TLS protocol [TLS] (formerly known as SSL) provides a way to
     secure a connection from tampering and evesdropping.  Obviously,
     the option of using such security is desirable for IMAP [IMAP4],
     POP [POP3] and ACAP [ACAP].  Although advanced SASL [SASL]
     authentication mechanisms can provide a lightweight version of this
     service, TLS is a full service security layer and is also useful in
     combination with plaintext password logins and other simple
     mechanisms as it doesn't require a site to upgrade its
     authentication database.

     This specification defines extensions to IMAP4, ACAP and POP3 which
     activate TLS.  It also defines a set of server security policy
     response codes for use with IMAP4.  The response codes MAY be used
     independently of the TLS extension.  Finally, this defines a simple
     PLAIN SASL mechanism for use underneath strong TLS encryption with
     ACAP.

     [NOTE: Public discussion of this mechanism may take place on the

1. Conventions Used in this Document

     The key words "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
     NOT", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described
     in "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"
     [KEYWORDS].

     Formal syntax is defined using ABNF [ABNF].

     In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
     server respectively.


2. Cipher Suite Requirements

     This application profile of TLS follows the standard "Mandatory
     Cipher Suites" requirement as documented in the TLS specification
     [TLS].  Implementations MUST NOT assume any other cipher suites are
     present.


3. IMAP4 STARTTLS extension

     When the TLS extension is present in IMAP4, "STARTTLS" is listed as
     a capability in response to the CAPABILITY command.  This extension
     adds a single command, "STARTTLS" to the IMAP4 protocol which is
     used to begin a TLS negotiation.


3.1. STARTTLS Command

   Arguments:  none

   Responses:  no specific responses for this command

   Result:     OK - begin TLS negotiation
               NO - security layer already active
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      A TLS negotiation begins immediately after the CRLF at the end of
      the tagged OK response from the server.  The STARTTLS command MAY
      be used in any state.  However, a NO response MAY result if a
      security layer is already active.  Once a client issues a STARTTLS



Newman                                                          [Page 2]

Internet Draft    Using TLS with IMAP4, POP3 and ACAP         March 1998


      command, it MUST NOT issue further commands until a server
      response is seen.

      If STARTTLS is issued in non-authenticated state, the server
      remains in non-authenticated state, even if client credentials are
      supplied during the TLS negotiation.  The SASL [SASL] EXTERNAL
      mechanism MAY be used to authenticate once TLS client credentials
      are successfully exchanged, but servers supporting the STARTTLS
      command are not required to support the EXTERNAL mechanism.

      The formal syntax for IMAP4 is amended as follows:

        command_any   =/  "STARTTLS"

   Example:    C: a001 CAPABILITY
               S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 STARTTLS
               S: a001 OK CAPABILITY completed
               C: a002 STARTTLS
               S: a002 OK Begin TLS negotiation now
               <TLS negotation, further commands are under TLS layer>
               C: a003 LOGIN joe password
               S: a003 OK LOGIN completed

4. POP3 STLS extension

   The POP3 STLS extension adds the STLS command to POP3 servers.  If
   this is implemented, the POP3 extension mechanism [POP3EXT] MUST also
   be implemented to avoid the need for client probing of multiple
   commands.  The capability name "STLS" indicates this command is
   present.

      STLS

         Arguments: none

         Restrictions:
             MAY be given in any state, but MAY fail if a security layer
             is already active.

         Discussion:
             A TLS negotiation begins immediately after the CRLF at the
             end of the +OK response from the server.  A -ERR response
             MAY result if a security layer is already active.  Once a
             client issues a STLS command, it MUST NOT issue further
             commands until a server response is seen.

             If STLS is issued in authorization state, the server
             remains in authorization state, even if client credentials



Newman                                                          [Page 3]

             are supplied during the TLS negotiation.  The AUTH command
             [POP3-AUTH] with the EXTERNAL mechanism [SASL] MAY be used
             to authenticate once TLS client credentials are
             successfully exchanged, but servers supporting the STLS
             command are not required to support the EXTERNAL mechanism.

         Possible Responses:
             +OK -ERR

         Examples:
             C: STLS
             S: +OK Begin TLS negotiation
             <TLS negotiation, further commands are under TLS layer>
               ...
             C: STLS
             S: -ERR Security Layer already active

5. ACAP STARTTLS extension

     When the TLS extension is present in ACAP, "STARTTLS" is listed as
     a capability in the ACAP greeting.  No arguments to this capability
     are defined at this time.  This extension adds a single command,
     "STARTTLS" to the ACAP protocol which is used to begin a TLS
     negotiation.


5.1. STARTTLS Command

   Arguments:  none

   Responses:  no specific responses for this command

   Result:     OK - begin TLS negotiation
               NO - security layer already active
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      A TLS negotiation begins immediately after the CRLF at the end of
      the tagged OK response from the server.  The STARTTLS command MAY
      be used in any state.  However, a NO response MAY result if a
      security layer is already active.  Once a client issues a STARTTLS
      command, it MUST NOT issue further commands until a server
      response is seen.

      If STARTTLS is issued in non-authenticated state, the server
      remains in non-authenticated state, even if client credentials are
      supplied during the TLS negotiation.  The SASL [SASL] EXTERNAL
      mechanism MAY be used to authenticate once TLS client credentials
      are successfully exchanged, but servers supporting the STARTTLS



Newman                                                          [Page 4]

Internet Draft    Using TLS with IMAP4, POP3 and ACAP         March 1998


      command are not required to support the EXTERNAL mechanism.

      The formal syntax for ACAP is amended as follows:

        command_any   =/  "STARTTLS"

   Example:    S: * ACAP (SASL "CRAM-MD5" "PLAIN" "EXTERNAL")
                  (STARTTLS)
               C: a002 STARTTLS
               S: a002 OK "Begin TLS negotiation now"
               <TLS negotation, further commands are under TLS layer>

6. PLAIN SASL mechanism

     Plaintext passwords are simple, interoperate with almost all
     existing operating system authentication databases, and are useful
     for a smooth transition to a more secure password-based
     authentication mechanism.  The drawback is that they are
     unacceptable for use unencrypted over the network.

     This defines a PLAIN SASL mechanism for use with ACAP and future
     protocols with no plaintext login command.  This MUST NOT be
     implemented unless TLS (or an equivalent security layer) is also
     implemented.

     The SASL [SASL] mechanism name is "PLAIN".

     The mechanism consists of a single message from the client to the
     server.  The client sends the authorization identity (identity to
     login as), followed by a US-ASCII NUL character, followed by the
     authentication identity (identity whose password will be used),
     followed by a US-ASCII NUL character, followed by the plaintext
     password.  The client may leave the authorization identity empty to
     indicate that it is the same as the authentication identity.

     The server will verify the authentication identity and password
     with the system authentication database and verify that the
     authentication credentials permit the client to login as the
     authorization identity.  If both steps succeed, the user is logged
     in.

     The server MAY also use the password to initialize any new
     authentication database, such as one suitable for CRAM-MD5
     [CRAM-MD5], ACAP's mandatory to implement authentication mechanism.

     Non-US-ASCII characters are permitted as long as they are
     represented in UTF-8 [UTF-8].  Use of non-visible characters or
     characters which a user may be unable to enter on some keyboards is



Newman                                                          [Page 5]

     discouraged.

     The formal grammar for the client message using Augmented BNF
     [ABNF] follows.

     message         = [authorize-id] NUL authenticate-id NUL password

     authenticate-id = 1*UTF8-SAFE
                       ; MUST accept up to 255 octets

     authorize-id    = 1*UTF8-SAFE
                       ; MUST accept up to 255 octets

     password        = *UTF8-SAFE
                       ; MUST accept passwords up to 255 octets

     NUL             = %x00

     UTF8-SAFE       = %x01-09 / %x0B-0C / %x0E-7F / UTF8-2 /
                       UTF8-3 / UTF8-4 / UTF8-5 / UTF8-6

     UTF8-1          = %x80-BF

     UTF8-2          = %xC0-DF UTF8-1

     UTF8-3          = %xE0-EF 2UTF8-1

     UTF8-4          = %xF0-F7 3UTF8-1

     UTF8-5          = %xF8-FB 4UTF8-1

     UTF8-6          = %xFC-FD 5UTF8-1

     Here is an example of how this might be used to initialize a
     CRAM-MD5 authentication database for ACAP:

     Example:    S: * ACAP (SASL "CRAM-MD5" "PLAIN" "EXTERNAL")
                    (STARTTLS)
                 C: a001 AUTHENTICATE "CRAM-MD5"
                 S: + "<1896.697170952@postoffice.reston.mci.net>"
                 C: "tim b913a602c7eda7a495b4e6e7334d3890"
                 S: a001 NO (TRANSITION-NEEDED)
                    "Please change your password, or use TLS to login"
                 C: a002 STARTTLS
                 S: a002 OK "Begin TLS negotiation now"
                 <TLS negotation, further commands are under TLS layer>
                 C: a003 AUTHENTICATE "PLAIN" {21+}
                 C: <NUL>tim<NUL>tanstaaftanstaaf



Newman                                                          [Page 6]

Internet Draft    Using TLS with IMAP4, POP3 and ACAP         March 1998


                 S: a003 OK AUTHENTICATE completed

     Note: In this example, <NUL> represents a single ASCII NUL octet.

     Here is an example session where a client erroneously attempts to
     use PLAIN prior to starting TLS:

     Example:    S: * ACAP (SASL "CRAM-MD5" "PLAIN" "EXTERNAL")
                    (STARTTLS)
                 C: a001 AUTHENTICATE "PLAIN" {21}
                 S: a001 NO (ENCRYPT-NEEDED)
                    "Can't use PLAIN without encryption"


7. imaps and pop3s ports

     The common practice of using a separate port for a secure version
     of each protocol has a number of disadvantages in the IMAP [IMAP4],
     ACAP [ACAP] and POP [POP3] environment.  Rather than using the best
     security available, it means that clients have to be explicitly
     configured to use the separate secure port or suffer the
     performance loss of probing for active ports.  For IMAP and ACAP,
     this is even more serious as it would require a new URL scheme
     which could only be resolved by TLS-enabled clients.

     Separate "imaps" and "pop3s" ports were registered for use with
     TLS.  Use of these ports is discouraged in favor of the STARTTLS or
     STLS command.

     One of the arguments used in favor of the separate port technique
     is that it simplifies configuration of firewalls which filter by IP
     port.  However, a quality server implementation running on the
     standard port can be configured to require use of the STARTTLS
     command or a suitably strong SASL mechanism for non-local
     connections.  This provides superior functionality as the client
     need not be re-configured for use outside the firewall and faster
     non-plaintext SASL mechanisms may be acceptable to many sites for
     non-local connections.


8. Security Considerations

     The mechanisms described in this document only apply to protecting
     a single connection.  Messages transferred over IMAP or POP3 are
     still available to server administrators and usually subject to
     evesdropping, tampering and forgery when transmitted through SMTP
     or NNTP.  Protecting messages requires an object security mechanism
     such as PGP MIME [PGP-MIME].



Newman                                                          [Page 7]

Internet Draft    Using TLS with IMAP4, POP3 and ACAP         March 1998


     An active attacker can remove STARTTLS from the capability list.
     In order to detect such an attack, clients SHOULD either warn the
     user when session protection is not active, or be configurable to
     refuse to proceed without an acceptable level of security.

     An active attacker can always cause a down-negotiation to the
     weakest authentication mechanism or cipher suite available.  For
     this reason, implementations need to be configurable to refuse weak
     mechanisms or cipher suites.

     When the PLAIN mechanism is used with TLS, the server gains the
     ability to impersonate the user to all services with the same
     password.  The PLAIN mechanism MUST NOT be used without an active
     encryption layer using a key with an effective key length greater
     than 56 bits, otherwise a passive attacker can gain the ability to
     impersonate the user.
