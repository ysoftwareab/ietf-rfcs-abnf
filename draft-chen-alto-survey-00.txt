1.  Introduction

1.1.  ALTO Background

   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol [RFC7285]
   is a client/server protocol operating between an ALTO client and an
   ALTO server.  An ALTO server provides network related information to
   ALTO clients so that ALTO clients can make better decisions.  ALTO is
   initially proposed to help distributed applications (P2P and client/
   server used for file sharing, real-time communication, etc.) to
   choose a better resource from multiple replicas.  Recently, as new
   use cases like Content Delivery Network (CDN), Software-Define
   Network (SDN) and Datacenter Network (DCN) in single and multi domain
   environments emerge to utilize ALTO, they will bring forth new
   requirements and challenges on ALTO protocol.

1.2.  Goals and Scope

   This document aims to provide a comprehensive survey of ALTO, it
   covers: 1) ALTO implementations in different companies/institutions;
   2) Application scenarios of ALTO in literature work through a lot of
   paper reading.  With the survey of above topics, we want to explore:
   1) The system architecture of ALTO implementation and possible issues
   in realizing the system; 2) Current use cases and future uses cases
   of ALTO; 3) Possible ALTO extensions to support future use cases.

1.3.  Document Organization

   The document is organized as below:

   In Section 2, we present the survey of ALTO implementation and its
   results.  In Section 3, we collect ALTO use cases in literature work
   and classified them based on ??? criteria.  Finally, based on the
   ALTO use cases in literature work, we will show possible ALTO
   extensions and research opportunities of ALTO in Section 4.

   o  CM: cost map

   o  FM: filtered map

   o  MC: multi-cost

   o  CC: cost calendar

   o  PV: path vector

   o  SDMN: software defined mobile networks

2.2.  ALTO in Software Defined Mobile Networks

   ALTO in software defined mobile networks (SDMN) project is a sub-
   project of Celtic-Plus SIGMONA, and it is implemented by Budapest
   University of Technology and Economics.

   As the elasticity and portability of network functions becomes
   reality, the significance of service endpoint selection increases.
   ALTO is a standard protocol, which can provide guidance in service
   endpoint selection.  So ALTO is very suitable for this case.

   This project has implemented network map and cost map, and it
   introduced two new interfaces namely ALTO client-to-redirect server
   interface and ALTO network-to-server interface.

   For cost calculation, this project regarded the number of switches
   between end hosts as "num-routing" and the average utilization of the
   path in the last 5 seconds as "num-delay".

   The ALTO server in this project is standalone, and the ALTO client in
   this project is embedded into a SDN controller.

2.3.  Recognized Issues and Future Work

   Extension of dynamic network and cost map information provision:

   o  From non-SDN network segments

   o  From multiple network controllers (merging information in ALTO
      server)

   ALTO protocol applies abstract network and cost maps:

   o  Pros: privacy of topology information

   o  Cons: sometimes not enough fine grained

Internet-Draft                 ALTO Survey                     July 2018


3.1.  Peer Selection

3.1.1.  Peer Selection in P2P

3.1.1.1.  Usage Scenario

   Without little knowledge of the underlying network informtion, users
   in P2P system retrieve data from a random peer.  Such a random peer
   selection mechanism have some disadvantages: 1.  It causes an extra
   burden in the internet traffic. 2.  It reduces the system
   performance.

3.1.2.  Surrogate Selection in CDN

   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) have been used to deliver some
   Internet services such as video stream, websites or software updates
   because they provide numerous benefits including reduced delivery
   cost for cacheable content, improved QoS for end users and increased
   robustness of delivery.

   The primary use case for ALTO in a CDN context is to improve the
   selection of a surrogate, cache or origin.  By providing cost maps
   and network maps, ALTO can help a CDN to optimize selection of its
   surrogate, cache or origin.

3.1.3.  Downstream CDN Selection in CDNI

   Above section mainly talks about the surrogate selection in the CDN
   from a single administrative domain.  However, some CDNs from
   different administrative domains may collaborate together to provide
   a broader coverage area.  In such case, an upstream CDN needs to
   select the best downstream CDN For each content request it intends to
   redirect.

   There are two tasks need to be done when an upstream CDN selects a
   downstream CDN.  The first one is which dCDN is willing to accept a
   delegated request, and the second one is which dCDN is the most
   proper for redirecting the content request.  For the first task, ALTO
   CDNI FCI Map can be used by uCDN to actively or passively gather
   dCDNs information such as footprints.  For the second task, ALTO cost
   map can be used by uCDN to select the best surrogate with the
   smallest cost.

3.1.4.  Cache Selection in Hybrid CDN-P2P System

   Hybrid CDN-P2P system propose a two-tier topologies.  The first level
   (CDN-L1) is composed by high capacity servers strategically placed in
   order to increase network backbone capacity.  A second level (CDN-L0)



Chen, et al.             Expires January 3, 2019                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                 ALTO Survey                     July 2018


   consists of Level-0 Entry Point (L0-EP).  These node are equipped
   with some caching functionalities and placed geographically closer to
   end users.  The L0-EP includes a standard HTTP proxy frontend used to
   optimally redirect the HTTP GET requests of the users to the best
   content location in CDN-L0 or CDN-L1.  The decision logic module
   residing in L0-EP considers 3 factors (the availability of the
   content in the L0-EP local cache, the list of cache nodes that can
   contribute to retrieve the content and the locality awareness) to
   make its final decision.

   The locality information here is provided through ALTO interface from
   the network monitors.

3.1.5.  Mobile Edge Caching

3.1.5.1.  Usage Scenario

   Mobile Edge Caching is regarded to be possible to reduce the latency
   for users to retrieve content, thus improving the perveived Quality
   of Experience.  The main technique in mobile edge caching is to equip
   edge network elements with cache capabilities.  Popular contents can
   be stored at several caching servers at edge.

3.1.5.2.  Applicability of ALTO

   In the context of mobile edge caching, the information that a User
   Equipment (UE) tries to access, such as a document or a video, is
   referred to a s a Named Data Object (NDO).  [MEC] proposes that ALTO
   can perform like a DNS server.  It can be used to discover the
   caching servers that host the desired resource . To leverage ALTO for
   resource discovery, ALTO will regard each resource a PID.  The IP
   addresses that a PID contains are the caching servers holding
   specific NDO.  As response to the ALTO query, ALTO server will return
   a network map with a list of PIDs, each with IP addresses of cache
   servers.  Such discovery mechanism allows the operator to inform the
   UE about all the cache servers that contain the required NDO in
   single operation.  Second, the UE can use additional ALTO features
   (such as cost maps) to inquire which cache-server is preferred in
   terms of data routing costs (i.e., availble bandwidth, network load
   and others).

3.2.  Path Selection

3.2.1.  Path Selection in MPTS-AR

3.3.  Resource Placement

3.3.1.  Virtualized Service Function Chain Placement

3.3.2.  Intelligent Virtual Machine Placement

3.3.2.1.  Usage Scenario

   The cloud management system can optimize resource placement by taking
   into account the network performance as well as the compute and
   storage resources.

3.3.2.2.  Applicability of ALTO

3.3.2.3.  Challenges and Opportunities

3.3.3.  Service Placement in IoT

3.3.3.1.  Usage Scenario

   With the cutting-edge paradigms like Internet of Things and Smart
   Cities develop, new services have special requirements, one of which
   is low latency levels.  A delayed reply could render to chaos for
   applications such as eHealth and public safety.  One of the solutions
   is a smart service placement system that facilitates the location of
   services in the proper position according to specific needs.
   Locating the services just on wireless hop away from the users is not
   as simple as it sounds, since the service could be wrongfully placed
   in a congested location, or even farther from the users, which would
   lead to a greater latency.  Thus, efficient service placement
   mechanisms are needed in order to take advantage of the current
   conditions of the network while minimizing the service latency.

3.3.3.2.  Applicability of ALTO

3.3.3.3.  Challenges of ALTO/ Opportunities of ALTO

3.4.  Measure Results Interface

3.4.1.  An Interface to Query on the LMAP measure results

   In the context of LMAP, measurement results are made available to the
   public either at the finest granularity level, or in a very high
   level human-readable format.  ALTO can provide an intermediate way to
   access large-scale network measurement result, and it can be used to
   tweak the aggregation-level of measurement results.

Internet-Draft                 ALTO Survey                     July 2018


   Controller sends instructions to measurement agent to do the
   measurement.  And then measurement result will be transferred to the
   collector by report protocol.  Just providing finest granularity
   level or providing a very high level human-readable format are not
   enough.  ALTO can provide an intermediate way to access large-scale
   network measurement result, and it can be used to tweak the
   aggregation-level of measurement results.

4.  Challenges and Research Opportunities

4.1.  Possible New Address Format

   Some scenarios may require new address format.

4.2.  Mistrust between entities

   Application developers and network operators are natural mistrust,
   with both parties reluctant to share what they consider sensitive
   information.

4.3.  Bidirectional Network/Application collaboration

   ALTO is originally designed to provide network information to
   applications so that applications can achieve better performance
   while the cost of the network can be reduced.  Exposing non-critical
   information from application providers to network providers may
   potentially bring more benefits.  A paper named "Bidirectional
   Network Collaboration Interface for CDNs and Clouds Services Traffic
   Optimization" describes this idea, and it proposes the constraint map
   which provides application needs and constraints to network
   providers.
