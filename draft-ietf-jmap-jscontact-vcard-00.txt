1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The JSContact specification [draft-ietf-jmap-jscontact] has been
   defined to represent contact card information as a more efficient
   alternative to vCard [RFC6350] and its JSON-based version named jCard
   [RFC7095].

   While new applications might adopt JSContact as their main format to
   exchange contact card data, they are likely to interoperate with
   services and clients that just support vCard/jCard.  Similarly,
   existing contact data providers and consumers already using vCard/
   jCard might want to represent their data also according to the
   JSContact specification.

   To facilitate this use cases, this document provides informational
   guidance about how to convert the card defined in JSContact, namely
   JSCard, from and to vCard.

1.2.  Scope and Caveats

   JSContact and vCard have a lot of semantics in common, however some
   differences must be outlined:

   o  The JSContact data model defines some contact information that
      doesn't have a direct mapping with vCard elements.  In particular,

Internet-Draft               jscontact-vcard                   July 2020


      unlike vCard, JSContact distinguishes between a single contact
      card, named JSCard, and a group of contact cards, named
      JSCardGroup.

   o  The vCard specification includes some features (like parameters)
      that have been formally removed from JSCard due to a complete
      refactoring of vCard content.  Anyway, the vCard parameters may
      appear as JSCard features.

   o  Some vCard elements represented individually have been mapped onto
      members of JSCard objects.

   o  The vCard custom elements, identified by the prefix "x-", don't
      have a direct counterpart in the JSContact specification.

1.3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Mapping

   This section contains the mapping between vCard and JSCard.  The
   vCard properties are grouped according to the categories defined by
   [RFC6350].

   Where it is needed, the JCardGroup is taken into account.

   In the following of this document, the vCard features, namely
   properties and parameters, are written in uppercase while the JSCard
   features are written in camel case.

2.1.  General Properties

2.1.1.  BEGIN and END

   The BEGIN and END properties don't have a direct match with a JSCard
   feature.

2.1.2.  SOURCE

   A SOURCE element is represented as a "Resource" object in the
   "online" array (Figure 1) whose "type" member is set to "uri" and
   "labels" map contains the entry <"source",true>.

   The PREF and MEDIATYPE parameters are mapped onto the "isPreferred"
   and "mediaType" members respectively.

2.1.3.  KIND

   The KIND element is mapped onto the "kind" member (Figure 2).
   Allowed values are those, except "group", described in section 6.1.4
   of [RFC6350] and extended with the values declared in [RFC6473] and
   [RFC6869].  A group of cards is represented through a JSCardGroup.

2.1.4.  XML

   The XML property doesn't have a direct match with a JSCard feature.

2.2.  Identification Properties

2.2.1.  FN

   All the FN elements are globally represented through the "fullName"
   member.  The presence of more than one name is implicitly associated
   with the full name translations in various languages regardless of
   the presence of the ALTID parameter.  Each translation corresponds to
   a different entry of the "localizations" map (Figure 3).

2.2.2.  N and NICKNAME

   Both the N and NICKNAME elements are converted into equivalent items
   of the "name" array (Figure 3):

   o  the N components are transformed into related "NameComponent"
      objects as reported in Table 1.  Name components SHOULD be ordered
      such that their values joined by whitespace produce a valid full
      name of this entity;

   o  Each NICKNAME element is mapped onto an object whose "type" member
      is set to "nickname"

                   +--------------------+--------------+
                   | N component        | "type" value |
                   +--------------------+--------------+
                   | Honorific Prefixes | prefix       |
                   | Given Names        | personal     |
                   | Family Names       | surname      |
                   | Additional Names   | additional   |
                   | Honorific Suffixes | suffix       |

2.2.3.  PHOTO

   A PHOTO element is represented as a "Resource" object in the "online"
   array (Figure 4) whose "type" member is set to "uri" and "labels" map
   contains the entry <"photo",true>.

   The PREF and MEDIATYPE parameters are mapped onto the "isPreferred"
   and "mediaType" members respectively.

    }

                      Figure 4: PHOTO mapping example

2.2.4.  BDAY, BIRTHPLACE, DEATHDATE, DEATHPLACE, ANNIVERSARY

   The BDAY and ANNIVERSARY elements and the extensions BIRTHPLACE,
   DEATHDATE, DEATHPLACE described in [RFC6350] are represented as
   "Anniversary" objects included in the "anniversaries" array
   (Figure 5):

   o  BDAY and BIRTHPLACE are mapped onto "date" and "place" where
      "type" is set to "birth";

   o  DEATHDATE and DEATHPLACE are mapped onto "date" and "place" where
      "type" is set to "death";

   o  ANNIVERSARY is mapped onto "date" where "type" is set to "other"
      and "label" is set to a value describing in detail the kind of
      anniversary (e.g. "marriage date" for the wedding anniversary).

   Both birth and death places are represented as instances of the
   "Address" object.  BIRTHPLACE and DEATHPLACE that are represented as
   geo URIs are converted into "Address" instances including only the
   "coordinates" member.  If the URI value is not a geo URI, the place
   is ignored.  The LANGUAGE parameter values of both BIRTHPLACE and
   DEATHPLACE elements are represented as corresponding entries of the
   "fullAddress.localizations" map.

   The LABEL parameter is converted into the "fullAddress" member.

   The PREF parameter is converted into the "isPreferred" member.

   The GEO parameter is converted into the "coordinates" member.

   The TZ parameter is converted into by the "timeZone" member.

   The TYPE parameter is converted into the "context" member.  The
   "home" value is replaced with the "private" value.

   The LANGUAGE parameter values are represented as different entries of
   the "fullAddress.localizations" map.

   The CC parameter defined by [RFC8605] is converted into the
   "countryCode" member.

2.4.1.  TEL

   A TEL element is represented as a "Resource" object in the "phones"
   array (Figure 7).  The vCard "type-param-tel" values are mapped onto
   the "type" member values.  Those vCard "type-param-tel" values that
   don't have a counterpart among the "type" member values are
   represented as entry keys of the "labels" map with the corresponding
   entry value set to true.  The "type-param" values are are mapped onto
   the "context" member values.  The "home" value is replaced with the
   "private" value.

   The PREF parameter is mapped onto the "isPreferred" member.

2.4.3.  IMPP

   An IMPP element is represented as a "Resource" object in the "online"
   array (Figure 9) whose "type" member is set to "username" and
   "labels" map contains the entry <"XMPP",true>.

   In case of a contact card related to an acconunt on another online
   service, the entry key SHOULD be the canonical service name,
   including capitalisation (e.g.  "Twitter", "Facebook", "Skype",
   "GitHub")

   The PREF and MEDIATYPE parameters are mapped onto the "isPreferred"
   and "mediaType" members respectively.

2.4.4.  LANG

   A LANG element is represented through the "preferredContactLanguages"
   map (Figure 10): an entry for each language that may be used for
   contacting the entity associated with the JSCard.  The entry keys
   correspond to the language tags, the corresponding entry values are
   arrays of "ContactLanguage" objects.

   The TYPE and PREF parameters are mapped onto the "ContactLanguage"
   members "type" and "preference" respectively.

   If both PREF and TYPE parameters are missing, the array of
   "ContactLanguage" objects MUST be empty.

2.5.  Geographical Properties

   The GEO and TZ elements are not directly mapped into equivalent
   topmost JSCard members because the same information is represented
   through equivalent "Address" members.

   The ALTID parameter is used for associating both GEO and TZ elements
   with the related address information.  When the ALTID parameter is
   missing, the element should be associated with the first contact
   address.

   A CALADRURI element is represented as a "Resource" object of the
   "online" array (Figure 31) whose "type" member is set to "uri" and
   "labels" map contains the entry <"caladruri",true>.

   The PREF and MEDIATYPE parameters are mapped onto the "isPreferred"
   and "mediaType" members respectively.

2.11.  Additional Clarifications about Mapping

2.11.1.  Media type

   As described in section 5.7 of [RFC6350], the media type of a
   resource can be identified by its URI.  For example, "image/gif" can
   be derived from the ".gif" extension of a GIF image URI.  JSContact
   producers MAY provide the media type information even when it is not
   specified in the vCard.

2.11.2.  Timezone

   As specified in section 6.5.1 of [RFC6350], the time zone information
   can be represented in three ways: as a time zone name, as an UTC
   offset or as an URI.

   o  The time zone name is directly matched by the "timeZone" member in
      JSContact.

   o  An UTC offset MUST be converted into the related "Etc/GMT" time
      zone (e.g. the value "-0500" converts to "Etc/GMT+5").  If the UTC
      offset value contains minutes information, it MUST be mapped to
      map it to the zone "Etc/GMT<sign><hour>:<minute>".

   o  Since there is no URI scheme defined for time zones [uri-schemes],
      any implementation that does use some a custom URI for a time zone
      is not interoperable anyway.  In this case, if the URI corresponds
      to an a IANA time zone [time-zones], this latter SHOULD be used.
      Otherwise, the URI value is dumped into a string.

2.12.  Extended Properties

   If an extended property is a resource, JSCard already allows to
   represent it by setting the "type" member to "other" and specifying a
   value for the "labels" map.

   Any other property supporting a custom feature MAY be added and its
   name MUST be prefixed with a specific domain name to avoid conflict,
   e.g. "example.com/customprop".

2.13.  vCard Unmatched Properties

   Any vCard property or parameter that doesn't have a direct
   counterpart in JSContact is treated as an extended property.  The
   following mapping rules MUST be applied:

   o  an unmatched property is converted into an extended property whose
      name is prefixed by "ietf.org/rfc6350/"

   o  an unmatched parameter is converted into an extended property
      whose name is prefixed by "ietf.org/rfc6350/<vCard property>/"

   In both cases, the resulting names MUST be in lowercase.

2.14.  JSCard Required Properties

   While converting a vCard into a JSCard, only the topmost "uid" member
   is required.

2.15.  JSCard Unmatched Properties

   The "preferredContactMethod" member doesn't match any vCard element.
