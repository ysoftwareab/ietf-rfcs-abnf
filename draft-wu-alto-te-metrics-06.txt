                 ALTO Traffic Engineering Cost Metrics
                      draft-wu-alto-te-metrics-06

Abstract

   Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the
   Endpoint Cost Service.  Future extensions to ALTO may also use Cost
   Metric.

   Different applications may benefit from different Cost Metrics.  For
   example, a Resource Consumer may prefer Resource Providers that have
   low delay to the Resource Consumer.  However the base ALTO protocol
   [ALTO] has defined only a single cost metric, i.e., the generic
   "routingcost" metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base specification [ALTO]).

   In this document, we define eleven Cost Metrics, derived from OSPF-TE
   and ISIS-TE, to measure network delay, jitter, packet loss, hop
   count, and bandwidth.  The metrics defined in this document provide a
   relatively comprehensive set of Cost Metrics for ALTO focusing on
   traffic engineering (TE).  Additional Cost Metrics such as financial
   cost metrics may be defined in other documents.

   Requirements Language The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the
   Endpoint Cost Service.  In particular, applications may benefit from
   knowing network performance measured on several Cost Metrics.  For
   example, a more delay sensitive application may focus on latency, and
   a more bandwidth-sensitive application may focus on available
   bandwidth.

   The objective of this document is to define eleven cost metrics,
   listed in Table 1, to support the aforementioned applications.
   Hence, this document extends the base ALTO protocol [ALTO], which
   defines only a single cost metric, i.e., the generic "routingcost"
   metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base specification [ALTO]).

   An ALTO server may provide a subset of the cost metrics defined in
   this document.  When an ALTO server supports a cost metric defined in
   this document, the server SHOULD announce the metric in its IRD.

   The definitions of a set of cost metrics can allow us to extend the
   ALTO base protocol (e.g., allowing output and constraints use
   different cost metrics), but such extensions are not in the scope of
   this document.

   One challenge in defining the metrics is that performance metrics
   often depend on configuration parameters.  For example, the value of
   packet loss rate depends on the measurement interval and varies over
   time.  To handle this issue, ALTO server may collect data on time
   periods covering the past, present or only collect data on present
   time.

   Following the ALTO base protocol, this document uses JSON to specify
   the value type of each defined metric.  See [RFC4627] for JSON data
   type specification.

2.  Data sources, computation of defined cost metrics

   The cost metrics defined in this document are similar, in that they
   may use similar data sources and have similar issues in their
   calculation.  Hence, instead of specifying such issues for each
   metric individually, we specify the common issue in this section.

2.1.  Data sources

   An ALTO server needs data sources to compute the cost metrics defined
   in this document.  This document does not define the exact data
   sources.  For example, the ALTO server may use log servers or the OAM
   system as its data source [ALTO-DEPLOYMENT].  In particular, the cost
   metrics defined in this document can be computed using routing
   systems as the data sources.  Mechanisms defined in [RFC3630],
   [RFC3784], [OSPF-TE], [ISIS-TE], [BGP-LS] and [BGP-PM] that allow an
   ALTO Server to retrieve and derive the necessary information to
   compute the metrics that we define in this document.

2.2.  Computation of metrics

   An ALTO server process measurements from data sources to compute
   exposed metrics.  It may need performance data processing tasks such
   as aggregating the results across multiple systems, removing
   outliers, and creating additional statistics.

   One specific challenge in defining the metrics in this document is
   that these performance metrics depend on some configuration
   parameters.  For example, the value of packet loss rate depends on
   the measurement interval and varies over time.  If the ALTO server
   uses aforementioned routing protocol based mechanisms as data
   sources, then the measurement interval may be preconfigured by the
   routing protocol.  For example, Section 5 of [ISIS-TE] defines a
   default measurement interval of 30 seconds.  This document uses the
   term Measurement Interval to refer to the measurement interval used
   by the data sources.  The Measurement Interval(s) of the data sources
   can be different from the interval that this document defines the
   metric.  Hence, an ALTO server needs to resolve the mismatch, when it
   happens.  [TODO: Need more specification.]

   Another issue of converting from data source measurements to ALTO
   exposed metric values is that the measurement results that the ALTO
   Server retrieves may be defined for only links, and hence, the server
   will need to compose the link metrics to obtain path metrics used in

   services such as the Cost Map Service.  In this definition, we define
   the metrics to be independent of link or path, considering that
   future ALTO extensions may define link-based services, and hence the
   defined metrics should still be usable.

3.  Cost Metric: Delay

   Metric name:

      Delay


   Metric Description:

      To specify spatial and temporal aggregated delay between the
      specified source and destination or the time that the packet
      spends to travel from source to destination.  The spatial
      aggregation unit is specified in the query context (e.g., PID to
      PID, or endpoint to endpoint); and the temporal unit is specified
      as the measurement interval in the query context.


   Method of Measurement or Calculation:

      See section 2.2, Computation of metrics.


   Units of Measurement:

      The unit is microsecond.


   Measurement Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain:

      See section 2.1, Data sources.


   Measurement Timing:

      See section 2.1, second paragraph for Measurement Timing.


   Use and Applications:

      This is intended to be a constraint attribute value.  A Cost Mode
      is encoded as a US-ASCII string.  The Metric value Type is a
      single 'JSONNumber' type value containing a non-negative integer
      component that may be followed by an exponent part.

      This metric could be used as a cost metric constraint attribute
      used either together with cost metric attribute 'routingcost' or
      on its own or as a returned cost metric in the response.

      To specify spatial and temporal aggregated bandwidth over the
      specified source and destination.  The spatial aggregation unit is
      specified in the query context (e.g., PID to PID, or endhost to
      endhost); and the temporal unit is specified as the measurement
      interval in the query context.

      This is just a definition of a class of cost metric 'bandwidth'.
      The use of this cost metric is always in conjunction with what it
      represents, which could be Max Bandwidth (maxbw), Residual
      Bandwidth (residuebw) etc.


   Method of Measurement or Calculation:

      See section 2.2, Computation of metrics.


   Units of Measurement:

      The units are bytes per second.

14.  Security Considerations

   The properties defined in this document present no security
   considerations beyond those in Section 15 of the base ALTO
   specification [ALTO].

   However concerns addressed in Sections "15.1 Authenticity and
   Integrity of ALTO Information", "15.2 Potential Undesirable Guidance



Wu, et al.              Expires October 31, 2015               [Page 25]

   from Authenticated ALTO Information" and "15.3 Confidentiality of
   ALTO Information" remain of utmost importance.  Indeed, TE
   performance is a highly sensitive ISP information and sharing TE
   metric values in numerical mode requires full mutual confidence
   between the entities managing the ALTO Server and Client.  Numerical
   TE performance information will most likely be distributed by ALTO
   Servers to Clients under strict and formal mutual trust agreements.
   One the other hand, ALTO Clients must be cognizant on the risks
   attached to such information that they would have acquired outside
   formal conditions of mutual trust.

15.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has added the following entries to the ALTO cost map Properties
   registry, defined in Section 3 of [RFCXXX].
