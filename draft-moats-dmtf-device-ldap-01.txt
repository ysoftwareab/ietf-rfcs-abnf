Abstract

   This draft presents a LDAP schema for the DMTF CIM Device model [7].

1. Introduction

   This draft presents a LDAPv3 [1,2] schema for the DMTF CIM Device
   model.  It builds on the core model presented in [3].  Associations
   are mapped using a combination of auxiliary classes and DIT structure
   rules.  Where auxiliary classes are used, name form and DIT content
   rules are specified.

   This document is not a product of the DMTF, and represents the view
   of the authors.

2. LDAP Mapping Considerations

2.1 Differences Between this Mapping and the CIM Device Model

   Certain objects in the CIM Device model have not been represented in
   this schema.  The classes IRQ, MemoryMappedIO, and DMA are not
   included because they do not make sense for storage in a directory.
   Therefore, the associations ComputerSystemIRQ,
   ComputerSystemMappedIO, ComputerSystemDMA, and AllocatedDMA are also
   not included.

   The objects and associations VideoBIOSFeature, VideoBIOSElement, and
   VideoBIOSFeatureVideoBIOSElement are not included.

   PrintQueue and PrintJob are not included because of their inherent
   dynamics.  This results in the associations PrinterServicingQueue,
   QueueForPrintService, QueueForwardsToPrintSAP, PrinterServicingJob,
   PrintJobFile, and OwningPrintQueue not being included.

   All of the sensor classes (BinarySensor, MultiStateSensor,
   DiscreteSensor, NumericSensor, TempatureSensor, CurrentSensor,
   VoltageSensor, Tachometer) were deemed too dynamic for a directory.
   Therefore, the associations CollectionOfSensors,
   AssociatedSupplyVoltageSensor, and AssociatedSupplyCurrentSensor are
   also not included.

   Because FCAdapterEventCounters and FibrePortEventCounters have
   nothing but counters in them, they are not included in the schema.
   Further, because USBDevice claims to be only management, it is not
   included in this schema and so USBHub, USBPortOnHub,
   USBControllerHasHub, and USBConnection are not included.

   Processor and ComputerSystemProcessor are not included because they
   do not make sense in a directory.  The StorageExtent-related classes
   and media transfer classes (including LabelReader) were not included
   for similar reasons.

2.2 Changes to cimAssociationInstance

   The core mapping [3] defined cimAssociationInstance as a helper
   class.  To support the auxiliary classes, the following classes
   should be added to cimAssociationInstance's content rule:

      cim22DeviceConnectionAuxClass
      cim22DeviceIdentityAuxClass
      cim22ComputerSystemResourceAuxClass
      cim22AllocatedResourceAuxClass
      cim22DeviceServiceImplementationAuxClass

   the structure rule for cimAssociationInstance: <sr35>, <sr37>,
   <sr47>, <sr50>

2.3 cimCapabilitiesInstance

   Multiple classes define two linked indexed arrays:  Capabilities and
   CapabilityDescriptions.  In the LDAP mapping, these are replaced with
   separate instances of cimCapabilitiesInstance, DIT contained by the
   defining class.

3. Class Definitions

   For efficiency in the LDAP representation, associations are specified
   as a combination of auxiliary classes and DIT structure rules.
   Attribute definitions for each class are presented with the object
   class.  Other definitions are also provided when necessary.

   While this approach was chosen to minimize the number of DN pointers
   stored in the schema, some pointer dereferencing is necessary.  While

   not explicitly stated, all DN pointers are assumed to support the
   extended matching rule defined in [4].  Attribute names for DN
   pointers follow the convention that a single pointer to "foo" is
   named "fooRef" while an array of pointers would be named "fooRefs."

   Note: all attribute, object class, and name form OIDs are place
   holders, and syntax OIDs in definitions have been replaced by names
   for clarity.

3.1 cim22DeviceConnectionAuxClass

   The class shows that two or more devices are connected together.

      ( <oid-at289> NAME 'cimNegotiatedSpeed'
        DESC 'When several bus and/or connection speeds are possible, the
              NegotiatedSpeed property defines the one in use between the
              Devices. Speed is specified in bits per second. If
              connection or bus speeds are not negotiated, or if this
              information is not available/important to Device
              management, the property should be set to 0.'
        SYNTAX integer SINGLE-VALUE
      )

      ( <oid-at290> NAME 'cimNegotiatedDataWidth'
        DESC 'When several bus and/or connection data widths are
              possible, the NegotiatedDataWidth property defines the one
              in use between the Devices. Data width is specified in
              bits. If data width is not negotiated, or if this
              information is not available/important to Device

3.2 cim22DeviceIdentityAuxClass

   This association shows that two logical devices represent different
   aspects of the same underlying entity.  This association refines the
   logical identity superclass by restricting it to the device level and
   defining its use in well understood scenarios. One of these scenarios

   is to represent that a device is both a 'bus' entity and a
   'functional' entity. For example, a device could be both a PCI device
   (or an USB device), as well as a keyboard. The other scenario is a
   device having multiple functional roles that can not be distinguished
   by their hardware realization alone. For example, a Fiber Channel
   adapter might have aspects of both a NetworkAdapter and a
   SCSIController.

   This auxiliary class associates a fibre port with a fibre channel
   adapter. Cardinalities are defined to show the intent and usage of
   the model, that an Adapter is synonymous with its Port (connection
   point).

   Where more than one Port may be active at a time, individual Adapters
   with individual operating data and characteristics really exist. If
   there are multiple connection points, but they exist only to provide
   multiple physical form factors (only one connection may be active at
   a time), then one fibre channel adapter and one fibre port (the
   active one) exist. On the hardware side, the realizations of these
   entities in cim22PhysicalElement objects may be as a cim22Card (for
