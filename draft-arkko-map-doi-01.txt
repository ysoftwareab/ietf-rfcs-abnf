   the Network Elements (NEs). The Internet Security Association and
   Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) defines a framework for security
   association management and cryptographic key establishment for the
   Internet. This framework consists of defined exchanges, payloads,
   and processing guidelines that occur within a given Domain of
   Interpretation (DOI). This document defines the MAP Security DOI
   (MAPSEC DOI), which instantiates ISAKMP for use with MAP when MAP
   uses ISAKMP to negotiate security associations.

2. Terms and Definitions

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

3. Introduction

3.1. MAP

   In the Global Mobile System (GSM) and Universal Mobile
   Telecommunication System (UMTS) networks, the MAP protocol
   plays a central role in the signaling communications between
   the Network Elements (NEs). User profiles, authentication, and
   mobility management are performed using MAP. MAP is an SS7 protocol
   and runs over the TCAP, SCCP, and MTP protocol layers, typically
   using dedicated PCM links.

   The mobile networks are moving towards IP-based solutions, and
   completely IP based networks and new protocols such as SIP
   will in few years time replace MAP. However, MAP and SS7
   signaling networks have to be supported during the transition
   time, and beyond, due to the need to retain legacy equipment
   in networks.

3.2. Requirements for a DOI

   Within ISAKMP, a Domain of Interpretation is used to group related
   protocols using ISAKMP to negotiate security associations.  Security
   protocols sharing a DOI choose security protocol and cryptographic
   transforms from a common namespace and share key exchange protocol
   identifiers.  They also share a common interpretation of DOI-specific
   payload data content, including the Security Association and
   Identification payloads.

   Overall, ISAKMP places the following requirements on a DOI
   definition:

     o  define the naming scheme for DOI-specific protocol identifiers



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 3]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               22 February 2001


     o  define the interpretation for the Situation field
     o  define the set of applicable security policies
     o  define the syntax for DOI-specific SA Attributes (Phase II)
     o  define the syntax for DOI-specific payload contents
     o  define additional Key Exchange types, if needed
     o  define additional Notification Message types, if needed

   For instance, the IP Security DOI [IPDOI] describes the use of
   ISAKMP in the context of IP Security AH and ESP and the IP
   Compression protocols. The IP Security DOI also includes the
   details for how phase 1 authentication and protection of ISAKMP
   itself is performed between two IP nodes.

3.3. MAP Security

   Due to the role of MAP in the authentication process
   of GSM phones, operators are concerned about its lack of
   cryptographic security support. For this reason a new protocol
   header has been developed to protect MAP messages, much
   in the same way as IPsec ESP protects IP packets. Also
   similarly, a key management mechanism is needed for MAP.
   The intention of the standardization entities working on
   MAP is to reuse an existing key management mechanism,
   namely ISAKMP, and parts of IKE and the IPsec DOI.
   The reasons for wishing to reuse ISAKMP include the
   following:

        o  Avoiding  the  security  and  complexity  pitfalls   involved
          in new protocol design

        o Benefits of using the same  protocol  that  IP-based
          (especially IPv6) nodes already use for other purposes.

   The use of IKE and IPsec DOI for MAP Security is possible since the
   networks employing MAP Security will always have also
   network-to-network IP connectivity even if MAP and SS7
   are still used for the signaling.

   The remainder of this document details the instantiation of these
   requirements for using the GSM  MAP  protocol  and  its  security  to
   provide authentication, integrity, and/or confidentiality  for  MAP
   messages sent between cooperating Network Elements.

   For a description of the GSM and MAP architecture, see [???] and
   [???].

3.4. Network Architecture

   The MAP Security protocol may provide confidentiality, integrity, and
   replay protection services to the MAP messages it transports.
   The purpose of the MAP Security header in the protocol is to
   provide enough information to determine the MAP SA and Protection
   Modes used in securing the MAP operation that follows the
   header.

   Typically, two NEs belong to two different operator networks.
   The arrangement is shown in Figure 1.

      Figure 2. Use of IKE for two purposes.


   One benefit of using IKE can be seen in Figure 2. As the network
   elements use both MAP and another, IP-based protocol X they
   can use ISAKMP/IKE to negotiate keys for both. In this case,
   IKE phase 1 needs to be run just once.

   In an alternative network arrangement, the Network Elements
   do not have key management support or direct IP connections
   to other networks. In this case a Key Administration Center
   (KAC) handles the negotiations on the behalf of the NEs. This
   is shown in Figure 2.

      Figure 3. Complex network architecture for MAP Security



   In this arrangement, the security of the communications
   between the NEs and the KAC is of great importance. Security
   mechanisms or transport protocols for that purpose are, however,



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 6]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               22 February 2001


   not discussed in this document though as an example, IPsec/IKE,
   IPsec/KINK, MPLS VPNs [MPLS], or ATM Permanent Virtual Connections
   could be used.

   Only one SA (pair) needs to exist between two networks in
   this arrangement, even if there is a large number of NEs
   communicating to the NEs of the other network. (Note
   that MAP Security employs time stamps instead of sequence
   numbers, making the simultaneous use of the same SA in
   multiple NEs possible.)

3.5. Reuse of IPSEC DOI and IKE

   The MAP DOI for ISAKMP is always used in devices that have
   IP connectivity to the peer device. There are no additional
   requirements set forth by the MAP Security or MAP protocols
   regarding the identification and authentication of the communicating
   peers. Therefore, all IPSEC DOI definitions and IKE procedures
   regarding phase 1 of IKE are used unchanged in the MAPSEC DOI.

   Furthermore, the IKE procedures regarding phase 2 are used
   unchanged, with the following exceptions:

        o  Identity types used in phase 2 are different.

        o  SA payloads are different.

        o  There are no MAPSEC-specific phase 2 notifications.

        o  The procedure for creating keys  for  MAP  Security
           is different than that for IPsec.

   Systems implementing the MAP Security DOI MUST support
   this DOI using ISAKMP/IKE. However, MAP Security DOI
   does not require the implementations to support full
   ISAKMP/IKE. Specific MAP Security ISAKMP/IKE profile
   is given below.

   The requirements set forth in the IKE [ISAKMP,
   IKE] and IPsec DOI [IPSDOI] MUST be followed with the
   exception of the following:

     o  Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) SHOULD be
        supported in Phase 2.
     o  In contrast to the requirements set in [IKE],
        Aggressive Mode MUST be implemented and Main
        Mode SHOULD be implemented.
     o  Only one identity type, ID_FQDN, MUST be



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 7]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               22 February 2001


        implemented for phase 1. Other identity types
        specified in [IPSDOI] SHOULD be implemented.
     o  Only the 3DES encryption algorithm SHA1 algorithms
        MUST be implemented as ISAKMP encryption and hash
        operations.
     o  SA lifetime notifications will not be allowed
        [see section 4.5.3].
     o  SA deletetion will not be allowed (this is
        required in order to ensure that pull-based
        schemes can be used between network elements
        and the KAC when the architecture in Figure 3
        is used.)

   Note that IKE [IKE] specifies that all implementations
   MUST support authentication through pre-shared secrets
   and SHOULD support public key based authentication.

3.6. Reuse of KKMP

   The KINK protocol [KINK] uses centralized authenticatin
   from Kerberos to bypass IKE phase 1 and offer a faster
   alternative to IKE phase 2. KINK uses directly ISAKMP
   and IPSEC DOI payload formats, and therefore anything
   negotiable normally

   Systems implementing the MAP Security DOI SHOULD support
   this DOI using KINK.

4. Definition

4.1 Naming Scheme

   Within ISAKMP, all DOI's MUST be registered with the IANA in the
   "Assigned Numbers" RFC [STD-2].  The IANA Assigned Number for the
   MAP Security DOI (MAPSEC DOI) is TBD (N).  Within the MAP Security
   DOI, all well-known identifiers MUST be registered with the IANA
   under the MAPSEC DOI.  Unless otherwise noted, all tables within this
   document refer to IANA Assigned Numbers for the MAPSEC DOI.  See
   Section 6 for further information relating to the IANA registry for
   the MAPSEC DOI.

   All multi-octet binary values are stored in network byte order.

4.2 MAPSEC Situation Definition

   Within ISAKMP, the Situation provides information that can be used by
   the responder to make a policy determination about how to process the
   incoming Security Association request.  For the MAPSEC DOI, the



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 8]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               22 February 2001


   Situation field is a four (4) octet bitmask with the following
   value.

       Situation                   Value
       ---------                   -----
       SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY           0x01

4.2.1 SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY

   The SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY type specifies that the security association
   will be identified by source identity information present in an
   associated Identification Payload.  See Section 4.6.2 for a complete
   description of the various Identification types.  All MAPSEC DOI
   implementations MUST support SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY by including an
   Identification Payload in at least one of the Phase I Oakley
   exchanges ([IKE], Section 5) and MUST abort any association setup
   that does not include an Identification Payload.

4.3 MAPSEC Security Policy Requirements

   The MAPSEC DOI does not impose specific security policy requirements
   on any implementation.  Host system policy issues are outside of the
   scope of this document.

   However, the following sections touch on some of the issues that must
   be considered when designing a MAPSEC DOI host implementation.  This
   section should be considered only informational in nature.

4.3.1 Protection Profiles

   In order to make it possible to establish as small number of
   SAs as possible in large meshed operator network, and to
   limit the protection to the most critical MAP messages, the
   concept of MAP protection profiles has been introduced.
   For instance, one profile could mandates the use of MAP Security
   for all MAP messages, while another could require the use of MAP
   Security only for all messages containing mobile terminal
   authentication vectors, and no security for other messages.

   These actual profiles are numbered and standardized by the 3GPP
   [NDSEC] and are not listed here.

   During the IKE phase 2 negotiations between two nodes or networks,
   they agree on a common protection profile and create a single SA
   (pair) between themselves. The SA is then either used or not used
   for individual MAP messages, based on the standardized rules
   in the particular selected profile.




Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 9]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               22 February 2001


   Note that this is in contrast to the mechanisms used in the IPSEC
   DOI, where several SA (pairs) may be negotiated, one for each
   different class of traffic.

   The protection profile mechanism is also used to provide a way
   for two nodes to agree that they will not use security at all.
   A protection profile that doesn't use MAPSEC for any MAP message
   is defined in [NDSEC].

4.3.2 Key Management Issues

   It is expected that many systems choosing to implement ISAKMP will
   strive to provide a protected domain of execution for a combined IKE
   key management daemon.  On protected-mode multiuser operating
   systems, this key management daemon will likely exist as a separate
   privileged process.

   In such an environment, a formalized API to introduce keying material
   into the TCP/IP kernel may be desirable.  The IP Security
   architecture does not place any requirements for structure or flow
   between a host TCP/IP kernel and its key management provider.

4.3.3 Static Keying Issues

   Static keying is not supported in MAP Security.

4.3.4 Host Policy Issues

   It is not realistic to assume that the  transition  to  MAP  Security
   will occur overnight.  Host systems must be prepared to implement
   flexible policy lists that describe which systems they desire to
   speak securely with and which systems they require  to  speak
   securely  to them. Some notion of proxy firewall addresses may also
   be required.

   A minimal approach is probably a static list of Public Land Mobile
   Network  Identities  (PLMN  IDs).  A  PLMN  ID  is   constructed  by
   concatenating  the  Mobile Country Code (MCC) and  by  the  Mobile
   Network Code (MNC).

4.3.5 Certificate Management

   Host systems implementing a certificate-based authentication scheme
   will need a mechanism for obtaining and managing a database of
   certificates.

   Secure DNS is to be one certificate distribution mechanism, however
   the pervasive availability of secure DNS zones, in the short term, is

   doubtful for many reasons.  What's far more likely is that hosts will
   need an ability to import certificates that they acquire through
   secure, out-of-band mechanisms, as well as an ability to export their
   own certificates for use by other systems.

   However, manual certificate management should not be done so as to
   preclude the ability to introduce dynamic certificate discovery
   mechanisms and/or protocols as they become available.

4.4 MAPSEC Assigned Numbers

   The following sections list the Assigned Numbers for the MAPSEC DOI:
   Protocol  Identifiers,   MAPSEC   Transform   Identifiers,   Security
   Association  Attribute Type Values, ID Payload Type  Values,  and
   Notify  Message Type  Values.

4.4.1 MAPSEC DOI Number

   This number is TBD.

4.4.1 MAPSEC Security Protocol Identifier

   The ISAKMP proposal syntax was specifically designed to allow for the
   simultaneous negotiation of multiple Phase II security protocol
   suites within a single negotiation.  As a result, the protocol suites
   listed below form the set of protocols that can be negotiated at the
   same time.  It is a host policy decision as to what protocol suites
   might be negotiated together.

   The following table lists the values for the Security Protocol
   Identifiers referenced in an ISAKMP Proposal Payload for the MAPSEC
   DOI.

       Protocol ID                         Value
       -----------                         -----
       RESERVED                            0
       PROTO_ISAKMP                        1
       PROTO_MAPSEC_MAPSEC                 TBD

4.4.1.1 PROTO_ISAKMP

   The PROTO_ISAKMP type specifies message protection required during
   Phase I of the ISAKMP protocol.  The specific protection mechanism
   used for the MAPSEC DOI is described in [IKE].  All implementations
   within the MAPSEC DOI MUST support PROTO_ISAKMP.

   NB: ISAKMP reserves the value one (1) across all DOI definitions.

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               22 February 2001


   This is exactly as it is in the IPSEC DOI.

4.4.1.2 PROTO_MAPSEC_MAPSEC

   The PROTO_MAPSEC_MAPSEC type specifies the use of the MAP
   Security to protect MAP messages.


4.4.2 MAPSEC ISAKMP Transform Identifiers

   As part of an ISAKMP Phase I negotiation, the initiator's choice of
   Key Exchange offerings is made using some host system policy
   description.  The actual selection of Key Exchange mechanism is made
   using the standard ISAKMP Proposal Payload.  The following table
   lists the defined ISAKMP Phase I Transform Identifiers for the
   Proposal Payload for the MAPSEC DOI.

       Transform                           Value
       ---------                           -----
       RESERVED                            0
       KEY_IKE                             1

   Implementor's note: This is exactly as it is in the IPSEC DOI.

4.4.2.1 KEY_IKE

   The KEY_IKE type specifies the hybrid ISAKMP/Oakley Diffie-Hellman
   key exchange (IKE) as defined in the [IKE] document.  All
   implementations within the MAPSEC DOI MUST support KEY_IKE.

4.4.3 MAPSEC Transform Identifiers

   The following table lists the defined MAPSEC AES Transform
   Identifiers.

       Transform ID                        Value
       ------------                        -----
       RESERVED                            0-1
       MAPSEC_AES                          TBD

4.4.3.1 MAPSEC_AES

   The MAPSEC_AES type specifies a generic MAP Security transform  using
   AES. The  actual  protection  suite  is  determined  in  concert with
   an associated SA attribute list.

   All  implementations  within  the  MAPSEC  DOI  MUST   support   this
   transform. The MAPSEC_AES transform is defined in [NDSEC].

4.5 MAPSEC Security Association Attributes

   The following SA attribute definitions are used in Phase II of an IKE
   negotiation.  Attribute types can be either Basic (B) or Variable-
   Length (V).  Encoding of these attributes is defined in the base
   ISAKMP specification.

   Attributes described as basic MUST NOT be encoded as variable.
   Variable length attributes MAY be encoded as basic attributes if
   their value can fit into two octets.  See [IKE] for further
   information  on  attribute  encoding  in   the   MAPSEC   DOI. All
   restrictions listed in [IKE] also apply to the MAPSEC DOI.

   Implementor's note: In general, the attributes describe here
   behave exactly as the corresponding ones in the IPSEC DOI.
   The attributes Encapsulation Mode, Compression Dictionary Size,
   and Compression Private Algorithm are not supported by MAPSEC DOI.

       Class Values

         SA Life Type
         SA Duration

           Specifies the time-to-live for the overall security
           association.  When the SA expires, all keys negotiated under
           the association (AH or ESP) must be renegotiated.  The life
           type values are:

           RESERVED                0
           seconds                 1

           Values 3-61439 are reserved to IANA.  Values 61440-65535 are
           for private use.  For a given Life Type, the value of the

           Life Duration attribute defines the actual length of the
           component lifetime -- in number of seconds.

           If unspecified, the default value shall be assumed to be
           28800 seconds (8 hours).

           An SA Life Duration attribute MUST always follow an SA Life
           Type which describes the units of duration.

           See Section 4.5.3 for additional information relating to
           lifetime notification.

           Implementor's note: The semantics and values for these
           attributes are exactly as they are in the IPSEC DOI, except
           that kilobyte lifetimes are not supported.

         Group Description

           Specifies the Oakley Group to be used in a PFS QM
           negotiation.  For a list of supported values, see Appendix A
           of [IKE].

           Implementor's note: The semantics and values for these
           attributes are exactly as they are in the IPSEC DOI.

         Authentication Algorithm

           RESERVED                0
           HMAC-MD5                1
           HMAC-SHA                2
           DES-MAC                 3

           AES-MAC                 5

           Values 5-61439 are reserved to IANA.  Values 61440-65535 are
           for private use.

           There is no default value for Auth Algorithm, as it must be
           specified to correctly identify the applicable transform.

           Implementor's  note:   The   semantics   of  the  first  five
values           for  this attribute is exactly as they are in the IPSEC
DOI.
           This specification requires additionally that only AES-MAC
           and the omission of the algorithm are mandatory for  all MAP
           Security implementations. The semantics of the AES-MAC are
           defined in [NDSEC].

         Key Length

           RESERVED                0

           There is no default value for Key Length, as it must be
           specified for transforms using ciphers with variable key
           lengths.  For fixed length ciphers, the Key Length attribute
           MUST NOT be sent.

           Implementor's  note:  The  semantics  and  values  for   this
           attributes is exactly as it is in the IPSEC DOI.

         Key Rounds

           RESERVED                0

           There is no default value for Key Rounds, as it must be
           specified for transforms using ciphers with varying numbers
           of rounds.

           Implementor's  note:  The  semantics  and  values  for   this
           attributes is exactly as it is in the IPSEC DOI.

         MAP Protection Profile

           The value of this attribute is as defined in [NDSEC].

4.5.1 Required Attribute Support

   To ensure basic interoperability, all implementations MUST be
   prepared to negotiate all of the following attributes.

           SA Life Type
           SA Duration
           Auth Algorithm
           MAP Protection Profile

4.5.2 Attribute Negotiation

   If an implementation receives a defined MAPSEC DOI attribute (or
   attribute value)  which  it  does  not  support,  an  ATTRIBUTES-NOT-
   SUPPORTED SHOULD be sent and the security association setup MUST be
   aborted, unless the attribute value is in the reserved range.

   If an implementation receives an attribute value in the reserved
   range, an implementation MAY chose to continue based on local policy.

   Implementor's note: This is exactly as it is in the IPSEC DOI.



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 15]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               22 February 2001


   However, there are no special lifetime attribute parsing
   requirements as only time-based lifetimes are supported.

4.5.3 Lifetime Matching

   Offered and locally acceptable SA lifetimes must match
   exactly under MAPSEC in order for the responder to select
   an SA.

   Implementor's note: This is simplified from the IPSEC DOI
   which required notifications.

4.6 MAP Security Payload Content

   The following sections describe those ISAKMP payloads whose data
   representations are dependent on the applicable DOI.

4.6.1 Identification Payload Content

   The Identification Payload is used to identify the initiator of the
   Security Association.  The identity of the initiator SHOULD be used
   by the responder to determine the correct host system security policy
   requirement for the association.

   During Phase I negotiations, the ID port and protocol fields MUST be
   set to zero or to UDP port 500.  If an implementation receives any
   other values, this MUST be treated as an error and the security
   association setup MUST be aborted.  This event SHOULD be auditable.

   The following diagram illustrates the content of the Identification
   Payload.

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   !  Next Payload !   RESERVED    !        Payload Length         !
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   !   ID Type     !  Protocol ID  !             Port              !
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                  Figure 2: Identification Payload Format

   The Identification Payload fields are defined as follows:

     o  Next Payload (1 octet) - Identifier for the payload type of
        the next payload in the message.  If the current payload is the
        last in the message, this field will be zero (0).



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 16]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               22 February 2001


     o  RESERVED (1 octet) - Unused, must be zero (0).

     o  Payload Length (2 octets) - Length, in octets, of the
        identification data, including the generic header.

     o  Identification Type (1 octet) - Value describing the identity
        information found in the Identification Data field.

     o  Protocol ID (1 octet) - Value specifying an associated IP
        protocol ID (e.g. UDP/TCP).  A value of zero means that the
        Protocol ID field should be ignored.

     o  Port (2 octets) - Value specifying an associated port.  A value
        of zero means that the Port field should be ignored.

     o  Identification Data (variable length) - Value, as indicated by
        the Identification Type.

   The legal Identification Type field values in phase 1 are as
   defined in the IPSEC DOI. However, phase 2 identities should MUST
   conform to the following. The table lists the assigned values
   for  the  Identification  Type  field  found  in  the  Identification
   Payload.

       ID Type                   Value
       -------                   -----
       RESERVED                            0
       ID_KEY_ID                           11

   For types where the ID entity is variable length, the size of the ID
   entity is computed from size in the ID payload header.

   The ID_KEY_ID type specifies an opaque byte stream. In MAPSEC DOI,
   the contents of the data MUST be the the PLMN ID of the initiating
   or responding party.

4.6.2 IPSEC Notify Message Types

   The IPSEC DOI Notify Message types are used in phase 1. In phase
   2, no new notify messages are specified beyond those provided
   by ISAKMP. Implementor's note: MAPSEC does not allow turning
   replay protection on or off which make the use of REPLAY-STATUS
   unnecessary. Responder lifetimes are required to be exactly the
   same as the initiator lifetimes, which makes the use of RESPONDER-
   LIFETIME unnecessary.


4.7 MAPSEC Key Exchange Requirements



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 17]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               22 February 2001


   The MAPSEC DOI introduces no additional Key Exchange types.

5. Security Considerations

   This entire memo pertains to the Internet Key Exchange protocol
   ([IKE]), which combines ISAKMP ([ISAKMP]) and Oakley ([OAKLEY]) to
   provide for the derivation of cryptographic keying material in a
   secure and authenticated manner.  Specific discussion of the various
   security protocols and transforms identified in this document can be
   found in the associated base documents and in the cipher  references.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document contains many "magic" numbers to be maintained by the
   the standardization bodies. In the case of the MAPSEC DOI, the
   3GPP handles the assignment of numbers instead of IANA. This
   section explains the criteria to be used by the 3GPP to
   assign additional numbers in each of these lists.  All values not
   explicitly defined in previous sections are reserved to 3GPP.
   (IANA will still define the DOI numbers, including the DOI
   number for this DOI.)

6.1 MAPSEC Situation Definition

   The Situation Definition is a 32-bit bitmask which represents the
   environment under which the IPSEC SA proposal and negotiation is
   carried out.  Requests for assignments of new situations must be
   accompanied by a 3GPP contribution which describes the interpretation
   for the associated bit.

   The upper two bits are reserved for private use amongst cooperating
   systems.

6.2 MAPSEC Security Protocol Identifiers

   The Security Protocol Identifier is an 8-bit value which identifies a
   security protocol suite being negotiated.  Requests for assignments
   of new security protocol identifiers must be accompanied by a 3GPP
   contribution which describes the requested security protocol.

   The values 249-255 are reserved for private use amongst cooperating
   systems.

6.3 MAPSEC ISAKMP Transform Identifiers

   The ISAKMP Transform Identifier is an 8-bit value which
   identifies a key exchange protocol to be used for the negotiation.
   Requests for assignments of new ISAKMP transform identifiers must be



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 18]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               22 February 2001


   accompanied by a 3GPP contribution which describes the requested key
   exchange protocol.

   The values 249-255 are reserved for private use amongst cooperating
   systems.

6.4 MAPSEC MAP Security Transform Identifiers

   The MAP  Security  Transform  Identifier  is  an  8-bit  value  which
   identifies a particular algorithm to be used to provide security
   protection  for  MAP  messages.   Requests  for  assignments  of  new
transform
   identifiers   must  be  accompanied  by  a  3GPP  contribution  which
describes
   how to use the algorithm within the framework.

   The values 249-255 are reserved for private use amongst cooperating
   systems.

6.5 MAPSEC Security Association Attributes

   The MAPSEC Security Association Attribute consists of a 16-bit type
   and its associated value.  MAPSEC SA attributes are used to pass
   miscellaneous values between ISAKMP peers.  Requests for assignments
   of new MAPSEC SA attributes must be accompanied by an Internet Draft
   which describes the attribute encoding (Basic/Variable-Length) and
   its legal values.  Section 4.5 of this document provides an example
   of such a description.

   The values 32001-32767 are reserved for private use amongst
   cooperating systems.

6.6 MAPSEC Identification Type

   The MAPSEC Identification Type is an 8-bit value which is used as a
   discriminant for interpretation of the variable-length Identification
   Payload.  Requests for assignments of new Identification Types
   must be accompanied by a 3GPP contribution which describes how to use
   the identification type.

   The values 249-255 are reserved for private use amongst cooperating
   systems.

6.7 MAPSEC Notify Message Types

   The MAPSEC Notify Message Type is a 16-bit value taken from the range
   of values reserved by ISAKMP for each DOI.  There is one range for
   error messages (8192-16383) and a different range for status messages



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 19]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               22 February 2001


   (24576-32767).  Requests for assignments of new Notify Message Types
   must be accompanied by a 3GPP contribution which describes how to use
   the identification type.

   The values 16001-16383 and the values 32001-32767 are reserved for
   private use amongst cooperating systems.

6.8 MAPSEC Protection Profiles

   The MAPSEC Protection Profile values are 8-bit values used
   in decisions regarding actual protection of individual MAP
   messages. The values are defined [NDSEC] and new values must
   be accompanied by a 3GPP contribution which describes the
   semantics of the profile.

   The values 64-255 are reserved for private use amongst cooperating
   systems.

7. Key Derivation for MAP Security

7.1 IKE

   MAP Security requires two sets of keys, one for each direction,
   just as in the case of IPSEC SAs. Both need authentication and
   encryption keys. For one direction of an SA, these two keys are
   taken from the key material as follows (see also Figure 4.)

        o  The authentication key is taken first and then
           the encryption key.




               +---------------+---------------+
               |Message auth   |Message encr   |
               +---------------+---------------+



        Figure 4. Use of derived key material for MAPSEC



   Furthermore, it is possible that the Key Administration
   Centers (KACs) are used. Then just one key is negotiated on behalf
   of the whole set of NEs. Note that MAP Security uses timestamps
   instead of sequence numbers in order to prevent replay attacks,
   so the same SAs can be used by multiple senders.



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 20]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               22 February 2001


   If PFS is not needed, and KE payloads are not exchanged, the new
   keying material is defined as

       KEYMAT = prf(SKEYID_d, protocol | SPI | Ni_b | Nr_b).

   If PFS is desired and KE payloads were exchanged, the new keying
   material is defined as

       KEYMAT = prf(SKEYID_d, g(qm)^xy | protocol | SPI | Ni_b | Nr_b)

   The referenced symbols are defined as follows:

        o  prf is the negotiated, keyed pseudo-random function-- often a
           keyed hash function-- used to generate a deterministic output
           that appears pseudo-random.

        o  SKEYID_d is defined by IKE [IKE].

        o  g(qm)^xy is the shared  secret  from  the  ephemeral  Diffie-
           Hellman exchange of this Quick Mode.

        o  "protocol" and "SPI" are from the  ISAKMP  Proposal
           Payload that contained the negotiated Transform.

        o  Ni_b indicates the body  of  the  initiator's  Nonce  payload
           from IKE [IKE].

        o  Nr_b indicates the body  of  the  responder's  Nonce  payload
           from IKE [IKE].

   A single SA negotiation results in two security assocations-- one
   inbound and one outbound. Different SPIs for each SA (one chosen by
   the initiator, the other by the responder) guarantee a different key
   for each direction.  The SPI chosen by the destination of the SA is
   used to derive KEYMAT for that SA.

   For situations where the amount of keying material desired is greater
   than that supplied by the prf, KEYMAT is expanded by feeding the
   results of the prf back into itself and concatenating results until
   the required keying material has been reached. In other words,

      KEYMAT = K1 | K2 | K3 | ...
      where
        K1 = prf(SKEYID_d, [ g(qm)^xy | ] protocol | SPI | Ni_b | Nr_b)
        K2 = prf(SKEYID_d, K1 | [ g(qm)^xy | ] protocol | SPI | Ni_b |
        Nr_b)
        K3 = prf(SKEYID_d, K2 | [ g(qm)^xy | ] protocol | SPI | Ni_b |
        Nr_b)

        etc.

   This keying material (whether with PFS or without, and whether
   derived directly or through concatenation) MUST be used with the
   negotiated SA.

7.2 KINK

   In KINK, during the establishment of SAs the initiator and  responder
   each provide random nonces that add entropy to the  KDC  supplied
   session key in order to derive the SA keying material (KEYMAT).

     KEYMAT = prf(Secret, Ni [ | Nr ])

   where

        o  prf is as presented in section 7.1.

        o  Secret is the  secret  derived  from  the  Kerberos
           ticket. It is as defined in KINK [KINK].

        o  Ni and and Nr are the nonces of the initiator and
           responder, respectively.

   The function is initially called with the session key found in the
   service ticket used for Secret and is called recursively with the
   resulting KEYMAT until it has generated a proper number of bits.
   Rules regarding the optionality of the Nr are as defined in KINK
   [KINK].

8. Modification History

   The following modifications have been made to the -01 version of
   this draft:

   o  Sections 3.5-3.6 now specify a profile for the use of
      IKE and KINK.
   o  All MAPSEC-specific phase 2 notifications have been removed
      for simplicity.
   o  AES-MAC has been specified instead of HMAC_SHA1. Note that
      Phase 1 has been specified to use 3DES and SHA1 since
      no RFC exists yet to define the use of AES and especially
      AES-MAC for IKE Phase 1.
   o  Some formatting modifications have been made.
   o  Attribute parsing requirements were simplified since
      only a single kind of lifetimes are supported.
   o  MAP_BLOWFISH has been removed since 3GPP hasn't defined it.
   o  MAP_NULL has been removed and protection profiles are

      expected to be used instead to signify that no security
      is needed.
   o  Rules for assigning new numbers within this DOI have
      been clarified.
