Internet-Draft             Service URN Policy                 March 2009


1.  Introduction

   Nowadays location-based services are widespread.  Devices can detect
   a user location and retrieve all available services in the
   sourroundings of that location.  A particular service can be
   described by one or multiple terms such as "restaurant", "parking"
   and "ATM machine".  All such terms, however, need to be formally
   defined so that a registry can be built and used to assure
   consistency and compatibility between devices and between service
   providers.  Since descriptive terms for services are almost
   unbounded, such registry would contain the most common terms.  In
   this document we update the policy for defining new terms, that is
   new service-identifying labels.


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  New Service-Identifying Labels

   This document updates Section 4.1 of [RFC5031] in that the policy for
   adding top-level service labels is "Expert Review".  The expert is
   designated by the RAI Area Director.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise security issues.
