Abstract

   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
   the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) for naming persistent
   resources defined within DVB standards. Example resources include
   technical documents and specifications, eXtensible Markup Language
   (XML) Schemas, classification schemes, XML Document Type Definitions
   (DTDs), namespaces, style sheets, media assets, and other types of
   resources produced or managed by DVB.

1.  Introduction

   The Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) is an industry-led
   consortium of over 270 broadcasters, manufacturers, network
   operators, software developers, regulatory bodies and others in over
   35 countries committed to designing global standards for the global
   delivery of digital television and data services. Services using DVB
   standards are available on every continent with a total of more than
   100 million DVB receivers already deployed.

   DVB would like to assign unique, permanent, location-independent
   names based on URNs for some resources it produces or manages. These
   URns will be constructed according to the URN sytax defined in
   [RFC2141].

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace to be
   registered according to the procedures set forth in [RFC3406].


2.  Specification Template

   This section provides the information required to register a formal
   namespace according to the registration procedure defined in
   [RFC3406]. The URns conform to the syntax defined in [RFC2141].

   Namespace ID:

      "dvb"

   Registration Information:

      Version: 1
      Date: 2007-02-28

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Title:          Executive Director, DVB Project Office
      Affiliation:    DVB Digital Video Broadcasting
      Address:        Ancienne Route 17a

      Email:          macavock@dvb.org

   Declaration of structure:

      URNs assigned by DVB will have the following hierarchical
      structure based on the organizational structure of the DVB
      standards:

         urn:dvb:{NSS}

      where the syntax of "{NSS}" is specified in Section 2.2 of the URN
      Syntax requirements ([RFC2141]).

      The individual URNs will be assigned by DVB through the process of
      development of DVB standards.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      None

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      DVB will establish unique identifiers as appropriate.

      Uniqueness is guaranteed as long as the assigned string is never
      reassigned.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      DVB is committed to maintaining the accessibility and persistence
      of all resources that are officially assigned URNs by the
      organization.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      Assignment is limited to the owner and those authorities that are
      specifically designated by the owner. DVB may designate portions
      of its namespace for assignment by other parties.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      The owner will develop and maintain "URN catalogues" that map all

Internet Draft     DVB URN            July 12, 2007


      assigned URNs to Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) specifically to
      enable Web-based resolution of named resources.  In the future an
      interactive online resolution system may be developed to automate
      this process. The latest information about DVB defined metadata
      can always be found at the owner's website at
      http://www.dvb.org/metadata

      The owner will authorize additional resolution services as
      appropriate.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The "assigned US-ASCII string" is case-insensitive.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified. The owner will develop and maintain URN
      catalogues.  The presence of a URN in a catalogue indicates that
      it is valid.

   Scope:

      Global

3.  Examples

   The following examples are not guaranteed to be real. They are
   presented for pedagogical reasons only.

      urn:dvb:ipdc:esg:2005
      urn:dvb:cs:ZappingTypeCS:2001

4.  Namespace Considerations

   The urn:dvb namespace is used to identify metadata defined by DVB and
   describing DVB multimedia and interactive services. Registration of
   urn:dvb as a formal namespace enables use and referencing of DVB XML
   fragments in other standards worldwide and enables those standards to
   leverage and build upon publicly available DVB metadata schmas and
   fragments.

   URN assignment procedures:

      The individual URNs shall be assigned through the process of

Internet Draft     DVB URN            July 12, 2007


      development of DVB standards by the Digital Video Broadcasting
      Project (DVB). The latest information about DVB defined metadata
      can always be found at the owner's website at
      http://www.dvb.org/metadata

   URN resolution/delegation:

      The resolution and delegation shall be determined through the
      process of development of DVB standards by the Digital Video
      Broadcasting Project (DVB).

      Currently 3 ways of conveying resolution information are defined
      by DVB:

       o  Repeated, cyclic transmission of Resolution Authority Records
          (RAR) and Resolution Records (RR) as auxiliary data in digital
          TV broadcast streams over satellite, cable or terrestrial
          transmissions according to [EN300468], [EN301192] and
          [TS102323].

       o  Repeated, cyclic multicast transmission of Resolution Records
          (RR) via the DVBSTP protocol according to [TS102034].

       o  Unicast delivery of Resolution Records (RR) in response to
          HTTP "GET /dvb/sdns" requests according to [TS102034].

   Type of resources to be identified:

      Types of resources to be identified include XML schema definition
      files, classification schemes and identification systems defined
      and openly published by DVB. These resources being identified
      constitue a metadata system to describe digital multimedia
      broadcast services or content conveyed as part of such services.
      The latest DVB defined metadata can always be found at
      http://www.dvb.org/metadata

   Type of services to be supported:

      Types of services supported include controlled term lookup in
      classification schemes, resolution of ids in identification
      systems.

      Concrete examples of these services include digital television
      services, (near) video on demand services and digital radio sound
      services. Another example are interactive multimedia applications
      which are tied to audiovisual content. This might e.g. be a quiz
      show where viewers can compete against the contestants on the show
      by picking multiple-choce answers with their remote control. These

Internet Draft     DVB URN            July 12, 2007


      end-user services are enabled by the metadata defined under the
      urn:dvb namespace.

5.  Community Considerations

   With the digitisation of the audiovisual broadcasting technologies,
   television receiver platforms become quite similar to personal
   computer equipment in terms of performance, resources and interfaces.
   Hence cross-use of content from the respective other platform (i.e.
   TV and PC) becomes interesting to consumres and service providers
   alike. Web pages can for instance today be viewed on a general
   purpose computer, a set-top box and a mobile phone just the same.
   Audio/video broadcasting services are arriving on mobile phones today
   ("mobile TV"), and efforts are clearly visible to bring such services
   to personal computer platforms as well ("IPTV").

   Hence cross-linking between these two domains, the Internet/personal
   computer doamin and the TV/broadcast domain is called for. Linking
   from broadcast domain metadata to Internet-based services is already
   enabled through the various established URN and URI schemes
   established in the relevant DVB standards ([EN300468], [TS102323] and
   [TS102034]). Linking from Internet/web resources to DVB multimedia
   services is not yet possible in a well-defined way. Thus a URN scheme
   is proposed for DVB defined metadata describing DVB services. As DVB
   issues its publications as international standards and has a well-
   defined a compliance regime, this request is for a formal namespace.

   Open assignment and use of identifiers within the namespace:

      With on-going development of DVB standards, DVB will establish
      requirements for assignment and use of identifiers within the DVB
      namespace. Current identifier assignments can be inferred from the
      relevant DVB standards and from http://www.dvb.org/metadata

   Open operation of resolution servers for the namespace (server):

      With on-going development of DVB standards, DVB will establish
      requirements and seek candidates for operating resolution servers
      as appropriate.

      As set forth in [TS102034], a list of Service Discovery and
      Selection (SD&S) entry points addresses can be provided via DNS
      based on the service location [RFC2782]. The service name is
      "_dvbservdsc", the protocol may be tcp or udp, while the rest of
      the name is the domain name maintained by DVB for service
      discovery. This domain name is set to "services.dvb.org". The DVB
      organization will maintain the services.dvb.org domain name for
      service discovery and new service providers should register with

      DVB to add them to the DNS SRV list.

      By default, the actual service discovery information is provided
      on the IANA registered well-kown dvbservdscport (port number 3937)
      via tcp and udp (see http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-
      numbers). For multicast delivery of service discovery information,
      the IANA registered well-known multicast addresses 224.0.23.14
      (DvbServDisc on IPv4) and FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:12D (DvbServDisc on
      IPv6) are used.

   Creation of software that can meaningfully resolve and access
   services for the namespace (client):

      With on-going development of DVB standards, DVB members will
      develop software implementations of its standards for various
      platforms. Today, these platforms typically include Open Source
      based platforms such as Linux.

      As set forth in [TS102034], a list of Service Discovery and
      Selection (SD&S) entry points addresses may be acquired via DNS
      according to the service location [RFC2782]. The service name is
      "_dvbservdsc", the protocol may be tcp or udp, while the rest of
      the name is the domain name maintained by DVB for service
      discovery. This domain name is set to "services.dvb.org". So the
      lookup shall be either "_dvbservdsc._tcp.services.dvb.org" or
      "_dvbservdsc._udp.services.dvb.org". This requires that the
      terminal support an SRV cognizant DNS client and according to the
      specification in [RFC2782]. The DVB organization will maintain the
      services.dvb.org domain name for service discovery. HTTP servers
      will be found via the tcp protocol method whilst the multicast
      addresses will be found via the udp protocol method.

      By default, the actual service discovery information can be
      obtained from the IANA registered well-kown dvbservdscport (port
      number 3937) via tcp and udp (see
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers). For multicast
      delivery of service discovery information, the IANA registered
      well-known multicast addresses 224.0.23.14 (DvbServDisc on IPv4)
      and FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:12D (DvbServDisc on IPv6) can be joined.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a URN NID registration of "dvb". IANA is
