<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Presence federation refers to the exchange of presence
            information between systems. One of the primary
            challenges in presence federation is scale. With a large
            number of watchers in one domain obtaining presence for
            many presentities in another, the amount of notification
            traffic is large. This document describes an extension to
            the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event framework,
            called view sharing. View sharing can substantially
            reduce the amount of traffic, but requires a certain
            level of trust between domains. View sharing allows the
            amount of presence traffic between domains to achieve the
            theoretical lower bound on information exchange in any
            presence system.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
Presence refers to the ability, willingness and desire to communicate
across differing devices, mediums and services
<a class='info' href='#RFC2778'>[RFC2778]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Day, M., Rosenberg, J., and H. Sugano, &ldquo;A Model for Presence and Instant Messaging,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>. Presence is described using presence
documents <a class='info' href='#RFC3863'>[RFC3863]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sugano, H., Fujimoto, S., Klyne, G., Bateman, A., Carr, W., and J. Peterson, &ldquo;Presence Information Data Format (PIDF),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#RFC4479'>[RFC4479]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;A Data Model for Presence,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, exchanged
using a SIP-based event package <a class='info' href='#RFC3856'>[RFC3856]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;A Presence Event Package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>
Presence federation refers to the interconnection of disparate systems
for the purposes of sharing presence information. This interconnection
involves passing of subscriptions from one system to another, and then
the passing of notifications in the opposite direction.

</p>
<p>
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-simple-interdomain-scaling-analysis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;simple&#8209;interdomain&#8209;scaling&#8209;analysis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Houri, A., Aoki, E., Parameswar, S., Rang, T., Singh, V., and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Presence Interdomain Scaling Analysis for SIP/SIMPLE,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> has
analyzed the amount of traffic, in terms of messages and in terms of
bytes, which flow between systems in various federated use
cases. These numbers demonstrate that presence traffic can be a
substantial source of overhead. The root cause of this scale challenge
is the so-called multiplicative effect of presence data. If there are
N users, each of which have B buddies on their buddy list, and each
buddy changes state L times per hour, the amount of notification
traffic is proportional to N*B*L. For example, in the case of two
extremely large public IM providers that federate with each other
(each with 20 million users),
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-simple-interdomain-scaling-analysis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;simple&#8209;interdomain&#8209;scaling&#8209;analysis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Houri, A., Aoki, E., Parameswar, S., Rang, T., Singh, V., and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Presence Interdomain Scaling Analysis for SIP/SIMPLE,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> shows
that the amount of traffic due to these steady state notifications is
18.4 billion messages per day, an astoundingly large number. Overhead
for subscription maintenance and refreshes brings the total to 25.6
billion per day.

</p>
<p>
The overhead for SIP-based presence can be reduced using SIP
optimizations. In particular,
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sip-subnot-etags'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sip&#8209;subnot&#8209;etags]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Niemi, A., &ldquo;An Extension to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Events for Conditional  Event Notification,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> can reduce the amount of
traffic due to refreshes and polls. However, this optimization targets
the overhead, and doesn't address the core scaling problem - the
multiplicative effect of presence data.

</p>
<p>
For this reason, there is a clear need to improve the scale of SIMPLE
in federated
envrionments. <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sipping-presence-scaling-requirements'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sipping&#8209;presence&#8209;scaling&#8209;requirements]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Houri, A., Parameswar, S., Aoki, E., Singh, V., and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Scaling Requirements for Presence in SIP/SIMPLE,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>
has laid out a set of requirements for optimizations. The essence of
these requirements are that the extension should improve performance,
while being backwards compatible and supporting the privacy and policy
requirements of users.

</p>
<p>
This document defines a mechanism called view sharing in support of
those requirements. The key idea with view sharing is that when there
are many watchers in a domain to a single presentity in another
domain, each of which is actually going to get the exact same presence
document, the domain of the watchers extends a single subscription to
the domain of the presentity, and the domain of the presentity sends a
single copy of the presence document back to the domain of the
watcher. 

</p>
<p>
In the case of a pair of large providers that are peering with each
other, this mechanism can result in a significant savings. 
Assuming a symmetrical system whereby the average buddies per 
watcher is B and the average number of watchers for a user is also B,
if most buddies are in one domain or the other, this optimization can
reduce the overall subscription overhead and notification traffic by a
factor of B/2. In cases where there are a large number of small
domains, this mechanism is less useful. Of course, in such cases, the
amount of traffic between any pair of domains is small anyway.

Overview of Operation</h3>

<p>
The extensions works in the environment shown in
<a class='info' href='#fig-pres-model'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deployment Model</span><span>)</span></a>. The environment assumes two
domains. There are some number of watchers (W1 - W3) in the domain on
the left, which we call the watching domain. All of those watchers are
interested
in the presence of a single presentity P1 in the domain on the right,
which we call the serving domain. The watchers
all make use of a resource list server (RLS) <a class='info' href='#RFC4662'>[RFC4662]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roach, A., Campbell, B., and J. Rosenberg, &ldquo;A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>
which stores their buddy lists and performs the buddy list
expansion. Consequently, when each watcher subscribes to their buddy
list on the RLS, in absence of any optimizations, the RLS will
generate three separate subscriptions to P1, each of which reaches the
presence server in the serving domain.

<p>
Of course, in practice each domain will act as both a watching domain
and a serving domain, thus implementing both sides of the
system.

</p>
<p>
The initial SUBSCRIBE generated by the RLS includes a SIP option tag
"view-share" in the Supported header field, indicating that the RLS
supports the view sharing extension. If the presence server also
supports the extension, it makes use of it and includes an indication
of this fact in the Require header field in the SUBSCRIBE response and
in NOTIFY requests it generates.

</p>
<p>
View sharing requires a level of trust between the two
domains. Consequently, the connection between them utilizes TLS with
mutual authentication. The presence server verifies that the
certificate presented in the mutual authentication matches the domain
of the watcher. 

</p>
<p>
If this is the first subscription from domain 1 for that particular
presentity, the presence server accepts the subscription (assuming the
watcher is authorized of course). The notifications sent to the RLS
include two separate pieces of state. One is the actual presence state
for the presentity. The other is an Access Control List (ACL)
document. This document describes the set of other watchers from the
originating domain, if any, who are authorized to see exactly the same
presence document - in other words, the set of users that share the
same view. Should one of those watchers seek the presence of
that presentity, the RLS from the originating domain does not need to
generate a back-end subscription; rather, it just uses the presence
document it is receiving from the original subscription, and passes it
to both watchers. The ACL can also list users in the originating
domain that are authorized to subscribe to that presentity, but
who will end up receiving a different view. Should one of
those watchers subscribe, the RLS knows that it must perform a
back-end subscription to obtain that view. The ACL can also list
watchers in the originating domain that are not authorized at all, in
which case the RLS could immediately reject their
subscriptions. Finally, if the ACL says nothing about a particular
watcher, it means that the presence server has elected to say nothing
about what view this watcher will receive. Consequently, the RLS must
perform a back-end subscription should that watcher subscribe to the
presentity. 

</p>
<p>
Other subsequent subscriptions to the same presentity from the same
originating domain are processed in a similar way. However, the
presence server in the serving domain will keep track of the set of
subscriptions to the same presentity from the same RLS which are to
receive the same view. When a presence notification is to be sent,
instead of sending it on all subscriptions, the notification is sent
on just a single subscription.

</p>
<p>
Should the authorization policies in the serving domain change, an
updated ACL is sent, informing the watching domain of the new
policies. This may require the watching domain to extend a back-end
subscription to obtain a view, or may change the view an existing
watcher is receiving, and so on.

</p>
<p>
The ACL allows the serving domain a great deal of flexibility in the
level of trust it imparts to the watching domain. The following are
all possible approaches that the serving domain can utilize:

</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>No Trust:</dt>
<dd> When a presence server receives the
  subscription, it elects not to use this mechanism at all using the
  negotiation techniques defined here.
  
</dd>
<dt>Minimal Trust:</dt>
<dd> When a watcher subscribes to a
  presentity, the ACL generated for that subscription includes only
  that watcher, along with an identifier for their view. Consequently,
  for each watcher in domain 1 there will be a backend subscription to
  domain 2. However, should multiple watchers share the same view, the
  presence server in domain 2 sends a single presence document on one
  of the subscriptions, and the RLS uses this for all of the other
  watchers with the same view. With this approach, domain 2 never
  discloses the list of authorized watchers ahead of time, and it has
  full knowledge of each watcher that is subscribed. However, it gets
  the performance benefits of reducing the amount of notification
  traffic. 

</dd>
<dt>Partial Trust:</dt>
<dd> When a watcher subscribes to a
  presentity, the ACL generated for that subscription includes that
  watcher and all other watchers authorized for that same
  view. Consequently, there will only be one backend subscription from
  the RLS to the presence server for each view. However, the full set
  of authorized watchers is not disclosed ahead of time, only those
  that will get the same view. With partial trust, the presence server
  will not know the full set of watchers currently subscribed.

</dd>
<dt>Full Trust:</dt>
<dd> When a watcher subscribes to a presentity,
  the ACL generated for that subscription includes that watcher and
  all other watchers that are authorized for that view, and all other
  views, along with a rule that says that all other watchers get
  rejected. In this case, as with partial trust, there is only one
  backend subscription from the RLS to the presence server for each
  view. The full set of watchers is disclosed ahead of time as
  well. The presence server will not know the full set of watchers
  currently subscribed.

</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<p>
Depending on the level of trust, the mechanism trades off inter-domain
messaging traffic for increased processing load in the RLS to handle
the ACL documents.

RLS Behavior</h3>

<p>
This section defines the procedures that are to be followed by the
RLS. It is important to note that, even though this specification
defines an extension to the SIP events framework, that extension is
only useful for the back-end subscriptions generated by an RLS. The
extension defined here is not applicable or useful for individual
users generating subscriptions. Indeed, if it were utilized by
individual users, it has the potential for violations of user
privacy. See <a class='info' href='#sec-security'>Section&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class='info'>Security Considerations</span><span>)</span></a> for a discussion.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
On Receipt of a Resource List Subscription Request</h3>

<p>
When the RLS receives a subscription to a resource list which includes
some presentity P in another domain, it follows the rules defined
here. 

</p>
<a name="anchor5"></a><br /><hr />
<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Authentication and Authorization</h3>

<p>
First, the RLS MUST check a configured list of peer domains for which
this extension is to be applied. Because of the potential privacy
disclosures involved in unauthorized use of this facility, it can only
be used between pairs of domains which have a pre-arranged agreement
to utilize it. If the domain of the presentity P matches one of the
configured list of peer domains, the RLS is permitted to utilize this
extension. If not, the extension MUST NOT be used.

</p>
<p>
Next, the RLS MUST send the SUBSCRIBE request over a
mutually authenticated TLS connection. The RLS MUST check that
the subjectAltName in the certificate of its peer contains a domain
name that is a match for the domain of the URI of the presentity. If they
are not a match, view sharing cannot be utilized for this
subscription. 

</p>
<p>
The procedures followed by the RLS after this point depend on whether
the RLS already has a backend subscription to the presentity that is
in the active state, and for which an ACL has been received. 

</p>
<a name="anchor6"></a><br /><hr />
<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1.2"></a><h3>3.1.2.&nbsp;
No Active Back-End Subscription</h3>

<p>
The RLS MUST generate a back-end subscription to obtain the state
of the presentity. The RLS MUST include a
Supported header field in the request with the option tag
"view-share". The Accept header field MUST be present in the request
and MUST include the "application/aclinfo+xml" MIME type amongst the
list of supported types. The RLS MUST include an +sip.instance Contact
header field parameter <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sip-outbound'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sip&#8209;outbound]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jennings, C., &ldquo;Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> to
uniquely identify the RLS instance. 

</p>
<p>
Note that it is possible that two watchers, in a short period of time,
both subscribe to their resource lists, both of which include
presentity P. This will cause the RLS to generate two back-end
subscriptions at around the same time. The RLS is forced to generate
the second back-end subscription because it doesn't have an active
back-end subscription that has yet generated an ACL. Once both
subscriptions become active and generate ACLs, if the watchers are
receiving the same view and both ACLs contain both watchers, the RLS
SHOULD terminate one of the back-end subscriptions.

</p>
<a name="sec-sub"></a><br /><hr />
<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1.3"></a><h3>3.1.3.&nbsp;
Active Back-End Subscription</h3>

<p>
In this case, the RLS already has at least one back-end subscription
to the target presentity P, and it has received at least one ACL for
that presentity. It has received a resource list subscription from
watcher W which includes presentity P. Based on the procedures of
<a class='info' href='#sec-aclinfo'>Section&nbsp;3.2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Processing ACL-Infos</span><span>)</span></a>, the RLS will keep, for each presentity,
the list of the most recent ACLs received on each back-end
subscription currently in place. This is called the current ACL list. 

</p>
<p>
For each ACL Ai in the current ACL list, the RLS performs the rule
determination algorithm of <a class='info' href='#sec-rule-determine'>Section&nbsp;5.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rule Determination Algorithm</span><span>)</span></a> to
compute the rule ID R for the watcher W. This represents the view that
the watcher is supposed to receive.

</p>
<p>
Next, the RLS goes through all subscriptions it currently has
for presentity P. For each one, it takes the identity of the
watcher for that actual subscription. The identity for the watcher for
that actual subscription is equal to the asserted identity included in
the back-end subscription. For example, if SIP Identity
<a class='info' href='#RFC4474'>[RFC4474]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Peterson, J. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> is utilized, this would be the URI present in
the From header field of the back-end SUBSCRIBE. Call the watcher
identity for each subscription Wj. 

</p>
<p>
Next, the RLS computes the rule determination algorithm of
<a class='info' href='#sec-rule-determine'>Section&nbsp;5.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rule Determination Algorithm</span><span>)</span></a> to compute the rule ID Rj for the
watcher Wj on each subscription j. This represents the rule ID for the
view being delivered on that subscription.

</p>
<p>
Then, processing depends on the values of R and Rj:

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
  If R is null, it means that the ACL doesn't specify the view for
  this watcher. The RLS MUST
  generate a back-end subscription to presentity P, and MUST use
  watcher W as the identity in the back-end subscription.

</li>
<li>
  If R is not null, but the associated rule is blocked, it means that
  the watcher will be rejected. The RLS SHOULD NOT perform another
  back-end subscription, and must act as if it had created a back-end
  subscription which was rejected.

</li>
<li>If R is not null, and there is at least one subscription j for
  which Rj = R, it means 
  that subscription j is already generating notifications for the view
  that watcher W is supposed to receive. In that case, the RLS SHOULD
  NOT generate a back-end subscription for P on behalf of W. Rather,
  it should treat the existing back end subscription j as if it were
  the back-end subscription for W, and follow the guidelines of RFC
  4662 <a class='info' href='#RFC4662'>[RFC4662]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roach, A., Campbell, B., and J. Rosenberg, &ldquo;A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> based on that. Subscription j is
  called the generating subscription for watcher W, and the actual
  watcher associated with subscription j, Wj, is called the generating
  watcher Wgen for watcher W. 

</li>
<li>If R is not null, but there is no subscription j for which Rj=R,
  it means that the RLS 
  is not yet receiving the view that watcher W requires. The RLS MUST
  generate a back-end subscription to presentity P, and MUST use
  watcher W as the identity in the back-end subscription.

</li>

Processing NOTIFY Requests</h3>

<p>
If a NOTIFY request arrives with a Require header field that includes
the "view-share" option tag, it MUST be processed according to the
rules of this specification.

</p>
<a name="sec-aclinfo"></a><br /><hr />

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.1"></a><h3>3.2.1.&nbsp;
Processing ACL-Infos</h3>

<p>
If the contents of the NOTIFY are of type "application/aclinfo+xml",
the subscriber processes the body as described here.

</p>
<p>
For each presentity that the RLS has at least one back-end subscription
for, the RLS MUST remember the most recent aclinfo received on
each back-end subscription. This is called the current ACL list for
the presentity. This set of aclinfo is used in
the processing of subscription requests, as described in
<a class='info' href='#sec-sub'>Section&nbsp;3.1.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Active Back-End Subscription</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>
The serving domain can change policies at any time. When it does, it
sends an updated ACL on one or more subscriptions. The RLS MUST store
this ACL. Furthermore, the ACL might impact the views being received
by watchers, and may impact the state of the back-end subscriptions. 

</p>
<p>
The RLS computes the set of watchers Wi which have a resource list
subscription that includes the presentity P for whom an updated ACL
has just been received. For each Wi, it performs the view
determination algorithm (see <a class='info' href='#sec-rule-determine'>Section&nbsp;5.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rule Determination Algorithm</span><span>)</span></a> on
the current ACL set. Let Ri be the view associated with watcher Wi. If
Ri has not changed from prior to the receipt of the new ACL, no action
is taken. However, if it has changed, the RLS takes the set of current
back-end subscriptions, and for each subscription j, computes the view
determination algorithm for its associated watcher Wj, to produce
Rj. The action to take depends on what has changed:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
  If Ri is now null, it means that the
  serving domain has changed the views associated with watcher Wi, and
  this new view is not known to the RLS. The
  RLS MUST generate a new back-end subscription on behalf of watcher
  Wi for presentity P to obtain this view. 

</li>
<li>
  If Ri is now a blocked rule, it means that the serving domain has
  now blocked Wi from obtaining the presence of the presentity. The
  RLS must act as if it had a back-end subscription on behalf of
  watcher Wi which was terminated.

</li>
<li>If Ri is not null and not blocked, and if there is an Rj which
  matches the new Ri, it means that the 
  serving domain has changed the views associated with watcher Wi, and
  changed them to another view already being received by the RLS. The
  RLS MUST treat this back-end subscription j as if it were the
  back-end subscription to presentity P for watcher Wi. If the most
  recent presence document received on this back-end subscription is
  not a semantic match for the presence document most recently
  delivered to Wi for presentity P, the RLS MUST send this most recent
  presence document to watcher Wi.

</li>
<li>
  If Ri is not null and not blocked, but there is no Rj which matches
  the new Ri, it means that the 
  serving domain has changed the views associated with watcher Wi, and
  this new view is not one currently being delivered to the RLS. The
  RLS MUST generate a new back-end subscription on behalf of watcher
  Wi for presentity P to obtain this view. 

</li>
</ul><p>

</p>
<p>
Furthermore, if there are now two back-end subscriptions j1 and j2 for
which Aj1 = Aj2, the RLS SHOULD terminate one of those two
subscriptions. Two ACL documents are considered equal if they
enumerate the same set of rules with the same members for each rule.

Processing Presence Documents</h3>

<p>
If the contents of the NOTIFY is a presence document, the RLS follows
the procedures defined here.

</p>
<p>
Let Wj be the watcher on the subscription j on which the presence
document was just received. Let Rj be the results of running the rule
determination algorithm on Wj using the current ACL set. Next, the RLS
takes the set of watchers Wi which have presentity P on their buddy
lists. The RLS then runs the rule determination algorithm on each Wi
using the current ACL set, producting Ri for each watcher Wi. For each
Ri that is equal to Rj, the RLS MUST utilize the presence document
just received as if the back-end subscription j was in fact for
watcher Wi. This will typically cause that presence document to be
sent in a NOTIFY request to each such watcher, though each watcher may
have some kind of filtering policy which causes the RLS to modify the
document prior to delivery.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h3>4.2.&nbsp;
Processing Initial SUBSCRIBE Requests</h3>

<p>
First, the subscription is processed as it normally would be,
including authorization and policy around the presence document to be
delivered to the watcher. Furthermore, if the presence agent wishes to
utilize view sharing for this subscription, it MUST include a Require
header field in the first NOTIFY request (and indeed any subsequent
ones) it sends confirming this
subscription, and that NOTIFY MUST contain the "view-share" option
tag. 

</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the initial state sent by the presence agent MUST include an
ACL document. It is formatted according to the rules and
considerations in <a class='info' href='#sec-aclformat'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>ACL Format</span><span>)</span></a>. 

</p>
<p>
The initial state sent by the presence agent might include an actual
presence document. In particular, a presence document MUST be sent if
one of the following is true:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>There is only one subscription from the watching domain to this
  presentity that has the view associated with the watcher.

</li>
<li>
  There is more than one subscription from the watching domain to this
  presentity with the same view, but the +sip.instance parameter for the
  remote target (as conveyed in the Contact header field of the

  same domain, but from different RLS in the watching domain. Each RLS
  in the watching domain needs to get their own copy of the view for a
  particular presentity.

</li>
</ul><p>
If one of these conditions is not true, the presence agent SHOULD NOT
send an initial presence document on this subscription.

</p>
<p>If an ACL and a presence document are to be delivered, they MUST be
delivered in a separate NOTIFY request (unless the 
subscriber indicated support for multipart, in which case the content
MAY be included in a single NOTIFY with mulitpart content).

<a name="rfc.section.4.4"></a><h3>4.4.&nbsp;
Policy Changes</h3>

<p>
There are several different types of policy changes that can occur:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the definitions for a particular rule change, the presence agent
  MUST assign a new rule ID for that rule. For each subscription to a
  presentity which contained that rule, the presence agent MUST send
  an updated ACL which includes a rule with this new rule ID.

</li>
<li>If some watcher W was previously associated with rule X and is now
  associated with rule Y, the presence agent checks if it has any
  subscriptions from watcher W. If it does, it MUST send an updated
  ACL on that subscription. Based on the rules in
  <a class='info' href='#sec-aclformat'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>ACL Format</span><span>)</span></a>, this ACL will contain rule Y and
  will at least include W amongst the list of members. Furthermore, if
  there were subscriptions from other watchers, but the presence agent
  had previously sent an ACL on the subscription which was a match for
  W, it MUST send an updated ACL on that subscription. This updated
  ACL MAY omit a statement about rule Y or MAY include it. However,
  the updated ACL MUST NOT claim that watcher W will receive rule X.

</li>
<li>
  If some watcher W was previously associated with rule X and is now
  blocked, the presence agent checks if it has any subscriptions from
  watcher W. If it does, it MUST terminate the back-end
  subscription. If it doesn't, but it has a subscription from some
  other watcher which had included a rule that was a match for W, the
  presence agent  MUST send an updated ACL on that subscription. This updated
  ACL MAY omit any statement about watcher W, or MAY include them as
  part of a blocked rule in that ACL.

</li>
<li>
  If some watcher W was previously blocked and is now permitted and
  associated with some rule X, the presence agent checks if it had any
  subscriptions from some other watcher which included a blocked rule
  that matched watcher W. If it had, it MUST send an updated ACL on
  that subscription. That updated ACL MAY omit any statement about
  watcher W, or MAY indicate that watcher W is now associated with
  rule X.

</li>
</ul><p>

</p>
<p>
Of course, a policy change will also potentially alter the presence
documents that are associated with a view. If so, the presence agent
MUST send an updated document on a subscription if one of the
following is true:

</li>
</ul><p>

<p>
If neither is true, the presence agent MUST select one subscription
amongst the several which share the same presentity, view, and
User-Agent header field, and sent an updated notification on that
subscription. The choice of subscriptions is arbitrary and MAY change
for each notification.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1"></a><h3>5.1.&nbsp;
Document Structure and Semantics</h3>

<p>
An ACL document informs a watching domain of the set of views that can
be received by that domain, and associates specific watchers with
specific views. It is very important to understand that the ACL
document does not convey the actual processing that will be applied by
the serving domain. It does not indicate, for example, whether
geolocation is present in a presence document, or which rich presence
<a class='info' href='#RFC4480'>[RFC4480]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Gurbani, V., Kyzivat, P., and J. Rosenberg, &ldquo;RPID: Rich Presence Extensions to the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> data elements will be conveyed. It merely
provides grouping - indicating which watchers from the watching domain
will receive the same view.

</p>
<p>
Each ACL document starts with the enclosing root element
&lt;acl-list&gt;. This contains the list of rules defined by the
ACL. Each rule is represented by the &lt;rule&gt; element. Each rule
represents a specific view, which is generated by the presence server
based on its authorization, composition and filtering policies. Each
rule is associated with a rule ID, which is a mandatory attribute of
the &lt;rule&gt; element. This ID is scoped within a single
presentity. That is, the IDs for two rules for different presentities
are unrelated.

</p>
<p>
The &lt;rule&gt; element also contains an optional "blocked"
boolean attribute. If "true", it means that the rule specifies that
the associated set of watchers will be rejected, should they
subscribe. This can be used by the watching domain to avoid performing
back-end subscriptions to users which will only be blocked anyway.

</p>
<p>
Each &lt;rule&gt; contains the set of users that will receive the
corresponding view. This can be described by an enumerated set or by a
default. If it is an enumerated set, the &lt;rule&gt; is followed by a
sequence of &lt;member&gt; elements, each of which contains a SIP URI
for the watcher that will receive that view. 

</p>
<p>
The default view is specified by including a single child element for
&lt;rule&gt; - &lt;other&gt;. The default view applies to all watchers
except those enumerated by other rules. For this reason, an ACL
document which contains a default view MUST include the rule IDs and
associated members for all other views that are delivered to
watchers. For example, consider a presentity that has three
views. View 1 is delivered to watchers A and B. View 2 is delivered to
watcher C. View 3 is delivered to everyone else. An ACL document that
includes the default view must also include views 1 and 2 with
watchers A, B, and C. 

</p>
<p>In contrast, an ACL document that does not
include a default does not need to include all views, and it does not
  need to include all members for a particular view. Using the example
  above, it is valid to include an ACL document which includes only
  view 1 with watcher 1.

</p>
<p>
If two URI are present within &lt;member&gt; elements within the same
&lt;rule&gt;, it represents a contract by the presence server that
both users MUST get the same view. Formally, if the presence server
were to receive a subscription from each watcher, both subscriptions
would be accepted or both would be rejected, and if accepted, each
subscription would receive semantically identical presence documents
at approximately the same time. 

</p>
<p>
Even if two users will receive the same view, a presence server MAY
assign each to a different view ID. There is no requirement that two
unique views actually contain different presence data. The only
requirement is that, if two users are listed within the same rule,
that they do in fact receive the same view. 

</p>
<p>
An ACL document delivered in a subscription from watcher W MUST
include the view associated with watcher W and MUST include watcher W
explicitly in a &lt;member&gt; element or implicitly by presence of an
&lt;other&gt; element.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h3>5.2.&nbsp;
Trust Considerations when Construcing ACLs</h3>

<p>
The semantics above give very little guidance about what a presence
server should include in an ACL. The amount of information to convey
depends on the level of trust between the watching and serving
domains. 

</p>
<p>
Optimal performance is achieved when the ACL document for a presentity
includes all views that the server might ever deliver, and includes
all members for each view, including any defaults and blocked
rules. However, this informs the watching domain of the set of allowed
and blocked watchers, and associated groupings amongst watchers. 

</p>
<p>
Slightly worse performance is achieved when the ACL document for a
presentity sent in a subscription from watcher W includes only a
single view - the one for watcher W - along with the full set of
watchers which will also receive that view, assuming it is not the
default view. If the view is the default view, the document can
include just watcher W. This approach will cause back-end
subscriptions from every watcher that will receive the default, but it
discloses less information to the watching domain. In particular, the
full set and number of views is never known by the watching
domain. The fact that a view is default is never known by the watching
domain. The full set of users that are permitted to view the presence
of the presentity is never disclosed to the watching domain. The
performance of this approach is still reasonably good when the default
rule is blocked. However it is much less effective when the default is
not blocked, and many watchers receive the default. 

</p>
<p>
Another choice for construction of ACL documents is to include, in a
subscription from watcher W, a single rule containing the rule ID for
the view that watcher W will receive, along with a single member -
W. This approach will still result in a back-end subscription from
each watcher. However, a single notification is sent for each view,
rather than one per watcher. The benefit of this construction is that
it provides the watching domain no additional information about the
authorization policies of the presentity than if this extension were
not in use at all.

Rule Determination Algorithm</h3>

<p>
Several steps in the processing of the ACL require that the RLS in the
watching domain execute the rule determination algorithm for watcher W
on an ACL set. This algorithm is a simple algorithm which takes, as
input, a watcher W with a given SIP URI, and a set of ACL documents
Ai, and returns as output, a rule ID R, which is the rule ID for the
view that, according to the set of ACLs, watcher W should receive.

</p>
<p>
The algorithm proceeds as follows. First, each Ai is matched to W. 
ACL Ai is a match
for watcher W if: 
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>ACL Ai contains a &lt;member&gt; tag whose URI is a match, based on URI
equality, for W, or
</li>
<li>none of the &lt;member&gt; tags in Ai contain a URI that is a match,
  based on URI equality, for W, but there is an
  &lt;other&gt; element in Ai 
</li>
</ul><p>

</p>
<p>
If no ACL Ai matched, the algorithm returns a null result.

</p>
<p>
For each ACL Ai that matches based on the rules above, take the id of
the enclosing &lt;rule&gt; element that contained the 
&lt;member&gt; or 
&lt;other&gt; element that caused the match. For ACL Ai, this is rule
Ri. For example, consider the following ACL:

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;acl-list "xmlns=urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:aclinfo"&gt;
    &lt;rule id="1"&gt;
      &lt;member&gt;sip:user1@example.com&lt;/member&gt;
      &lt;member&gt;sip:user2@example.com&lt;/member&gt;
    &lt;/rule&gt;
    &lt;rule id="2"&gt;
       &lt;member&gt;sip:user3@example.com&lt;/member&gt;
    &lt;/rule&gt;
    &lt;rule id="3"&gt;
      &lt;other/&gt;
    &lt;/rule&gt;
 &lt;/acl-list&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
If this document is A1, and the watcher is sip:user3@example.com, the
associated rule R1 is 2. If the watcher is sip:user1@example.com or
sip:user2@example.com, the rule R1 is 1. If the watcher is anyone else
from example.com, such as sip:user4@example.com, the rule R1 is 3.

</p>
<p>
If all Ri are equal, denote R = Ri. Thus, R is the rule ID associated
with this watcher. Normally, all Ri will be equal. However, during
transient periods of changes in authorization state, it is possible
that inconsistent ACL documents exist. In that case, R is assigned the
value Ri from the ACL Ai which is the most recently received amonst
all ACL.

Performance Analysis</h3>

<p>
This section considers the performance improvement of the mechanism
when it is maximally exercised. In that case, the full ACL, including
blocked senders, is returned in the first subscription to a
presentity. This analysis assumes there is a single, monolithic
presence server serving each domain. 

</p>
<p>
The optimizations improve ramp-up, steady state, and termination
message loads. In particular, each of those loads, without the
optimization described here, is proportional to C04, the total number
of federated presentities per watcher. If we assume symmetry, such
that the number of federated presentities per watcher is equal to the
number of watchers per federated presentity, then each of the load
figures is reduced by C04. That is, the system behaves identically to
the case where there is a single watcher per federated presentity, and
assuming symmetric, the same as if there is a single federated
presentity per watcher - e.g., C04 = 1. 

</p>
<p>
Consider then the very large network peering model in
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-simple-interdomain-scaling-analysis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;simple&#8209;interdomain&#8209;scaling&#8209;analysis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Houri, A., Aoki, E., Parameswar, S., Rang, T., Singh, V., and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Presence Interdomain Scaling Analysis for SIP/SIMPLE,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. In this
model, the assumption is two large peering domains with 20 million
users each, with a value of 10 for C04. With this optimization, the
number of steady state notifications due to presence state changes
drops from 18.4 billion per day to 1.84 billion per day. The number of
messages per second overall is reduced from 654,167 per second to
65,417 per second. Still a big number, of course, but it can't
actually get much smaller.

</p>
<p>
Indeed, it can be readily shown that, assuming the federated domains
do not actually share raw presence inputs and the actual policies that
govern operation of their servers, no protocol can do better
(constants, such as mesage size and the need for protocol responses
and acknowledgements aside). Consider a domain with N
presentities. Each presentity changes state P times per hour. Every
time the state changes, the domain applies its authorization and
composition policies. The resulting presence document cannot be known
to the watching domain. Thus, there must be at least one message from
the serving to watching domain, per view, in order to inform it of
that view. This means that the steady state rate of messages can never
be better than N*P, and this is exactly the factor governing the rate
of messages when this optimization is applied.

<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>REQ-001:</dt>
<dd> The solution should not hinder the
    ability of existing SIMPLE clients and/or servers from peering
    with a domain or client implementing the solution.  No changes may
    be required of existing servers to interoperate. This requirement
    is met by usage of the Supported and Require mechanisms and SIP
    which negotiate its usage.

</dd>
<dt>REQ-002:</dt>
<dd> It
    does NOT constrain any existing RFC functional or security
    requirements for presence. The mechanism does not change anything
    that is possible without it. It does, however, introduce new
    privacy considerations, described below in

<dd> Systems that are not using
    the new additions to the protocol should operate at the same level
    as they do today. This requirement is met by usage of the
    Supported and Require mechanisms in SIP.

</dd>
<dt>REQ-004:</dt>
<dd> The solution does not limit the ability for presentities
      to present different views of presence to different
      watchers. This requirement is met by usage of the ACL document,
      which allows the serving domain to associate a watcher with any
      view it likes, and to change it over time.

</dd>
<dt>REQ-005:</dt>
<dd> The solution does not restrict the ability of a
      presentity to obtain its list of watchers. The mechanism does
      allow a presence server to 
      know the list of watchers, at the expense of non-optimal
      performance. In particular, it will receive a subscription from
      each watcher. However, it only generates one notification per
      view on presence changes. The fully optimized solution will
      result in a loss of knowledge of the set of watchers. However,
      it is a policy decision at the presence agent about whether it
      would like to make this tradeoff.

</dd>
<dt>REQ-006:</dt>
<dd> The solution MUST NOT create any new or make worse any
      existing privacy holes. This requirement is met, but only when
      carefully provisioned. See <a class='info' href='#sec-security'>Section&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class='info'>Security Considerations</span><span>)</span></a>.

</dd>
<dt>REQ-007:</dt>
<dd> It is highly desirable for any presence system (intra or
      inter-domain) to scale linearly as number of watchers and
      presentities increase linearly. When the most optimal technique
      is used, there is always one subscription per view per
      presentity, independent of the number of watchers in the remote
      domain or the number of averages buddies per buddy list. Since
      the number of views is not proportional to the number of users,
      the total traffic volume in a domain is linear with its number
      of presentities, and is independent of the number of users in
      the peering domain. 

</dd>
<dt>REQ-008:</dt>
<dd> The solution SHOULD NOT require significantly more state
      in order to implement the solution. The mechanism requires
      storage of the ACL, which has a size exactly equal to the number
      of subscriptions that would be required if the extension were
      not in place. Thus the memory usage is not worsened compared to
      the baseline.

</dd>
<dt>REQ-009:</dt>
<dd> It MUST be able to scale to tens of millions of
      concurrent users in each domain and in each peer domain. The
      analysis in <a class='info' href='#sec-anal'>Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Performance Analysis</span><span>)</span></a> shows that, when fully
      utilized, this mechanism is the best that can possibly be
      achieved in any system that does not actually share policies and
      raw presence data.

</dd>
<dt>REQ-010:</dt>
<dd> It MUST support a very high level of watcher/presentity
      intersections in various intersection models. The mechanism is
      optimized for this case.

</dd>
<dt>REQ-011:</dt>
<dd> Protocol changes MUST NOT prohibit optimizations in
      different deployment models esp. where there is a high level of
      cross subscriptions between the domains. Since standard SIP
      techniques are utilized to negotiate the extension, other
      mechansims can be defined in the future.

</dd>
<dt>REQ-012:</dt>
<dd> New functionalities and extensions to the presence
      protocol SHOULD take into account scalability with respect to the
      number of messages, state size and management and processing
      load. That is exactly what this extension targets.

</dd>
<dt>REQ-013:</dt>
<dd> The solution SHOULD allow for arbitrary federation
      topologies including direct peering and intermediary
      routing. The mechanism is optimized for direct peering. It can
      work in intermediary routing cases as well.

<a name="rfc.section.8"></a><h3>8.&nbsp;
Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
The principal question with the specification is whether it alters the
privacy characteristics of a non-optimized federated system.

</p>
<p>
Consider first the case where the serving domain is using the minimal
trust model. In that case, the ACL provided to the watching
information does not carry any information that the watching domain
doesn't already know. It merely points out when two watchers share the
same view. This is something that the watching domain could have
already ascertained by comparing presence documents delivered to each
watcher. The ACL makes this task easier, but nonetheless the watching
domain could have already ascertained it. Consequently, there is no
change whatsoever in the level of privacy afforded by the optimization
when this mode is used.

</p>
<p>
However, when an ACL is provided that includes other users besides the
actual watcher, this provides additional information to the watching
domain. This is, however, information that the watching domain could
find out anyway. If it generated a subscription from each of its users
to the presentity it would be able to determine who from its domain is
allowed to subscribe and what view they would receive. This would be
an expensive operation to be sure, but it is possible. Consequently,
the optimization doesn't really provide anything new to the
originating domain, even in this case.

</p>
<p>
However, there is an attack possible when the information is divulged
to an end user. Consider a watching domain that doesn't actually
implement this extension at all. A user within the domain uses a
client that generates a subscription to a presentity in a remote
domain. This subscription uses an outbound proxy in the watching
domain. The outbound proxy is just a proxy, and therefore doesn't
remove or modify the Supported header field in the request. The
serving domain accepts the subscription and sends an ACL that contains
the full set of watchers that are permitted in the originating
domain. The original watcher now knows the set of other authorized
buddies within their own domain, and what views they will see. While
this is information that the domain overall would have access to, it
is not information an end user would normally have access
to. Consequently, this is a more serious privacy violation.

</p>
<p>
It is for this reason that this specification requires that both sides
of the federated link be explicitly provisioned to utilize this
optimization. In the attack above, the watching domain would not have
set up a peering relationship with the serving domain. If it had, it
would have an RLS and would not have permitted the user to directly
subscribe in this way. Thus, when the subscription is received by the
serving domain, it will find that it has no agreement with the
originating domain, and would not utilize view sharing. This thwarts
the attack.

</p>
<p>
This remedy is not optimal because it requires on provisioning to
prevent. There does not appear to be any easy cryptographic means to
prevent it, however.

</p>
<p>
In all cases, view sharing requires secure authentication and
encryption between the domains that use it. This is provided by TLS.
