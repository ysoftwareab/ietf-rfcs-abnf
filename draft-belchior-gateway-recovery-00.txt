                  DLT Gateway Crash Recovery Mechanism
                   draft-belchior-gateway-recovery-00

Abstract

   This memo describes crash recovery mechanisms for the Open Digital
   Asset Protocol (ODAP).  The memo presents ODAP-2PC, a protocol
   assures that gateways running ODAP are crash fault-tolerant, meaning
   that the atomicity of asset transfers are assured even if gateways
   crash.  This protocol includes the description of the messaging and
   logging flows necessary for gateways to keep track of current state,
   the crash-recovery protocol, and a rollback mechanism.

1.  Introduction

   Gateway systems that perform virtual asset transfers among DLTs must
   possess a degree of resiliency and fault tolerance in the face of
   possible crashes.  A key component of crash recovery is maintaining
   logs that enable either the same or other backup gateways to resume
   partially completed transfers.  Another key component is an atomic
   commit protocol (ACP) that guarantees that the source and target DLTs
   are modified consistently (atomicity) and permanently (durability),
   e.g., that assets that are taken from the source DLT are persisted
   into the recipient DLT.

   This document proposes: (i) the parameters that a gateway must retain
   in the form of logs concerning message flows within asset transfers;
   (ii) a JSON-based format for logs related to asset transfers.

2.  Terminology

   There following are some terminology used in the current document:

   o  Gateway: The nodes of a DLT system that are functionally capable
      of handling an asset transfer with another DLT.  Gateway nodes
      implement the gateway-to-gateway asset transfer protocol.

   o  Primary Gateway: The node of a DLT system that has been selected
      or elected to act as a gateway in an asset transfer.

   o  Backup Gateway: The node of a DLT system that has been selected or
      elected to act as a backup gateway to a primary gateway.

   o  Message Flow Parameters: The parameters and payload employed in a
      message flow between a sending gateway and receiving gateway.

   o  Source Gateway (or G1): The gateway that initiates the transfer
      protocol.  Acts as a coordinator of the ACP and mediates the
      message flow.

   o  Recipient Gateway (or G2): The gateway that is the target of an
      asset transfer.  It follows instructions from the source gateway.

   o  Source DLT: The DLT of the source gateway.

   o  Target DLT: The DLT of the recipient gateway.

   o  Log data: The log information is retained by a gateway connected
      to an exchanged message within an asset transfer protocol.

   o  Log entry: The log information generated and persisted by a
      gateway regarding one specific message flow step.

   o  Log format: The format of log-data generated by a gateway.

   o  Atomic commit protocol (ACP): A protocol that guarantees that
      assets that are taken from a DLT are persisted into the other DLT.
      Examples are two and three-phase commit protocols (2PC, 3PC,
      respectively) and non-blocking atomic commit protocols.

3.  Gateway Crash Recovery

   The gateway architecture [ODAP] defines two gateway nodes belonging
   to distinct DLT systems as a means to conduct a virtual asset
   transfer in a secure and non-repudiable manner while ensuring the
   asset does not exist simultaneously on both blockchains.

   One of the key deployment requirements of gateways for asset
   transfers is a high degree of gateways availability.  In this
   document, we consider two common strategies to increase availability:
   (1) to support the recovery of the gateways and (2) to employ backup
   gateways with the ability to resume a stalled transfer.

   To this end, gateways must retain relevant log information regarding
   incoming protocol messages (parameters, payloads, etc.) and
   transmitted messages.  In particular, logs are written before
   operations (write-ahead) to provide atomicity and durability to the
   asset exchange protocol.  The log-data is considered as internal

   resources to the DLT system, accessible to the backup gateway and
   possible other gateway nodes.

3.1.  Gateway Transfer Model

   The Open Digital Asset Protocol (ODAP) is a gateway-to-gateway
   protocol used by a sender gateway and a target gateway to perform a
   virtual asset's unidirectional transfer [ODAP].  The protocol is DLT-
   agnostic.  The transfer process is started by a Client (application)
   that interacts with the source gateway or both (source and recipient)
   gateways to provide instructions regarding actions, related resources
   located in the source DLT system, and resources located in the remote
   DLT system.  The protocol has two modes, but here we consider only
   the Relay Mode: Client-initiated Gateway to Gateway asset transfer.
   When we refer to the ODAP protocol in this document, we refer to the
   ODAP protocol in Relay Mode.

   ODAP has to be instanced with an ACP protocol to guarantee that the
   source and target DLTs are modified consistently, a property
   designated Atomicity [BHG87].  ACPs consider two roles: a Coordinator
   that manages the execution of the protocol and Participants that
   manage the resources that must be kept consistent.  The source
   gateway plays the ACP role of Coordinator, and the recipient gateway
   plays the Participant role in relay mode.  The message exchange is
   represented below:

   The simplified message flow format is in the form < ODAP_PHASE, STEP,
   COMMAND, GATEWAY > >, where ODAP_PHASE corresponds to the current
   phase of ODAP, STEP corresponds to a monotonically increasing
   integer, COMMAND to the command type being issued by a set of
   gateways (GATEWAY).  Figure 1 depicts a high-level view of ODAP$'s
   phase 1, through its several steps, involving G1 and G2.  For
   simplicity, we omit the ODAP_PHASE, STEP and GATEWAYS field.  The ACP
   exchanges messages to assure atomicity while recording every
   operation via the log primitive.  However, both two-phase commit and
   three-phase commit can block in case nodes fail.  The protocol being
   blocking means that if the coordinator crashes, then gateways may not
   finish transactions.  When a crash happens, gateways will be waiting
   for a confirmation/abort, and possibly holding the lock regarding a
   specific digital asset.

3.2.  Crash Recovery Model

   We assume gateways fail by crashing, i.e., by becoming silent, not
   arbitrary or Byzantine faults.  We assume authenticated reliable
   channels obtained using TLS/HTTPS [TLS].  To recover from these
   crashes, gateways store in persistent storage data about the step of
   their protocol.  This allows the system to recover by getting from
   the log the first step that may have failed.  We consider two
   recovery models:

   o  Self-healing mode: assumes that after a crash, a gateway
      eventually recovers;

   o  Primary-backup mode: assumes that after a crash, a gateway may
      never recover, but that this failure can be detected by timeout
      [AD76].

   In Self-healing mode, when a gateway restarts after a crash, it reads
   the state from the log and continues executing the protocol from that
   point on.  We assume the gateway does not lose its long-term keys
   (public-private key pair) and can reestablish all TLS connections.

   In Primary-backup mode, we assume that after a period T of the
   primary gateway failure, a backup gateway detects that failure
   unequivocally and takes the role of the primary gateway.  The failure
   is detected using heartbeat messages and a conservative value for T.
   The backup gateway does virtually the same as the gateway in self-
   healing mode: reads the log and continues the process.  The
   difference is that the log must be shared between the primary and the
   backup gateways.  If there is more than one backup, a leader-election
   protocol may be executed to decide which backup will take the primary
   role.

3.3.  Recovery Procedure

   Gateways can crash at several points of the protocol.

   In 2PC and 3PC, recovery requires that the protocol steps are
   recorded in a log immediately before sending a message and
   immediately after receiving a message.  Thus, at every step k of the
   protocol, each gateway writes in the log entry indicating its current
   state.  When a node crashes:

   o  Self-healing mode: the recovered gateway informs the other party
      of its recovery and continues the protocol execution;

   o  Primary-backup mode: if a node is crashed indefinitely, a backup
      is spun off, using the log storage API to retrieve the most recent
      version of the log.

   Upon recovery, the recovered node attempts to retrieve the most
   recent log of operations.  Based on the latest log entry last(log),
   it derives the current state of the asset transfer.  This can be
   confirmed by querying all other nodes involved in such transfer by
   sending a recovery message rm.  After the current state is fetched
   and agreed upon by all parties, the ODAP protocol continues.  There
   are several situations when a crash may occur.  The first one is
   immediately after starting the transfer, as shown below:

   mode, querying the last log entry from the log storage API.  After
   that, it sends a recovery message to G2, advertising that the
   recovery has been completed and asking for an updated version of the
   log, i.e., the current state.  In this case, the latest version of
   the log corresponds to G1?s log.  After synchronization has been
   achieved, the process can continue.

   The second scenario requires further synchronization (Figure 3).
   Some fields have been omitted for simplicity.  At the retrieval of
   the latest log entry, G1 notices its log is outdated.  It updates it
   upon necessary validation and then communicates its recovery to G2.
   The process then continues as defined.

3.4.  Log Storage

   Log primitives are translated into log entries, persisted by the log
   storage API in the format < operation, step, phase, gateways >, where
   the gateway issuing the operation is implicit.  For example, when G1
   initiates the operation log(init, n, k, G2), a log entry specifying
   the command init given to G2, in the nth phase of the phase k is
   translated to a log entry.  After that, the log entry is persisted
   via the log storage API.  Thus, log primitives are also translated
   into log storage API requests.

   We consider the log file to be a stack of log entries.  Each time a
   log entry is added, it goes to the top of the stack (the highest
   index).  Logs can be saved locally (computer?s disk), in an external
   service (e.g., cloud storage service), or in the DLT the gateway is
   operating.  Saving logs locally is faster than saving them on the
   respective ledger but delivers weaker integrity and availability
   guarantees.  Saving log entries on a DLT may slow down the protocol
   because issuing a transaction is several orders of magnitude slower
   than writing on disk or accessing a cloud service.  Self-healing mode
   is compatible with the three types of logs, but Primary-backup mode
   requires storage in an external service or the DLT.

Internet-Draft           Gateway Crash Recovery             January 2021


   If logs are stored in an external service, security is an issue.  We
   assume the storage service used provides the means necessary to
   assure the logs' confidentiality and integrity, stored and in
   transit.  The service must provide an authentication and
   authorization scheme, e.g., based on OAuth and OIDC [OIDC], and use
   secure channels based on TLS/HTTPS [TLS].

   We consider a log storage API that allows developers to abstract from
   the storage details (e.g., relational vs. non-relational, local vs.
   cloud) and handles access control if needed.  This is API-TYPE 1, as
   the gateway uses it to store off-chain resources.

   LOG STORAGE API TABLE

4.  Format of log entries

   The log entries are stored by a gateway in its log.  Entries account
   for the current status of one of the three ODAP flows: Transfer
   Initiation flow, Lock-Evidence flow, and Commitment Establishment
   flow.  The recommended format for log entries is JSON [xxx], with
   protocol-specific mandatory fields, support for a free format field
   for plaintext or encrypted payloads directed at the DLT gateway or an
   underlying DLT.  Although the recommended format is JSON, other
   formats can be used (e.g., XML).

   The mandatory fields of a log entry are:

   o  Session ID: unique identifier (UUIDv2) representing an ODAP
      interaction (corresponding to a particular flow)

   o  Sequence Number: represents the ordering of steps recorded on the
      log for a particular session

   o  ODAP Phase ID: flow to which the logging refers to.  Can be
      Transfer Initiation flow, Lock-Evidence flow, and Commitment
      Establishment flow.

   o  Source Gateway ID: the public key of the gateway initiating a
      transfer

   o  Source DLT ID: the ID of the gateway initiating a transfer

   o  Recipient Gateway ID: the public key of the gateway involved in a
      transfer

   o  Recipient DLT ID: the ID of the gateway involved in a transfer

Internet-Draft           Gateway Crash Recovery             January 2021


   o  Timestamp: timestamp referring to when the log entry was generated
      (UNIX format)

   o  Payload: Message payload.  Contains subfields Votes (optional),
      Msg, Message type.  Votes refers to the votes parties need to
      commit in the 2PC.  Msg is the content of the log entry.  Message
      type refers to the different logging actions (e.g., command,
      backup).

   o  Payload Hash: hash of the current message payload

   Optional log entry fields are:

   o  Logging profile: contains the profile regarding the logging
      procedure.  If not present, a local store for the logs is assumed.

   o  Source Gateway UID: the uid of the gateway initiating a transfer

   o  Recipient Gateway UID: the uid of the gateway involved in a
      transfer

   o  Message Digest: Gateway EDCSA signature over the log entry

   o  Last Log Entry: Hash of previous log entry

   o  Access Control Profile: the profile regarding the confidentiality
      of the log entries being stored

5.  Security Considerations

   We assume a trusted, secure communication channel between gateways
   (i.e., messages cannot be spoofed and/or altered by an adversary)
   using TLS 1.3 or higher.  Clients support ?acceptable? credential
   schemes such as OAuth2.0.

   The present protocol is crash fault-tolerant, meaning that it handles
   gateways that crash for several reasons (e.g., power outage).  The
   present protocol does not support Byzantine faults, where gateways
   can behave arbitrarily (including being malicious).  This implies
   that both gateways are considered trusted.  We assume logs are not
   tampered with or lost.

   Log entries need integrity, availability, and confidentiality
   guarantees, as they are an attractive point of attack [BVC19].  Every
   log entry contains a hash of its payload for guaranteeing integrity.
   If extra guarantees are needed (e.g., non-repudiation), a log entry
   might be signed by its creator.  Availability is guaranteed by the
   usage of the log storage API that connects a gateway to a dependable
   storage (local, external, or DLT-based).  Each underlying storage
   provides different guarantees.  Access control can be enforced via
   the access control profile that each log can have associated with,
   i.e., the profile can be resolved, indicating who can access the log
   entry in which condition.  Access control profiles can be implemented
   with access control lists for simple authorization.  The
   authentication of the entities accessing the logs is done at the Log
   Storage API level (e.g., username+password authentication in local
   storage vs. blockchain-based access control in a DLT).

   For extra guarantees, the nodes running the log storage API (or the
   gateway nodes themselves) can be protected by hardening technologies
   such as Intel SGX [CD16].
