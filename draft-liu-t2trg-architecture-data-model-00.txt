1.  Introduction

   This document provides a guidance desgin for architecture and data
   model for Internet of Things (IoT).  The architecture and data model
   can be applied to various kinds of IoT service interaction scenarios,
   like smart home, and independently of the network's underlying
   infrastructure and protocols.

2.  Guidance Design for IoT Architecture

   Guidance design for IoT architecture is shown in figure 1.

              Figure 1: Guidance Design for IoT Architecture

   Summary of the guidance design for IoT architecture

   o  There is a centralized server that connects with devices, user
      application, and other vendor's platform.

   o  The centralized server provides function of device management on
      terminal device, gateway device and child device, including device
      identification, device registration, device firmware update, etc.

   o  The centralized server provides function of user management,
      including user identification, user profile management,etc.

   o  The centralized server provides function of information sharing
      with other vendor's platform, including vendor identification,
      vendor device interoperability, vendor user interoperability, etc.

Internet-Draft                ITS Scenario                     July 2016


   o  The communication between server and user application, between
      server and other platform, between server and terminal device, and
      between server and gateway device, are based on TCP/IP

   o  Child device could be constrained device that cannot support TCP/
      IP stack.

3.  Guidance design for IoT data model

   This section discusses the data model for IoT based on the
   architecture in Section 2.  The data model can be used in the
   communication between server and user application, between server and
   other platform, between server and terminal device, and between
   server and gateway device.

   The default encoding schema for this data model is JSON or JSON-LD

3.1.  Data model design

   The data model is defined in figure 2.
