Abstract

   The Generalized PWid FEC permits a procedure know as single-sided
   signaling as documented.  In this procedure, one end of the
   pseudowire always initiates the pseudowire setup and the target of
   that label mapping message only signals in response.  For certain
   applications of pseudowires it is advantages to configure the
   pseudowire type (PW type) at the target of the initial label mapping
   message.  This document specifies a means of doing this.

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-pwe3-wildcard-pw-type-00.txt    January 2006


1. Introduction

   The Generalized PWid FEC [CONTROL] permits a procedure know as sin-
   gle-sided signaling as documented in [L2VPNSIG].  In this procedure,
   one end of the pseudowire always initiates the pseudowire setup.  The
   target router of that initial label mapping message only signals in
   response.  For certain applications of pseudowires it is advantages
   to configure the pseudowire type (PW_Type) at the target of the ini-
   tial label mapping message.

   For certain applications where an igress PE is serving as part of a
   gateway function between a layer two network and layer two attachment
   circuits on remote PEs, the initial setup may be caused by signaling
   from the layer 2 network.  However, the layer 2 signaling may not
   contain sufficient information to determine the PW type.  This infor-
   mation, however would be known at the PE supporting the targeted
   attachment circuit.

   By the procedures of [CONTROL] both label mapping messages must carry
   the PW type and the two unidirectional mapping messages must be in
   agreement.  Thus within the current procedures the initiator must
   specify the PW_Type.



1.1. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].


2. Wildcard PW Type

   In order to allow a PE to initiate the signaling exchange for a pseu-
   dowire without knowing the pseudowire type, the following procedure
   is used.

   The initiating PE includes a PW type of 0x7fff [to be assigned by
   IANA].  The semantics are the following:

   1.  To the targeted PE, this value indicates that it is to determine
       the PW type (for both directions) and signal that in a label
       mapping message back to the initiating PE.

   2.  For the procedures of [CONTROL] this PW type is interpreted to
       match any PW type other than itself.  That is the targeted PE may
       respond with any valid PW type other than the Wildcard PW type.

3. Procedures

   A targeted PE which receives a Wildcard PW type follows the normal
   procedures in checking the AGI and TAII values.  If a label mapping
   message has already been issued, it MUST respond to this message with
   a Label_Release message.

   If PE2 cannot map the TAI to one of its Forwarders, then PE2 sends a
   Label Release message to PE1, with a Status Code of "Unas-
   signed/Unrecognized TAI", and the processing of the Label Mapping
   message is complete.  Otherwise, it responds with a Label_Mapping
   message with the configured PW type.

   When the initiating PE receives a Label_Mapping message from the tar-
   geted PE it uses this as the PW type for both directions.  If it is
   unable to support the PW type it MUST send a Label_Release message
   for the label allocated in the Label_Mapping message which initiated
   the exchange.  It also SHOULD respond to the received Label_Mapping
   message with a Label_Release message.  Further actions are beyond the
   scope of this document but could include notifying the associated
   application (if any) or notifying network management.


4. Security Considerations

   This draft does not impact the security aspects of [CONTROL].  The
   message exchanges remain the same.


5. IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following allocation be made from the IETF
   consensus range of the "Pseudowire Type" registry as defined in
   [IANA].
