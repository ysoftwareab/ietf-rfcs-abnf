Abstract

  This memo describes a set of practices intended to enable a root
  server operator to provide access to a single named root server in
  multiple locations. This document presumes a one-to-one mapping
  between named root servers and administrative entities (operators).
  The primary motivation for the development of these practices is to
  increase the distribution of root DNS servers to previously
  under-served areas of the network topology and to reduce the latency
  for DNS query responses in those areas.


1. Architecture

1.1 Server Requirements

  In addition to meeting the host requirements for root servers listed
  in [1], each of the hosts should be configured with two network
  interfaces.  One of the network interfaces should use the shared
  unicast address associated with the root name server.  The other
  interface, referred to as the administrative interface below, should
  use a distinct address specific to that host.  The host should
  respond to DNS queries only on the shared-unicast interface.  The
  host should use the administrative interface and address for all mesh
  coordination.
    
1.2 Zone file delivery

  In order to minimize the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, zone
  files should be delivered to the administrative interface of the
  servers participating in the mesh.  Secure file transfer methods and
  strong authentication should be used for all transfers.  

1.3 Synchronization

  The root name servers traditionally form a loosely synchronized
  system and some delay in propagation of a specific zone file is an
  expected part of the current operational environment.  As noted
  below in section 3.1.2, lack of synchronization among servers using
  the same shared unicast address could create problems for some users
  of this service.  In order to minimize that risk, switch-overs from
  one data set to another data set should be coordinated as much as
  possible.  The use of synchronized clocks on the participating hosts
  and set times for switch-overs provides a basic level of
  coordination.  A more complete coordination process would involve
  receipt of zones at a distribution host, confirmation of the
  integrity of zones received, distribution of the zones to all of the
  servers in the mesh, confirmation of the integrity of the zones at
  each server, coordination of the switchover times for the servers in
  the mesh, and the institution of a failure process to ensure that
  servers that did not receive correct data or could not switchover to
  the new data ceased to respond to incoming queries until the problem
  could be resolved.


1.4 Server Placement

  Though the geographic diversity of server placement helps reduce the
  effects of service disruptions due to local problems, it is
  diversity of placement in the network topology which is the driving
  force behind these distribution practices.  Server placement should
  emphasize that diversity.  Ideally, servers should be placed
  topologically near the points at which the operator exchanges routes
  and traffic with other networks.  
  
1.5 Routing
 
  The organization administering the mesh of servers sharing a unicast
  address must have an autonomous system number and speak BGP to its
  peers.  To those peers, the organization announces a route to the
  network containing the shared-unicast address of the root name
  server.  The organization's border routers must then deliver the
  traffic destined for the root name server to the nearest
  instantiation.  Routing to the administrative interfaces for the
  servers can use the normal routing methods for the administering
  organization.

  One potential problem with using shared unicast addresses is that
  routers forwarding traffic to them may have more than one available
  route, and those routes may, in fact, reach different instances of
  the shared unicast address.  Because UDP is self-contained, UDP
  traffic from a single source reaching different instances presents
  no problem.  TCP traffic, in contrast, may fail or present
  unworkable performance characteristics in a limited set of
  circumstances.  For failures to occur, the router forwarding the traffic
  must both have equal cost routes to the two different instances and
  use a load sharing algorithm which does per-packet rather than
  per-destination load sharing.

  Four things mitigate the severity of this problem.  The first is
  that UDP is a fairly high proportion of the traffic to the root
  servers.  The second is that the aim of this proposal is to
  diversify the topological placement of the roots; for most users,
  this means that any new instances of a root server will be at a
  significantly different cost metric from existing instances.  Some
  set of users may end up in the middle, but that should be relatively
  rare.  The third is that per packet load sharing is only one of the
  possible load sharing mechanisms, and other mechanisms are
  increasing in popularity.  Lastly, in the case where the traffic
  is TCP, per packet load sharing is used, and equal cost routes to
  different instances of a root server are available, any
  implementation which measures the performance of the roots to select
  a preferred server will quickly drop that root server.  Performance
  might subsequently degrade, but the affected users will still have
  access to the DNS through the other twelve root servers.
    
  Appendix A. contains an ASCII diagram of a simple implementation of
  this system.  In it, the odd numbered routers deliver traffic to the
  shared-unicast interface network and filter traffic from the
  administrative network; the even numbered routers deliver traffic to
  the administrative network and filter traffic from the shared-unicast
  network.  These are depicted as separate routers for the ease this
  gives in explanation, but they could easily be separate interfaces
  on the same router.  Similarly, a local NTP source is depicted for
  synchronization, but the level of synchronization needed would not
  require that source to be either local or a stratum one NTP server.
  
      
2. Administration

2.1 Points of Contact

   A single point of contact for reporting problems is crucial to the
   correct administration of this system.  If an external user of the
   system needs to report a problem related to the service, there must
   be no ambiguity about whom to contact.  If internal monitoring does
   not indicate a problem, the contact may, of course, need to work
   with the external user to identify which server generated the
   error.  


3. Security Considerations

   As a core piece of internet infrastructure, the root servers are a
   common target of attack.  The practices outlined here increase the
   risk of certain kinds of attack and reduce the risk of others.
   
3.1 Increased Risks

3.1.1 Increase in physical servers

   The architecture outlined in this document increases the number of
   physical servers acting as roots, which could increase the
   possibility that a server mis-configuration will occur which allows
   for a security breach.  In general, the entity administering a mesh
   should ensure that patches and security mechanisms applied to a
   single member of the mesh are appropriate for and applied to all of
   the members of a mesh.

3.1.2 Data synchronization problems

   The level of systemic synchronization described above should be
   augmented by synchronization of the data present at each of the
   servers.  While the DNS itself is a loosely coupled system,
   debugging problems with data in specific zones would be far more
   difficult if different two servers sharing a single unicast address
   might return different responses to the same query.  For example,
   if the data associated with example.com has changed and the
   administrators of the domain are testing for the changes at the
   root name servers, they should not need to check each instance of a
   named root server.  The use of ntp to provide a synchronized time
   for switch-over eliminates some aspects of this problem, but
   mechanisms to handle failure during the switchover are required.
   In particular, a server which cannot make the switchover must not
   roll-back to a previous version; it must cease to respond to
   queries so that other root servers are queried.

3.1.3 Distribution risks

   If the mechanism used to distribute zone files among the servers is
   not well secured, a man-in-the-middle attack could result in the
   injection of false information.  Digital signatures will alleviate
   this risk, but encrypted transport and tight access lists are a
   necessary adjunct to them.

3.2 Decreased Risks

   The increase in number of physical servers reduces, however, the
   likelihood that a denial-of-service attack will take out a
   significant portion of the DNS infrastructure.  The increase in
   servers also reduces the effect of machine crashes, fiber cuts, and
   localized disasters by reducing the number of users dependent on
   a specific machine.
 
4. IANA Considerations

   Any root server operator choosing to employ the practices described
   in this document should do so in coordination with the Root Server
   System Advisory Committee.  In particular, since zone files will be
   distributed to the administrative interfaces of meshed servers, the
   access control list for distribution of the zone files should
   include the administrative interface of the server or servers,
   rather than their shared unicast addresses.  Since the aim of 
   this set of practices is to increase the availability of root
   servers in under-served areas of the network topology, coordination
   of the deployment of new servers would also be of benefit.
