Abstract

   Practice has shown that there are a number of DNS zones all iterative
   resolvers and recursive nameservers should, unless configured
   otherwise, automatically serve.  RFC 4193 already specifies that this
   should occur for D.F.IP6.ARPA.  This document extends the practice to
   cover the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for RFC 1918 address space and other
   well known zones with similar usage constraints.

Internet-Draft            Locally-served Zones                 June 2006


1.  Introduction

   Practice has shown that there are a number of DNS [RFC 1034] [RFC
   1035] zones all iterative resolvers and recursive nameservers should,
   unless configured otherwise, automatically serve.  These zones
   include, but are not limited to, the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for the
   address space allocated by [RFC 1918] and the IP6.ARPA zones for
   locally assigned local IPv6 addresses, [RFC 4193].

   This recommendation is made because data has shown that significant
   leakage of queries for these name spaces is occurring, despite
   instructions to restrict them, and because sacrificial name servers
   have been deployed to protect the immediate parent name servers for
   these zones from excessive, unintentional, query load [AS112].  There
   is every expectation that the query load will continue to increase
   unless steps are taken as outlined here.

   Additionally, queries from clients behind badly configured firewalls
   that allow outgoing queries but drop responses for these name spaces
   also puts a significant load on the root servers.  They also cause
   operational load for the root server operators as they have to reply
   to queries about why the root servers are "attacking" these clients.
   Changing the default configuration will address all these issues for
   the zones below.

   [RFC 4193] already recommends that queries for D.F.IP6.ARPA be
   handled locally.  This document extends the recommendation to cover
   the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for [RFC 1918] and other well known IN-
   ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA zones for which queries should not appear on
   the Internet.

   It is hoped that by doing this the number of sacrificial servers
   [AS112] will not have to be increased and may in time be reduced.

   It should also help DNS responsiveness for sites which are using [RFC
   1918] addresses but are misconfigured.

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].


2.  Effects on sites using RFC 1918 addresses.

   Sites using [RFC 1918] addresses should already be serving these
   queries internally, without referring them to public name servers on

   the Internet.

   The main impact will be felt on sites that make use of recursion for
   reverse lookups for [RFC 1918] addresses and have populated these
   zones.  Typically, such sites will be fully disconnected from the
   Internet and have their own root servers for their own non-Internet
   DNS tree or make use of local delegation overrides (otherwise known
   as "forwarding") to reach the private servers for these reverse
   zones.  These sites will need to override the default configuration
   proposed in this draft to allow resolution to continue.

   Other sites that use [RFC 1918] addresses and either have local
   copies of the reverse zones or don't have reverse zones configured
   should see no difference other than the name error appearing to come
   from a different source.


3.  Changes Iterative Resolver Behaviour.

   Unless configured otherwise, a iterative resolver will return name
   errors for queries within the lists of zones covered below.  One
   common way to do this is to serve empty (SOA and NS only) zones.

   A server doing this MUST provide a mechanism to disable this
   behaviour, preferably on a zone by zone basis.

   If using empty zones one should not use the same NS and SOA records
   as used on the public Internet servers as that will make it harder to
   detect leakage from the public Internet servers.  This document
   recommends that the NS record default to the name of the zone and the
   SOA MNAME default to the name of the zone.  The SOA RNAME should
   default to ".".  Implementations SHOULD provide a mechanism to set
   these values.  No address records need to be provided for the name
   server.

   @ 10800 IN SOA @ . 1 3600 1200 604800 10800
   @ 10800 IN NS @


4.  Lists Of Zones Covered

   The lists below are expected to seed a IANA registry.

      30.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA
      31.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA
      168.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA

4.2.  RFC 3330 Zones

      0.IN-ADDR.ARPA /* IPv4 "THIS" NETWORK */
      127.IN-ADDR.ARPA /* IPv4 LOOP-BACK NETWORK */
      254.169.IN-ADDR.ARPA /* IPv4 LINK LOCAL */
      2.0.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA /* IPv4 TEST NET */
      255.255.255.255.IN-ADDR.ARPA /* IPv4 BROADCAST */

4.3.  Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses

      0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.IP

      6.ARPA

      9.E.F.IP6.ARPA
      A.E.F.IP6.ARPA
      B.E.F.IP6.ARPA


5.  Zones that are Out-Of-Scope

   IPv6 site-local addresses and IPv6 Globally Assigned Local addresses

   are not covered here.  It is expected that IPv6 site-local addresses
   will be self correcting as IPv6 implementations remove support for
   site-local addresses however, sacrificial servers for C.E.F.IP6.ARPA
   to F.E.F.IP6.ARPA may still need to be deployed in the short term if
   the traffic becomes excessive.

   For IPv6 Globally Assigned Local addresses there has been no decision
   made about whether the registries will provide delegations in this
   space or not.  If they don't then C.F.IP6.ARPA will need to be added
   to the list above.  If they do then registries will need to take
   steps to ensure that name servers are provided for these addresses.

   This document is also ignoring the IP6.INT counterpart for the
   IP6.ARPA addresses above.  IP6.INT is in the process of being wound
   up with clients already not querying for this suffix.

   This document has also deliberately ignored zones immediately under
   the root.  The author believes other methods would be more applicable
   for dealing with the excess / bogus traffic these generate.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document recommends that IANA establish a registry of zones
   which require this default behaviour, the initial contents are above.
   More zones are expected to be added, and possibly deleted from this
   registry over time.  Name server implementors are encouraged to check
   this registry and adjust their implementations to reflect changes
   therein.

   This registry can be amended through IESG reviewed RFC publication.


7.  Security Considerations

   During the initial deployment phase, particularly where [RFC 1918]
   addresses are in use, there may be some clients that unexpectedly
   receive name error rather than a PTR record.  This may cause some
   service disruption until full service resolvers have been re-
   configured.

   When DNSSEC is deployed within the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA
   namespaces, the zones listed above will need to be delegated as
   insecure delegations.  This will allow DNSSEC validation to succeed
   for queries in these spaces despite not being answered from the
   delegated servers.

   It is recommended that sites actively using these namespaces secure

   them using DNSSEC [RFC 4035] by publishing and using DNSSEC trust
   anchors.  This is good just on general principles.  It will also
   protect the clients from accidental leakage of answers from the
   Internet which will be unsigned.
