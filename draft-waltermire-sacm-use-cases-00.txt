  Analysis of Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) Use

                   draft-waltermire-sacm-use-cases-00

Abstract

   This document identifies foundational use cases, derived functional
   capabilities and requirements, architectural components, and the
   supporting standards needed to define an interoperable, automation
   infrastructure required to support timely, accurate and actionable
   situational awareness over an organization's IT systems.  Automation
   tools implementing a continuous monitoring approach will utilize this
   infrastructure together with existing and emerging event, incident
   and network management standards to provide visibility into the state
   of assets, user activities and network behavior.  Stakeholders will
   be able to use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security
   and operational data to understand the organizations security
   posture, quantify business risk, and make informed decisions that
   support organizational objectives while protecting critical
   information.  Organizations will be able to use these tools to
   augment and automate information sharing activities to collaborate
   with partners to identify and mitigate threats.  Other automation
   tools will be able to integrate with these capabilities to enforce
   policies based on human decisions to harden systems, prevent misuse
   and reduce the overall attack surface.

Internet-Draft               SACM Use Cases                    July 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document addresses foundational use cases in security
   automation.  Portions of these use cases may be considered when
   establishing a charter for the Security Automation and Continuous
   Monitoring (SACM) working group within the IETF.  This working group
   will address a portion of the standards needed to define an
   interoperable, automation infrastructure required to support timely,
   accurate and actionable situational awareness over an organization's
   IT systems.  This document enumerates use cases and break down
   related concepts that cross many IT security information domains.

   Sections [...] of this document focus on:

      Defining the key concepts and terminology used within the document
      providing a common frame of reference;

      Identifying foundational use cases that represent classes of
      stakeholders, goals, and usage scenarios;

      A set of derived functional capabilities and associated
      requirements that are needed to support the use cases;

      A break down of architectural components that address one or more
      functional capabilities that can be used in various combinations
      to support the use cases; and

      An inventory of existing, emerging, and needed data exchange
      models and communications protocols that are required to support
      interoperability between architectural components.

   The standards identified in this document provide a foundation for
   creating interoperable automation tools and continuous monitoring
   solutions that provide visibility into the state of assets, user
   activities, and network behavior.  Stakeholders will be able to use
   these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security and
   operational data to understand the organizations security posture,
   quantify business risk, and make informed decisions that support
   organizational objectives while protecting critical information.
   Organizations will be able to use these tools to augment and automate
   information sharing activities to collaborate with partners to
   identify and mitigate threats.  Other automation tools will be able
   to integrate with these capabilities to enforce policies based on
   human decisions to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the
   overall attack surface.

      Information Export (ipfix) working group.  Basically leveraging
      Netflow to detect network behavior.  This information could be
      received from what the MILE WG is doing with incident response.

      other user activities.

   o  Potential sharing of risk and/or threat behavioral information
      with partners as well as reference data and content like USGCB,

Internet-Draft               SACM Use Cases                    July 2012


6.  Data Exchange Models and Communications Protocols

   Document where existing work exists, what is currently defined by
   SDOs, and any gaps that should be addressed.  Point to existing
   event, incident and network management standards when available.
   Describe emerging efforts that may be used for the creation of new
   standards.  For gaps provide insight into what would be a good fit
   for SACM or another IETF working groups.

   This will help us to identify what is needed for SACM to be
   successful.  This section will help determine which of the
   specifications can be normatively referenced and what needs to be
   addressed in the IETF.  This should help us determine any protocol or
   guidance documentation we will need to generate to support the
   described use cases.

   Things to address:

      For IETF related efforts, discuss work in NEA and MILE.  Address
      SNMP, NetConf and other efforts as needed.

      Reference any Security Automation work that is applicable.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.


8.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
