  This document defines a new optional IS-IS TLVs named CAPABILITY, 
  formed of multiple sub-TLVs, which allows a router to announce its 
  capabilities within an IS-IS level or the entire routing domain.

  Introduction 
   
  There are several situations where it is useful for the IS-IS routers 
  to learn the capabilities of the other routers of their IS-IS level, 
  area or routing domain. Some applications are described in [IS-IS-TE-
  CAP] but for the sake of illustration, one can briefly describes 
  three of them related to MPLS Traffic Engineering. 
   
     - Path Computation Element (PCE) discovery: in several situations, 
    the Traffic Engineering Label Switched (TE LSP) path is computed by 
    a Label Switch Router (LSR) it is not the head-end for (e.g an ABR 
    or an ASBR respectively in the context of inter-area and inter-AS 
    MPLS TE ([INTER-AREA-AS]). In such a case, having the ability to 
    discover the capability of an router to act as a PCE is extremely 
    useful in term of ease of operation, capacity to react to PCE 
    failure, load sharing between a set of PCEs, etc 
    - Mesh-group: the setting up of a mesh of TE LSPs requires some 
    significant configuration effort. [IS-IS-TE-CAP] proposes an auto-
    discovery mechanism whereby every LSR of a mesh advertises its 
    mesh-group membership by means of IS-IS extensions. 
    - Point to Multi-point TE LSP (P2MP LSP). A specific sub-TLV ([IS-
    IS-TE]) allows an LSR to advertise its capabilities to be a ôbranch 
    nodeö of a P2MP TE LSP (see [P2MP] and [P2MP-reqs]). 
     
  The capability mentioned above lead to the specification of specific 
  TLVs carried within the CAPABILITY TLV defined in this document. 
   
  Note that the examples above are provided for the sake of 
  illustration. This document proposes a generic capability 
  advertisement mechanism not limited to MPLS Traffic Engineering.

  IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV 
   
 
 
Vasseur et al.         Expires û August 2004              [Page 2] 

                 draft-vasseur-isis-caps-01.txt      February 2004 
 
 
  The IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV is composed of 1 octet for the type, 1 octet 
  specifying the TLV length, 1 octet of bit flags and a variable length 
  value field, starting with 4 octets of Router ID. 
   
  CODE: To be assigned by IANA 
  LENGTH: Variable (1 octet) 
  VALUE: 
    Router ID (4 octets) 
    Flags (1 octet) 
    Set of optional sub-TLVs (0-249 octets) 
   
  Flags 
   
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |S|U|           | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   
  Currently two bit flags are defined. 
   
  S bit: when set, the IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV MUST be flooded across the 
  entire routing domain; hence, according to the element of procedure 
  defined in section 3, the CAPABILITY TLV MUST be leaked between IS-IS 
  levels or multiple areas of the same IS-IS level by L1L2 routers that 
  support the CAPABILITY TLV. 
   
  U bit: the U bit MUST be set each time the CAPABILITY TLV is leaked 
  into another IS-IS level or another area of the same IS-IS level. 
  When set, the U bit MUST not be changed by any other router. 
   
  The CAPABILITY TLV is OPTIONAL. As specified in section 3, more than 
  one CAPABILITY TLVs may be present. 
   
3. 
  Element of procedure 
   
  In case of capabilities with different scopes, a router MUST include 
  two CAPABILITY TLVs, each TLV carrying the set of sub-TLVs with the  
  same flooding scope. For instance, if a router advertises two 
  capabilities C1 and C2 respectively with an area/level scope and 
  routing domain scope, C1 and C2 being specified by their respective 
  sub-TLV(s), the router MUST include two CAPABILITY TLVs: 
   
     - One CAPABILITY TLV with the S flag cleared carrying the sub-
    TLV(s) relative to C1. The CAPABILITY TLV MUST NOT be leaked into 
    other level or areas of the same level. 
   
     - One CAPABILITY TLV with the S flag set carrying the sub-TLV(s) 
    relative to C2. This CAPABILITY TLV MUST be leaked into other IS-IS 
    levels or areas or the same level after having set the U bit. Other 
    sub-TLVs MUST be unchanged during the leaking procedure.

  A router receiving a CAPABILITY TLV with the U flag set MUST NOT leak 
  the CAPABILITY TLV into another ISIS level or areas. This prevents 
  TLV looping. 
 
4. 
  Interoperability with routers not supporting the capability TLV. 
 
  There is no interoperability issue as a router not supporting the 
  CAPABILITY TLV MUST just silently ignore the TLV(s) and continue the 
  LSP processing. If just a subset of the sub-TLVs carried within the 
  CAPABILITY TLV are supported, then the not supported sub-TLV MUST be 
  silently ignored.

  Security considerations 
 
  No new security issues are raised in this document.
