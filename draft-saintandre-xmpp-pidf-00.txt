Internet-Draft               PIDF Over XMPP                February 2004


1. Introduction

   The Presence Information Data Format ([PIDF]) defines a common
   presence data format for presence protocols that conform to the
   Common Profile for Presence ([CPP]), enabling presence information to
   be transferred across CPP-compliant protocol boundaries without
   modification, with attendant benefits for security and performance.
   Because the syntax for PIDF is XML [XML], it should be
   straightforward to send PIDF data over the Extensible Messaging and
   Presence Protocol [XMPP-CORE], since XMPP is simply an XML streaming
   protocol.  This memo defines a mechanism for encapsulating PIDF data
   within an "extended namespace" contained in an XMPP presence stanza.

1.1 Terminology

   This document inherits terminology defined in [PIDF], [XMPP-CORE],
   and [XMPP-IM].

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [TERMS].

1.2 Discussion Venue

   The author welcomes discussion and comments related to the topics
   presented in this document.  The preferred forum is the
   <xmppwg@jabber.org> mailing list, for which archives and subscription
   information are available at <http://www.jabber.org/cgi-bin/mailman/
   listinfo/xmppwg/>.

2. Protocol

   The PIDF format is defined in [PIDF].  Briefly, the XML namespace
   name is 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf', the root element is <presence/
   >, the <presence/> element must possess an 'entity' attribute, and
   the <presence/> element may contain any number of <tuple/> child
   elements specying information about an entity.

   The recommended method for encapsulating PIDF data within an XMPP
   presence stanza is by including the PIDF <presence/> element as a
   child of the XMPP <presence/> stanza.  Although it may appear that
   this is potentially confusing, the inclusion of the
   'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf' namespace ensures that PIDF data is
   kept separate from XMPP presence data (in accordance with
   [XML-NAMES]).  The following is a simple example of encapsulating
   PIDF data within an "extended namespace" in XMPP:

Internet-Draft               PIDF Over XMPP                February 2004


   A basic example of PIDF over XMPP:

   <presence from='romeo@example.net/orchard' xml:lang='en'>
     <show>dnd</show>
     <status>Wooing Juliet</status>
     <presence xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf'
               entity='pres:romeo@example.net'>
       <tuple id='orchard'>
         <status>
           <basic>open</basic>
         </status>
       </tuple>
     </presence>
   </presence>

   Because base PIDF data does not encapsulate any additional
   information over and above XMPP presence stanzas, there is little
   point to including it in native XMPP systems when it is not encrypted
   (obviously, encrypting PIDF data can help to ensure end-to-end
   encryption of presence information, as described in [XMPP-E2E]).  The
   power of PIDF in the context of XMPP derives from extensions thereto,
   such as the rich presence formats described in [RPID] and the
   geographical location formats described in [GEOLOC].  Any such
   extension to PIDF can be included in an XMPP presence stanza, since,
   according to the definition of "extended namespaces" in [XMPP-IM],
   the format of such extended data is defined by the extension rather
   than by the base XMPP specification itself.  Thus the ability to
   include PIDF data and PIDF data extensions in XMPP enables XMPP-aware
   applications to include any PIDF-compatible data that is currently
   defined or that may be defined in the future.  Naturally, there is no
   guarantee that all XMPP entities will be able to understand such PIDF
   data, and entities that do not understand the data MUST ignore it;
   however, this memo at least defines a mechanism for including PIDF
   data, which XMPP applications are encouraged to implement if they
   desire to make use of PIDF data extensions for rich presence,
   geographical location, and other kinds of presence-related
   information.

3. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no action on the part of the IANA.

4. Security Considerations

   Detailed security considerations for XMPP are given in XMPP Core
   [XMPP-CORE].
