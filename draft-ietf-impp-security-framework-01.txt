Abstract

  This memo describes the security framework for the Instant
  Messaging and Presence Protocols.  It identifies the entities that
  use IMPP protocol elements, the trust relationships between them,
  security threats that are against which defence is to be provided,
  and the consequent security responsibilities of the active
  entities.  Specific cryptographic and other security mechanisms are
  NOT defined here.

  NOTE:  The security framework for IMPP is inherently bound up with
  the IMPP protocol design, and this memo is expected to evolve as
  decisions are made about the protocol design.  In its current form,
  this memo makes some assumptions about the IMPP structure that must
  be reviewed as design proceeds.

2. Participating entities

2.1 Presence service

  PRESENTITY - a client that is the origin of presence information.

  WATCHER - a client that consumes presence information

  PRESENCE SERVICE - a service (e.g. a server or collection of
  servers) that communicates presence information between PRESENTITYs
  and WATCHERS, and also gathers and distributes watcher information.

     +------------+
     |  PRESENCE  |
     |  SERVICE   |
     |            |
     |  +------+  |   (presence information)    +------------+

  This diagram shows a "typical" arrangement with a PRESENTITY
  publishing presence information, a WATCHER from a different domain
  observating that presence information, and a watcher (possibly for
  the same PRINCIPAL as the original PRESENTITY) observing who is
  watching PRESENTITIES presence information.

<draft-ietf-impp-security-framework-01.txt>


  For the purposes of this architecture, watcher information is
  treated ike another form of presence information, so a agent that
  observes watcher information is just another WATCHER.

  A key element of this architecture is that inter-domain
  communications are intermediated by a DOMAIN SERVER.  This is
  modelled as a single server, but this is not to preclude
  distributed server implementatons that are outside the scope of
  these IMPP specifications.

2.2 Instant Messaging service

  SENDER - a client that sends an instant message.

  INSTANT INBOX - a client that receives an instant message.

  INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE - a service (e.g. a server or collection of
  servers) that transfers instant messages between SENDERs and
  INSTANT INBOXes, and also determines and reports message transfer
  status information.

     |  |      | ---------------->------------- |         |
     |  +------+  |                             +---------+

     |  |SERVER|  |                             | INBOX   |

     |            |
     +------------+

  This diagram shows a "typical" arrangement with a SENDER sending an
  instant message, and an INSTANT INBOX receiving that message and
  returning confirmation back to the sender.

  As for presence information, inter-domain communications are
  intermediated by a DOMAIN SERVER.  This is modelled as a single
  server, but this is not to preclude distributed server
  implementatons that are outside the scope of these IMPP
  specifications.


3. Trust model

  (T1)    The network is not trusted.  Information in transit may be
          subject to snooping or tampering.

3.1 Presence service

  [[[This is a strawman, selected for simplicity.  Actual trust
  relationships will need to be determined.]]]

  (TP1)   PRESENCE SERVICE does not trust PRESENTITY to provide
          correct identity.

  (TP2)   PRESENCE SERVICE trusts PRESENTITY to provide correct
          presence information.

  (TP3)   PRESENTITY trusts the PRESENCE SERVICE to disclose presence
          information to authorized parties only.

  (TP4)   PRESENTITY trusts the PRESENCE SERVICE to distribute
          presence information uncorrupted.

  (TP5)   PRESENTITY trusts the PRESENCE SERVICE to provide correct
          watcher information.

  (TP6)   PRESENCE SERVICE does not trust WATCHER to provide correct
          identity.

  (TP7)   PRESENCE SERVICE does not trust WATCHER to respect
          confidentiality and privacy concerns.

  (TP8)   WATCHER trusts PRESENCE SERVICE to provide correct presence
          information.

  (TP9)   WATCHER trusts the PRESENCE SERVICE to disclose watcher
          information to authorized parties only.

  (TP10)  WATCHER trusts PRESENCE SERVICE to provide correct watcher
          information.

3.2 Instant Messaging service

  [[[This, too, is a strawman, selected for simplicity.  Actual trust
  relationships will need to be determined.]]]

  (TM1)   INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE does not trust SENDER to provide
          correct identity.

  (TM2)   SENDER trusts the INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE to disclose
          instant message and associated information to authorized
          parties only.

  (TM3)   SENDER trusts the INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE to distribute
          instant message uncorrupted.

  (TM4)   SENDER trusts the INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE to provide correct
          message status information.

  (TM5)   INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE does not trust INSTANT INBOX to
          provide correct identity.  [[[How does INSTANT MESSAGE
          SERVICE get information about INSTANT INBOX?]]]

  (TM6)   INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE does not trust INSTANT INBOX to
          respect confidentiality and privacy constraints.

  (TM7)   INSTANT INBOX trusts INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE to provide
          correct instant message information.

  (TM8)   INSTANT INBOX trusts the INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE to disclose
          message disposition and status information to the sender
          only (and other authorized parties?).

  (TM9)   INSTANT INBOX trusts INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE to deliver
          messages only from authorized senders.


4. Security threats and requirements

  [[[Some general goals and threats not covered explicitly by the
  requirements document...]]]

  (R1)    Privacy:  protections should exist against unauthorized
          disclosure of personal information.

  (R2)    Authenticity:  identities of the participating PRINCIPALs
          should be verified.  This implies that protocol handling
          agents must provide information to allow the origin of
          information or requests to be authenticated.

Security Framework for IMPP                               7 March 2000
<draft-ietf-impp-security-framework-01.txt>


  (R3)    Denial of service:  possibilities for external parties to
          impair the service to legitimate participants should be
          minimized.  [[[Need to identify specific DoS attacks?]]]

  (R4)    Denial of participation, fair play:  participants should be
          required to meet all protocol participation requirements, or
          not be permitted to participate.  [[[Is this really relevant
          for this application?]]]

4.1 Presence service

  [[[From [2], section 5.3...]]]

  (RP1)   PRESENTITY must be able to control disclosure of its
          presence information.  [2, sections 5.3.1-3]

  (RP2)   The PRINCIPAL controlling a PRESENTITY determines which
          other PRINCIPALs may update the presence information.
          Access control decisions are made independently of the
          presence of a PRESENTITY [[[Is this really in scope?  It
          describes UA rather than protocol behaviour.]]]

  [[[From [2], section 5.5...]]]

  (RP3)   Capability to protect PRESENCE INFORMATION against tampering
          or corruption.

  (RP4)   Capability to protect PRESENCE INFORMATION against replay by
          a third party.

  (RP5)   Capability to protect confidentiality of PRESENCE
          INFORMATION.

  [[[Watcher information -- seems not to be covered by reqs?]]]

4.2 Instant Messaging service

  [[[From [2], section 5.3...]]]

  (RM1)   PRINCIPAL controlling an INSTANT INBOX determines who can
          send messages to it.  This implies that protocol handling
          agents must record access control information and provide
          for testing of authenticated message identifies.

  (RM2)   The PRINCIPAL controlling an INSTANT INBOX determines which
          other PRINCIPALs may read messages from it.  [[[Is this
          really in scope?  It describes UA rather than protocol
          behaviour.]]]

  (RM3)   Capability to protect INSTANT MESSAGE against tampering or
          corruption.

  (RM4)   Capability to protect INSTANT MESSAGE against replay by a
          third party.

  (RM5)   Capability to protect confidentiality of INSTANT MESSAGE.


5. Trust boundaries and security responsibilities

  The parts of the PRESENCE SERVICE that interface with PRESENTITYs
  and/or WATCHERs span trust boundaries.

  Similarly, the parts of the INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE that interface
  with SENDERs and/or INSTANT INBOXes span trust boundaries.

5.1 Privacy

  From (R1), (T1), (TP3), (TP7), (TM1), (TM8).

  PRESENTITY may disclose presence information to authenticated
  PRESENCE SERVICE.

  PRESENCE SERVICE must enforce disclosure of presence information to
  only authorized, authenticated WATCHERs.

  PRESENCE SERVICE must enforce disclosure of watcher information to
  only authorized, authenticated PRESENTITYs and WATCHERs.

  SENDER may disclose instant message to authenticated INSTANT
  MESSAGE SERVICE.

  INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE must enforce disclosure of instant message
  information to only authorized, authenticated INSTANT INBOXes.

  INSTANT INBOX may disclose instant message disposition information
  to authenticated INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE.

  Privacy-sensitive information should (optionally) be encrypted for
  network transfers.  (But note that traffic analysis may still
  uncover the identity of an active PRESENTITY, WATCHER, SENDER or
  INSTANT INBOX.)

<draft-ietf-impp-security-framework-01.txt>


5.2 Authenticity

  From (R2), (T1), (TP1), (TP3), (TP6), (TM1), (TM2), (TM5)

  PRESENTITY must provide proof of identity to PRESENCE SERVICE.

  WATCHER must provide proof of identity to PRESENCE SERVICE.

  PRESENTITY or WATCHER must authenticate PRESENCE SERVICE before
  accepting presence or watcher information.

  SENDER must provide proof of identity to INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE.

  INSTANT INBOX must provide proof of identity to INSTANT MESSAGE
  SERVICE.

  INSTANT INBOX must authenticate INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE before
  accepting instant message information.

  SENDER must authenticate INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE before accepting
  message status information.

5.3 Denial of service

  PRESENTITY may restrict WATCHERs who are FETCHERs differently from
  WATCHERs who are SUBSCRIBERs.  (A high rate of fetches may
  constitute a denial of service attack.)

  [[[Need more ideas about DoS attack modes]]]

5.4 Cheating

  From (R4).

  [[[This refers to security threats where a party participates in a
  protocol to obtain value without fulfilling its own obligations for
  participation.  For example, a payment protocol that allowed goods
  to be delivered before an untrusted party made irrevocable
  commitment to payment would be somewhat flawed.]]]

  There are currently no identified cheat modes.

5.5 Authorization to disclose presence information

  From (RP1), (T1), (TP1), (TP3)

  PRESENTITY must provide proof of identity to PRESENCE SERVICE.

  The PRESENCE SERVICE accepts changes for presence disclosure
  permissions only from the corresponding authenticated PRESENTITY.

Security Framework for IMPP                               7 March 2000
<draft-ietf-impp-security-framework-01.txt>


  The PRESENCE SERVICE must store presence disclosure permissions in
  a tamper-proof fashion, and disclose presence information only to
  authenticated WATCHERs in accordance with the corresponding
  permissions.

5.6 Authorization to update presence information

  From (RP2), (T1), (TP1), (TP2)

  PRESENTITY must provide proof of identity to PRESENCE SERVICE.

  The PRESENCE SERVICE accepts changes for presence update
  permissions only from the corresponding authenticated PRESENTITY.

  The PRESENCE SERVICE must store presence update permissions in a
  tamper-proof fashion, and accept presence update information only
  from authenticated PRESENTITYs in accordance with the corresponding
  permissions.

5.7 Integrity of presence information

  From (RP3), (T1), (TP2), (TP4)

  PRESENTITY must provide presence information to PRESENCE SERVICE in
  integrity-protected fashion.

  PRESENCE SERVICE must provide presence information to WATCHER in
  integrity-protected fashion.

       NOTE: because the entities here effectively trust each
       other to provide correct information, the integrity
       protection here does not need to be a full-blown
       authenticated integrity check.  For example, a randomly
       generated signing key generated by the sender of the
       information, or a checksum and randomly generated
       encrypting key generated by the receiver might be
       adequate.

       In some environments, a physically protected network
       might be considered adequate for this purpose.

5.8 No replay of presence information

  From (RP4), (T1), (TP3)

  PRESENTITY and PRESENCE SERVICE should implement mechanisms to
  prevent presence information from being recorded and replayed at a
  later date.

Security Framework for IMPP                               7 March 2000
<draft-ietf-impp-security-framework-01.txt>


  PRESENCE SERVICE and PRESENTITY should implement mechanisms to
  prevent presence information from being recorded and replayed at a
  later date.

       NOTE:  as the PRESENCE SERVICE is generally trusted by
       the other parties, authentication by the PRESENTITY and
       WATCHER are sufficient to realize these requirements.

5.9 Confidentiality of presence information

  From (RP5), (T1)

  PRESENTITY should send presence information only after
  authenticating the PRESENCE SERVICE.

  PRESENTITY should encrypt presence information sent to the PRESENCE
  SERVICE.

  PRESENCE SERVICE should send presence information only after
  authenticating the WATCHER.

  PRESENCE SERVICE should encrypt presence information sent to the
  WATCHER.

5.10 Authorization to send to inbox

  From (RM1), (TM1), (TM10).

  INSTANT INBOX (or PRINCIPAL) must provide proof of identity to
  INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE.

  The INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE accepts changes for inbox delivery
  permissions only from the corresponding authenticated INSTANT INBOX
  (or PRINCIPAL).

  The PRESENCE SERVICE must store instant message delivery
  permissions in a tamper-proof fashion, and deliver instant messages
  only from authenticated SENDERs in accordance with the
  corresponding permissions.

5.11 Authorization to receive inbox message

  From (RM2), ...

  [[[Need to clarify role of PRINCIPAL here.]]]

5.12 Integrity of instant message

  From (RM3), (T1), (TM3), (TM7)

  SENDER must provide instant message to INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE in
  integrity-protected fashion.

  INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE must deliver instant message to INSTANT
  INBOX in integrity-protected fashion.

       NOTE: because the entities here effectively trust each
       other to provide correct information, the integrity
       protection here does not need to be a full-blown
       authenticated integrity check.  See section 5.7.

5.13 No replay of instant message

  From (RM4), (T1), (TM2), (TM7).

  SENDER and INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE should implement mechanisms to
  prevent an instant message from being recorded and replayed at a
  later date.

  INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE and INSTANT INBOX should implement
  mechanisms to prevent an instant message from being recorded and
  replayed at a later date.

       NOTE:  as the INSTANT MESSAGE SERVICE is generally
       trusted by the other parties, authentication by the
       SENDER and INSTANT INBOX are sufficient to realize these
       requirements.

5.14 Confidentiality of inbox message

  From (RM5), (T1).

  SENDER should send instant message only after authenticating the
  INSTANT MESSAGING SERVICE.

  SENDER should encrypt instant message sent to the INSTANT MESSAGING
  SERVICE.

  INSTANT MESSAGING SERVICE should deliver instant message only after
  authenticating the INSTANT INBOX.

  INSTANT MESSAGING SERVICE should encrypt instant message delivered
  to the INSTANT INBOX.

  01a  07-Mar-2000  Incorporate initial review comments, mostly
                    editorial.  Extend description of participating
                    entities to show the role of domain servers in
                    handling inter-domain communications.

  TODO

  + Review component intereactions (section 2)

  + Update trust model (section 3)

  + Review security threats and requirements (section 4)

  + Update security responsibilities (section 5)

  + Say more about security considerations (section 6)?
