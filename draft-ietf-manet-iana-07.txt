Internet-Draft                 MANET-IANA                  November 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document enumerates several common IANA allocations for use by
   one or more protocols that conform to [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].  The
   following well-known numbers are required: a UDP port number, an IP
   protocol number, and a link-local multicast group address.  All
   interoperable protocols running on these well-known IANA allocations
   MUST conform to [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].  [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb]
   provides a common format that enables one or more protocols to share
   the IANA allocations defined in this document unambiguously.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  UDP Port Number

   MANET routers require a well-known UDP port number [IANAPort] to send
   and receive MANET routing protocol packets.  The title of this UDP
   port is "manet".  The value of this UDP port is TBD1.


4.  IP Protocol Number

   MANET routers require a well-known IP protocol number [IANAProtocol]
   to send and receive MANET routing protocol packets.  The title of
   this IP protocol number is "manet".  The value of this IP protocol
   number is TBD2.


5.  Link-local Multicast Group for MANET Routers

   MANET routers require a well-known link-local multicast address
   [RFC4291] to send and receive MANET routing protocol packets.  The
   name of the multicast address to reach link-local (LL) MANET routers
   is "LL-MANET-Routers".

   For IPv4, a well-known, link-local scope multicast address is
   required.  The address for LL-MANET-Routers is 224.0.0.TBD3 to appear
   in the [IANAv4Multicast] registry.

   For IPv6, a well-known, link-local scope multicast address is
   required.  The address for LL-MANET-Routers is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD4
   to appear in the [IANAv6Multicast] registry.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document enumerates several common IANA allocations for use by
   one or more protocols that conform to [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].
   Specifically, the following well-known numbers have been assigned: a
   UDP port (Section 3), an IP protocol number (Section 4), and a link-
   local multicast group address (Section 5).

   Action 1:

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the following
   assignments in the "PORT NUMBERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers

   sub-registry "WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBERS"

   Keyword Decimal Description References

   ------- ------- ----------- ----------

   manet TBD1/udp MANET Protocols [ietf-manet-iana]

   Action 2:

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the following
   assignments in the "PROTOCOL NUMBERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers

   sub-registry "WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBERS"

   Keyword Decimal Description References

   ------- ------- ----------- ----------

   manet TBD2 MANET Protocols [ietf-manet-iana]

   Action 3:

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the following
   assignments in the "Internet Multicast Addresses" registry located at

   http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses

   sub-registry 224.0.0.0 - 224.0.0.255 (224.0.0/24)

   Local Network Control Block Date registered"

   224.0.0.TBD3 LL-MANET-Routers [ietf-manet-iana]

   Action 4:

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the following
   assignments in the "INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION 6 MULTICAST ADDRESSES"
   registry located at

   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-multicast-addresses

   sub-registry "Fixed Scope Multicast Addresses"

   sub-sub-registry "Link-Local Scope"

   FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD4 LL-MANET-Routers [ietf-manet-iana]


7.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies only well-known number for protocols that
   conform to [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb], and it not does not specify the
   protocols that carry the information across the network.  Each
   protocol using these well-known numbers may have its own set of
   security issues, but those issues are not affected by using the IANA
   allocations specified herein.

   The security issues associated with possibly operating multiple
   cooperating protocols using the same IANA assignments (e.g.  UDP
   port) MUST be addressed in each protocols' specification.
