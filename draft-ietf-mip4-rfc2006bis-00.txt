Abstract

   This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with
   network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In
   particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the Mobile
   Node, Foreign Agent and Home Agent of the Mobile IP Protocol.

   This memo is intended to update and possibly obsolete RFC 2006,
   however, it is designed to be backward compatible.

1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [11], STD 16, RFC 1212 [12] and RFC 1215 [13].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC
        2578 [1], STD 58, RFC 2579 [3] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [4].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [6].  A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track pro-
        tocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [14] and RFC
        1906 [15].  The third version of the message protocol is called
        SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [15], RFC 2572 [16] and RFC
        2574 [8].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [6].  A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [7].

INTERNET DRAFT    Mobile IP MIB Definition using SMIv2    September 2003


    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [17] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [9].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [10].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2.  Objects

2.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

3.  Overview

3.1.  Object Selection Criteria

   To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering practice,
   the authors have applied some criteria to select managed objects for
   the Mobile IP Protocol.


   (1)  Partition management functionality among the Mobile Node, Home
        Agent, and Foreign Agent according to the partitioning seen in
        the Mobile IP Protocol.

INTERNET DRAFT    Mobile IP MIB Definition using SMIv2    September 2003


   (2)  Require that objects be essential for either fault or configura-
        tion management.

   (3)  Limit the total number of objects.

   (4)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in this
        or other MIBs.

3.2.  Structure of the Mobile IP

   This section describes the basic model of Mobile IP used in develop-
   ing the Mobile IP MIB. This information should be useful to the
   implementor in understanding some of the basic design decisions of
   the MIB.

   The Mobile IP Protocol introduces these new functional entities:

   Mobile Node

       A host or router that changes its point of attachment from one
       network or subnetwork to another.  A mobile node may change its
       location without losing connectivity and without changing its IP
       address; it may continue to communicate with other Internet nodes
       at any location using its (constant) IP address, assuming link-
       layer connectivity to a point of attachment is available.

   Home Agent

       A router on a mobile node's home network which tunnels packets
       for delivery to the mobile node when it is away from home, and
       maintains current location information for the mobile node.

   Foreign Agent

       A router on a mobile node's visited network which provides rout-
       ing services to the mobile node while registered.  The foreign
       agent detunnels and delivers packets to the mobile node that were
       tunneled by the mobile node's home agent. For datagrams sent by a
       mobile node, the foreign agent may serve as a default router for
       registered mobile nodes.

   This document specifies the objects used in managing these entities;
   namely, the Mobile Node, the Home Agent, and the Foreign Agent.

3.3.  MIB Groups

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is orga-
   nized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and the

INTERNET DRAFT    Mobile IP MIB Definition using SMIv2    September 2003


   relationship between groups and the Mobile IP entities are shown
   below:

           Groups            Mobile Node  Foreign Agent  Home Agent
      mipSystemGroup            X               X             X
      mipSecAssociationGroup    X               X             X
      mipSecViolationGroup      X               X             X
      mnSystemGroup             X
      mnDiscoveryGroup          X
      mnRegistrationGroup       X
      maAdvertisementGroup                      X             X
      faSystemGroup                             X
      faAdvertisementGroup                      X
      faRegistrationGroup                       X
      haRegistrationGroup                                     X
      haRegNodeCountersGroup                                  X

3.4.  Protocol Extensions

   Apart from changes to base specification of Mobile IP [24], it has
   been enhanced in number of ways through its ability for added capa-
   bilities.  Implementations of those capabilities have not been able
   to have any management capabilities present in RFC 2006 compliant MIB
   module agents, since the capabilities themselves postdated the adop-
   tion of RFC 2006.  For several significant capabilities, in the form
   of NAI extension [21], Challenge/Response Extensions [22], Reverse
   Tunneling [23], and Vendor/Organization-Specific Extensions [25], the
   MIB Module defined in this document exposes object types to manage
   those extended capabilities and their operation.

   NAI extension requires a thorough redefinition of MIB table row
   indices from the RFC 2006 state since it provides a one more way to
   identify the mobile nodes apart from home address.  The functional
   differences between this memo and RFC 2006 are explained in Appendix
   A.

   aged Objects for IP Mobility Support using SMIv2" written by D. Cong,
   M. Hamlen and  C. Perkins. The editor wishes to acknowledge the good
   work of these original authors.  Thanks to Roy Jose, Rudreshwar N, 
   Basavaraj Patil, and Sri Gundavelli for their useful comments and
   contributions.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure envi-
   ronment without proper protection can have a negative effect on net-
   work operations.

   The Mobile IP MIB affords the network operator the ability to config-
   ure and control the Mobile IP links of a particular system, including
   the Mobile IP authentication protocols, and shared secret key.  This
   represents a security risk.

   These risks are addressed in the following manners:

   (1)  All variables which represent a significant security risk are
        placed in separate MIB Groups.  By providing Agent Capability
        Statements, the implementor of the MIB may elect not to imple-
        ment these groups.

   (2)  The MIB allows the manager station to create the security asso-
        ciation for Mobile IP entities.  However, the agent should
        always return 0 length octet string when the manager station
        retrieves the shared security key in the mipSecAssocTable.  In
        this way, the Mobile IP entities can prevent the key leaking
        from SNMP GET, GET-NEXT, or GET-BULK requests.

   (3)  The MIB defines a trap for Mobile IP entities to send a notifi-
        cation to the manager station if there is a security violation.
        In this way, the operator can notice the source of an intruder.

   (4)  The MIB also defines a table to log the security violations in
        the Mobile IP entities.  The manager station can retrieve this
        log to analyze the security violation instances in the system.

   Thus, in order to preserve the integrity, security and privacy of the
   Mobile IP security features, an implementation SHOULD allow access to
   this MIB only via SNMPv3.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and



Rathi                                                          [Page 77]


INTERNET DRAFT    Mobile IP MIB Definition using SMIv2    September 2003


   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security fea-
   tures as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of
   the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [8] and the View-based Access
   Control Model RFC 2575 [9] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/cre-
   ate/delete) them.

A.  Changes from RFC 2006 to draft-ietf-mobileip-rfc2006bis-00.txt

   A.1 The changes from RFC 2006 are the following:

   -  Section "The Network Management Framework" was updated.
   -  Subsection Protocol Extensions was created under section Overview.
   -  Section Security Considerations was updated.
   -  Changes to the MIB definition are following.  Changes are listed
      in the order of their occurrence in the MIB definition.

   (1)  The textual convention RegistrationFlags was updated.  The bit
        for VJ compression was removed and bit for reverse tunneling was
        added.

   (2)  Three new textual conventions were added : MipEntityIdentifier-
        Type, MipEntityIdentifier and MipEntityIdentifierNAI.  These
        textual conventions were defined to take into account that
        mobile nodes can be identified by other than ipaddress.

   (3)  New textual convention MipDeliveryStyle was added to represent
        the delivery style requested by mobile node in the registration
        request.

   (4)  mipSecAssocTable was deprecated and replaced with mipSecurityAs-
        socTable to support the mobile nodes identified by NAI.  Indices
        of the table were changed.  mipSecurityStatus object was added



Rathi                                                          [Page 80]


INTERNET DRAFT    Mobile IP MIB Definition using SMIv2    September 2003


        to manage the creation of new security associations in the
        table.  Default value clause was added to following three
        objects of the new table.
        - mipSecurityAlgorithmType
        - mipSecurityAlgorithmMode
        - mipSecurityReplayMethod

        hmac was added to the enumeration list of
        mipSecurityAlgorithmMode object.

   (5)  A new object mipSecurityAssocsCount was added.  This gives the
        number of security associations in the mipSecurityAssocTable.

   (6)  mipSecViolationTable was deprecated and replaced with mipSecuri-
        tyViolationTable to support the mobile nodes identified by NAI.
        Indices of the table were changed.  The objects corresponding to
        mipSecRecentViolationIDLow and mipSecRecentViolationIDHigh in
        the new table are changed to have the syntax of Unsigned32
        instead of Integer32.

        dynamic home address assignment and default value clause was
        added.

   (8)  Two new objects mnIdentifierType and mnIdentifier were added to
        the mnSystem group.

   (9)  object mnAdvFlags was refined.  The bit for VJ compression was
        removed and bit for reverse tunneling was added.

   (10) Lower limit of value-range for objects mnAdvMaxRegLifetime and
        mnAdvMaxAdvLifetime is changed to 1 from 0.

   (11) A new object mnRegDeliveryStyle was added to the mnRegistra-
        tionTable

   (12) maAdvConfigTable was deprecated and replaced with maAdvertCon-
        fTable to support configuration of advertisement parameters on
        unnumbered interfaces.  Index of the table was changed.  A new
        object maAdvertService was added to maAdvertConfTable to indi-
        cate the mobility services offered on the network interface.

   (13) objects faIsBusy and faRegistrationRequired were deprecated and
        replaced with faAdvertConfTable.  This is to allow for different
        settings of 'B' and 'R' bit on different network interfaces.

   (14) A new object faChallengeWindow was added to the faAdvertCon-
        fTable to allow for configuration of challenge window.
