        RFC 7258 additions due to evolving Internet thread model
           draft-arkko-farrell-arch-model-t-7258-additions-02

Abstract

   Communications security has been at the center of many security
   improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that
   communications are protected against outside observers and attackers.

   RFC 7258 is the IETF guidance on taking into account pervasive
   monitoring threats in Internet technology development work.  This
   memo suggests additions to RFC 7258 to cater for the evolving
   threats.  For instance, it may be necessary to also worry about
   information collected by a legitimate protocol participant being
   misused for pervasive monitoring purposes.

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   Communications security has been at the center of many security
   improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that
   communications are protected against outside observers and attackers.
   At the IETF, this approach has been formalized in BCP 72 [RFC3552],
   which defined the Internet threat model in 2003.  Additional guidance
   to take into account dangers posed by pervasive monitoring were
   covered in BCP 188 [RFC7258].

   However, threats in the Internet continue to evolve, as discussed in
   [I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t-redux].

   The rest of this document tentatively suggests a small (but our view,
   important) change to the BCP.

   Comments are solicited on this document.  The best place for
   discussion is on the model-t list.

2.  Potential Changes in BCP 188/RFC 7258

   Additional guidelines may be necessary also in BCP 188/RFC
   7258[RFC7258], which specifies how IETF work should take into account
   pervasive monitoring.

   An initial, draft suggestion for starting point of those changes
   could be adding the following paragraph after the 2nd paragraph in
   Section 2:

   NEW:

      PM attacks include those cases where information collected by a
      legitimate protocol participant is misused for PM purposes.  The
      attacks also include those cases where a protocol or network
      architecture results in centralized data storage or control
      functions relating to many users, raising the risk of said misuse.

3.  Security Considerations

   The entire memo covers the security considerations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this work.
