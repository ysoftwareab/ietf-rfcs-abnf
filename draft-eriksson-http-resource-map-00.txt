                             Resource Maps
                  draft-eriksson-http-resource-map-00

Abstract

   When the 'out-of-band' content coding ('OOB') is used for delivering
   a number of resources from a primary server via a secondary server,
   the additional round trips for OOB responses and load on the primary
   server can be a significant nuisance.

   In such situations, it is useful for the primary server to be able to
   provide the client with OOB response information for several
   resources in one go anticipating future client requests.

   This document describes a format for providing the client with the
   information, called a resource map, and how the resource map could be
   delivered to a client.

Internet-Draft                Resource Maps                 October 2016


1.  Introduction

   The mechanisms outlined in "An Architecture for Secure Content
   Delegation using HTTP" [SCD] and "Caching Secure HTTP Content using
   Blind Caches" [BC] use the 'out-of-band' content coding ('OOB')
   mechanism [OOBENC] to delegate the delivery of requested resource
   from a primary server to one or several secondary servers.

   A primary server might decide to delegate the delivery of response
   payload for a set of resources, for instance individual video
   segments, or a set of images or parts of a large file.

   In one approach the client sends individual requests for each of the
   resources to the primary server which provides the OOB content coding
   response information for the requested resources as meta data in each
   and every request to the primary server.  This approach adds a
   minimum of one extra RTT (round trip time) for each request before
   the client can send the request to the desired secondary server.

   In another approach the primary server anticipates a client's
   requests, for instance leveraging object dependency graph
   information, to provide the client with OOB content coding
   information for the subsequent requests in advance of requests.

   This document describes a format for providing the client with the
   information for multipe OOB responses, called a resource map, and how
   the information is delivered to a client.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Basic procedure for providing a Resource Map

   A primary server creates a resource map containing information about
   how a set of resources on the origin it serves maps to a set of
   resource locations on one or multiple secondary servers.

   [OOBENC] describes the basic procedure for providing the client with
   the OOB response meta data for an individual request, as examplified
   below:

   Client request of a resource:

     GET /test HTTP/1.1
     Host: www.example.com
     Accept-Encoding: gzip, out-of-band


   Response from primary server:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Date: Thu, 14 May 2015 18:52:00 GMT
     Content-Type: text/plain
     Cache-Control: max-age=10, public
     Content-Encoding: out-of-band
     Content-Length: 165
     Vary: Accept-Encoding

     {
       "sr": [
         { "r" :
           "http://example.net/bae27c36-fa6a-11e4-ae5d-00059a3c7a00"},
         { "r" :
           "/c/bae27c36-fa6a-11e4-ae5d-00059a3c7a00"}
       ]
     }

   A primary server can provide a Resource Map location in any response
   to a request for any resource using a Link header field [RFC5988] --
   this can be an OOB response like the one above, but doesn't need to.

     Link: </map>; rel="http://purl.org/NET/linkrel/resource-map"

   Note that in this example, "/map" is a relative reference identifying
   the resource map (relative to the request URI), and
   "http://purl.org/NET/linkrel/resource-map" is the identifier for the
   link relation "resource map".

   A primary server can speculatively anticipate a client requesting a
   Resource Map and MAY use HTTP/2 [RFC7540] to push the response with
   the Resource Map to the client to decrease the extra delay a request
   for resource map otherwise would incur.

   The basic operation for providing the client with a Resource Map is
   as follows:

   1.  Client requests resource from primary.  Request includes Accept-
       Encoding header field including "out-of-band".
   2.  Primary server response includes Link header field identifying
       the resource map.

Internet-Draft                Resource Maps                 October 2016


   3.  Client retrieves the resource map.
   4.  Resource Map becomes stale and will be retrieved again.


3.  Updating the Resource Map

3.1.  Primary server need to update Resource Map

   Depending on the nature of the application and the resources, the
   primary server's need to provide the client with updates of the
   resource map information vary.  In some cases there is no or little
   need for updates, in others there may be reasons for more frequent
   updates.

   For instance, delegation information for static resources such as
   banners, images and script libraries for analytics might not change.
   In such a situation, the primary server does not need to stay in
   touch with the client to provide it with updates.

   In another use case, the primary server provides the client with
   updates, for instance changing the secondary servers to be used by a
   mobile client.

   Basically there are four approaches for a primary server to provide a
   client with updates to a resource map:

   o  Piggyback signal about update on response to request from client
   o  Client subscribes to Web Push updates
   o  Client receives continuous updates
   o  Resource Map validity time-out

3.2.  Piggyback

   A primary server MAY add an Link header field to any response to a
   client.  A client receiving a response with a Link header MUST
   retrieve the Resource Map web resource and process it.

3.3.  Using Web Push

   A primary server MAY add an indication in the Resource Map to the
   client to use a notification service to receive updates to a Resource
   Map. When present a client SHOULD register for notifications.

   A client receiving a Resource Map update notification MUST retrieve
   the Resource Map using the location information in the notification.

Internet-Draft                Resource Maps                 October 2016


3.4.  Continuous Updates

   In some situations, it is desirable to provide the client with a
   stream of Resource Map updates.  Depending on the client type, either
   a secure bi-directional transport protocol is used, such as
   WebSocket, or the client is instructed to poll for changes.

   A primary server MAY add an indication to the client to either poll
   or use a stream oriented protocol for receiving intermittent,
   frequent updates.

3.5.  Resource Map Timer

   The freshness of a Resource Map can be given by the 'ma' timer.  When
   expired, the OOB delegation is not valid and the client MUST request
   an update from the primary server (this duplicates HTTP cache
   information, but might become important when the resource map is
   transmitted over a protocol other than HTTP).

3.6.  Resource Map compression

3.6.1.  gzip

   A resource map might be large.  For this reason a client can use
   compression content codings such as 'gzip' to decrease the size.

3.6.2.  Formulas

   When using the resource map, the primary server could use a template
   or formula to optimize the size of the resource map information.  For
   example, using URI templates [RFC6570], and an agreed upon HMAC of
   the path postfix, it would be possible to specify a mapping for many
   URIs at once.


   originURI =
     "https://{origin}/images/{postfix}
   mappedURI =
     "https://cch.example.com/{origin}/images/{hmac-of-postfix}

   ...would indicate a mapping for any https URI on "origin" below a
   root path of "/images/", where the mapped URI would be constructed by
   concatenating "https://cch.example.com/", the origin's host name,
   "/images/", and a base64- or hex-encoded opaque part, computed based
   on the remainder of the origin URI's path.

4.  The Resource Map format

4.1.  Definitions

   A resource map will use and extend attributes outlined in [OOBENC] as
   well as additional extension attributes to be defined later.

   The format of the resource map uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON,
   [RFC7159]) describing a set of objects:

   o  Objects for describing handling of updates of a resource map.
   o  Objects for describing secondary servers and which resources that
      are mapped.
   o  Objects for describing the resources on the secondary servers.

   {
       "resource-map-updates" : {

           //Information about resource map updates.

       },

       "secondary-servers" : {

           //Information about secondary servers.

       },

       "resources" : [

           //Information about resources on secondary servers.

       ]
   }

4.2.  Updates for Resource Map

           },

               "poll" : {
                   "intervall" : [ ]   //Poll
               }
               "connect" : [  ]  // TODO: Relation to URL in Link <map>?
           },
   }

4.3.  Secondary Servers and Mapping of Resources

   [[anchor17: Details to be done.]]


5.  Security Considerations

   All the considerations of [OOBENC] and [SCD] apply.

   A resource map can be used to cause the client to request malicious
   content or perform DoS attacks on a victim secondary server.  Clients
   MUST verify the identity of server providing the Resource Map.

   In the case the resource map is delivered as a separate Web resource,
   the client MUST verify that the server providing the resource map
   belong to the same authority as the primary server.

   The secondary server SHOULD take actions to detect and manage request
   loops caused by erroneous request from a client.

   [[anchor19: TODO: Using tokens for access control to secondary.]]
   [[anchor20: Issue: A resource map attribute that is applicable for a
   set of resources may open up for mixed attacker-controlled data and
   secrets.]]

Appendix A.  Multiple Secondary Servers

   A primary server can provide multiple secondary servers for
   retrieving a resource or set of resources.

   A Resource Map for the case when resources on
   "https://origin.example.com:8080" are mapped to two different
   secondary servers:
