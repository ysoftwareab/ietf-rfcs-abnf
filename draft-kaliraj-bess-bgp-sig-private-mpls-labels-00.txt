Abstract

   The MPLS-forwarding-layer in a core network is a shared resource.
   The MPLS FIB at nodes in this layer contains labels that are
   dynamically allocated and locally significant at that node.

   For some usecases like upstream-label-allocation, it is useful to be
   able to create virtual private MPLS-forwarding-layers over this
   shared MPLS-forwarding-layer.  This allows installing deterministic
   private label-values in the private-FIBs created at nodes
   participating in this private MPLS forwarding-layer, while preserving
   the "locally significant" nature of the underlying shared 'public'
   MPLS-forwarding-layer.

   This specification describes the procedures to create such virtual
   private MPLS-forwarding layers (private MPLS-planes) using a new BGP
   family.  And gives a few example use-cases on how this private
   forwarding-layers can be used.

Internet-Draft        Private MPLS-label namespaces            June 2017


1.  Introduction

   The MPLS-forwarding-layer in a core network is a shared resource.
   The MPLS FIB at nodes in this layer contains labels that are
   dynamically allocated and locally significant at that node.

   For some usecases like upstream-label-allocation, it is useful to be
   able to create virtual private MPLS-forwarding-layers over this
   shared MPLS-forwarding-layer.  This allows installing deterministic
   private label-values in the private-FIBs in this private forwarding-
   layer, while preserving the "locally significant" nature of the
   underlying shared 'public' MPLS-forwarding-layer.

   It can be noted that, mechanism described in this document is nothing
   but a [RFC-4364] style BGP VPN where the FEC is MPLS-Label, instead
   of IP-prefix.  This document defines new address-families (AFI: MPLS,
   SAFI: VPN-Unicast, Unicast) and associated signaling mechanisms to
   create and use MPLS forwarding-contexts in a network.  The concepts
   of MPLS-Context-tables and upstream allocation are described in [RFC-
   5331].

   BGP speakers participating in the private MPLS FIB layer create
   instances of "MPLS forwarding-context" FIBs, which are identified
   using a "Context-Protocol-Nexthop (CPNH)".  A Context-label MAY be
   advertised in conjunction with the Context Protocol Nexthop (CPNH)
   using new BGP address-family to other speakers.

2.  Motivation

   A provider's core network consists of a global-domain (default
   forwarding-tables in P and PE nodes) that is shared by all tenants in
   the network and may also contain multiple private user-domains (e.g.
   VRF route tables).

   The global MPLS forwarding-layer can be viewed as the collection of
   all default MPLS forwarding-tables.  This global MPLS Fib layer
   contains labels locally significant to each node.  The "local-
   significance of labels" gives the nodes freedom to participate in
   MPLS-forwarding with whatever label-ranges they can support in
   forwarding hardware.

   In emerging usecases some applications using the MPLS-network may
   benefit from a "static labels" view of the MPLS-network.  In some
   other usecases, a standard mechanism to do Upstream label-allocation
   is beneficial.

   It is desirable to leave the global MPLS FIB layer intact, and build
   private MPLS FIB-layers on top of it to achieve these requirements.

Internet-Draft        Private MPLS-label namespaces            June 2017


   The private-MPLS-FIBs can then be used by the applications as
   desired.  The private MPLS-FIBs need to be created only at the nodes
   in the network where predictable label-values (external label
   allocation) is desired.  E.g.  P-routers that need to act as a
   "Detour-nodes" or "Service-Forwarding-Helpers" that need to mirror
   service-labels.

   In other words, provisioning of these private MPLS-FIBs can be
   gradual and can co-exist with nodes not supporting the feature
   described in this document.  These private-MPLS-FIBs can be stitched
   together using either the Context-labels over the existing shared
   MPLS-network tunnels, or 'private' context-interfaces - to form the
   "private MPLS-FIB layer".

   An application can then install the routes with desired label-values
   in the private forwarding-contexts with desired forwarding-semantics.

3.  Constructs and building blocks

   The building-blocks that construct a private MPLS plane are described
   in this section.

3.1.  Context Protocol Nexthop Address

   A private MPLS plane (just "MPLS plane" here-after) is identified by
   an IP-address called Context Protocol Nexthop (CPNH).  This address
   is unique in the core-network, like any other loopback address.

   A loopback-address uniquely identifies a specific node in the
   network, and we call it Global Protocol Nexthop (GPNH) in this
   document.  The CPNH address uniquely identifies a "MPLS-plane".

   Each node that has forwarding-context for a MPLS-plane MUST be
   configured with the same CPNH but a different RD, such that the
   RD:CPNH will uniquely identify that node in the MPLS-plane.

3.2.  MPLS context FIB

   An instance of a MPLS forwarding-table at a node in the private MPLS-
   plane.  This Private MPLS FIB contains the private-label routes.

   A node can have context-FIB for multiple MPLS-planes.  The same
   label-value can have a different forwarding-semantic in each MPLS-
   plane.  Thus the applications using that MPLS-plane get a
   deterministic label-value independent of other applications using
   other MPLS-planes.

Internet-Draft        Private MPLS-label namespaces            June 2017


   The terms "private MPLS FIB-layer" and "private MPLS-plane" are used
   interchangeably in this document.

3.3.  Context Label

   A context-label is a non-reserved dynamically allocated label, that
   is installed in the global MPLS FIB, and points to a MPLS-Context-
   FIB.  The Context-Label have forwarding semantics as follows in the
   global MPLS-FIB:

   Context-Label -> Pop and Lookup in MPLS-Context-Fib

   Advertising the "Context-Label in conjunction with the GPNH" tells
   the network how to reach a "RD:CPNH".

3.4.  Roles of nodes in a MPLS-plane

   The node roles in a MPLS-plane can be classified into "edge nodes"
   (call them PLER) or "transit-nodes" (call them PLSR).

3.4.1.  Edge-nodes (PLER)

   Private Label Edge-routers (PLER) have MPLS context-FIB that belong
   to the MPLS-plane.  They advertise the presence of this context-FIB,
   and private-label routes from this FIB, using new BGP AFI/SAFI
   described in this document.

3.4.2.  Transit-nodes (PLSR)

   Private Label Transit-nodes do label-swap forwarding for the Context-
   Labels they see in the Context-Protocol-Nexthop advertisement routes
   going thru them.  They basically stitch/extend the label switched
   path to a RD:CPNH when they re-advertise the CPNH routes with
   nexthop-self.

   PLSRs dont have context-FIBs.  PLSRs dont have Context Protocol-
   Nexthop.  Because they dont have Private label routes to originate.

   However a node in the network can play both roles, of PLER and PLSR.

3.5.  Sending traffic into the MPLS plane

   MPLS-traffic arriving with private-labels hits the correct private
   MPLS-FIB by virtue of either arriving on a "private network-
   interface" that is attached to the FIB, or arriving on a shared
   network-interface with a "Context-label".

Internet-Draft        Private MPLS-label namespaces            June 2017


   To send data traffic into this private MPLS FIB-layer, the
   application MUST use as handle either a "Context-label" advertised by
   a node or a "Private-interface" owned by the application at the node.

   The Context-Label is the only label-value the application needs to
   learn from the network (PLER node it is connected to), to be able to
   use the private MPLS-plane.  The application can decide the value of
   the labels to be programmed in the private MPLS-FIBs.

   Once the packet enters the private MPLS plane at an edge-node (PLER),
   the node will forward the packet to the next node (PLSR or PLER), by
   pushing the Context-label advertised by that next-node, and the
   transport-label to reach that node's GPNH.  This will repeat until
   the packet reaches the private MPLS-FIB that originated that private
   MPLS-label.

   At each PLER in the MPLS-plane, the private-label value remains the
   same, and points towards the same resource attached to the MPLS-
   plane.  This allows the applications using the MPLS-network a static-
   labels view of the resourses attached to the private MPLS-plane.

   At each PLSR in the MPLS-plane, the context-label value will change
   (be swapped in forwarding), but is transparent to the application.

4.  Terminology

   P-router : A Provider core router, also called a LSR

   LSR : Label Switch Router (pure transport node speaking LDP, RSVP
   etc)

   PLSR: a transit node in a private MPLS-plane.  It has a forwarding-
   context for private-labels.

   PLER: an edge node in a private MPLS-plane.  It has a forwarding-
   context for private-labels.

   Detour-router : A P-router that is used as a loose-hop in a traffic-
   engineered path

   PE-router : Provider Edge router, that hosts a service (Internet,
   L3VPN etc)

   SE-router : Service Edge router.  Same as PE.

   SFH-router : Service Forwarding Helper.  A node helping an SE-router
   with service-traffic forwarding, using Service-routes mirrored by the
   SE.

   MPLS FIB : MPLS Forwarding table

   Global MPLS FIB : Global MPLS Forwarding table, to which shared-
   interfaces are connected

   Private MPLS FIB : Private MPLS Forwarding table, to which private-
   interfaces are connected

   Private MPLS FIB Layer : The group of Private MPLS FIBs in the
   network, connected together via Context-Labels

   Context-Label : Locally-significant Non-reserved label pointing to a
   private MPLS FIB

   Context nexthop IP-address (CPNH) : An IP-address that identifies the
   "Private MPLS FIB Layer".  RD:CPNH identifies a Private MPLS FIB at a
   node.

   Global nexthop IP-address (GPNH) : Global Protocol Nexthop address.
   E.g. a loopback address used as transport tunnel end-point.

5.  BGP families, routes and encoding

   This section describes the new constructs defined by this document.

5.1.  New address-families

   This document defines a new AFI: "MPLS".  And two new address-
   families.

5.1.1.  AFI: MPLS, SAFI: 128

   This address-family is used to exchange private label-routes into
   private MPLS-FIBs at routers that are connected using a common
   network-interface.

   Routes in this family contain Route-Target extended-community
   identifying the private-FIB-Layer (VPN) the route belongs to.  This
   address-family also advertises the Context-Label that the receiving
   router uses to access the private MPLS-FIB.  The Context-Label is
   required when the connecting-interface is a shared common interface
   that terminates into the global MPLS FIB.  The Context-Label
   installed in the global MPLS-FIB points to the private MPLS-FIB.

Internet-Draft        Private MPLS-label namespaces            June 2017


5.1.2.  AFI: MPLS, SAFI: 1

   This address-family is used to exchange private label-routes in
   private MPLS-FIBs to routers that are connected using a private
   network-interface.

   Because the interface is private, and terminates directly into the
   private MPLS-FIB, a Context-Label is not required to access the
   private MPLS-FIB.

5.2.  Routes and Operational procedures

5.2.1.  "Context-Nexthop" discovery route

   NLRI prefix


                    +--------------------------------------------+
                    |  Route Type = 1 (2 octets)                 |
                    +--------------------------------------------+
                    |  Route Distinguisher (RD) (8 octets)       |
                    +--------------------------------------------+
                    |  NH-Len in bits (1 octets)                 |
                    +--------------------------------------------+
                    |  Context-Nexthop IP-address                |
                    +--------------------------------------------+

   The Context-NH discovery route contains the following path-
   attributes:

   o  The BGP MultiNexthop-attribute [BGP_MULTI_NH] with forwarding-
      semantic:

      *  Push <Context-Label> to GPNH (for AFI, SAFI: "MPLS, VpnUni"),
         OR

      *  Forward to GPNH (for AFI, SAFI: "MPLS, Uni")

   o  Route-Target extended community, identifying the private FIB-layer

   MultiNexthop BGP-attribute


                    +--------------------------------------------+
                    |  MultiNH.NumNexthops = 1                   |
                    +--------------------------------------------+

                    +                                            +
                    |        Nexthop-Leg = (Context-Label, GPNH) |
                    +--------------------------------------------+

   The "Context-Nexthop discovery route" is originated by each speaker
   who acts as a PLER.  The "RD:Context-nexthop" uniquely identifies the
   private-FIB at the speaker.  The "Context-nexthop address" uniquely
   identifies the private-FIB-layer.

   A speaker (re)advertising a Context-Nexthop discovery-route with
   "next-hop self" MUST allocate a new Context-Label with a forwarding
   semantic of "Swap Received-Context-Label, Forward to Received-GPNH".
   This new Context-label along with self-GPNH is advertised in the
   Multinexthop-attribute [MULTI_NH] attached to the re-advertised
   Context-nexthop discovery route.

5.2.1.1.  Crossing Tunneled domain boundary

   "Nexthop-attributes" include BGP Nexthop attribute (code 3), Nexthop-
   field inside MP_Reach attribute (code 14) or the Multi-Nexthop BGP
   attribute (code TBD).  Two nodes are deemed to be in same tunneled-
   domain-boundary if they have some sort of transport-tunnel
   reachability between them (LDP, RSVP, BGP-LU).

   A node receiving a "Context-nexthop discovery route" MAY re-advertise
   it to other BGP speakers who have negotiated the address-family
   carrying the route.  While doing so, the node SHOULD NOT reset the
   RD:GPNH next-hop address carried in the "Nexthop-attributes" if the
   re-advertisement does not cross tunneled-domain boundaries.

   If a Context-nexthop discovery route is re-advertised across
   tunneled-domain-boundaries, the re-advertising node MUST set nexthop-
   address carried in the "Nexthop-attributes" to Self's GPNH, and
   allocate a new non-reserved label.  The route advertised further MUST
   carry a Multi-nexthop attribute with a forwarding semantic of:

   o  "SWAP <Received Context-Label> and Forward to Received-GPNH".

   This new-context-label is installed in the global MPLS FIB at the
   advertising node.  And is used as the Context-Label in the re-
   advertised RD:CPNH route's Multi-Nexthop attribute, with a
   forwarding-semantic of:

   o  "Push <New-Context-Label> and Forward to Advertising-GPNH"

   .

   A speaker MAY readvertise a private-label-route without changing the
   Nexthop (RD:CPNH) carried in it, if the speaker is a pure PLSR.

   If it does alter the nexthop to SelfRD:CPNH, it SHOULD act as a PLER,
   and for e.g. originate a "Context-Nexthop discovery route" for prefix
   "SelfRD:CPNH".

   Even if the speaker sets nexthop-address to Self because of regular
   BGP readvertisement-rules, new label MUST NOT be allocated, and the
   received NLRI "RD:Private-Label1" MUST be re-advertised as-is.  Such
   that value of label "Private-Label1" doesn't change while the packet
   traverses multiple nodes in the private-MPLS-FIB-layer.

   The Route-target attached to the route is the one identifying the
   private MPLS FIB layer (VPN).  The Private-label routes resolve over
   the Context-nexthop route that belong to the same VPN.

   A node receiving a "Private-Label route" RD:L1 MUST install the label
   L1 in the private MPLS Forwarding-context idenfied by the Route-
   Target attached to the route.

   The label route MUST be installed with forwarding-semantic as
   specified in the received Multi-nexthop attribute.  As an example, a
   Detour node MAY receive the private-label-route with a forwarding-
   semantic of "Forward to RD:CPNH" operation.  And an Egress node MAY
   receive a private-label-route with a forwarding-semantic pointing to
   a resource it houses.  Note that such a Private-label BGP-route MAY
   be received from external-application also.

5.2.2.1.  Resolving received Private Label-routes

   A node receiving a "Context-nexthop discovery route" MUST be capable
   of using either the CPNH or the RD:CPNH carried in the NLRI, to
   resolve other routes received with this CPNH address or RD:CPNH in
   the "Nexthop-attributes".

   The receiver of a private-label route MUST recursively resolve the
   received nexthop (RD:CPNH) over the Context-Nexthop discovery-route
   for prefix "RD:CPNH" to determine the label stack "Context-Label,
   Transport-Label" to push, so that the MPLS packet with private-label
   reaches the private MPLS FIB originating the route.

   If a node receives multiple "Context-nexthop discovery route" for a
   CPNH, it SHOULD run path-selection after stripping the RD, to find
   the closest ingress to the private-MPLS-plane identified by the CPNH.
   This best path SHOULD be used to resolve a received private-label-
   route.

6.  Example of Usecases

6.1.  Mezanine transport layer in a Seamless-MPLS network

   Typically service-routes in a MPLS network bind to the following
   entities that identify point-of-presence of a service:

   o  Protocol Nexthop - PE loopback address (GPNH)

   o  Service Label - PE advertised locally signifcant label that
      identifies the service

   In this model, whenever a PE is taken out of service the GPNH
   changes, and Service-Label changes - which causes maintenance a heavy
   convergence event.  Because the service-routes with massive-scale
   need to be readvertised with new service-label or PE-address.

   An alternate model could be: to advertise the Service-routes with a
   protocol-nexthop of CPNH (without RD), with a forwarding-semantic of:

   o  "Push <Private-Label>, and Forward to CPNH"

   This model fully decouples the service-layer from the transport-layer
   identifiers, by making the Service-routes refer to the CPNH and
   Private-Labels.  Thus the underlying transport-layer can change
   (nodes representing a Private-label can be added or removed) without
   any changes to the service-routes.  Which present good scaling
   properties for the network.

   This model also allows anycast traffic forwarding to any resource in
   the network.  Multiple PEs can advertise the same Private-Label to
   identify a specific service (e.g. peering with an AS) they are
   offering.

   Once the service-route traffic enters the private-FIB-layer, at the
   closest entry-point determined by path-selection of CPNH auto-
   discovery routes; then the Private-Labels (with pre-determined
   values) pushed will determine the loose hop path taken by the traffic
   and also the destination-resource.

6.2.  Service Forwarding Helper usecase

   In a virtualized environment a Service-PE node (that comprises of a
   vCP and multiple vFPs) can mirror MPLS labels (GL1) in its global
   MPLS-FIB to a private forwarding context at an upstream node (SFH)
   with information on which vFPs are optimal exit-points for that
   label.  Such that the SFH can optimally forward traffic to GL1 to the
   right vFPs, thus avoiding intra fabric traffic hops.

   To do this, the service-PE advertises a private-label route with
   RD:GL1 to the SFH node.  The route is advertised with a Multi-nexthop
   attribute with one or more legs that have a "Forward to SEPx"
   semantics.  Where SEPx is one of many exit-points at the Service-PE
   node.

6.3.  Standard BGP API to a MPLS network's forwarding-plane

   This mechanism facilitates predictable (external-allocator
   determined) label-values, using a standard BGP-family as the API.  It
   gives the external applications a separate MPLS-FIB to play with,
   totally separate from other applications.

   This also avoids vendor specific-API dependencies for external-
   allocators (controller softwares), and vice-versa.

   This mechanism also increases the overal MPLS label-space available
   in the network, because it creates per-app label-forwarding-contexts
   (namespaces), instead of reserving/splitting the global MPLS FIB
   among various applications.

6.4.  Traffic engineering and Security advantages

   o  Ability of ingress to steer mpls-traffic thru specific detour
      loose-hop nodes using predictable-labels' stack.

   o  Provide label-spoofing protection at edge-nodes - by virtue of
      using separate mpls-forwarding-contexts

   o  Allow private-MPLS label usage to spread across multiple-domains/
      AS and work seamlessly with existing technologies like Inter-AS
      VPN option C.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes following requests of IANA.

   New BGP AFI code:

   o  <TBD> for "MPLS"

   Which will be used to create new BGP AFI-SAFI pairs:

   o  MPLS Uni(SAFI:1),

   o  MPLS VpnUni(SAFI:128)

   .

   New NLRI Route-types for these AFI SAFIs:

   o  Type 1: Context-Nexthop-Discovery-route.

   o  Type 2: Private-Label route

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

8.  Security Considerations

   Using separate mpls-forwarding-contexts for separate applications and
   stitching them into separate MPLS-planes increases the security
   attributes of the MPLS network.
