                    OAuth 2.0 Device Posture Signals
                 draft-wdenniss-oauth-device-posture-00

Abstract

   Enterprise and security focused OAuth providers typically want
   additional signals to confirm user presence when users return to
   previously authorized apps.  Rather than requiring a full
   reauthentication, or require enrollment in a mobile device management
   solution, some authorization servers may be willing to accept device
   posture signals from the app, like the fact that device has a lock
   screen, as confirmation of user presence.  This document details how
   OAuth native app clients can communicate device posture signals to
   OAuth providers.

1.  Introduction

   Users who follow strong security practices on their devices - such as
   configuring screen locks, and not enabling admin privileges (commonly
   known as "rooting" or "jailbreaking") - shouldn't need to
   reauthenticate frequently to the individual apps on their device.

   This specification details how apps can send device posture signals
   to the OAuth Token Endpoint, enabling it to enforce device policy
   compliance, and avoid the need for reauthentication in some cases.

   It is designed to provide a mechanism for honest apps to communicate
   device posture.  By itself it doesn't protect against malicious
   users, dishonest apps, or compromised devices, but the signal format
   described could carry signals that do.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in Key
   words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels [RFC2119].  If
   these words are used without being spelled in uppercase then they are
   to be interpreted with their normal natural language meanings.

3.  Device Posture Signal Dictionary

   The device posture is a dictionary of signals asserted by the app
   about the device.  The structure is send as an added parameter in
   several places during the OAuth flow, as documented in the subsequent
   sections.

   All device posture keys are OPTIONAL and MUST only be set when the
   attribute can be obtained by the app.  The standard attribute keys
   are as follows:

   screen_lock
      Boolean.  True if the user has a screen lock, such as a pin,
      pattern biometric, etc.
   root_privileges
      Boolean.  True if user apps can access root device privileges.
      For mobile operating systems, known as "jailbreaking" on iOS and
      "rooting" on Android.
   device_attestation
      Dictionary.  An attestation from the operating system, containing
      a signed-statement about the device and/or the app.  The format is
      a dictionary, the specifics of which depends on the operating
      system.

   An example device posture dictionary:

   {
       "screen_lock": true,
       "root_privileges": false
   }

4.  Authorization Request Device Posture Hint

   Clients MAY send the device posture signal dictionary to the
   authorization server in the authorization request.  These signals,
   except for those that are signed and bound to the device are
   susceptible to client-side modification by end-users.  While
   untrusted, such signals can still be used as hints by the

   authorization server to present a better user experience, like
   informing the user they need a lock screen.

   Error encountered during authorization can be displayed to the user
   in the browser making this a more user friendly way to instruct the
   user on how to move their device into conformance.  The token
   endpoint (on which errors are less user-friendly as there's no user
   agent), can then enforce the restrictions per Section 5.

   The following parameters are added to the OAuth 2.0 Authorization
   Request:

   device_posture_hint
      JSON String.  URL-encoded JSON dictionary, contains the Device
      Posture Signals defined in Section 3.

5.  Token Endpoint Device Posture Enforcement

   Clients that follow this specification MUST send the device posture
   signals on every request to the token endpoint.

   Token Endpoints SHOULD verify that the posture conforms to their
   requirements and act accordingly.

   The following parameters are added to all requests to the Token
   Endpoint:

   device_posture
      JSON String.  URL-encoded JSON dictionary, contains the Device
      Posture Signals defined in Section 3.

   The app MUST obtain fresh device posture information before every
   request to the Token Endpoint, and MUST NOT include stale information
   (rather, it should drop any signals it cannot freshly obtain).

   For token refresh requests, where the device posture has been
   previously communicated, if an attribute is missing, the Token
   Endpoint may choose to use the previous value, based on it's own
   policy and freshness requirements.

   If the policy does not meet requirements, the Token Endpoint SHOULD
   return the following error code:

   device_posture_invalid
      Error indicating that the device posture does not meet
      requirements.  The error description SHOULD contain details on why
      this is is the case.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Device Posture Scope

   This specification is designed to help authorization servers enforce
   security policy (like requiring a lock screen) on end-users.  The
   intent is to enforce restrictions on honest users, to force them to
   follow security practices set out by the authorization server.  By
   itself, it offers no protection against malicious users, dishonest
   apps, or compromised devices.

   Combined with other technologies like device-based attestations and
   token binding may enable such protection, and this specification
   could be used to transmit secure signals, but that topic is out of
   scope for this specification.

6.2.  Spoofed Devices

   It is possible to at a device level completely spoof the device
   posture.  Even statements signed by the operating system are
   vulnerable to spoofing, as it's possible a statement from the real
   device can be replayed on a spoofed device, unless such statements
   include a binding to the device itself.  Per Section 6.1, this topic
   is out of scope for this specification.

6.3.  App Trustworthiness

   This specification is designed to allow trusted apps to report device
   posture to the authorization server to help the server enforce
   security policy on end-users.  It does not by itself force apps to be
   honest, or genuine.  Genuine apps (i.e. apps not lying about their
   client ID) might be dishonest about the device posture, and apps that
   are normally honest, could be spoofed, unless anti-spoofing
   countermeasures that are out of scope of this specification are
   employed.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  OAuth Parameters Registration

   This specification registers the following value in the IANA "OAuth
   Parameters" registry [IANA.OAuth.Parameters] established by
   [RFC6749].

7.1.1.  Registry Contents

   o  Parameter name: device_posture_hint
   o  Parameter usage location: authorization request
   o  Change controller: IESG
   o  Specification document(s): Section 4 of [[ this specification ]]

   o  Parameter name: device_posture
   o  Parameter usage location: token request
   o  Change controller: IESG
   o  Specification document(s): Section 5 of [[ this specification ]]

7.2.  OAuth Extensions Error Registration

   This specification registers the following error in the IANA "OAuth
   Extensions Error Registry" [IANA.OAuth.Parameters] established by
   [RFC6749].

7.2.1.  Registry Contents

   o  Error name: device_posture_invalid
   o  Error usage location: authorization response, token error response
   o  Related protocol extension: resource parameter
   o  Change controller: IESG
   o  Specification document(s): Section 5 of [[ this specification ]]

7.3.  Device Posture Keys Registry

   This specification establishes the IANA "Device Posture Keys"
   registry for Device Posture Dictionary keys.  The registry records
   the Device Posture key and a reference to the specification that
   defines it.  This specification registers the Device Posture keys
   defined in Section 3.

   Keys are registered on an Expert Review [RFC5226] basis after a
   three-week review period on the oauth-reg-review@ietf.org mailing
   list, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts.

   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
   an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register Device Posture
   Key: screen_lock").

   Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either approve
   or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the
   review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation and, if
   applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.
   Registration requests that are undetermined for a period longer than

   21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the
   iesg@ietf.org mailing list) for resolution.

   Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
   whether it is useful only for a single application, whether the value
   is actually being used, and whether the registration description is
   clear.

   IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts
   and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list.

   It is suggested that the same Designated Experts evaluate these
   registration requests as those who evaluate registration requests for
   the IANA "OAuth Parameters" registry [IANA.OAuth.Parameters].

7.3.1.  Registration Template

   Device Posture Signal Key:
      The key name requested (e.g., "screen_lock").  Names may not match
      other registered names in a case-insensitive manner unless the
      Designated Experts state that there is a compelling reason to
      allow an exception.
   Device Posture Signal Key Description:
      Brief description of the device posture signal (e.g., "Screen lock
      active").
   Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, state "IESG".  For others, give the name
      of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal address,
      email address, home page URI) may also be included.
   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document or documents that specify the parameter,
      preferably including URIs that can be used to retrieve copies of
      the documents.  An indication of the relevant sections may also be
      included but is not required.
