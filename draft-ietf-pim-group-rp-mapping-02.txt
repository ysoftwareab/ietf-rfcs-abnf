Internet-Draft           PIM Group-to-RP Mapping          September 2009


Abstract

   Each PIM-SM router in a PIM Domain which supports ASM maintains
   Group-to-RP mappings which are used to identify a RP for a specific
   multicast group.  PIM-SM has defined an algorithm to choose a RP from
   the Group-to-RP mappings learned using various mechanisms.  This
   algorithm does not allow administrator to override a specific Group-
   to-RP mapping with the static Group-to-RP mapping which an
   administrator would want to use.  This algorithm also does not
   consider the PIM mode and the mechanism through which a Group-to-RP
   mapping was learned.

   The intention of this document is to suggest a standard algorithm to
   deterministically choose between several group-to-rp mappings for a
   specific group.  This document first explains the requirements to
   extend the Group-to-RP mapping algorithm and then proposes the new
   algorithm.

Internet-Draft           PIM Group-to-RP Mapping          September 2009


1.  Introduction

   Multiple mechanisms exist today to create and distribute Group-to-RP
   mappings.  Each PIM-SM router may learn Group-to-RP mappings through
   various mechanisms.

   It is critical that each router select the same 'RP' for a specific
   multicast group address.  This is even true in the case of Anycast RP
   for redundancy.  Routers should select the same RP address to use for
   a given group address.  This RP address may correspond to a different
   physical router but it is one logical RP address and must be
   consistent across the PIM domain.  This is usually achieved by using
   the same algorithm to select the RP in all the PIM routers in a
   domain.

   PIM-SM[RFC4601] has defined an algorithm to select a 'RP' for a given
   multicast group address but it is not flexible enough for an
   administrator to apply various policies.  Please refer to section 3
   for more details.

   PIM-STD-MIB [RFC5060] has defined an algorithm that allows
   administrators to override Group-to-RP mappings with static
   configuration.  But this algorithm is not completely deterministic,
   because it includes an implementation-specific 'precedence' value.

   Embedded-RP as defined in section-7.1 of Embedded-RP address in IPv6
   Multicast address [RFC3956], mentions that to avoid loops and
   inconsistencies, for addresses in the range FF70::/12, the
   Embedded-RP mapping must be considered the longest possible match and
   higher priority than any other mechanism.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  This
   document also uses following terms:

   o  PIM Mode

   PIM Mode is the mode of operation a particular multicast group is
   used for.  Wherever this term in used in this document, it refers to
   either Sparse Mode or BIDIR Mode.

3.  Existing algorithm

   Existing algorithm defined in PIM-SM (Section 4.7.1 in [RFC4601])
   does not consider following constraints:

   o  It does not consider the origin of a Group-to-RP mapping and
      therefore will treat all of them equally.

   o  It does not provide the flexibility that a specific statically
      created Group-to-RP mapping can override any dynamically learned
      mappings.

   o  It does not provide the flexibility to give higher priority to a
      specific PIM mode.  For example, an entry learned for PIM-BIDIR
      mode is treated with same priority as an entry learned for PIM-SM.

Internet-Draft           PIM Group-to-RP Mapping          September 2009


4.  Assumptions

   We have made following assumptions in defining this algorithm:

   o  PIM-SM [RFC4601] and BSR [RFC5059] suggested use of a hash
      function as the last step to select a RP from multiple Group-to-RP
      mappings.  There seems to be no requirement for this function, so
      this draft assumes that the step to apply hash function can be
      removed.

   o  A static Group-to-RP mapping entry can be configured with
      override-dynamic flag.  If this flag is set, the static
      Group-to-RP mapping entry will be preferred instead of dynamically
      learned entries.

   o  Group-to-RP mappings created with the embedded RP extracted from
      Multicast Group addresses are special and always has the highest
      priority.  These mappings can not be overridden by a static Group-
      to-RP mapping with override-dynamic flag set.

   o  A Group-to-RP mapping can be learned from various mechanisms.  We
      assume that following list is in the decreasing preferences of
      these mechanism:

      *  Embedded Group-to-RP mappings

      *  Bootstrap Router Mechanism [PIM-BSR]

      *  Auto-RP [Cisco]

      *  Static configuration.

      *  Other mapping method

   o  A Group-to-RP mapping learned for PIM-BIDIR mode is preferred to
      an entry learned for PIM-SM mode.

Internet-Draft           PIM Group-to-RP Mapping          September 2009


5.  Common use cases

   o  Default static Group-to-RP mappings with dynamically learned
      entries

   Many network operators will have a dedicated infrastructure for the
   standard multicast group range (224/4) and so might be using
   statically configured Group-to-RP mappings for this range.  In this
   case, to support some specific applications, they might like to learn
   Group-to-RP mappings dynamically using either BSR or Auto-RP
   mechanism.  In this case to select Group-to-RP mappings for these
   specific applications, a longer prefix match should be given
   preference over statically configured Group-to-RP mappings.  For
   example 239.100.0.0/16 could be learned for a corporate
   communications application.  Network operators may change the Group-
   to-RP mappings for these applications more often and would need to be
   learned dynamically.

   o  Static Group-to-RP mappings with override-dynamic flag

   Many Network operators would like to statically configure one or
   multiple Group-to-RP mappings and would always want to ignore any
   dynamically learned mappings through either BSR, AutoRP or embedded
   RP for these group prefixes.  This is accomplished by providing a
   'override-dynamic' flag for Group-to-RP mapping configuration.  When
   this flag is enabled for a static Group-to-RP mapping, it will have
   the highest precedence and would always be use for the specified
   group prefix.  For example: 224.1.0.0/16 is configured with override-
   dynamic flag enabled and uses RP address RP1.  If the router learns
   the more specific group prefix 224.1.1.0/24 which uses RP2 through
   BSR, it will choose the RP1 for any group falling under 224.1.0.0/16
   range.

   o  Migration situations

   Network operators occasionally go through a migration due to an
   acquisition or a change in their network design.  In order to
   facilitate this migration there is a needs to have a deterministic
   behavior of Group-to-RP mapping selection for entries learned using
   BSR and AutoRP mechanism.  This will help in avoiding any unforeseen
   interoperability issues between different vendor's network elements.

   o  Use by management systems

   A network management system [or a stand alone box] can find out RP
   for a specific group in a specific router by running this algorithm
   on the Group-to-RP mapping table fetched using SNMP MIB objects.

6.  Proposed algorithm

   We propose following algorithm here which addresses the above
   mentioned shortcomings in the existing mechanism:

   1.   If the Multicast Group Address being looked up contains an
        embedded RP, RP address extracted from the Group address is
        selected as Group-to-RP mapping.

   2.   If the Multicast Group Address being looked up is in the SSM
        range or is configured for Dense mode, no Group-to-RP mapping is
        selected, and this algorithm terminates.  Alternatively, a RP
        with address type 'unknown' can be selected.  Please look at
        section #8 for more details on this.

   3.   From the set of all Group-to-RP mapping entries, the subset
        whose group prefix contains the multicast group that is being
        looked up, are selected.

   4.   If there are no entries available, then the Group-to-RP mapping
        is undefined.

   5.   If there are multiple entries available, a subset of those
        Group-to-RP mapping is selected that are learned using 'static'
        configuration and are configured with 'override-dynamic' flag.

        *  If there is only one entry available then that is selected as
           Group-to-RP mapping.

        *  If there are multiple entries available, we continue with the
           algorithm with this smaller set of Group-to-RP Mappings

        *  If there are no static entries with 'override-dynamic' flag
           set then we continue with the original subset of Group-to-RP
           Mappings from step 2.

   6.   A longest prefix match is performed on the subset of Group-to-RP
        Mappings.

        *  If there is only one entry available then that is selected as
           Group-to-RP mapping.

        *  If there are multiple entries available, we continue with the
           algorithm with this smaller set of Group-to-RP Mappings

   7.   From the remaining set of Group-to-RP Mappings we select the
        subset of entries based on the preference for the PIM modes
        which they are assigned.  A Group-to-RP mapping entry with PIM

Internet-Draft           PIM Group-to-RP Mapping          September 2009


        Mode 'BIDIR' will be preferred to an entry with PIM Mode
        'PIM-SM'

        *  If there is only one entry available then that is selected as
           Group-to-RP mapping.

        *  If there are multiple entries available, we continue with the
           algorithm with this smaller set of Group-to-RP Mappings

   8.   From the remaining set of Group-to-RP Mappings we select the
        subset of the entries based on the origin.  Origin preference
        will be 'bsr', 'auto-rp', 'static' and 'other'.

        *  If there is only one entry available then that is selected as
           Group-to-RP mapping.

        *  If there are multiple entries available, we continue with the
           algorithm with this smaller set of Group-to-RP Mappings

   9.   If the remaining Group-to-RP mappings were learned through BSR
        and the PIM Mode of the Group is 'PIM-SM' then the hash function
        will be used to choose the RP.  The RP with the highest
        resulting hash value will be selected.

        *  If more than one RP has the same highest hash value we
           continue with the algorithm with those Group-to-RP mappings.

        *  If the remaining Group-to-RP mappings were NOT learned from
           BSR we continue the algorithm with the next step

   10.  From the remaining set of Group-to-RP Mappings we will select
        the RP with the highest IP address.  This will serve as a final
        tiebreaker.

7.  Deprecation of MIB Objects

   Group-to-RP mapping algorithm defined in PIM-STD-MIB [RFC5060] does
   not specify the usage of 'pimGroupMappingPrecedence' and
   'pimStaticRPPrecedence' objects in 'pimGroupMappingTable' table
   clearly.  With the newly proposed algorithm in this document, these
   MIB objects would not be required.  So we propose to deprecate these
   MIB objects from PIM-STD-MIB.  Also the newly proposed algorithm in
   this document MUST be preferred over Group-to-RP mapping algorithm
   defined in either PIM-SM[RFC4601] or in PIM-STD-MIB[RFC5060].

Internet-Draft           PIM Group-to-RP Mapping          September 2009


8.  Clarification for MIB Objects

   When an Group-to-RP mapping entry is created in the
   pimGroupMappingTable in the PIM-STD MIB[RFC5060], it would be
   acceptable to have an entry with an RP with address type 'unknown'
   and a PimMode of Dense Mode or SSM.  These entries would represent
   group ranges for Dense mode or SSM.

   Also all the entries which are already included in the SSM Range
   table in the IP Mcast MIB would be copied over to
   pimGroupMappingTable.  They would have a type of configSSM and an RP
   with address type 'unknown' as described above.

   The advantage of keeping all the ranges in the table would be that
   this table will contain all the known multicast group ranges.

9.  Use of dynamic group-to-rp mapping protocols

   In practice, it is not usually necessary to run several dynamic
   Group-to-RP mapping mechanisms in one administrative domain.
   Specifically, interoperation of BSR and AutoRP is OPTIONAL and not
   recommended by this document.

   However, if a router does receive two overlapping sets of Group-to-RP
   mappings, for example from AutoRP and BSR, then some algorithm is
   needed to deterministically resolve the situation.  The algorithm in
   this document MUST be used.  This can be important at domain border
   routers, and is likely to improve stability under misconfiguration
   and when configuration is changing.

   An implementation of PIM that supports only one mechanism for
   learning Group-to-RP mappings SHOULD also use this algorithm.  The
   algorithm has been chosen so that existing standard implementations
   are already compliant.
