Abstract 
   This memo provides a generalized framework for solution standards to 
   meet the requirements presented in draft-ietf-mboned-maccnt-req-
   04.txt, "Requirements for Accounting, Authentication and 
   Authorization in Well Managed IP Multicasting Services". In this 
   framework a user sends a request for multicast data to a network 
   service provider.  The network service provider selects the 
   appropriate content provider to send the user's request.  The request 
   is sent by the network service provider to the content provider 
   transparently in a way so that the network service provider and 
   content provider do not need to know the corresponding user id for 
   the same user in the other provider's domain.  The content provider 
   then responds with an indication of "success" or "failure" to the 
   network provider and in the case of "success", the network provider 
   may delivery the requested data to the user.  The network service may 
   base its decision to deliver such data to the user based on its 
   bandwidth management policy.  The framework is designed to be 
   flexible and extendible, so it will be possible to implement 
   partially enabled versions as well as fully enabled versions of the 
   model.  Also an additional entity may provide transit of requests 
   between network service providers and content providers, either 
   through relaying or tunneling. 
                                      
 
1. Introduction 
    
1.1 Purpose and Background 
    
   IP multicasting is designed to serve cases where a single source of 
   data content is to be concurrently streamed to multiple recipients.  
   In these types of cases, multicasting provides resource efficiencies

   (both for the overall network and the content server) relative to 
   unicasting.  These efficiencies are possible because of the avoidance 
   of unnecessary duplication of streams, video/audio processing, etc. 
   Multicasting also provides resource efficiencies relative to IP 
   broadcasting in that content data is only delivered to end hosts 
   which request it.   
 
   There are many real-life situations where IP multicasting is selected 
   as the technology used for concurrent content delivery of identical 
   content data to multiple end-hosts.   "Requirements for Accounting, 
   Authentication and Authorization in Well Managed IP Multicasting 
   Services", (draft-ietf-mboned-maccnt-req-04.txt, hereafter MACCNT-
   REQ-draft) describes the requirements in CDN services using IP 
   multicast[1]. "Issues Related to Receiver Access Control in the 
   Current Multicast Protocols" (draft-ietf-mboned-rac-issues-03.txt, 
   hereafter RAC-ISSUES-draft) discusses the requirements and existing 
   support for large-scale, multi-entity content delivery services[2].  
   The requirements are derived from: 
        - need for user tracking and billing capabilities 
        - need for network access control and/or content access control 
   to satisfy the requirements of the CP 
        - methods for sharing information between the network service 
   provider and content provider to make it possible to fulfill the 
   above two requirements. 
    
   Detailed requirements are presented in MACCNT-REQ-draft.   These 
   requirements include mechanisms for recording end-user requests and 
   provider responses for content-delivery, sharing user information 
   (possibly anonymously depending on the trust model) between content 
   provider and network service provider, and protecting resources 
   through the prevention of network and content access by unauthorized 
   users, as well as other AAA related requirements. 
     
   The purpose of this memo is to provide a generalized framework for  
   solution standards to meet these requirements. This framework is to 
   provide a basis for defining protocols, but definition of the actual 
   protocols is outside of the scope of this memo.

3. Framework and Roles of Entities 
 
    
3.1 Framework for multicast AAA allowing bandwidth Management   
 
   A general high-level framework can be represented as follows.

                v                | 
            +------------------------------+ 
            |    CP                        | 
            |                              | 
            +------------------------------+ 
 
   For the sake of simplicity, the above diagram portrays a case where 
   there is a single NSP entity and a single CP entity.  Under the 
   framework it is possible for there to be multiple CPs connected to 
   the same NSP. It is also possible for the same CP to be connected to 
   multiple NSP networks (e.g. network selection).  In other words the 
   relationship of NSP:CP can be described as  1:1, 1:N or M:N.  
   Furthermore it is possible that the NSP and CP could be the same 
   entity.   
 
   Description of Roles: 
    
   The user selects a CP and a NSP when the user requests content. The 
   NSP may be automatically selected by a user terminal: e.g. a fixed 
   line NSP for STB or a mobile NSP for mobile phone. 
    
   The CP is responsible for Authentication and Authorization of users' 
   access to content that the CP manages. The CP hopes to collect 
   accounting information related to the access of their content. The CP 
   may choose to authenticate and authorize NSPs which are eligible to 
   provide users access to its contents.  When the CP cannot or decides 
   not to provide content to be multicast to users, the CP is 
   responsible for notifying the NSP of the reason. 
 
   The NSP is responsible for managing its network resources.  The NSP 
   may perform admission control to protect bandwidth resource and needs

   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting       June 2006 
    
    
   authorized information regarding user access for bandwidth 
   management. 
   It is also responsible for confirming (authentication by proxy) with 
   the CP whether the user is eligible to receive content. When the NSP 
   cannot or decides not to multicast to users, the NSP is responsible 
   for notifying the users of the reason. 
   In addition to the three basic entities of user, NSP and CP, this AAA 
   framework for multicasting supports transit provision which transfers 
   multicast streams from the CP to the NSP.  
 
3.2 Multiple User IDs 
    
   Users may be assigned separate user IDs for each subscription for 
   various NSPs and CPs.  When the user wants to access content or 
   otherwise use the network, the user registers the corresponding user 
   ID with a request for content, etc: web authentication is one 
   possible method. 
    
   Terminal portability can be realized if the NSP authenticates a user 
   using a user ID. This allows the user to access the content from 
   various network access points. 
    
   Each CP may identify users by the user IDs it has issued to them. 
    
   The NSP and CP do not need to know the corresponding user id for the 
   same user in the other provider's domain, and it is not necessary 
   that there is a one to one relationship.  It is quite possible for 
   one person to hold multiple user ids for the same provider. 
    
3.3 Accounting 
    
   The NSP should not manage multicast states on a subnet basis, but on 
   a user basis because the NSP needs to notify start and stop times for 
   accounting purposes. This means that the NSP sends an indication for 
   Join and Leave on a user basis. 
    
   The NSP should log both user and host information for each join and 
   leave, indicating the corresponding multicast source for each action.  
   It is important that such log use a standard format so that it can be 
   shared with the CP.  Intermittent logs between the join and leave 
   also could serve useful in billing discrepancies, and disconnects 
   without leaves.  Ideally a solution would also provide standard ways 
   for the NSP to share logged information with the CP.  When shared it 
   is important that the CP be able to match the user to the user within 
   its domain. 
 
3.4 Access Control and CP selection by NSP 
    
   When a NSP receives an access request from a user, it is necessary 
   for the NSP to determine to which CP the request is directed. It is 
    
    
    
   Satou, Ohta, Hayashi, He                                   [Page 6] 
    
   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting       June 2006 
    
    
   necessary for the NSP to ensure that it is not spoofed by an 
   inappropriate CP. 
 
 
3.5 Network Resource Management by NSP 
 
   After authorizing a user request, the NSP may conduct admission 
   control based on its bandwidth management policy. For example, if the 
   NSP manages the shared bandwidth of access lines, the NSP might 
   calculate available bandwidth and necessary bandwidth, and based on 
   these calculations determine to accept or reject a user request. 
    
    
3.6 Access Control and Distinguishing of Users by CP 
    
   The user ID and authentication information are forwarded 
   transparently by the NSP so that the CP can distinguish the user, as 
   well as authenticate and authorize the request. 
    
3.7 Caching of AAA results 
    
   An NSP should be able to cache AAA results based an understanding 
   between the NSP and a CP.  The AAA cache would store information 
   about permissions of a specific user to receive multicast data from 
   specified channel(s) up to specified expiration date(s) and time(s).   
   If such caching is implemented, a method must exist for the CP to 
   communicate this permission information to the NSP.  The NSP refers 
   to the AAA cache and if the cache indicates that the user has 
   permission to receive multicast data from a specific channel at that 
   time, the NSP may forward the data without querying the CP.   
    
   It should be possible for a CP to send a directive to the NSP to 
   refresh or change permissions for a user for specific channel(s).   
    
   It is necessary for the NSP to requery the CP for authorization 
   should a user be receiving content when the permission expires.   
 
   It would be desirable to have a mechanism by which CPs could 
   proactively push permission information to the cache even when not 
   specifically queried by the NSP. 
     
    
4. Network Connection Model and Functional Components 
    
   Section 3.1 introduces the high-level AAA framework for multicasting.  
   This section provides more detail on the network connection model and 
   constituent functional components.  
 
4.1 Basic Connection Model 
    
    
    
    
   Satou, Ohta, Hayashi, He                                   [Page 7] 
    
   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting       June 2006 
    
    
                  +-------------+  
                  |     user    |  
                  |             |  
                  +-------------+  
                          ^ Access & Resource 
                          | Request 
                          v 
                  +-------------+  
                  |     NSP     |  
                  |             |  
                  +-------------+  
                          ^ Access     
                          | Request    
                          v            
                  +-------------+   
                  |     CP      |   
                  |             |   
                  +-------------+   
    
   First a user desiring authorization sends an Access request to an NSP 
   which then forwards it on to the appropriate CP for Authentication 
   and Authorization. The CP responds with either "success" or 
   "failure".  If "success", the NSP may forward a success response 
   and stream multicast data to the user. 
    
   In this model the user selects the NSP to which to send its content 
   request.  Based on this request the NSP selects an appropriate CP to 
   which it forwards the request. The CP responds to the NSP's request:  
   it may not respond to another NSP in regards to the request. 
    
   In this model, as described in section 3.1, the relationship between 
   NSP and CP can be 1:1, 1:N or M:N.  Users may connect to multiple 
   networks, and networks have multiple users.

4.2 Transit Provision 
    
   The diagram below shows that a Transit Provider(hereafter, TP)  may 
   relay requests between NSPs and CPs.   
 
                  +-------------+  
                  |     user    |  
                  |             |

                          | Request 
                          v 
                  +-------------+  
                  |     NSP     |  
                  |             |  
                  +-------------+  
                          ^ Access & Resource 
                          | Request 
                          v 
                  +-------------+  
                  |     TP      |  
                  |             |  
                  +-------------+ 
                          ^ Access     
                          | Request    
                          v            
                  +-------------+   
                  |     CP      |   
                  |             |   
                  +-------------+   
    
   For the sake of simplification the above diagram shows a 1-1 
   relationship between an NSP and a TP.  However it is also possible 
   for a single NSP to connect to multiple TPs, and a single TP to 
   multiple NSPs.   
    
   A single TP may connect to one or more CPs. Similarly just as a 
   single CP may connect to multiple NSPs (as described in the general 
   high-level framework, section 3.1), a single CP may connect to one or 
   more TPs.   
     
   A solution will include a mechanism through which the NSPs know which 
   TP(s) are to be used to communicate with which CP(s), and CPs know 
   which TP(s) to use for which NSP(s).  When a TP receives an access or 
   resource request from an NSP or CP, it must relay the request to the 
   correct CP or NSP, respectively.  Minimally, this means that it must 
   reconstruct the request with translated address information.  In this 
   model therefore a TP must understand the format and meaning of the 
   requests. 
    
    
    
    
   Satou, Ohta, Hayashi, He                                   [Page 9] 
    
   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting       June 2006 
    
    
   There may be multiple TPs between a NSP and CP so that a TP is 
   actually receiving from and/or sending requests to another TP and not 
   directly from/to a NSP or CP. 
    
4.3 Transit with Tunnels 
    
   In addition to the above model of request relaying, a TP may 
   communicate requests through tunneling based on the contract between 
   the TP and the NSP and/or between the TP and the CP.  So in this case 
   the TP will not directly need to process the contents of the access 
   and resource request (such as, header information), but instead pass 
   the request directly to the correct NSP or CP, using a separate 
   protocol to wrap the original requests. 
    
   Below is a diagram, representing how a TP can provider tunneling 
   between NSP(s) and CP(s).

   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting       June 2006 
    
    
4.4 Constituent Logical Functional Components of the fully enabled AAA 
Framework 
    
   Section 3.1 introduces the high-level AAA framework for multicasting.  
   Below is a diagram of a fully enabled multicasting network with AAA, 
   including the logical components within the various entities. 
    
    
            +-------------------------------+

            |+--------------+ RR +---------+|    (RR= resource request) 
            +-------------------------------+ 
                          ^ 
                          | Access request 
                          v 
            +------------------------------+ 
            |             CP               | 
            |                              | 
            |         +---------+          | 
            |         |   AAA   |          | 
            |         +---------+          | 
            +------------------------------+ 
    
   In the fully enabled model the NSP provides proxying of 
   authentication and authorization between the NSP and CP, as well as 
   user-based accounting.  The AAA proxy server of the NSP communicates 
   with the CP's AAA server.  Although not show in the above diagram for 
   the sake of simplicity, in addition to direct proxying between a NSP 
   and CP, this proxying may be done through a TP.  This means that the 
   transit provider too is able to support AAA proxying.  
    
   In the fully enabled model the NSP also includes a component that 
   provides network resource management (e.g. QoS management), as 
   described in section 3.4, "Network Resource Management by NSP".  When 
   a transit provider is used it may also provide Network Resource 
   management of its own resources.   
    
4.5 Modularity of the framework

   In the interest of flexibility, this framework is modular so that it 
   is possible that partially enabled versions of the models are 
   supported.  A AAA-enabled version provides AAA functionality without 
   Network Resource management.  A Network-Resource-Management-enabled 
   (QoS-enabled) version provides Network Resource management without 
   AAA functionality.  Similarly, the possibility of one or more layers 
   of transit provision between an NSP and CP is in the interest of 
   modularity and extendibility. 
    
    
5. IANA considerations 
    
   This memo does not raise any IANA consideration issues. 
    
    
6. Security considerations 
    
   Refer to section 3.3.  Also the user information related to 
   authentication with the CP should be protected in some way.  
   Otherwise, this memo does not raise any new security issues which are 
   not already existing in the original protocols.  Enhancement of 
   multicast access control capabilities may enhance security 
   performance. 
    
    
7. Conclusion 
    
   This memo provides a generalized framework for solution standards to 
   meet the requirements presented in MACCNT-REQ-draft.  Further work 
   should be done to break down the content provider and network service 
   provider entities into their functional objects such as edge devices, 
   AAA servers, etc.
