1.  Introduction

   [RFC8345] defines an abstract YANG data model for network/service
   topologies and inventories.  Service topology in [RFC8345] includes
   the a virtual topology for a service layer above the L1, L2, and L3
   layers.  This virtual topology has the generic topology elements of
   node,link, and terminating point.  One typical example of a service
   topology is described in figure 3 of [RFC8345],two VPN service
   topologies instantiated over a common L3 topology.  Each VPN service
   topology is mapped onto a subset of nodes from the common L3
   topology.

   In [RFC8299], the 3 types of VPN service topologies proposed for
   L3VPN service data model are any to any, hub and spoke, hub and spoke
   disjoint.  These VPN topology types can be used to describe how VPN
   sites are communicating with each other.

   This document defines a YANG Model for VPN Service Performance
   Monitoring that can be used to monitor and manage network Performance

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  In this
   document, these words will appear with that interpretation only when
   in ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying [RFC2119] significance.

   The following notations are used within the data tree and carry the
   meaning as below.

   Each node is printed as:

    <status> <flags> <name> <opts> <type>

    <status> is one of:
         +  for current

    <flags> is one of:

        rw for configuration data
        ro for non-configuration data
        -x for rpcs
        -n for notifications
        -w for writable

    <name> is the name of the node

    If the node is augmented into the tree from another module, its name
    is printed as <prefix>:<name>.

    <opts> is one of:

         ?  for an optional leaf or choice
         !  for a presence container
         *  for a leaf-list or list
         [<keys>] for a list's keys
         (choice)/:(case) Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes,
         and case nodes are also marked with a colon (":")
         <type> is the name of the type for leafs and leaf-lists

3.  VPN Service Topology Overview

   As specified in [RFC8345], the data model defined in [RFC8345] can
   describe vertical layering relationships between networks that can be
   augmented to cover network/service topologies.  The following figure
   describes relationships between L3VPN Service Topo and Underlying
   network:

                  VPN-1           VPN-2
                     /               \
      L3VPN-Service-topology 1  L3VPN-Service-topology-2
            /     |      \            /     |      \
       Site-1A site-1B site1-C    site-2A Site-2B Site-2C    Top-Down
         |          |       |       |         |     |      Service Topo
     ====|==========|=======|=======|=========|=====|===================

      Bottoms-up |  |         \ /           /       |
      Network    |  |         /\           /        |
      topology   |  |       /    \        |         |
                 |  |      |       |      |         |
             node1 node2 node3   node4   node5    node6
               PE   PE    PE       PE      PE       PE
               |     |     |        |       |        |
              CE    CE     CE      CE      CE       CE

     layering relationships between L3VPN Service Topo and Underlying
                                  network

   As shown in figure 1, the Site-1,A,B,C are mapped to node 1,2,3 while
   Site-2 A,B,C are mapped to node 4,5,6 in the underlying physical
   network.  In this figure, an L3SM has two VPN services topologies
   with each built on top of one common underlying physical network.

      VPN-svc 1: supporting hub-spoke communication for Customer 1 with
      connecting the customers access at 3 sites

      VPN-svc 2: supporting hub-spoke disjoint communication for
      Customer 2 with connecting the customers access at 3 sites

   L3VPN service topology 1 is hub and spoke topology while L3VPN
   service topology 2 is hub and spoke disjoint topology.  In L3VPN
   service topology1, Site-1 A plays the role of hub while Site-2 B and
   C plays the role of spoke.  In L3VPN service topoogy2, Site-2 A and B
   play the role of hub while Site-2 C plays the role of spoke.

4.  VPN service assurance model

   This module describes VPN Service assurance that can be used to
   monitor and manage network Performance between VPN sites and it is a
   augmentation to the I2RS network topology YANG data model.  The
   performance monitoring data is augmented to service topology.

   +------------+          +---------------------+
   |I2RS Network|          |    VPN Service      |
   |Topo Model  |<---------|Peformance Monitoring|
   +------------+ augments |        Model        |
                           +---------------------+

5.  Model Usage Guideline

   An SP must be able to manage the capabilities and characteristics of
   their VPN services when VPN sites are setup to communicate with each
   other.  VPN service topology such as hub and spoke describes how
   these VPN sites are communicating with each other.

5.1.  Performance Monitoring Data Source

   As described in section 2, once the mapping between VPN Service
   topology and underlying physical network has been setup, the
   performance monitoring data per link in the underlying network can be
   collected using network performance measurement method such as MPLS
   Loss and Delay Measurement [RFC6374] and The performance monitoring
   information reflecting the quality of the VPN service such as end to
   end network performance data between VPN sites can be aggregated or
   calculated using PCEP solution [RFC5440] or LMAP solution [RFC8194]
   and fed into data source such as the management system or network
   devices.  The measurement interval and report interval associated
   with these performance data usually depends on configuration
   parameters.

5.2.  Retrieval via I2RS Pub/Sub

   For some applications such as service-assurance applications, which
   must maintain a continuous view of operational data and state, they
   can use subscription model [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] to subscribe
   to their interested VPN service performance data in the data source.
   And then the data source can use VPN service assurance model and push
   model [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] to publish specific telemetry data
   to target recipients.

5.3.  On demand Retrieval via RPC model

   To obtain a snapshot of a large amount of performance data from the
   network element, service-assurance applications can also use polling
   based solution such as RPC model to fetch performance data on demand.

6.  Design of the Data Model

   This document defines the YANG module "ietf-vpn-svc-pm", which has
   the following structure

6.1.  Network Level

   module: ietf-vpn-svc-pm
     augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types:
       +--rw svc-topo-type?   identityref
     augment /nw:networks/nw:network:
       +--rw svc-topo-attributes
          +--rw vpn-topo?   identityref

                   Network Level View of the hierarchies

   The VPN service performance monitoring model defines only the
   following minimal set of Network level service topology attributes:

   o  svc-topo-type: Indicate the network type is service topology type
      such as L3VPN service topology, L2VPN service topology.

   o  vpn-topo: The type of VPN service topology, Ourproposed model
      supports any-to-any, Hub and Spoke (where Hubs can exchange
      traffic), and "Hub and Spoke disjoint" (where Hubs cannot exchange
      traffic).

6.2.  Node Level

   augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node:
       +--rw node-attributes
          +--rw node-type?   identityref
          +--rw site-id?     string
          +--rw site-role?   Identityref

                    Node Level View of the hierarchies

   The VPN service performance monitoring model defines only the
   following minimal set of Node level service topology attributes and
   constraints:

   o  Node-type (Attribute): Indicate the type of the node, such as PE
      or ASBR.

   o  Site-id (Constraint): Uniquely identifies the site within the
      overall network infrastructure.

   o  Site-role (Constraint):Defines the role of the site in a
      particular VPN topology.

6.3.  Link and Termination Point Level

     augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link:
       +--ro svc-telemetry-attributes
          +--ro loss-statistics
          |  +--ro direction                 identityref
          |  +--ro packet-loss-count?          uint32
          |  +--ro loss-ratio?                 percentage
          |  +--ro packet-reorder-count?       uint32
          |  +--ro packets-out-of-seq-count?   uint32

          |  +--ro average-delay-value?   uint32
          +--ro jitter-statistics
             +--ro direction?             identityref
             +--ro min-jitter-value?       uint32
             +--ro max-jitter-value?       uint32
             +--ro average-jitter-value?   uint32

         Link and Termination point Level View of the hierarchies

   The VPN service performance monitoring model defines only the
   following minimal set of Link level service topology attributes:

      Loss Statistics: A set of loss statistics attributes that are used
      to measure end to end loss between VPN sites.

      Delay Statistics: A set of delay statistics attributes that are
      used to measure end to end latency between VPN sites.

      Jitter Statistics: A set of jitter statistics attributes that are
      used to measure end to end jitter between VPN sites.

10.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document MAY be accessed via the
   RESTCONF protocol [RFC8040] or NETCONF protocol ([RFC6241]).  The
   lowest RESTCONF or NETCONF layer requires that the transport-layer
   protocol provides both data integrity and confidentiality, see
   Section 2 in [RFC8040] and [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is
   the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH)[RFC6242] . The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /ni:network-instances/ni:network-instance/svc-topo:svc-telemetry-
      attributes
