Abstract

   This document defines a set of structured requirements whereby a
   presence information subscriber may select specific information to be
   received in the presence infomation notification sent by the
   notifier. The purpose is to limit the content and frequency of
   notifications so that only essential information on a need basis is
   delivered by the server.

Internet-Draft      Presence Filtering Requirements             May 2003


1. Introduction

   SIP event notification is described in [6]. It defines a general
   framework for subscriptions and notifications for SIP event packages.
   Concrete applications of the general event framework to a specific
   group of events are described in [5] (user presence) and [7] (watcher
   information).

   The presence information refers to a set of presence attributes
   describing the availability and willingness of the user (presentity)
   for communication. The user makes his presence information available
   for other users (watchers).

   As the inherent usage of event packages grows, the client needs some
   mechanisms for controlling the event notifications at the source.
   Evidence of this need is found in [4].

   The Internet Draft describing the Presence event package [5] mentions
   the possibility for a filtering. Accordingly, the SUBSCRIBE request
   may contain a body for filtering the presence information
   subscription. However, the definition of the filtering has been left
   out of the scope of the Internet Draft. As an example, the body of
   the SUBSCRIBE request may include a restriction on the set of data
   returned in NOTIFY requests.

   These mechanisms are expected to be particularly valuable to users of
   wireless devices. The characteristics of these devices typically
   include low bandwidth, low data processing capabilities, small
   display and limited battery power. Such devices can benefit from the
   ability to filter the amount of information generated at the source
   of the event notification.

   However, it is expected that the control mechanisms for event
   notifications add value for all users irrespectively of their device
   or network access characteristics.

   Section 3 and Section 4 of this draft propose a set of requirements
   whereby a client may specify which notifications it is interested in.
   That is, a means to specify filtering rules to be executed by the
   server. Section 6 provides a few example applications of notification
   filtering.

2. Conventions

   In this document, the key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED',
   'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY',
   and 'OPTIONAL' are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]
   and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3. Requirements for Specification of Filters

   The following requirements relate to the creation of filters (rules).

3.1 Common Syntax

   A common set of constructs MUST be defined for the creation of rules.
   There MUST be a common set of operations that follow a common syntax.
   The user MUST be possible to define different rules for different
   purposes using a common filtering mechanism.

3.2 Package Identification

   A means is REQUIRED whereby the user may specify the package the
   rules apply to.

3.3 Target URI

   It MUST be possible for the watcher to indicate the target presentity
   or presentity list to which a certain filter criteria is applied.

   It MUST be possible to support filtering also in presence list
   subscriptions.

   Is MUST be possible to specify different filter criteria for
   individual presentities than the other presence list members in a
   presence list subscription case.

3.4 Notification Triggering

   This chapter presents requirements for specifying the desired
   conditions for when notifications are to be sent to the client.

   The scope of the 'when' part is to allow a possibility for the user
   to specify such rules for the notification triggering where the
   criteria is based on the presence information, e.g., the value of the
   status element.

   The notification triggering criteria would override the default
   trigger conditions of the server/service as defined in the package
   when they are within the server's local policy constraints.

   It MUST be possible to specify logical expressions based on the value
   of elements defined in the package for the purpose of when to send
   notifications. This covers expressions (tests) related to the change
   of an element's value, and reaching a certain value of an element.

   It MUST be possible to construct expressions that combine multiple

   tests.

3.5 Notification Content Limiting

   This chapter presents requirements for specifying the content to be
   sent in the notifications.

   It MUST be possible for the watcher to specify the presence
   information elements [2] (XML elements and/or attributes) to be
   delivered in the notification. The specified elements MUST be able to
   cover also extensions to PIDF formated presence information, see for
   example [3].

   E.g. the following two cases must be possible:

   o  The watcher MUST be able to define a criteria which allows the
      complete tuple and all information within a tuple to be
      transmitted.

   o  The watcher MUST be able to define a criteria which result
      notifies to contain values only for defined attributes.


   It MUST be possible to specify logical expressions based on the value
   of elements defined in the package for the purpose of determining
   what to send in the notification. The existence of an element SHOULD
   be considered as a criterion.

   It MUST be possible to construct expressions that combine multiple
   tests.

4. Requirements for Uploading Rules (Operational Rules)

   It MUST be possible for the watcher to upload the rules to the server
   (notifier) and know the status - accepted or rejected.

4.1 SUBSCRIBE Method

   Placing filtering rules in the body of the subscription MUST be
   supported. Other means of delivering the filtering rules to the event
   server MAY be supported. E.g. it should be possible for the rules to
   be (permanently) stored in the server, as in a presence list case.

4.1.1 Retention of Filter Settings

   The server MUST retain the uploaded filter setting for the duration
   of the subscription.

4.1.2 Changing Filter Settings

   It MUST be possible to change the filter settings during a
   subscription.

   It MUST be possible for the watcher to reset the filter settings to
   the service (server) defined default.

4.2 Server does not Support Filters

   If the server does not support filters (the content type) then it
   MUST be able to indicate so in a response.

4.3 Server does not Support Filter Settings

   It MUST be possible for the server to explicitly indicate that it
   does not support or understand the filter settings. This indication
   MAY include a reason about the refusal of the filter settings.

4.4 Server can no Longer Support Filter Settings

   The server MUST be able to terminate the subscription if the active
   filter is no longer applicable due to a policy in the server.

5. Security Considerations

   Further security requirements over [5] have not yet been identified.

6. Example Applications for Notification Filtering

   1.  A watcher wishes to get to know presentity's availability and
       willingness for messaging (e.g. IM and MMS).

   2.  A watcher is interested in getting information about the
       communication means and contact addresses the presentity is
       currently available for communication.

   3.  A watcher requires a notification if the state of a buddy has
       changed to 'open'.

   4.  A Subscriber only wants to be notified when the presentity's
       location is Dallas or Fort Worth. The notification should include
       the vehicle license, driver name, and city.

   5.  A Basic location tracking service requires notification when the
       presentity's cell id changes. The notification should include the
       cell id.
