Abstract
   This document provides an overview by means of signalling flows of
   the methods by which 3GPP wishes to uses SIP for the specification
   of the IP Multimedia CN subsystem for the purposes of establishing
   sessions between user equipment.

Introduction
   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is described in
   draft-3GPP-collaboration-00.txt.
   The IP Multimedia CN Subsystem provides session control capabilities
   to user equipment accessing the system using the General Packet
   Radio Service, which supports the use of IP and applications that
   can use IP.
   The IP Multimedia CN subsystem will be defined in a number of 3GPP
   documents. Documents currently under development include:
   TS 22.228: "3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical
   Specification Group Services and System Aspects; Service
   requirements for the IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (Stage
   1)".
               r                d
   TS 23.228: "3                    G                   e                    neration Partnership Project; Technical
   Specification Group Services and System Aspects; IP Multimedia (IM)
   Subsystem - Stage 2".
   TS 24.228: "3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical
   Specification Group Core Network; Signalling flows for the IP
   multimedia call control based on SIP and SDP".
   TS 24.229: "3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical
   Specification Group Core Network; IP Multimedia Call Control
   Protocol based on SIP and SDP".
   TS 23.218: "3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical
   Specification Group Core Network; IP Multimedia (IM) Session
   Handling; IP Multimedia (IM) call model".
   and these may be found as described in draft-3GPP-collaboration-
   00.txt
   This document describes how 3GPP intend to apply SIP to the
   establishment of sessions between user equipment on the IM CN
   subsystem by means of diagrams showing the flow and contents of
   signalling information.
Security Considerations
   None.
