         Extra Extended DNS Error codes for DNSSEC status bogus
              draft-carpay-extra-ede-codes-dnssec-bogus-00

Abstract

   While implementing Extended DNS Errors (RFC8914) in our DNSSEC
   validating resolver software Unbound, we encountered this specific
   situations regarding the DNSSEC bogus status where no Extended DNS
   Error were yet defined.  This draft serves as a reference for code
   points requests.

1.  Introduction

   While implementing Extended DNS Errors ([RFC8914]) in our DNSSEC
   validating resolver software Unbound ([UNBOUNDPR]), we encountered
   this specific situations regarding the DNSSEC bogus status where no
   Extended DNS Error were yet defined.

1.1.  Extended DNS Error Code 26 - Signature Wrong Size

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but the
   signature is either smaller or larger than expected for the specified
   algorithm.

1.2.  Extended DNS Error Code 27 - Malformed Signer Name

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but the Signer's
   Name Field in the signature contains a malformed signer (d)name.

1.3.  Extended DNS Error Code 28 - Signer Name Out of zone

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but the Signer's
   Name Field in the signature does not contain the zone name of the
   covered RRset.

1.4.  Extended DNS Error Code 29 - Signature Label Count Wrong

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but the number
   of labels in the Signature Labels Field is incorrect.

1.5.  Extended DNS Error Code 30 - DNSSEC Insufficient NSEC Proof

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but the signed
   response does not have valid NSEC proof.

1.6.  Extended DNS Error Code 31 - DNSSEC Unknown Protocol

   The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but found a
   value not equal to 3 in the DNSKEY protocol number field as specified
   by RFC4034#section-2.1.2.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This draft requests the assignment of a new EDE code values for the
   specified EDE codes.

3.  Security Considerations

   As this draft only seeks to add code points to the EDE registry, the
   security considerations as the same as in [RFC8914].
