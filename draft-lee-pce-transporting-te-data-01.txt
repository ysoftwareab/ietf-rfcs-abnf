          PCE in Support of Transporting Traffic Engineering Data



                 draft-lee-pce-transporting-te-data-01.txt


Abstract

   In order to compute and provide optimal paths, Path Computation
   Elements (PCEs) require an accurate and timely Traffic Engineering
   Database (TED). Traditionally this TED has been obtained from a link
   state routing protocol supporting traffic engineering extensions.
   This document discusses possible alternatives and enhancements to
   the existing approach to TED creation. This document gives
   architectural alternatives for these alternatives and their
   potential impacts on network nodes, routing protocols, and PCEP.

1. Introduction

   In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS), a Traffic Engineering Database (TED) is used in computing
   paths for connection oriented packet services and for circuits. The
   TED contains all relevant information that a Path Computation

   Element (PCE) needs to perform its computations. It is important
   that the TED should be complete and accurate anytime so that the PCE
   can perform path computations.

   In MPLS and GMPLS networks, Interior Gateway routing Protocols
   (IGPs) have been used to create and maintain a copy of the TED at
   each node. One of the benefits of the PCE architecture [RFC4655] is
   the use of computationally more sophisticated path computation
   algorithms and the realization that these may need enhanced
   processing power not necessarily available at each node
   participating in an IGP.

   Section 4.3 of [RFC4655] describes the potential load of the TED on
   a network node and proposes an architecture where the TED is
   maintained by the PCE rather than the network nodes. However it did
   not describe how a PCE would obtain the information needed to
   populate its TED. PCE may construct its TED by participating in the
   IGP ([RFC3630] and [RFC5305] for MPLS-TE; [RFC4203] and [RFC5307]
   for GMPLS). An alternative is offered by BGP-LS [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-
   distribution].

   In this document we propose approaches for creating and maintaining
   the TED directly on a PCE as an alternative to IGPs and BGP
   transport and investigate on the impact from the PCE, routing
   protocol, and node perspective.

   There are two main applicability of this alternative proposed by
   this draft:



   o  Where there is no IGP-TE or BGP-LS running at the PCE to learn
      TED.

   o  Where there is IGP-TE or BGP-LS running but with a need for a
      faster TED population and convergence at the PCE.

      *  A PCE may receive partial information (say basic TE) from IGP-
         TE and other information (optical and impairment) from PCEP.

      *  A PCE may receive full information from both IGP-TE and PCEP.

   A PCC may further choose to send only local TE information or both
   local and remote learned TED information. How a PCE manages the TED

   information is implementation specific and thus out of scope of this
   document. PCEP extensions to support this idea is pursued in a
   separate draft [PCEP-TE].


   New application areas for GMPLS and PCE in optical transport
   networks include Wavelength Switched Optical Networking (WSON) and
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN). WSON scenarios can be divided into
   routing wavelength assignment (RWA) problems where a PCE requires
   detailed information about switching node asymmetries and wavelength
   constraints as well as detailed up to date information on wavelength
   usage per link [WSON-Frame]. As more data is anticipated to be made
   available to PCE with addition of OTN [Reference] and Flex-grid
   [Reference] and possible with some optical impairment data [WSON-
   IMP-Info] even with the minimum set specified in [G.680], the total
   amount of data requires significantly more information to be held in
   the TED than is required for other traffic engineered networks.
   Related to this issue published by [HWANG] indicated that long
   convergence time and large number of LSAs flooded in the network
   might cause scalability problems in OSPF-TE and impose limitations
   on OSPF-TE applications.

   In some circumstances such additional information could "bog down"
   the routing protocols on the nodes from a data processing, a
   storage, or communications perspective. In environments where PCEs
   are external to the nodes running the routing protocol, and where
   the information in the TED is not used by the switching nodes it
   makes sense to investigate alternative methods to create and
   maintain the TED at its place of use, i.e., the PCE.

   Recent development of a stateful PCE Model [PCE-Initiated] changes
   the PCE operation from path computation alone to include the support
   of PCE-initiated LSPs. With a stateful PCE model, it is also noted
   that LSP-DB is maintained by the PCE. For LSP state synchronization
   of stateful PCEs in GMPLS networks, the LSP attributes, such as its
   bandwidth, associated route as well as protection information etc,
   should be updated by PCCs to PCE LSP database (LSP-DB) [S-PCE-GMPLS].
   To support all these recent changes in a stateful PCE model, a
   direct PCE interface to each PCC has to be supported. Relevant TED
   information can also be transported from each node to PCE using this
   PCC-PCE interface. Any resource changes in the node and links can
   also be quickly updated to PCE using this interface. Convergence
   time of IGP in GMPLS networks may not be quick enough to support on-
   line dynamic connectivity required for some applications.

   This draft does not advocate that the alternative methods specified
   in this draft should completely replace the IGP-TE as the method of
   creating the TED. The split between the data to be distributed via
   an IGP and the information conveyed via one of the alternatives in
   this document depends on the nature of the network situation. One
   could potentially choose to have some traffic engineering
   information distributed via an IGP while other more specialized
   traffic information is only conveyed to the PCEs via an alternative
   interface discussed here. In addition, the methods specified in this
   draft is only relevant to a set of architecture options where
   routing decisions are wholly or partially made in the PCE.

   However, the networks that do not support IGP-TE/BGP-LS, the method
   proposed by this draft may be very relevant.

1.1. TED Creation and Maintenance via IGP-TEs

   Routing protocols, in particular, IGP-TEs such as Open Shortest Path
   First (OSPF) and Intermediate system to intermediate system (IS-IS),
   take on a number of roles with respect to the control and data
   planes for IP, MPLS, and GMPLS.  In all three technology families
   the underlying control plane communications technology is IP and
   hence all utilize the IGPs ability to control and run the IP data
   plane.

   For the IP layer, the IGP directly establishes data plane
   connectivity. In the MPLS and GMPLS cases separate signaling
   protocols are used to directly control the data plane connectivity
   and in these cases the prime purpose of the routing protocol is to
   furnish network topology and resource status information used by
   path computation algorithms on the nodes or PCEs. Hence in the IP
   case the IGP is directly service impacting, while in the MPLS/GMPLS
   case it is only indirectly service impacting.

   The IP layer information and the MPLS/GMPLS data plane layer
   information may be kept by the IGPs in two different information
   stores. These are referred to as databases but are not necessarily
   relational databases.  In OSPF the information directly related to
   IP connectivity (and hence the control communications plane for all
   three technologies) and non-IP advertisements are kept in the link
   state database (LSDB), while information related to traffic
   engineering used by MPLS and GMPLS is kept in a (conceptually)
   separate TED which can be considered a subset of the LSDB. This TED
   information is distributed in a different data structure (Opaque LSA
   [RFC5250]). When we talk about adding additional technology-specific
   GMPLS information used for path computation we are only talking
   about adding to the TED and not the IP portion of the LSDB.

   There are three main functions performed by an IGP: (a) hello
   protocol, (b) database synchronization (with neighbors), (c)
   database updates.

   Data Plane        |  Hello Protocol             |  Database Sync

                     | Plane Adjacencies           |
   --------------------------------------------------------------
   MPLS              | Establish Control & Data    | LSDB & TED
                     | Plane Adjacencies           |

   --------------------------------------------------------------

       Table 1 Main Functions of an IGP for various technologies

   The procedures for maintaining LSDBs and TEDs in IGP-TEs have been
   very successful and well proven over time.  These consist of:

     1. Ageing the individual pieces of information in the TED
        (including discarding them when the information gets too old)
        to remove stale information from the TED.

     2. Originator of the information being required to periodically
        resend TED information to prevent it from being discarded.

     3. Originator of the information sending updates of information as
        needed, but subject to limits on how many/often these can be
        sent to keep the TED up-to-date, but to avoid swamping the
        network.

     4. Reliable method for getting this information to other peers
        (flooding) to ensure that the information is delivered to all
        participants.

     5. An efficient database synchronization mechanism for sharing
        info with a newly established peer.

2. Alternative TED Creation & Maintenance for a PCE

   Given that nodes, by their position and role in the network, have
   accurate traffic engineering information concerning their local link
   ends and switching properties, it seems natural that, if other nodes
   in the network cannot make use of this information or do not want

Internet-Draft            PCE TED transport                   July 2014


   it, the information should only be conveyed to interested PCEs. In
   such case the flooding of TE information to all nodes may not be
   very efficient in terms of memory, CPU, bandwidth, etc.

   In addition, one could potentially choose to have some traffic
   engineering information distributed via an IGP-TE protocol while
   other more specialized traffic information is only conveyed to the
   PCEs. For example, it makes sense to distribute "static" (rarely
   modified) and sizable data (e.g., NE switching asymmetry structure)
   via methods other than IGP-TE while more frequently changed data via
   IGP-TE. This could significantly decrease the IGP-TE information and
   its footprint on all nodes.

   The benefits of such an approach include:

   o  Node: reduced storage demands (doesn't keep the entire TED)

   o  Node: reduced processing demands for TED updates and
      synchronization

   o  Control Plane: reduced overall communication demands since the
      TED is not being updated and maintained on all nodes in the
      network.

   o  PCE: More timely TED updates are possible.

   o  Information distribution constraints, such as seen in [Imp-Frame]
      can be met.

   To quantify the previous advantages requires a bit more detail on
   how such an approach could actually be accomplished. The key pieces
   needed to implement such an approach include:

   o  Multiple PCEs must be supported for robustness and load sharing.

   o  Nodes must be able to find a PCE to which to send their traffic
      engineering information.

   o  Nodes must have procedures and a mechanism (protocols) with which
      to communicate their TE information to a PCE. PCEs must have
      procedures and a mechanism (protocols) with which to receive this
      TE information from nodes.

   o  Efficient mechanisms must exist in the multi-PCE case to ensure
      all PCEs have the same TED.

   The advantages of using an alternative to IGP-TE comes at the cost
   of:

   o  Additional protocols to be configured and secured. Recall that we
      still must have an IP IGP for control plane communications.

   o  Any new protocols/implementations for alternative TED creation
      still must support many IGP-TE like features such as removal of
      stale information, reliable delivery of updates to all
      participants, recovery after reboots/crashes/upgrades, etc. It
      should also work along with IGP-TE/BGP-LS TED mechanism with some
      information in the TED received from existing mechanisms.

   o  Mechanisms to discover PCEs that are capable and willing to
      accept direct TED updates.

2.1. Architecture Options

   There are three general architectural alternatives based on how
   nodes get their local TED information to the PCEs: (1) Nodes send
   local information to all PCEs; (2) Nodes send local information to
   an intermediate server that will send to all PCEs; (3) Nodes send
   local information to at least one PCE and have the PCEs share this
   information with each other. An important functionality that needs
   to be addressed in each of these approaches is how a new PCE gets
   initialized in a reasonably timely fashion.

   Figures 1-3 show examples of three options for nodes to share local
   TED information with multiple PCEs. As in the IGP case we assume
   that switching nodes know their local properties and state including
   the state of all their local links. In these figures the data plane
   links are shown with the character "o"; TE information flow from
   nodes to PCE by the characters "|", "-", "/", or "\"; and PCE to PCE
   TE information, if any, by the character "i".

2.1.1. Nodes Send TE Info to all PCEs

   Architectural alternative 1 shown in Figure 1, illustrates nodes
   sending their local TE information to all PCEs within their domain.
   As the number of PCEs grows we have scalability concerns. However,
   if we are only talking about 2-3 PCEs, then we do not have this
   scalability concern. In particular each node needs to keep track of
   which PCE it has sent information to and update that information
   periodically.

   If a new PCE is added to the domain the node must send all its local
   TED information to that PCE rather than just sending status updates.

2.1.2. Nodes Send TE Info via an Intermediate System

   Architecture alternative 2 is shown in Figure 2. This architecture
   reduces the burden on switching nodes by having the nodes send TE
   information to an intermediate system. This general approach is
   typically described in the software literature as a
   publish/subscribe paradigm. Here the nodes send their local TED
   information to an intermediate entity whose job is to insure that
   all PCEs receive this information. The nodes in this case being the
   publishers of the information and the PCEs the subscribers of the
   information. Publish/subscribe functionality can be found in general
   messaging oriented middleware such as the Java Messaging Service
   [JMS] and many others.  A routing specific example of this approach
   is seen in BGP route reflectors [RFC4456].

   Note that the publish/subscribe entity can be collocated with a PCE.
   This would then looks like a master/slave type system architecture.

   If a new PCE is added then the intermediate server will need to work
   with this new PCE to initialize its TED. Hence the publish/subscribe
   entity will need to also keep a copy of the entire TED and for
   reliability purposes a redundant server would be required. The
   publish/subscribe entity itself can be a PCE.

   Architecture alternative 2 could be useful when there are a number
   of PCEs in the network and as such there is the scaling issue with
   each of the NEs talking to all the PCEs. The advantage of this
   alternative would diminish when we are dealing only with only a few
   PCEs.

2.1.3. Nodes Send TE Info to At Least One PCE

   In this architectural alternative, shown in Figure 3, each node
   would be associated with at least one PCE. This implies that each
   PCE will only have partial TED information directly from the nodes.
   It would be the responsibility of a node to get its local TED
   information to its associated PCE, then the PCEs within a domain
   would then need to share the partial TED information they learned
   from their associated nodes with each other so that they can create
   and maintain the complete TED. As we have seen in section 1.1. this
   is very similar to part of the functionality provided by a link
   state protocol, but in this case the protocol would be used between
   PCEs so that they can share the information they have obtained from
   their associated switching nodes (rather than from attached links as
   in a regular link state protocol).  To allow for this sharing of
   information PCEs would need to peer with each other. PCE discovery
   extensions [RFC4674] could be used to allow PCEs to find other PCEs.
   If a new PCE is added to the domain it would need to peer with at
   least one other PCE and then link state protocol procedures for TED
   synchronization could then be used to initialize the new PCEs TED.

   A number of approaches can be used to ensure control plane
   resilience in this architecture. (1) Each node can be configured
   with a primary and a secondary PCE to send its information to; In
   case of failure of communications with the primary PCE the node
   would send its information to a secondary PCE (warm standby). (2)
   Each node could be configured to send its information to two
   different PCEs (hot standby).

2.2. Nodes Finding PCEs

   In cases 1 and 3 nodes need to send TE information directly to PCEs.
   Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and network nodes participating in
   an IGP (with or without TE extensions) have a mechanism to discover
   a PCE and its capabilities.  [RFC4674] outlines the general
   requirements for this mechanism and extensions have been defined to
   provide information so that PCCs can obtain key details about
   available PCEs in OSPF [RFC5088] and in IS-IS [RFC5089].

   After finding candidate PCEs, a node would need to see which if any
   of the PCEs actually want to receive TE information directly from
   this node.

   In architectural alternative 2 (publish/subscribe) the location of
   intermediate system would either need to be configured or PCE
   discovery could be extended so that a when a node asks a PCE if it

   wants to hear TE info the PCE points it to the intermediate
   publish/subscribe system.

2.3. Node TE Information Update Procedures

   First a node must establish an association between itself and a PCE
   or intermediate system that will be maintaining a TED. It is the
   responsibility of the node to share TE information concerning its
   local environment, e.g., links and node properties. General and
   technology specific information models would specify the content of
   this information while the specific protocols would determine the
   format. Note that a node would not be sending to the PCE information
   it might be passed from neighbor nodes. Note that data plane
   neighbor information would be passed to the PCE embedded in TE link
   information.

   There will be cases where the node would have to send to the PCE
   only a subset of TE link information depending on the path
   computation option. For instance, if the node is responsible for
   routing while the PCE is responsible for wavelength assignment for
   the route, the node would only need to send the PCE the WSON link
   usage information. This path computation option is referred to as
   separate Fouting (R) and Wavelength Assignment (WA) option in [PCE-
   WSON].

2.4. PCE TED Maintenance Procedures

   The PCE is responsible for creating and maintaining the TED that it
   will use. Key functions include:

     1. Establishing and authenticating communications between the PCE
        and sources of TED information.

     2. Timely updates of the TED with information received from nodes,
        peers or other entities.

     3. Verifying the validity of information in the TED,i.e., ensure
        that the network information obtained from nodes or elsewhere
        is relatively timely, or not stale. By analogy with similar
        functionality provided by IGPs this can be done via a process
        where discrete "chunks" of TED information are "aged" and
        discard when expired. This combined with nodes periodically
        resending their local TE information leads to a timely TED.

3. Standardization and Protocol Considerations

   In the previous section we examined a number of architectural
   alternatives for TED creation and maintenance between PCE(s) and the
   network. Here we examine aspects of these alternatives that could be
   suitable for standardization. First there are a number of functions
   which are independent of the particular architectural alternatives,
   these include:

   o  An information model for the TED

   o  Basic PCE TED creation and maintenance procedures

   o  Information packaging for use in TED creation, maintenance and
      exchange

   o  NE to PCE (or Pub/Sub) communication of TED information ---
      interface and protocol (e.g. PCEP)

   o  NEs discovering PCE (or Pub/Sub) for TED creation and maintenance
      purposes

   By the "information model" for the TED we mean the raw information
   that a path computation algorithm would work with somewhat
   independent of how it might be packaged for TED maintenance and
   creation. Initial efforts along these lines have started at CCAMP
   for wavelength switched optical networks for non-impairment RWA
   [WSON-Info] and impairment aware RWA [WSON-IMP-Info].

   Given a TED information model if we can agree on basic PCE TED
   creation and maintenance procedures we can then come up with a
   standardized way to package the information for use in such
   procedures. The analogy here is with an IGPs database maintenance
   procedures such as aging and the packaging of link state information
   information into LSA (link state advertisements). LSAs form the
   basic chunks of an IGP's database. OSPF LSAs include an age field to
   assist in the ageing procedure and also has an advertising router
   field that aids in redistribution decisions, i.e., flooding. However
   the detailed TE information is encoded in LSAs via type length value
   (TLV) structures and it is this information that is used in path
   computation.

   From there we could standardize the interface between a NE and a PCE
   for communication of TE information. This interface includes NE and
   PCE behaviors as well as a communications protocol.

Internet-Draft            PCE TED transport                   July 2014


   Finally for the common behaviors we need a way for the NEs to find
   the PCEs or an intermediate publish/subscribe system to which they
   will send their TE information. As was previously pointed out this
   could be based on small enhancements to existing PCE discovery
   mechanisms.

3.1. Architecture Specific Standardization Aspects

   Case 1: NEs send to all PCEs

   This case has commonalities with both cases 2 and 3 and does not
   appear to have unique standardization aspects. As pointed out in
   section 2.1. We do need to consider when a new PCE comes online.

   Case 2: Publish/Subscribe Server

      In this case we would need to additionally standardize

     1. how a new PCE coming online synchronizes with the
        publish/subscribe server

     1. how PCEs and publish subscribe server communicate

     2. Redundancy for publish subscribe server

   Case 3: PCE to PCE sharing TE information learned from NEs

   Here we would need the following additional mechanisms standardized:

     1. The PCE to PCE interface and protocol

     2. The method for PCEs to discover PCEs for the purpose of TE
        information sharing

     3. PCE to PCE association for information sharing, in particular
        sharing update information.

4. Security Considerations

   This draft discusses an alternative technique for PCEs to build and
   maintain a traffic engineering database. In this approach network
   nodes would directly send traffic engineering information to a PCE.
   It may be desirable to protect such information from disclosure to
   unauthorized parties in addition it may be desirable to protect such
   communications from interference (modification) since they can be
   critical to the operation of the network. In particular, this
   information is the same or similar to that which would be

   disseminated via a link state routing protocol with traffic
   engineering extensions.

5. IANA Considerations

   This version of this document does not introduce any items for IANA
   to consider.

6. Conclusions

   to create and maintain a traffic engineering database (TED) via
   information directly or indirectly received from network elements
   and identified common aspects of these approaches. The TED is a
   critical piece of the overall PCE architecture since without it path
   computations cannot proceed. Though not explicitly out of scope the
   PCE working group does not have a work item or study item devoted to
   TED creation and maintenance. Such a work item can lead to enhanced
   interoperability and simplicity of PCE implementations. This
   document identified several common areas within these alternatives
   that could be standardized. In addition, the alternative approaches
   to TED creation and maintenance discussed here offloads both the
   network nodes and routing protocols from either some or all TED
   creation and maintenance duties at the same time it does not add
   significant new processing to a PCE that has already been
   participating in IGP based TED creation and maintenance.
