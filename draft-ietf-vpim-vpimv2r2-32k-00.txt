1. Abstract 
    
   This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type 
   audio/32KADPCM for toll quality audio.  This audio encoding is 
   defined by the ITU-T in Recommendation G.726.  This document refines 
   an earlier sub-type registration in RFC 1911. 
    
   This document obsoletes RFC 2422. 
    
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119. 
    
    
3. ITU-T Definition 
  
   Recommendation G.726 [G726] defines the characteristics that are 
   recommended for the conversion of a 64 kbit/s A-law or mu-law pulse 
   code modulation (PCM) channel at 8000 samples/second to and from a 
   40, 32, 24 or 16 kbit/s channel. The conversion is applied to the PCM 
   bit stream using an adaptive differential pulse code modulation

   (ADPCM) transcoding technique.  This Recommendation obsoletes G.721 
   which only defined the 32 kbit/s characteristics. 
    
   Recommendation G.726 was prepared by Study Group 15 of the 
   Telecommunications Standardization Sector of the International 
   Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) and was approved under the ITU's 
   Resolution No. 2 procedure on the 14 of December 1990. 
    
    
4. MIME Definition 
    
    
 
4.1 audio/32KADPCM 

   CCITT Recommendation G.726 [G726] describes the algorithm recommended 
   for conversion of a 64 kbit/s A-law or mu-law PCM channel to and from 
   a 32 kbit/s channel(this is the same algorithm as described in the 
   deprecated G.721). The conversion is applied to the PCM stream using 
   an Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) transcoding 
   technique. 
    
   The MIME sub-type audio/32KADPCM is defined to hold binary audio data 
   encoded in 32 kbit/s ADPCM exactly as defined by ITU-T Recommendation 
   G.726. No header information shall be included as part of the audio 
   data. The content transfer encoding is typically either binary or 
   base64. 
    
   An additional consideration that this document defines for clarity is 
   the choice of little endian ordering of the four bit code words. This 
   default ordering is defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.420 [X420] for 
   the equivalent X.400 body part, but is also detailed below in the 
   IANA Registration. 
 

4.2 VPIM Usage
               

   The audio/32KADPCM sub-type is a primary component of the VPIM 
   specification [VPIM2R2].  In this context, the Content-Description 
   and Content-Disposition headers are used to succinctly describe the   
   contents of the audio body.  As well, only the little endian bit   
   ordering is valid.  Refer to the VPIM Specifcation for proper usage.

      Binary or Base-64 generally preferred 
    
      Security considerations: 
    
         There are no known security risks with the sending or 
         playing of raw audio data  Audio data is typically 
         interpreted only by an audio codec.  Unintended information 
         introduced into the data stream will result in noise. 
    
    
      Interoperability considerations: 
    
         The four bit code word ordering within a byte may differ 
         between existing implementations of G.726 codecs.  Since 
         this content only permits the little endian ordering, codecs 
         that support the opposite ordering must reorder the code 
         words before storing to or retrieving from this content 
         type. 
    
    
      Published specification: 
    
         ITU-T G.726 with little endian ordering 
    
      Applications which use this media type: 
    
         primarily voice messaging 
    
      Additional information: 
    
         Magic number(s): ? 
         File extension(s): .726 
    
      Little Endian Ordering: 
    
         The 4-bit code words of the G.726 encoding MUST be packed 
         into octets/bytes as follows:  the first code word (A) is 
         placed in the four least significant bits of the first 
         octet, with the least significant bit (LSB) of the code word 
         (A0) in the least significant bit of the octet;  the second 
         code word (B) is placed in the four most significant bits of 
         the first octet, with the most significant bit (MSB) of the 
         code word (B3) in the most significant bit of the octet. 
         Subsequent pairs of the code words shall be packed in the 
         same way into successive octets, with the first code word of 
         each pair placed in the least significant four bits of the 
         octet.  It is preferred that the voice sample be extended 
         with silence such that the encoded value comprises an even 
         number of code words.  However, if the voice sample 
         comprises an odd number of code words, then the last code 
         word shall be discarded.

6. Security Considerations

   audio data  Audio data is typically interpreted only by an audio 
   codec.  Unintended information introduced into the data stream will
