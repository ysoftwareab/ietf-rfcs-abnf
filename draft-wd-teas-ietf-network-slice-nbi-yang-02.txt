1.  Introduction

   This document provides a YANG [RFC7950] data model for the IETF
   Network Slice NBI.

   The YANG model discussed in this document is defined based on the
   description of the IETF Network Slice in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] and
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework], which is used to operate IETF Network
   Slice during the IETF Network Slice instantiation.  This YANG model
   supports various oprations on IETF Network Slices such as creation,
   modification, deletion, and monitoring of IETF Network Slices.

Internet-Draft      IETF Network Slice NBI YANG model      February 2021


   The IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC) provides a Northbound
   Interface (NBI) that allows consumers of network slices to request
   and monitor IETF network slices.  Consumers operate on abstract IETF
   network slices, with details related to their realization hidden.

   The NSC takes requests from a management system or other application
   via an NBI.  This interface carries data objects the IETF network
   slice user provides, describing the needed IETF network slices in
   terms of topology, applicable service level objectives (SLO), and any
   monitoring and reporting requirements that may apply.  The NBI
   conveys the generic IETF network slice requirements.  These may then
   be realized using an SBI within the NSC.

   The YANG model discussed in this document describes the requirements
   of an IETF Network Slice from the point of view of the consumer,
   which is classified as Customer Service Model in [RFC8309].

   It will be up to the management system or NSC (IETF Network Slice
   controller) to take this model as an input and use other management
   system or specific configuration models to configure the different
   network elements to deliver an IETF Network Slice.  The YANG models
   can be used with network management protocols such as NETCONF
   [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The details of how the IETF network
   slices are realized by the NSC is out of scope for this document.

   The IETF Network Slice operational state is included in the same tree
   as the configuration consistent with Network Management Datastore
   Architecture [RFC8342].

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are used in this
   specification:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  state data

   This document makes use of the following terminology introduced in
   the YANG 1.1 Data Modeling Language [RFC7950]:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   This document also makes use of the following terminology introduced
   in the IETF Network Slice definition draft
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition]:

   o  NBI: Northbound Interface

   o  NS: IETF Network Slice

   o  NSC: IETF Network Slice Controller

   o  NSE: Network Slice Endpoint

   o  SLO: Service Level Objective

   This document defines the following new terminology:

   o  IETF Network Slice Member (Network-Slice-Member): In the context
      of an IETF Network Slice, an IETF Network-Slice-Member is an
      abstract entity which represents a particular connection between a
      pair of NSEs.  An IETF Network Slice can has one or multiple
      members.

2.1.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

3.  IETF Network Slice NBI Model Usage

   The intention of the IETF Network Slice NBI model is to allow the
   consumer, e.g. a higher level management system, to request and
   monitor IETF Network Slices.  In particular, the model allows
   consumers to operate in an abstract, technology-agnostic manner, with
   realization details hidden.

   According to the [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition]
   description, the NBI model is applicable to use case such as (but not
   limited to) Network wholesale services, Network infrastructure
   sharing among operators, NFV connectivity and Data Center
   Interconnect and 5G E2E network slice.

Internet-Draft      IETF Network Slice NBI YANG model      February 2021


   As Figure 1 shows, in all these use-cases, the NBI model is used by
   the higher management system (i.e the consumer of the IETF network
   slice controller ) to communicate with IETF Network Slice controller
   for life cycle manage of IETF Network Slices including both
   enablement and monitoring.  For example, in 5G E2E network slicing
   use-case the E2E network slice orchestrator acts as the higher layer
   system to request the IETF Network Slices.  The interface is used to
   support dynamic IETF Network Slice creation and its lifecycle
   management to facilitate end-to-end network slice services.

4.  IETF Network Slice NBI Model Overview

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition], an IETF
   network slice is a logical network connecting a number of endpoints
   with specified SLOs.  The connectivity can be point-to-point,
   multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-multipoint.
   In addition, a minimum set of SLOs is defined, including but not
   limited to bandwidth, delay, and etc.  An example of an IETF network
   slice is shown in Figure 2 .

                  Figure 2: An IETF Network Slice Example

   Draft [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] introduces the
   IETF network slice endpoints (NSEs) which are conceptual points of
   connection to IETF network slice.  As such, they are ingress/egress
   point where the traffic enters/exits the IETF network slice.  In
   other words, they are the edge of the IETF network slices.

   When IETF network slice controller (NSC) receives a message via its
   NBI for creation/modification of an IETF network slice, it uses the
   provided IETF network slice endpoints to map them to appropriate
   services/tunnels/paths endpoints in the underlay IETF network.  It
   then uses services/tunnels/paths endpoints to realize the IETF
   network slice.

   The IETF Network Slice ("ietf-network-slice") is defined to manage
   network slices in the IETF network.  In particular, the 'ietf-
   network-slice' module can be used to create, modify, and monitor
   network slices of an IETF network.

   The 'ietf-network-slice' module uses two main nodes: list 'ietf-
   network-slice' and container 'ns-templates' (see Figure 3).

   The 'ietf-network-slice' list includes the set of IETF Network slices
   managed within IETF network. 'ietf-network-slice' is the data
   structure that abstracts an IETF Network Slice.  Under the "ietf-
   network-slice", list "ns-endpoint" is used to abstract the NSEs, e.g.
   NSEs in the example above.

   The 'ns-templates' container is used by the NSC to maintain a set of
   common network slice templates that apply to one or several IETF
   Network Slices.

5.  IETF Network Slice Templates

   The 'ns-templates' container (Figure 3) is used by service provider
   of the NSC to define and maintain a set of common IETF Network Slice
   templates that apply to one or several IETF Network Slices.  The
   exact definition of the templates is deployment specific to each
   network provider.  The model includes only the identifiers of SLO-
   templates.  When creation of IETF Network slice, the SLO policies can
   be easily identified.

   The following shows an example where two network slice templates can
   be retrieved by the upper layer management system:

6.  IETF Network Slice Modeling Description

   The 'ietf-network-slice' is the data structure that abstracts an IETF
   Network Slice of the IETF network.  Each 'ietf-network-slice' is
   uniquely identified by an identifier: 'ns-id'.

   An IETF Network Slice has the following main parameters:

   o  "ns-id": Is an identifier that is used to uniquely identify the
      IETF Network Slice within NSC.

   o  "ns-description": May be provided to help identify an IETF Network
      Slice.

   o  "ns-topology": Indicates the network topology for the IETF Network
      Slice: Hub-Spoke, Any-to-Any, and Custom.

   o  "status": Enable the control of the operative and administrative
      status of the IETF Network Slice, can be used as indicator to
      detect network slice anomalies.

   o  "ns-tag": The list is to show the correlation between higher level
      function and the IETF network slices.  If provided, this parameter
      may be used by IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC) during the
      realization.  It may also be used by NSC for monitoring and
      assurance of the IETF network slices where NSC can notify the
      higher system by issuing the notifications.  It is noted that a
      single higher level consumer might have multiple IETF Network
      Slices for a single application.  This attribute may be used by
      NSC to also correlated multiple IETF network slices for a single
      application.

   o  "ns-slo-policy": Defines SLO policy for the "ietf-network-slice".
      More description are provided in Section 6.1

   The "ns-endpoint" is an abstrac entity that represents a set of
   matching rules applied to an IETF network edge device or a customer
   network edge device involved in the IETF Network Slice and each 'ns-
   endpoint' belongs to a single 'ietf-network-slice'.  More description
   are provided in Section 6.3

6.1.  IETF Network Slice Topology

   An IETF Network Slice can be point-to-point (P2P), point-to-
   multipoint (P2MP), multipoint-to-point (MP2P), or multipoint-to-
   multipoint (MP2MP) based on the consumer's traffic pattern
   requirements.

   Therefore, the "ns-topology" under the node "ietf-network-slice" is
   required for configuration.  The model supports any-to-any, Hub and
   Spoke (where Hubs can exchange traffic), and the different
   combinations.  New topologies could be added via augmentation.  By
   default, the any-to-any topology is used.

   In addition, "ep-role" under the node "ns-endpoint" also needs to be
   defined, which specifies the role of the NSE in a particular Network
   Slice topology.  In the any-to-any topology, all NSEs MUST have the
   same role, which will be "any-to-any-role".  In the Hub-and-Spoke
   topology, NSEs MUST have a Hub role or a Spoke role.

6.2.  IETF Network Slice SLO Policy

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition], the SLO
   policy of an IETF Network Slice defines the minimum IETF Network
   Slice SLO attributes, and additional attributes can be added as
   needed.

   "ns-slo-policy" is used to represent a specific SLO policy.  During
   the creation of an IETF Network Slice, the policy can be specified
   either by a standard SLO template or a customized SLO policy.

   The model allows multiple SLO attributes to be combined to meet
   different SLO requirements.  For example, some NSs are used for video
   services and require high bandwidth, some NSs are used for key
   business services and request low latency and reliability, and some
   NSs need to provide connections for a large number of NSEs.  That is,
   not all SLO attributes must be specified to meet the particular
   requirements of a slice.

   "ns-metric-bounds" contains all these variations, which includes a
   list of "ns-metric-bound" and each "ns-metric-bound" could specify a
   particular "metric-type". "metric-type" is defined with YANG identity
   and the YANG module supports the following options:

      "network-slice-slo-bandwidth": Indicates the guaranteed minimum
      bandwidth between any two NSE.  The unit is data rate per second.
      And the bandwidth is unidirectional.

      "network-slice-slo-one-way-delay": Indicates the maximum one-way
      latency between two NSE.  The unit is micro seconds.

      "network-slice-slo-two-way-delay": Indicates the maximum round
      trip latency between two NSE.  The unit is micro seconds.

      "network-slice-slo-jitter": Indicates the jitter constraint of the
      slice maximum permissible delay variation, and is measured by the
      difference in the one- way delay between sequential packets in a
      flow.

      "network-slice-slo-loss": Indicates maximum permissible packet
      loss rate, which is defined by the ratio of packets dropped to
      packets transmitted between two endpoints.

      "network-slice-slo-availability": Is defined as the ratio of up-
      time to total_time(up-time+down-time), where up-time is the time
      the IETF Network Slice is available in accordance with the SLOs
      associated with it.

   Some other Network Slice objectives, such as MTU and security which
   can be added when needed.  MTU specifies the maximum packet length
   that the network slice guarantee to be able to carry across.

   Note: About the definition of SLO parameters, the author is
   discussing to reuse the TE-Types grouping definition as much as
   possible, to avoid duplication of definitions.

   The following shows an example where a network slice policy can be
   configured:

6.3.  IETF Network Slice Endpoint (NSE)

   An IETF Network Slice Endpoint has several characteristics:

   o  "ep-id": Uniquely identifies the NSE within Network Slice
      Controller (NSC).  The identifier is a string that allows any
      encoding for the local administration of the IETF Network Slice.

   o  "location": is NSE location information that facilities NSC easy
      identification of a NSE.

   o  "ep-role": Is a topology role of a NSE belonging to an IETF
      network slice, as described in Section 6.1.  The "ep-role" leaf
      defines the role of the endpoint in a particular NS topology.  In
      the NS any-to-any topology, all NSEs MUST have the same role,
      which will be "any-to-any-role".

   o  "node-id": is NSE node information that facilities NSC easy
      identification of a NSE.

   o  "ep-ip": is NSE IP information that facilities NSC easy
      identification of a NSE.

   o  "ns-match-criteria": Is used to define matching policies to apply
      on a given NSE.

Internet-Draft      IETF Network Slice NBI YANG model      February 2021


   o  "ep-network-access": Is the list that includes the interfaces
      attached to an edge device of the IETF Network Slice by which the
      customer traffic is received.

   o  "ep-rate-limit": Is to set rate-limiting policies to apply on a
      given NSE, including ingress and egress traffic to ensure access
      security.  When applied in the incoming direction, the rate-limit
      is applicable to the traffic from the NSE to the IETF scope
      Network that passes through the external interface.  When
      Bandwidth is applied to the outgoing direction, it is applied to
      the traffic from the IETF Network to the NSE of that particular
      NS.

   o  "ep-protocol": Specify the protocol for a NSE for exchanging
      control-plane information, e.g.  L1 signaling protocol or L3
      routing protocols,etc.

   o  "status": Enable the control of the operative and administrative
      status of the NSE, can be used as indicator to detect NSE
      anomalies.

   An NSE belong to a single IETF Network Slice.  An IETF Network Slice
   involves two or more NSEs.  An IETF Network Slice can be modified by
   adding new "ns-endpoint" or removing existing "ns-endpoint".

   A NSE is used to define the matching rule on the customer traffic
   that can be injected to an IETF Network Slice.  "network-slice-match-
   criteria" is defined to support different options.  Classification
   can be based on many criteria, such as:

   o  Physical interface: Indicates all the traffic received from the
      interface belongs to the IETF Network Slice.

   o  Logical interface: For example, a given VLAN ID is used to
      identify an IETF Network Slice.

   o  Encapsulation in the traffic header: For example, a source IP
      address is used to identify an IETF Network Slice.

   To illustrate the use of NSE parameters, the below are two examples.
   How the NSC realize the mapping is out of scope for this document.

   o  NSE mapping to PE example: As shown in Figure 4 , consumer of the
      IETF network slice would like to connect two NSEs to satisfy
      specific service, e.g., Network wholesale services.  In this case,
      the IETF network slice endpoints are mapped to physical interfaces
      of PE nodes.  The IETF network slice controller (NSC) uses "node-

      endpoints (NSE) might be mapped to tunnels endpoints on CE nodes
      (see 3GPP TS 28.541 V17.1.0 section 6.3.17 EP_Transport).  The
      IETF network slice controller (NSC) uses "node-id" (CE device ID)
      , "ep-ip" (CE tunnel endpoint IP), "network-slice-match-criteria"
      (VLAN interface), "ep-network-access" (Two nexthop interfaces ) to

7.  IETF Network Slice Monitoring

   An IETF Network Slice is a connectivity with specific SLO
   characteristics, including bandwidth, QoS metric, etc.  The
   connectivity is a combination of logical connections, represented by
   Network-Slice-Members.

   This model also describes performance status of an IETF Network
   Slice.  The statistics are described in the following granularity:

   o  Per NS connection: specified in 'network-slice-member-monitoring'
      under the "network-slice-member"

   o  Per NS Endpoint: specified in 'endpoint-monitoring' under the
      "network-slice-endpoint"

   This model does not define monitoring enabling methods.  The
   mechanism defined in [RFC8640] and [RFC8641] can be used for either
   periodic or on-demand subscription.

   By specifying subtree filters or xpath filters to 'ns-member' or 'ns-
   endpoint' ,so that only interested contents will be sent.  These
   mechanisms can be used for monitoring the IETF Network Slice
   performance status so that the client management system could
   initiate modification based on the IETF Network Slice running status.

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   o /ietf-network-slice/ietf-network-slices/ietf-network-slice

   The entries in the list above include the whole network
   configurations corresponding with the slice which the higher
   management system requests, and indirectly create or modify the PE or
   P device configurations.  Unexpected changes to these entries could
   lead to service disruption and/or network misbehavior.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested to be made:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-slice
      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.



   This document requests to register a YANG module in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC7950].

Appendix B.  Comparison with Other Possible Design choices for IETF
             Network Slice NBI

   According to the 3.3.1.  Northbound Inteface (NBI)
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework], the IETF Network Slice NBI is a
   technology-agnostic interface, which is used for a consumer to
   express requirements for a particular IETF Network Slice.  Consumers
   operate on abstract IETF Network Slices, with details related to
   their realization hidden.  As classified by [RFC8309], the IETF
   Network Slice NBI is classified as Customer Service Model.

   This draft analyzes the following existing IETF models to identify
   the gap between the IETF Network Slice NBI requirements.

Internet-Draft      IETF Network Slice NBI YANG model      February 2021


B.1.  ACTN VN Model Augmentation

   The difference between the ACTN VN model and the IETF Network Slice
   NBI requirements is that the IETF Network Slice NBI is a technology-
   agnostic interface, whereas the VN model is bound to the IETF TE
   Topologies.  The realization of the IETF Network Slice does not
   necessarily require the slice network to support the TE technology.

   The ACTN VN (Virtual Network) model introduced in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] is the abstract consumer view of the TE
   network.  Its YANG structure includes four components:

   o  VN: A Virtual Network (VN) is a network provided by a service
      provider to a customer for use and two types of VN has defined.
      The Type 1 VN can be seen as a set of edge-to-edge abstract links.
      Each link is an abstraction of the underlying network which can
      encompass edge points of the customer's network, access links,
      intra-domain paths, and inter-domain links.

   o  AP: An AP is a logical identifier used to identify the access link
      which is shared between the customer and the IETF scoped Network.

   o  VN-AP: A VN-AP is a logical binding between an AP and a given VN.

   o  VN-member: A VN-member is an abstract edge-to-edge link between
      any two APs or VN-APs.  Each link is formed as an E2E tunnel
      across the underlying networks.

   The Type 1 VN can be used to describe IETF Network Slice connection
   requirements.  However, the Network Slice SLO and Network Slice
   Endpoint are not clearly defined and there's no direct equivalent.
   For example, the SLO requirement of the VN is defined through the
   IETF TE Topologies YANG model, but the TE Topologies model is related
   to a specific implementation technology.  Also, VN-AP does not define
   "network-slice-match-criteria" to specify a specific NSE belonging to
   an IETF Network Slice.

B.2.  RFC8345 Augmentation Model

   The difference between the IETF Network Slice NBI requirements and
   the IETF basic network model is that the IETF Network Slice NBI
   requests abstract consumer IETF Network Slices, with details related
   to the slice Network hidden.  But the IETF network model is used to
   describe the interconnection details of a Network.  The customer
   service model does not need to provide details on the Network.

   For example, IETF Network Topologies YANG data model extension
   introduced in Transport Network Slice YANG Data Model

Internet-Draft      IETF Network Slice NBI YANG model      February 2021


   [I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang] includes three major
   parts:

   o  Network: a transport network list and an list of nodes contained
      in the network

   o  Link: "links" list and "termination points" list describe how
      nodes in a network are connected to each other

   o  Support network: vertical layering relationships between IETF
      Network Slice networks and underlay networks

   Based on this structure, the IETF Network Slice-specific SLO
   attributes nodes are augmented on the Network Topologies model,, e.g.
   isolation etc.  However, this modeling design requires the slice
   network to expose a lot of details of the network, such as the actual
   topology including nodes interconnection and different network layers
   interconnection.

Appendix C.  Appendix B IETF Network Slice Match Criteria

   5G is a use case of the IETF Network Slice and 5G End-to-end Network
   Slice Mapping from the view of IETF Network
   [I-D.geng-teas-network-slice-mapping]

   defines two types of Network Slice interconnection and
   differentiation methods: by physical interface or by TNSII (Transport
   Network Slice Interworking Identifier).  TNSII is a field in the
   packet header when different 5G wireless network slices are
   transported through a single physical interfaces of the IETF scoped
   Network.  In the 5G scenario, "network-slice-match-criteria" refers
   to TNSII.

   As shown in the figure, gNodeB 1 and gNodeB 2 use IP gNB1 and IP gNB2
   to communicate with the IETF network, respectively.  In addition, the
   traffic of NS1 and NS2 on gNodeB 1 and gNodeB 2 is transmitted
   through the same access links to the IETF slice network.  The IETF
   slice network need to to distinguish different IETF Network Slice
   traffic of same gNB.  Therefore, in addition to using "node-id" and
   "port-id" to identify a Network Slice Endpont, other information is
