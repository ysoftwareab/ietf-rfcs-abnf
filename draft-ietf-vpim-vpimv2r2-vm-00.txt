Status of this Memo 
 
   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with 
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.  
    
   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering 
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that 
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts. Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of 
   six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other 
   documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts 
   as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in 
   progress."

1. Abstract 
    
   This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type 
   multipart/voice-message for use with the Voice Profile for Internet 
   Mail(VPIM). A full description of usage can be found in the VPIM v2 
   specification [VPIM2]. This document revises an earlier sub-type 
   registration in RFC 1911 [VPIM1]. 
    
   This document obsoletes RFC 2423. 
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119. 
    
    
3. VPIM Scope 
 
   The VPIM specification defines a restricted profile of the Internet 
   multimedia messaging protocols for use between voice processing 
   platforms. These platforms have historically been special-purpose 
   computers and often do not have the same facilities normally 
   associated with a traditional Internet Email-capable computer. As a 
   result, VPIM also specifies additional functionality as it is 
   needed. The profile is intended to specify the minimum common set of 
   features to allow interworking between compliant systems.

4. Voice Message Interchange 
 
 
4.1 multipart/voice-message 
 
   The MIME sub-type multipart/voice-message is defined to hold 
   specific media contents that are interchanged in messages between 
   voice messaging systems described in [VPIM2R2]. Essentially, the 
   sub-type provides a simple wrapper that easily identifies the entire 
   content as being the components of a single voice message.  The sub-
   type is identical in semantics and syntax to multipart/mixed, as 
   defined in [MIME2]. As such, it may be safely interpreted as a 
   multipart/mixed by systems that do not understand the sub-type (only 
   the identification as a voice message would be lost). 
    
   This mechanism allows the insertion of an explanatory preamble (e.g.   
   VPIM voice message attached) for recipients who read the message 
   with pre-MIME software, since the preamble will be ignored by MIME-   
   compliant software. 
    
   In addition to the MIME required boundary parameter, a version 
   parameter is also required for this sub-type.  This is to 
   distinguish, this refinement of the sub-type from the previous 
   definition in [VPIM1].  The value of the version parameter is "2.0" 
   if the content conforms to the requirements of [VPIM2R2].  Should 
   here be further revisions of this content type, there MUST be 
   backwards compatibility (i.e. systems implementing version n can 
   read version 2, and systems implementing version 2 can read version 
   2 contents within a version n).  The default version value (when the 
   parameter is missing) is 1, indicating the content conforms to the 
   requirements of [VPIM1]. 
    
   [VPIM2R2] describes the restriction that only specific media types, 
   applicable to voice messaging, are valid `next-level' contents of 
   this sub-type (when version=2.0).  They are: audio/*, image/*, 
   message/rfc822 and applicationtext/directory.  The multipart 
   provides or the packaging of as many of these contents as is 
   necessary. 
    
3.2 VPIM v2 Usage 
    
   The multipart/voice-message sub-type is a primary component of the 
   VPIM specification [VPIM2R2].  All VPIM Messages MUST contain this 
   sub-type to identify the wrapping of a voice message.  The contents 
   of this wrapper can vary from only one audio/32KADPCM content to a 
   complex set of related and nested contents. 
    
   Typically, if more than one audio segment is present, the first is 
   the spoken name of the originator, the second is the spoken subject, 
   and the third is the voice message itself.  This order, however, 
   MUST NOT be assumed in any case.  Further, the order that the 
   contents appear SHOULD be the order in which they are presented to 
   the user.

   The spoken name segment, if available, shall contain the name of the 
   message sender in the voice of the sender.  The length of the spoken 
   name segment must not exceed 12 seconds. 
    
   The spoken subject segment, if available, shall contain the subject 
   of the message sender in the voice of the sender.  The length of the 
   spoken subject segment must not exceed 20 seconds. 
    
   The directory information part, if present, will contain information 
   specific to the originator of the voice message. 
    
   Refer to the VPIM v2 Specification for details on proper usage. 
    
4. IANA Registration 
    
   To: ietf-types@iana.org 
   Subject: Registration of MIME media type 
            multipart/voice-message 
    
   MIME media type name: multipart 
    
   MIME subtype name: voice-message 
    
   Required parameters: boundary, version 
    
      The use of boundary is defined in [MIME2] 
    
      The version parameter that contains the value "2.0" if 
      enclosed content conforms to [VPIM2R2].  The absence of this 
      parameter indicates conformance to the previous version 
      defined in RFC 1911 [VPIM1]. 
    
   Optional parameters: none 
    
   Encoding considerations: 7bit, 8bit or Binary 
    
   Security considerations: 
    
      This definition identifies the content as being a voice 
      message.  In some environments (though likely not the 
      majority), the loss of the anonymity of the content may be a 
      security issue. 
    
   Interoperability considerations: 
    
      Systems developed to conform with [VPIM1] may not conform to 
      this registration.  Specifically, the required version will 
      likely be absent, in this case the recipient system should 
      still be able to accept the message and will be able to 
      handle the content.  The VPIM v1 positional identification, 
      however, would likely be lost.

5. Security Considerations 
 
   Most security considerations are described in [VPIM2R2].  
    
   This definition identifies the content as being a voice message.  In 
   some environments (though likely not the majority), the loss of the 
   anonymity of the content may be a security issue. 
    
   In addition, implementors should be aware that they may receive 
   invalid content in a mulitpart/voice-message that cannot be 
   processed or stored.  This SHOULD NOT compromise the integrity of 
   the valid contents of message.
