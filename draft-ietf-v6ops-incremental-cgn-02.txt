Abstract 

   Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected. As IPv4 
   address exhaustion approaches, the IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues 
   become more critical and less tractable. Host-based transition

   mechanisms used in dual stack environments are not able to meet the 
   transition requirements. Most end users are not sufficiently expert 
   to configure or maintain host-based transition mechanisms. Carrier-
   Grade NAT (CGN) devices with integrated transition mechanisms can 
   reduce the operational change required during the IPv4 to IPv6 
   migration or coexistence period. 

   This document proposes an incremental CGN approach for IPv6 
   transition. It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6-enabled 
   hosts and IPv4 access services for IPv4 hosts while leaving much of a 
   legacy IPv4 ISP network unchanged. It is suitable for the initial 
   stage of IPv4 to IPv6 migration. Unlike NAT444 based CGN alone, 
   Incremental CGN also supports and encourages transition towards dual-
   stack or IPv6-only ISP networks. A smooth transition to IPv6 
   deployment is also described in this document. 

   An integrated configurable CGN device and an adaptive Home Gateway 
   (HG) device are introduced. Both HG and CGN are re-usable devices 
   during different transition periods. It avoids potential multiple 
   upgrades. It enables IPv6 migration to be incrementally achieved 
   according to the real user requirements.

1. Introduction 

   Global IPv6 deployment did not happen as was forecast 10 years ago. 
   Network providers were hesitant to take the first move while IPv4 was 
   and is still working well. However, IPv4 address exhaustion is 
   imminent. The dynamically-updated IPv4 Address Report [IPUSAGE] has 
   analyzed this issue. It predicts early 2011 for IANA unallocated 
   address pool exhaustion and middle 2012 for RIR unallocated address 
   pool exhaustion. Based on this fact, the Internet industry appears to 
   have reached consensus that global IPv6 deployment is inevitable and 
   has to be done expediently. 

   IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues therefore become more critical and 
   complicated for the soon-coming global IPv6 deployment. Host-based 
   transition mechanisms alone are not able to meet the requirements in 
   all cases. Therefore, network supporting functions and/or new 
   transition mechanisms with simple user-side operation are needed. 

   Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) [I-D.nishitani-cgn], also called NAT444 CGN, 
   alone compounds IPv4 operational problems, but does nothing to 
   encourage IPv4 to IPv6 transition. Deployment of NAT444 CGN allows 
   ISPs to delay the transition, and therefore increased double 
   transition costs (once to add CGN, and again to support IPv6). 

   CGN deployments that integrate multiple transition mechanisms can 
   simplify the operation of end user services during the IPv4 to IPv6 
   migration and coexistence periods. CGNs are deployed on the network 
   side and managed/maintained by professionals. On the user side, new 
   Home Gateway (HG) devices may be needed too. They may be provided by 
   network providers, depending on the specific business model. Dual-
   stack lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], also called DS-Lite, 
   is a CGN-based solution that supports transition, but it requires the 
   ISP to upgrade its network to IPv6 immediately. Many ISPs hesitate to 
   do this as the first step. Theoretically, DS-Lite can be used with 
   double encapsulation (IPv4-in-IPv6-in-IPv4) but this seems even less 
   likely to be accepted by an ISP and is not discussed in this  
   document. 

   This document proposes an incremental CGN approach for IPv6 
   transition. The approach is similar to DS-Lite, but the other way 
   around. It mainly combines v4-v4 NAT with v6-over-v4 tunneling 
   functions. It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6-enabled hosts 
   and IPv4 access services for IPv4 hosts, while leaving most of legacy 
   IPv4 ISP networks unchanged. The deployment of this technology does 
   not affect legacy IPv4 hosts with global IPv4 addresses at all. It is

   suitable for the initial stage of IPv4 to IPv6 migration. It also 
   supports transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks. 

   A smooth transition mechanism is also described in this document. It 
   introduces an integrated configurable CGN device and an adaptive HG 
   device. Both CGN and HG are re-usable devices during different 
   transition periods. It avoid potential multiple upgrade. It enables 
   IPv6 migration to be incrementally achieved according to the real 
   user requirements. 

2. An Incremental CGN Approach 

   Most consumers remain primarily IPv4. Network providers are starting 
   to provide IPv6 access services for end users. At the initial stage 
   of IPv4 to IPv6 migration, IPv4 connectivity and traffic would 
   continue to represent the majority of traffic for most ISP networks. 
   ISPs would like to minimize the changes to their IPv4 networks. 
   Switching the whole ISP network into IPv6-only would be considered as 
   a radical strategy. Switching the whole ISP network to dual stack is 
   less radical, but introduces operational costs and complications. 
   Although some ISPs have successfully deployed dual stack networks, 
   others prefer not to do this as their first step in IPv6. However, 
   they currently face two urgent pressures - to compensate for an 
   immediate shortage of IPv4 addresses by deploying some method of 
   address sharing, and to prepare actively for the use of deployment of 
   IPv6 address space and services. ISPs facing only one pressure out of 
   two could adopt either CGN (for shortage of IPv6 addresses) or 6rd 
   (to provide IPv6 connectivity services). The approach described in 
   this draft is intended to address both of these pressures at the same 
   time by combining v4-v4 CGN with v6-over-v4 tunneling technologies. 

2.1. Incremental CGN Approach Overview 

   The incremental CGN approach we propose is illustrated as the 
   following figure.

    Figure 1: incremental CGN approach with IPv4 ISP network 

   DS HG = Dual-Stack Home Gateway (CPE). 

   As shown in the above figure, the ISP has not significantly changed 
   its IPv4 network. This approach enables IPv4 hosts to access the IPv4 
   Internet and IPv6 hosts to access the IPv6 Internet. A dual stack 
   host is treated as an IPv4 host when it uses IPv4 access service and 
   as an IPv6 host when it uses an IPv6 access service. In order to 
   enable IPv4 hosts to access the IPv6 Internet and IPv6 hosts to 
   access IPv4 Internet, NAT-PT [RFC2766, RFC4966] (or its replacement) 
   can be integrated with the CGN. The integration of such mechanisms is 
   out of scope for this document 

   Two new types of devices need to be deployed in this approach: a 
   dual-stack home gateway, which may follow the requirements of 
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router], and a dual-stack CGN. The dual-
   stack home gateway integrates IPv4 forwarding and v6-over-v4 
   tunneling functions. It may integrate v4-v4 NAT functionality, too. 
   The dual-stack CGN integrates v6-over-v4 tunneling and v4-v4 CGN 
   functions. 

2.2. Choice of tunneling technology 

   In principle, this model will work with any form of tunnel between 
   the DS HG and the dual-stack CGN. However, tunnels that require 
   individual configuration are clearly undesirable because of their 
   operational cost. Configured tunnels based directly on [RFC4213] are 
   therefore not suitable. A tunnel broker according to [RFC3053] would 
   also have high operational costs. 

   Modified 6RD [RFC5569, RFC5969] technology appears suitable to 
   support v6-over-v4 tunneling with low operational cost. Modified GRE

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-v6ops-incremental-cgn-02.txt     October 2010 
    

   [RFC2784] with additional auto-configuration mechanism is also 
   suitable to support v6-over-v4 tunneling. Other tunneling mechanisms 
   such as 6over4 [RFC2529], 6to4 [RFC3056], the Intra-Site Automatic 
   Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) [RFC5214] or Virtual Enterprise 
   Traversal (VET) [RFC5558] are also considered. If the ISP has an 
   entirely MPLS infrastructure between the HG and the dual-stack CGN, 
   it would also be possible to consider a 6PE [RFC4798] tunnel directly 
   over MPLS. This would, however, only be suitable for an advanced HG 
   that is unlikely to be found as a consumer device, and is not further 
   discussed here. 

2.3. Behavior of Dual-stack Home Gateway 

   When a dual-stack home gateway receives a data packet from a host, it 
   firstly checks whether the packet is IPv4 or IPv6. For IPv4 data, the 
   HG can directly forward it to CGN in the absence of v4-v4 NAT on the 
   HG. Alternatively the HG translates packet source address from a HG-
   scope private IPv4 address into a CGN-scope private IPv4 address, and 
   then forwards it towards the CGN. The HG records the v4-v4 address 
   mapping information for inbound packets, just like a normal NAT 
   gateway does. 

   For IPv6 data, the HG needs to encapsulate the data into an IPv4 
   tunnel, which has the dual-stack CGN as the other end. The HG sends 
   the new IPv4 packet towards CGN. 

   The HG records the mapping information between the tunnel and the 
   source IPv6 address for inbound packets if HG uplinks to more than 
   one CGN. Detailed considerations for the use of multiple CGNs by one 
   HG are for further study. 

2.4. Behavior of Dual-stack CGN 

   When a dual-stack CGN receives a data packet from a dual-stack home 
   gateway, it firstly checks whether the packet is a normal IPv4 packet 
   or a v6-over-v4 tunnel packet. For a normal IPv4 packet, the CGN 
   translates packet source address from a CGN-scope private IPv4 
   address into a public IPv4 address, and then send it to IPv4  
   Internet. The CGN records the v4-v4 address mapping information for 
   inbound packets, just like normal NAT does. For a v6-over-v4 tunnel 
   packet, the CGN needs to decapsulate it into the original IPv6 packet 
   and then send it to IPv6 Internet. The CGN records the mapping 
   information between the tunnel and the source IPv6 address for 
   inbound packets. 

   Depending on the deployed location of the CGN, it may use v6-over-v4 
   tunnels to connect to the IPv6 Internet.

2.5. Impact for existing hosts and unchanged networks 

   This approach does not affect the unchanged networks at all. Legacy 
   IPv4 ISP networks and their IPv4 devices remain in use. The existing 
   IPv4 hosts, shown as the right box in Figure 1, either having global 
   IPv4 addresses or behind v4-v4 NAT can connect to IPv4 Internet as it 
   is now. These hosts, if they are upgraded to become dual-stack hosts, 
   can access IPv6 Internet through the IPv4 ISP network by using IPv6-
   over-IPv4 tunnel technologies. 

2.6. IPv4/IPv6 intercommunication 

   IPv6-only public services are not expected as long as there is 
   significant IPv4-only customer base in the world, for obvious 
   commercial reasons. However, IPv4/IPv6 intercommunication may become 
   issues in many scenarios. 

   An ISP can provide its IPv6-only customers with a network-layer 
   translation service to satisfy this need. Such a service is not fully 
   defined at this time, so we refer to it non-specifically as "NAT64". 
   Current work in the IETF is focused on one particular proposal  
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]. The NAT64 service can be 
   provided as a common service located at the border between the ISP 
   and the IPv4 Internet, beyond the dual stack CGN from the customer's 
   viewpoint. It may be integrated into CGN devices too. 

   [I-D.boucadair-dslite-interco-v4v6] describes a proposal to enhance a 
   DS-lite solution with an additional feature to ease interconnection 
   between IPv4 and IPv6 realms. Home users may encounter the problem of 
   reaching legacy IPv4-only public services from IPv6-only clients. 
   This problem already exists in early phases, but will become more 
   serious over time. 

2.7. Discussion 

   For IPv4 traffic, the incremental CGN approach inherits all the 
   problems of CGN address sharing techniques 
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues] (e.g., scaling, and the 
   difficulty of supporting well-known ports for inbound traffic). 
   Application layer problems created by double NAT are for further 
   study. 

   If a different technology than v4-v4 NAT is chosen for IPv4 address 
   sharing, for example [I-D.ymbk-aplusp], the present approach could be 
   suitably modified, for example replacing the v4-v4 NAT function by 
   the A+P gateway function. 

 
 
Jiang, et al.          Expires April 12, 2011                 [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-v6ops-incremental-cgn-02.txt     October 2010 
    

   For IPv6 traffic, a user behind the DS HG will see normal IPv6 
   service. We observe that an IPv6 tunnel MTU of at least 1500 bytes 
   would ensure that the mechanism does not cause excessive 
   fragmentation of IPv6 traffic nor excessive IPv6 path MTU discovery 
   interactions. 

   For IPv6 traffic, a user behind the DS HG will see normal IPv6 
   service. This, and the absence of NAT problems for IPv6, will create 
   an incentive for users and application service providers to prefer 
   IPv6. 

   ICMP filtering [RFC4890] function may be included as part of CGN 
   functions. 

3. Smooth transition towards IPv6 infrastructure 

   The incremental CGN approach can easily be transited from NAT444 CGN 
   or 6rd. NAT444 CGN solves the public address shortage issues in the 
   current IPv4 infrastructure. However, it does not contribute towards 
   IPv6 deployment at all. The incremental CGN approach can inherit 
   NAT444 CGN function while providing overlay IPv6 services. 6rd 
   mechanisms can also transform into this incremental CGN with small 
   modifications. One consideration is that home gateways also have to 
   be changed correspondently. 

   The incremental CGN can also easily be transited into IPv6-enabled 
   infrastructure, in which the ISP network is either dual-stack or 
   IPv6-only. For dual-stack ISP networks, dual-stack home gateways can 
   simply switch off the v6-over-v4 function and forward both IPv6 and 
   IPv4 traffic directly while the dual-stack CGN only keeps its v4-v4 
   NAT function. This approach is considered an unlikely choice, since 
   we expect ISPs to choose the approach described as incremental CGN 
   here because they want to avoid or are unable to complete dual-stack 
   deployment completely. For IPv6-only ISP networks, the DS-Lite 
   solution also needs dual-stack home gateway and CGN devices. 

    

   The best model for the incremental CGN approach is that an integrated 
   configurable CGN device and an adaptive HG device. The integrated CGN 
   hardware may integrate multiple functions, include NAT444 CGN, 6rd 
   router, incremental CGN, DS-Lite CGN and dual-stack forwarding. The 
   HG has to integrate these correspondent functions, and be able to 
   detect changes on the CGN side. 

   For example, the appearance of IPv6 Route Advertisement messages or 
   DHCPv6 messages can be used as a signal the availability of DS-Lite 
 
 
Jiang, et al.          Expires April 12, 2011                 [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-v6ops-incremental-cgn-02.txt     October 2010 
    

   CGN. When an ISP decides to switch from incremental CGN to DS-Lite 
   CGN, it may be that only a configuration change or a minor software 
   update is needed on the CGNs. The home gateway can then detect this 
   change and switch automatically to DS-Lite mode. The only impact on 
   the home user will be to receive a different IPv6 prefix. 

   In the smooth transition model, both CGN and HG are re-usable devices 
   during different transition periods. It avoids the potential multiple 
   upgrades. IPv6 migration may be incrementally achieved according to 
   the real user requirements. 

4. Security Considerations 

   Security issues associated with NAT have been documented in [RFC2663] 
   and [RFC2993]. 

   Further security analysis will be needed to understand double NAT 
   security issues and tunnel security issues. However, since the tunnel 
   proposed here exists entirely within a single ISP network, between 
   the HG/CPE and the CGN, the threat model is relatively simple. 
   [RFC4891] describes how to protect tunnels using IPSec, but it is not 
   clear whether doing so would be an important requirement. An ISP 
   could deem its infrastructure to provide adequate security without 
   additional protection of the tunnels. 

   The dual-stack home gateway will need to provide basic security 
   functionality for IPv6 [I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-simple-security]. Other 
   aspects are described in [RFC4864]. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   This draft does not request any IANA action.
