     Abstract 

        This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
        Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
        protocols in the Internet Community.  In particular, it defines
        objects used for the management of Dynamic Host Configuration
        Protocol Relay Agent for IPv4 and Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
        Relay Agent.

     1. Introduction 

        This memo is a product of the DHCP Working Group and
        defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
        for use with network management protocols in the Internet
        community.  In particular, it describes a set of extensions
        that DHCPv4 Relay and Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) Relay Agent

        implement. Many implementations support both DHCP and BOOTP
        within a single server and hence this memo describes the
        relay agent MIB for both the protocol.

      
        This memo is based on the Internet-standard Network Management 
        Framework as defined by documents [RFC2578, RFC2579, RFC2580]. 

        Objects defined in this MIB allow access to and control of DHCP
        Relay Software.  
        
        The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL,"
        "SHALL NOT," "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED,"  "MAY,"
        and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in [RFC2119].

     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe
        the current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please
        refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410], Managed objects are
        accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management
        Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally accessed
        through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
        Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
        in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo
        specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is
        described in STD 58, [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58,
        [RFC2580].


     3. Overview 

        In the tradition of the Simple Network Management Protocol
        (SNMP), the minimum number of objects possible is defined in
        this MIB, while still providing as rich a set of management
        information as possible.  An object is left out of this MIB
        when it can be derived from other objects that are provided.
        Further to the tradition of the SNMP, computationally intense
        operations are left to the domain of the management station.
        Thus, this MIB provides a set of objects from which other
        management information may be derived.


     3.1. Relationship to Other MIBs 


     3.1.1. DHCP MIB Extensions 

        The DHCP MIB extensions will be the "dhcp" branch of the standard 
        MIB-2 tree, as illustrated by the following diagram:

     5. Intellectual Property 

        The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of
        any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed
        to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology
        described in this document or the extent to which any license
        under such rights might or might not be available; neither
        does it represent that it has made any effort to identify
        any such rights.  Information on the IETF's procedures with
        respect to rights in standards-track and standards-related
        documentation can be found in BCP-11.

        Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and
        any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result
        of an attempt made to obtain a general license or permission
        for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or
        users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF
        Secretariat.

        The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its
        attention any copyrights, patents or patent applications,
        or other proprietary rights that may cover technology that
        may be required to practice this standard.  Please address
        the information to the IETF Executive Director.


     6. IANA Considerations 

        IANA must fill in the value of the RFC number when it is
        assigned to this memo.  It is represented as "xxxx" in the
        DESCRIPTION section of MODULE-IDENTITY.

     7. Security Considerations

	This MIB includes few objects that have MAX-ACCESS
	clause of read-write or read-create.  The support for
	SET operations in a non-secure environment without
	proper protection can have a negative effect on network
	operations.

        It is thus important to control SET access to these objects
        and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when
        sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of
        SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate
        security.  Even if the network itself is secure (for example
        by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who
        on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET

        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

        It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410],
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).

        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is
        NOT RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy
        SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.  It is then a
        customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
        entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module
        is properly configured to give access to the objects only
        to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to
        indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
