             Maximally Redundant Trees in Segment Routing 
             draft-agv-rtgwg-spring-segment-routing-mrt-00


Abstract

      This document presents a Fast Reroute (FRR) approach aimed at   
   providing link and node protection of node and adjacency segments  
   within the Segment Routing (SR) framework.  This FRR behavior builds
   on Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT) FRR algorithm [I-D.atlas-rtgwg-
   mrt-mc-arch].

      Fast-Reroute with Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT-FRR) using
   Segment routing is a technology that gives link-protection and node-
   protection with 100% coverage in any network topology that is still
   connected after the failure. MRT is computational efficient. For any
   router in the network, the MRT computation is less than the LFA
   computation for a node with three or more neighbors in SR domain (Ex:
   Topology Independent Fast Reroute).

INTERNET DRAFT           MRT in Segment Routing          October 9, 2015


1  Introduction

      SR MRT FRR is one among the local repair mechanisms for Segment
   routing network. Another well known local repair mechanism for SR is
   Topology Independent Fast Reroute which is also capable of restoring
   end-to-end connectivity in case of a failure of a link or a node,
   with guaranteed coverage properties. MRT also provides 100% network
   failure coverage. The advantage of MRT over TI-LFA would be the
   computation complexities involved in MRT is much lesser then TI-LFA.
   MRT is best suited for access/aggregate ring network or low end
   devices which has low computing capacity.

1.1 Standard Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2. Draft Specific Terminology

   For ease of reading, some of the terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-
   rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] is repeated here.

   Redundant Trees (RT):   A pair of trees where the path from any node
   X to the root R along the first tree is node-disjoint with the path
   from the same node X to the root along the second tree. These can be
   computed in 2-connected graphs.

   Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT):   A pair of trees where the path
   from any node X to the root R along the first tree and the path from
   the same node X to the root along the second tree share the minimum
   number of nodes and the minimum number of links. Each such shared
   node is a cut-vertex.  Any shared links are cut-links. Any RT is an
   MRT but many MRTs are not RTs.  The two MRTs are referred to as MRT-
   Blue and MRT-Red.

   MRT-Red:   MRT-Red is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it is
   used to described the associated forwarding topology and MT-ID.
   Specifically, MRT-Red is the decreasing MRT where links in the GADAG
   are taken in the direction from a higher topologically ordered node
   to a lower one.

   MRT-Blue:   MRT-Blue is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it is
   used to described the associated forwarding topology and MT-ID.
   Specifically, MRT-Blue is the increasing MRT where links in the GADAG
   are taken in the direction from a lower topologically ordered node to
   a higher one.

   Rainbow MRT MT-ID:   It is useful to have an MT-ID that refers to the
   multiple MRT topologies and to the default topology.  This is
   referred to as the Rainbow MRT MT-ID and is used by LDP to reduce
   signaling and permit the same label to always be advertised to all
   peers for the same (MT-ID, Prefix).

   MRT Island:   From the computing router, the set of routers that
   support a particular MRT profile and are connected via MRT- eligible
   links.

   Island Border Router (IBR):   A router in the MRT Island that is
   connected to a router not in the MRT Island and both routers are in a
   common area or level.

   Island Neighbor (IN):   A router that is not in the MRT Island but is
   adjacent to an IBR and in the same area/level as the IBR..

3. Overview of SR Signaling for MRT

      To extend MRT support to Segment routing following requirement
   need to be achieved : 

   1.  SR MRT Capabilities must be advertised using IGP extension for SR
   MRT.  Also SR MRT capabilities must be in sync with IGP specific MRT
   capabilities advertisement. If the peer has not advertised the SR MRT
   capability, then it indicates that LSR does not support MRT
   procedures.

   2.  As specified in MRT Architecture draft-ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-
   architecture, both Option 1A and Option 1B can be used for the
   implementation of SR MRT.

   For Option 1A, two additional Prefix SID's/Label for RED and BLUE MT
   must be advertised in addition to default prefix SID/Label. The IGP
   extension carrying prefix SID for RED and BLUE MT must have
   corresponding MT-ID allocated by IANA for default MRT profile.

   For Option 1B, Global Unique Context SID/Label for Red & Blue as
   topology identifier must be used.  

4. Protecting segments

   In this section, we explain how a protecting router processes the
   label stack of a packet upon the failure of its interface.

   The behavior depends on the type of top segment in SR label stack to
   be protected. Its assumed the MRT algorithm is run prior to interface
   failure and alternate is selected as per the algorithm. The alternate
   segment could be MRT-RED label or MRT Blue label of Next/Next-to-Next
   Hop depending on the scenario.


4.1. The top segment is a node segment The current SR Label Stack is
   kept intact. The alternate segment is pushed at the top of SR label
   stack and continue forwarding the packet as per updated label stack.

4.1. The top segment is an adjacency segment The top adjacency label in
   the SR label stack representing the failed interface is popped & the
   alternate segment is pushed at the top of SR Label stack and contineu
   forwarding the packet as per updated label stack.
