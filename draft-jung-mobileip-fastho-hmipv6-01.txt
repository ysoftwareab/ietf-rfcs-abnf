 Abstract 
  
    This document addresses Fast Handover over HMIPv6 networks. A simple 
    integration of FMIPv6 with HMIPv6 may induce unnecessary processing 
    overhead for re-tunneling at the previous Access Router and 
    inefficient usage of network bandwidth. This document describes the 
    Fast Handover for HMIPv6 (F-HMIPv6), which is designed to be friendly 
    with the data transport feature of HMIPv6. In F-HMIPv6, the Mobile 
    Nodes inform the MAP about its movement anticipation and thus the bi-
    directional tunnels for fast handover are established between MAP and 
    NAR, not between PAR and NAR. The F-HMIPv6 scheme utilizes the 
    existing FMIPv6 messages, without defining any new control messages.

 INTERNET DRAFT         Fast Handover for HMIPv6              June 2003 
  
 1. Introduction 
     
    The Hierarchical MIPv6 (HMIPv6) facilitates to reduce the delay 
    concerned with the location update, in which an MN sends a local 
    Binding Updates (BU) to the local MAP, rather than the Home Agent and 
    Correspondent Nodes that are typically further away. On the other 
    hand, the Fast Handover for MIPv6 (FMIPv6) uses L2 signals for 
    earlier movement detection and configuration of a new CoA for the new 
    access router in advance, so as to minimize the disruption of 
    services during handover. Both the FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 schemes have 
    been developed to reduce the handover latency in their own ways. This 
    document aims at finding a proper combination of those two schemes to 
    provide better handover performance. 
     
    This document addresses Fast Handover over HMIPv6 networks in terms 
    of data flows and control operations. At a glance, it may be 
    straightforward to simply integrate the FMIPv6 scheme with HMIPv6. 
    However, such simple integration may induce unnecessary processing 
    overhead for re-tunneling at the previous Access Routers and also 
    inefficient usage of network bandwidth. The main reason for this is 
    that the data transport of HMIPv6 is based on the tunneling from the 
    MAP to MNs not ARs, while the FMIPv6 uses the tunneling between the 
    previous and new Access Routers for fast handover.  
     
    This document describes Fast Handover scheme for HMIPv6 (F-HMIPv6), 
    in which a bi-directional tunnels for fast handover is established 
    between MAP and NAR, not between PAR and NAR. For this purpose, the 
    Fast BU (FBU) message is sent to MAP, not PAR, by MN. In addition, we 
    discuss further enhancements of F-HMIPv6 by considering the data 
    transport feature of HMIPv6, which include the tunnel extension from 
    MAP to MN, not NAR, and the bicasting of MAP. The F-HMIPv6 utilizes 
    the well-defined FMIPv6 messages, without defining any new messages.  
  
  
 2. Terminology 
  
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2]. 
     
    This document uses all the terminology described in the MIPv6 [3], 
    HMIPv6 [4], and FMIPv6 [5] documents. In addition, this document uses 
    the following terms for the on-link Care of Address (LCoA): 
     
    PLCoA: MN's LCoA valid on the Previous Access Router (PAR). It 
          corresponds to the PCoA of the FMIPv6. 
     
    NLCoA: MN's LCoA valid on the New Access Router (NAR). It corresponds 
          to the NCoA of the FMIPv6.

 3. Data Flows by F-HMIPv6 
  
    Figure 1 illustrates a reference configuration for fast handover in 
    HMIPv6 networks. In the figure, the MAP acts as an aggregation router 
    in the hierarchical domain. In the domain, a mobile node (MN) moves 
    from the previous AR (PAR) region into the new AR (NAR) region, and 
    the corresponding LCoA will change from PLCoA to NLCoA.

    A natural choice for fast handover in HMIPv6 networks may be to apply 
    the existing FMIPv6 scheme over the HMIPv6 networks. In this case, a 
    bi-directional tunnel will be established between PAR and NAR by the 
    FMIPv6 procedures. 
     
    However, it is noted that such simple integration of FMIPv6 with 
    HMIPv6 may possibly induce additional processing overhead for re-
    tunneling at PAR and also inefficient usage of network bandwidth.

    Figure 2 shows the data flow by the simple integration of FMIPv6 with 
    HMIPv6. According to the HMIPv6 operations, the data packets sent by 
    CN will arrive at MAP and then be tunneled to MN over PLCoA.

      Figure 2: Data flows by simple integration of FMIPv6 with HMIPv6  
     
     
    When the handover is initiated, a bi-directional tunnel will be 
    established between PAR and NAR according to the FMIPv6 procedures. 
    To forward the data packets to the NAR by using the tunnel, the PAR 
    must first intercept those data packets flowing from the MAP, and 
    then perform the re-tunneling process. This may be done by adding a 
    new outer IP header of <Source = PAR, Destination = NAR> to the data 
    packets sent by MAP according to the HMIPv6 operations.  
     
    In the viewpoint of the HMIPv6 operations, the above approach has the 
    following disadvantages: 
     
    (1) The PAR must perform the tunneling operations for fast handover, 
       in addition to the HMIPv6 tunneling from MAP to MN. To do this, 
       the PAR must first intercept the data packets flowing from the 
       MAP, which will be an additional overhead for HMIPv6. It is noted 
       that the data delivery in HMIPv6 is performed based on MAP. 
     
    (2) In HMIPv6, the actual data path of the bi-directional tunnel 
       between PAR and NAR may include the MAP (i.e., PAR-MAP-NAR). 
       Accordingly, the data packets will flow twice along the path 
       between PAR and MAP. This induces inefficiency of network 
       bandwidth usage, especially when ARs are connected to the network 
       through bandwidth-limited links.   
     
    (3) From such detouring feature, the overall handover latency may 
       possibly increase during the handover period.

    From the observations described above, it is clear that the fast 
    handover for HMIPv6 needs to be designed by considering the data 
    transport features of the HMIPv6 (i.e., in HMIPv6, all data packets 
    are intercepted by MAP and delivered over the tunnel between MAP and 
    MNs). 
     
    This document describes the scheme of Fast Handover for HMIPv6 (F-
    HMIPv6), in which the MAP performs the tunneling for fast handover 
    instead of the PAR. By the F-HMIPv6 scheme, the data packets sent by 
    CN will be tunneled by the MAP toward the NAR during the handover. 
     
    Figure 3 illustrates the data flows by the F-HMIPv6.

                    Figure 3: Data flows by F-HMIPv6  
     
  
    Before handover, according to the HMIPv6 operations, the data packets 
    sent by CN are tunneled by MAP to MN with the following IP fields: 
     
     o Inner IP header: <Source = CN, Destination = RCoA of MN> 
     o Outer IP header: <Source = MAP, Destination = PLCoA of MN> 
     
    When the F-HMIPv6 handover is triggered (e.g., by receiving the FBU 
    message from the MN), the MAP will establish a bi-directional tunnel 
    with the NAR, and then begin to forward the data packets to the NAR 
    over the tunnel. By the tunnel, each data packet has an additional 
    outer IP header to the normal HMIPv6 headers with the following IP 
    fields: 
     
     o Additional outer IP header: <S = MAP, Destination = NAR> 
     
    When receiving the tunneled data packets from the MAP, the NAR will 
    de-capsulate them and then be caching the de-capsulated data packets. 
    When the MN moves into the NAR region, the NAR will deliver the 
    cached data packets to the MN, as done in FMIPv6.

 4. Generic Operations for F-HMIPv6 
  
    Figure 4 illustrates the generic procedures for F-HMIPv6 operations. 
    The control messages for F-HMIPv6 are identical to those for FMIPv6, 
    except for the source/destination addresses of IP fields. The 
    Correspondent Node (CN) and Home Agent (HA) operations will not be 
    affected.

                      Figure 4: F-HMIPv6 Control Flows 
     
     
    Basically, the F-HMIPv6 procedures are based on the assumption that 
    each AR has already the necessary information of its neighboring ARs 
    such as the link-layer address and network prefix of the concerned AR. 
     
    In addition, the control flows of Figure 4 are derived under the 
    following conditions:

     a) The handover is initiated by MN (mobile-initiated HO). 
      
     b) The MN can anticipate the handover (anticipated HO). 
      
     c) The tunnel for HO is established between MAP and NAR. 
      
     d) DAD optimization (like optimistic DAD) is not supported. 
     
    A more detailed description for each control flow of F-HMIPv6 is 
    given below: 
     
      1) Based on L2 handover anticipation, the MN sends RtSolPr message 
         to PAR. The RtSolPr SHOULD include information about the link 
         layer addresses of the MN and the NAR concerned. 
     
      2) In response to the RtSolPr message, the MAP sends the PrRtAdv 
         message to the MN, which SHOULD contain information about the 
         NLCoA for the MN to use in the NAR region.  
  
         It is assumed that the NAR already knows the network prefix and 
         link layer address of all the neighboring NARs. 
          
         The NLCoA can be auto-configured using the network prefix of 
         NAR and the link layer address of MN by PAR. In a certain case, 
         the NLCoA may be allocated by a stateful address management 
         scheme. 
     
      3) The MN sends Fast Binding Update (FBU) message to MAP. The FBU 
         message contains PLCoA and IP address of the NAR. 
     
      4) After receiving the FBU message from MN, the MAP will send a 
         Handover Initiate (HI) message to the NAR so as to establish a 
         bi-directional tunnel.  
     
      5) In response to the HI message, the NAR will set up a host route 
         entry for the MN's PLCoA and then respond with a Handover 
         Acknowledge (HACK) message.  
        
         As a result, a bi-directional tunnel between MAP and NAR will 
         be established. Over the tunnel, the data packets sent by MAP 
         have the additional outer IP header with the following IP 
         fields of <Source = MAP, Destination = NAR>. The NAR may cache 
         those data packets flowing from the MAP, until it receives the 
         RS (with FNA option) message from the newly incoming MN.  
  
      6) The MAP sends Fast Binding ACK (FBACK) messages toward the MN 
         over PLCoA and NLCoA. 
     


  
  
 Jung, Koh, Lee, Soliman, El-Malki                             [Page 8] 
 INTERNET DRAFT         Fast Handover for HMIPv6              June 2003 
  
         Then, the MAP will begin to forward the data packets destined 
         to MN to the NAR by using the established tunnel. 
     
      7) The MN exchanges the RS and RA messages with NAR, when it 
         detects that it is moved in the link layer, and receives the 
         responding RA from the NAR. 
          
         Then the NAR delivers the buffered data packets to the MN over 
         NLCoA. 
          
      8) The MN then follows the normal HMIPv6 operations by sending a 
         Local BU to MAP, as done in HMIPv6. 
     
         The MAP will clear the tunnel for fast handover, when it 
         receives the new Local Binding Update with NLCoA from the MN. 
     
     
 5. Variants of F-HMIPv6 
     
 5.1 Network-initiated Handover 
     
    The generic procedures described in Figure 4 correspond to the case 
    of the mobile-initiated handover. In the network-initiated HO case, 
    the RtSolPr will be omitted. In this case, after detecting that the 
    MN is moving toward the NAR, the PAR will send an unsolicited RA 
    message to the MN, which MUST include the NLCoA for the MN to use in 
    the NAR region. 
     
     
 5.2 No Anticipation 
     
    When the handover anticipation cannot be supported, the F-HMIPv6 will 
    follow the normal HMIPv6 operation. The MN just sends the Local BU to 
    the MAP. In fact, the fast handover cannot be supported. 
     
     
 6. Messages for F-HMIPv6  
     
    The F-HMIPv6 is designed to exploit all the messages defined in 
    FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 with the following exceptions: 
     
    - A new flag is defined in the HMIPv6 MAP option, so as to indicate 
     whether the MAP supports the F-HMIPv6 or not within the HMIPv6 
     domain.  
     
    - Some of the FMIPv6 messages have different IP source and 
     destination addresses in the respective IP fields. In particular, 
     the MAP address is used instead of the PAR address.

    The different usage and format of those control messages will be 
    identified and specified, as the FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 mechanisms are 
    changed. 
     
     
 6.1 A New Flag in the HMIPv6 MAP Option 
     
    When a MN moves into a new MAP domain, it receives the Router 
    Advertisement with a MAP option from an access router. When the F bit 
    set in the MAP option indicates that the mobile node MAY use F-HMIPv6. 
    If the MN is not aware of F-HMIPv6, or the F bit is not set, it 
    SHOULD NOT use F-HMIPv6.

 6.2 Use of FMIPv6 messages 
     
    F-HMIPv6 uses the messages for fast handover defined in FMIPv6, with 
    different source and destination IP addresses. Table 1 summarizes the 
    use of these messages.

 7. Enhancement of F-HMIPv6 Operations 
  
    In this section, we describe the enhance scenarios for F-HMIPv6, with 
    the help of additional techniques such as a stateful LCoA management 
    scheme and/or a bicasting of MAP by simultaneous binding. 
     
     
 7.1 F-HMIPv6 with Tunnel Extension to MN 
     
    In F-HMIPv6, the bi-directional tunnel from MAP to NAR could be 
    replaced with the tunnel between MAP and MN, as done in the normal 
    HMIPv6. 
     
    For this purpose, the HI/HACK messages need to be eliminated in the 
    F-HMIPv6 with the help of an appropriate DAD optimization or LCoA 
    configuration scheme to ensure that the NLCoA confirmation (via the 
    DAD process) is not needed in the NAR.  
     
    Such the configuration schemes MAY be implemented by using the 
    Optimistic DAD [6], Advance DAD [7]. In addition to these schemes, 
    the other LCoA configuration and allocation schemes (e.g., enhanced 
    DHCPv6) MAY be used, where the pre-configured globally unique LCoAs 
    will be managed between PAR and NARs via the DHCPv6 server.

 INTERNET DRAFT         Fast Handover for HMIPv6              June 2003 
  
    If the tunnel extension to MN is used along with an appropriated LCoA 
    management scheme, the HI/HACK messages and the bi-directional tunnel 
    between MAP and NAR could be eliminated.  
     
    Furthermore, the Local BU (LBU) message of HMIPv6 will also be able 
    to replace the FBU message. That is, the MN does not need to send the 
    FBU message to MAP. Instead, the MN sends the LBU to the MAP directly.  
     
    As a result, Figure 4 could be changed as Figure 6

               Figure 6: F-HMIPv6 with Tunnel to MN  
     
     
     
    As shown in the figure, as soon as the MAP receives the FBU from the 
    MN, it begins to communicate with MN over NLCoA. 
     
     
 7.2 F-HMIPv6 with Bicasting  
  
    It is noted that the bicasting along with simultaneous binding [8] 
    can be used to enhance the handover performance, in particular, for 
    addressing the ping-pong effect. In F-HMIPv6, it is strongly 
    recommended that the bicasting be used for stable handover, when 
    anticipation is used. 
     
    In addition to the scenario described in the preceding section, the 
    bicasting is applied along with simultaneous binding in F-HMIPv6, as 
    shown in Figure 7. Note in this case that the LBU/LBACK messages are 
    used to indicate when the MAP stops the bicasting.

                      Figure 7: F-HMIPv6 with Bicasting 
     
     
    In F-HMIPv6, if the bicasting is enabled, when the packet forwarding 
    to the NAR is indicated, the MAP will also continue to send the data 
    packets to the MN (over PLCoA). That is, after transmitting the FBACK 
    messages, the MAP will send the data packets destined to MN toward 
    the NAR over the established tunnel as well as the MN over the PLCoA. 
     
    The packet forwarding to the MN over PLCoA will stop, when the MAP 
    receives a new Local Binding Update (by HMIPv6) from the MN that has 
    moved into the NAR. 
     
  
 8. Security Considerations  
    
    The security issues on F-HMIPv6 are basically the same with those on 
    FMIPv6 and HMIPv6.  
     
    Noting that the MN and the MAP could have an IPsec SA in the HMIPv6, 
    the PrRtSol and PrRtAdv messages can be protected with IPsec. This 
    feature actually provides an advantage over FMIPv6 where ND messages 
    cannot be secured in its present form.

    In addition, the MAP MUST ensure that the RtSolPr and FBU packets 
    arrived from an MN that legitimately owns the RCoA. Otherwise, a 
    bogus node could attempt to disrupt packets meant for the MN and 
    redirect them to some access router.  
     
    Further Security issues will be identified, as the F-HMIPv6 work is 
    progressing.
