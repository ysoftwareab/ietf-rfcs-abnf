Abstract

   In the current Internet, a site is often secured by firewall, which
   filters bogus traffic from outside at the border of the site.  This
   'Border Defense Model', however, has lots of potential security
   issues, and also prevents a deployment of next-generation Internet
   applications and services.

   This memo surveys the security issues of the Border Defense Model',
   and proposes a network architecture 'Quarantine Model', to prevent
   that security issues and promote a deployment of the next-generation
   Internet.

Internet-Draft         Quarantine Model Overview           February 2004


   In our 'Quarantine Model', nodes are connected to separate networks
   according to their security level. And a different security policy is
   implemented on each network using the multiple security-related
   techniques, such as filtering, authentication, and encryption. This
   'devide and conquer' framework provides more flexible and better
   network security to 'Quarantine Model'.

   This memo enumerates requirements and consideration issues for this
   architecture. It is, however, beyond the scope of this document to
   propose a specific implementation or protocol.

Internet-Draft         Quarantine Model Overview           February 2004


1. Introduction

   A network site is often secured by firewall, which prevents network
   attackings from outside, such as virus, worm, or DoS. To block these
   kind of attackings, firewall divides internal network and external
   network at the border security point (e.g. the edge of the network
   site). At this point, firewall blocks or allows the incoming traffic
   based on the security policy of the site.

   However, this 'Border Defense Model' is insufficient. 'Border Defense
   Model' assumes there is no security issue inside network site. This
   assumption is no longer true now; virus or worm can infect PCs
   through firewall (like NIMDA or MS-Blaster), or users can connect
   their PCs infected outside the network site. This fact means 'Border
   Defense Model', like firewall, does not completely secure the network
   site.

   In addition to the above weakness, 'Border Defense Model' is an
   obstacle for the deployment of new network protocols and
   technologies. As a result of trade-off between security and
   convenience, a site security policy become very restricted and gives
   limited connectivity to customers (e.g. only to a HTTP port).
   Especially for IPv6 network, it is too ristrictive to make a
   end-to-end connection over the security border point. The network
   node cannot easily talk each other over firewall even it has global
   unicast IP addresses. Additionally, it seldomly coexists with new
   network protocol and services such as multimedia services, QoS,
   multicasting, P2P application protocols etc. Therefore, 'Quarantine
   Model' is required to give more transparent security approach than
   border defense model for IPv6 network.

   This memo propose a 'Quarantine Model' , to solve the two issues
   mentioned above. It designs to collaborate with existing security
   technologies to provide more flexible and better network security
   architecture. It is not conflict existing security technologies and
   not exclusive model of 'Border Defense Model'.

   This memo contains following sections.

      In Section 2, describes the issues of current border defense model
      and the requirements for the next-generation Internet.

      Section 3 describes the overview and the basic concept of
      'Quarantine Model', and the remaining section explains a
      deployment model, components, procedures, ToDos, and the security
      issues of this model.

2. Issues in border defense model

   There are two issues in Border Defense Model: technical one and
   operational one. The former one is brought about by the nature of
   protocols or implementations, such as handling of encrypted session
   or scanning speed. The later one is the issue owing to the
   administrative requirement or customer's request.

2.1 Technical issues of border defense model

2.1.1 Traffic volume and full packet inspection

   In Border Defense Model, firewall has to scan all the connections and
   packets, since it cannot detect recent viruses and worms which spread
   over the Internet via some well-known open port (e.g. HTTP, SMTP).

   Furthermore, the amount of the network traffic between the Internet
   and a network site has been increasing, because of the deployment of
   high-speed network intrastructure and applications consuming
   bandwidth.

   Considering these two trends, firewall at the security border point
   will become a bottleneck of a network site in the Border Defense
   Model.

2.1.2 Encrypted end-to-end connection

   Once encrypted session is established between internal machines of
   border defense point and outside of border, border defense point
   cannot inspect its connection and contents of data (see section 5
   of[2]).

2.1.3 Tunneling technology, VPN

   Tunneling technologies, such as VPN or RAS, are often used to provide
   an intranet connectivity to outside the site. Although they are
   conveniently provide such services, they still have some security
   holes, because it is difficult for firewalls to inspect the contents
   encapsulated in tunnels.

   o  Users can create tunnels against the administrator's will. (e.g.
      XXX over HTTP)

   o  Complicatated firewall configuration can often lead to a
      misconfiguration.

   o  Administrators cannot inspect the contents within the tunnel, once
      the tunneling session is authenticated and established (see

      Section 2.1.2).


2.2 Operational issues border defense model

2.2.1 Immediate update of filtering rule against new security issues

   There was some Internet disaster case by CodeRed, NIMDA, MS Blaster,
   MyDoom worm, and they need only a few hours to spread themselves all
   over the world. This fact means that firewalls do not assist network
   administrators to extinguish viruses from their networks.

   There are two reasons for this firewall weakness. First, it is often
   quite difficult to configure the proper filtering rule to reject a
   new virus from outside. Second, virus can intrude a site even during
   the configuration of this filtering rule. These two lead to the
   collapse of the assumption of border defense model : 'There is no
   attack from inside the network'.

   To overcome this kind of security threat, some integrated mechanism
   is necessary to enforce the security fixes to nodes by automatic
   installation and checking.

2.2.2 Mobility node (Note PC) control, wireless LAN

   The biggest problem breaking down the border defense model is mobile
   node control. The mobile node such as note PC is easy to go outside
   of their security border and to connect to other network connectivity
   like home LAN, dial up connection etc. We cannot control them when it
   goes outside of the security border.

   They are facing security risk on the outside of network connectivity
   and possibility to infect network worms. There is security risk when
   those mobile node is back and plugged into the their internal
   network. Nothing enforces to check and scan those mobile nodes to
   reject virus and worms get into when it is connected back to the
   internal network. Current border defense model cannot manage well
   this critical case breaking security border.

   Wireless LAN and its connectivity bring security risk into border
   defense model. The radio wave reach to outside of building and office
   floor and any one can easily get into their network if it does not
   well securely configured.

   We must identify there is many physical back door to get into the
   internal network. Border defense point such as gateway, router is not
   only the route to get into their internal network to break border
   defense model.

2.2.3 Unmanaged network

   The Internet connectivity has been getting popular all over the world
   and it is often provided in always-on style.

   Although this has been a strong driving force for the Internet
   deployment to unmanaged network environments such as home-LAN, it
   also brings about a security threat to this environment; users in
   unmanaged network does not have enough knowledge for security
   management to protect their network, and hence they are potential
   victims for crackers.

   This is not a negligible issue for the Internet, because the number
   of such network is great and crackers can give a heavy impact or
   trouble to the Internet by DDoD using all of such networks.

2.3 Requirements of new security model for IPv6

   One of the major advantages of IPv6 is the liberation from NAT or IP
   masquerade, which leads to the use of end-to-end communication.

   This advantage is, however, inconsistent with the border defense
   model as mentioned in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2. This inconsistency
   is a hard obstacle for the deployment of IPv6, since administrators
   normally prefers border defense model to the IPv6 advantage.

   There are two reasons for this choise: the lack of the alternative
   solution without any additional security risk, and the difficulty in
   changing their security policies. To promote IPv6 and new network
   services, much better security model has to be provide to support
   end-to-end communication without degrading the security risk.

3. Architecture overview of quarantine model

   Quarantine Model is flexible security archtecture to make a security
   border as virtual network segment. It admits network nodes into
   different network segment by security level of them, and gives
   security policy for each network segments. For construction of
   'Quarantine Model', it requires below things.

   o  Security level inspection of network node

   o  Separation of network by security level

   o  Appling security policy for each separated network

   Those three things are described in following sections.

3.1 Security level inspection of network node

   The security inspection agent is required to check the security level
   of node to select the network segment based on site security policy.
   The network node need to be installed agent program to do security
   inspection to check it's security level. It checks security
   vulnerabilities conpare with security prevention information.

   o  OS and software versions

   o  Installed security patches

   o  Installed security software (e.g. anti-virus software, firewalls
      etc.)

   o  configuration and settings of software

   o  etc.


3.2 Separation of network by security level

   Quarantine model mandates a network mechanism to separate network
   users to different networks based on their security levels. You MAY
   use state-of-the-art separation technologies like 802.1x, as long as
   the network administrators can manage this separation rule. Note that
   this MAY be accomplished by the contents in packet headers (e.g. IP
   address, flow-label, port number etc), since routers/switch can
   dispatch packets to different networks according to these
   information.

Internet-Draft         Quarantine Model Overview           February 2004


3.3 Appling security policy for each separated network

   Quarantine mode applies different security policies for separate
   network segments. That security policy includes access control rules,
   routing settings etc.

   It divides the internal network to several segments  by security
   level and configures security policies for them. For untrusted
   network segment, it would be blocked the communication between other
   internal network segments and nodes, filtered specific ports and
   services. Also outgoing sessions are routed to contents scanning and
   filtering servers. On the other hand, it can configure it does not
   block any kind of communication between trusted node and trusted
   network segment. It permits outgoing and incoming connection at
   security border point for them by site security policy. It would be
   configured to accept selected port and services, allow to communicate
   specific destinations etc. for medium security leveled network
   segment.

   Applying security policy to the internal network segment and border
   defence point, quarantine model integrates and collaborates with
   other existing border defense products and tools (e.g. switch router,
   firewall etc.).

4. Advantage of quarantine security model

   This model is designed to help border defense model to solve existing
   issues that is described in previous sections. The key concept is
   that it separates trusted node traffic and untrusted traffic and
   focus on untrusted connection filtering and scanning. It reduces the
   target traffic to scan and filter on the border defense point. It
   solves the issue of Section 2.1.1.

   For encrypted end-to-end connection issues, it guarantees security
   level of the network node in the quarantine authentication process.
   We can configure to block encrypted connection on quarantine path. It
   still cannot scan session contents and packets, but it reduces
   possibility that virus and worms infected node generates attacking
   packet and sends it on the encrypted connection path. It solves
   existing problems of border defence model (e.g. Section 2.1.2,
   Section 2.1.3).

   It enforces to apply security patch or secure configuration to
   internal network node to protect attacking from the internal network
   node. In the previous network worm case like CodeRed and NIMDA, it
   uses known security hole and it is already reported several month ago
   before those worms coming to the world. It means if we can manage
   security issues well for all internal network nodes, we can block
   most of network worm attacks. It is more better solution to solve
   those security threats (e.g. Section 2.2.1, Section 2.2.2, Section
   2.2.3) than border defence model.

   It gives transparent connectivity for trusted node .  From the
   network node and application point of views, it is more flexible to
   have conductivity to outside of network and no restriction by
   security border point. Also, the accessibility of trusted node
   depends on site security policy configuration. Once it authenticated
   by quarantine authentication server and certificate that node is
   qualified as the site security policy, it can have more transparent
   accessibilities from/to the outside of network. It is affinity for
   IPv6 network (e.g. Section 2.3).

5. Deployment model

   This section describes two typical concept models of quarantine
   security model deployment. The component of quarantine model and
   quarantine procedure is described in following Section 6 and Section
   7.

5.1 Basic deployment model

   First one is typical deployment model such as enterprise or
   organization sites. In this model, it has contents scanning and
   filtering servers. It routes untrusted sessions to that quarantine
   path for security scanning. The internal network segments by security
   level are separated by swich/router from other virtual network
   segment by site security policy settings.

5.2 Deployment model for consumer segment

   Second case is consumer and home user environment and ISP services.

   In this case, contents scanning and filtering servers are in ISP
   facilities and NAC controls router/switch of subscriber end point. It
   can isolate the customer's traffic which send out network worm and
   attacking packet and vulnerable node from trusted and secure customer
   area from attacking and DoS packet, network virus outbreak to protect
   and block consuming bandwidth.

Internet-Draft         Quarantine Model Overview           February 2004


6. Components of quarantine model

   There are basic component set of quarantine model for any kind of
   deployment model.

6.1 Prevention information server

   Prevention information server(PIS) stores prevention information
   about security holes and vulnerability reports. All known security
   threat information and prevention information about security attacks
   and risks are stored in the PIS network. The PIS network is
   configured as tree structure to get prevention information from upper
   layer PIS if it does not have requested prevention information in the
   site local PIS.

   The site local PIS is optional component in this model. ISP or
   security vender may provides PIS for end users as a service /
   business.

6.2 Quarantine inspection agent

   Quarantine inspection agent(QIA) do inspection in installed machine
   and create quarantine certificate profile, and then send the profile
   information to quarantine authentication server. It corrects
   information about installed software and OS versions and
   configurations etc. to check with prevention information on the
   quarantine authentication server.

6.3 Quarantine authentication server

   Quarantine authentication server(QAS) checks profiles which are sent
   from inspection agent. It queries PIS and check the profile
   information with prevention infromation and identifies their security
   level by site security policy.

   Based on the security level, it rejects the network node to connect
   into the internal network or select one of the network segment to
   admit.

6.4 Quarantine certificate profile

   This is quarantine inspection result. It is generated by QIA and sent
   to QAS to check security level of the node.

6.5 Prevention information

   This information inludes the security hole and vulnerability
   information about specific version of software OS or hardware. It

Internet-Draft         Quarantine Model Overview           February 2004


   will have security level, assessment of damage impact, disaster
   analysis etc. to use by QAS to predict how much that security threat
   is critical.

6.6 Site security policy configuration

   The site security policy describes the security policy of network. It
   defines network segments and connectivity of them. Additionally, it
   configures requirement of security level of nodes which connect into
   the network, actions and scripts when it does not satisfy security
   conditions.

6.7 Network admission controller

   It works with existing systems, tools and frameworks to make a
   network segment in the internal network by security levels. It avoid
   target node from secure network segment and move into other network
   segment (e.g. quarantined network segment) by existing technics such
   as changing IP address, VLAN port control, routing etc.

7. Quarantine procedure

   Quarantine procedure is processed following steps.

7.1 Connecting to network

   When does network node connect to the internal network facility and
   it is up linked, QAS requests inspection and profile information to
   them. At this moment, network node is moved into the untrusted
   network segment to separate it from other network node and internal
   network segments.

7.2 Vulnerability scanning

   By a request from QAS, network node which install QIA scans itself to
   check the status of installed software version, OS version,
   configurations and generates profile information.

7.3 Profile sending

   Network node sends its profile information to QAS to check its
   security level and get authentication to connect into secure network
   segment.

7.4 Security inspection

   When QAS receives the profile information from the network node, QAS
   checks it with prevention information. It asks PIS to get prevention
   information for inspection and checks security vulnerability in the
   network node. Finally, QAS identifies security level of the network
   node.

7.5 Network admission control

   Based on security inspection result, QAS requests admission action to
   Network Admission Controller to control the network node to connect
   into the network segment. In the network admission controller, it
   controls network configuration for the router/switch or servers like
   DHCP, RADIUS, to control network node to separate and move into
   specific network segment by security level.

7.6 Profile information expiration

   When QAS gets new prevention information or update from PIS, it
   requests related network nodes to send profile information, and
   checks the profile information with latest prevention information. If
   it finds a vulnerability on profile information, it applies new
   security level for the network node and it requests to move the

   network node to other network segment if it dose not fit the security
   level of existing network segment.

8. Action items

   The status of this quarantine model is discussion and feasibility
   inspection. Here is several technical and operational issues to
   realize this quarantine model from this concept memo.  Currently,
   some vendors like Cisco [3] are designing their proprietary protocol
   and products to implement similar idea and model, but we need to have
   standard protocol, format and interoperability for this quaraine
   model. It is one of our motivation to discuss about this quarantine
   model on IETF to define related protocols and formats to be
   standardized.

8.1 Prevention information description format

   Prevention information format should be standardized. Currently,
   security vendor and authority publish security report and analysis
   report. But it is only for human readable document and it cannot
   simply integrate with any kind of system for self configuration and
   automatic corresponding. Several software vendors provide prevention
   information and configuration, rule set and signature to detect and
   block security threat for their proprietary system. It should have
   standard format to exchange those information by program to integrate
   with multi vendor system.

8.2 Profile information request protocol

   It is required to have a protocol for profile information request and
   transferring between QIA and QAS.

8.3 Profile information expiration control

   It should support profile information expiration control. When new
   security hole is found or vulnerability is reported, the system
   should enforce to quarantine inspection to all nodes again. It should
   support dynamic control of quarantine and secure node separation.

8.4 Network device entity identification

   The identifier of network device entity is one of concern. IP
   address, MAC address or any kind of information can be use to
   identify nodes, but these can dynamically change and create fake
   data. We need to have reliable and unique identification data.

8.5 Embedded system and small devices support

   It should consider to support embedded system and small devices.
   Specially for home use, it may uses those small devices and non-PC
   platform on home LAN.

Internet-Draft         Quarantine Model Overview           February 2004


   The protocol design and quarantine agent should be designed to
   support those small devices and it must be lightweight. It means it
   should not require much CPU resource and code size to integrate into
   those small platform.

   These small devices are implemented as single function and pre
   installed software into flash ROM and it does not update so often and
   not support to install new software and user customize it. Quarantine
   inspection agent and profile should handle those characteristic well.

8.6 Delivery and operations of prevention information

   Discussion point here is  who should provides prevention information.
   There are several opportunity to provide prevention information.

   o  Security vendor

   o  Software/Hardware vendor

   o  Independent security organization

   Security vendor can provides prevention information to users as
   services and business which is like as virus/worm scanning pattern
   and IDS rules, filtering signatures file. But they can not cover all
   software and hardware products and cannot correct security
   vulnerability information by themself without products vendor's help.

   It is better to have a hierarchical structure for PIS like DNS.

8.7 Confliction of prevention information

   It has a possibility to provides prevention information of security
   vulnerbility from multiple information source. It introduces conflict
   of prevention information data in PIS network.

8.8 Home network and unmanaged network

   The target network is not only for enterprise, but it should also
   care home LAN and no administrator environment. It means it should
   support some kinds of auto configuration. This is high priority of
   requirement for design and implementation of quarantine model.

8.9 NAC and integration to existing security framework

   It is very important things to integrate with existing system like
   switch, router and firewall etc. to make separation for internal
   network to quarantine area and secure area. Quarantine model itself
   does not specify how to divide two network areas into quarantine

Internet-Draft         Quarantine Model Overview           February 2004


   (untrusted node network) and secure network (trusted node network).
   NAC must support to communicate routers, switchs, firewalls to create
   virtual network segment by security level. To integrate those
   products and technologies, we should have flexible and customized
   interface on network admission controller and its configuration
   format and scripts to describe control commands.

9. Security issues

9.1 Certification of quarantine inspection agent

   We have to define an architecture that how can we trust QIA program.
   QIA should be authenticate and certificate by site security policy
   configuration. Otherwise it is easy to create fake result and there
   is no way to check reliability of quarantine inspection agent, and
   then this model would be corrupt.

9.2 Security issues of quarantine profile

   Quarantine profile information and transport way are also protected
   and secured between agent and server.

9.3 Prevention information protection

   It should have authentication check for prevention information.

9.4 Authentication and certification for prevention information server

   We have to consider about reliability of PIS. It should have a
   protocols for authentication and certificate chain of PIS.
