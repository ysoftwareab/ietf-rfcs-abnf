Abstract

   This document corrects and updates the specification of the Java
   programming language bindings of the Generic Security Services
   Application Programming Interface (GSS-API).  Specifically, the error
   code values used for GSS exceptions were incorrect in the original;
   additionally, missing numeric values of the credential usage
   constants are specified.

Internet-Draft           GSS J-Bindings Update              January 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document corrects or updates two sections of the original
   [RFC2853], section 6.3.2 for GSSCredential usage flags, and section
   6.8.1 for GSS status code values.

   The original Java bindings of the GSS-API left out the specification
   of the values of the credential usage constants.

   Additionally a transcription error resulted in misalignment of the
   major GSS status codes in sections 6.8.1 and 4.12.1.

2.  Credential Usage Constant Values

   GSS-API credentials are represented by the GSSCredential interface.
   Credentials provide the prerequisites which permit GSS-API peers to
   establish security contexts with each other.  A caller may designate
   that the credential elements which are to be applied for context
   initiation or acceptance be selected by default.

   RFC 2853 section 6.3.2 defines static constants for the GSSCredential
   usage flags used to determine how the credentials may be used to
   initiate or accept security contexts.

   The values for the INITIATE_AND_ACCEPT, INITIATE_ONLY and ACCEPT_ONLY
   constants are 0, 1 and 2, respectively:
   o  public static final int INITIATE_AND_ACCEPT = 0
         Credential usage flag requesting that it be able to be used for
         both context initiation and acceptance.
   o  public static final int INITIATE_ONLY = 1
         Credential usage flag requesting that it be able to be used for
         context initiation only.
   o  public static final int ACCEPT_ONLY = 2
         Credential usage flag requesting that it be able to be used for
         context acceptance only.

3.  Major Status Code Constant Values

   All the GSS-API routines return two distinct values to report status
   information to the caller: GSS status codes and mechanism status
   codes.  The errors indicated via a GSS status code are generic API
   routine errors as defined in the GSS-API specification, and indicate
   errors that are independent of the underlying mechanism(s) used to
   provide the security service.

   The Java Bindings of GSS-API as specified in RFC 2853, use the Java
   exception mechanism for reporting GSS errors.  A GSSException is
   thrown whenever a fatal GSS-API error occurs including mechanism
   specific errors.  It may contain both the major and minor GSS-API
   status codes.  All Java GSS-API methods are declared as throwing this
   exception.  All the valid GSS-API status code values are declared as
   constants in the GSSException class.

   RFC 2853 section 6.8.1 specifies static constants for GSS status
   codes used to define all the major valid GSS-API error codes.

   This draft updates RFC 2853 section 6.8.1 to define the correct GSS
   status code values, and obsoletes the GSS status code values defined
   in section 4.12.1.

   The updated GSS Status code values are:
   o  public static final int BAD_BINDINGS = 1
         Incorrect channel bindings were supplied.
   o  public static final int BAD_MECH = 2
         An unsupported mechanism was requested.
   o  public static final int BAD_NAME = 3
         An invalid name was supplied.
   o  public static final int BAD_NAMETYPE = 4
         A supplied name was of an unsupported type.
   o  public static final int BAD_STATUS = 5
         An invalid status code was supplied.
   o  public static final int BAD_MIC = 6
         A token had an invalid MIC.
   o  public static final int CONTEXT_EXPIRED = 7
         The context has expired.
   o  public static final int CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED = 8
         The referenced credentials have expired.
   o  public static final int DEFECTIVE_CREDENTIAL = 9
         A supplied credential was invalid.
   o  public static final int DEFECTIVE_TOKEN = 10
         A supplied token was invalid.
   o  public static final int FAILURE = 11
         Miscellaneous failure, unspecified at the GSS-API level.
   o  public static final int NO_CONTEXT = 12

         Invalid context has been supplied.
   o  public static final int NO_CRED = 13
         No credentials were supplied, or the credentials were
         unavailable or inaccessible.
   o  public static final int BAD_QOP = 14
         The quality-of-protection requested could not be provided.
   o  public static final int UNAUTHORIZED = 15
         The operation is forbidden by local security policy.
   o  public static final int UNAVAILABLE = 16
         The operation or option is unavailable.
   o  public static final int DUPLICATE_ELEMENT = 17
         The requested credential element already exists.
   o  public static final int NAME_NOT_MN = 18
         The provided name was not a mechanism name.
   o  public static final int DUPLICATE_TOKEN = 19
         The token was a duplicate of an earlier version.
   o  public static final int OLD_TOKEN = 20
         The token's validity period has expired.
   o  public static final int UNSEQ_TOKEN = 21
         A latter token has already been processed.
   o  public static final int GAP_TOKEN = 22
         An expected per-message token was not received.
