Notes:

This spec does obsolete RFC 2731. The ID http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-reschke-rfc2731bis-05 says that, and it was approved that way (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-reschke-rfc2731bis/#writeup).

(Note that my records show that the AUTH48 version of the XML version of this document is correct, so the error was introduced later on).



     RFC 2731 ("Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML") Is Obsolete

Abstract

   This document obsoletes RFC 2731, "Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in
   HTML", as further development of this specification has moved to the
   Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI).

1.  Introduction

   [RFC2731] defines "Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML".  Newer
   specifications published by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
   (http://dublincore.org/) over the last decade, in particular
   "Expressing Dublin Core metadata using HTML/XHTML meta and link
   elements" ([DC-HTML]), have obsoleted this work.

      Note: Implementers of RFC 2731 should note that DC-HTML introduces
      a new requirement with respect to the use of the "head" element's
      "profile" attribute.

2.  Security Considerations

   This document is of administrative nature only and therefore there
   are no security relations related to it.
