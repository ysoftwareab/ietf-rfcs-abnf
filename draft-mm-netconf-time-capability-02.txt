                  draft-mm-netconf-time-capability-02.txt


Abstract

   This document defines a capability-based extension to the Network
   Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) that allows time-triggered
   configuration and management operations. This extension allows
   NETCONF clients to invoke configuration updates according to
   scheduled times, and allows NETCONF servers to attach timestamps to
   the data they send to NETCONF clients.

1. Introduction

   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) defined in [RFC6241]
   provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the

   configuration of network devices. NETCONF allows clients to configure
   and monitor NETCONF servers using remote procedure calls (RPC).

   NETCONF, as defined in [RFC6241], is asynchronous; when a client
   invokes an RPC, it has no control over the time at which the RPC is
   executed, nor does it have any feedback from the server about the
   execution time.

   Time-based configuration ([HotSDN], [TimeTR]) can be a useful tool
   that enables an entire class of coordinated and scheduled
   configuration procedures. Time-triggered configuration allows
   coordinated network updates in multiple devices; a client can invoke
   a coordinated configuration change by sending RPCs to multiple
   servers with the same scheduled execution time. A client can also
   invoke a time-based sequence of updates by sending n RPCs with n
   different update times, T1, T2, ..., Tn, determining the order in
   which the RPCs are executed.

   This memo defines the time capability in NETCONF. This extension
   allows clients to determine the scheduled execution time of RPCs they
   send. It also allows a server that receives an RPC to report its
   actual execution time to the client.

   o Client [RFC6142]: Invokes protocol operations on a server.  In
      addition, a client can subscribe to receive notifications from a
      server.

Internet-Draft       Time Capability in NETCONF              June 2014


   o Execution time: The execution time of an RPC is defined as the
      time at which a server completes the execution of an RPC.

   o Scheduled time: The scheduled time of an RPC is the time at which
      the RPC should be invoked. The scheduled time is determined by the
      client, and enforced by the server.

   o Server [RFC6142]: Executes protocol operations invoked by a
      client.  In addition, a server can send notifications to a client.

3. Using Time in NETCONF

3.1. The Time Capability in a Nutshell

   The :time capability provides two main functions:

   o Scheduling:
      When a client sends an RPC to a server, the RPC message MAY
      include a scheduled time, Ts (see Figure 1). The server then
      executes the RPC at the scheduled time Ts, and once completed the
      server can respond with an RPC reply message.

   o Reporting:
      When a client sends an RPC to a server, the RPC message MAY
      include a get-time element (see Figure 2), requesting the server
      to return the execution time of the RPC. In this case, after the
      server performs the RPC it responds with an RPC reply that
      includes the execution time, Te.

              Figure 2 Reporting the Execution Time of an RPC

   The two scenarios discussed above imply that a third scenario can
   also be supported (Figure 3), where the client invokes an RPC that
   includes a scheduled time, Ts, as well as the get-time element. This
   allows the client to receive feedback about the actual execution
   time, Te. Ideally, Ts=Te. However, the server may execute the RPC at
   a slightly different time than Ts, for example if the server is tied
   up with other tasks at Ts.

3.2. Notifications and Cancellation Messages

Notifications

   As illustrated in Figure 1, after a scheduled RPC is executed the
   server sends an rpc-reply. The rpc-reply may arrive a long period of
   time after the RPC was sent by the client, leaving the client without
   a clear indication of whether the RPC was received.

   This document defines a new notification, the netconf-scheduled-
   message notification, which provides an immediate acknowledgement of
   the scheduled RPC.

   The netconf-scheduled-message is sent to the client if it is
   subscribed to the NETCONF notifications [RFC6470]; as illustrated in
   Figure 4, when the server receives a scheduled RPC it sends a
   notification that includes the message-id of the scheduled RPC.

                 Figure 4 Scheduled RPC with Notification

Cancellation Messages

   A client can cancel a scheduled RPC by sending a <cancel-schedule>
   RPC.

   The <cancel-schedule> RPC, defined in this document, can be used to
   perform a coordinated all-or-none procedure, where either all the
   servers perform the operation on schedule, or the operation is
   aborted.

   Example. The client sends scheduled RPC messages to server 1 and
   server 2, both scheduled to Ts. Server 1 sends a notification that
   indicates it has successfully schedled the RPC, while server 2
   replies with an unknown-element error [RFC6241] that indicates that
   it does not support the time capability. The client sends a <cancel-
   schedule> RPC to server 1, and receives an rpc-reply. The message
   exchange between the client and server 1 in this example is
   illustrated in Figure 5.

3.3. Synchronization Aspects

   The time capability defined in this document requires clients and
   servers to maintain clocks. It is assumed that clocks are
   synchronized by a method that is outside the scope of this document,
   e.g., [NTP] or [IEEE1588].

   This document does not define any requirements pertaining to the
   degree of accuracy of performing scheduled RPCs. Note that two
   factors affect how accurately the server can perform a scheduled RPC;
   one factor is the accuracy of the clock synchronization method used
   to synchronize the clients and servers, and the second factor is the
   server's ability to execute real-time configuration changes, which
   greatly depends on how it is implemented. Typical networking devices
   are implemented by a combination of hardware and software. While the
   execution time of a hardware module can typically be predicted with a
   high level of accuracy, the execution time of a software module may
   be variable and hard to predict. A configuration update would
   typically require the server's software to be involved, thus
   affecting how accurately the RPC can be scheduled.

   Another important aspect of synchronization, is monitoring; a client
   should be able to check whether a server is synchronized to a
   reference time source. Typical synchronization protocols, such as the
   Network Time Protocol ([NTP], [RFC5907]) provide the means to verify
   that a clock is synchronized to a time reference by querying its
   Management Information Base (MIB). The get-time feature defined in
   this document (see Figure 2) allows a client to obtain a rough
   estimate of the time offset between the client's clock and the
   server's clock.

Internet-Draft       Time Capability in NETCONF              June 2014


   Since servers do not perform configuration changes instantaneously,
   the processing time of an RPC should not be overlooked. The scheduled
   time always refers to the start time of the RPC, and the execution
   time always refers to its completion time.

3.4. Scheduled Time Format

   The scheduled time and execution time fields in RPC messages use a
   common time format field.

   The time format used in this document is the date-and-time format,
   that is defined in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339] and in Section 3 of
   [RFC6021].


       leaf scheduled-time {
         description
         "The time at which the RPC is scheduled to be performed.";
         type yang:date-and-time;
       }


       leaf execution-time {
         description
         "The time at which the RPC was executed.";
         type yang:date-and-time;
       }

3.5. Scheduling Tolerance

   When a client sends an RPC that is scheduled to Ts, the server MUST
   verify that the value Ts is not too far in the past or in the future.
   As illustrated in Figure 6, the server verifies that Ts is within the
   scheduling tolerance range.

                   RPC _________
                 received       \
                                \/
                                      Ts
             -----+--------------+-----+------------+-------> time

                   <------------> <---------------->
                   sched-max-past  sched-max-future


                   <------------------------------->
                        scheduling tolerance

                       Figure 6 Scheduling Tolerance

   The scheduling tolerance is determined by two parameters,
   sched-max-future and sched-max-past. These two parameters use the
   time-interval format (Section 3.7.), and their default value is 15
   seconds.

   If the scheduled time, Ts is within the scheduling tolerance range,
   the scheduled RPC is performed; if Ts occurs in the past and within
   the scheduling tolerance, the server performs the RPC as soon as
   possible, whereas if Ts is a future time, the server performs the RPC
   at Ts.

   If Ts is not within the scheduling tolerance range, the server
   responds with an error message [RPC6241] with a bad-element error-
   tag. An example is provided in Section 5.3.

3.6. Near Future Scheduling vs. Far Future Scheduling

   The scheduling bound defined by sched-max-future guarantees that
   every scheduled RPCs is restricted to a near future scheduling time.

   The scheduling mechanism defined in this document is intended for
   near future scheduling, on the order of seconds. Far future
   scheduling is outside the scope of this document.

   The challenge in far future scheduling is that during the long period
   between the time at which the RPC is sent and the time at which it is
   scheduled to be executed various external events may occur, e.g., the
   client may fail or reboot, or the client access permissions may be
   changed. In these cases if the server performs the scheduled
   operation it may perform an action that is inconsistent with the


Mizrahi, Moses        Expires December 26, 2014               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       Time Capability in NETCONF              June 2014


   current network policy, or inconsistent with the currently active
   clients.

   Near future scheduling guarantees that external events such as the
   examples above have a low probability of occurring during the sched-
   max-future period, and even when they do, the period of inconsistency
   is limited to sched-max-future, which is a short period of time.

3.7. Time Interval Format

   The time-interval format is used for representing the length of a
   time interval, and is based on the date-and-time format. It is used
   for representing the scheduling tolerance parameters, as described in
   the previous section.

   While the date-and-time type uniquely represents a specific point in
   time, the time-interval type defined below can be used to represent
   the length of a time interval without specifying a specific date.

   The time-interval type is defined as follows:

      typedef time-interval {
        type string {
          pattern '\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}(\.\d+)?';
        }
      }
4. Time Capability

   The structure of this section is as defined in Appendix D of
   [RFC6241].

4.1. Overview

   A server that supports the time capability can perform time-triggered
   operations as defined in this document.

   A server implementing the :time capability:

   o MUST support the ability to receive <rpc> messages that include a
      time element, and perform a time-triggered operation accordingly.

   o MUST support the ability to include a time element in the <rpc-
      reply> messages that it transmits.

Internet-Draft       Time Capability in NETCONF              June 2014


4.2. Dependencies

With-defaults Capability

   The time capability YANG module (Appendix A.) uses default values,
   and thus it is assumed that the with-defaults capability [RFC6243] is
   supported.

4.3. Capability Identifier

   The :time capability is identified by the following capability string
   (to be assigned by IANA - see Section 7.):

   urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:time:1.0

4.4. New Operations

<cancel-schedule>

   The cancel-schedule RPC is used for cancelling an RPC that was
   previously scheduled.

   A cancel-schedule RPC MUST include the <cancelled-message-id>
   element, which specifies the message ID of the scheduled RPC that
   needs to be cancelled.

   A cancel-schedule RPC MAY include the <get-time> element. In this
   case the rpc-reply includes the <execution-time> element, specifying
   the time at which the scheduled RPC was cancelled.

4.5. Modifications to Existing Operations

   Three new elements are added to all existing operations:

   o <scheduled-time>
      This element is added to the input of each operation, indicating
      the time at which the server is scheduled to invoke the operation.
      Every <rpc> message MAY include the <scheduled-time> element. A
      server that supports the :time capability and receives an <rpc>
      message with a <scheduled-time> element MUST perform the operation
      as close as possible to the scheduled time.

      The scheduled-time element uses the date-and-time format
      (Section 3.4.).

Internet-Draft       Time Capability in NETCONF              June 2014


   o <get-time>
      This element is added to the input of each operation. An <rpc>
      message MAY include a <get-time> element, indicating that the
      server MUST include an <execution-time> in its corresponding <rpc-
      reply>.

   o <execution-time>
      This element is added to the output of each operation, indicating
      the time at which the server completed the operation. An <rpc-
      reply> MAY include the <execution-time> element. A server that
      supports the :time capability and receives an operation with the
      <get-time> element MUST include the execution time in its
      response.

      The execution-time element uses the date-and-time format
      (Section 3.4.).

   The confirmed commit capability is defined in Section 8.4 of
   [RFC6241]. According to [RFC6241], a confirmed <commit> operation
   MUST be reverted if a confirming commit is not issued within the
   timeout period (which by default is 600 seconds).

   When the time capability is supported, and a confirmed <commit>
   operation is used with the <scheduled-time> element, the confirmation
   timeout MUST be counted from the scheduled time, i.e., the client
   begins the timeout measurement starting at the scheduled time.

5. Examples

5.1. <scheduled-time> Example

   The following example extends the example presented in Section 7.2 of
   [RFC6241] by adding the time capability. In this example, the
   <scheduled-time> element is used to specify the scheduled execution
   time of the configuration update (as shown in Figure 1).

   <rpc message-id="101"
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <edit-config>
       <target>
         <running/>
       </target>

          xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-time">
           2015-10-21T04:29:00.235Z
       </scheduled-time>
       <config>
         <top xmlns="http://example.com/schema/1.2/config">
           <interface>
             <name>Ethernet0/0</name>
             <mtu>1500</mtu>
           </interface>
         </top>
       </config>
     </edit-config>
   </rpc>

   <rpc-reply message-id="101"
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <ok/>
   </rpc-reply>


5.2. <get-time> Example

   The following example is similar to the one presented in Section 5.1.
   , except that in this example the client includes a <get-time>
   element in its RPC, and the server consequently responds with an
   <execution-time> element (as shown in Figure 2).

   <rpc message-id="101"
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <edit-config>
       <target>
         <running/>
       </target>
       <get-time
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-time">
       </get-time>
       <config>
         <top xmlns="http://example.com/schema/1.2/config">
           <interface>
             <name>Ethernet0/0</name>
             <mtu>1500</mtu>

           </interface>
         </top>
       </config>
     </edit-config>
   </rpc>

   <rpc-reply message-id="101"
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <ok/>
     <execution-time>
         2015-10-21T04:29:00.235Z
     </execution-time>
   </rpc-reply>

5.3. Error Example

   The following example presents a scenario in which the scheduled-time
   is not within the scheduling tolerance, i.e., it is too far in the
   past, and therefore an rpc-error is returned.

   <rpc message-id="101"
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <edit-config>
       <target>
         <running/>
       </target>
       <scheduled-time
          xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-time">
           2010-10-21T04:29:00.235Z
       </scheduled-time>
       <config>
         <top xmlns="http://example.com/schema/1.2/config">
           <interface>
             <name>Ethernet0/0</name>
             <mtu>1500</mtu>
           </interface>
         </top>
       </config>
     </edit-config>
   </rpc>

   <rpc-reply message-id="101"

6. Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the NETCONF protocol in general are
   discussed in [RFC6241].

   The usage of the time capability defined in this document can assist
   an attacker in gathering information about the system, such as the
   exact time of future configuration changes. Moreover, the time
   elements can potentially allow an attacker to learn information about
   the system's performance. Furthermore, an attacker that sends
   malicious RPC messages can use the time capability to amplify her
   attack; for example, by sending multiple RPC messages with the same
   scheduled time. It is important to note that the security measures
   described in [RFC6241] can prevent these vulnerabilities.

   The time capability relies on an underlying time synchronization
   protocol. Thus, an attack against the time protocol can potentially
   compromise NETCONF when using the time capability. A detailed
   discussion about the threats against time protocols and how to
   mitigate them is presented in [TimeSec].

7. IANA Considerations

   This document proposes to register the following capability
   identifier URN in the 'Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)
   Capability URNs' registry:

        urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:time:1.0

   This document proposes to register the following XML namespace URN
   in the 'IETF XML registry', following the format defined in
   [RFC3688]:

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-time
