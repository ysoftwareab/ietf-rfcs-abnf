                    Using SSRC with WebRTC Simulcast
               draft-alvestrand-mmusic-simulcast-ssrc-01

Abstract

   This document describes a convention for sending "a=ssrc" attributes
   in SDP together with "a=simulcast" attributes.  This allows SFUs that
   need SSRC information to have this info easily accessible.

   Given that it is intended as an interim measure, it does not aim for
   being published as an RFC.

1.  Introduction

   In developing the WebRTC specification, the IETF decided on a form of
   simulcast that doesn't require fixed SSRC allocation, but rather used
   a combination of SDP tags (a=rid) [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rid] and RTP
   header extensions (RTPStreamId) [I-D.ietf-avtext-rid] to describe the
   mapping between simulcast layers and RTP streams.

   The SDP format is described in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-simulcast].

   This posed a problem for some SFUs, which required information on
   what SSRCs the incoming streams were going to appear on in order to
   be configured correctly.

   This document gives a convention for adding information about SSRCs
   to the SDP produced by conformant WebRTC implementations in order to
   make this information available.

   This document does not specify an Internet standard.  It is an
   interim measure, intended to be useful in the time between the
   introduction of RID-based simulcast in browsers and the full support
   of RID-based simulcast by SFUs.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  How to represent SSRC information

   The syntax for representing SSRC information is taken from [RFC5576].

   Each media section in the SDP contains one a=ssrc attribute per
   simulcast stream, formatted as "a=ssrc:<ssrc> cname:<cname>".  The
   cname is the sender's single cname as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage]; carrying some attribute is required by
   the "a=ssrc" syntax, and sending the cname is compatible with what
   has been done in other instances.

   The list of SSRCs used is declared in an attribute with the SIM
   (Simulcast) semantic, which is registered by this memo.

   The order of SSRCs in the a=ssrc-group attribute MUST match the order
   of the rid attributes in the corresponding streams in the "send" part
   of the a=simulcast: attribute.

   It is RECOMMENDED that both the a=rid: attributes and the a=ssrc:
   attributes appear in the same order as the order in the a=simulcast
   and a=ssrc-group attributes.

   It is RECOMMENDED not to use RTX with this configuration, since the
   inclusion of the required declarations for associating RTX SSRCs with
   their main SSRCs would make the SDP unwieldy and hard to interpret
   correctly.

4.  How to request that SSRC information be included

   If an SFU wishes to request that a browser send SSRC information, it
   should send an offer containing the line "a=x-please-send-ssrcs",
   together with a line requesting simulcast:

   m=video
   a=simulcast:recv a,b,c
   a=please-send-ssrcs

   The SFU can detect whether the request has been honored by looking
   for a=ssrc attributes in the responding answer.

Internet-Draft               Simulcast SSRC                    July 2019


   If a Javascript application wishes to request that the browser
   generate offers containing SSRC, it can include the non-standard
   attribute "showSsrcInSimulcastOffer" in the RTCPeerConnection
   constructor:

   pc = new RTCPeerConnection({showSsrcInSimulcastOffer: true})

   It is possible to verify that the request is understood by checking
   for the presence of this attribute in the RTCPeerConnection
   parameters:

   if ('showSsrcInSimulcastOffer' in pc.getConfiguration()) {
      // the request has been understood correctly
   }

   Formally, this amounts to changing the API of a W3C specification,
   but adding nonstandard attributes to an initialization dictionary has
   been done before in other contexts; it seems like a relatively
   harmless thing to do, but should be reviewed in the W3C WEBRTC WG
   anyway.  Publishing a separate extension document in the W3C seems
   like bureaucratic overkill.

5.  Example

   m=video
   a=simulcast:send hi,mid,low
   a=rid:hi send
   a=rid:mid send
   a=rid:low send
   a=ssrc-group:SIM 123 456 789
   a=ssrc:123 cname:foo
   a=ssrc:456 cname:foo
   a=ssrc:789 cname:foo

6.  Sunsetting the interim measure

   This specification is intended to give SFU authors time to convert to
   the new mechanism.  Since the invocation of this mechanism is
   explicit, it is easy to check on what the usage is, and emit
   deprecation warnings; those should probably be emitted from day 1.

   Once enough time has passed, this mechanism can be removed.

7.  Open questions

   NOTE IN DRAFT: The goal is to make this section empty.

Internet-Draft               Simulcast SSRC                    July 2019


   It's been suggested that it's better to replace the a=ssrc-group:
   line with new tag fields either on the a=ssrc: lines or the a=rid:
   lines, thus giving explicit correlation.  This, however, breaks the
   standard format of those lines.  Inventing new syntax for an interim
   solution seems like a Bad Thing.

   People have asked whether and how this document should be published.
   If it makes sense to publish it as a historical record, it might make
   sense to publish as an RFC; it does not make sense to the author to
   ask for standards track publication.  At the moment, it claims that
   publication is not sought.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes two existing mechanisms: a=simulcast and
   a=ssrc-group.  Each of these is defined in an RFC with security
   considerations.

   The only added attack surface here is the ability to create
   mismatches between the two lists of simulcast RTP streams, causing
   different implementations to choose different streams to display.
   This is a special instance of the general rule that "people who can
   modify your SDP can mess things up"; normal precautions when passing
   SDP around should be adequate.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the "SIM" value of "ssrc-group" in the
   registry titled "Semantics for the "ssrc-group" SDP Attribute",
   according to the procedures of [RFC5576] section 12.3.  That document
   specifies that registration requires a standards-track document.

   o  Semantics: Simulcast group

   o  Token: SIM

   o  Reference: RFC XXXX

   This document registers the "please-send-ssrc" attribute in the
   registry titled "att-field (media level only)" according to the
   procedures of [RFC4566] section 8.2.4.  That document specifies that
   the registry is of type "specification required".

   o  Contact: Harald Alvestrand, harald@alvestrand.no, +47 73 53 43 26

   o  Attribute name: please-send-ssrc

   o  Long-form attribute name: Please send SSRC

   o  Type of attribute: Media level

   o  Subject to the charset attribute: No

   o  Purpose: Indicates that the sender wishes to receive SSRC
      information in the form specified in RFC XXXX

   o  Appropriate values: Not relevant

   RFC Editor: Please replace "RFC XXXX" with the RFC number of this
   document, if published, and delete this paragraph.

   If the document succeeds in being transitory in nature, registration
   may not be needed.
