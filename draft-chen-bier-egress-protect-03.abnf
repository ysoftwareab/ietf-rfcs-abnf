BBFR-NBR = H and BFR-id = 4 is with BFR-NBR = H.

BEA = 1, it determines whether the current node is backup egress
Packet = the packet received by BFR;
BFER = H.  BE-BFER = H means that BFER H is the backup egress node
NBR = H, its F-BM in the first entry has the bit of BFR-id = 1 and
BFR-id = 4 in the first entry and the fourth entry, which are with
BFR-NBR = H.

P-FIB = P-FIB-4D (the pointer to the FIB for primary egress node D)
Packet = the packet received by BFR;
BFR-NBR = F.  The F-BM for each of these two rows in the BIFT is the
BE-BFER = 0/NULL.

BFR-NBR = H.  The F-BM for each of these two rows in the backup BIFT
NBR = E.  The F-BM for each of these two rows in the backup BIFT is
SC = 1.  The BitString in Packet is 01110 now.  BFR C copies, updates
