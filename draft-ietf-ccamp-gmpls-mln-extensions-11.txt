       Abstract 

          There are specific requirements for the support of networks 
          comprising Label Switching Routers (LSR) participating in 
          different data plane switching layers controlled by a single 
          Generalized Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control 
          plane instance, referred to as GMPLS Multi-Layer 
          Networks/Multi-Region Networks (MLN/MRN).  
           
          This document defines extensions to GMPLS routing and signaling 
          protocols so as to support the operation of GMPLS Multi-
          Layer/Multi-Region Networks. It covers the elements of a single 
          GMPLS control plane instance controlling multiple LSP regions 
          or layers within a single TE domain.

          [RFC3945], [RFC3471], [RFC4201], [RFC4202], [RFC4203], 
          [RFC4206], and [RFC5307]. 
           
       1. Introduction 

          Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] 
          extends MPLS to handle multiple switching technologies: packet 
          switching (PSC), layer-two switching (L2SC), TDM switching 
          (TDM), wavelength switching (LSC) and fiber switching (FSC). A 
          GMPLS switching type (PSC, TDM, etc.) describes the ability of 
          a node to forward data of a particular data plane technology, 
          and uniquely identifies a control plane Label Switched Path 
          (LSP) region. LSP Regions are defined in [RFC4206]. A network 
          comprised of multiple switching types (e.g. PSC and TDM) 
          controlled by a single GMPLS control plane instance is called a 
          Multi-Region Network (MRN).  
               
          A data plane layer is a collection of network resources capable 
          of terminating and/or switching data traffic of a particular 
          format. For example, LSC, TDM VC-11 and TDM VC-4-64c represent 
          three different layers. A network comprising transport nodes 
          participating in different data plane switching layers

          controlled by a single GMPLS control plane instance is called a 
          Multi-Layer Network (MLN).   
               
          The applicability of GMPLS to multiple switching technologies 
          provides the unified control and operations for both LSP 
          provisioning and recovery. This document covers the elements of 
          a single GMPLS control plane instance controlling multiple 
          layers within a given TE domain. A TE domain is defined as 
          group of Label Switching Routers (LSR) that enforces a common 
          TE policy. A Control Plane (CP) instance can serve one, two or 
          more layers. Other possible approaches such as having multiple 
          CP instances serving disjoint sets of layers are outside the 
          scope of this document.  
               
          The next sections provide the procedural aspects in terms of 
          routing and signaling for such environments as well as the 
          extensions required to instrument GMPLS to provide the 
          capabilities for MLM/MRN unified control. The rationales and 
          requirements for Multi-Layer/Region networks are set forth in 
          [RFC5212]. These requirements are evaluated against GMPLS 
          protocols in [RFC5339] and several areas where GMPLS protocol 
          extensions are required are identified.  
              
          This document defines GMPLS routing and signaling extensions so 
          as to cover GMPLS MLN/MRN requirements.    
           
       2. Summary of the Requirements and Evaluation  

          As identified in [RFC5339], most MLN/MRN requirements rely on 
          mechanisms and procedures (such as local procedures and 
          policies, or specific TE mechanisms and algorithms) that are 
          outside the scope of the GMPLS protocols, and thus do not 
          require any GMPLS protocol extensions. 
               
          Four areas for extensions of GMPLS protocols and procedures 
          have been identified in [RFC5339]:  
           
          o GMPLS routing extensions for the advertisement of the  
            internal adjustment capability of hybrid nodes. See Section  
            3.2.2 of [RFC5339]. 
           
          o GMPLS signaling extensions for constrained multi-region  
            signaling (Switching Capability inclusion/exclusion). See  
            Section 3.2.1 of [RFC5339]. An additional eXclude Route  
            object (XRO) Label subobject is also defined since absent  
            from [RFC4874].

          o GMPLS signaling extensions for the setup/deletion of Virtual  
            TE-links (as well as exact trigger for its actual  
            provisioning). See Section 3.1.1.2 of [RFC5339]. 
           
          o GMPLS routing and signaling extensions for graceful TE-link   
            deletion. See Section 3.1.1.3 of [RFC5339]. 
        
          The first three requirements are addressed in Sections 3, 4, 
          and 5 of this document, respectively. The fourth requirement is 
          addressed in [GMPLS-RR] with additional context provided by 
          [GR-TELINK]. 
           
       3. Interface adjustment capability descriptor (IACD) 

          In the MRN context, nodes that have at least one interface that 
          supports more than one switching capability are called Hybrid 
          nodes [RFC5212]. The logical composition of a hybrid node 
          contains at least two distinct switching elements that are 
          interconnected by "internal links" to provide adjustment 
          between the supported switching capabilities. These internal 
          links have finite capacities that MUST be taken into account 
          when computing the path of a multi-region TE-LSP. The 
          advertisement of the internal adjustment capability is required 
          as it provides critical information when performing multi-
          region path computation.  
               
       3.1. Overview  

          In an MRN environment, some LSRs could contain multiple 
          switching capabilities such as PSC and TDM, or PSC and LSC, all 
          under the control of a single GMPLS instance, 
           
          These nodes, hosting multiple Interface Switching Capabilities 
          (ISC) [RFC4202], are required to hold and advertise resource 
          information on link states and topology, just like other nodes 
          (hosting a single ISC). They may also have to consider some 
          portions of internal node resources use to terminate 
          hierarchical LSPs, since in circuit-switching technologies 
          (such as TDM, LSC, and FSC) LSPs require theuse of resources 
          allocated in a discrete manner (as pre-determined by the 
          switching type). For example, a node with PSC+LSC hierarchical 
          switching capability can switch a lambda LSP, but cannot 
          terminate the Lambda LSP if there is no available (i.e., not 
          already in use) adjustment capability between the LSC and the 
          PSC switching components. Another example occurs when L2SC

       Internet Draft                                  January 31, 2010 
           

          (Ethernet) switching can be adapted in LAPS X.86 and GFP for 
          instance before reaching the TDM switching matrix. Similar 
          circumstances can occur, if a switching fabric that supports 
          both PSC and L2SC functionalities is assembled with LSC 
          interfaces enabling "lambda" encoding. In the switching fabric, 
          some interfaces can terminate Lambda LSPs and perform frame (or 
          cell) switching whilst other interfaces can terminate Lambda 
          LSPs and perform packet switching. 
               
          Therefore, within multi-region networks, the advertisement of 
          the so-called adjustment capability to terminate LSPs (not the 
          interface capability since the latter can be inferred from the 
          bandwidth available for each switching capability) provides the 
          information to take into account when performing multi-region 
          path computation. This concept enables a node to discriminate 
          the remote nodes (and thus allows their selection during path 
          computation) with respect to their adjustment capability e.g. 
          to terminate LSPs at the PSC or LSC level.  
           
          Hence, we introduce the capability of discriminating the 
          (internal) adjustment capability from the (interface) switching 
          capability by defining an Interface Adjustment Capability 
          Descriptor (IACD).  
               
          A more detailed problem statement can be found in [RFC5339]. 
            
       3.2. Interface Adjustment Capability Descriptor (IACD)  

          The interface adjustment capability descriptor (IACD) provides 
          the information for the forwarding/switching) only capability.  
           
          Note that the addition of the IACD as a TE link attribute does 
          not modify the format of the Interface Switching Capability 
          Descriptor (ISCD) defined in [RFC4202], and does not change how 
          the ISCD sub-TLV is carried in the routing protocols or how it 
          is processed when it is received [RFC4201], [RFC4203]. 
           
          The receiving LSR uses its Link State Database to determine the 
          IACD(s) of the far-end of the link. Different Interface 
          Adjustment Capabilities at two ends of a TE link are allowed. 
            
       3.2.1 OSPF   
               
          In OSPF, the IACD sub-TLV is defined as an optional sub-TLV of 
          the TE Link TLV (Type 2, see [RFC3630]), with Type 24 (to be 
          assigned by IANA) and variable length.

             Upper Switching Capability (SC) field (byte 3) - 8 bits   
           
                Indicates the Upper Switching capability. The Upper  
                Switching Capability field MUST be set to one of the  
                values defined in [RFC4202].

                and to 0xFF when the corresponding SC value has no access  
                to the wire, i.e., there is no ISC sub-TLV for this upper  
                switching capability. The adjustment capacity is the set  
                of resources associated to the upper switching  
                capability.  
               
             The Adjustment Capability-specific information - variable 
           
                This field is defined so as to leave the possibility for  
                future addition of technology-specific information  
                associated to the adjustment capability. 
           
             Other fields MUST be processed as specified in [RFC4202] and    
             [RFC4203]. 
           
          The bandwidth values provide an indication of the resources 
          still available to perform insertion/extraction for a given 
          adjustment at a given priority (resource pool concept: set of 
          shareable available resources that can be assigned 
          dynamically).  
            
          Multiple IACD sub-TLVs MAY be present within a given TE Link

          The presence of the IACD sub-TLV as part of the TE Link TLV 
          does not modify the format/messaging and the processing

       4. Multi-Region Signaling  

          Section 6.2 of [RFC4206] specifies that when a region boundary 
          node receives a Path message, the node determines whether or 
          not it is at the edge of an LSP region with respect to the ERO 
          carried in the message. If the node is at the edge of a region, 
          it must then determine the other edge of the region with 
          respect to the ERO, using the IGP database. The node then 
          extracts from the ERO the sub-sequence of hops from itself to 
          the other end of the region.

          The node then compares the sub-sequence of hops with all 
          existing FA-LSPs originated by the node:   
              
          o If a match is found, that FA-LSP has enough unreserved  
            bandwidth for the LSP being signaled, and the G-PID of the  
            FA-LSP is compatible with the G-PID of the LSP being  
            signaled, the node uses that FA-LSP as follows. The Path  
            message for the original LSP is sent to the egress of the FA- 
            LSP. The PHOP in the message is the address of the node at  
            the head-end of the FA-LSP. Before sending the Path message,  
            the ERO in that message is adjusted by removing the  
            subsequence of the ERO that lies in the FA-LSP, and replacing  
            it with just the end point of the FA-LSP.  
              
          o If no existing FA-LSP is found, the node sets up a new FA- 
            LSP. That is, it initiates a new LSP setup just for the FA- 
            LSP.    
               
            Note: compatible G-PID implies that traffic can be processed  
            by both ends of the FA-LSP without dropping traffic after its  
            establishment.  
               
          Applying the procedure of [RFC4206], in a MRN environment MAY 
          lead to setup single-hop FA-LSPs between each pair of nodes. 
          Therefore, considering that the path computation is able to 
          take into account richness of information with regard to the SC 
          available on given nodes belonging to the path, it is 
          consistent to provide enough signaling information to indicate 
          the SC to be used and over which link. Particularly, in case a 
          TE link has multiple SCs advertised as part of its ISCD sub-
          TLVs, an ERO does not provide a mechanism to select a 
          particular SC.  
               
          In order to limit the modifications to existing RSVP-TE 
          procedures ([RFC3473] and referenced), this document defines a 
          new sub-object of the eXclude Route Object (XRO), see 
          [RFC4874], called the Switching Capability sub-object. This 
          sub-object enables (when desired) the explicit identification 
          of at least one switching capability to be excluded from the 
          resource selection process described above. 
               
          Including this sub-object as part of the XRO that explicitly 
          indicates which SCs have to be excluded (before initiating the 
          procedure described here above) over a specified TE link, 
          solves the ambiguous choice among SCs that are potentially used

          along a given path and give the possibility to optimize 
          resource usage on a multi-region basis. Note that implicit SC 
          inclusion is easily supported by explicitly excluding other SCs 
          (e.g. to include LSC, it is required to exclude PSC, L2SC, TDM 
          and FSC).  
           
          The approach followed here is to concentrate exclusions in XRO 
          and inclusions in ERO. Indeed, the ERO specifies the 
          topological characteristics of the path to be signaled. Usage 
          of EXRS subobjects would also lead in the exclusion over 
          certain portions of the LSP during the FA-LSP setup. Thus, it 
          is more suited to extend generality of the elements to the 
          excluded in the XRO but also prevent complex consistency checks 
          but also transpositions between EXRS and XRO at FA-LSP head-
          ends.  
               
       4.1. XRO Subobject Encoding  

          The contents of an EXCLUDE_ROUTE object defined in [RFC4874] 
          are a series of variable-length data items called subobjects.  
           
          This document defines the Switching Capability (SC) subobject 
          of the XRO (Type 35), its encoding and processing. It also 
          complements the subobjects defined in [RFC4874] with a Label 
          subobject (Type 3).

          or more numbered or unnumbered interface sub-objects to which 
          this sub-object refers.  
           
          In case, of loose hop ERO subobject, the XRO sub-object MUST 
          precede the loose-hop sub-object identifying the tail-end 
          node/interface of the traversed region(s).

          The encoding of the Label XRO Subobject is identical to the 
          Label ERO Subobject defined in [RFC3473] with the exception of 
          the L bit. For the Label XRO Subobject, the L bit is defined 
          as:   
           
             L 
                0 indicates that the attribute specified MUST be  
                  excluded. 
                
                1 indicates that the attribute specified SHOULD be  
                  avoided. 
           
          Label subobjects MUST follow the numbered or unnumbered 
          interface sub-objects to which they refer, and, when present, 
          MUST also follow the Switching Capability sub-object. 
           
          When XRO label sub-objects are following the Switching 
          Capability sub-object, the corresponding label values MUST be 
          compatible with the SC capability to be explicitly excluded.  
           
       5. Virtual TE link  

          A virtual TE link is defined as a TE link between two upper 
          layer nodes that is not associated with a fully provisioned FA-
          LSP in a lower layer [RFC5212]. A virtual TE link is advertised 
          as any TE link, following the rules in [RFC4206] defined for 
          fully provisioned TE links. A virtual TE link represents thus

          as is the case for any TE link.   
           
          Two techniques can be used for the setup, operation, and 
          maintenance of virtual TE links. The corresponding GMPLS 
          protocols extensions are described in this section. The 
          procedures described in this section complement those defined 
          in [RFC4206] and [HIER-BIS]. 
               
       5.1. Edge-to-edge Association     

          This approach, that does not require state maintenance on 
          transit LSRs, relies on extensions to the GMPLS RSVP-TE Call 
          procedure (see [RFC4974]). This technique consists of 
          exchanging identification and TE attributes information 
          directly between TE link end points throughthe establishment of 
          a call between terminating LSRs. These TE link end-points 
          correspond to the LSP head-end and tail-end points of the LSPs 
          that will be established. The end-points MUST belong to the 
          same (LSP) region. 
               
          Once the call is established the resulting association 
          populates the local Traffic Engineering DataBase (TEDB) and the 
          resulting virtual TE link is advertised as any other TE link. 
          The latter can then be used to attract traffic. When an upper 
          layer/region LSP tries to make use of this virtual TE link, one 
          or more FA LSPs MUST be established using the procedures 
          defined in [RFC4206] to make the virtual TE link "real" and 
          allow it to carry traffic by nesting the upper layer/region 
          LSP. 
               
          In order to distinguish usage of such call from the call and 
          associated procedures defined in [RFC4974], a CALL ATTRIBUTES 
          object is introduced.  
               
       5.1.1 CALL_ATTRIBUTES Object  
               
          The CALL_ATTRIBUTES object is used to signal attributes 
          required in support of a call, or to indicate the nature or use 
          of a call. It is modeled on the LSP-ATTRIBUTES object defined 
          in [RFC5420]. The CALL_ATTRIBUTES object MAY also be used to 
          report call operational state on a Notify message.

          The CALL_ATTRIBUTES object class is 201 (TBD by IANA) of the 
          form 11bbbbbb. This C-Num value (see [RFC2205], Section 3.10) 
          ensures that LSRs that do not recognize the object pass it on 
          transparently.   
               
          One C-Type is defined, C-Type = 1 for CALL Attributes. This 
          object is OPTIONAL and MAY be placed on Notify messages to 
          convey additional information about the desired attributes of 
          the call.

          The Attributes TLVs are encoded as described in Section 5.1.3.  
           
       5.1.2 Processing  
               
          If an egress (or intermediate) LSR does not support the object, 
          it forwards it unexamined and unchanged. This facilitates the 
          exchange of attributes across legacy networks that do not 
          support this new object.  
            
       5.1.3 Attributes TLVs  
               
          Attributes carried by the CALL_ATTRIBUTES object are encoded 
          within TLVs. One or more TLVs MAY be present in each object.  
               
          There are no ordering rules for TLVs, and no interpretation 
          SHOULD be placed on the order in which TLVs are received.

             Length  
                
                Indicates the total length of the TLV in octets. That  
                is, the combined length of the Type, Length, and Value  
                fields, i.e., four plus the length of the Value field in  
                octets. 
            
                The entire TLV MUST be padded with between zero and three 
                trailing zeros to make it four-octet aligned.  The Length  
                field does not count any padding. 
                                       
             Value  
                   
                The data field for the TLV padded as described above.  
           
       5.1.4 Attributes Flags TLV  
               
          The TLV Type 1 indicates the Attributes Flags TLV. Other TLV 
          types MAY be defined in the future with type values assigned by 
          IANA (see Section 8). The Attributes Flags TLV MAY be present 
          in a CALL_ATTRIBUTES object.    
               
          The Attribute Flags TLV value field is an array of units of 32 
          flags numbered from the most significant bit as bit zero. The 
          Length field for this TLV is therefore always a multiple of 4 
          bytes, regardless of the number of bits carried and no padding 
          is required.  
               
          Unassigned bits are considered as reserved and MUST be set to 
          zero on transmission by the originator of the object. Bits not

          contained in the TLV MUST be assumed to be set to zero. If the 
          TLV is absent either because it is not contained in the 
          CALL_ATTRIBUTES object or because this object is itself absent, 
          all processing MUST be performed as though the bits were 
          present and set to zero. That is to say, assigned bits that are 
          not present either because the TLV is deliberately 
          foreshortened or because the TLV is not included MUST be 
          treated as though they are present and are set to zero.  
            
       5.1.5 Call Inheritance Flag  
               
          This document introduces a specific flag (most significant bit 
          (msb) position bit 0) of the Attributes Flags TLV, to indicate 
          that the association initiated between the end-points belonging 
          to a call results into a (virtual) TE link advertisement. 
               
          The Call Inheritance Flag MUST be set to 1 in order to indicate 
          that the established association is to be translated into a TE 
          link advertisement. The value of this flag SHALL by default be 
          set to 1. Setting this flag to 0 results in a hidden TE link or 
          in deleting the corresponding TE link advertisement (by setting 
          the corresponding Opaque LSA Age to MaxAge) if the association 
          had been established with this flag set to 1. In the latter 
          case, the corresponding FA-LSP SHOULD also be torn down to 
          prevent unused resources. 
            
          The Notify message used for establishing the association is 
          defined as per [RFC4974]. Additionally, the Notify message MUST 
          carry an LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object, that allows 
          identifying unnumbered FA-LSPs ([RFC3477], [RFC4206], [HIER-
          BIS]) and numbered FA-LSPs ([RFC4206], [HIER-BIS]). 
           
       5.2. Soft Forwarding Adjacency (Soft FA)                             

          The Soft Forwarding Adjacency (Soft FA) approach consists of 
          setting up the FA LSP at the control plane level without 
          actually committing resources in the data plane. This means 
          that the corresponding LSP exists only in the control plane 
          domain. Once such FA is established the corresponding TE link 
          can be advertised following the procedures described in 
          [RFC4206].  
               
          There are two techniques to setup Soft FAs:  
           
          o The first one consists in setting up the FA LSP by precluding  
            resource commitment during its establishment. These are known

            as pre-planned LSPs. 
           
          o The second technique consists in making use of path  
            provisioned LSPs only. In this case, there is no associated  
            resource demand during the LSP establishment. This can be  
            considered as the RSVP-TE equivalent of the Null service type  
            specified in [RFC2997].   
               
       5.2.1 Pre-Planned LSP Flag   
               
          The LSP ATTRIBUTES object and Attributes Flags TLV are defined 
          in [RFC5420]. The present document defines a new flag, the Pre-
          Planned LSP flag, in the existing Attributes Flags TLV 
          (numbered as Type 1).   
               
          The position of this flag is TBD in accordance with IANA 
          assignment. This flag, part of the Attributes Flags TLV, 
          follows general processing of [RFC5420] for 
          LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE object. That is, LSRs that do not 
          recognize the object reject the LSP setup effectively saying 
          that they do not support the attributes requested. Indeed, the 
          newly defined attribute requires examination at all transit 
          LSRs along the LSP being established.    
               
          The Pre-Planned LSP flag can take one of the following values:  
               
          o When set to 0 this means that the LSP MUST be fully  
            provisioned. Absence of this flag (hence corresponding TLV)  
            is therefore compliant with the signaling message processing  
            per [RFC3473]).  
               
          o When set to 1 this means that the LSP MUST be provisioned in  
            the control plane only.  
           
          If an LSP is established with the Pre-Planned flag set to 1, no 
          resources are committed at the data plane level. 
               
          The operation of committing data plane resources occurs by re-
          signaling the same LSP with the Pre-Planned flag set to 0. It 
          is RECOMMENDED that no other modifications are made to other 
          RSVP objects during this operation. That is each intermediate 
          node, processing a flag transiting from 1 to 0 shall only be 
          concerned with the commitment of data plane resources and no 
          other modification of the LSP properties and/or attributes.

          If an LSP is established with the Pre-Planned flag set to 0, it 
          MAY be re-signaled by setting the flag to 1.    
               
       5.2.2 Path Provisioned LSPs  
               
          There is a difference in between an LSP that is established 
          with 0 bandwidth (path provisioning) and an LSP that is 
          established with a certain bandwidth value not committed at the 
          data plane level (i.e. pre-planned LSP).   
        
          Mechanisms for provisioning (pre-planned or not) LSP with 0 
          bandwidth  is straightforward for PSC the SENDER_TSPEC/ 
          FLOWSPEC, the Peak Data Rate field of Int-Serv objects, see 
          [RFC2210], is set to 0. For L2SC LSP, the CIR, EIR, CBS, and 
          EBS MUST be set of 0 in the Type 2 sub-TLV of the Ethernet 
          Bandwidth Profile TLV. In these cases, upon LSP resource 
          commitment, actual traffic parameter values are used to perform 
          corresponding resource reservation.  
               
          However, mechanisms for provisioning (pre-planned or not) TDM 
          or LSC LSP with 0 bandwidth is currently not possible because 
          the exchanged label value is tightly coupled with resource 
          allocation during LSP signaling (see e.g. [RFC4606] for 
          SDH/SONET LSP). For TDM and LSC LSP, a NULL Label value is used 
          to prevent resource allocation at the data plane level. In 
          these cases, upon LSP resource commitment, actual label value 
          exchange is performed to commit allocation of timeslots/ 
          wavelengths. 
           
       6. Backward Compatibility  

          New objects and procedures defined in this document are running 
          within a given TE domain, defined as group of LSRs that 
          enforces a common TE policy. Thus, the extensions defined in 
          this document are expected to run in the context of a 
          consistent TE policy. Specification of a consistent TE policy 
          is outside the scope of this document. 
               
          In such TE domains, we distinguish between edge LSRs and 
          intermediate LSRs. Edge LSRs MUST be able to process Call 
          Attribute as defined in Section 5.1 if this is the method 
          selected for creating edge-to-edge associations. In that 
          domain, intermediate LSRs are by definition transparent to the 
          Call processing.

          In case the Soft FA method is used for the creation of virtual 
          TE links, edge and intermediate LSRs MUST support processing of 
          the LSP ATTRIBUTE object per Section 5.2. 
           
       7. Security Considerations 

          This document does not introduce any new security consideration 
          from the ones already detailed in [MPLS-SEC] that describes the 
          MPLS and GMPLS security threats, the related defensive 
          techniques, and the mechanisms for detection and reporting. 
          Indeed, the applicability of the proposed GMPLS extensions is 
          limited to single TE domain. Such a domain is under the 
          authority of a single administrative entity. In this context, 
          multiple switching layers comprised within such TE domain are 
          under the control of a single GMPLS control plane instance.  
            
          Nevertheless, Call initiation, as depicted in section 5.1, MUST 
          strictly remain under control of the TE domain administrator. 
          To prevent any abuse of Call setup, edge nodes MUST ensure 
          isolation of their call controller (i.e. the latter is not 
          reachable via external TE domains). To further prevent man-in-
          the-middle attack, security associations MUST be established 
          between edge nodes initiating and terminating calls. For this 
          purpose, IKE [RFC4306] MUST be used for performing mutual 
          authentication and establishing and maintaining these security 
          associations.
