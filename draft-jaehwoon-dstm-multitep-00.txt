Abstract

  Dual stack transition mechanism (DSTM) provides connectivity between
  dual stack hosts (i.e., DSTM client) within an IPv6-only network and
  IPv4 nodes within an IPv4 internet or intranet.
  DSTM defined in [DSTM] considers only
  one TEP, that is, packets from an IPv4 node to a DSTM client
  need to be routed through the same DSTM border router as that used in
  transmitting packets from the DSTM client to the IPv4 node.
  In this draft, we propose a DSTM architecture of using 
  multiple TEPs with only one IPv4 address pool for a DSTM domain.

1. Introduction

  
  Dual stack transition mechanism (DSTM) enables a dual stack host
  (i.e., DSTM client) within an IPv6 network to communicate with IPv4-
  only capable node within an IPv4 internet or intranet. DSTM defines
  a method to allocate a temporary IPv4 address to a DSTM client and
  provides the IPv4-over-IPv6 tunning in order to carry IPv4 traffic
  within an IPv6 network. DSTM architecture is composed of a number of
  DSTM clients, a DSTM server, and one or more DSTM border routers each
  having a Tunnel End Point (TEP). DSTM defined in [DSTM] assumes only 
  one TEP, that is, packets from an IPv4 node to a DSTM client should 
  be routed through the same TEP as that use in transmitting packets
  from the DSTM client to the IPv4 node. However, the mechanism has
  the drawback of the DSTM domain disconnection from an IPv4 internet
  in the case of the TEP failure. As an approach to overcome this
  deficiency, multiple TEPs each having a different IPv4 address pool
  can be used. However, this method has limitations like that
  each TEP should advertise different IPv4 address pool information
  to the IPv4 internet and optimal router may not be provided. In this
  draft, we propose the multiple TEP extension to DSTM so that traffic
  from a DSTM client to an IPv4 node and the reverse traffic from
  the IPv4 node to the DSTM client can be transmitted through
  different DSTM border routers (TEPs).

  Figure 1 A schematic overview of DSTM with the multiple TEP extension


  As an example, network address 1.0.0.0 is allocated as an IPv4 
  address pool for the DSTM domain in figure 1.
  The border router operates between a DSTM domain and an IPv4 
  internet and advertises the network address to an IPv4 internet
  in order to provide the reachability from the IPv4 internet.
  Routing within an IPv4 internet must ensure that
  IPv4 packets destined to the DSTM domain arrive at one or more
  TEPs within the DSTM domain.

  In order to communicate with an IPv4 node, a DSTM client asks
  the DNS for the A/AAAA RR for an IPv4 node. The answer of the
  DNS is the IPv4 address (type A) of the IPv4 node.
  
  The DSTM node queries the DSTM server in order to get a temporary 
  IPv4 global address and the IPv6 TEP address. On receiving the
  request, the DSTM server provides a temprary IPv4 address currently
  not used and the IPv6 address of a TEP (i.e., TEP1), and caches
  the information for the IPv6 address of the DSTM node and the IPv4
  address allocated to it.
  
  The IPv4 address allocated to the DSTM client is used as
  the source address of the IPv4 packets generated by the DSTM client.
  The DSTM client encapsulates an IPv4 packet and sends the 
  encapsulated IPv6 packet to a DSTM border router, BR1, defined by 
  the TEP1 address.
  
  BR1 decapsulates the packet, sends it to the IPv4 node, and caches 
  the IPv6/IPv4 addresses of the DSTM client.
  
  The IPv4 node answers, and the IPv4 packet may arrive at another
  DSTM borer router, BR2.

  BR2 checks the mapping information. If the destination IPv4 address
  exists in the informatioin, the router uses the mapping between IPv4
  and IPv6 addresses to tunnel the packet to the destination. 
  Otherwise, BR2 queries the DSTM server for the IPv6 address 
  corresponding to the IPv4 address allocated to the DSTM client.

  The DSTM server sends to BR2 the IPv6 address corresponding to the
  queried IPv4 address.
  
  BR2 caches the mapping information of the IPv6 and IPv4 addresses,
  encapsulates the IPv4 packet, and tunnels the packet to the DSTM
  client.

4.  Applicability statement

  Multiple TEP extension to DSTM, proposed in this draft, assumes
  only one DSTM server. At this time, it is beyond the scope of
  this proposal to consider multiple DSTM server as well as 
  synchronization of address mapping information between them.
  
  Mechanism in this proposal also assumes that the DSTM client provides
  its global IPv6 address to DSTM server when it queries
  for a temporary IPv4 address.
