Abstract

   A new type of BGP community attribute that contains communities that
   each hold a 4-octet AS number and a 8-octet opaque field is defined.

1.  Introduction

   A BGP Community attribute is defined that encodes 12 byte
   communities, suitable for 4-Octet Autonomous System Numbers that
   require 8 octets of locally significant opaque data.

   To ensure rapid and smooth adoption of the new community attribute,
   it must be as similar to the [RFC1997] community as possible, only
   bigger.

2.  Large BGP Community Attribute

   The Large Community Attribute is a transitive optional BGP attribute,
   with the Type Code (suggested 41) to be assigned by IANA.  The
   attribute consists of a set of "Large Communities".  All routes with
   the Large Community attribute belong to the communities listed in the
   attribute.

   Each Large Community is encoded as a 12-octet quantity, as follows:

3.  Textual Representation

   The textual representation of the Large BGP Community is A:B:C, where
   A is the Autonomous System number, B is the Local Data part 1 and C
   is the Local Data part 2.  A ranges from 0 to 4294967295.  B ranges
   from 0 to 4294967295.  C ranges from 0 to 4294967295.  A, B and C are
   plain decimal non-negative integers without leading zeroes.  Each
   number must appear, even if it is 0.  For example, "0:1:2" cannot be
   written as ":1:2".  The string is expected to match the following
   regular expression: ^[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+$

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a BGP path attribute value for the Large
   community attribute.
