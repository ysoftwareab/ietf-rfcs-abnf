1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
      1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
      called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC
      2580 [7].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
      called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
      The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
      described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2.  Conventions

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
   they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119 [23].


3.  Overview

   This MIB addresses the concept of inserting frame relay circuits into
   the ifTable.  There are multiple reasons to allow circuits to be
   added to the ifTable.  The most prevalent of which are the standard
   routing MIB tables such as the ipCidrRouteTable (IP-FORWARD-MIB) and
   the ipNetToMediaTable (IP-MIB) act on the ifIndex and the RMON MIBs
   (RMON-MIB and RMON2-MIB) require the use of an ifIndex a DataSource.

   This section provides an overview and background of how to use this
   MIB.


3.1.  Frame Relay Circuits

   The frame relay circuits are currently managed with one of two
   standards track MIBs: FRAME-RELAY-DTE-MIB (RFC 2115) [20] and the
   FRNETSERV-MIB (RFC 1604) [18]. These MIBs contain the ability to add
   or delete frame relay circuits as well as the statistics and other
   management objects.  However, they do not create ifIndex rows for the
   circuits.  The reason for this is that there are potentially multiple
   frame relay circuits and not every circuit needs to be managed as an
   individual interface.  For example, not every circuit on a device
   needs to be monitored with RMON and not every circuit needs to be
   included as an individual circuit for routing.  Further, the
   Interfaces Group MIB (RFC 2233) [17] strongly recommends that
   conceptual rows not be added to the ifTable for virtual circuits.

   The rationale for creating conceptual rows in the ifTable for frame
   relay circuits is that there is a need to both manage routing and
   monitor data on frame relay circuits.  Both of these functions
   require a mapping to an ifIndex.

   This MIB is designed such that only those circuits that require an
   ifIndex need be added to the ifTable.  This prevents over-populating
   the ifTable with useless or otherwise unused indices.

3.2.  Terminology


   o  DLCI - Data Link Connection Identifier. [18]

   o  Logical Port - This term is used to model the Frame Relay
      "interface" on a device. [18]



3.3.  Theory of Operation


3.3.1.  Creation Process

   In some cases, devices will automatically populate the rows of
   Circuit Table as circuits are created or discovered.  However, in
   many cases, it may be necessary for a network manager to manually
   create rows.

   Manual creation of rows requires the following steps:

   1)  Locate or create the circuit that is to be added on the device.

   2)  Create a row in the circuit table for each flow type that is
       required.

   The first step above requires some knowledge of the circuits that
   exist on a device.  Typically, logical ports have entries in the
   ifTable.  If the ifType for the logical port is frameRelay(32), the
   circuits can be located in the frCircuitTable of the Frame Relay DTE
   MIB (FRAME-RELAY-DTE-MIB) [18].  If the ifType for the logical port
   is frameRelayService(44), the circuits can be located in the
   frPVCEndptTable of the Frame Relay Service MIB (FRNETSERV-MIB) [20].
   An entry describing the circuit MUST exist in some table prior to
   creating a row in the circuit table.

3.3.2.  Destruction Process


3.3.2.1.  Manual Row Destruction

   Manual row destruction is straight forward.  Any row can be destroyed
   and the resources allocated to it are freed by setting the value of
   its status object (frciCircuitStatus) to destroy(6).  It should be
   noted that when frciCircuitStatus is set to destroy(6) all associated
   rows in the ifTable and in the interface map table will also be
   destroyed.  This process can trigger further row destruction in other

Internet Draft     Frame Relay Circuit Interface MIB       June 16, 2000


   tables as well.


3.3.2.2.  Automatic Row Destruction

   Rows in the tables may be destroyed automatically based on the
   existence of the circuit on which they rely.  When a circuit no
   longer exists in the device, the data in the tables has no relation
   to anything known on the network.  For this reason, rows MUST be
   removed from this table as soon as it is discovered that the
   associated circuits no longer exist.  The effects of automatic row
   destruction are the same as manual row destruction.


3.3.3.  Modification Process

   There are no objects that can be modified in this MIB.


4.  Relation to Other MIBs


4.1.  Frame Relay DTE MIB

   There is no explicit relation to the Frame Relay DTE MIB beyond the
   fact that a row in the frCircuitTable MAY be reference.


4.2.  Frame Relay Service MIB

   There is no explicit relation to the Frame Relay Service MIB beyond
   the fact that a row in the frPVCEndptTable MAY be referenced.


4.2.1.  Interfaces Group MIB


4.2.1.1.  Interfaces Table (ifTable, ifXtable)

   The following specifies how the Interfaces Group defined in the IF-
   MIB will be used for the management of interfaces created by this
   MIB.

   Values of specific ifTable objects for frame relay circuits are as
   follows:

   Object Name    Value of Object
   ===========    =====================================================

   ifIndex        Each entry in the circuit table is represented by an
                  ifEntry.  The value of ifIndex is defined by the agent
                  such that it complies with any internal numbering
                  scheme.

   ifType         The value for frame relay virtual circuits (??).

   ifMtu          Set to the maximum frame size in octets supported on
                  the circuit.

   ifSpeed        The peak bandwidth in bits per second available for
                  use.  This will equal either the ifSpeed of the
                  logical link if policing is not enforced or the
                  maximum information rate (Be / Tc) otherwise.

   ifPhysAddress  This will always be an octet string of zero length.

   ifInOctets     The number of octets received by the network (ingress)
                  for this circuit.  This counter should only count
                  octets from the beginning of the frame relay header
                  field to the end of user data. If the network
                  supporting Frame Relay can not count octets, then this
                  count should be a close approximation.

   ifInUcastPkts  The unerrored number of frames received by the network
                  (ingress) for this circuit.

   ifInDiscards   The number of received frames for this circuit
                  discarded due to ingress buffer congestion and traffic
                  policing.

   ifInErrors     The number of received frames for this circuit that
                  are discarded because of an error.

   ifOutOctets    The number of octets sent by the network (egress) for
                  this circuit.  This counter should only count octets
                  from the beginning of the frame relay header field to
                  the end of user data.  If the network supporting Frame
                  Relay can not count octets, then this count should be
                  an approximation.

   ifOutUcastpkts The number of unerrored frames sent by the network
                  (egress) for this circuit.

   ifOutDiscards  The number of frames discarded in the egress direction

                  for this circuit.  Possible reasons are as follows:
                  policing, congestion.

   ifOutErrors    The number of frames discarded for this circuit in the
                  egress direction because of an error.

   ifInBroadcastPkts
                  This variable is not applicable; therefore, this
                  counter is always zero.

   ifOutBroadcastPkts
                  This variable is not applicable; therefore, this
                  counter is always zero.

   ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable
                  Set to false(2).

   ifPromiscuousMode
                  Set to false(2).

   ifConnectorPresent
                  Set to false(2).

   All other values are supported as stated in the IF-MIB documentation.


4.2.1.2.  Stack Table (ifStackTable )

This section describes by example how to use ifStackTable to represent
the relationship between circuit and logical link interfaces.

Example: Circuits (C) on a frame relay logical link.

       | C |  | C |  | C |

           5     v34               (type 33)

   The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between each
   interface.

   In the above example the frame relay logical link could just as
   easily be
   of type frameRelay(32) instead.


5.  Structure of the MIB

   The FRCI-MIB consists of the following components:

   o  frciCircuitTable

   o  frciIfMapTable

   Refer to the compliance statement defined within for a definition of
   what objects MUST be implemented.

5.1.  frciCircuitTable

   The frciCircuitTable is the central control table for operations of
   the Frame Relay Circuit Interfaces MIB.  It provides a means of
   mapping a circuit to its ifIndex as well as forcing the insertion of
   an ifIndex into the ifTable.  The agent is responsible for managing
   the ifIndex itself such that no device dependent indexing scheme is
   violated.

   A row in this table MUST exist in order for a row to exist in any

             on the table that contains the circuit.  The index sub
             identifiers should uniquely define the circuit.

             The purpose of this object identifier is to point a
             network manager to the table in which the circuit was
             created as well as define the circuit on which the
             interface is defined.

            "The status of the current row.  This object is
             used to add, delete, and disable rows in this
             table.  When the status changes to active(1), a row
             will also be added to the interface map table below
             and a row will be added to the ifTable.  These rows
             SHOULD not be removed until the status is changed
             from active(1).  The value of ifIndex for the row that
             is added to the ifTable is determined by the agent
             and MUST follow the rules of the ifTable.  The value
             of ifType for that interface will be <?need ifType?>.

             When this object is set to destroy(6), the associated
             row in the interface map table will be removed and the
             ifIndex will be removed from the ifTable.  Removing
             the ifIndex MAY initiate a chain of events that causes
             changes to other tables as well.

             The rows added to this table MUST have a valid object
             identifier for frciCircuitObject.  This means that the

             that supports circuits.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
