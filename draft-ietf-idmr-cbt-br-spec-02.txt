Abstract

   This draft specifies the behaviour of a CBT multicast border router
   (BR).  This specification assumes the use of CBTv3 - the latest CBT
   protocol version [3].

   CBTv3 has capabilities which make CBT equally well suited for use in
   stub- or transit- domains; this draft describes mechanisms which
   enable a CBT distribution tree to span only those routers and links
   leading to interested receivers or receiver-domains.

1.  Changes from Previous Revision

   This draft differs significantly from previous revisions, and incor-
   porates mostly new procedures and mechanisms.



2.  Interoperability Model

   The interoperability model follows that described in [2]. Particular
   attention is drawn to sections 1 and 2 of that document. For brevity,
   some of the more fundamental aspects of interoperability are listed
   below:

+o    logically, a BR has at least two "components", each component being
     associated with a particular multicast routing protocol. Each com-
     ponent may have more than one associated interface which is running
     the particular multicast protocol associated with the component. At
     least one of these components is a CBT component. Figure 1 provides
     an example (logical) representation of a border router.

+o    besides a CBT component owning its own (private) forwarding cache
     (hereafter referred to as the PFC), all components share a common,
     protocol independent, multicast forwarding cache  (hereafter
     referred to as the SFC) which supports source specific (i.e (S,
     G)), and source independent (i.e. (*, G)) entries.  The latest CBT
     specification recommends that all CBT router implementations
     include support for an SFC, allowing any CBT router to assume the
     role of Border Router if necessary.

     A CBT component's PFC must support (*, G), (S, G), and (*, Core)
     entries; (*, Core) entries are not relevant to the SFC.

     To ensure that all components have a consistent view of the SFC a
     BR's components must be able to communicate with each other; how is
     implementation dependent (guidelines provided in [2]).

+o    the parent for all PFC entries shall point towards the local domain
     core for G. There is no notion of "incoming" interface wrt any PFC
     state.

     The semantics of the SFC cannot be stated until such time as the
     inter-domain multicast routing architecture is fully understood.

+o    It is suggested the SFC is only used on active CBT Border Routers;
     the PFC is used on all other CBT routers.

+o    mixed multicast protocol LANs are not permitted.

3.  Multicast ASs vs. Multicast Domains/"Regions"

   It is important to distinguish between a multicast Autonomous System
   (AS) - an AS whose unicast and multicast routing boundaries are
   aligned, and a multicast domain (or "region"), whose unicast and mul-
   ticast routing boundaries are not aligned.

   In the former case BGP-4 [6] is often deployed as a separator between
   interior and exterior routing. For multicast ASs BGP-4+ [1] is
   assumed, which allows a domain to express multicast policy, i.e.
   "come from" paths, as well as unicast policy, i.e. "go to" paths, for
   particular network addresses (or prefixes).  The advantage of BGP-4+
   is highlighted in the case where a multicast AS is multi-homed
   (multi-homed stub AS, or transit AS) - BGP-4+ has the ability to
   select a single ingress border router (BR) per external multicast
   source (network or prefix), thereby avoiding the potential for the
   very damaging effect of multicast packet duplicates being injected
   into a domain (or AS).

INTERNET-DRAFT      CBT Border Router Specification           March 1998


   Note that, if BGP-4+ is assumed, it must be deployed on all of an
   AS's BRs.

   In circumstances where BGP-4+ cannot be assumed, a single ingress BR
   for a particular multicast source (network or prefix) must be
   selected by alternate means. One alternative would be to manually
   configure a CBT domain's multicast BRs, but this does not scale for
   large numbers of BRs.  We therefore recommend that each of a CBT
   domain's BRs implement an "arbitration process" on each BR, responsi-
   ble for dynamically selecting a single ingress BR per multicast
   source (network or prefix).  This scheme arbitrates using (multicast)
   routing metrics as its BR selection criterium; its goal is to select
   a single ingress BR per external source, not replace BGP-4+ with its
   fine-grained policy expression capabilities.

   The resulting effect of the arbitration process is to allow a CBT
   component to potentially create/modify/delete a BR shared forwarding
   cache entry as necessary to prevent the injection of multicast dupli-
   cates inside the CBT domain.

   A description of one possible implementation of an "arbitration pro-
   cess" is provided in the Appendix.

   Hereafter, the terms "multicast domain" and "multicast AS" will be
   simply referred to as multicast "domain".



4.  The Architectural Model

   This section explains the overall architecture of a CBT multicast
   domain that attaches to other multicast domain(s).

+o    a CBT Border Router (BR) which is used to forward traffic towards
     an external receiver domain can be thought of as a group member wrt
     the CBT domain.

+o    Domain Wide Reports (DWRs) (see section 5) are used in a CBT domain
     so that BRs learn of internal group membership, and downstream
     domain group membership.

     DWRs need not necessarily be implemented in singly-homed stub CBT
     domains, at the potential cost of traffic flowing unnecessarily
     between the ingress BR and core router(s).

INTERNET-DRAFT      CBT Border Router Specification           March 1998


+o    DWRs are only sent by core routers. They are sent whenever a core
     router gets its first child, or when a core loses its last child.

     DWRs are distributed via the "all-cbt-border-routers" (ABR) multi-
     cast group, administratively scoped as 239.X.X.X. All CBT BRs must
     join this group at initialization time.

+o    CBT core routers have authoritative group membership information
     for the CBT domain for those groups for which they are the core.
     Hence, DWRs sent by core routers are authoritative - BRs use DWRs
     to decide whether or not to inject traffic into the CBT domain.

+o    CBT core routers also have authoritative group membership informa-
     tion wrt BRs' attached domain(s) - this is reflected in a core
     router's forwarding cache; BRs not interested in receiving traffic
     on behalf of a neighbouring domain send a QUIT_NOTIFICATION (prune)
     of the corresponding granularity towards the core router. Hence, a
     core router knows whether or not there are interested receivers
     downstream of it (internal or external).

+o    CBT BRs may issue (*, Core), (*, G), or (S, G) quits (prunes). In
     CBT, quits always instantiate uni-directional prune state; by send-
     ing a quit the BR is electing not to receive traffic via the CBT
     domain, but may inject externally sourced traffic into the CBT
     domain. A quit always follows the state that it is pruning -
     towards the core; if a quit reaches a core router, it is never for-
     warded beyond the core router.

+o    A BR may instantiate a priori state between itself and a core
     router, or that state may be explicitly invoked (see section 4.1
     below).  For the case where no a priori state exists between a BR
     and core router, if the BR receives externally sourced data and is
     the ingress BR for that data, if the BR has a cached DWR Join
     (received recently from a core router) the ingress BR instantiates
     (*, Core) (uni-directional) state between itself and the core,
     UNLESS the BR has appropriate pre-existing (*, G) or (S, G) state.
     This way, externally sourced data traffic can always be injected
     natively into the CBT domain.

+o    A join explicitly invoked by another BR component (as opposed to a
     DWR) - signalling that a neighbouring domain is interested in a
     group - instantiates bi-directional state between the BR and core
     (otherwise data would not be "pulled down" to the BR). This state
     may be (*, Core), (*, G), or (S, G).

INTERNET-DRAFT      CBT Border Router Specification           March 1998


In each of the following two sections we look at the procedures followed
by two different circumstances: firstly, when a BR's neighbouring domain
is able to explicitly signal its group membership, and secondly, when a
BR's neighbouring domain cannot (or cannot to the same degree compared
to the first case) explicitly signal group membership.



4.1.  A Neighbouring Domain can Explitly Signal Group Membership


+o    CBT BR's send (*,G), (S,G), or (*, Core) JOIN_REQUESTs towards the
     relevant core router when a neighbouring domain has group members,
     i.e. a join-alert is received by the CBT BR component from another
     BR component. The resulting state is bi-directional.

+o    CBT BR's send (*,G), (S,G), or (*, Core) QUIT_NOTIFICATIONs towards
     the relevant core router when the neighbouring domain no longer has
     group members, i.e. a prune-alert is received by the CBT component
     from another BR component.

+o    When a core router gets its first child or loses its last child it
     issues a DWR of the corresponding granularity. This is received by
     all BR's; as a result, the BRs know whether or not to inject exter-
     nally sourced traffic.



4.2.  A Neighbouring Domain cannot Explitly Signal Group Membership


+o    CBT BR's instantiate (*,Core) state at initialization time to all
     core routers in a CBT domain that are associated with inter-domain
     scoped groups. The resulting state is bi-directional.

+o    Though a neighbouring BR component might not be explicitly informed
     of group membership inside its domain, it may still send prune-
     alerts (e.g. DVMRP) to the CBT component. Upon receiving a prune-
     alert from another component, the CBT component sends a (*, G), (S,
     G), or (*, Core) QUIT_NOTIFICATION (prune) towards the relevant
     core.  Since a quit (prune) is always uni-directional, the BR - if
     ingress for some external sources - is still able to inject exter-
     nally sourced data into the CBT domain.

+o    Though a neighbouring BR component might not be explicitly informed
     of group membership inside its domain, it may still send join-
     alerts (e.g. DVMRP) to the CBT component. Upon receiving a join-
     alert from another component, the CBT component sends a (*, G) (or
     (S, G)) JOIN_REQUEST toward the relevant core, UNLESS there exists
     appropriate non-pruned less specific state, i.e. (*, Core).  The
     resulting state is bi-directional.



4.3.  Architectural Summary

   In the context of multicast domain interconnection, a CBT domain
   exhibits the following attributes:

+o    if at least one of a BR's neighbouring domains cannot explicitly
     signal group membership, the BR must instantiate a priori (*, Core)
     state (bi-directional) between itself and each domain core.

+o    if all of a BR's neighbouring domains can explicitly signal group
     membership, the BR need not instantiate any state between itself
     and domain cores until group membership is signalled.

+o    if a BR receives a DWR Join from a domain core, the DWR is cached.
     If, during the DWR cache lifetime data arrives for a member group
     and the BR is the ingress BR for that data, the BR instantiates
     uni-directional (*, Core) state between itself and the core so the
     data can be injected into the CBT domain natively, UNLESS there
     exists appropriate (*, G) or (S, G) state.  A BR may explicitly
     tear down (using a quit message) uni-directional (*, Core) state
     after a suitable data flow idle period, or the state may remain.

+o    if a BR receives a DWR Leave from a domain core, the DWR is cached.
     A DWR Leave results in BRs with any (*, G) or (S,G) PFC (bi-direc-
     tional) states pruning the relevant state by sending a quit mes-
     sage. The BR also removes the appropriate interface from its SFC
     entry. An ingress BR which is receiving traffic for the now pruned
     group (injecting it using (*,Core) state) either tears down the
     one-way (*, Core) state, or marks its parent PFC as pruned; this is
     the ONLY instance of a parent interface being pruned.

5.  Domain Wide Reports (DWRs)

   Domain Wide Reports (DWRs) are used in a CBT domain to enable BRs to
   learn - in a dynamic and timely fashion - of internal group member-
   ship, and downstream domain group membership.  Group member-
   ship/absence is indicated by means of DWR Join and Leave messages,
   respectively.

   It is assumed DWRs are refreshed periodically, and cached by receiv-
   ing BRs for a lifetime of X seconds, after which time they expire in
   the BR's DWR cache.

   If DWRs are in use in a CBT domain, they are only ever issued by core
   routers. DWRs issued by core routers are authoritative.

   DWRs can be source-group specific (S, G), or source independent (*,
   G).

   A DWR represents aggregated state where possible. For example, if a
   core has only one child for each of its (*, G) and (S, G) states, it
   generates a (*, G) DWR to cover (*, G) and (S, G).  Finer grained
   aggregates may be represented if DWRs support mask information.

   The DWR processing rules are as follows:

+o    whenever a CBT component receives an (S,G) DWR Join message it is
     only processed by the ingress BR for S. If there exists no (S, G)
     SFC entry at the ingress BR, an (S, G) SFC entry is created by the
     CBT component, and an (S, G) Creation-Alert is generated. Then (or
     if an (S, G) entry already exists) the interface via which the DWR
     originating core router is reachable is added (or un-pruned) in the
     entry's child list.  If this interface is the only interface in the
     child list of the entry, the CBT component generates an (S, G)
     Join-Alert.

     If the CBT component's PFC does not have equal- or less specific
     state that includes the same interface, a (*, G) JOIN_REQUEST
     (including the "uni-directional" join option) is sent over the
     interface towards the domain core for G. [An (S,G) join is not sent
     because (S,G) state does not exist between the ingress BR and core
     router].

+o    whenever a CBT component receives an (S,G) DWR Leave message it is
     processed only by the ingress BR for S. If the ingress BR for S has
     an equal- or less specific SFC entry that includes a pruned

     outgoing interface corresponding to that leading to the relevant
     domain core router, no further action need be taken.

     Otherwise, an (S, G) SFC entry is created (causing an (S, G) Cre-
     ation-Alert), and the interface leading to the relevant domain core
     router is included in the outgoing interface list and marked as
     pruned.

     If no further non-pruned children remain in the (S, G) SFC child
     list, the CBT component sends an (S, G) Prune-Alert to the entry's
     owner.

+o    whenever a CBT component receives a (*, G) DWR Join, a (*, G) SFC
     entry is created (unless it, or a less specific entry, already
     exists) and the interface leading to the domain core for G is added
     as a child in the entry. The CBT component's PFC is checked to
     ensure the same interface belongs to an equal- or less specific
     entry. If no such entry exists, the CBT component sends a (*, G)
     JOIN_REQUEST (uni-directional) towards the domain core for G,
     instantiating (*, G) PFC state.

+o    When a DWR (*, G) Leave message is received by a CBT component if
     no (*, G) SFC entry exists one is created, and the interface lead-
     ing to the relevant domain core router is added as a child and
     marked as pruned.

     If no more non-pruned (*, G) SFC children remain, the CBT component
     sends an (*, G) Prune-Alert to the entry's owner.



6.  More BR Component Interactions


+o    upon receipt of an (S,G) Join-Alert (see [2]) by a CBT component,
     if the interface towards the domain core for G is owned by the CBT
     component, it adds the interface as the (S, G) SFC entry's incoming
     interface.

     If the CBT component's PFC has no equal- or less specific state
     that includes the same interface, an (S, G) JOIN_REQUEST is sent
     over the interface towards G.

+o    the receipt of a (*,G) Join-Alert (see [2]) by a CBT component
     results in the CBT component including the interface leading to the

     relevant domain core as the parent in the (*, G) SFC entry.  The
     CBT component's PFC is checked to ensure the same interface belongs
     to an equal- or less specific entry. If no such entry exists the
     CBT component sends a (*, G) JOIN_REQUEST towards the domain core
     for G, instantiating (*, G) PFC state.

+o    upon receipt of an (S,G) Prune-Alert (see [2]) by a CBT component,
     if the next-hop interface towards the domain core for G is owned by
     the CBT component, the CBT component removes the interface from the
     (S, G) SFC entry, and an (S, G) QUIT_NOTIFICATION is sent towards
     the domain core for G, instantiating (S, G) PFC prune state.

+o    the receipt of an (*,G) Prune-Alert (see [2]) by a CBT component
     causes the CBT component to remove the interface leading to the
     relevant domain core from the (*, G) SFC entry, then send a (*,G)
     QUIT_NOTIFICATION over that interface.

+o    whenever a more specific PFC entry is created and there exists a
     less specific entry/entries, the child list of the new entry is the
     union of the less specific entry/entries child list(s). The child
     list of the new entry must also include the interface over which
     the triggering control message was received.



7.  Tunnel Issues

   IP multicast deployment in the Internet is a slow process. A unicast
   AS may not have the resources, or it may not be practical, to migrate
   a complete AS into one that is completely multicast capable (i.e.
   multicast AS), so multicast "islands" (i.e. multicast domains - see
   section 3) may be created within the unicast AS infrastructure as
   part of a longer term migration strategy.

   A shortage of resources may mean that core routers must be shared
   between any multicast domains, implying that, from the perspective of
   the Bootstrap Mechanism [5], multiple multicast domains may be seen
   as one single domain.  Configured (IP-in-IP) tunnels provide multi-
   cast connectivity between the multicast domain "islands".

   Under these circumstances the Bootstrap Mechanism operating within
   each multicast domain must be modified such that, if the core router
   for some set of groups belongs to another domain, the local domain
   tunnel end-point advertises ("proxies") itself as the core router for
   that set of groups.  The tunnel end-point (router) simply acts as a

APPENDIX


The BR "Arbitration Process"

   The specific details of the arbitration process (AP) are implementa-
   tion dependent, but we provide an outline of its possible operation
   for reference.

   The AP is applicable to any multi-homed (stub or transit) CBT domain
   whose BRs have not deployed BGP-4+ [1].  The goal of the arbitration
   process is to allow CBT BRs attached to a CBT domain to select a sin-
   gle ingress BR per external multicast source in a timely fashion.  A
   diagram showing the arbitration process in a CBT BR component is
   shown in figure 2.

        Figure 5: Logical Representation of the Arbitration Process


   The arbitration process is only triggered by externally sourced pack-
   ets, i.e. those passed to a CBT component interface by the BR process
   that handles SFC forwarding); the AP is not triggered by data packets
   arriving from inside the CBT domain.

   All of a CBT domain's BRs are joined to the "all-CBT-border-routers"
   (ABR) multicast group (see section 4), the group address for which is
   domain-scoped, 239.X.X.X.  This group is used both by the arbitration
   process, and by CBT transit domains for propogating multicast routing

   information (in cases where multicast topology discovery is neces-
   sary).

   Whenever a CBT component receives an externally sourced data packet
   for the first time (since some time 't-zero') the CBT component arbi-
   tration process is invoked.

   The arbiter queries the BR component owning the interface via which
   the externally sourced data packet arrived, i.e. the component owning
   the interface nearest to S, to find out that component's current
   (multicast) metric for S. The arbiter multicasts an (S, G, metric,
   protocol component) tuple - where protocol component is DVMRP, PIM-
   DM, etc. - to the ABR group, and the message is processed by each
   receiving CBT component arbitration process.  The receiving
   arbiter(s) cache the received tuple.

   The unsolicited arrival of a triple triggers the receiving arbiter to
   reply with its own corresponding tuple; those CBT components not
   receiving the (S,G) multicast data simply reply with a NULL tuple,
   where "metric" and "protocol component" are both NULL. Failure to
   receive a reply from each other BR belonging to the ABR group results
   in the tuple being resent (unicast, unless no reply is forthcoming
   from any BR) after 3 (??) seconds.

   The receipt of a non-NULL tuple with a better metric for S than this
   BR's tuple (for the same protocol), or an equal metric but sent by a
   lower-addressed BR, causes the arbiter to instigate the removal of
   the CBT component interface from the relevant SFC entry's child list.

   The subsequent arrival of data packets from S are injected into the
   CBT domain via a single BR, with the same packets arriving at any of
   the other BRs being filtered. The arrival of subsequent data packets
   does not result in any exchanges between BR arbiters for the lifetime
   of the relevant cache entry's timeout period, which must be synchro-
   nised across all of the domain's BRs (recommended lifetime, X secs).

   Whilst this method does not guarantee against multicast duplicates
   being injected into the CBT domain, it should ensure that any dupli-
