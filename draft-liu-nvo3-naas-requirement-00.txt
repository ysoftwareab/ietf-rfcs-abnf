  1. Introduction

   CDC (Cloud Data Center) network has the fastest innovation of the
   network standards and the most proposed technology.  Especially in
   the public clouds.  From our perspective, there are several network
   capacity can be sold by public clouds' operator: IP address, VLAN,
   bandwidth, load balance, firewall and some other network resources.
   The target of NaaS (network as a service) is to provide end to end
   virtual network with above capacity for tenants in cloud datacenter.

   However, many traditional technology become the bottleneck of public
   cloud service, such as the number of VLAN.  It becomes unable to
   meet the constantly updated needs of providing users with the hosted
   networks for the data segregation.

   In this draft, we focus on proposing network requirement of NaaS in
   datacenter.

  2. Requirement

   NaaS is supposed to provide a virtual CDC network for a tenant. We
   propose several specific network features of NaaS as follows.

2.1. Isolation of different tenants

   Different tenants are isolated by VPN, No matter layer 2 or layer 3,
   no matter by VLAN tag or MPLS tag or some others. Meanwhile, the
   network service devices, such as load balance and firewall, also
   need to be isolated. Tenants have a logical isolated network, which
   can be implement any IP and VLAN by themselves (different tenants
   should reused IP/VLAN).

2.2. Tenant's logical network in GUI

   Tenant's logical network GUI should be simple and intuitive. For
   example it only display a L2 switch, a L3 gateway, a broader router,
   a load balance, a firewall and some other security devices.  All the
   link is logical. VMs or servers connect to these logical network
   devices.

2.3. Bandwidth guarantee

   Each logical network should allocate the specific end to end
   bandwidth, including server uplink switch port rate, switch to
   gateway link rate, gateway to LB/FW link rate and broader router
   link rate. In addition, as tenants in CNC need to establish VPN
   connection with its own research, it need to guarantee the VPN
   bandwidth as well to realize end-to-end QoS. All the logical
   bandwidth allocation should map in physical network devices.

2.4. Network management

   Each tenant should be able to manage and configure their own logical
   network. For example tenant can maintain its own logical firewall
   policy. Tenant's control policy should be isolated from underlay
   network architecture and can the transformation from policy to rule
   by a middle-box controller. Meantime  In order to improve the

   ability of rapid deployment and decrease the difficulty of tenant
   management as well, it also need to provide automatic extension,
   automatic configuration function.

2.5. Reliability

   It is important for NaaS reliability. By distributed VDC, disaster
   tolerance, resource pool HA, smart TE and other measure is required
   to provide higher reliability.

2.6. Service function requirement

   NaaS can provide two kinds of services for tenants, public cloud
   service and private cloud service. The public cloud service means
   tenants use CDC resources to provide services for internet users;
   the private cloud service provide tenants CDC resources to host
   services for themselves. The public cloud services include public
   IP, bandwidth, firewall, load balance, CDN, etc. The private
   services include DHCP, DNS, subnet gateway, VPN, etc.

   Public IP services: provide IP address for the computing resources
   in CDC access by internet users.

   Bandwidth services: provide a guaranteed public network bandwidth
   for tenants' internet services.

   Firewall services: provide the tenant with self-defined security
   policies.

   Load balance: provide tenants with CDC's computing resources which
   have parallel service abilities.

   CDN: provide cache services for tenants across different geographic
   area, the goal of a CDN are to serve content to end-users with high
   availability and high performance.

   DHCP services: allocate IP addresses dynamically to the computing
   resources applied in CDC for tenants.

   DNS services: resolute domain name which user will access, include
   the internet domain and the IT domain of local tenants.

   Subnet gateway services: allowing tenants to define the range of
   subnet which the CDC's computing resources belong to, it can also
   provide reciprocal visits between different computing resources,
   access external internet and routing function of VPN.

   VPN services: used in the connection between tenants' CDC resources
   and tenants' other resources (such as branches); sometimes in order
   to improve the quality of service, it will use a dedicated line to
   realize the VPN. So tenants will send and receive data across shared
   or public networks as if it were directly connected to the private
   network, while benefiting from the functionality, security and
   management policies of the private network.

2.7. Performance requirements

   NaaS need to support million level tenants, so it has some specific
   requirements.

2.7.1. Million-level tenants support

     By using the overlay network (eg NVO3), it will expand the number
     of tenants support by the network and enhance network resource
     multiplexing capabilities.

2.7.2. Millisecond level service response

   Multi-tenant lead to high concurrency of NaaS, so the service
   response determine the quality of service. Service response need to
   be Millisecond level.

2.7.3. Tenants line speed bandwidth

   Tenant's bandwidth can reaches NIC's line speed. After using NaaS,
   the proportion of CDC's internal flow will increase. NaaS have to
   ensure tenants' internal data bandwidth.

  3. Security Considerations

   TBD

  4. IANA Considerations

   The draft does not require any IANA action.
