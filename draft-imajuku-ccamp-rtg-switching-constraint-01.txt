Abstract

   This document proposes routing extensions in support of carrying
   switching constraint information in corresponding link state
   information for Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GM
PLS).
   With the proposed extension, GMPLS routing protocols can handle
   network elements with blocking switch architecture.

1.  Introduction

   The routing protocol extensions so far have been developed for
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Switching (GMPLS)[OSPF-TE],[GMPLS-ROUTING],
   [GMPLS-OSPF]. This document further enhances the routing extensions
   required to support GMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) over network
   element
s with blocking switch architecture.

   A reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (ROADM) is a network
   element that employs the blocking switch architecture widely used in
   commercialized networks. The ROADM has switching constraints with
   respect to selecting the direction when adding/dropping a lambda path
   from/to a tributary port. The lambda path added from each tributary
   port is restricted to either east or west of the ROADM ring. 
   Similarly, the dropping of a lambda path connected to the tributary 
   port also has a constraint with respect to the selection of the
   tributary port.

   The objective of this document is to enhance the routing protocol
   such that it supports the carrying of switching constraint
   information pertaining to the network elements with blocking switch
   architecture. The constraint information of each switch is carried
   within the link state information of Traffic Engineering (TE) links.

3.  Problem Statements

3.1.  Problem Statements

   Many lambda switch capable (LSC) nodes such as ROADM and Optical
   Cross-Connects (OXC) employ the blocking switch architecture to reduce
   the cost of the switch fabric or wavelength converters. In particular,
   the ROADM, which was already commercially deployed, employs a unique
   switch architecture that has a constraint with respect to the TE link
   selectivity, while the OXC without wavelength converters has a
   constraint with respect to wavelength label selectivity.

   For the wavelength label selectivity constraint, GMPLS has a
   specification to control the label allocation mechanism for Label
   Switch Paths (LSPs) based on the signaling mechanis
m [RFC3471], 
   [RFC3473]. On the contrary, for the TE link selectivity constraint,
   there is currently no specification. 

   To address this issue regarding the TE link selectivity constraint,
   it is clear that an extension to the GMPLS routing mechanism is 
   essential for all network elements in a domain in order to understand
   which TE link can be selected to forward LSPs at the network elements
   that have the constraint.

3.2.  Problem Example

   Figure shows a typical example using ROADM systems and ROADM ring
   network architecture to illustrate the TE link selectivity constraint.
   In this example, we assume that each ROADM switches optical signals
   (LSPs) transparently and a ROADM system comprises four tributary
   interfaces, i.e., w1, w2, e1, and e2. Lambda LSPs from TE-Wx can only
   be dropped to w1 or w2, and lambda LSPs can only be added from e1 and e2,
   if these LSPs are forwarded to TE-Ex. Similarly, lambda LSPs 
from TE-Ex
   can only be dropped from e1 or e2, and lambda LSPs can only be added
   from w1 and w2 if these LSPs are forwarded to TE-Wx. Thus, the ports
   for each ROADM are grouped into "west" and "east" ports from the
   viewpoint of TE link selectivity.

   In a ring network using ROADM systems, a lambda LSP added from a west
   tributary port cannot be dropped to a "west" tributary port at another
   node, and this is als
o true for the “east” bound case.
   For example, a lambda LSP added from tributary port w1 of ROADM #1
   cannot be dropped to tributary port w1 or w2 of ROADM #2, #3, or #4.
   Similarly, a lambda LSP added from tributary port e1 of ROADM #1
   Cannot be dropped to tributary port e1 or e2 of ROADM #2, #3, or #4.

3.3. Comments on Necessity of Extension

   The problem described in the previous section is not so critical if
   the network comprises a single ROADM ring network. In such a case,
   the routing of LSPs can be performed based on static routing without
   using any routing protocols. Assignment of a destination node ID
   with a loose option in the Explicit Route Object (ERO) of the
   signaling message and execution of loose hop expansion [RFC3209]
   in each ROADM may result in successfully establishing an LSP.

   Employing an inter-domain routing architecture can also be a
   solution [per-domain-calc]. By separating ROADM rings from a GMPLS
   routing domain, the nodes o
utside the ROADM domain assign a ROADM

draft-imajuku-ccamp-rtg-switching-constraint-01.txt          October 2006


   node ID or boundary node adjacent to the ROADM domain with a loose
   ERO to forward the Lambda LSP. Then, each ROADM node performs loose
   hop expansion to forward the lambda LSP toward the destination. 

   The case that essentially requires an extension of the GMPLS routing
   mechanism is the case in which the ROADM and other Lambda or Fiber
   Switch capable nodes co-exist in the same routing domain. Packet and
   TDM switch capable nodes attached to such a domain must also consider
   the TE link selectivity constraint at the ROADM nodes when creating a
   Lambda LSP.

4.  Proposal for GMPLS Routing Enhancement

4.1. Possible Routing Enhancement

   This section proposes advertising the TE link selectivity constraint
   as a solution. The ex
tended sub-TLVs indicate the list of selectable
   and/or unselectable TE links from the TE link indicated in sub-TLV
   Type 2 (Link ID).

   The possible extensions to sub-TLV are described below.

   Sub-TLV Type      Length    Name
            TBD    variable    Selectable numbered TE link list
            TBD    variable    Unselectable numberd TE link list
            TBD    variable    Selectable unnumberd TE link list
            TBD    variable    Unselectable unnumberd TE link list

4.2. Comments on Other Possible Solutions 

   Employing a virtual TE link model as discussed in L1-VPN WG is also
   a possible solution [l1-vpn-frwk]. An optical network domain that
   has a switching constraint can be modeled as an abstract mesh network.
   Note that this routing architecture requires a hierarchical routing
   mechanism in each border node of the optical network domain. Also,
   note that it is essential to share switching constraint information
   pertaining to each node within the optical network domain in order for
   the border nodes to advertise the virtual TE links to other network
   domains.

5.  Compatibility Iss
ues

   There should be no interoperability issues with routers that do not
   implement these extensions, as the Opaque LSAs will be silently
   ignored.

   The result of having routers that do not implement these extensions
   is that the traffic engineering topology will be missing pieces.
   However, if the topology is connected, TE paths can still be
   calculated and ought to work.
