Internet-Draft  VWRAP : Client Application Launch Message      July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Web authentication protocols such as OpenID [OPENID] and web
   authorization protocols such as OAuth [RFC5849] are of increasing
   interest to the internet community.  They have great utility in web-
   based application environments.  Best practice for their use in
   conjunction with applications that do not expose a HTML rendering
   interface is less clear.  Virtual World (VW) client applications, for
   instance, are often implemented as "desktop applications" instead of
   "web apps".  This introduces difficulty in using web based
   authentication and authorization protocols to initiate a virtual
   world session.

   OpenID and OAuth traditionally use a HTTP redirect [RFC2616] after
   user or token authentication to begin an authorized session with a
   web application.  The problem in using desktop applications with "web
   auth" technologies is that desktop applications do not generally have
   a URL to act as the target of HTTP redirection.

   One possible solution to this problem is to register a unique MIME
   type [RFC2046] with the user's web browser and following successful
   user or token authentication, redirect the user's web browser to a
   resource with that MIME type.  Upon receipt of such a resource, a
   properly configured web browser could then launch the client desktop
   application.

   This document describes the format of a web resource suitable for
   signaling the user's web browser to launch a virtual world client
   application that uses Virtual World Region Agent Protocol (VWRAP)
   Authentication [I-D.ietf-vwrap-authentication] to establish a session
   between the client application and network resources implementing the
   virtual world.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  The VWRAP Client Application Launch Message Format

   The Client Application Launch message is an LLSD
   [I-D.ietf-vwrap-type-system] message, defined by the LLIDL below, but
   is identified with a unique MIME type (described below.)  It may be
   transmitted in XML, JSON or Binary format, at the web server's
   convenience.  Compliant client applications SHOULD support XML, JSON
   and Binary serialization formats.

   ; note that the &request defined here uses named type &authenticator
   ; which is defined in draft-ietf-vwrap-authentication-00

   &request = {
     authenticator : &authenticator,
     account_name : string,
     loginurl : uri,
     region : uri
   }

   %% launch_request << &request

   Figure 1 : VWRAP Client Application Launch Message


3.  Message Flow

   The VWRAP Client Application Launch Message is intended to be sent by
   a web server to a web browser following successful authentication.
   Requirements for web authentication are explicitly not defined in
   this document, and left as a responsibility of the authenticating web
   service.

   Two techniques for processing a client application launch message are
   defined.  The first requests a one time "single use only" secret from
   an agent domain.  This secret is used to authenticate the client to
   the agent domain.  The second technique uses possession of a web
   capability to authenticate the client.  The message flow for both
   techniques is the same.

   Figure 2 below shows message flows between four conceptual entities.
   It is provided for expository purposes only; implementers may choose
   to combine conceptual entities into fewer reified components.  That
   is, nothing in this specification should be interpreted to require
   four distinct, deployed entities.

   Figure 2 : Message Flow For Client Application Launch Requests

   0. Registering MIME types as Web Browser Helper Applications

       The technique defined in this document depends on the traditional
       web browser capability to define a "helper application" when the
       browser receives a MIME type it cannot handle itself.  Compliant
       VWRAP Client Applications SHOULD register themselves as the
       helper application for the three MIME types listed in IANA
       Considerations (Section 5) below.

       The exact technique used to register the client application with
       the VWRAP Client Application Launch Message is beyond the scope
       of this document.

   1. Web Client to Web Server Authentication / Authorization

       The process of launching an VWRAP client application using a web
       based authentication or authorization system begins with
       successful user authentication or token authentication.  It is
       traditional in these systems for the user's web browser to be
       redirected to a web based application following authentication.
       This document assumes the user's web browser will instead be
       redirected to an HTTP or HTTPS URI that will eventually respond
       with a Client Application Launch Message.

       The exact nature of the web-based authentication or authorization
       scheme used is beyond the scope of this document.

   2. One Time Password or LoginURL Capability Request

       Before the web service responsible for communicating the launch
       message to the user's web browser may download the message, it
       must first request a "single use only" shared secret or the

Internet-Draft  VWRAP : Client Application Launch Message      July 2010


       LoginURL web capability.

       The exact mechanism for this request is beyond the scope of this
       document.  However, the request from the authentication service
       to the agent domain SHOULD contain an account or avatar name
       known to the agent domain and SHOULD be communicated over a
       secure channel.

   3. One Time Password or LoginURL Capability Response

       The agent domain responds with a One Time Password or web
       capability.  If the one time password is used, the password
       SHOULD be a sequence of unguessable octets, thought the exact
       encoding and transport of the request is beyond the scope of this
       document.

   4. Client Application Launch Download

       After the One Time Password or web capability is passed from the
       agent domain to the authorization service, it is included in the
       Client Application Launch Message along with an account or avatar
       identifier, a login URI for the agent domain and an initial
       region URI indicating the avatar's initial location in the
       virtual world.

   5. Web Browser Launches Client Application

       When the user's web browser receives the Client Application
       Launch Message, it forwards the contents of the message AND the
       message's MIME type to the registered Client Application.

   6. VWRAP Authentication

       In response to receipt of the Client Application Launch Message,
       the client application uses the information in the message to
       begin the VWRAP Authentication process and initial placement of
       the user's avatar in the virtual world.


4.  Processing Expectations

   When a client application receives a client application launch
   message, it is expected to request a seed capability from the service
   endpoint from in the loginurl specified in message.  The loginurl is
   expected to identify the service endpoint for an agent_login resource
   defined in the VWRAP Trust Model and User Authentication
   [I-D.ietf-vwrap-authentication] specification.  The client SHOULD
   pass the &authenticator and account_name map entries to the

   agent_login resource unaltered.


5.  IANA Considerations

   In accordance with [RFC5226], this document registers the following
   mime types:

       application/calm+xml

       application/calm+json

       application/calm+binary

   See the MIME Type Registrations section (Section 6) below for
   detailed information on MIME Type registrations.


6.  MIME Type Registrations

   This section provides media-type registration applications (as per
   RFC 4288 [RFC4288].)

   Subject: Registration of media type application/calm+xml

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: calm+xml

   Required Parameters: none

   Optional Parameters: none

   Encoding Considerations:  The Extensible Markup Language (XML)
       specification allows for the use of multiple character sets.  The
       character set used to encode the body of the message is defined
       as part of the XML header.  If no character set is indicated in
       the XML header, compliant systems MUST assume UTF-8.  When
       encoding binary data using RFC 4648 [RFC4648], characters outside
       the base alphabet are explicitly allowable and should be ignored.

   Security Considerations:  The VWRAP Client Application Launch Request
       Message contains sensitive information.  Compliant systems SHOULD

       the web authentication service and the VWRAP agent domain as well
       as that between the web authentication service and the user's web
       browser.

   Interoperability Considerations:  While it is possible for compliant
       implementations to specify the use of character sets other than
       UTF-8, such systems MUST accept UTF-8 input and SHOULD generate
       UTF-8 output.

   Required Parameters: none

   Optional Parameters: none

   Encoding Considerations: LLSD Binary Serialization REQUIRES the use
   of binary content-transfer-encoding  Section 5 of RFC 2045 [RFC2045]
       describes the binary Content-Transfer-Encoding header field.
       This specification REQUIRES the use of this header to alert
       intermediary systems that information being included in the
       message should be interpreted as binary data with no end-of-line
       semantics which could be considerably longer than allowed in an
       RFC 821 transport.

   Security Considerations:  The VWRAP Client Application Launch Request
       Message contains sensitive information.  Compliant systems SHOULD
       ensure the confidentiality of the communications media between

7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for this specification are, fortunately,
   either simple or beyond the scope of this document.  RFC 3552
   [RFC3552] describes several aspects to use when evaluating the
   security of a specification or implementation.  The authors believe
   most common security concerns users of this specification will
   encounter are more appropriately considered as transport, network or
   link layer issues.  Or, as higher level "application security"
   issues.
