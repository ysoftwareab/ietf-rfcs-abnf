Abstract 
    
   A variety of technologies are available to network appliances and 
   provide home automation and control.  However, these do not support 
   wide-area access control and interworking of these Networked 
   Appliances (NA).  This document describes a new SIP method, DO, that 
   allows a SIP UA to communicate with NAs. 
    
    
1. Introduction 
    
   There are numerous technologies for networking and controlling 
   appliances within a home.  Some examples are X.10 [6], OSGi [1], HAVi 
   [2], VHN [3], and UPnP [4].  However, there is currently no support 
   for wide-area access communication or control of these Networked

   Appliances (NAs) from the Internet, or for interworking the various 
   home networking technologies.  The ability to provide such support 
   will radically enhance the ability to provide exciting new services 
   [10][11]. 
    
   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (RFC 2543) [7] is an ideal 
   protocol for supporting wide-area communication and interworking of 
   NAs.  SIP, as defined in the RFC, meets many of the requirements [11] 
   for communicating with NAs:  security, authentication, reliability, 
   scalability, universal addressing, support for call setup, and 
   personal mobility. 
    
   This document describes a new SIP method ÊDO∆ for enabling wide-area 
   communication between user agents and NAs.  The DO method carries 
   messages or requests for NAs in the body of the DO request, and 
   delivers it into the home environment where the message or request is 
   rendered. The method does not result in a session set up, and can be 
   used within or without an existing session.  Examples of DO use 
   include: sending application requests to NAs, updating NA 
   information, and querying the status of NAs. 
    
   It should be noted that DO can be used in conjunction with other SIP 
   methods to support wide-area communication between NAs.  However, 
   this draft focuses only on the definition and use of DO. 
    
    
2. Terminology 
    
   In this document, the key words ÊMUST∆, ÊMUST NOT∆, ÊREQUIRED∆, 
   ÊSHALL∆, ÊSHALL NOT∆, ÊSHOULD∆, ÊSHOULD NOT∆, ÊRECOMMENDED∆, ÊMAY∆, 
   and ÊOPTIONAL∆ are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and 
   indicate requirement levels for the protocol.

   The key components of the architecture are now described. 
    
   Residential     The RGW provides IP connectivity outside of the home 
   Gateway (RGW):  environment.  All external access to the home will 
                   be made through the RGW.  The RGW will provide a SIP 
                   proxy for handling SIP requests and responses 
                   to/from the home.  Additionally, the RGW may provide 
                   firewall and network address translator (NAT)

                   functions. 
   Appliance       The appliance controller enables non-IP devices 
   Controller:     (e.g., X.10) to be controlled from an IP network.  
                   It provides interworking between the IP local area 
                   network and the non-IP devices.  The Appliance 
                   Controller comprises a SIP UA and a device 
                   controller, and performs SIP to device protocol 
                   interworking.   
   Lamp:           The lamp is an example of a non-IP appliance.  It is 
                   controlled by the user on an IP network through the 
                   Appliance Controller. 
   Other           Other appliances will be connected in the home 
   Appliance:      environment.  This one uses a SIP UA to allow users 
                   to control it from the wide-area IP network. 
   User:           A user controls NAs in the home environment over a 
                   wide-area IP network via a SIP UA. 
   Location        The location server is a database which provides the 
   Server:         SIP proxy with information on how to route incoming 
                   or outgoing SIP messages. 
   IP local area   The IP local area network in the home network 
   network:        environment connects together the RGW, IP appliances 
                   and Appliance Controllers.  A variety of networking 
                   technologies may be employed.  Examples are: 802.3, 
                   802.11, and Bluetooth [8]. 
    
   Figure 2 shows an example message flow for wide-area NA control.

   In this scenario, a user (SIP UA address user@example.com) remotely 
   turns on a lamp in the home with domain name example-home.net.  The 
   Appliance Controller has a SIP UA with SIP address lamp@ac.example-
   home.net. 
    
   The body of the DO message sent by the user contains XML describing 
   the action to be performed by the NA.  When the Appliance Controller 
   receives the DO message, it must interpret the action specified in 
   the DO body and send the appropriate command to the lamp (e.g., 
   ÙONˆ).  The Appliance Controller will then respond with 200 OK to the 
   user to indicate that the action has been performed. 
    
    
5. DO Method Definition 
    
   This specification defines a new SIP method, DO. The purpose of DO is 
   to enable messages or requests to be sent to NAs without setting up a 
   new session.  However, DO can be used within the context of an 
   existing session, and will share the same Call ID as the existing 
   session.  The message or request will be carried in the body of the 
   DO message.  The BNF for this method is: 
    
           Do  =  "DO" 
    
    
5.1. Header Field Support for DO Method 
    
   The following table is an extension of tables 4 and 5 in the SIP 
   specification.  Refer to the SIP Specification for a description of 
   the content of the table.

5.2. Responses to DO Requests 
    
   A 200 OK response is sent if the DO request was successful.  The 
   message body MAY include additional information to reflect the result 
   of the successful DO request, such as current device status. 
    
   Request Failure (4xx), Server Failure (5xx) and Global Failure (6xx)  
   responses can also be sent for the DO Request. 
    
    
5.3. Message Body Inclusion 
    
   DO requests SHOULD contain a message body, which contains information 
   on the action to be performed by the NA.  This document does not 
   specify the format for the DO message body, which may depend on the 
   application domain. For Networked Appliances, there is an

Internet Draft      SIP Extensions for NA Control       November 2000 
 
   investigation underway to define a Device Messaging Protocol (DMP) 
   MIME type that can be used as a DO message body. 
    
 
5.4. Behaviour of SIP User Agents 
    
   The protocol processing rules applied by the SIP User Agent (UA) are 
   similar to those for non-INVITE requests. DO requests do not set up 
   sessions and do not require session state to be maintained. Each DO 
   request MAY have a distinct Call-ID or several DO requests MAY share 
   the same Call-ID. In the latter case, the receiving UA MUST enforce 
   ordering. DO requests MAY be part of an INVITE-initiated session. 
   (For example, a video camera could use DO requests, using a suitable 
   message body, to control its pan, tilt and zoom operations.) 
    
    
5.5. Behaviour of SIP Proxy and Redirect Servers 
    
5.5.1  Proxy Server 
    
   The protocol rules applied by the SIP Proxy Server shall be similar 
   to those applied used for any other SIP request. 
      
   Forking Proxy Server 
    
   The protocol rules applied by the SIP Forking Proxy Server are the 
   same as for other non-INVITE requests. 
    
5.5.2  Redirect Server 
    
   The protocol rules applied by the SIP Redirect Server shall be 
   similar to those applied used for the INVITE request.  The key 
   difference is that the DO message shall not change the state of the 
   session. 
 
6. Security Considerations 
    
   Unauthorized use of networked appliances may cause injury or property 
   damage. Thus, implementations SHOULD use authentication to ensure 
   that only authorized entities control network appliances and that the 
   message body cannot be altered without detection, as described in 
   Section 13 of RFC 2543.
