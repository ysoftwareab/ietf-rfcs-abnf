Abstract

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework
   for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network.
   Currently options are limited to an information size of 256 bytes
   because of the one-octet size of the length field.  This document 
   defines a new option that permits the continuation of the previous 
   option information.


1. Introduction

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [1] provides a
   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP
   network.  Configuration parameters and other control information are
   carried in tagged data items that are stored in the 'options' field
   of the DHCP message.  The data items themselves are also called
   "options."

   Each option is assigned a one-octet option code and an one-octet size
   field.  The one-octet size field limits the information contained in
   an option to 256 bytes.  While there exist options that permit the use
   of the sname and file fields of the header, these options only add an
   additional 192 bytes when the fields are not in use.  This document
   describes a new DHCP option for continuing the information from the
   previous option.  This option MUST not appear as the first option in
   a message.  The option preceding this one MUST have a size of 256 
   bytes.


2. Definition of option [TBD]

   Option code [TBD] indicates that the data contained in the option is
   a continuation of the previous option.

                Continuation
    Code   Len  option code   Data...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--------------
   | TBD | XXX | Continuation of previous option data  
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---------------

   The example below shows how the option would work with a hypothetical
   authentication option that requires more than 255 bytes of information.

                Auth
    Code   Len  option Data...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--------------
   | 90  | 256 | 04  | d1    d2    d4     ... d255
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---------------
    Code   Len  Data...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--------------
   | TBD | 20  | d257 d258  d259  d260    ... d276
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---------------

4. Security Considerations

   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security mechanisms.
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
   protocol specification [1].  One of the reasons for this definition is
   to provide support for the exchange of public key certificates are
   which usually larger than 256 bytes.
