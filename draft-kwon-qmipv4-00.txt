   get the care-of address of a mobile node and to deliver the
   subsequent data packets over the optimized data path. The proposed
   QMIP scheme can be applied to MIPv4 and Proxy MIPv6 as well.

1. Introduction

   The Mobile IP (MIP) was designed to support IP mobility [2]. However,
   it suffers from the well-known 'triangular routing' problem, in which
   Correspondent Node (CN) should transmit data packets to Mobile Node
   (MN) via Home Agent (HA) over a non-optimized data path, until the
   route optimization is additionally performed between CN and MN.
   Another crucial concern of MIP is the excessive data traffic load at
   HA, since all the data packets from CNs toward MNs should be
   delivered by way of HA. Such overhead at HA will become much severe,
   as the number of MNs increases in the network.

   This paper proposes a simple extension of MIPv4, called Query-based
   MIPv4 (QMIPv4), in which the Access Router (AR) attached to CN will
   perform the binding query to HA, so as to get the Care-of Address
   (CoA) of MN and to deliver all the subsequent data packets over the
   optimized data path. For this purpose, we define the two new
   messages: Binding Query Request and Binding Query Reply.

   The proposed QMIP scheme can also be applied to the Proxy MIPv6
   (PMIPv6) [3], rather than MIPv6 [4], since PMIPv6 has the similar
   structure with MIPv4. We will first present QMIPv4, and then discuss
   Query-based PMIPv6.

3. Query-Based MIPv4

3.1. Data Transmission with Binding Query

   We consider a simple network model for QMIPv4, as depicted in Fig. 1.
   In the figure, MN performs the MIPv4 registration (or binding update),
   and then CN tries to communicate with MN. The AR attached to CN acts
   as a normal router with its own Query Cache (QC) table. This QC table
   will be referred to by AR to identify the CoA of MN. Note that this
   AR may also function as a Foreign Agent (FA) in the network.

   Now, CN transmits data packets to MN over Home Address (HoA) of MN.
   On reception of the first data packet destined to MN, the AR will
   first look for CoA of MN in its QC table. If the corresponding CoA is
   found in the table (we call it Cache Hit), AR will deliver the data
   packet directly to MN by using the IP-in-IP tunneling. Otherwise, if
   the CoA is not found (we call it Cache Miss), the AR will send a
   Binding Query Request message to HA so as to get the CoA. Then, HA
   responds with a Binding Query Reply message (containing CoA of MN) to
   AR. The resulting information of mapping between HoA and CoA of MN
   will be recorded into the QC table of AR, which will be referred to
   by AR in the subsequent data transmissions to MN.

   In MIPv4, MN will perform the registration with HA. All the data
   packets transmitted by CN will be forwarded to HA and delivered by HA
   to MN using the IP-in-IP tunneling, whereas MN will transmit its data
   packets directly to CN, and hence the triangular routing occurs. Just

Internet-Draft       QMIP: Query-based Mobile IP           August 2009


   after the route optimization, CN can use the optimized path for data
   delivery to MN.

   The QMIPv4 is the same with MIPv4, other than the binding query
   operation with HA. When the first data packet arrives from CN, AR
   will search for the corresponding CoA of MN in its QC table. In case
   of Cache Hit that the CoA is found in the table, AR can transmit the
   data packet directly to MN over the optimized path. However, in case
   of Cache Miss, AR should perform the binding query to HA. After this,
   all the subsequent data packets will be delivered to MN over the
   optimized route, without further binding query operations.

   Note that in MIPv4 the data transport between MN and CN will be done
   over the optimized route, just after the route optimization is
   completed, whereas the proposed QMIPv4 can intrinsically realize the
   route optimization with a single binding query operation. Moreover,
   in QMIPv4, Cache Hit may occur even for the first data packet of CN
   (i.e., the binding query operation can be omitted), if another CN in
   the same AR region is already communicating with the identical MN at
   that time.

   With the data transport over the optimized path, QMIPv4 can reduce
   the transmission delays of data packets, compared to MIPv4. In
   addition, QMIPv4 can avoid the problem of the excessive data traffic
   load at HA, since the data transmission to MN will be performed by
   the concerned AR, instead of HA, in the distributed manner.

3.3. New Message for QMIPv4

   To support the QMIPv4, the two messages need to be newly defined:
   Binding Query Request (from AR to HA) and Binding Query Reply (from
   HA to AR). These messages can be defined in the similar format with
   the MIP registration request/reply messages, as shown in Fig. 3.

   As shown in the figure, the Binding Query Request message contains

3.4. Consider of Query-Based Proxy MIPv6

   The Query-based MIP scheme can also be applied to the Proxy MIPv6. In
   this case, the PMIPv6 Mobile Access Gateway will function as the
   QMIPv4 AR and/or FA, and the PMIPv6 Localized Mobility Agent acts as
   the QMIPv4 HA. In addition, the PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Update messages

   may need to be extended to support the binding query operation.
   Details of the Query-based PMIPv6 are for further study.

4. Security Considerations

   To be continue.

5. IANA Considerations

   This specification has no actions for IANA.

6. Conclusions

   This paper presents the Query-based MIP scheme that uses the binding
   query to HA so as to get the optimized data path. The proposed QMIP
   scheme can be applied to both MIPv4 and PMIPv6. In QMIP, we can
   achieve much smaller transmission delay of data packets than MIP in
   the usual case. Moreover, the QMIP is helpful to avoid the excessive
   data traffic load at HA, since the data transmission to MN will be
   performed by AR in the network, instead of HA.
