Assertion Values for a Resource Priority Header Claim and a SIP Priority
         Header Claim in Support of Emergency Services Networks
               draft-ietf-stir-rph-emergency-services-07

Abstract

   This document adds new assertion values for a Resource Priority
   Header ("rph") claim and a new SIP Priority Header claim ("sph") for
   protection of the "psap-callback" value as part of the "rph" PASSporT
   extension, in support of the security of Emergency Services Networks
   for emergency call origination and callback.

1.  Introduction

   Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) Extension for Resource Priority
   Authorization [RFC8443] extended the Personal Assertion Token
   (PASSporT) specification defined in [RFC8225] to allow the inclusion
   of cryptographically signed assertions of authorization for the
   values populated in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Resource-
   Priority" header field [RFC4412].  [I-D.rosen-stir-emergency-calls]
   introduces the need and justification for the protection of both the
   SIP "Resource-Priority" and "Priority" header fields, used for
   categorizing the priority use of the call in the telephone network,
   specifically for emergency calls.

   Compromise of the SIP "Resource-Priority" or "Priority" header fields
   could lead to misuse of network resources (i.e., during congestion
   scenarios), impacting the application services supported using the
   SIP "Resource-Priority" header field and the handling of Public
   Saftey Answering Point (PSAP) callbacks.

   [RFC8225] allows extensions by which an authority on the originating
   side verifying the authorization of a particular communication for
   the SIP "Resource-Priority" header field or the SIP "Priority" header
   field can use PASSPorT claims to cryptographically sign the
   information associated with either the SIP "Resource-Priority" or
   "Priority" header field and convey assertion of those values by the
   signing party authorization.  A signed SIP "Resource-Priority" or
   "Priority" header field will allow a receiving entity (including
   entities located in different network domains/boundaries) to verify

Internet-Draft      RPH Values for Emergency Services         March 2021


   the validity of assertions to act on the information with confidence
   that the information has not been spoofed or compromised.

   This document adds new "auth" array key values for a Resource
   Priority Header ("rph") claim defined in [RFC8443], in support of
   Emergency Services Networks for emergency call origination and
   callback.  This document additionally defines a new PASSporT claim,
   "sph", including protection of the SIP Priority header field for the
   indication of an emergency service call-back assigned the value
   "psap-callback" as defined in [RFC7090].  The use of the newly
   defined claim and key values corresponding to the SIP 'Resource-
   Priority' and 'Priority' header fields for emergency services is
   introduced in [I-D.rosen-stir-emergency-calls] but otherwise out-of-
   scope of this document.  In addition, the PASSPorT claims and values
   defined in this document are intended for use in environments where
   there are means to verify that the signer of the SIP 'Resource-
   Priority' and 'Priority' header fields is authoritative.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  New Assertion Values for "rph" claim

   This specification defines the ability to sign the SIP Resource-
   Priority Header field namespace for local emergency communications
   defined in [RFC7135] and represented by the string "esnet.x" where x
   is the priority-level allowed in the esnet namespace.  As of the
   writing of this specification the priority-level is between 0 and 4,
   inclusive, but may be extended by future specifications.

   Similar to the values defined by [RFC8443] for the "auth" JSON object
   key inside the "rph" claim, the string "esnet.x" with the appropriate
   value should be used when resource priority is required for local
   emergency communications corresponding and exactly matching the SIP
   Resource-Priority header field representing the namespace invoked in
   the call.

   When using "esnet.x" as the "auth" assertion value in emergency
   service destined calls, the "orig" claim of the PASSporT MUST
   represent the calling party number that initiates the call to
   emergency services.  The "dest" claim MUST either be a country or
   region specific dial string (e.g., "911" for North America or "112"
   GSM defined string used in Europe and other countries) or

Internet-Draft      RPH Values for Emergency Services         March 2021


   "urn:service:sos" as defined in [RFC5031], representing the emergency
   services destination of the call.

   The following is an example of an "rph" claim for SIP 'Resource-
   Priority' header field with an "esnet.1" assertion:

     {
       "dest":{"uri":["urn:service:sos"]},
       "iat":1615471428,
       "orig":{"tn":"12155551212"},
       "rph":{"auth":["esnet.1"]}
     }

   For emergency services callbacks, the "orig" claim of the "rph"
   PASSporT MUST represent the Public Saftey Answering Point (PSAP)
   telephone number.  The "dest" claim MUST be the telephone number
   representing the original calling party of the emergency service call
   that is being called back.

   The following is an example of an "rph" claim for SIP 'Resource-
   Priority' header field with a "esnet.0" assertion:

     {
       "dest":{"tn":["12155551212"]},
       "iat":1615471428,
       "orig":{"tn":"12155551213"},
       "rph":{"auth":["esnet.0"]}
     }

   After the header and claims PASSporT objects have been constructed,
   their signature is generated normally per the guidance in [RFC8225]
   using the full form of PASSPorT.  The credentials (i.e., Certificate)
   used to create the signature must have authority over the namespace
   of the "rph" claim, and there is only one authority per claim.  The
   authority MUST use its credentials associated with the specific
   service supported by the resource priority namespace in the claim.
   If r-values are added or dropped by the intermediaries along the
   path, the intermediaries must generate a new "rph" identity header
   and sign the claim with their own authority.

4.  The SIP Priority header "sph" claim

   As defined in [RFC7090] the SIP Priority header field may be set to
   the value "psap-callback" for emergency services callback calls.
   Because some SIP networks may act on this value and provide priority
   or other special routing based on this value, it is important to
   protect and validate the authoritative use associated with it.

Internet-Draft      RPH Values for Emergency Services         March 2021


   Therefore, we define a new claim key as part of the "rph" PASSporT,
   "sph".  This is an optional claim that MUST only be used only with an
   "auth" claim with an "esnet.x" value indicating an authorized
   emergency callback call and corresponding to a SIP Priority header
   field with the value "psap-callback".

   The value of the "sph" claim key should only be "psap-callback" which
   MUST match the SIP Priority header field value for authorized
   emergency services callbacks.  If the value is anything other than
   "psap-callback", the PASSporT validation MUST be considered a failure
   case.

   Note: Because the intended use of this specification is only for
   emergency services, there is also an explicit assumption that the
   signer of the "rph" PASSporT can authoritatively represent both the
   content of the Resource Priority Header field and Priority Header
   field information associated specifically with a emergency services
   callback case where both could exist.  This document is not intended
   to be a general mechanism for protecting SIP Priority Header fields,
   this could be accomplished as part of future work with a new PASSporT
   extension or new claim added to either an existing PASSporT or
   PASSporT extension usage.

   The following is an example of an "sph" claim for SIP 'Priority'
   header field with the value "psap-callback":

     {
       "dest":{"tn":["12155551212"]},
       "iat":1615471428,
       "orig":{"tn":"12155551213"},
       "rph":{"auth":["esnet.0"]},
       "sph":"psap-callback"
     }

5.  Order of Claim Keys

   The order of the claim keys MUST follow the rules of [RFC8225]
   Section 9 which defines the deterministic JSON serialization used for
   signature generation (and validation); the claim keys MUST appear in
   lexicographic order.  Therefore, the claim keys discussed in this
   document appear in the PASSporT Payload in the following order,

   o  dest

   o  iat

   o  orig

   o  rph

   o  sph

6.  Compact Form of PASSporT

   The use of the compact form of PASSporT is not specified in this
   document or recommended for 'rph' PASSporTs.
