2.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC3761 [2]) is a system that transforms
   E.164 numbers [3] into domain names and then uses DNS (Domain Name
   Service, RFC1034 [4]) services like delegation through NS records and
   NAPTR records to look up what services are available for a specific
   domain name.

   This document registers Enumservices according to the guidelines
   given in RFC3761 to be used for provisioning in the services field of
   a NAPTR [7] resource record to indicate what class of functionality a
   given end point offers.  The registration is defined within the DDDS
   (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System [5][6][7][8][9]) hierarchy, for
   use with the "E2U" DDDS Application defined in RFC3761.

   The following Enumservices are registered with this document:
   "email", "fax", "sms", "ems" and "mms".  These share a common feature
   in that they each indicate that the functionality of the given end
   points and the associated resources are capable of receiving discrete
   messages, albeit of different types.

   According to RFC3761, the Enumservice registered must be able to
   function as a selection mechanism when choosing one NAPTR resource
   record from another.  That means that the registration MUST specify
   what is expected when using that very NAPTR record, and the URI
   scheme which is the outcome of the use of it.

   Therefore an Enumservice acts as a hint, indicating the kind of
   service with which the URI constructed using the regexp field is
   associated.  There can be more than one Enumservice included within a
   single NAPTR; this indicates that there is more than one service that
   can be achieved using the associated URI scheme.

   The common thread with this set of definitions is that they reflect
   the kind of service that the end user will hope to achieve with the
   communication using the associated URI.

   The services specified here are intended not to specify the protocol
   or even method of connection that must be used to achieve each
   service.  Instead they define the kind of interactive behaviour that
   an end user will expect, leaving the end system to decide (based on
   policies outside the remit of this specification) how to execute the
   service.

   Since the same URI scheme may be used for different services (e.g.
   'tel:'), and the same kind of service may use different URI schemes
   (e.g.  for VoIP 'h323:' and 'tel:' may be used), it is necessary in
   some cases to specify the service and the URI scheme used.

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration for Message Enumservices  February 2005

   The service parameters defined in RFC3761 allow therefore a "type"
   and a "subtype" to be specified.  Within this set of specifications
   the convention is assumed that the "type" (being the more generic
   term) defines the service and the "subtype" defines the URI scheme.

   Even where currently only one URI scheme is associated with a given
   service, it should be considered that an additional URI scheme to be
   used with this service may be added later.  Thus the subtype is
   needed to identify the specific Enumservice intended.

   In this document, there are two URI schemes that are used within the
   various services.  These are 'tel:', as specified in RFC3966 [10] and
   'mailto:', as specified in RFC2368 [11].

4.  Fax Service Registration

   Enumservice Name: "fax"

   Enumservice Type: "fax"

   Enumservice Subtype: "tel"

   URI Scheme: 'tel:'

   Functional Specification:

   This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
   associated URI scheme is capable of being contacted to provide a
   communication session during which facsimile documents can be sent.

   A client selecting this NAPTR will have support for generating and
   sending facsimile documents to the recipient using the PSTN session
   and transfer protocols specified in [12] and [13] - in short, they
   will have a fax program with a local or shared PSTN access over which
   they can send faxes.

5.  MMS, EMS, SMS Service

5.1  Introduction

   An ENUM NAPTR indicates ability on the part of the Subscriber to
   receive specified communication service (or services) provided via
   the contact address (shown in the generated URI).

   In the case of MMS, EMS, and SMS services, the capability of these
   services is a nested superset; thus a service supporting MMS can
   support also delivery of EMS or SMS messages to a recipient that is
   capable of receiving an MM, whilst a service supporting EMS can also
   deliver SMS messages to a recipient that can accept receipt of EM.

   Thus, if a client is capable only of generating and sending an SMS
   message, they MAY choose to consider also NAPTRs indicating contacts
   that indicate EMS and/or MMS, as these indicate that the destination
   can accept EM and/or MM; these services will be able to deliver an
   SMS message to the recipient address.

   Conversely, a client capable of sending MMS messages may choose to
   consider also NAPTRs indicating support for EMS or SMS messages,
   "downgrading" their User Interface to allow only generation of
   messages that conform to SMS or EMS standards.

   These behaviours on the part of the client are purely optional, and
   are NOT the subject of any protocol standardisation.

5.2  SMS Service Registrations

5.2.1  SMS Service Registration with tel: URI

   Enumservice Name: "sms"

   Enumservice Type: "sms"

   Enumservice Subtypes: "tel"

   URI Scheme: 'tel:'

   Any other information the author deems interesting:

   Note that MMS can be used as an alternative to deliver an SMS RP-DATA
   RPDU if, for example, the SMS bearer is not supported.  If an entry
   includes this Enumservice, then in effect this can be taken as
   implying that the recipient is capable of receiving EMS or SMS
   messages at this address.  Such choices on the end system design do
   have a small caveat; whilst in practice all terminals supporting MMS
   today support SMS as well, it might not necessarily be the case in
   the future.

6.  Security Considerations

   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database.  Thus any
   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously.  Whilst
   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a Telephone
   Directory, it does open the data subject to having "their"
   information collected automatically without any indication that this
   has been done or by whom.

   Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists
   of targets for unrequested information; in short, they are used to
   address "spam".  Anyone who uses a Web-archived mailing list is aware
   that the volume of "spam" email they are sent increases when they
   post to the mailing list; publication of a telephone number in ENUM
   is no different, and may be used to send "junk faxes" or "junk SMS"
   for example.

   Many mailing list users have more than one email address and use
   "sacrificial" email accounts when posting to such lists to help
   filter out unrequested emails sent to them.  This is not so easy with
   published telephone numbers; the PSTN E.164 number assignment process
   is much more involved and usually a single E.164 number (or a fixed
   range of numbers) is associated with each PSTN access.  Thus
   providing a "sacrificial" phone number in any publication is not
   possible.

   Due to the implications of publishing data on a globally accessible
   database, as a principle the data subject MUST give their explicit
   informed consent to data being published in ENUM.

   In addition, they should be made aware that, due to storage of such
   data during harvesting by third parties, removal of the data from
   publication will not remove any copies that have been taken; in
   effect, any publication may be permanent.

   However, regulations in many regions will require that the data
   subject can at any time request that the data is removed from
   publication, and that their consent for its publication is explicitly
   confirmed at regular intervals.

   When placing a fax call via the PSTN or a sending a message via the
   Public Land Mobile Network, the sender may be charged for this
   action.  In both kinds of network, calling or messaging to some
   numbers is more expensive than sending to others; both networks have
   "premium rate" services that can charge considerably more than a
   "normal" call or message destination.  As such, it is important that
   the end user be asked to confirm sending the message, and that the
   destination number be presented to them.  It is the originating


Brandner, et al.         Expires August 17, 2005               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration for Message Enumservices  February 2005

   user's choice on whether or not to send a message to this destination
   number, but they SHOULD be shown the destination number so that they
   can make this decision.

   Although a fax number, like other E.164 numbers, doesn't appear to
   reveal as much identity information about a user as a name in the
   format user@host (e.g.  an email or sip address), the information is
   still publicly available, thus there is still the risk of unwanted
   communication.

   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS,
   and the applicability of DNSSEC [17] to these, is provided in RFC3761
   [2].  A thorough analysis of threats to the DNS itself is covered in
   RFC3833 [18].

   An email address is a canonical address by which a user is known.
   Placing this address in ENUM is comparable to placing a SIP or H.323
   address in the DNS.

   DNS does not make any policy decisions about the records that it
   shares with an inquirer.  All DNS records must be assumed to be
   available to all inquirers at all times.  The information provided
   within an ENUM NAPTR resource record must therefore be considered to
   be open to the public, which is a cause for some privacy
   considerations.

   Therefore ENUM Subscribers should be made aware of this risk.  Since
   it is within the responsibility of the ENUM Subscriber which data is
   entered in ENUM, it is within the ENUM Subscribers control if he
   enters email addresses:
   1.  allowing inference of private data e.g.  his first and last name
   2.  at all

   It should also be considered that it is the purpose of public
   communication identifiers to be publicly known.  To reduce spam and
   other unwanted communication other means should be made available,
   such as incoming message filtering.

   Some Value Added Service Providers use receipt of a short message to
   a given special service telephone number as a trigger to start
   delivery of data messages to the calling number.  By sending an SMS
   (or, in principle, an EMS or MMS) to one of these special service
   numbers, one is entering into a contract to pay for receipt of a set
   of messages containing information (e.g.  news, sports results, "Ring
   Tones").

   Thus it is very important that the end terminal presents the
   destination number to which any message is to be sent using the

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration for Message Enumservices  February 2005

   "sms:tel", "ems:tel" or "mms:tel" Enumservices, to allow the end user
   to cancel any message before it is sent to one of these numbers.

   At present these systems use the circuit switched network trusted
   calling line identifier to identify the destination for the
   subsequent charged information messages, and so it is believed that
   sending using the "sms:mailto", "ems:mailto" or "mms:mailto"
   Enumservices does not have this risk currently.
