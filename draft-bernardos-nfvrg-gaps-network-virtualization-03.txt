           Gap Analysis on Network Virtualization Activities
          draft-bernardos-nfvrg-gaps-network-virtualization-03

Abstract

   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking
   (SDN) are changing the way the telecommunications sector will deploy,
   extend and operate their networks.  These new technologies aim at
   reducing the overall costs by outsourcing communication services from
   specific hardware in the operators' core to server farms scattered in
   datacenters (i.e. compute and storage virtualization).  In addition,
   the connecting networks are fundamentally affected in they way they
   route, process and control traffic(i.e. network virtualization).

   Virtualization is becoming a trend which is being adopted in many
   scenarios for different purposes.  This document overviews existing
   efforts around virtualization at the IETF/IRTF, focusing on those
   related to NFV and SDN.  These efforts are mapped to the most
   relevant architectures being defined outside IETF, namely at the ETSI
   NFV ISG, the ETSI MEC ISG and the ONF.

   The main goal of this document is to serve as a survey of the
   different efforts that have been taken and are currently taking place
   at IETF and IRTF in regards to network virtualization, putting them
   into context considering efforts by other SDOs, and identifying
   current gaps that can be tackled at IETF or researched at the IRTF.

1.  Introduction

   The telecommunications sector is experiencing a major revolution that
   will shape the way networks and services are designed and deployed
   for the next decade.  We are witnessing an explosion in the number of
   applications and services demanded by users, which are now really
   capable of accessing them on the move.  In order to cope with such a
   demand, some network operators are looking at the cloud computing
   paradigm, which enables a potential reduction of the overall costs by
   outsourcing communication services from specific hardware in the
   operator's core to server farms scattered in datacenters.  These
   services have different characteristics if compared with conventional
   IT services that have to be taken into account in this cloudification
   process.  Also the transport network is affected in that it is
   evolving to a more sophisticated form of IP architecture with trends
   like separation of control and data plane traffic, and more fine-
   grained forwarding of packets (beyond looking at the destination IP
   address) in the network to fulfill new business and service goals.

   Virtualization of functions also provides operators with tools to
   deploy new services much faster, as compared to the traditional use
   of monolithic and tightly integrated dedicated machinery.  As a
   natural next step, mobile network operators need to re-think how to
   evolve their existing network infrastructures and how to deploy new
   ones to address the challenges posed by the increasing customers'
   demands, as well as by the huge competition among operators.  All
   these changes are triggering the need for a modification in the way
   operators and infrastructure providers operate their networks, as
   they need to significantly reduce the costs incurred in deploying a

   new service and operating it.  Some of the mechanisms that are being
   considered and already adopted by operators include: sharing of
   network infrastructure to reduce costs, virtualization of core
   servers running in data centers as a way of supporting their load-
   aware elastic dimensioning, and dynamic energy policies to reduce the
   monthly electricity bill.  However, this has proved to be tough to
   put in practice, and not enough.  Indeed, it is not easy to deploy
   new mechanisms in a running operational network due to the high
   dependency on proprietary (and sometime obscure) protocols and
   interfaces, which are complex to manage and often require configuring
   multiple devices in a decentralized way.

   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking
   (SDN) are changing the way the telecommunications sector will deploy,
   extend and operate their networks.  This document provides a survey
   of the different efforts that have taken and are currently taking
   place at IETF and IRTF in regards of network virtualization, looking
   at how they relate to the ETSI NFV ISG, ETSI MEC ISG and ONF
   architectural frameworks.  Based on this analysis, we also go a step
   farther, identifying which are the potential work areas where IETF/
   IRTF can work on to complement the complex network virtualization map
   of technologies being standardized today.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms used in this document are defined by the ETSI NVF
   ISG, and the ONF and the IETF:

      NFV Infrastructure (NFVI): totality of all hardware and software
      components which build up the environment in which VNFs are
      deployed

      NFV Management and Orchestration (NFV-MANO): functions
      collectively provided by NFVO, VNFM, and VIM.

      NFV Orchestrator (NFVO): functional block that manages the Network
      Service (NS) lifecycle and coordinates the management of NS
      lifecycle, VNF lifecycle (supported by the VNFM) and NFVI
      resources (supported by the VIM) to ensure an optimized allocation
      of the necessary resources and connectivity.

      OpenFlow protocol (OFP): allowing vendor independent programming
      of control functions in network nodes.

      Service Function Chain (SFC): for a given service, the abstracted
      view of the required service functions and the order in which they
      are to be applied.  This is somehow equivalent to the Network
      Function Forwarding Graph (NF-FG) at ETSI.

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis Network Virtualization    September 2015


      Service Function Path (SFP): the selection of specific service
      function instances on specific network nodes to form a service
      graph through which an SFC is instantiated.

      virtual EPC (vEPC): control plane of 3GPPs EPC operated on NFV
      framework (as defined by [I-D.matsushima-stateless-uplane-vepc]).

      Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM): functional block that is
      responsible for controlling and managing the NFVI compute, storage
      and network resources, usually within one operator's
      Infrastructure Domain.

      Virtualized Network Function (VNF): implementation of a Network
      Function that can be deployed on a Network Function Virtualisation
      Infrastructure (NFVI).

      Virtualized Network Function Manager (VNFM): functional block that
      is responsible for the lifecycle management of VNF.

3.  Background

3.1.  Network Function Virtualization

   The ETSI ISG NFV is a working group which, since 2012, aims to evolve
   quasi-standard IT virtualization technology to consolidate many
   network equipment types into industry standard high volume servers,
   switches, and storage.  It enables implementing network functions in
   software that can run on a range of industry standard server hardware
   and can be moved to, or loaded in, various locations in the network
   as required, without the need to install new equipment.  To date,
   ETSI NFV is by far the most accepted NFV reference framework and
   architectural footprint [etsi_nvf_whitepaper].  The ETSI NFV
   framework architecture framework is composed of three domains
   (Figure 1):

   o  Virtualized Network Function, running over the NFVI.

   o  NFV Infrastructure (NFVI), including the diversity of physical
      resources and how these can be virtualized.  NFVI supports the
      execution of the VNFs.

   o  NFV Management and Orchestration, which covers the orchestration
      and life-cycle management of physical and/or software resources
      that support the infrastructure virtualization, and the life-cycle
      management of VNFs.  NFV Management and Orchestration focuses on
      all virtualization specific management tasks necessary in the NFV
      framework.

   The NFV architectural framework identifies functional blocks and the
   main reference points between such blocks.  Some of these are already
   present in current deployments, whilst others might be necessary
   additions in order to support the virtualization process and
   consequent operation.  The functional blocks are (Figure 2):

   o  Virtualized Network Function (VNF).

   o  Element Management (EM).

   o  NFV Infrastructure, including: Hardware and virtualized resources,
      and Virtualization Layer.

   o  Virtualized Infrastructure Manager(s) (VIM).

   o  NFV Orchestrator.

   o  VNF Manager(s).

   o  Service, VNF and Infrastructure Description.

3.2.  Software Defined Networking

   The Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm pushes the
   intelligence currently residing in the network elements to a central
   controller implementing the network functionality through software.
   In contrast to traditional approaches, in which the network's control
   plane is distributed throughout all network devices, with SDN the
   control plane is logically centralized.  In this way, the deployment
   of new characteristics in the network no longer requires of complex
   and costly changes in equipment or firmware updates, but only a
   change in the software running in the controller.  The main advantage

   of this approach is the flexibility it provides operators with to
   manage their network, i.e., an operator can easily change its
   policies on how traffic is distributed throughout the network.

   The most visible of the SDN protocol stacks is the OpenFlow protocol
   (OFP), which is maintained and extended by the Open Network
   Foundation (ONF: https://www.opennetworking.org/).  Originally this
   protocol was developed specifically for IEEE 802.1 switches
   conforming to the ONF OpenFlow Switch specification.  As the benefits
   of the SDN paradigm have reached a wider audience, its application
   has been extended to more complex scenarios such as Wireless and
   Mobile networks.  Within this area of work, the ONF is actively
   developing new OFP extensions addressing three key scenarios: (i)
   Wireless backhaul, (ii) Cellular Evolved Packet Core (EPC), and (iii)
   Unified access and management across enterprise wireless and fixed
   networks.

                 Figure 3: High level SDN ONF architecture

   Figure 3 shows the blocks and the functional interfaces of the ONF
   architecture, which comprises three planes: Data, Controller, and
   Application.  The Data plane comprehends several Network Entities
   (NE), which expose their capabilities toward the Controller plane via
   a Southbound API.  The Controller plane includes several cooperating
   modules devoted to the creation and maintenance of an abstracted

   resource model of the underneath network.  Such model is exposed to
   the applications via a Northbound API where the Application plane
   comprises several applications/services, each of which has exclusive
   control of a set of exposed resources.

   The Management plane spans its functionality across all planes
   performing the initial configuration of the network elements in the
   Data plane, the assignment of the SDN controller and the resources
   under its responsibility.  In the Controller plane, the Management
   needs to configure the policies defining the scope of the control
   given to the SDN applications, to monitor the performance of the
   system, and to configure the parameters required by the SDN
   controller modules.  In the Application plane, Management configures
   the parameters of the applications and the service level agreements.
   In addition to the these interactions, the Management plane exposes
   several functions to network operators which can easily and quickly
   configure and tune the network at each layer.

3.3.  Mobile Edge Computing

   Mobile Edge Computing capabilities deployed in the edge of the mobile
   network can facilitate the efficient and dynamic provision of
   services to mobile users.  The ETSI ISG MEC working group, operative
   from end of 2014, intends to specify an open environment for
   integrating MEC capabilities with service providers networks,
   including also applications from 3rd parties.  These distributed
   computing capabilities will make available IT infrastructure as in a
   cloud environment for the deployment of functions in mobile access
   networks.  It can be seen then as a complement to both NFV and SDN.

3.4.  IEEE 802.1CF (OmniRAN)

   The IEEE 802.1CF Recommended Practice specifies an access network,
   which connects terminals to their access routers, utilizing
   technologies based on the family of IEEE 802 Standards (e.g., 802.3
   Ethernet, 802.11 Wi-Fi, etc.).  The specification defines an access
   network reference model, including entities and reference points
   along with behavioral and functional descriptions of communications
   among those entities.

   The goal of this project is to help unifying the support of different
   interfaces, enabling shared network control and use of software
   defined network (SDN) principles, thereby lowering the barriers to
   new network technologies, to new network operators, and to new
   service providers.

3.5.  Distributed Management Task Force

   The DMTF is an industry standards organization working to simplify
   the manageability of network-accessible technologies through open and
   collaborative efforts by some technology companies.  The DMTF is
   involved in the creation and adoption of interoperable management
   standards, supporting implementations that enable the management of
   diverse traditional and emerging technologies including cloud,
   virtualization, network and infrastructure.

   There are several DMTF initiatives that are relevant to the network
   virtualization area, such as the Open Virtualization Format (OVF),
   for VNF packaging; the Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface
   (CIM), for cloud infrastructure management; the Network Management
   (NETMAN), for VNF management; and, the Virtualization Management
   (VMAN), for virtualization infrastructure management.

3.6.  Open Source initiatives

   The Open Source community is especially active in the area of network
   virtualization.  We next summarize some of the active efforts:

   o  OpenStack.  OpenStack is a free and open-source cloud-computing
      software platform.

   o  OpenDayLight.  OpenDaylight (ODL) is a highly available, modular,
      extensible, scalable and multi-protocol controller infrastructure
      built for SDN deployments on modern heterogeneous multi-vendor
      networks.  It provides a model-driven service abstraction platform
      that allows users to write apps that easily work across a wide
      variety of hardware and southbound protocols.

   o  OPNFV.  OPNFV is a carrier-grade, integrated, open source platform
      to accelerate the introduction of new NFV products and services.
      By integrating components from upstream projects, the OPNFV
      community aims at conducting performance and use case-based
      testing to ensure the platform's suitability for NFV use cases.
      The scope of OPNFV's initial release is focused on building NFV
      Infrastructure (NFVI) and Virtualized Infrastructure Management
      (VIM) by integrating components from upstream projects such as
      OpenDaylight, OpenStack, Ceph Storage, KVM, Open vSwitch, and
      Linux.  These components, along with application programmable
      interfaces (APIs) to other NFV elements form the basic
      infrastructure required for Virtualized Network Functions (VNF)
      and Management and Network Orchestration (MANO) components.
      OPNFV's goal is to increase performance and power efficiency;
      improve reliability, availability, and serviceability; and deliver
      comprehensive platform instrumentation.

   Among the main areas that are being developed by the former open
   source activities that related to network virtualization research, we
   can highlight: policy-based resource management, analytics for
   visibility and orchestration, service verification with regards to
   security and resiliency.

4.  Network Virtualization at IETF/IRTF

4.1.  SFC WG

   Current network services deployed by operators often involve the
   composition of several individual functions (such as packet
   filtering, deep packet inspection, load balancing).  These services
   are typically implemented by the ordered combination of a number of
   service functions that are deployed at different points within a
   network, not necessary on the direct data path.  This requires
   traffic to be steered through the required service functions,
   wherever they are deployed.

   For a given service, the abstracted view of the required service
   functions and the order in which they are to be applied is called a
   Service Function Chain (SFC), which is called Network Function
   Forwarding Graph (NF-FG) in ETSI.  An SFC is instantiated through
   selection of specific service function instances on specific network
   nodes to form a service graph: this is called a Service Function Path
   (SFP).  The service functions may be applied at any layer within the
   network protocol stack (network layer, transport layer, application
   layer, etc.).

   The SFC working group is working on an architecture for service
   function chaining that includes the necessary protocols or protocol
   extensions to convey the Service Function Chain and Service Function
   Path information to nodes that are involved in the implementation of
   service functions and Service Function Chains, as well as mechanisms
   for steering traffic through service functions.

   In terms of actual work items, the SFC WG is chartered to deliver:
   (i) a problem statement document [RFC7498], (ii) an architecture
   document [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture], (iii) a service-level data
   plane encapsulation format (the encapsulation should indicate the
   sequence of service functions that make up the Service Function
   Chain, specify the Service Function Path, and communicate context
   information between nodes that implement service functions and
   Service Function Chains), and (iv) a document describing requirements
   for conveying information between control or management elements and
   SFC implementation points.

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis Network Virtualization    September 2015


   Potential gap: as stated in the SFC charter, any work on the
   management and configuration of SFC components related to the support
   of Service Function Chaining will not be done yet, until better
   understood and scoped.  This part is of special interest for
   operators and would be required in order to actually put SFC
   mechanisms into operation.

   Potential gap: redundancy and reliability mechanisms are currently
   not dealt with by any WG in the IETF.  While this has been the main
   goal of the VNFpool BoF efforts, it still remains un-addressed.

4.2.  NVO3 WG

   The Network Virtualization Overlays (NVO3) WG is developing protocols
   that enable network virtualization overlays within large Data Center
   (DC) environments.  Specifically NVO3 assumes an underlying physical
   Layer 3 (IP) fabric on which multiple tenant networks are virtualized
   on top (i.e. overlays).  With overlays, data traffic between tenants
   is tunneled across the underlying DC's IP network.  The use of
   tunnels provides a number of benefits by decoupling the network as
   viewed by tenants from the underlying physical network across which
   they communicate [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch].

   Potential gap: It would be worthwhile to see if some of the specific
   approaches developed in this WG (e.g. overlays, traffic isolation, VM
   migration) can be applied outside the DC, and specifically if they
   can be applicable to network virtualization (NFV).  These approaches
   would be most relevant to the ETSI Network Function Virtualization
   Infrastructure (NFVI), and the Virtualized Infrastructure Manager
   part of the MANO.

4.3.  DMM WG

   The Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) WG is looking at solutions
   for IP networks that enable traffic between mobile and correspondent
   nodes taking an optimal route, preventing some of the issues caused
   by the use of centralized mobility solutions, which anchor all the
   traffic at a given node (or a very limited set of nodes).  The DMM WG
   is considering the latest developments in mobile networking research
   and operational practices (i.e., flattening network architectures,
   the impact of virtualization, new deployment needs as wireless access
   technologies evolve in the coming years) and aims at describing how
   distributed mobility management addresses the new needs in this area
   better than previously standardized solutions.

   Although network virtualization is not the main area of the DMM work,
   the impact of SDN and NFV mechanisms is clear on the work that is
   currently being done in the WG.  One example is architecture defined



Bernardos, et al.        Expires March 31, 2016                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis Network Virtualization    September 2015


   for the virtual Evolved Packet Core (vEPC) in
   [I-D.matsushima-stateless-uplane-vepc].  Here, the authors describe a
   particular realization of the vEPC concept, which is designed to
   support NFV.  In the defined architecture, the user plane of EPC is
   decoupled from the control-plane and uses routing information to
   forward packets of mobile nodes.  This proposal does not modify the
   signaling of the EPC control plane, although the EPC control plane
   runs on an hypervisor.

   Potential gap: in a vEPC/DMM context, how to run the EPC control
   plane on NFV.

   The DMM WG is also looking at ways to supporting the separation of
   the Control-Plane for mobility- and session management from the
   actual Data-Plane [I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp].  The protocol semantics
   being defined abstract from the actual details for the configuration
   of Data-Plane nodes and apply between a Client function, which is
   used by an application of the mobility Control-Plane, and an Agent
   function, which is associated with the configuration of Data-Plane
   nodes according to the policies issued by the mobility Control-Plane.

   Potential gap: the actual mappings between these generic protocol
   semantics and the configuration commands required on the data plane
   network elements are not in the scope of this document, and are
   therefore a potential gap that will need to be addressed (e.g., for
   OpenFlow switches).

4.4.  I2RS WG

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) WG is developing a high-
   level architecture that describes the basic building-blocks to access
   the routing system through a set of protocol-based control or
   management interfaces.  This architecture, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture], comprises an I2RS Agent as a unified
   interface that is accessed by I2RS clients using the I2RS protocol.
   The client is controlled by one or more network applications and
   accesses one or more agents, as shown in the following figure:

   The I2RS architecture proposes to use model-driven APIs.  Services
   can correspond to different data-models and agents can indicate which
   model they support.

   Potential gap: network virtualization is not the main aim of the I2RS
   WG.  However, they provide an infrastructure that can be part of an
   SDN deployment.

4.5.  BESS WG

   BGP is already used as a protocol for provisioning and operating
   Layer-3 (routed) Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs).  The BGP Enabled
   Services (BESS) working group is responsible for defining,
   specifying, and extending network services based on BGP.  In
   particular, the working group will work on the following services:

   o  BGP-enabled VPN solutions for use in the data center networking.
      This work includes consideration of VPN scaling issues and
      mechanisms applicable to such environments.



Bernardos, et al.        Expires March 31, 2016                [Page 16]

   o  Extensions to BGP-enabled VPN solutions for the construction of
      virtual topologies in support of services such as Service Function
      Chaining.

   Potential gap: The most relevant activity in BESS that would be
   worthwhile to investigate for relevance to network virtualization
   (NFV) is the extensions to BGP-enabled VPN solutions to support of
   Service Function Chaining [I-D.rfernando-bess-service-chaining].

4.6.  VNFpool BoF

   The VNFPOOL BoF is working on the way to group Virtual Network
   Function (VNF) into pools to improve resilience, provide better
   scale-out and scale-in characteristics, implement stateful failover
   among VNF members of a pool, etc.  Additionally, they propose to
   create VNF sets from VNF pools.  For this, the BoF proposes to study
   signaling (both between members of a pool and across pools), state
   sharing mechanisms between members of a VNFPOOL, the exchange of
   reliability information between VNF sets, their users and the
   underlying network, and the reliability and security of the control
   plane needed to transport the exchanged information.

   The VNFPOOL BoF started work on the charter, use case study, and
   requirements and initial architecture.  The use cases include Content
   Deliver Networks (CDNs), the LTE mobile core network and reliable
   server pooling.  Currently, there is no activity on the mailing list
   setup for this activity.

   Potential gap: VNFPOOL tries to introduce and manage resilience in
   virtualized networking environments and therefore addresses a
   desirable feature for any software defined network.  VNFPOOL has also
   been integrated into the NFV architecture
   [I-D.bernini-nfvrg-vnf-orchestration].

4.7.  TEAS WG

   Transport network infrastructure provides end-to-end connectivity for
   networked applications and services.  Network virtualization
   facilitates effective sharing (or 'slicing') of physical
   infrastructure by representing resources and topologies via
   abstractions, even in a multi-administration, multi-vendor, multi-
   technology environment.  In this way, it becomes possible to operate,
   control and manage multiple physical networks elements as single
   virtualized network.  The users of such virtualized network can
   control the allocated resources in an optimal and flexible way,
   better adapting to the specific circumstances of higher layer
   applications.

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis Network Virtualization    September 2015


   Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN) intends to
   define methods and capabilities for the deployment and operation of
   transport network resources [I-D.ceccarelli-teas-actn-framework].
   This activity is currently being carried out within the Traffic
   Engineering Architecture and Signaling (TEAS) WG.

   Several use cases are being proposed for both fixed and mobile
   scenarios [I-D.leeking-teas-actn-problem-statement].

   Potential gap: Several use cases in ACTN are relevant to network
   virtualization (NFV) in mobile environments.  Control of multi-tenant
   mobile backhaul transport networks, mobile virtual network operation,
   etc, can be influenced by the location of the network functions.  A
   control architecture allowing for inter-operation of NFV and
   transport network (e.g., for combined optimization) is one relevant
   area for research.

4.8.  I2NSF BoF

   The I2NSF BoF aims at defining interfaces to the flow based network
   security functions (NSFs) hosted by service providers at different
   premises.  Network Security Function (NSF) is to ensure integrity,
   confidentiality and availability of network communications, to detect
   unwanted activity, and to block it or at least mitigate its effects.
   NSFs are provided and consumed in increasingly diverse environments.
   Users of NSFs could consume network security services hosted by one
   or more providers, which may be their own enterprise, service
   providers, or a combination of both.  The NSFs may be provided by
   physical and/or virtualized infrastructure.

   Without standard interfaces to express, monitor, and control security
   policies that govern the behavior of NSFs, it becomes virtually
   impossible for security service providers to automate their service
   offerings that utilize different security functions from multiple
   vendors.  Based on this, the main goal of I2NSF is to define an
   information model, a set of software interfaces and data models for
   controlling and monitoring aspects of NSFs (both physical and
   virtual) [I-D.jeong-i2nsf-sdn-security-services].

   Since different security vendors may support different features and
   functions on their devices, I2NSF focuses on flow based NSFs that
   provide treatment to packets/flow.

   The I2NSF WG's target deliverables include: (i) a use cases, problem
   statement, gap analysis document, (ii) a framework document,
   presenting an overview of the use of NSFs and the purpose of the
   models developed by the WG, (iii) a single, unified, Information
   Model for controlling and monitoring flow-based NSFs, (iv) the

   corresponding YANG Data Models derived from the Information Model,
   and (v) an IANA registry consideration for flow-based NSFs
   controlling and monitoring capabilities.  It is also targeted to work
   closely with I2RS, Netconf and Netmod WGs, as well as to communicate
   with external SDOs like ETSI NFV.

   Potential gap: aspects of NSFs such as device or network provisioning
   and configuration are out of scope.

   Potential gap: the use of SDN tools to interact with security
   functions is not explictly considered, but seems a potential
   approach, as for example described for the particular case of IPsec
   flow protection in [I-D.abad-sdnrg-sdn-ipsec-flow-protection].

4.9.  IPPM WG

   The IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) WG defines metrics that can be used
   to measure the quality and performance of Internet services and
   applications running over transport layer protocols (e.g.  TCP, UPD)
   over IP.  It also develops and maintains protocols for the
   measurement of these metrics.  The IPPM WG is a long running WG that
   started in 1997.  The architecture (framework) for IPPM WG metrics
   and associated protocols are defined in RFC 2330 [RFC2330].  Some
   examples of recent output by IPPM WG include "A Reference Path and
   Measurement Points for Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband
   Performance" (RFC 7398 [RFC7398]) and "Framework for TCP Throughput
   Testing" (RFC 6349 [RFC6349]).  The IPPM WG currently does not have a
   charter item or active drafts related to the topic of network
   virtualization.

   Potential gap: There is a pressing need to define metrics and
   associated protocols to measure the performance of NFV.
   Specifically, since NFV is based on the concept of taking centralized
   functions and evolving it to highly distributed SW functions, there
   is a commensurate need to fully understand and measure the baseline
   performance of such systems.  A potential topic for the IPPM WG is
   defining packet delay, throughput, and test framework for the
   application traffic flowing through the NFVI.

4.10.  NFV RG

   The NFVRG focuses on research problems associated with virtualization
   of fixed and mobile network infrastructures, new network
   architectures based on virtualized network functions, virtualization
   of the home and enterprise network environments, co-existence with
   non-virtualized infrastructure and services, and application to
   growing areas of concern such as Internet of Things (IoT) and next
   generation content distribution.  Another goal of the NFVRG is to

   bring a research community together that can jointly address such
   problems, concentrating on problems that relate not just to
   networking but also to computing and storage constraints in such
   environments.

   Since the NFVRG is a research group, it has a wide scope.  In order
   to keep the focus, the group has identified some near term work
   items: (i) Policy based Resource Management, (ii) Analytics for
   Visibility and Orchestration, (iii) Virtual Network Function (VNF)
   Performance Modelling to facilitate transition to NFV and (iv)
   Security and Service Verification.

4.11.  SDN RG

   The SDNRG provides the grounds for an open-minded investigation of
   Software Defined Networking.  They aim at identifying approaches that
   can be defined and used in the near term as well as the research
   challenges in the field.  As such, they SDNRG will not define
   standards, but provide inputs to standards defining and standards
   producing organizations.

   It is working on classifying SDN models, including definitions and
   taxonomies.  It is also studying complexity, scalability and
   applicability of the SDN model.  Additionally, the SDNRG is working
   on network description languages (and associated tools), abstractions
   and interfaces.  They also investigate the verification of correct
   operation of network or node function.

   The SDNRG has produced a reference layer model RFC7426 [RFC7426],
   which structures SDNs in planes and layers which are glued together
   by different abstraction layers.  This architecture differentiates
   between the control and the management planes and provides for
   differentiated southbound interfaces (SBIs).

5.  Summary of Gaps

   Potential Gap-1: as stated in the SFC charter, any work on the
   management and configuration of SFC components related to the support
   of Service Function Chaining will not be done yet, until better
   understood and scoped.  This part is of special interest for
   operators and would be required in order to actually put SFC
   mechanisms into operation.

   Potential Gap-2: redundancy and reliability mechanisms are currently
   not dealt with by SFC or any other WG in the IETF.  While this has
   been the main goal of the VNFpool BoF efforts, it still remains un-
   addressed.

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis Network Virtualization    September 2015


   Potential Gap-3: it would be worthwhile to see if some of the
   specific approaches developed in the NVO3 WG (e.g. overlays, traffic
   isolation, VM migration) can be applied outside the DC, and
   specifically if they can be applicable to network virtualization
   (NFV).  These approaches would be most relevant to the ETSI Network
   Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI), and the Virtualized
   Infrastructure Manager part of the MANO.

   Potential Gap-4: the most relevant activity in BESS that would be
   worthwhile to investigate for relevance to network virtualization
   (NFV) is the extensions to BGP-enabled VPN solutions to support of
   Service Function Chaining.

   Potential Gap-5: in a vEPC/DMM context, how to run the EPC control
   plane on NFV.

   Potential Gap-6: in DMM, on the work item addressing the separation
   of the Control-Plane for mobility- and session management from the
   actual Data-Plane, the actual mappings between these generic protocol
   semantics and the configuration commands required on the data plane
   network elements (e.g., OpenFlow switches) are not currently in the
   scope of the DMM WG.

   Potential Gap-7: network virtualization is not the main aim of the
   I2RS WG.  However, they provide an infrastructure that can be part of
   an SDN deployment.

   Potential Gap-8: VNFPOOL tries to introduce and manage resilience in
   virtualized networking environments and therefore addresses a
   desirable feature for any software defined network.  VNFPOOL has also
   been integrated into the NFV architecture
   [I-D.bernini-nfvrg-vnf-orchestration].

   Potential Gap-9: within the Traffic Engineering Architecture and
   Signaling (TEAS) WG, several use cases in ACTN are relevant to
   network virtualization (NFV) in mobile environments.  Control of
   multi-tenant mobile backhaul transport networks, mobile virtual
   network operation, etc, can be influenced by the location of the
   network functions.  A control architecture allowing for inter-
   operation of NFV and transport network (e.g., for combined
   optimization) is one relevant area for research.

   Potential Gap-10: within I2NSF', aspects of NSFs such as device or
   network provisioning and configuration are out of scope.

   Potential Gap-11: the use of SDN tools to interact with security
   functions is not explictly considered in I2NSF, but seems a potential

   approach, as for example described for the particular case of IPsec
   flow protection in [I-D.abad-sdnrg-sdn-ipsec-flow-protection].

   Potential Gap-12: there is a pressing need to define metrics and
   associated protocols to measure the performance of NFV.
   Specifically, since NFV is based on the concept of taking centralized
   functions and evolving it to highly distributed SW functions, there
   is a commensurate need to fully understand and measure the baseline
   performance of such systems.  A potential topic for the IPPM WG is
   defining packet delay, throughput, and test framework for the
   application traffic flowing through the NFVI.

A.1.  The 3GPP Evolved Packet System

   TBD.  This will include a high level summary of the 3GPP EPS
   architecture, detailing both the EPC (core) and the RAN (access)
   parts.  A link with the two related ETSI NFV use cases
   (Virtualisation of Mobile Core Network and IMS, and Virtualisation of
   Mobile base station) will be included.

   The EPS architecture and some of its standardized interfaces are
   depicted in Figure 6.  The EPS provides IP connectivity to user
   equipment (UE) (i.e., mobile nodes) and access to operator services,
   such as global Internet access and voice communications.  The EPS
   comprises the core network -- called Evolved Packet Core (EPC) -- and
   different radio access networks: the 3GPP Access Network (AN), the
   Untrusted non-3GPP AN and the Trusted non-3GPP AN.  There are
   different types of 3GPP ANs, with the evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio
   Access Network (E-UTRAN) as the most advanced one.  QoS is supported
   through an EPS bearer concept, providing bindings to resource
   reservation within the network.

   The evolved NodeB (eNB), the Long Term Evolution (LTE) base station,
   is part of the access network that provides radio resource
   management, header compression, security and connectivity to the core
   network through the S1 interface.  In an LTE network, the control
   plane signaling traffic and the data traffic ar handled separately.
   The eNBs transmit the control traffic and data traffic separately via
   two logically separate interfaces.

   The Home Subscriber Server, HSS, is a database that contains user
   subscriptions and QoS profiles.  The Mobility Management Entity, MME,
   is responsible for mobility management, user authentication, bearer
   establishment and modification and maintenance of the UE context.

   The Serving gateway, S-GW, is the mobility anchor and manages the
   user plane data tunnels during the inter-eNB handovers.  It tunnels
   all user data packets and buffers downlink IP packets destined for
   UEs that happen to be in idle mode.

   The Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway, P-GW, is responsible for IP
   address allocation to the UE and is a tunnel endpoint for user and
   control plane protocols.  It is also responsible for charging, packet
   filtering, and policy-based control of flows.  It interconnects the
   mobile network to external IP networks, e.g. the Internet.

   In this architecture, data packets are not sent directly on an IP
   network between the eNB and the gateways.  Instead, every packet is
   tunneled over a tunneling protocol - the GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP
   over UDP/IP.  A GTP path is identified in each node with the IP

   address and a UDP port number on the eNB/gateways.  The GTP protocol
   carries both the data traffic (GTP-U tunnels) and the control traffic
   (GTP-C tunnels).  Alternatively Proxy Mobile IP (PMIPv6) is used on
   the S5 interface between S-GW and P-GW.

   In addition to the above basic functions and entities, there are also
   additional features being discussed by the 3GPP that are relevant
   from a network virtualization viewpoint.  One example is the Traffic
   Detection Function (TDF), which can be used by the P-GW, and in
   general by the whole transport network, to decide how to forward the
   traffic.  In a virtualized infrastructure, this kinf of information
   can be used to elastic and dynamically adapt the network capabilities
   to the traffic nature and volume.
