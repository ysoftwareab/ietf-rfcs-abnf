<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Background and Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">Figure 1 illustrates the configuration of a space-based sensor onboard a satellite.  The host is co-located with the radio and connected via a serial link.  Since all clocking is derived from the modem and its serial link, a rate-based application on the host can run at line rate without overwhelming the modem. Furthermore, congestion control is not of concern if the space/ground link is a dedicated, private link.  </p>

<p>Space-based Sensor Satellite</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">Figure 2 illustrates  a wireless modem directly connected to a router.  Because Ethernet interfaces are plentiful and cheap, the modem and router are connected via high-speed Ethernet.  The router needs to know the actual link rate offered by the modem in order to properly set QoS and traffic shaping for that link; simply sending 10/100 Mbps traffic to the modem and having the modem drop most of that traffic, because its outgoing link is slower, is not acceptable.  Traffic flows using TCP will autonomously adapt to rate changes by way of the TCP congestion control algorithms.  Rate-based protocols may not autonomously adapt - particularly if there is no effective way to implement congestion control such as on a unidirectional link.  </p>

<p>Modem/Router Directly Connected</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">It is possible to configure QoS and shaping on the router's Ethernet interface to match the modem's link rate, effectively extending the modem's link an extra hop to the router.  However, such a static configuration is only useful if the modem's link rate is also static. Many modern modems are able to vary their communications according to the channel characteristics they experience, or due to negotiation with the modem at the other end of the link.  Examples include the Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) and Variable Coding and Modulation (VCM) used in DVB-S2, and ADSL2's Seamless Rate Adaptation (SRA).  Link characteristics may also vary due to layer-2 handovers, e.g.  IEEE 802.21 media-independent handoffs.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">The router needs to learn about changes in modem link characteristics in order to vary its QoS and shaping configurations to match the current characteristics and get the most from the modem's link.  The aim is to make the link between router and modem behave as an extension of the modem's own link.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">Consider the topology in Figure 3.  Here, an application is running on a host that is behind the router.  The application needs to know the downlink status of the modem in order to properly shape the data. For example, the application may be a video camera capable of setting the frame rate relative to the available bandwidth. By having the modem advertise its link properties, the application can autonoumously adapt to the offered rate. Note, in this instance, the host and application are one hop removed from the router. Thus, advertisements of modem properties have to be able to pass beyond the link-local network attachment of the modem.  </p>

<p>Generic Single Hop Topology</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">Figure 4 depicts a multi-hop system with one router attached to multiple radios. This configuration shows the need for modem identification, as there may be more than one downstream link that needs to be considered by the router and applications. In addition, the applications that need to shape their traffic are multiple hops from the modems.  Knowing the current data rates and whether or not either link is available can enable the applications to make intelligent decisions regarding traffic shaping and when to send.  For example: one such application may be to implement reactive fragmentation as soon as the link is down in Disconnection/Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN)  <a href="#RFC5050">[RFC5050]</a>.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.p.7">One can replace the modem in Figures 1 through 4 with a cryptographic device and have the same basic problem.  For example, Figure 5 is the same basic scenario as Figure 3. Figure 5 illustrates a cryptographic device directly connected to a router.  Here, both interfaces may be bandwidth with a cryptographic device in between. The cryptographic devices normally operate at line rate.  However, during rekeying the offered rate to the normal traffic may be reduced for a period of time or the tunnels may drop resulting in performance hits or momentary loss of communications. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.8">In other traditional IP cryptos it is hard to sense the real rates offered through &#8220;the system&#8221;. It is feasible for such devices to work this out on their black side &#8211; and the red side  and simply advertise the &#8220;offered rate&#8221;. The black side can obtain knowledge of its downstream link state via modem advertisements, router advertisements or probes and pass this on to the red side via approved methods. The red side can then advertise its rate via the link property advertisment protocol. </p>

<p>Crypto/Router Directly Connected</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.9">The simplest approach to this problem, taken by this draft, is to have the modem advertise its link conditions on its other local interfaces using UDP packets <a href="#RFC0768">[RFC0768]</a> sent to link-local multicast addresses. This approach requires no explicit configuration setup to provide information to connected devices.  UDP is well-understood and widely available, making deployment relatively easy for all types of modems, routers and other connected devices.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.10">To handle advertisements beyond the local interface, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) organizational-scoped multicast and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) site-local multicast MAY be used with no explicit configuration in the modem. Use of IPv4 administratively-scoped  multicast and IPv6 site-local multicast could handle both devices that are directly connected to the modem as well as hosts and applications that are multiple hops away <a href="#RFC2365">[RFC2365]</a> <a href="#RFC2373">[RFC2373]</a>. However, administratively scoped multicast can have some unusual deployments that may result in unforeseen global traffic. For example, in some implementations, site-local is the global corporation. This results in modem adverts suddenly flooding a planet-wide multi-protocol-label-switched net.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.11">Conversly, to handle advertisements beyond the local interface, unicast packets MAY be sent to known hosts.  This does require explicit configuration within the modem, but is simple and straight forward.  The end systems where such configurations apply are not expected to be large or complex and likely to consists of only a handful of hosts/applications.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.12">Link property advertisements SHOULD be sent periodically or as notifications of link-layer events when they happen.  This falls into the scope of DNA [Detecting Network Attachment] processes <a href="#RFC4957">[RFC4957]</a>.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The modem sends UDP updates about changing link and interface conditions (i.e. a link rate changes due to a coding change, or the link and its interface go up or down) to connected devices using link-local multicast packets and to upstream hosts and applications using IPv4 administratively-scoped  multicast and IPv6 site-local multicast packets and OPTIONALLY unicast packets.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">As well as sending on event-triggered updates, the modem SHOULD send periodic advertisements about link conditions, in case new devices have been connected on e.g. a broadcast Ethernet LAN.  These updates are sent over both IPv4 and IPv6.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">This packet can include multiple Blocks containing different information, where each Block is structured as a Type/Length/Data field.  This document defines a single Rate Block which has multiple Link Instance sub-block sections for each input or output interface, each identifying the input or output link interface, and describing the link capacity available (current/maximum/minimum rates in bps).  The diagram below shows an example Rate Block with a single (Incoming) Link Instance. If a modem is both IPv4- and IPv6-capable over its link to the router, this information SHOULD be repeated in IPv4 and IPv6 packets received by the attached device.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">A bidirectional link on the modem will have incoming and outgoing interfaces that MUST share the same local identifier, and SHOULD share the same local IP address.  These interfaces are identified in separate sub-blocks with the I/O flag set appropriately, so that any asymmetry can be described properly.  This means that the unique modem interface identifier would be repeated for each sub-block, where one sub-block describes describes Incoming information, and the other Outgoing information.  The exception to this is if the link is symmetric, as only one sub-block is required with the Bidirectional Flag (B) set to 1. If a link is down, the D flag is taken as 'zero bit rate' and the 'current' rate indicates the last rate before the modem took the link down.  If the minimum and maximum rates are set to zero, this indicates a fixed-speed link whose rate is never altered.  An interface does not have to have any IP address.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">The resource and relative link quality metrics defined in <a href="#RFC5578">[RFC5578]</a> may also be of use.  Unlike [RFC5578], we deliberately define link capacity in exact bps rather than degraded approximate kbps, knowing that for very-low-rate modems, the exact bit rate matters for e.g. call admission control.

<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">An attached device MUST be able to receive link property advertisements via UDP/IP packets sent to the "all routers" multicast address.  Information from this message is used to construct or update the QoS and shape policies applied on the interface for traffic directed through the modem's link.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">An attached router MAY use this information to update its routing table so that the routing information associated with a route through the modem is either deleted or added or updated with a new metric. Changes in the routing table information are then propagated further.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">The modem MAY damp changes to Link Instance information, to prevent advertising transient changes, in line with <a href="#RFC4907">[RFC4907]</a>.  A router MAY also damp responses to frequent changes in Link Instance information received, so that related QoS policies and routing information are not updated until a certain time period has elapsed. This hysteresis would be useful in the case of a rapidly-varying link  rate, where the router would stick to the minimum rate seen.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.4">A router may also use this information as input to e.g. Call Admission Control (CAC) functionality to reserve capacity for calls.

<a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> <a href="#alternatives" id="alternatives">Alternative approaches to the problem</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">The simplest approach to this problem is to have a fixed serial interface between modem and router, with the modem altering the serial rate clock to match the speed of its link, and the router measuring the rate of the received clock.  However, fast serial interfaces are unfashionable, and Ethernet now dominates the world.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">We considered using ICMP <a href="#RFC0792">[RFC0792]</a> <a href="#RFC4443">[RFC4443]</a> to provide this rate information, using the framework for carrying extended information in ICMP messages [RFC4884].  However, this extended information can only be carried in Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded ICMP messages (for both IPv4 and IPv6) and Parameter Problem (for IPv4 only) ICMP messages.  These messages are responses to specific problems, and should not be overloaded for general advertisements. The appropriate ICMP message type would be the obsolete Information Request messge (type 15), though requests are also sent unsolicited for this use. Another factor in preferring UDP over ICMP is that sockets programming for UDP is easier than for ICMP, easing implementation.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">Other approaches to this problem have been proposed. None of these approaches addresses the need to extend the modem advertisement beyond the locally attached device.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.4">The authors have outlined an approach leveraging the Access Node Control Protocol, used in the head-ends of DSL networks, within DSLAMs <a href="#I-D.floreani-ancp-wireless">[I-D.floreani-ancp-wireless]</a>.  However, ANCP is not lightweight and depends on GSMP, which depends on TCP.  The ANCP workgroup is currently focused on the DSL headend, and has yet to extend beyond that environment, while the this link property advertisement proposal is useful at the tail-end in customer networks.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.5">Another approach aimed at improving communication between modems and routers is outlined in <a href="#RFC5578">[RFC5578]</a>.  That approach assumes a PPPoE infrastructure.  PPPoE is not always architecturally suitable to network needs, and requiring PPPoE infrastructure and introducing authentication dependencies for what was just a simple local modem-router (or other attached device) problem is overkill.  That approach may be suitable as an upgrade to existing PPPoE environments.  Adoption of the metrics described in <a href="#RFC5578">[RFC5578]</a> but with communication separate from PPPoE could be very useful for a wider market, and would provide more information than the link rate information outlined in this draft.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.6">The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) <a href="#I-D.ietf-manet-dlep">[I-D.ietf-manet-dlep]</a> also addresses changes in link characteristics such as fluctuations in speed and quality of links due to configuration (in the case of cable/DSL modems), or on a moment-to-moment basis, due to physical phenomena like multipath interference, obstructions, rain fade, etc. DLEP runs between a router and its attached modem devices, allowing the modem to communicate link characteristics as they change, and convergence events (acquisition and loss of potential routing neighbors).  However, DLEP is differs from LPA in the following ways: </p>

<dl>
<dt>1 )</dt>
<dd>DLEP utilizes a session paradigm between the modem device and its associated router.  </dd>
<dt>2 )</dt>
<dd>DLEP assumes that participating modem devices appear to the router as a transparent bridge - specifically, the assumption is that the destination MAC address for data traffic in any frame emitted by the router should be the MAC address of the next-hop router or end- device, and not the MAC address of any of the intervening modem devices.  </dd>
<dt>3 )</dt>
<dd>DLEP is designed to operate only over the local-link and does not accommodate systems that are multiple hops away from the modem.  </dd>
</dl>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.7">Ethernet pause frames have also been suggested as one way of slowing the Ethernet link to match the modem's link a hop further along <a href="#GePause2004">[GePause2004]</a>.  This approach has the disadvantage of being tied to a particular layer-2 technology, while fine-tuning the pause frames to match the modem's offered link rate has the potential to introduce complex control loops and problems as the paused Ethernet rate approximates the modem link rate and interacts with QoS and shaping delay mechanisms on the router.  </p>

It is assumed that unicast would be site local and under the control of the network administrator.  Furthermore, IPsec authentication could be deployed if deemed necessary.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">As multicast packets are sent only to link-local multicast addresses, TTL safeguards such as GTSM <a href="#RFC5082">[RFC5082]</a>, which sets TTL to a hard-to-spoof 255, should be unnecessary.  Deliberately setting a large TTL on any multicast packet would be unwise if it were to be propagated further.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">The decision to use this information more broadly feeds into routing metric updates and policy decisions there; taking the information beyond immediately-connected links becomes a routing problem, and has not been described here.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.4">Some form of authentication of the modem sender is required to prevent spoofing from other local devices.  It should be possible to configure the UDP port number used by the router and modem, to avoid attacks on a well-known port assigned by IANA.  </p>
