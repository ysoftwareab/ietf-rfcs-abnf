  Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) as Transport for Traversal
                     Using Relays around NAT (TURN)
                 draft-petithuguenin-tram-turn-dtls-00

Abstract

   This document specifies the usage of Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) [RFC6347] as a transport protocol between a Traversal
   Using Relays around NAT (TURN) [RFC5766] client and a TURN server.
   It also specifies modifications to the TURN URIs [RFC7065] and to the
   TURN resolution mechanism [RFC5928] to facilitate the resolution of
   TURN URIs into the IP address and port of TURN servers supporting
   DTLS as a transport protocol.

1.  Introduction

   TURN [RFC5766] defines Transport Layer Security (TLS) over TCP
   (simply referred to as TLS [RFC5246]) as the transport for TURN due
   to additional security advantages it offers over plain UDP or TCP
   transport.  But TLS-over-TCP is not an optimal transport when TURN is
   used for its originally intended purpose, which is to support
   multimedia sessions.  This sub-optimality primarily stems from the
   added latency incurred by the TCP-based head-of-line (HOL) blocking
   problem coupled with additional TLS buffering (for integrity checks).
   This is a well documented and understood transport limitation for
   secure real-time communications.

   TLS-over-UDP (referred to as DTLS [RFC6347]) offers the same security
   advantages as TLS-over-TCP, but without the undesirable latency
   concerns.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in ALL CAPS (such
   as "must" or "Must"), they have their usual English meanings, and are
   not to be interpreted as RFC 2119 key words.

Internet-Draft               TURN over DTLS                 January 2014


3.  DTLS as Transport for TURN

   TURN [RFC5766] defines three combinations of transports/allocations:
   UDP/UDP, TCP/UDP and TLS/UDP.  This document adds DTLS/UDP as a valid
   combination.

   [RFC6062] states that TCP allocations cannot be obtained using a UDP
   association between client and server.  The fact that DTLS uses UDP
   implies that TCP allocations MUST NOT be obtained using a DTLS
   association between client and server.

   By default, TURN over DTLS uses port 5349, the same port as TURN over
   TLS.  However, the SRV procedures can be implemented to use a
   different port (as described in Section 6 of [RFC5766].  When using
   SRV records, the service name MUST be set to "turns" and the
   application name to "udp".

4.  DTLS Support in TURN URIs

   This document does not make any changes to the syntax of a TURN URI
   [RFC7065].  As indicated in Section 3 of [RFC7065], secure transports
   like TURN over TLS, and now TURN over DTLS, MUST use the "turns" URI
   scheme.  When using the "turns" URI scheme to designate TURN over
   DTLS, the transport value of the TURN URI, if set, MUST be "udp".

5.  Resolution Mechanism for TURN over DTLS

   This document defines a new Straightforward Naming Authority Pointer
   (S-NAPTR) application protocol tag: "turn.dtls".

   The <transport> component, as provisioned or resulting from the
   parsing of a TURN URI, is passed without modification to the TURN
   resolution mechanism defined in Section 3 of [RFC5928], but with the
   following alterations to that algorithm:

   o  The acceptable values for transport name are extended with the
      addition of "dtls".

   o  The acceptable values in the ordered list of supported TURN
      transports is extended with the addition of "Datagram Transport
      Layer Security (DTLS)".

   o  The resolution algorithm ckeck rules list is extended with the
      addition of the following step:

         If <secure> is true and <transport> is defined as "udp" but the
         list of TURN transports supported by the application does not
         contain DTLS, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.

Internet-Draft               TURN over DTLS                 January 2014


   o  The 5th rule of the resolution algorithm check rules list is
      modified to read like this:

         If <secure> is true and <transport> is not defined but the list
         of TURN transports supported by the application does not
         contain TLS or DTLS, then the resolution MUST stop with an
         error.

   o  Table 1 is modified to add the following line:

                +----------+-------------+----------------+
                | <secure> | <transport> | TURN Transport |
                +----------+-------------+----------------+
                | true     | "udp"       | DTLS           |
                +----------+-------------+----------------+

   o  In step 1 of the resolution algorithm the default port for DTLS is
      5349.

   o  In step 4 of the resolution algorithm the following is added to
      the list of conversions between the filtered list of TURN
      transports supported by the application and application protocol
      tags:

         "turn.dtls" is used if the TURN transport is DTLS.

   Note that using the [RFC5928] resolution mechanism does not imply
   that additional round trips to the DNS server will be needed (e.g.,
   the TURN client will start immediately if the TURN URI contains an IP
   address).

6.  Implementation Status

   [[Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   [RFC6982] before publication.]]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC6982], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

7.  Security Considerations

   TURN over DTLS as a TURN transport does not introduce any specific
   security considerations beyond those for TURN over TLS detailed in
   [RFC5766].

   The usage of "udp" as a transport parameter with the "turns" URI
   scheme does not introduce any specific security issues beyond those
   discussed in [RFC7065].

   The new S-NAPTR application protocol tag defined in this document as
   well as the modifications this document makes to the TURN resolution
   mechanism described in [RFC5928] do not introduce any additional
   security considerations beyond those outlined in [RFC5928].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This specification contains the registration information for one
   S-NAPTR application protocol tags (in accordance with [RFC3958]).

Appendix A.  Examples

   Table 1 shows how the <secure>, <port> and <transport> components are
   populated for a TURN URI that uses DTLS as its transport.  For all
   these examples, the <host> component is populated with "example.net".

   +---------------------------------+----------+--------+-------------+
   | URI                             | <secure> | <port> | <transport> |
   +---------------------------------+----------+--------+-------------+
   | turns:example.net?transport=udp | true     |        | DTLS        |
   +---------------------------------+----------+--------+-------------+

                                  Table 1

   With the DNS RRs in Figure 1 and an ordered TURN transport list of
   {DTLS, TLS, TCP, UDP}, the resolution algorithm will convert the TURN
   URI "turns:example.net" to the ordered list of IP address, port, and
   protocol tuples in Table 2.
