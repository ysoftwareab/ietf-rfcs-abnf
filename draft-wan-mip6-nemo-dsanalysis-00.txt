1.  Introduction

   The primary requirement of the mobile ip technology is to maintain
   the mobile entity's ip address during its movement.  This is a
   network layer solution.  Currently, there are two kinds of network
   layer technology (ipv4 and ipv6).  Accordingly there are two
   protocols for mobile ip solution: mip4 and mip6.  For a long time,
   ipv4 and ipv6 will exist simultaneously, so the mobile entity may
   roam into the ipv4 or ipv6 network during its movement.  However mip4
   protocol can only solve roaming problems in the ipv4-only network,
   and mip6 protocol can only solve roaming problems in the pure ipv6
   network.  To maintain communication in both ipv4 network and ipv6
   network, analysis of dual-stack scenarios and problems is needed.

3.  Scenarios

   Scenarios of mobile entity roaming in both ipv4 and ipv6 [RFC2460]
   network are comprised of entities and their attributes.  Movement of
   a mobile entity in both ipv4 and ipv6 network relates to several
   network entities: Mobile entity (ME), Home agent (HA), Access router
   (AR), Correspondent node.

   Mobile entity (ME):

   the mobile entity may be a mobile node or a mobile router[RFC3963].
   Its attributes are listed below: The attribute ipv4 stack means
   whether the mobile entity supports mip4 protocol[RFC3344].  The
   attribute ipv6 stack means whether the mobile entity supports mip6
   protocol[RFC3775].  The attribute ipv4 home address means whether the
   mobile entity has ipv4 home address.  The attribute ipv6 home address
   means whether the mobile entity has ipv6 home address.  The attribute
   care-of address means the mobile entity's COA type, in ipv6 network
   the mobile entity can get a COA by configuration and in ipv4 network
   the mobile entity can get a co-COA or configured COA.  To roam within
   heterogeneous networks, the mobile entity must have an ipv4 stack and
   an ipv6 stack and it must support both mip4 and mip6 protocols.  If
   the mobile entity has only an ipv4 stack, then it can only roam in
   the ipv4 network, and it acts as a normal mip4 entity.  If the mobile
   entity has only an ipv6 stack, then it can only roam in the ipv6
   network, and it acts as a normal mip6 entity.  Current protocol has
   solved the single stack problem, so in this paper, we assume that the
   mobile entity has both ipv4 and ipv6 stacks and supports both mip4
   and mip6 protocols.  After the mobile entity is booted up, it should
   have at least an ipv4 address or an ipv6 address.  The mobile entity
   will get a care-of address, when it roams into a new network.  If the
   new network is an ipv4 network, the care-of address may be a co-COA,
   and the access router will be a foreign agent to the mobile entity.

   Home agent (HA):

   in the mip6/mip4 protocol, the home agent will relay packets to the
   mobile node.  Its attributes are listed below: The attribute ipv4
   stack means whether the HA has ipv4 stack and supports mip4 protocol.
   The attribute ipv6 stack means whether the HA has ipv6 stack and
   supports mip6 protocol.  The attribute ipv4 address means whether the
   HA has ipv4 address.  The attribute ipv6 address means whether the HA
   has ipv6 address.  The attribute IPv4 address pool means whether the
   HA support the assignment of IPv4 address for the mobile entity.  The
   attribute IPv6 address pool means whether the HA support the
   assignment of IPv6 address for the mobile node.  The home agent must
   have at least an ipv4 stack or an ipv6 stack, and must have at least
   an ipv4 service address or an ipv6 service address.  The home agent

Internet-Draft             dual stack analysis                 June 2006


   may have an ipv4 address pool or an ipv6 address pool.

   Access router (AR):

   the mobile entity will access the network through the access router,
   and the access router may help the mobile entity in communication.
   The access router may be a foreign agent in the mip4 or a router of
   any kind.  Its attributes are listed below: The attribute ipv4 stack
   means whether the access router has ipv4 stack and supports mip4
   protocol.  The attribute ipv6 stack means whether the access router
   has ipv6 stack and supports mip6 protocol.  The attribute ipv4
   address means whether the access router has ipv4 address.  The
   attribute ipv6 address means whether the access router has ipv6
   address.  The access router should have at least a ipv4 or ipv6
   stack, thus it should have an ipv4 or ipv6 address, if it is an ipv4
   access router, it may give the mobile entity a co-COA.

   Correspondent node (CN):

   a node that communicates with the mobile entity.  If the mobile
   entity communicates with the CN with its ipv4 address, then the CN's
   address must be an ipv4 address from mobile entity's perspective.  If
   the mobile entity communicates with the CN with its ipv6 address,
   then the CN's address must be an ipv6 address from mobile entity's
   perspective.  Usually, the dual-stack scenario will not affect the
   correspondent node, if the mobile entity uses the route optimization
   method while communicating with the correspondent node, the
   correspondent may act as the home agent during BU.

   With the analysis of entities and their attributes, we can define the
   dual-stack scenarios.  We assume that the mobile entity has dual-
   stacks and supports both mip4 and mip6 protocols.  If the
   correspondent node supports route optimization method, the attribute
   requirements of CN are similar to home agent.  So we don't consider
   the correspondent node in these scenarios.

   Scenario 1: The mobile entity has dual-stack and supports both mip4
   and mip6, it has an ipv6 home address, but it has no ipv4 home
   address, its home agent has only an ipv6 address, the access router
   has only ipv4 stack and ipv4 address.  The mobile entity has an ipv4
   co-COA.

   Scenario 2: The mobile entity has dual-stack and supports both mip4

4.  Analysis of these scenarios

   If the visited network is an ipv4/ipv6 mixed network, current mip4
   and mip6 protocols are enough to solve the problems, so we assume
   that the visited network is an ipv4 or ipv6 only network.  Based on
   this assumption, these scenarios can be divided into three categories

   In the first category, the home network is an ipv4/ipv6 mixed
   network[DSMIP].  The dual-stack mobile entity with at least an ipv6
   address roams in the ipv4 or ipv6 network.

   In the second category, the dual-stack mobile entity with an ipv6
   home address roams in the ipv4 network.  The home network is an ipv6
   only network.

   In the third category, the dual-stack mobile entity with an ipv4 home
   address roams in the ipv6 network.  The home network is an ipv4 only
   network

   As the ipv4 and ipv6 protocol will exist simultaneously for a long
   time, the three categories of scenarios are all reasonable.

5.  New functions needed in the network

   In the first category, the mobile entity can communicate with the
   home agent by ipv4 or ipv6 protocol, no new facility is needed.

   In the second category, the mobile entity needs to send its ipv6
   binding update to the home agent or the correspondent node from an
   ipv4 only network.

   In the third category, the mobile entity needs to send its ipv4
   binding update to the home agent from an ipv6 only network.

   In these scenarios, mobile entity can not communicate with its home
   agent directly.  The communication between mobile entity and its home
   agent depends on other network facility.  Currently, there are two
   kinds of technologies in the ipv6/ipv4 interconnection field: NAT/PT
   and tunnel.  There are many tunneling technologies for communicating
   between ipv4 and ipv6 network.  Surely, we can use these technologies
   to deal with these scenarios.  There are some other solutions that
   rely on mip4 and mip6 protocols.  Some of these solutions may need

   new facility in the network.  For example, to solve the problems
   involved in the second and third category scenarios, a network
   facility that supports both mip4 and mip6 protocol is needed and a
   solution based on current mip4 and mip6 protocols is needed.

6.  Associated problems

   When the mobile entity with an ipv6-only home network roams into a
   visited network which runs ipv4-only protocol, it can not use mip6
   protocol without tunneling or other support, and it may need new
   facility to tunnel packet from ipv4 network into ipv6 network.  When
   the mobile entity with an ipv4-only home network roams into the ipv6-
   only network, it can not use mip4 protocol without tunneling or other
   support, and it may need new facility to tunnel packet from ipv6
   network into ipv4 network too.  In these scenarios, facility
   discovery, routing mechanism, and binding update mechanism are all
   needed.

   If the mobile entity boots up in the visited network which runs a
   different ip protocol with its home network, current bootstrapping
   technology does not work any more[BOOT].  New protocol is needed.

   When the mobile entity roams from one network into another network
   which runs a different ip protocol, hand over perfermance is very
   important.  And the Fmip6 protocol needs to be extended.  To improve
   hand over perfermance, MIH system may need to consider these
   scenarios.

   As the home network and visited network maybe run different AAA
   protocols, it is a problem of mobile entity to get access service.
   At the same time, the access security may be different from the home
   network.  How to ensure the access security is a problem too.  These
   problems are noncommittal now.
