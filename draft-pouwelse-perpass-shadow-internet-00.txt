1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   The shadow Internet is an alternative communication infrastructure
   specifically crafted to be resiliant to sniffing, blocking, filtering
   and shutdown.  We discuss usage scenarios, architectural requirements
   and how it could be used to combat global surveillance and
   censorship.

   Pervasive monitoring is a widespread attack on privacy [ATTACK].  It
   is defined as widespread (and often covert) surveillance through
   intrusive gathering of protocol artefacts, including application
   content, or protocol meta-data such as headers.  Bits moving across
   the Internet are under surveillance at an unprecedented scale.
   Today, both Internet providers and governments possess the ability to
   monitor the moves of their digital citizens from central
   infrastructure points.  The leaks by Edward Snowden show the
   capabilities of the NSA through their ANT product catalog [CATALOG].
   Internet routers from various vendors are easily compromised in their
   entirety and "taps" may be inserted.  Furthermore, some packets may
   be re-routed to modify them, called man-in-the-middle Internet route
   hijacking.  The challenge is to make global pervasive surveillance
   expensive again.  We need to figure out how to re-engineer the
   internet to prevent this kind of wholesale spying, see [SCHNEIER].

   Censorship is another key threat to The Internet.  We focus on media
   censorship and anonymity.  The largest source of Internet traffic is
   video traffic.  Video is a powerful medium for reaching and
   mobilizing mass audiences, with unique potential to bring about
   social change.  Anonymous video distribution is needed to prevent
   repressive governments from stifling the free exchange of information
   that enables citizens to organize effective political opposition.  As
   such, it constitutes a key tool for allowing populations to establish
   self-governance, and for safeguarding human rights around the world.
   Yet current methods of video distribution are controlled by a small
   number of gatekeepers, and are difficult to access privately or
   anonymously.  Anonymous video distribution depends on technical
   structures to support the building of trust, community, and
   cooperative relationships between users.  Until now, the difficulty
   of confronting this challenge has prevented any system from offering
   an effective solution.

   Servers also cause problems.  Email provider Lavabit is in court



Pouwelse                 Expires August 18, 2014                [Page 3]

   appealing against a government order to hand over its encryption
   keys.  Owners of servers can be forced to cooperate to install a "pen
   register", which tracks communication patterns.  In the case of
   Lavabit, authorities demanded he hand over the encryption keys for
   its entire service and expose all customers.  Essentially, a company
   director can be forced to choose between committing sabotage on their
   own security or goto jail.  Therefore, servers are a key risk factor
   in the shadow Internet architecture.  Servers often keep extensive
   logs, another risk factor.  No privacy exists for the one billion
   regular users of online video.  Rather, their watching patterns are
   meticulously recorded, including what they watched, when they watched
   it, and with whom they shared it.

   We outline scenarios for the shadow Internet and several
   requirements.  A key principle of the shadow Internet is that it
   offers usable encryption without infrastructure.  The shadow Internet
   is required to protect the privacy of its users, allowing them to
   remain anonymous if they wish, or to create digital personas for
   sharing and commenting on videos.  Privacy will be achieved by having
   participants work together, each relaying the encrypted traffic of
   others.  For sustainability, participants will need to relay several
   hours of traffic for each hour of video that they watch, so
   encouraging cooperation is a key part of our scenario.  The presented
   scenarios strongly rely on a sense of community and mutual trust.
   The potential user-base of our system is large: over 6 billion hours
   of video are watched each month on YouTube alone.  Our use-case and
   scenarios are focused on large-scale penetration and uptake.

3.  Real world scenario: Arab Spring context

   Video footage of human rights violations can be a powerful catalyst
   for change.  Graphic depiction of atrocities for a world-wide
   television audience can influence outcomes.  However, global news
   networks need to be able to obtain video footage from a hot zone.

   Governments have demonstrated their ability to disable communications
   networks in times of crisis.  During the 2011 Arab Spring, Egyptian
   authorities demanded that telecommunication companies sever their
   broadband connections and mobile networks--both local and European
   operators were forced to comply, and, as a result, digital Egypt
   vanished.  Despite the country's decentralized infrastructure, an
   Internet blackout was relatively easy to carry out.  The roles and
   consequences of social media (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) during that
   same period further illustrate the capacity governments have for
   Internet censorship and the challenges activists face in combating
   it.  The April 6 Youth Movement from Egypt committed digital dissent
   in full public view.  According to The New York Times[YOUTH], the
   movement "provided a structure for a new generation of Egyptians, who



Pouwelse                 Expires August 18, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               ShadowInternet                February 2014


   aren't part of the nation's small coterie of activists and opinion
   makers, to assemble virtually and communicate freely about their
   grievances."  But moving protest organizations to social media
   accessible to the public-at-large can hold surprising risks.  On the
   ground, the movement's organization of labor strikes and protests in
   Facebook groups, many with thousands of followers, triggered arrest
   and imprisonment.  Protesters in other countries quickly took note of
   Egypt's lesson and disabled their public Facebook profiles.  In
   response, one government initiated social media searches on incoming,
   young, plane travelers by forcing them to login to Facebook upon
   arrival, thereby revealing online activities and any anti-government
   sympathies.[FORCEDLOGIN]

   A glimmer of hope exists.  The Arab Spring shows that a new
   generation is claiming their right to express themselves.
   Microblogging, social media in general and traditional satellite news
   broadcast networks are perceived as critical catalysts for political
   change.  Generic computational fabric is soon getting in the hands of
   two billion people with the growth of smartphones and increasingly
   affordable communication.  These smartphones are increasingly used to
   record and spread disruptive audiovisual material, even in regions
   without media freedom.

   Democratic countries also face a dilemma.  Restrictions on the free
   information flow is the topic of several proposed laws by elected
   representatives.  The strength of copyright law impacts digital
   information flow.  Politicians must decide between weak copyright
   law, as championed by civil rights activists versus strong copyright
   enforcement, as promoted by numerous players in the creative
   industries.  Recent furor around SOPA, PIPA, etc. in the US plus the
   European Parliament vote on ACTA is highly relevant in this context.

   The uniqueness of The Internet lies in the IETF standards.  Moving
   certain bits to certain locations or offering a service requires no
   prior official approval.  However, Internet-deployed mechanisms now
   exist which filter news and media in general for both surveillance
   and censorship.  The Internet has ceased to provide reliable
   transport service for all users.  The IETF can repeat its historical
   inter-networking role again by setting the standard for reliable flow
   of media packets.

4.  Microblogging

   Microblogging is an increasingly popular technology for lightweight
   interaction over the Internet.  It differs from traditional blogging
   in that [OPENMICRO]:





Pouwelse                 Expires August 18, 2014                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               ShadowInternet                February 2014


   o  Posts are short (typically less than 140 characters, which is the
      limit in SMS).

   o  Posts are in plain text, but may contain links to photos or
      videos, often taken and uploaded with a mobile device.

   o  People can reply to your posts, but not directly comment on them.

   o  People learn about your posts only if they have permission to view
      them.

   o  Your microblogging feed is discovered based on your identity at a
      domain or with a service.

   The goal is creating a microblogging standard and facilitating a
   reference implementation for portable devices which is capable of
   operating in a hostile environment.  This standard should be
   resilient against all known forms of censorship.  This proposed draft
   standard SHALL provide: "information dissemination from a single
   smartphone to an audience of millions in the form of microblogging,
   enriched with pictures or streaming video which is guarded against
   all known forms of censorship such as: cyberspace sabotage, digital
   eavesdropping, infiltration, fraud, Internet kill switches, physical
   checkpoints and lawyer-based attacks with the best known protective
   methods".

   The focus on microblogging is driven by feasibility.  Creating a
   standard for overcoming censorship for social networks, search
   engines or web browsing in general is extremely challenging.
   Mitigating the threats posed by Internet kill switches requires focus
   on the most feasible viable standard.  The related work listed in
   this document shows existing operational systems.  Existing systems
   cover all functionality we desire, however none of them cover all
   aspects and little interoperability exists.

   As early as 2006, long before Arab spring events, it was reported
   that individuals in wide swathes of the Arab world were using
   Bluetooth technology to bypass police restrictions.  According to
   news reports[DATING], communication between men and women in this
   region had been made possible by cellphone technology.  When
   Bluetooth-capable phones are in close proximity, they can engage
   directly in digital and social chatter--no other infrastructure is
   needed.  Moreover, when sharing photos or bandwidth-hungry videos
   with friends it also pays to be close.  Government provided cellphone
   networks might not be filtering you, but can still be dreadfully
   slow.  It therefore pays to use cell phones' Bluetooth-based, direct
   file-transfer features--and it comes as no surprise that wireless-
   transfer apps have seen millions of installs.  A query of Google

Internet-Draft               ShadowInternet                February 2014


   Trends for the phrase "Bluetooth transfer" reveals a geographical
   spread of this interesting social phenomenon[TREND].  It seems
   millions of mobile phone owners are already employing the social
   practice of wireless data exchange.  Viability is increased by
   building upon this practice.

5.  Onion routing and bandwidth accounting

   Tor pioneered the technique of relaying traffic to improve privacy
   and security.  We extend their valuable work in our scenarios.
   However, our attacker model differs significantly and our goal is
   robust video streaming, instead of browsing.  Another key difference
   is our focus on communities and utilizing trust between participants.

   Onion routing consumes a lot of bandwidth and processing capacity.
   Within Tor there is no direct rational incentive to operate a relay
   node or exit node.  In our outlined scenario and mechanisms we reward
   cooperating (bandwidth donating) individuals with priority over
   freeriders.  This is an old idea, yet never realized.  Large-scale
   uptake is a key challenge.

   We believe bandwidth accounting is essential for anonymous streaming,
   as it creates an incentive mechanism motivating people to participate
   in a collective system and thus contributing to its sustenance.
   This, in turn, makes pervasive surveillance harder.  Within the
   scenarios we strive to leave out design and implementation details.
   However, incentive compatibility is a MUST HAVE requirement and
   explicitly included.

   In our scenario we assume that it is possible to create and
   distribute proof-of-work certificates.  Such certificates are the
   technological basis for the incentives.  Helping others with becoming
   anonymous through onion routing yields a cryptographically signed
   proof-of-work certificate.  Such proof-of-work certificates somehow
   provide cooperating individuals with priority or faster service.

6.  Driving scenarios

   Recent Arab spring events have shown the power of ubiquitous camera-
   phones, new media and microblogging.  This document proposes to uses
   smartphones, wifi and USB sticks for multimedia transport and
   playback.  The architecture, features and driving scenarios are
   specifically crafted to enable compliant implementations as a single
   smartphone app without any additional server infrastructure.

   Each scenario is focused on certain threats in a hostile environment.
   The adversary becomes stronger in several of the following scenarios
   and we also focus on the social media context.

6.1.  20sec scenario

   First scenario, called "20sec", defines an open microblogging
   standard.  This first scenario duplicates existing microblogging
   practices with an open standard in a fully decentralized setting.
   The scenario requirements are performance equal to central-server
   based approach (e.g. the ability to reach 20 million people in 20
   seconds).

6.1.1.  Adversary model: A simplistic attacker

   Eavesdropping is a common and easy passive attack in a hostile
   environment.  In this scenario we assume the attacker has full access
   to the network between the user and any Internet server.
   Specifically, the adversary can observe, block, delay, replay and
   modify all traffic coming from any server.  Furthermore, all servers
   such as DNS servers, web servers, swarm trackers, CDN cloud servers
   and access portals are assumed to be under direct or indirect control
   of the adversary.

   The adversary cannot compromise traffic between smartphones or other
   participating devices.  The adversary cannot compromise smartphones
   or other participating devices.  The adversary cannot break standard
   cryptographic primitives, such as block ciphers and message-
   authentication codes.

6.1.2.  Scenario details and architectural requirements

   Smartphone owner Alice with wifi-based Internet access records an
   eye-witness video.  She attaches this video to a microblog entry and
   shares the story and the video content automatically with friends Bob
   and Charlie, who are subscribers of her news feed.  Alice does not
   need to trust any central server with her credentials, nor has to
   prove her identity to a central (web) server.  Bob and Charlie are
   both behind a NAT middlebox compliant to the BEHAVE recommendations
   [RFC4787].  No assistance of a coordinating server (e.g.  STUN or
   TURN) is required to traverse this NAT box using UDP messages.  This
   scenario assumes direct or NAT-based Internet access (the next
   scenario deals with packet forwarding).

   Performance should be equal to a central-server based approach,
   providing the ability to reach 20 million people in 20 seconds.  This
   first scenario duplicates existing microblogging practices with an
   open standard in a fully decentralized setting.  The 20sec scenario
   requires that solutions provide seamless backwards compatibility with
   existing leading solutions (e.g.  Twitter, Sina Weibo, chyrp, heello)
   by using content import tools.  Proposed open solutions MUST permit
   easy bulk transcoding and ingest of existing news feeds into this



Pouwelse                 Expires August 18, 2014                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               ShadowInternet                February 2014


   open standard.

   An essential feature of the 20sec scenario is all central gatekeepers
   or communication to them is possibly compromised.  Ownership of data
   is fundamental to autonomy.  To meet the anti-censorship goal, 20sec
   assumes an infrastructure which is not dependent and completely
   decoupled from potentially hostile servers such as DNS servers and
   web servers. 20sec MUST be based on full self-organization.  The
   infrastructure consists purely of devices running compliant
   implementations.  No central server requires installation or
   maintenance, making this infrastructure independent on any type of
   funding or business model. 20sec requires an overlay which is highly
   resilient.  Smartphones, tablets and PCs are able to utilize this P2P
   overlay for microblogging.  Existing solutions such as [OPENMICRO]
   require a central webserver and OAuth-like authentication primitives.
   This prior work is not suitable for our 20sec scenario, as we aim to
   remove all server, ultrapeer or superpeer reliance and equality of
   all participants in the overlay.

   When Alice downloads the smartphone app and runs it for the first
   time, the application performs a bootstrap phase.  On this initial
   startup, the microblogging software looks for at least one other peer
   in the overlay.  The simplest method of bootstrapping is to use a
   list of peers currently online, together with their port number.  See
   the example below.

   # file: Central-Bootstrap-Servers.txt
   # default bootstrap peers
   server1.always-online.org 6420
   host1.never-offline.ro 6420
   sealand.routed.org 6420
   168.0.0.13 6420

   A file sharing program needs a fresh list of peers to bootstrap.
   Thus a pre-defined list of peers is included in the software
   installer.  As peers can go offline it is important that at least one
   peer out of possibly thousands on the list is still online.  This
   pre-existing address list of possibly working peers must therefore
   remain valid for as long as possible.  Bootstrapping is done by
   contacting peers in the list, possibly in parallel.  If a single
   peers replies, the smartphone app of Alice is connected.  Once
   connected, a fresh list of working peer Internet addresses COULD be
   requested.  Several ideas have been proposed on bootstrapping systems
   without an "online bootstrap server" list.  For instance, simply by
   smart brute force pinging, as described by the University of Denver
   [BOOTSTRAP].

   It is RECOMMENDED compliant implementations explore and implement

   efficient alternatives for decentralized initial bootstrapping.

6.2.  Kill-switch scenario

   This scenario describes a situation without any Internet access.  We
   assume the government has essentially "killed" the Internet, in an
   Arab spring like scenario.  It is focused on ad-hoc packet forwarding
   between smartphones.

6.2.1.  Adversary model: An advanced attacker

   The adversary has disabled all Internet-based communication.

   We assume the adversary cannot eavesdrop, jam, delay, replay, modify
   or spoof wireless communication between smartphones.  The adversary
   cannot compromise smartphones or other participating devices.  The
   adversary cannot break standard cryptographic primitives, such as
   block ciphers and message-authentication codes.

6.2.2.  Scenario details and architectural requirements

   Smartphone owner Alice has no Internet access.  She records a video,
   attaches this video to a microblog entry in her phone app.  Friends
   Bob and Charlie are subscribed to her news feed.  Bob and Charlie are
   at some point within range of the wifi, bluetooth or other wireless
   capability of Alice.  This fresh microblog entry plus video is shared
   automatically.  Bob obtained the message from Alice using a
   smartphone app which is periodically scanning if other devices are
   around and if they possibly have fresh news.  This periodic
   synchronization SHOULD be energy-efficient.  Bob sees no noticeable
   decrease in battery lifetime after he obtained unconstrained news
   access.  Charlie later goes to a square where numerous people have
   gathered, most of which are highly interested in the latest videos.
   The fresh messages automatically spreads in this crowd.

   Note that this scenario differs from Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN),
   as being investigated by a Working Group within the Internet Research
   Task Force [RFC4838] and scientists[BUBBLE].  The DTN focus is on
   finding routes to an explicitly given destination, usually by
   maintaining routing tables.  Their system model and terminology
   cannot be applied in our context, for instance, "Endpoint
   Identifiers" which identify the original sender and final
   destination.  In our Internet-Free scenario sender Alice does NOT
   explicitly send a message with destination Bob.

   A wealth of related work exists in this area.  General solutions are
   found in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), which provide self-organized
   IP routing among wireless devices, and delay-tolerant networks (DTN),



Pouwelse                 Expires August 18, 2014               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft               ShadowInternet                February 2014


   which use a simple store-and-forward primitive to communicate over
   heterogeneous links.  Mobile ad hoc networks have been studied within
   the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) since 1997, leading to
   several standards published by the IETF's MANET Working Group, while
   delay-tolerant networks are currently the focus of the IRTF's DTN
   Research Group.  We hope that much of that knowledge can be reused,
   despite our scenario differing slightly from DTN (as being
   investigated by the IRTF [RFC4838])

6.3.  Friend-to-friend scenario

   This third scenario uses friend-to-friend networking to remove the
   requirement for active networking and wifi sensing.  The smartphones
   of Alice and Bob need to be synced manually.  This scenario SHOULD
   deliver a privacy-by-design type of microblogging service.

6.3.1.  Adversary model: A powerful attacker

   We must assume from the Arab Spring scenario the existence of a
   powerful adversary.  For instance, the adversary has disabled all
   Internet-based communication.  The adversary even actively monitors
   wireless communication.  Protocol designers have identified the
   following threats [BRIAR] for similar circumstances:

   o  The adversary can observe, block, delay, replay, and modify
      traffic on the underlying network.  Thus, the microblogging
      service must ensure end-to-end security without relying on the
      security of the underlying network.

   o  Wireless communication is regularly monitored.  Responding to any
      wireless requests from a stranger is a direct threat to the user
      and extremely harmful.

   o  Possession of encrypted electronic messages or encryption
      technology in general is extremely harmful to the smartphone
      owner.

   o  The adversary has a limited ability to compromise smartphones or
      other participating devices.  If a device is compromised, the
      adversary can access any information held in the device's volatile
      memory or persistent storage.

   o  The adversary can choose the data written to the microblogging
      layer by higher protocol layers.

   o  The adversary cannot break standard cryptographic primitives, such
      as block ciphers and message-authentication codes.

   Encryption is not a sufficient requirement of the friend-to-friend
   scenario, everything MUST be hidden.  Possession of smartphones apps
   with encryption is already dangerous for the owner.

6.3.2.  Scenario details and architectural requirements

   Reports from repressive regions indicate that USB sticks are commonly
   used to transport sensitive information.  See for instance this
   extensive report on North-Korea [NKOREA].  In the friend-to-friend
   scenario a network of friends is trusted to transport news manually,
   by simply carrying it around.  Smartphones with NFC capability or
   manual USB transfer are used to duplicate and move messages.  Thus
   Alice delivers her fresh news message to Bob, which is later given
   manually to Charlie.

   As direct social connections are sparse and proximity of friends is
   not continuous, this scenario SHOULD facilitate usage of friends-of-
   friends or further removed social ties to relay news messages.  This
   requires the development of a decentralized social network, for
   instance, with digital signatures of friendship certificates.  In
   effect this would create a "decentralized social network", completely
   autonomous and owned by all participants.  We assume Alice only has
   Bob in her friendlist and Bob only has Charlie in his friendlist.  An
   OPTIONAL feature is that the smartphone apps running on the
   smartphone Alice and Charlie detect that they have friendship path
   through Bob. Fresh news is thus exchanged.

   The interception of a single smartphone MUST NOT expose the app
   itself, any friend list or worse: the entire social network.  We
   assume Alice is placing herself in danger with electronic tools for
   "subversive activities against the democratic republic".  Information
   hiding techniques are essential or even life-critical.  Possibly
   based on Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) protocols [ZEROKNOW].  The
   smartphone app MUST pose as a harmless entertainment feature of a
   smartphone or use another mechanism to become a "stealth app".  The
   requirement of such a stealth app is that a somewhat knowledgeable
   person will not detect the presence of the app and will not discover
   any video content, hence making the app checkpoint-proof.  The app
   itself should be hidden, i.e., it should not be visible in the app
   list of the phone but, for example, be activated by dialing a secret
   telephone number.  In addition, the app should be able to virally
   spread and be able to bypass any governmental restrictions on the
   official app store.

   This scenario requires modification and enhancement based on real-
   world experience from human rights activist [EGYPTSTUDY].

6.4.  Transmorph ability

   Prior scenarios expanded the threat model.  This and the following
   scenarios are focused on the social media context.  News is created
   in a region without freedom and then needs to travel to the outside
   world.  We refer to this simply as the freedom/non-freedom border.
   Different transport protocols, dynamics and different solutions are
   needed on the two sides of this border.

   We now expand the friend-to-friend scenario with a transmorph
   ability, the ability of news to cross the freedom/non-freedom border.

   Alice is a well known blogger in an region with extreme censorship.
   Her identity on Twitter has millions of followers.  However, she has
   no direct ability to reach a Twitter.com server or Internet in
   general.  We assume Alice only has Bob in her friendlist and Bob only
   has Charlie in his friendlist.  Charlie is able to smuggle a
   collection of messages out of the country.  The messages originating
   from Alice should be transmorphed into a series of Twitter post
   belonging to her.

   The identities used in Twitter are highly identifiable labels, with a
   certain trust level.  This hard identity with millions of followers
   is a stark contrasts with anonymity.  Current anti-censorship
   technology lacks the ability to first have stealth encrypted
   transport of news, cross the freedom/non-freedom border and then
   transmorph this news into a public accessible form with a highly
   identifiable label.

6.5.  A single global conversation

   Existing technologies, such as [TOR] in combination with XMPP or the
   Orbot smartphone app facilitate protected point-to-point
   communication.  However, a desired scenario is to facilitate more
   current the Twitter-like social media practices, best typified as a
   "global conversation".

   Furthermore, current social media revolves around video-rich, real-
   time interaction with groups, hashtag-based discovery and social
   networking.  All of these aspects are not offered or are incompatible
   with current-generation of privacy enhancing technology.  More
   knowledge is needed about reputation models in news reporting and
   information flows.  In the current microblogging age, can the number
   of real-person followers be seen as your reputation?  Do several news
   sources of moderate reputation which report the same news story yield
   together an increased reputation score?

   This work should combine privacy enhancement with microblogging.

6.6.  Spammers and hoaxes

   This final scenario is focused on spam.  All technology addressing
   one of the above scenarios MUST also have the capability to deal with
   spam.  Unfortunately, this ability to deal with spam is in conflict
   with simplicity.

   Alice and Bob are exchanging the fresh messages from their social
   network (similar to Internet-free or Friends-only).  Eve is actively
   trying to disrupt the system by injecting news channels with a mix of
   genuine news, obviously fake messages (consuming valuable system
   resources and user attention) and hoaxes.  These falsehoods made to
   masquerade as truth result in erosion of overall trust in the system.

   Systems SHOULD offer capabilities to report spam, mechanisms for fact
   validation and reputations of (pseudo) identities.

7.  Design principles: simplicity and prior success

   Designing and crafting software which is completely self-organizing
   has clear limits [CAPLIMIT] and requires a certain level of expertise
   [LEVELS].  In order to avoid repeating mistakes from the past, this
   document aims to base its design principles on existing new media
   successes.  For microblogging this means following market leading
   solutions and enhance them with censorship resilience.  We recognize
   the following success factors: Simplicity, Real-time responsiveness,
   Near-effortless news creation, News items are bundled in channels,
   combine public broadcasting and person-to-person private messaging,
   following a channel is single direction, more followers yields more
   visibility, keyword search with push of updates and ability to deal
   with spam.

8.  Background rant: lack of coordination and fragmentation

   Computers communicating on equal footing has been part of the IETF
   standards for many decades.  Recently several loosely connected
   standard initiated around explicitly driven by the P2P paradigm for
   applications such as Internet telephony video streaming.  An
   essential problem in this domain is the lack of coordination and
   standard setting for P2P technology.  A large part of the innovation
   around P2P seems to happen in single-person Open Source projects and
   small groups which lack the engineering capacity to make generic, re-
   usable and documented components.  Given their running code-driven
   nature, money and time is not available for attending standards-
   setting meetings, writing formal specifications and defining quality
   control testing suites.  Profit-driven organizations should have the
   resources to overcome these resource shortage issues.  However, due
   to the dynamic, disruptive and litigious nature of P2P few examples

   exist of companies which are capable of supporting an IETF standard
   setting activity for several years.

   As presented during IETF 81 area directorate, there is "not a clear
   long-term architecture yet for you to build actual classes of P2P
   applications using IETF technologies".  Forming an overlay is hard
   and scalable privacy-preserving unstructured search solutions are
   only barely out of the scientific research community.

   From the above we conclude that a key obstacle to the success of this
   proposal is implementation and uptake.  A draft document, active
   community and reference implementation ideally evolve together over
   time.  To overcome this issue a continuous incremental improvement
   approach is advised.  The preferred way is incremental development of
   single a reference implementation, based on free software.

9.  Current running code and related work

   DISCLAIMER: this section needs significant expansion and listing of
   projects with running code and self-organization.

   Several Open Source projects have running code and partially
   implemented the above four scenarios.  We will briefly list them
   here.

   [TOR] A free software implementation of second-generation onion
   routing, a mechanism enabling users to communicate anonymously over
   the Internet.  This flagship project has boosted online anonymity for
   over a decade and is the key example for the cat and mouse dynamics
   of privacy/surveillance technologies.  The Orbot project provides an
   Android implementation of Tor. Due to the usage of the client server/
   model, exit node principle plus lack of reputations this architecture
   is not compatible with our scenarios.

   [DIASPORA] A free personal web platform implementing a distributed
   social networking service.  This partially operational system is
   based on a client/server model and thus not compatible with our ad-
   hoc scenarios.

   [BRIAR] Briar is a secure news and discussion system designed to be
   used by journalists, activists and civil society groups in
   authoritarian countries.  Briar differs from existing circumvention
   tools and mesh networks in three significant ways: needs no external
   infrastructure, can operate over any mixture of available media and
   builds on social relationships.  The aims of this project are similar
   to our scenarios, but this project lacks running code and has few
   active developers.

   [BUBBLE] DTN researchers have simulated closely related scenarios.
   Dissemination in the Arab Spring scenario is likely to involve an
   explicit copy between people who trust each other, referred to as
   social-based forwarding in this study.

   [TWIMIGHT] The Twimight project by ETH-Zurich university shows that
   decentralized microblogging already exists.  Researchers developed an
   Android application that uses Twitter servers in normal conditions,
   but switches to a Bluetooth-based disaster mode when Internet
   connectivity is lost.

   [MUSUBI] The Musubi smartphone app represents another key,
   censorship-free, technology advancement.  Developed by Stanford
   University, it offers instant messaging service and media sharing
   capabilities similar to WhatsApp, Ping, and Blackberry Messenger.
   What makes it unique is that all data and processing resides on the
   smartphones, not in the cloud.  This decentralization removes the
   need for central processing and provides significant decoupling from
   the underlying infrastructure.  Exchange of cryptographic keys is
   integrated in the friending process--Musubi essentially builds a
   decentralized social graph.  Unfortunately, Musubi is also limited--
   all data transfers go through central servers, as it lacks NAT-
   traversal capability.

   [TRIBLER] DISCLAIMER2: this project is coordinated by the author.
   This project has created Open Source firmware for a Samsung Internet-
   connected television which gives it the ability to find, share and
   stream news videos within a fully self-organizing overlay; operated
   only by remote control [REBELLIONTV].  It is also available as
   generic zero-server file sharing software for the PC which has been
   installed by 1.2 million users.  It uses the Dispersy elastic
   database for providing: keyword search, content discovery, content
   voting and spam prevention using crowd sourcing [DISPERSY].  For
   swarm-based streaming and generic message transport it uses the IETF
   protocol developed within the PPSP working group, called Libswift
   [LIBSWIFT].  All this code is created by a single team and
   specifically designed to facilitate evolution into the prior
   described scenarios.  An Libswift demo streaming app is available on
   the Android market.
