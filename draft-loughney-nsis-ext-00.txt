Abstract

   This document discusses the Next Steps in Signaling extensibility
   model.  This model is based upon a two-layer model, where there is a
   transport layer and a signaling application model.  This two-layer
   provides the ability to develope new signaling applications, while
   retaining the use of a common transport layer.

2.  Introduction

   The Next Steps in Signaling Framework NSIS Framework
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-fw] details a basic two-layer framework for signaling
   on the Internet.  The document decomposes signaling into a two-layer
   model, into a generic transport layer and specific signaling layers.

   This model allows for an extensible model for different signaling
   needs on the the Internet.  Currently, the NSIS working group is
   working on two main signaling applications - QoS signaling [I-D.ietf-
   nsis-qos-nslp] and Nat/Firewall signaling [I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw].

   The NSIS Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP) NTLP [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp]
   defines a basic protocol for routing and transport of per-flow
   signaling along the path taken by that flow through the network;
   managing the underlying transport and security protocols.

   Above the NTLP are one or more NSIS Signaling Layer protocols, which
   can signal for things such as QoS, firewall control and NAT signaling
   QoS NSLP [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp], NAT/FW NSLP [I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-
   natfw].  These signaling applications manage their state by using the
   services that the NTLP provides them for signaling.

   This two layer approach allows for signaling applications to be
   developed indepently of the transport.  As it is likely that the
   functionality entities for different signaling applications will be
   distinct, the

3.  NTLP Extensibility

   The NTLP name space, identified by IANA, is divided into ranges.  The
   extensibility rules for the ranges defined in the NTLP space are
   based upon the procedures by which IANA assigns values: "Standards
   Action" (as defined in [IANA]), "IETF Action", "Expert Review", and
   "Organization/Vendor Private", defined below.

   Extensions subject to "IETF Action" require either a Standards Track
   RFC, Experimental RFC or an Information RFC.

   Extensions subject to "Expert Review" refer to values that are to be
   reviewed by an Expert designated by the IESG.  The code points from
   these ranges are typically used for experimental extensions; such
   assignments MUST be requested by either Experimental or Information
   RFCs that document their use and processing, and the actual
   assignments made during the IANA actions for the document.  Values
   from "Expert Review" ranges MUST be registered with IANA.

   "Organization/Vendor Private" ranges refer to values that are
   enterprise-specific.  In this way, different enterprises, vendors, or
   Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) can use the same code
   point without fear of collision.

   NTLP specifies the following registries listed below.

3.1  GIMPS Message Type

   The NTLP common header contains a one-byte message type field
   (initially distinguishing Query, Response, Confirm and Data
   messages).  New message types require Standards Action.

3.2  NSLP Identifiers

   Each signaling application requires one of more NSLPIDs (different
   NSLPIDs may be used to distinguish different classes of signaling
   node, for example to handle different aggregation levels or different
   processing subsets).  An NSLPID must be associated with a unique RAO
   value.  IETF Action is required to allocate a new NSLP Identifier.

3.3  Object Types

   The generic object header as a field which distinguish differentes
   ranges for different allocation styles (standards action, expert
   review etc.) and different applicability scopes (experimental/
   private, NSLP-specific); by default, object types are public and
   shared between all NSLPs.  When a new object type is defined, the
   extensibility bits must also be defined.

Internet-Draft          NSIS Extensibility Model                May 2005


3.4  Extensibility Flags

   The generic object header defined in NTLP contains reserved flag
   bits.  These are reserved for the definition of more complex
   extensibility encoding schemes.  Standards Action is required to
   define new Extensibility Flags.

3.5  Message Routing Methods

   NTLP allows the idea of multiple message routing methods.  The
   message routing method is indicated in the leading 2 bytes of the MRI
   object.  NTLP allocates 2 bits for experimental Routing Methods, for
   use in closed networks for experimentation purposes.  Standards
   Action is required to allocate new Routing Methods.

3.6  Protocol Indicators

   The GIMPS design allows the set of possible protocols to be used in a
   messaging association to be extended.  Every new mode of using a
   protocol is given by a Protocol Indicator, which is used as a tag in
   the Node Addressing and Stack Proposal objects.  New protocol
   indicators require IETF Action.  Allocating a new protocol indicator
   requires defining the higher layer addressing information in the Node
   Addressing Object that is needed to define its configuration.

3.7  Error Classes

   The Error Classes are primarily to aid human or management
   interpretation of otherwise unknown error codes.  These are allocated
   on an Expert Review basis.

3.8   Error Codes

   Error codes are shared across all NSLPs.  When a new error code is
   allocated, the Error Class and the format of any associated error-
   specific information must also be defined.  These are allocated on an
   Expert Review basis.

5.  QoS Model Extensibility

   The QoS NSLP provides signaling for QoS reservations on the Internet.
   The QoS NSLP decouples the resource reservation model or architecture
   from the signaling.  The QoS specification is defined in QSpec
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec].  New QSpecs require IETF action, which defines
   the elements within the QSpec.
