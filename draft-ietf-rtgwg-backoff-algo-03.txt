               SPF Back-off algorithm for link state IGPs
                    draft-ietf-rtgwg-backoff-algo-03

Abstract

   This document defines a standard algorithm to back-off link-state IGP
   SPF computations.

   Having one standard algorithm improves interoperability by reducing
   the probability and/or duration of transient forwarding loops during
   the IGP convergence when the IGP reacts to multiple proximate IGP
   events.

1.  Introduction

   Link state IGPs, such as IS-IS [ISO10589-Second-Edition] and OSPF
   [RFC2328], perform distributed route computation on all routers in
   the area/level.  In order to have consistent routing tables across
   the network, such distributed computation requires that all routers
   have the same version of the network topology (Link State DataBase
   (LSDB)) and perform their computation at the same time.

   In general, when the network is stable, there is a desire to compute
   a new SPF as soon as a failure is detected in order to quickly route

   around the failure.  However, when the network is experiencing
   multiple proximate failures over a short period of time, there is a
   conflicting desire to limit the frequency of SPF computations.
   Indeed, this allows a reduction in control plane resources used by
   IGPs and all protocols/subsystems reacting on the attendant route
   change, such as LDP, RSVP-TE, BGP, Fast ReRoute computations, FIB
   updates... This also reduces the churn on routers and in the network
   and, in particular, reduces the side effects such as micro-loops that
   ensue during IGP convergence.

   To allow for this, IGPs implement an SPF back-off algorithm.
   However, different implementations have choosen different algorithms.
   Hence, in a multi-vendor network, it's not possible to ensure that
   all routers trigger their SPF computation after the same delay.  This
   situation increases the average differential delay between routers
   completing their SPF computation.  It also increases the probability
   that different routers compute their FIBs based on different LSDB
   versions.  Both factors increase the probability and/or duration of
   micro-loops.

   To allow multi-vendor networks to have all routers delay their SPF
   computations for the same duration, this document specifies a
   standard algorithm.  Optionally, implementations may offer
   alternative algorithms.

2.  High level goals

   The high level goals of this algorithm are the following:

   o  Very fast convergence for a single event (e.g., link failure).

   o  Paced fast convergence for multiple proximate IGP events while IGP
      stability is considered acceptable.

   o  Delayed convergence when IGP stability is problematic.  This will
      allow the IGP and related processes to conserve resources during
      the period of instability.

   o  Always try to avoid different SPF_DELAY timers values across
      different routers in the area/level.  Even though not all routers
      will receive IGP messages at the same time, due to differences
      both in the distance from the originator of the IGP event and in
      flooding implementations.

3.  Definitions and parameters

   IGP events: The reception or origination of an IGP LSDB change
   requiring a new routing table computation.  Examples are a topology
   change, a prefix change, a metric change on a link or prefix... Note
   that locally triggering a routing table computation is not considered
   as an IGP event since other IGP routers are unaware of this
   occurrence.

   Routing table computation: Computation of the routing table, by the
   IGP, using the IGP LSDB.  No distinction is made between the type of
   computation performed. e.g., full SPF, incremental SPF, Partial Route
   Computation (PRC).  The type of computation is a local consideration.
   This document may interchangeably use the terms routing table
   computation and SPF computation.

   SPF_DELAY: The delay between the first IGP event triggering a new
   routing table computation and the start of that routing table
   computation.  It can take the following values:

    INITIAL_SPF_DELAY: A very small delay to quickly handle link
    failure, e.g., 0 milliseconds.

    SHORT_SPF_DELAY: A small delay to have a fast convergence in case of
    a single component failure (node, SRLG..), e.g., 50-100
    milliseconds.

    LONG_SPF_DELAY: A long delay when the IGP is unstable, e.g., 2
    seconds.  Note that this allows the IGP network to stabilize.


   TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL: This is the maximum duration typically needed
   to learn all the IGP events related to a single component failure
   (e.g., router failure, SRLG failure), e.g., 1 second.  It's mostly
   dependent on failure detection time variation between all routers
   that are adjacent to the failure.  Additionally, it may depend on the
   different IGP implementations across the network, related to
   origination and flooding of their link state advertisements.

   HOLD_DOWN_INTERVAL: The time required with no received IGP events
   before considering the IGP to be stable again and allowing the
   SPF_DELAY to be restored to INITIAL_WAIT. e.g., 3 seconds.

4.  Principles of SPF delay algorithm

   For this first IGP event, we assume that there has been a single
   simple change in the network which can be taken into account using a
   single routing computation (e.g., link failure, prefix (metric)



Decraene, et al.         Expires January 5, 2017                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           SPF back-off algorithm                July 2016


   change) and we optimize for very fast convergence, delaying the
   routing computation by INITIAL_SPF_DELAY.  Under this assumption,
   there is no benefit in delaying the routing computation.  In a
   typical network, this is the most common type of IGP event.  Hence,
   it makes sense to optimize this case.

   If subsequent IGP events are received in a short period of time
   (TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL), we then assume that a single component
   failed, but that this failure requires the knowledge of multiple IGP
   events in order for IGP routing to converge.  Under this assumption,
   we want fast convergence since this is a normal network situation.
   However, there is a benefit in waiting for all IGP events related to
   this single component failure so that the IGP can compute the post-
   failure routing table in a single route computation.  In this
   situation, we delay the routing computation by LONG_WAIT.

   If IGP events are still received after TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL from
   the initial IGP event received in QUIET state, then the network is
   presumably experiencing multiple independent failures.  In this case,
   while waiting for network stability, the computations are delayed for
   a longer time represented by LONG_SPF_DELAY.  This SPF delay is kept
   until no IGP events are received for HOLDDOWN_INTERVAL.

   Note that previous SPF delay algorithms used to count the number of
   SPF computations.  However, as all routers may receive the IGP events
   at different times, we cannot assume that all routers will perform
   the same number of SPF computations or that they will schedule them
   at the same time.  For example, assuming that the SPF delay is 50 ms,
   router R1 may receive 3 IGP events (E1, E2, E3) in those 50 ms and
   hence will perform a single routing computation.  While another
   router R2 may only receive 2 events (E1, E2) in those 50 ms and hence
   will schedule another routing computation when receiving E3.  That's
   why this document uses a time (TIME_TO_LEARN) from the initial event
   detection/reception as opposed to counting the number of SPF
   computations to determine when the IGP is unstable.

5.  Specification of the SPF delay state machine

5.1.  States

   This section describes the state machine.  The naming and semantics
   of each state corresponds directly to the SPF delay used for IGP
   events received in that state.  Three states are defined:

   QUIET: This is the initial state, when no IGP events have occured for
   at least HOLDDOWN_INTERVAL since the previous routing table
   computation.  The state is meant to handle link failures very
   quickly.

Internet-Draft           SPF back-off algorithm                July 2016


   SHORT_WAIT: State entered when an IGP event has been received in
   QUIET state and exited when no IGP events have been received for
   HOLDDOWN_TIMER.  This state is meant to handle single component
   failure requiring multiple IGP events (e.g., node, SRLG).

   LONG_WAIT: State reached after TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL.  In other
   words, state reached after TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL in state
   SHORT_WAIT.  This state is meant to handle multiple independent
   component failures during periods of IGP instability.

5.2.  States Transitions

   The FSM is initialized to the QUIET_STATE with all three timers
   deactivated.  The following diagram describes briefly the state
   transitions.

6.  Parameters

   All the parameters MUST be configurable.  All the delays
   (INITIAL_SPF_DELAY, SHORT_SPF_DELAY, LONG_SPF_DELAY,
   TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL, HOLD_DOWN_INTERVAL) SHOULD be configurable at
   the millisecond granularity.  They MUST be configurable at least at
   the tenth of second granularity.  The configurable range for all the
   parameters SHOULD at least be from 0 milliseconds to 60 seconds.

   This document does not propose default values for the parameters
   because these values are expected to be context dependent.
   Implementations are free to propose their own default values.

   When setting (default) values, one SHOULD consider the customers and
   their application requirements, the computational power of the
   routers, the size of the network, and, in particular, the number of
   IP prefixes advertised in the IGP, the frequency and number of IGP
   events, the number of protocols reactions/computations triggered by
   IGP SPF (e.g., BGP, PCEP, Traffic Engineering CSPF, Fast ReRoute
   computations).

   Note that some or all of these factors may change over the life of
   the network.  In case of doubt, it's RECOMMENDED to play it safe and
   start with safe, i.e., longer timers.

   For the standard algorithm to be effective in mitigating micro-loops,
   it is RECOMMENDED that all routers in the IGP domain, or at least all
   the routers in the same area/level, have exactly the same configured
   values.

7.  Impact on micro-loops

   Micro-loops during IGP convergence are due to a non-synchronized or
   non-ordered update of the forwarding information tables (FIB)
   [RFC5715] [RFC6976] [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-spf-uloop-pb-statement].  FIBs
   are installed after multiple steps such as SPF wait time, SPF
   computation, FIB distribution, and FIB update.  This document only
   addresses the first contribution.  This standardized procedure
   reduces the probability and/or duration of micro-loops when IGPs
   experience multiple proximate events.  It does not prevent all micro-
   loops.  However, it is beneficial and is less complex and costly to
   implement when compared to full solutions such as [RFC5715] or
   [RFC6976].

8.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions required.

9.  Security considerations

   The algorithm presented in this document does not compromise IGP
   security.  An attacker having the ability to generate IGP events
   would be able to delay the IGP convergence time.  The LONG_SPF_DELAY
   state may help mitigate the effects of Denial-of-Service (DOS)
   attacks generating many IGP events.
