<h1><br />Packet Loss and Delay
    Measurement for MPLS Networks<br />draft-frost-mpls-loss-delay-00</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Many service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the
      ability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet loss and
      one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such as delay
      variation and channel throughput.  This capability, in addition,
      provides operators with greater visibility into the performance
      characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating planning,
      troubleshooting, and evaluation.  This document specifies protocol
      mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate measurement of these
      performance metrics in MPLS networks.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Many service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the
      ability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet loss and
      one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such as delay
      variation and channel throughput.  This capability, in addition,
      provides operators with greater visibility into the performance
      characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating planning,
      troubleshooting, and evaluation.  This document specifies protocol
      mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate measurement of these
      performance metrics in MPLS networks.
</p>
<p>This document specifies two closely-related protocols, one for packet
      loss measurement (LM) and one for packet delay measurement (DM).  These
      protocols have the following characteristics and capabilities:
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The LM and DM protocols are intended to be simple and to support
          efficient hardware processing.
</li>
<li>The LM and DM protocols operate over the MPLS Generic Associated
          Channel (G-ACh) <a class='info' href='#RFC5586'>[RFC5586]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bocci, M., Vigoureux, M., and S. Bryant, &ldquo;MPLS Generic Associated Channel,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> and support measurement of
          loss and delay over Label Switched Paths (LSPs), pseudowires, and
          MPLS sections (links).
</li>
<li>The LM and DM protocols are applicable to the LSPs, pseudowires,
          and sections of networks based on the MPLS Transport Profile
          (MPLS-TP), because the MPLS-TP is based on a standard MPLS data
          plane.  The MPLS-TP is defined and described in <a class='info' href='#RFC5921'>[RFC5921]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bocci, M., Bryant, S., Frost, D., Levrau, L., and L. Berger, &ldquo;A Framework for MPLS in Transport Networks,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>, and MPLS-TP LSPs, pseudowires, and sections are
          discussed in detail in <a class='info' href='#RFC5960'>[RFC5960]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Frost, D., Bryant, S., and M. Bocci, &ldquo;MPLS Transport Profile Data Plane Architecture,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>The LM and DM protocols can be used for both continuous/proactive
          and selective/on-demand measurement.
</li>
<li>The LM and DM protocols use a simple query/response model for
          bidirectional measurement that allows a single node - the querier -
          to measure the loss or delay in both directions.
</li>
<li>The LM and DM protocols use query messages for unidirectional
          loss and delay measurement.  The measurement can either be carried
          out at the downstream node(s) or at the querier if an out-of-band
          return path is available.
</li>
<li>The LM and DM protocols do not require that the transmit and
          receive interfaces be the same when performing bidirectional
          measurement.
</li>
<li>The DM protocol is stateless.
</li>
<li>The LM protocol is "almost" stateless: loss is computed as a
          delta between successive messages, and thus the data associated with
          the last message received must be retained.
</li>
<li>The LM protocol can perform two distinct kinds of loss
          measurement: it can measure the loss of specially generated test
          packets in order to infer the approximate data-plane loss level
          (inferred measurement); or it can directly measure data-plane packet
          loss (direct measurement).  Direct measurement provides perfect loss
          accounting, but may require specialized hardware support and is only
          applicable to some LSP types.  Inferred measurement provides only
          approximate loss accounting but is generally applicable.
</li>
<li>The LM protocol supports both 32-bit and 64-bit packet
          counters.
</li>
<li>The LM protocol supports measurement in terms of both packet
          counts and octet counts.
</li>
<li>The LM protocol can be used to measure channel throughput as well
          as packet loss.
</li>
<li>The DM protocol supports multiple timestamp formats, and provides
          a simple means for the two endpoints of a bidirectional connection
          to agree on a preferred format.  This procedure reduces to a
          triviality for implementations supporting only a single timestamp
          format.
</li>
<li>The DM protocol supports varying the measurement message size in
          order to measure delays associated with different packet sizes.
</li>
</ul><p>

Overview</h3>

<p>This section begins with a summary of the basic methods used for the
      bidirectional measurement of packet loss and delay.  These measurement
      methods are then described in detail.  Finally a list of practical
      considerations are discussed that may come into play to inform or modify
      these simple procedures.
</p>
<p>The following figure shows the reference scenario.

<p>The figure shows a bidirectional channel between two nodes, A and B,
      and illustrates the temporal reference points T1-T4 associated with a
      measurement operation that takes place at A. The operation consists of A
      sending a query message to B, and B sending back a response. Each
      reference point indicates the point in time at which either the query or
      the response message is transmitted or received over the channel.
</p>
<p>In this situation, A can arrange to measure the packet loss over the
      channel in the forward and reverse directions by sending Loss
      Measurement (LM) query messages to B each of which contains the count of
      packets transmitted prior to time T1 over the channel to B (A_TxP).
      When the message reaches B, it appends two values and reflects the
      message back to A: the count of packets received prior to time T2 over
      the channel from A (B_RxP), and the count of packets transmitted
      prior to time T3 over the channel to A (B_TxP). When the response
      reaches A, it appends a fourth value, the count of packets received
      prior to time T4 over the channel from B (A_RxP).
</p>
<p>These four counter values enable A to compute the desired loss
      statistics. Because the transmit count at A and the receive count at B
      (and vice versa) may not be synchronized at the time of the first
      message, and to limit the effects of counter wrap, the loss is computed
      in the form of a delta between messages.
</p>
<p>To measure at A the delay over the channel to B, a Delay
      Measurement (DM) query message is sent from A to B containing a
      timestamp recording the instant at which it is transmitted,
      i.e.&nbsp;T1. When the message reaches B, a timestamp is added recording
      the instant at which it is received (T2). The message can now be
      reflected from B to A, with B adding its transmit timestamp (T3) and A
      adding its receive timestamp (T4). These four timestamps enable A to
      compute the one-way delay in each direction, as well as the two-way
      delay for the channel. The one-way delay computations require that
      the clocks of A and B be synchronized; mechanisms for clock
      synchronization are outside the scope of this document.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Packet Loss Measurement</h3>

<p>Suppose a bidirectional channel exists between the nodes A and B. The
        objective is to measure at A the following two quantities associated
        with the channel: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>A_TxLoss (transmit loss): the number of packets transmitted by
            A over the channel but not received at B;
</p>
<p>A_RxLoss (receive loss): the number of packets transmitted by B
            over the channel but not received at A.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is accomplished by initiating a Loss Measurement (LM)
        operation at A, which consists of transmission of a sequence of LM
        query messages (LM[1], LM[2], ...) over the channel at a specified
        rate, such as one every 100 milliseconds. Each message LM[n] contains
        the following value: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>A_TxP[n]: the total count of packets transmitted by A over the
            channel prior to the time this message is transmitted.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When such a message is received at B, the following value is
        recorded in the message: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>B_RxP[n]: the total count of packets received by B over the
            channel at the time this message is received (excluding the
            message itself).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, B inserts an appropriate response code into the
        message and transmits it back to A, recording within it the following
        value: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>B_TxP[n]: the total count of packets transmitted by B over the
            channel prior to the time this response is transmitted.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the message response is received back at A, the following
        value is recorded in the message: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>A_RxP[n]: the total count of packets received by A over the
            channel at the time this response is received (excluding the
            message itself).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The transmit loss A_TxLoss[n-1,n] and receive loss A_RxLoss[n-1,n]
        within the measurement interval marked by the messages LM[n-1] and
        LM[n] are computed by A as follows:
</p>
<p>A_TxLoss[n-1,n] = (A_TxP[n] - A_TxP[n-1]) - (B_RxP[n] - B_RxP[n-1])
        <br />
 A_RxLoss[n-1,n] = (B_TxP[n] - B_TxP[n-1]) - (A_RxP[n] -
        A_RxP[n-1])
</p>
<p>where the arithmetic is modulo the counter size.
</p>
<p>The derived values </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>A_TxLoss = A_TxLoss[1,2] + A_TxLoss[2,3] + ...
</p>
<p>A_RxLoss = A_RxLoss[1,2] + A_RxLoss[2,3] + ...
</p>
</blockquote><p> are updated each time a response to an LM message is
        received and processed, and represent the total transmit and receive
        loss over the channel since the LM operation was initiated.
</p>
<p>When computing the values A_TxLoss[n-1,n] and A_RxLoss[n-1,n] the
        possibility of counter wrap must be taken into account. Consider for
        example the values of the A_TxP counter at sequence numbers n-1 and
        n. Clearly if A_TxP[n] is allowed to wrap to 0 and then beyond to a
        value equal to or greater than A_TxP[n-1], the computation of an
        unambiguous A_TxLoss[n-1,n] value will be impossible. Therefore the LM
        message rate MUST be sufficiently high, given the counter size and the
        speed and minimum packet size of the underlying channel, that this
        condition cannot arise. For example, a 32-bit counter for a 100 Gbps
        link with a minimum packet size of 64 bytes can wrap in 2^32 /
        (10^11/(64*8)) = ~22 seconds, which is therefore an upper bound on the
        LM message interval under such conditions.  This bound will be
        referred to as the MaxLMInterval of the channel.  It is clear that the
        MaxLMInterval will be a more restrictive constraint in the case of
        direct LM and for smaller counter sizes.
</p>
<p>The loss measurement approach described in this section has the
        characteristic of being stateless at B and "almost" stateless at A.
        Specifically, A must retain the data associated with the last LM
        response received, in order to use it to compute loss when the next
        response arrives.  This data MAY be discarded, and MUST NOT be used as
        a basis for measurement, if MaxLMInterval elapses before the next
        response arrives, because in this case an unambiguous measurement
        cannot be made.
</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion has assumed the counted objects are
        packets, but this need not be the case.  In particular, octets may be
        counted instead.  This will, of course, reduce the MaxLMInterval
        proportionately.

Throughput Measurement</h3>

<p>If LM query messages contain a timestamp recording their time of
        transmission, this data can be combined with the packet or octet
        counts to yield a measurement of the throughput sustained over the
        channel during the interval.  This metric can be called the delivered
        throughput.  As for loss measurement, the interval counts can be
        accumulated to arrive at the delivered throughput of the channel since
        the start of the measurement operation.  This procedure also enables
        out-of-service throughput testing when combined with a simple packet
        generator.

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Delay Measurement</h3>

<p>Suppose a bidirectional channel exists between the nodes A and B. The
        objective is to measure at A one or more of the following quantities
        associated with the channel: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The one-way delay associated with the forward (A to B)
            direction of the channel;
</li>
<li>The one-way delay associated with the reverse (B to A)
            direction of the channel;
</li>
<li>The two-way delay (A to B to A) associated with the
            channel.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of two-way delay, there are actually two possible
        metrics of interest.  The "strict" two-way delay is the sum of the
        one-way delays in each direction and reflects the two-way delay of the
        channel itself, irrespective of processing delays within the remote
        endpoint B.  The "loose" two-way delay includes in addition any delay
        associated with remote endpoint processing.
</p>
<p>Measurement of the one-way delay quantities requires that the
        clocks of A and B be synchronized, whereas the two-way delay can be
        measured directly even when this is not the case (provided A and B
        have stable clocks).
</p>
<p>The measurement is accomplished by sending a Delay Measurement (DM)
        query message over the channel to B which contains the following
        timestamp: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>T1: the time the DM query message is transmitted from A.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the message arrives at B, the following timestamp is recorded
        in the message: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>T2: the time the DM query message is received at B.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point B inserts an appropriate response code into the
        message and transmits it back to A, recording within it the following
        timestamp: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>T3: the time the DM response message is transmitted from B.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the message arrives back at A, the following timestamp is
        recorded in the message: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>T4: the time the DM response message is received back at A.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, A can compute the strict two-way delay associated with the
        channel as
          </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>strict two-way delay = (T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2)
</p>
</blockquote><p>
        and the loose two-way delay as
          </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>loose two-way delay = T4 - T1.
</p>
</blockquote><p>
        
</p>
<p>If the clocks of A and B are known at A to be synchronized, then
        both one-way delay values, as well as the strict two-way delay, can be
        computed at A as
          </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>forward one-way delay = T2 - T1
</p>
<p>reverse one-way delay = T4 - T3
</p>
<p>strict two-way delay = forward delay + reverse delay.
</p>

Delay Variation Measurement</h3>

<p>Packet Delay Variation (PDV) <a class='info' href='#RFC3393'>[RFC3393]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Demichelis, C. and P. Chimento, &ldquo;IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> is another
        performance metric important in some applications. The PDV of a pair
        of packets within a stream of packets is defined for a selected pair
        of packets in the stream going from measurement point 1 to measurement
        point 2. The PDV is the difference between the one-way delay of the
        selected packets.
</p>
<p>A PDV measurement can therefore be derived from successive delay
        measurements obtained through the procedures in <a class='info' href='#ov_delay'>Section&nbsp;2.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Delay Measurement</span><span>)</span></a>. An important point regarding PDV measurement,
        however, is that it can be carried out based on one-way delay
        measurements even when the clocks of the two systems involved in those
        measurements are not synchronized.

<a name="rfc.section.2.5"></a><h3>2.5.&nbsp;
Unidirectional Measurement</h3>

<p>In the case that the channel from A to (B1, ..., Bk) is
        unidirectional, i.e.&nbsp;is a unidirectional LSP, LM and DM
        measurements can be carried out at B1, ..., Bk instead of at A.
</p>
<p>For LM this is accomplished by initiating an LM operation at A and
        carrying out the same procedures as for bidirectional channels,
        except that no responses from B1, ..., Bk to A are generated. Instead,
        each terminal node B uses the A_TxP and B_RxP values in the LM
        messages it receives to compute the receive loss associated with the
        channel in essentially the same way as described previously,
        i.e.
</p>
<p>B_RxLoss[n-1,n] = (A_TxP[n] - A_TxP[n-1]) - (B_RxP[n] -
        B_RxP[n-1])
</p>
<p>For DM, of course, only the forward one-way delay can be measured
        and the clock synchronization requirement applies.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if an out-of-band channel from a terminal node B
        back to A is available, the LM and DM message responses can be
        communicated to A via this channel so that the measurements can be
        carried out at A.

<a name="rfc.section.2.6"></a><h3>2.6.&nbsp;
Loopback Measurement</h3>

<p>Some bidirectional channels may be placed into a loopback state
        such that query messages are looped back to the querier without
        modification.  In this situation, LM and DM procedures can be used to
        carry out measurements associated with the circular path.
</p>
<p>For LM, the loss computation in this case is:
</p>
<p>A_Loss[n-1,n] = (A_TxP[n] - A_TxP[n-1]) - (A_RxP[n] - A_RxP[n-1])
</p>
<p>For DM, the loose two-way delay is computed.  In this case,
        however, the remote endpoint processing time component reflects only
        the time required to loop the message from channel input to channel
        output.
</p>
<p>Query messages must include some form of source identifier in order
        for looped-back queries to be differentiated from queries initiated by
        the far end.

Types of Channels</h3>

<p>There are several types of channels in MPLS networks over which
          loss and delay measurement may be conducted.  The channel type may
          restrict the kinds of measurement that can be performed.  In all
          cases, LM and DM messages flow over the MPLS Generic Associated
          Channel (G-ACh), which is described in detail in <a class='info' href='#RFC5586'>[RFC5586]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bocci, M., Vigoureux, M., and S. Bryant, &ldquo;MPLS Generic Associated Channel,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Broadly, a channel in an MPLS network may be either a link, a
          Label Switched Path (LSP) <a class='info' href='#RFC3031'>[RFC3031]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, E., Viswanathan, A., and R. Callon, &ldquo;Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>, or a pseudowire
          <a class='info' href='#RFC3985'>[RFC3985]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryant, S. and P. Pate, &ldquo;Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Architecture,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Links are bidirectional and are also
          referred to as MPLS sections; see <a class='info' href='#RFC5586'>[RFC5586]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bocci, M., Vigoureux, M., and S. Bryant, &ldquo;MPLS Generic Associated Channel,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> and

          Switched Paths may be either unidirectional or bidirectional.
</p>
<p>The LM and DM protocols discussed in this document are initiated
          from a single node, the querier.  A query message may be received
          either by a single node or by multiple nodes, depending on the
          nature of the channel.  In the latter case these protocols provide
          point-to-multipoint measurement capabilities.

Quality of Service</h3>

<p>Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities, in the form of the

          <a class='info' href='#RFC3270'>[RFC3270]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Le Faucheur, F., Wu, L., Davie, B., Davari, S., Vaananen, P., Krishnan, R., Cheval, P., and J.

Asati, &ldquo;Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Stack Entry: &quot;EXP&quot; Field Renamed to &quot;Traffic Class&quot; Field,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Different
          classes of traffic are distinguished by the three-bit Traffic Class
          (TC) field of an MPLS Label Stack Entry (LSE).  Delay measurement
          therefore applies on a per-traffic-class basis, and the TC values of
          LSEs above the G-ACh Label (GAL) that precedes a DM message are
          significant.  Packet loss can be measured with respect either to the
          channel as a whole or to a specific traffic class.
</p>
<p>Another aspect of packet processing which often arises in the
          context of QoS concerns the location of the measurement points for
          loss and delay within the sending and receiving nodes, which is
          implementation-dependent.  For example, a sending implementation may
          or may not consider a packet to be "lost", for LM purposes, that was
          discarded prior to transmission for queuing-related reasons;
          conversely, a receiving implementation may or may not consider a
          packet to be "lost", for LM purposes, if it was physically received
          but discarded during receive-path processing.  The location of delay
          measurement points similarly impacts what, precisely, is being
          measured.  The principal consideration here is that the behavior of
          an implementation in these respects SHOULD be made clear to the
          user.

Equal Cost Multipath</h3>

<p>Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) is the behavior of distributing
          packets across multiple alternate paths toward a destination.  The
          use of ECMP in MPLS networks is described in BCP 128 <a class='info' href='#RFC4928'>[RFC4928]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Swallow, G., Bryant, S., and L. Andersson, &ldquo;Avoiding Equal Cost Multipath Treatment in MPLS Networks,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.  The typical result of ECMP being performed on
          an LSP which is subject to delay measurement will be that only the
          delay of one of the available paths is and can be measured.

<p>The effects of ECMP on loss measurement will depend on the LM
          mode.  In the case of direct LM, the measurement will account for
          any packets lost between the sender and the receiver, regardless of
          how many paths exist between them.  However, the presence of ECMP
          increases the likelihood of misordering both of LM messages relative
          to data packets, and of the LM messages themselves.  Such
          misorderings tend to create unmeasurable intervals and thus degrade
          the accuracy of loss measurement.  The effects of ECMP are similar
          for inferred LM, with the additional caveat that, unless the test
          packets are specially constructed so as to probe all available
          paths, the loss characteristics of one or more of the alternate
          paths cannot be accounted for.

<a name="rfc.section.2.7.4"></a><h3>2.7.4.&nbsp;
Intermediate Nodes</h3>

<p>In the case of an LSP, it may be desirable to measure the loss or
          delay to or from an intermediate node as well as between LSP
          endpoints.  This can be done in principle by setting the Time to
          Live (TTL) field in the outer LSE appropriately when targeting a
          measurement message to an intermediate node.  This procedure may
          fail, however, if hardware-assisted measurement is in use, because
          the processing of the packet by the intermediate node occurs only as
          the result of TTL expiry, and the handling of TTL expiry may occur
          at a later processing stage in the implementation than the
          hardware-assisted measurement function.  Often the motivation for
          conducting measurements to intermediate nodes is an attempt to
          localize a problem that has been detected on the LSP.  In this case,
          if intermediate nodes are not capable of performing
          hardware-assisted measurement, a less accurate - but usually
          sufficient - software-based measurement can be conducted
          instead.

          additional considerations, however, do apply in this case:
            </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If different clocks are associated with transmit and receive

Loss Measurement Modes</h3>

<p>The summary of loss measurement at the beginning of <a class='info' href='#ov'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overview</span><span>)</span></a> above made reference to the "count of packets"
          transmitted and received over a channel.  If the counted packets are
          the packets flowing over the channel in the data plane, the loss
          measurement is said to operate in "direct mode".  If, on the other
          hand, the counted packets are selected control packets from which
          the approximate loss characteristics of the channel are being
          inferred, the loss measurement is said to operate in "inferred
          mode".
</p>
<p>Direct LM has the advantage of being able to provide perfect loss
          accounting when it is available.  There are, however, several
          limitations associated with direct LM.
</p>
<p>For accurate direct LM to occur, packets must not be sent between
          the time the transmit count for an outbound LM message is determined
          and the time the message is actually transmitted.  Similarly,
          packets must not be received and processed between the time an LM
          message is received and the time the receive count for the message
          is determined.  If these "synchronization conditions" do not hold,
          the LM message counters will not reflect the true state of the data
          plane, with the result that, for example, the receive count of B may
          be greater than the transmit count of A, and attempts to compute
          loss by taking the difference will yield an invalid result.  This
          requirement for synchronization between LM message counters and the
          data plane may require special support from hardware-based
          forwarding implementations.
</p>
<p>Another limitation of direct LM is that it may be difficult or
          impossible to apply in cases where the channel is an LSP and the LSP
          label at the receiver is either nonexistent or fails to identify a
          unique sending node.  The first case happens when Penultimate Hop
          Popping (PHP) is used on the LSP, and the second case generally
          holds for LSPs based on the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) <a class='info' href='#RFC5036'>[RFC5036]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andersson, L., Minei, I., and B. Thomas, &ldquo;LDP Specification,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> as opposed to, for example, those based on
          Traffic Engineering extensions to the Resource Reservation Protocol
          (RSVP-TE) <a class='info' href='#RFC3209'>[RFC3209]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Awduche, D., Berger, L., Gan, D., Li, T., Srinivasan, V., and G. Swallow, &ldquo;RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>.  These conditions may make it
          infeasible for the receiver to identify the data-plane packets
          associated with a particular source and LSP in order to count them,
          or to infer the source and LSP context associated with an LM
          message.
</p>
<p>Inferred LM works in the same manner as direct LM except that the
          counted packets are special control packets, called test messages,
          generated by the sender.  Test messages may be either packets
          explicitly constructed and used for LM or packets with a different
          primary purpose, such as those associated with a Bidirectional
          Forwarding Detection (BFD) <a class='info' href='#RFC5884'>[RFC5884]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aggarwal, R., Kompella, K., Nadeau, T., and G. Swallow, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> session.
</p>
<p>The synchronization conditions discussed above for direct LM also
          apply to inferred LM, the only difference being that the required
          synchronization is now between the LM counters and the test message
          generation process.  Protocol and application designers MUST take
          these synchronization requirements into account when developing
          tools for inferred LM, and make their behavior in this regard clear
          to the user.
</p>
<p>Inferred LM provides only an approximate view of the loss level
          associated with a channel, but is typically applicable even in cases
          where direct LM is not.

Loss Measurement Scope</h3>

<p>In the case of direct LM, where data-plane packets are counted,
          there are different possibilities for which kinds of packets are
          included in the count and which are excluded.  The set of packets
          counted for LM is called the loss measurement scope.  As noted
          above, one factor affecting the LM scope is whether all data packets
          are counted or only those belonging to a particular traffic class.
          Another is whether various "auxiliary" flows associated with a data
          channel are counted, such as packets flowing over the G-ACh.
          Implementations SHOULD make their supported LM scopes clear to the
          user, and care must be taken to ensure that the scopes of the
          channel endpoints agree.

<a name="rfc.section.2.7.9"></a><h3>2.7.9.&nbsp;
Delay Measurement Timestamp Format</h3>

<p>There are two significant timestamp formats in common use: the
          timestamp format of the Internet standard Network Time Protocol
          (NTP), described in <a class='info' href='#RFC5905'>[RFC5905]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mills, D., Martin, J., Burbank, J., and W. Kasch, &ldquo;Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>, and the timestamp
          format used in the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) <a class='info' href='#IEEE1588'>[IEEE1588]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IEEE, &ldquo;1588-2008 IEEE Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization           Protocol for Networked Measurement and Control Systems,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The NTP format has the advantages of wide use and long deployment
          in the Internet, and was specifically designed to make the
          computation of timestamp differences as simple and efficient as
          possible. On the other hand, there is also now a significant
          deployment of equipment designed to support the PTP format.
</p>
<p>The approach taken in this document is therefore to include in DM
          messages fields which identify the timestamp formats used by the two
          devices involved in a DM operation. This implies that a node
          attempting to carry out a DM operation may be faced with the problem
          of computing with and possibly reconciling different timestamp
          formats. Support for multiple timestamp formats is OPTIONAL. An
          implementation SHOULD, however, make clear which timestamp formats
          it supports and the extent of its support for computation with and
          reconciliation of different formats for purposes of delay
          measurement.
</p>
<p>In recognition of the wide deployment, particularly in
          hardware-based timing implementations, of IEEE 1588 PTP, the PTP
          timestamp format is the default format used in DM messages. This
          format MUST be supported.

Message Formats</h3>

<p>Loss Measurement and Delay Measurement messages flow over the MPLS
      Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) <a class='info' href='#RFC5586'>[RFC5586]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bocci, M., Vigoureux, M., and S. Bryant, &ldquo;MPLS Generic Associated Channel,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Thus, a
      packet containing an LM or DM message contains an MPLS label stack, with
      the G-ACh Label (GAL) at the bottom of the stack.  The GAL is followed
      by an Associated Channel Header (ACH) which identifies the message type,
      and the message body follows the ACH.
</p>
<p>This document defines the following ACH Channel Types:
         </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>MPLS Direct Packet Loss Measurement (DLM) <br />

              MPLS Inferred Packet Loss Measurement (ILM) <br />

              MPLS Packet Delay Measurement (DM) <br />

              MPLS Direct Packet Loss and Delay Measurement (DLM+DM) <br />

              MPLS Inferred Packet Loss and Delay Measurement (ILM+DM)
</p>
</blockquote><p>
      
</p>
<p>The message formats for direct and inferred LM are identical, as are
      the formats for the DLM+DM and ILM+DM messages.
</p>
<p>For these channel types, the ACH SHALL NOT be followed by the ACH TLV

</p>
<p>The fixed-format portion of a message MAY be followed by a block of
      Type-Length-Value (TLV) fields.  The TLV block provides an extensible
      way of attaching subsidiary information to LM and DM messages.  Several

        as specified in <a class='info' href='#pf_tsf'>Section&nbsp;3.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Timestamp Field Formats</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Session Identifier: Set arbitrarily in a query and copied in the
        response, if any.
</p>
<p>TC: When the T flag is set to 1, this field is set to the TC being
        measured.  When the T flag is set to 0, the value of this field is
        arbitrary, and the field can be considered part of the Session
        Identifier.
</p>
<p>Origin Timestamp: Timestamp recording the transmit time of the
        query message.
</p>
<p>Counter 1-4: Referring to <a class='info' href='#ov_loss'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Loss Measurement</span><span>)</span></a>, when a query
        is sent from A, Counter 1 is set to A_TxP and the other counter fields
        are set to 0. When the query is received at B, Counter 2 is set to
        B_RxP. At this point, B copies Counter 1 to Counter 3 and Counter 2 to
        Counter 4, and re-initializes Counter 1 and Counter 2 to 0. When B
        transmits the response, Counter 1 is set to B_TxP. When the response
        is received at A, Counter 2 is set to A_RxP.
</p>
<p>The mapping of counter types such as A_TxP to the counter fields
        1-4 is designed to ensure that transmit counter values are always
        written at the same fixed offset in the packet, and likewise for
        receive counters.  This property is important for hardware
        processing.
</p>
<p>All counter values MUST be in network byte order.  When a 32-bit
        counter value is written to one of the counter fields, that value
        SHALL be written to the low-order 32 bits of the field; the high-order
        32 bits of the field MUST, in this case, be set to 0.

Initiating a Loss Measurement Operation</h3>

<p>An LM operation for a particular channel consists of sending a
          sequence (LM[1], LM[2], ...) of LM query messages over the channel
          at a specific rate and processing the responses received, if any. As
          described in <a class='info' href='#ov_loss'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Loss Measurement</span><span>)</span></a>, the packet loss associated
          with the channel during the operation is computed as a delta between
          successive messages; these deltas can be accumulated to obtain a
          running total of the packet loss for the channel.
</p>
<p>The query message transmission rate MUST be sufficiently high,
          given the LM message counter size (which can be either 32 or 64
          bits) and the speed and minimum packet size of the underlying
          channel, that the ambiguity condition noted in <a class='info' href='#ov_loss'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Loss Measurement</span><span>)</span></a> cannot arise.  The implementation SHOULD assume,
          in evaluating this rate, that the counter size is 32 bits unless
          explicitly configured otherwise, or unless (in the case of a
          bidirectional channel) all local and remote interfaces involved
          in the LM operation are known to be 64-bit-capable, which can be
          inferred from the value of the X flag in an LM response.
</p>
<p>When initiating an LM operation, the far end may require a period
          of time to become ready for the requested measurement operation.
          During this period, LM queries MAY simply be discarded, and the
          querier expecting a response SHOULD be prepared for this situation,
          for example by setting a timer to differentiate between an
          acceptable initialization delay and a permanent unavailability
          condition at the far end.  Alternatively, the receiver MAY respond,
          possibly in a rate-limited manner, to queries received during this
          period with an appropriate notification code.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.10"></a><h3>4.1.10.&nbsp;
Message Loss and Packet Misorder Conditions</h3>

<p>Because an LM operation consists of a message sequence with state
          maintained from one message to the next, LM is subject to the
          effects of lost messages and misordered packets in a way that DM is
          not. Because this state exists only on the querier, the handling of
          these conditions is, strictly speaking, a local matter. This
          section, however, presents recommended procedures for handling such
          conditions.
</p>
<p>The first kind of anomaly that may occur is that one or more LM
          messages may be lost in transit. The effect of such loss is that
          when an LM Response is next received at the querier, an unambiguous
          interpretation of the counter values it contains may be impossible,
          for the reasons described at the end of <a class='info' href='#ov_loss'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Loss Measurement</span><span>)</span></a>. Whether this is so depends on the number of messages lost and
          the other variables mentioned in that section, such as the LM
          message rate and the channel parameters.
</p>
<p>Another possibility is that LM messages are misordered in
          transit, so that for instance the response to LM[n] is received
          prior to the response to LM[n-1]. A typical implementation will
          discard the late response to LM[n-1], so that the effect is the same
          as the case of a lost message.
</p>
<p>Finally, LM is subject to the possibility that data packets are
          misordered relative to LM messages. This condition can result, for
          example, in a transmit count of 100 and a corresponding receive
          count of 101. The effect here is that the A_TxLoss[n-1,n] value (for
          example) for a given measurement interval will appear to be
          extremely (if not impossibly) large. The other case, where an LM
          message arrives earlier than some of the packets, simply results in
          those packets being counted as lost, which is usually what is
          desired.
</p>
<p>An implementation SHOULD identify a threshold value that
          indicates the upper bound of lost packets measured in a single
          computation beyond which the interval is considered unmeasurable.
          This is called the MaxLMIntervalLoss threshold.  It is clear that
          this threshold should be no higher than the maximum number of
          packets (or bytes) the channel is capable of transmitting over the
          interval, but it may be lower.  Upon encountering an unmeasurable
          interval, the LM state (i.e. data values from the last LM message
          received) SHOULD be discarded.
</p>
<p>With regard to lost LM messages, the MaxLMInterval (see <a class='info' href='#ov_loss'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Loss Measurement</span><span>)</span></a>) indicates the maximum amount of time that can
          elapse before the LM state is discarded.  If some messages are lost,
          but a message is subsequently received within MaxLMInterval, its
          timestamp or sequence number will quantify the loss, and it MAY
          still be used for measurement, although the measurement interval
          will in this case be longer than usual.
</p>
<p>If an LM message is received that has a timestamp less than or
          equal to the timestamp of the last LM message received, this
          indicates that an exception has occurred, and the current interval
          SHOULD be considered unmeasurable unless the implementation has some
          other way of handling this condition.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2.5"></a><h3>4.2.5.&nbsp;
Timestamp Format Negotiation</h3>

<p>In case either the querier or the responder in a DM transaction
          is capable of supporting multiple timestamp formats, it is desirable
          to determine the optimal format for purposes of delay measurement on
          a particular channel. The procedures for making this
          determination SHALL be as follows.
</p>
<p>Upon sending an initial DM Query over a channel, the querier
          sets the Querier Timestamp Format (QTF) field to its preferred
          timestamp format.
</p>
<p>Upon receiving any DM Query message, the responder determines
          whether it is capable of writing timestamps in the format specified
          by the QTF field. If so, the Responder Timestamp Format (RTF) field
          is set equal to the QTF field. If not, the RTF field is set equal to
          the Responder's Preferred Timestamp Format (RPTF) field.
</p>
<p>The process of changing from one timestamp format to another at
          the responder may result in the Timestamp 1 and Timestamp 4 fields
          in an in-band DM Response having different formats. If this is the
          case, the Control Code in the response MUST NOT be set to 0x1
          (Success). Unless an error condition has occurred, the Control Code
          MUST be set to 0x2 (Notification - Data Format Invalid).
</p>
<p>Upon receiving a DM Response, the querier knows from the RTF
          field in the message whether the responder is capable of supporting
          its preferred timestamp format: if it is, the RTF will be equal to
          the QTF. The querier also knows the responder's preferred timestamp
          format from the RPTF field. The querier can then decide whether to
          retain its current QTF or to change it and repeat the negotiation
          procedures.

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
Congestion Considerations</h3>

<p>An MPLS network may be traffic-engineered in such a way that the
      bandwidth required both for client traffic and for control, management
      and OAM traffic is always available. The following congestion
      considerations therefore apply only when this is not the case.
</p>
<p>The proactive generation of Loss Measurement and Delay Measurement
      messages for purposes of monitoring the performance of an MPLS channel
      naturally results in a degree of additional load placed on both the
      network and the terminal nodes of the channel. When configuring such
      monitoring, operators should be mindful of the overhead involved and
      should choose transmit rates that do not stress network resources
      unduly; such choices must be informed by the deployment context. In case
      of slower links or lower-speed devices, for example, lower Loss
      Measurement message rates can be chosen, up to the limits noted at the
      end of <a class='info' href='#ov_loss'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Loss Measurement</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>In general, lower measurement message rates place less load on the
      network at the expense of reduced granularity. For delay measurement
      this reduced granularity translates to a greater possibility that the
      delay associated with a channel temporarily exceeds the expected
      threshold without detection. For loss measurement, it translates to a
      larger gap in loss information in case of exceptional circumstances such
      as lost LM messages or misordered packets.
</p>
<p>When carrying out a sustained measurement operation such as an LM
      operation or continuous pro-active DM operation, the querier SHOULD take
      note of the number of lost measurement messages (queries for which a
      response is never received) and set a corresponding Measurement Message
      Loss Threshold. If this threshold is exceeded, the measurement operation
      SHOULD be suspended so as not to exacerbate the possible congestion
      condition. This suspension SHOULD be accompanied by an appropriate
      notification to the user so that the condition can be investigated and
      corrected.
</p>
<p>From the receiver perspective, the main consideration is the
      possibility of receiving an excessive quantity of measurement messages.
      An implementation SHOULD employ a mechanism such as rate-limiting to
      guard against the effects of this case. Authentication procedures can
      also be used to ensure that only queries from authorized devices are
      processed.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>There are three main types of security considerations associated with
      the exchange of performance monitoring messages such as those described
      in this document: the possibility of a malicious or misconfigured device
      generating an excessive quantity of messages, causing service
      impairment; the possibility of unauthorized alteration of messages in
      transit; and the possibility of an unauthorized device learning the data
      contained in or implied by such messages.
</p>
<p>The first consideration is discussed in <a class='info' href='#con_con'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Congestion Considerations</span><span>)</span></a>. If
      reception or alteration of performance-related data by unauthorized
      devices is an operational concern, authentication and/or encryption
      procedures should be used to ensure message integrity and
      confidentiality.  Such procedures are outside the scope of this
      document, but have general applicability to OAM protocols in MPLS-TP
      networks.
