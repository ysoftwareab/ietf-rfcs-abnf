Abstract

    The SEARCH=INTHREAD extension extends the IMAP SEARCH command to
    search on entire threads as well as individual messages. Other
    commands which search are implicitly extended.

    The THREAD=REFS extension provides a threading algorithm using only
    the Feferences header field for use with the IMAP THREAD command.

1.  Conventions Used in This Document

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

    Formal syntax is defined by [RFC4234] as extended by [RFC3501] and
    [SORT].

    Example lines prefaced by "C:" are sent by the client and ones
    prefaced by "S:" by the server. The five characters [...] means that
    something has been elided.


2.  Overview

    An IMAP server (see [RFC3501]) that supports this extension MUST
    announce SEARCH=INTHREAD as one of its capabilities. The extension
    adds no new commands and responses. It adds one new search-key,
    INTHREAD.


3.  The INTHREAD Search Key

    INTHREAD takes two arguments, a threading algorithm (as defined in
    [SORT]) and another search key.

    The INTHREAD search-key matches a message if its subsidiary search-
    key matches at least one message in the same thread as the message.

    This command finds all messages in an entire thread concerning the
    meetings where fizzle was discussed:

         C: a UID SEARCH INTHREAD REFS (SUBJECT meeting BODY fizzle)

    This command threads all threads containing at least one message
    from fred@example.com:

         C: a UID THREAD REFS utf-8 INTHREAD REFS FROM
            <fred@example.com>


4.  The THREAD=REFS Thread Algorithm

    The THREAD=REFS thread algorithm is defined as the part of
    THREAD=REFERENCES (see [SORT]) which concerns itself with the
    References and Message-ID header fields. THREAD=REFS ignores Date,
    In-Reply-To and Subject.

    This document defines THREAD=REFS because THREAD=REFERENCES is too
    inclusive for this purpose. For example, independent threads that
    happen to have use same subject field (such as "Agenda for Friday's
    meeting" or "Web site updated") are grouped into one thread by
    THREAD=REFERENCES.

    It is explicitly permitted for the server to persistently store
    threading information, even if this causes the server to return
    different information than it would otherwise. This can happen if
    the first messages in a thread are deleted, for example.

    Open Issue 1: Should THREAD=REFS use In-Reply-To if there is no
    References?

    Open Issue 2: Should INTHREAD be able to use any other threading
    algorithm? It would be much simpler (in my case at least) to
    implement INTHREAD for just one threading algorithm, and INTHREAD
    REFERENCES is computationally expensive.


5.  Formal Syntax

    The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
    Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC4234]. [RFC3501] defines
    the non-terminals "capability" and "search-key" and [SORT] defines
    "thread-alg".

    Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
    insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
    token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
    accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

        capability   =/ "SEARCH=INTHREAD" / "THREAD=REFS"

        search-key   =/ "INTHREAD" SP thread-alg SP search-key


6.  Security Considerations

    This document is believed not to have any security implications.


7.  IANA Considerations

    The IANA is requested to add SEARCH=INTHREAD and THREAD=REFS to the
    list of IMAP extensions,
    http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities.

Open Issues

    Do I want a MESSAGE-ID search-key, which returns the message with a
    given ID? Dave asked for it, but it seems mildly redundant. Can be
    done using 'HEADER "Message-ID" "<asfs23r@asdfasd.fds>".


Changes since -00

    - The IANA asked me to specify the IANA registry exactly

    - Boilerplate updates - IETF Trust and so on.
