   Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Comments
   should be submitted to the dhcp-v4@bucknell.edu mailing list.

Abstract

   This document defines a new DHCP option for delivering configuration
   information to hosts utilizing the Compatibility Mode Driver (CMD)
   provided with Novell∆s NetWare 5. This option is passed from the DHCP 
   server to the DHCP Client to provide the addresses of one or more 
   Migration Agents along with their CMD network number. 

Introduction

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)[1] provides a
   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP
   network. The Compatibility Mode Driver (CMD) provided with NetWare 5 
   facilitates smooth migration of networks from IPX and NetWare/IP, to 
   Pure IP. This component provides the necessary connectivity for IPX 
   Client/Server applications to communicate with nodes that connect to
   the IP internet. It also allows IPX Client/Server applications to run
   on IP Nodes.

   Connectivity between IPX Nodes and IP Nodes is achieved through the 
   use of gateways called Migration Agents.

   This document describes a DHCP option that carries addresses of one 
   or more Migration Agents along with their CMD Network number. The 
   addresses of Migration Agents are required by other Migration Agents
   to discover new IPX Nodes.

Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

   This document also uses the following terms:

      "DHCP client"

           DHCP client or "client" is an Internet host using DHCP to
           obtain configuration parameters such as a network address.

      "DHCP server"

           A DHCP server or "server" is an Internet host that returns
           configuration parameters to DHCP clients.

Migration Agent List Option Format

   The code for this option is TBD. The minimum length specified in the
   ÊLen∆ field is 8 bytes, and this length MUST be a multiple of 8. This 
   option can contain addresses of multiple migration agents along with 
   their CMD Network number. The first four bytes specifies the IP 
   address (in hexadecimal format) of the Migration Agent, and the next 
   four bytes specifies the CMD Network number (in hexadecimal format) 
   of the Migration Agent.

   Code  Len  IP Address          CMD Network Number
  +-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-      
  | TBD | 08 | a1 | a2 | a3 | a4 | n1 | n2 | n3 | n4 |
  +-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-

   In the above example, (0xa1a2a3a4) specifies the IP address of the 
   Migration Agent and (0xn1n2n3n4) specifies the CMD Network number of 
   the Migration Agent.

DHCP Client Behavior

   The DHCP client will use this option to get the IP addresses of all
   the Migration Agents in the CMD network in which the client is
   present.

Security Considerations

   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security mechanisms.
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
   protocol specification [1]. In particular, these DHCP options allow 
   an unauthorized DHCP server to misdirect any client to a non existent 
   Migration Agent.
