providers.


1.  Introduction

     The purpose of this document is to	provide	a checklist for	the gen-
eral  Internet	community  to use when discussing security with	Internet
Service	Providers (ISPs).  These questions can serve as	a framework  for
discussion of security expectations with current and prospective service
providers.  Regrettably, such a	discussion rarely takes	place today.

     This  document  is	 addressed  to	 Internet   service   purchasing
decision-makers	(consumers).  Three types of consumers are considered in
this document:	connectivity consumers,	hosting	service	 consumers,  and
co-located consumers.

     Additionally, in informing	ISPs of	what the community will	be  ask-
ing  of	them, a	further	goal is	to encourage ISPs to become proactive in
making security	not only a priority, but something to which  they  point
with pride when	selling	their services.	 It has	been argued that vendors
begin to care about security only when prompted	by consumers.	We  hope
that these documents will encourage both parties to more readily express
how much they care about security, and that discussion between the  com-
munity and its ISPs will be increased.

     Note that these are broad categories and individual  consumers  may
not  fall exactly into these categories; as such, not all questions will
apply to all consumers,	nor will all questions apply to	all ISPs.

     Companion documents, [RFCisp] and [RFCsshadd], express the	 general
Internet community's expectations of ISPs with respect to security.

     The questions have	been collected together	into Appendix A	for easy
reference.

2.  Concerns Specific to Connectivity Service Consumers

2.1.  Policies


2.1.1.	Security Policy

     **	  Does the ISP have a written Security Policy?

     **	  If so, how can you receive a copy of it?

     A Security	Policy covers such issues  as  privacy,	 authentication,
accountability,	  application  of  security  patches,  availability  and



Hansen							        [Page 2]

Internet Draft	  Security Checklist for ISP Consumers	   June	25, 1999


violations reporting.  A more detailed discussion of  Security	Policies
can be found in	the Site Security Handbook [RFC2196].

2.1.2.	Appropriate Use	Policy

     **	  Does the ISP have a written Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)?

     **	  If so, how can you receive a copy of it?

     When you establish	a contract with	your ISP to provide connectivity
to  the	Internet, most contracts are governed by an Appropriate	Use Pol-
icy (AUP).  An AUP should clearly identify what	you may	and may	 not  do
on  the	 various components of the system or network, including	the type
of traffic allowed on the networks.  The AUP should be	as  explicit  as
possible to avoid ambiguity or misunderstanding.

     The AUP should be reviewed	each time you renew your contract.   You
should	also expect your ISP to	proactively notify you as their	policies
are updated.

2.1.3.	Sanctions

     **	  If there is an AUP, what sanctions will  be  enforced	 in  the
	  event	of inappropriate behaviour?

     An	AUP should be clear in stating what sanctions will  be	enforced
in  the	 event	of inappropriate behaviour.  You should	also expect your
ISP to be forthcoming in announcing to the community when such sanctions
are imposed.

2.1.4.	Announcement of	Policies

     **	  If the AUP changes, will you be notified of changes to it, and
	  if so, how?

     You should	expect your ISP	to publish their security and  appropri-
ate  use  policies  in a public	place such as their web	site.  This way,
the community can be aware of what the ISP considers appropriate and can
know what actions to expect in the event of inappropriate behaviour.

2.2.  Incident Handling

     A Security	Incident Response Team (SIRT) is a team	 that  performs,
coordinates,  and  supports  the  response  to	security  incidents that
involve	sites within a defined constituency.  The  Internet  community's
expectations of	SIRTs are described in [BCP21].





Hansen							        [Page 3]

Internet Draft	  Security Checklist for ISP Consumers	   June	25, 1999


2.2.1.	ISPs and Security Incident Response Teams


     **	  Does the ISP have a Security Incident	Response Team (SIRT)?

	  **   If so,

	       **   What is the	charter, policies and  services	 of  the
		    team?

	       **   What is the	escalation chain that I	would follow?

	       **   Is it published somewhere (on the web)?

	       **   What is the	cost of	using the SIRT's different  ser-
		    vices?

	  **   If not,

	       **   What role will the ISP take	in response to	a  secu-
		    rity incident?

	       **   Is there another SIRT to whom you can turn?

     **	  What other security resources	are available from the ISP?

	  **   If so, at what cost?

     **	  What other security-related services are  available  from  the
	  ISP?

	  **   If so, at what cost?

     Some ISPs have Security Incident  Response	 Teams	(SIRT's).   Some
don't.	In some	ISPs, the SIRT consists	of a single person; in others, a
large group of people.	Some ISP's provide SIRT's as an	added-cost  ser-
vice,  with  the  team	defining  as  their  constituency only those who
specifically subscribe to (and perhaps pay for)	Incident  Response  ser-
vices.

     Some of the services provided by  SIRT's  include:	  responding  to
attacks	 on the	ISP's consumers, responding to attacks on other	sites by
consumers of the ISP, Virtual Private Network (VPN) and	firewall manage-
ment, and intrusion detection.

     Thus it's important to determine what incident response  and  secu-
rity  resources	 are available to you, and define your incident	response
escalation chain BEFORE	an incident occurs.  You should	find out if your



Hansen							        [Page 4]

Internet Draft	  Security Checklist for ISP Consumers	   June	25, 1999


ISP  has  a  SIRT,  and	if so what the charter,	policies and services of
that team are.	(This information is best expressed using the SIRT  tem-
plate as shown in Appendix D of	[BCP21].)

     If	the ISP	doesn't	have a SIRT, you should	find out what  role,  if
any,  they  WILL  take in response to an incident.  You	should also find
out if there is	any other SIRT whose constituency would	include	yourself
and  to	 whom incidents	could be reported.  You	may also be able to con-
tract these services from third-party companies	to  perform  these  ser-
vices on a routine or one-time basis.

2.2.2.	Assistance with	Inbound	Security Incidents


     **	  Will the ISP inform you of attacks against you?

     **	  Will the ISP provide assistance to trace an attack?

     **	  Will the ISP collect and protect evidence of the incident?

     **	  Will the ISP guard against destruction of such evidence?

     **	  Will the ISP guard against unintentional announcement	of  such
	  evidence.

     When a security incident targeting	you occurs,  you  should  expect
your  ISP  to  inform you of the attack, provide assistance to trace the
attack,	collect	and protect evidence of	the incident, and guard	 against
its destruction	or unintentional announcement.

     If	the event continues, you may ask the ISP to provide  logging  in
order  to  further diagnose the	problem, or to perform filtering of cer-
tain types of traffic.

     You should	ask your ISP what information they will	be able	to  give
out  if	another	consumer is the	party attacking	you to determine whether
or not their response is acceptable to you.   Some  providers  may  give
this  information  freely, while others	will not release the identity of
the attacker without a court order.

2.2.3.	Notification of	Vulnerabilities	and Reporting of Incidents

     **	  What information will	the ISP	make available to you  as  secu-
	  rity vulnerabilities are discovered in their services?

     **	  Will they be proactive or reactive in	informing you?

     **	  How and where	will that information be communicated to you?



Hansen							        [Page 5]

Internet Draft	  Security Checklist for ISP Consumers	   June	25, 1999


     **	  What information will	be included in such reports?

     You should	expect your ISP	to be  proactive  in  notifying	 you  of
security  vulnerabilities in the services they provide.	 In addition, as
new vulnerabilities in systems and software are	discovered, they  should
indicate whether their services	are threatened by these	risks.

     When security incidents occur that	affect components  of  an  ISP's
infrastructure,	your ISP should	promptly report	to you:

     -	  who is coordinating response to the incident

     -	  the vulnerability

     -	  how service was affected

     -	  what is being	done to	respond	to the incident

     -	  whether customer data	may have been compromised

     -	  what is being	done to	eliminate the vulnerability

     -	  the  expected	 schedule  for	response,  assuming  it	 can  be
	  predicted

     -	  the trouble ticket number being used to track	the incident  by
	  the  provider,  or  other  suitable  means  of identifying the
	  incident at a	later date.

2.2.4.	Contact	Information

     **	  Who should you contact via email for network security	issues?

     **	  Who should you contact via email to report inappropriate  pub-
	  lic behaviour?

     **	  Who should you contact via email for issues relating	to  net-
	  work infrastructure?

     **	  Who should you contact via email for network security	issues?

     **	  ???? Anything	else from the email list?

     If	you need to contact someone at your  ISP,  you	should	use  the
address	  SECURITY@your.isp.example   for   network   security	 issues,
ABUSE@your.isp.example	for  issues  relating  to  inappropriate  public
behaviour,  and	 NOC@your.isp.example  for  issues  relating  to network
infrastructure.	 ([RFC2142] states that	sites  (including  ISPs)  should



Hansen							        [Page 6]

Internet Draft	  Security Checklist for ISP Consumers	   June	25, 1999


maintain  these	 mailboxes,  as	 well  as  additional mailboxes	that are
defined	for receiving queries and  reports  relating  to  specific  ser-
vices.)	   Your	  ISP	may   also   have   web	 site  addresses  (e.g.,
http://www.your.isp.example/security/) that you	may  use  to  check  for
expanded  details on the above.	 You should also be able to find contact
information for	your ISP in Whois and in the routing registry [RFC1786].

2.2.5.	After Hours

     **	  What are the hours of	operation of customer support or  opera-
	  tions	personnel?

     **	  If reduced support is	available "after hours", how can support
	  personnel be reached in the case of a	security incident?

     You should	recieve	information for	 reaching  customer  support  or
operations  personnel.	 If  the ISP does not maintain 24x7 (24	hours, 7
days per week) operations (NOC,	Customer Support, etc.), then some means
should	still  be  available  for reaching customer support for	security
incidents (suspected or	actual)	and receiving a	response in real-time.

2.2.6.	Communication and Authentication

     **	  How would your ISP communicate with you if a security	incident
	  were to occur?

     **	  What information would be communicated with others?

     You should	expect your ISP	to have	clear policies and procedures on
the  sharing  of  information  about a security	incident with you, other
ISPs or	SIRTs, with law	enforcement, and with the press	and the	 general
public.	  If  your jurisdiction	permits, you should expect to be able to
conduct	such communication with	your ISP over a	 secure	 channel  (e.g.,
secure web, secure Email, telephone, attended fax, etc.).

2.3.  Layer 2 Security

     **	  What measures	do you take to prevent traffic taking  unauthor-
	  ised routes into or via your network?

     **	  Are the networks that	support	your connectivity consumers  and
	  your hosting consumers segmented?

     **	  What general measures	do you take  to	 protect  your	Internet
	  facing  equipment providing production services from denial of
	  service attacks, break-ins or	spoofing?

     Most ISPs have firewalls of one kind or another that prevent random



Hansen							        [Page 7]

Internet Draft	  Security Checklist for ISP Consumers	   June	25, 1999


packets	from flowing through their network from	the Internet.

     Methods of	segmenting networks include VLANs and non-broadcast net-
works.	These can prevent one consumer class from affecting another con-
sumer class.

2.4.  Security Patches

     **	  Is the ISP up-to-date	in applying security  patches  to  their
	  software/firmware running on their production	equipment?

     Information about available security patches is  readily  available
from	the    Center	 for   Emergency   Response   Team   (CERT)   at
http://www.cert.org.  You can use telnet to connect to the port	 numbers
of  public  TCP-based services (SMTP, POP, IMAP, HTTP, etc.) provided by
the ISP, and check the announced version  numbers  for	currentness  and
known security flaws.

2.5.  Other Security Services
For the	really serious consumer, additional services may be useful.

     **	  Are port scan	audits ever performed on consumer's networks and
	  abnormal findings reported to	the consumer?

     **	  If so, how much does it cost?

     **	  Is additional	support	available for auditing and securing your
	  hosts?

     **	  If so, how much does it cost?

     **	  Does the ISP	have  a	 monitoring  system  that  detects  host
	  attacks or network attacks in	realtime?

     **	  Would	it be possible to test the ISP's security by mounting  a
	  deliberate attack at a mutually agreed time?

     Audits run	by the ISP provide tests of your  own  host's  security.
These can be useful for	plugging holes on your systems.

     Probes of the ISP's network can potentially be seen by them  as  an
attack,	 and  may lead to ramifications	against	you.  So be careful that
you do any testing of the ISP's	 security  only	 with  their  knowledge.
Freely	available  tools,  such	 as  ping,  traceroute,	SATAN and mscan,
attempt	a variety of probes.  Most ISP's monitoring systems will pick up
such   probes.	  Useful  tools	 of  this  sort	 can  be  obtained  from
ftp://ftp.cert.org.




Hansen							        [Page 8]

Internet Draft	  Security Checklist for ISP Consumers	   June	25, 1999


2.6.  References

     **	  Will the ISP provide a list of reference customers?

     If	the ISP	lets you speak with some reference customers, you  might
ask  them  about problems with respect to the reporting	or resolution of
any security incidents,	as well	as  the	 security  services  and  advice
offered	to them	by the ISP.

3.  Concerns Specific to Hosting Service Consumers

     If	you are	hosting	content	on your	ISP, you  have	additional  con-
cerns.

3.1.  Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

     **	  What is the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for web content hosted
	  by the ISP?

     Generally there is	a separate AUP from that used  for  connectivity
consumers.

3.2.  Physical Security

     **	  What is the physical security	of the machines	used  for  host-
	  ing?

     Machines used for hosting may be housed in	unlocked  cabinets.   As
such, there must be tight restrictions as to who may have access.  Elec-
tronic access control, guards, video surveillance, etc.,  are  all  fair
game.  All visitors ESPECIALLY need to be escorted, as the potential for
damage is much higher than in a	colocation situation.

     As	the consumer is	 not  generally	 responsible  for  securing  the
operating  system or applications, there needs to be a heightened under-
standing of how	the ISP	reacts.

     If	you also get connectivity from the ISP (i.e., a	T1), you  should
check  to  see	if  security for the managed site is done by a different
group and check	to see if the procedures for reporting and  notification
are much different.

     Providers should do a good	deal of	proactive testing  against,  and
active patching	of the OS and application loads.  As these loads tend to
be the same from consumer to consumer, the ISP should be responsible  in
assuring host based security.





Hansen							        [Page 9]

Internet Draft	  Security Checklist for ISP Consumers	   June	25, 1999


3.3.  Backups

     **	  How often are	backups	of your	web content performed?

     **	  How often are	off-site backup	services used?

     Since the ISP is doing backups of	your  material,	 you  should  be
aware  of  their frequency.  Most providers also periodically send their
backups	to off-site locations.	You may	wish to	provide	additional back-
ups of your own	for the	content.

3.4.  Allocation of Network Capacity

     **	  Does the ISP provide any sort	of  load  balancing  to	 prevent
	  saturation  of  the network capacity by other	customers of the
	  ISP?

     Other customers may legitimately cause a denial of	 service  attack
by hogging all of the network capacity.	 Providers should have standards
as far as how saturated	their networks may get,	and should prevent  this
from occurring.

3.5.  Spare Facilities

     **	  What kind of spare facilities	are available for use should  an
	  incident occur?

     **	  How fast can they be deployed?

     This information is useful	if high	 availability  is  important  to
you.   Cold site facilities and	hot spare hardware can be important when
recovering from	an incident.

3.6.  Managed Security Services

     **	  Does the ISP provide a managed security service?
     Many providers offer a  managed  security	service	 for  additional
     fees.  Consumers are encouraged to	find out what is included in the
     service that they are paying for, and to explore options as far  as
     what they can do.

3.7.  Content Management

     **	  What kind of access is provided to the  machine  for	managing
	  your content?

     **	  What kind of content is permitted to be hosted?




Hansen						               [Page 10]

Internet Draft	  Security Checklist for ISP Consumers	   June	25, 1999


     Modifying the content of your site	can be performed in a  multitude
of  ways.   Some ISP's allow the content to be managed through web pages
only.  Some ISP's allow	you to use FTP to send new content to the  site.
Some  ISP's  provide support for vendor-specific access	(e.g., Microsoft
FrontPage) support.  Some ISP's	provide	a shell	account	for you	 to  log
in and modify the content accordingly.	Some ISP's provide staging areas
for you	to test	new content before publishing it  in  the  normal  loca-
tions.	Some ISP's provide complete access to the machine being	used for
hosting	the content, including administrative control (root  access)  of
the machine.

     Some ISP's	permit only web	pages to be stored.  Some ISP's	 provide
some  canned  CGI  programs  to	be used.  Some ISP's provide support for
streaming audio	or video.  Some	ISP's allow reviewed CGI programs to  be
stored.	  Some	ISP's  allow you to write and use your own CGI programs.
Some ISP's provide access to  other  vendor-specific  server  facilities
(e.g., Fast CGI, Server	Side Scripting).

3.8.  Secure Web Servers

     **	  Does the ISP provide secure web servers (https)?

     **	  If so, is their host certificate issued by a well-known Certi-
	  ficate Authority (CA)?

     **	  Is the  content  provided  by	 the  secure  web  servers  well
	  separated from that available	on their non-secure web	server?

     **	  Is the content provided by the secure	web servers inaccessible
	  by other customers?

     **	  How would you	upload content to the secure web servers?

     Secure web	servers	provide	an additional layer of security	 to  the
content.   Such	 content  must not be accessible from the non-secure web
servers, nor should be accessible by other  customers.	 The  mechanisms
used  to  upload  content to the secure	web server area	may be different
from those used	to upload content to the non-secure area.

4.  Concerns Specific to Co-location Consumers

     If	you have co-located equipment at your ISP's facility, the physi-
cal  security of the installation should be given appropriate considera-
tion.  This is particularly so for co-located facilities to which people
from  different	 organisations and with	different security policies have
access.	 Many issues arise surrounding	consumer  access  to  their  co-
located	equipment.




Hansen						               [Page 11]

Internet Draft	  Security Checklist for ISP Consumers	   June	25, 1999


4.1.  Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

     **	  What is the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for co-located  consu-
	  mers?

     The AUP for co-located consumers is  usually  different  from  that
used by	connectivity consumers.

4.2.  Physical Security

     **	  What forms of	physical security are provided for  your  equip-
	  ment?

     **	  What forms of	supervision are	 provided  while  visiting  your
	  equipment?

     Ideally you and each other	consumer should	have  a	 fully	enclosed
locking	 'cage',  akin	to  a small room with walls and	ceiling	of heavy
wire mesh fencing, containing the racks	 in  which  their  equipment  is
mounted.   Each	consumer would be allowed access to their own cage under
escort by one of the ISP's employees, by a guard,  with	 keys  or  elec-
tronic	access	control	that grant access specifically to their	cage, or
some combination thereof.

     This assignment of	separate cages is expensive in	terms  of  space
however,  so  many  ISPs  compromise by	putting	all co-located equipment
together in a single machine room, and managing	the actions of	escorted
consumers  very	 closely.   However  this may be insufficient to prevent
mishaps	such as	 the  accidental  disconnection	 of  another  consumer's
equipment.  If a single	machine	room is	used then the ISP should provide
separate locking cabinets for each co-location consumer	in preferance to
an  open  common  area.	  Another  alternative	are  cabinets  which can
separate all of	 the  facilities  within  the  same  cabinet,  and  have
independent locking mechanisms for each	portion	of the rack.

     You should	expect to always be supervised	while  in  the	physical
presence of any	equipment that is not yours, and should	not expect to be
allowed	to touch, photograph, or examine equipment belonging to	 another
consumer.

4.3.  Layer 1 Security

     **	  How is co-located equipment protected	electrically from  other
	  consumer's co-located	equipment?

     Also of importance	is "layer 1" security of  co-located  equipment.
Other  consumers should	not blow the same fuse that you	are on by power-
ing all	their machines up at once.  The	ISP can	control	this  by  having



Hansen						               [Page 12]

Internet Draft	  Security Checklist for ISP Consumers	   June	25, 1999


separate breakers and circuits for each	consumer, or by	overbuilding the
power system and keeping track of the power ratings of all equipment  in
use.

4.4.  Layer 2 Security

     **	  How is co-located equipment  protected  on  the  network  from
	  other	consumer's co-located equipment?

     Also of concern is	layer 2	security of co-located equipment.   Your
equipment should not be	allowed	to share a physical network segment with
hosts belonging	to anyone else,	whether	 another  consumer  or	the  ISP
themselves.   It's common for crackers to exploit weak security	or unen-
crypted	remote logins on co-located  consumer-owned  equipment	to  take
control	 of that equipment and put it into promiscuous listening mode on
the local network segment, thereby potentially compromising the	 privacy
and  security of any other devices on that segment.  The use of	a switch
is generally recommended for this sort of thing.
