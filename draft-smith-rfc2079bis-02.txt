2.  Abstract

   Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) are widely used to specify the
   location of Internet resources.  This document defines an attribute

INTERNET-DRAFT    URI Attribute Type and Object Class   22 February 2002


   type and an auxiliary object class to allow URIs, including URLs, to
   be stored in LDAP and X.500 directory entries in a standard way.

   This document replaces RFC 2079.  See Appendix A for a list of
   changes relative to RFC 2079.



3.  Background and Intended Usage

   Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) as defined by [RFC2396] are
   widely used on the Internet, most notably within Hypertext Markup
   Language [RFC2854] documents. This document defines an attribute type
   called labeledURI and an auxiliary object class called labeledURIOb-
   ject to hold all types of URIs, including URLs.  These definitions
   are designed for use in LDAP[RFC2251] and X.500[X500] directories,
   and may be used in other contexts as well.

   The attribute type and object class definitions in this document are
   written using the BNF form of AttributeTypeDescription and
   ObjectClassDescription given in [RFC2252].  Lines have been folded
   for readability.


4.  Schema Definition of the labeledURI Attribute Type

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.250.1.57
         NAME 'labeledURI'
         EQUALITY caseExactMatch
         SUBSTR caseExactSubstringsMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )



5.  Discussion of the labeledURI Attribute Type

   The labeledURI attribute type has DirectoryString syntax, uses
   caseExact matching rules (since URIs are case-sensitive) and it is
   multivalued.  Values placed in the attribute should consist of a URI
   (typically, a URL) optionally followed by one or more ASCII space
   characters (code U+00020 in ISO/IEC 10646-1[ISO-10646]) and a label.
   Since ASCII space characters are not allowed to appear in URIs, there
   is no ambiguity about where the label begins.  The URI portion must
   comply with the URI syntax specification [RFC2396].  Multiple
   labeledURI values will generally indicate different resources that
   are all related to the directory entry, but may indicate different
   locations for the same resource.

INTERNET-DRAFT    URI Attribute Type and Object Class   22 February 2002


   The label is used to describe the resource to which the URI points,
   and is intended as a friendly name fit for human consumption.  This
   document does not propose any specific syntax for the label part.  In
   some cases it may be helpful to include in the label some indication
   of the kind and/or size of the resource referenced by the URI.

   Note that the EQUALITY matching rule matches against the entire
   value, so labeledURI attribute values that differ only in label are
   not equivalent.  For example, the asserted value:

     ftp://ftp.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt

   does not match the attribute value:

     ftp://ftp.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt LDAPv3 Protocol RFC


   Also, the label is not restricted by the rules that govern the syntax
   of URIs; in particular, any character supported by the Directory-
   String syntax can be used in the label portion of the value.  HTML
   conventions should not be used to represent non-ASCII characters in
   the label portion of a labeledURI value, e.g., the ISO 10646-1 LATIN
   CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+000C5) character should be
   represented using the UTF-8 encoding of the character (the octet
   sequence C3 85) and not the HTML escape sequence "&aring".


6.  Examples of labeledURI Attribute Values

   An example of a labeledURI attribute value that does not include a
   label:

     ftp://ftp.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt


   An example of a labeledURI attribute value that contains a tilde
   character in the URL (special characters in a URL must be encoded as
   specified by the URI document [RFC2396]).  The label is "UMich LDAP
   Home Page":

     http://www.umich.edu/%7Edirsvcs/ldap/ UMich LDAP Home Page


   Another example.  This one includes a hint in the label to help the
   user realize that the URL points to a photo image.

7.  Schema Definition of the labeledURIObject Object Class

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.250.3.15
         NAME 'labeledURIObject'
         DESC 'object that contains the URI attribute type'
         SUP top AUXILIARY MAY labeledURI )



8.  Discussion of the labeledURIObject Object Class

   The labeledURIObject class is a subclass of top and may contain the
   labeledURI attribute.  The intent is that this object class can be
   added to existing directory objects to allow for inclusion of URI
   values.  This approach does not preclude including the labeledURI
   attribute type directly in other object classes as appropriate.



9.  Security Considerations

   Blindly inserting the label portion of a labeledURI attribute value
   into an HTML document is not recommended, as this may allow a mali-
   cious individual to include HTML tags in the label that mislead
   viewers of the entire document in which the labeledURI value was
   inserted.
