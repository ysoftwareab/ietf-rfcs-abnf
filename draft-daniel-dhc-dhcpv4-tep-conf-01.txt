  Abstract 
      
     The intent of this draft is to provide a solution to automate tunnel      
     end-point configuration for a configured IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel. This      
     uses a DHCPv4 option to percolate the tunnel end-point configuration      
     information. This is very useful to connect a newly deployed native      
     IPv6 cloud to other existing IPv6 networks using IPv4 backbone as 
     well as to connect isolated dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 nodes to IPv6 
     networks through IPv4.

  1. Introduction 
      
     In the initial deployment of IPv6, the IPv6 nodes may need to      
     communicate with the other IPv6 nodes via IPv4 networks.  Configured      
     tunnels [5] provide a way to encapsulate the IPv6 packets in IPv4      
     packets and tunnel them in the IPv4 network. 
      
     Configured Tunnel [4] is a simple transition mechanism which allows      
     isolated IPv6 networks or hosts, attached to a legacy IPv4 network      
     which has no native IPv6 connectivity, to communicate with other 
     such IPv6 networks or hosts without manual configuration. 
      
     To configure IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel between isolated IPv6 networks, 
     administrator typically configure available tunnels by hand.  That 
     is, imagine that we want to connect 10 sites together from our 
     border router using full-mesh configured tunneling.  We will have to 
     set up 9 tunnels in each site, 9*10 tunnels in total.  Thus we need 
     a solution to automate the process of building configured tunnels at 
     border routers connected through IPv4 backbone. 
      
     This introduces new DHCPv4 options to distribute the configuration 
     tunnel information automatically.

  2. Common IPv6 deployment Scenarios 
      
     Here is the diagram to explain the automation process in one of the     
     typical transition scenario.

        Legend: 
           TS1      - Dual-stack Tunnel server acting as a border router  
                      with DHCPv4 server. 
           TS2      - Dual-stack Tunnel server acting as a border router  
                      with DHCPv4 client. 
           Tn       - Configured Tunnel 
           CLOUD n  - IPv6 clouds. 
      
      
     In the above scenario if one or more IPv6 network wants to attach,      
     the number of manual tunnel configurations needed is 4. In more      
     general sense if there are "n" existing border routers and an      
     "n+1"th border router is to be added, the number of manual tunnel      
     configurations required is 2n. With this approach, each site's      
     administrator has to be informed whenever a new IPv6 network wishes      
     to get connected. 
      
     The suggested approach in this document will automate the process of 
     configuring the tunnels in all of the border routers.

  3. Terminology 
      
     This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv4 as      
     defined in "Terminology" section of the DHCPv4 specification [1].  
      
      
  4. Automated Configured Tunnel Establishment 
      
     This section describes two options for configuring available tunnel 
     end-points automatically among the border routers enabled DHCP 
     functions. 
      
      
  4.1 Configured Tunnel End Point Reply Option  
      
     - Option definition: 
     The Configured Tunnel End Point Option gives the information to the      
     clients about the Configured Tunnel End Point [5] to be contacted      
     for reaching the nodes in the various IPv6 networks which are      
     separated by IPv4 networks.  The clients are expected to install      
     these routes in their machines. 
      
     The format of the Configured Tunnel End Point Option is as shown      
     below:  
      
     0                   1                   2                   3

     |                                                               |  
     |                 Destination Prefix (16 bytes)                 |  
     |                                                               |  
     |                                                               |

        option-code: OPTION_CTEP_REP (TBD) 
           
        option-len: Total length of the option. It MUST be set to 28. 
      
        prefix-len: prefix length of the Destination Prefix. 
      
        lifetime: The lifetime validity for this tunnel endpoint in

        seconds.  A value 0xFFFFFFFF means infinite lifetime. 
      
        Destination Prefix: An unicast IPv6 Prefix. 
      
        Configured TEP Address: IPv4 Address of the Configured TEP.  This  
        can be any valid unicast IPv4 address.  
      
      
     The clients are expected to install/refresh the tunnel and 
     associated routes identified by the tuple <Destination 
     Prefix/prefix-len, Configured TEP Address> once they receive this 
     option from the server, only if lifetime is non-zero. 
      
     Lifetime zero means that the clients are expected to delete the 
     routes identified by the tuple <Destination Prefix/prefix-len, 
     Configured TEP Address>. 
      
      
      
     - Appearance of this option: 
     The Configured Tunnel End Point Reply Option MUST NOT appear in any 
     message other than the DHCPREPLY message in correspond to the 
     Configured Tunnel End Point Request Option with DHCPREQUEST message. 
      
     This option MAY appear multiple times in DHCPREPLY message.

  4.2 Configured Tunnel End Point Request Option  
      
     - Option definition: 
     The Configured Tunnel End Point Request Option is used by clients to 
     request the DHCPv4 server for obtaining Configured Tunnel end point 
     Information. 
       
     The format of the Configured Tunnel End Point Request Option is as 
     shown below:  
      
     0                   1                   2                   3

  5.1 Sequence for attaching IPv6 cloud 3 
      
     - Assumptions: 
     For configuring available tunnel information, TS3 should search for 
     what TS performs this operation, thus TS sends a DHCPDISCOVER 
     message including Parameter Request List option (Option codes is 
     TBD).  TSes not equipped to interpret this option sent by a TS3 MUST 
     ignore it (although it may be reported).  TSes can interpret this 
     option send DHCPOFFER message with reserved CTEP information into 
     the CTEP_REP option (or multiple options).  There is no preference 
     but TS3 can select one of the TS among them following the longest 
     options as higher preference. 
      
     - Sequence of operation: 
     1. TS3 sends a DHCPREQUEST message with CTEP Request option 
     including its own IPv4 address and allocated IPv6 prefix to DHCPv4 
     server TS1.  If TS1 does not support CTEP Request option since it is 
     not used for tunnel end-point, it sends a DHCPNAK message.

  Internet Draft              CTEP Automate Conf.              July 2004 
   
   
      
     2. TS1 sends a DHCPACK message with CTEP Reply option to TS3 
     including available configured tunnel end-points list. 
      
     3. TS1 establishes configured tunnel with the TS3 using the IPv6 and 
     IPv4 addresses assigned into CTEP Request option from TS3. 
      
     4. TS3 establishes configured tunnel with the TS1 using the IPv6 and 
     IPv4 addresses in CTEP Reply option received from TS1. 
      
     5. TS3 repeats the sequence in step 1 through 4 for all DHCP servers 
     (TSs) which had sent DHCPOFFER message to TS3.  However this step

  5.2 Advantages in this approach 
      
     (a) Whenever a new border router belonging to an IPv6 cloud attaches 
     itself to an existing IPv4 mesh network backbone, the manual effort 
     required to establish configured tunnels between the existing border 
     routers and the new one is drastically reduced.  One typical example 
     of such a mesh network is a company with IPv6 networks at 
     geographically different branches/offices and connected to each 
     other through IPv4 backbone 
      
     (b) Unlike in other automatic tunnels (6to4) where IPv6 addresses 
     are global, this approach imposes no such limitations on the use 
     IPv6 addresses for the nodes in different IPv6 clouds. 
      
      
  6. Security Considerations 
      
     The Configured Tunnel End Point Request/Reply Options may be used by 
     an intruder DHCPv4 server to provide invalid or incorrect configured 
     tunnel end point.  This makes the client unable to reach its 
     destination IPv6 node or to reach incorrect destination.  The latter 
     one has very severe security issues as IPv6 destination is spoofed 
     here.  
      
     To avoid attacks through this option, the DHCPv4 client SHOULD use      
     authenticated DHCP (see Authentication of DHCPv4 messages 
     specifications [7]). 
      
      
  7. IANA Considerations 
      
     IANA is requested to assign an option code to the following options 
     from the option-code space defined in Definition of New DHCPv4 
     options [3].  
      
           Option Name          Value            Described in 
           OPTION_CTEP_REP       TBD             Section 4 
           OPTION_CTEP_REQ       TBD             Section 4
