Abstract 
    
   In this draft context, things are powered by micro controllers units 
   (MCU) comprising a set of memories such as static RAM (SRAM), FLASH 
   and EEPROM. The total memory size, ranges from 10KB to a few 
   megabytes. In this context code and data integrity are major 
   security issues, for the deployment of Internet of Things 
   infrastructure. The goal of the bijective MAC (bMAC) is to compute 
   an integrity value, which cannot be guessed by malicious software. 
   In classical keyed MACs, MAC is computing according to a fixed 
   order. 
   In the bijective MAC, the content of N addresses is hashed according 
   to a permutation P (i.e. bijective application). 
   The bijective MAC key is the permutation P. 
   The number of permutations for N addresses is N!. So the computation 
   of the bMAC requires the knowledge of the whole space memory; this 
   is trivial for genuine software, but could very difficult for 
   corrupted software, especially for time stamped bMAC.

                  Bijective MAC for Constraint Nodes    December 2019 
 
1 Overview 
    
   In this draft context, things are powered by micro controllers units 
   (MCU) comprising a set of memories such as static RAM (SRAM), FLASH 
   and EEPROM. The total memory size ranges from 10KB to a few 
   megabytes. 
   In this context code and data integrity is a major security issue 
   for the deployment of Internet of Things infrastructure. 
   The goal of the bijective MAC (bMAC) is to compute an integrity 
   value, which cannot be guessed by malicious software. 
   In classical keyed MACs, MAC is computing according to a fixed 
   order. 
   In the bijective MAC, the content of N addresses (A[0]...A[N-1]) is 
   hashed according to a hash function H and a permutation P (i.e. 
   bijective application in [0,N-1])so that : 
    
   bMAC(A, P) = H( A[P(0)] || A[P(1)] ... || A[P(N-1)] ) 
    
   The bijective MAC key is the permutation P. The number of 
   permutations for N addresses is N!, as an illustration 35! is 
   greater than 2**128. So the bMAC computation requires the knowledge 
   of the whole space memory. This is trivial for genuine software, but 
   could very difficult for corrupted software, especially for time 
   stamped bMAC. 
    
2 Bijective MAC 
    
2.1 Memory space 
    
   The memory space is represented by an application A, working with N 
   addresses, whose content is a byte value. 
    
                       | [0,N-1] -> [0,255] 
                     A |  
                       | x       -> A[x] 
    
   Non volatile memories (FLASH, EEPROM) MUST be included in the memory 
   space. A subset of SRAM is included in the memory, whose structure 
   relies on operational constraints (heap size, stack size,...). 
    
2.2 Permutation 
    
   For practical reasons, permutation MAY use a range of M values, 
   greater than the size N of the memory space (M>=N). 
    
                       | [0,M-1] -> [0,M-1] 
                     P |  
                       | x       -> P(x)

   For example, given a N memory space, and q a prime number so that 
   q>N, and g a generator for the group Z/qZ, the P permutation (with 
   M= q-1) can computed as: 
    
    
                        | [0,q-2] -> [0,q-2] 
                      P |  
                        | x       -> (g**(1+x) mod q)-1  
    
2.3 bMAC computation 
    
   We consider a one way hash function H (such as SHA2 or SHA3) with 
   three procedures, H.reset, H.update, and H.final. 
    
   Given a space memory N, a permutation P with M values, the bMAC, 
   according to C like notation, is computed as: 
    
   H.reset() ; 
   for (i=0; i< M; i++) 
   { if (P(i) < N)  
          H.update(A[P[i]); 
   } 
   bMAC= H.final(); 
    
2.4 Unused memory 
    
   Unused memory MAY be filled by pseudo random values, before 
   performing the bMAC computation. 
    
    
2.5 Permutation entropy 
    
   A family of Pk permutations is a subset of M! permutations of M 
   elements, which is computed according to dedicated algorithms. 
    
   We note #Pk the number of elements of a Pk family. 
    
   The entropy is the integer e, such as 2**e is closed to #Pk: 
    
   2**e <= #Pk < 2**(e+1) 
    
   The entropy of a family may be increased by the composition of Pk 
   functions so that : 
    
   P(k1,k2,...,kn) = Pkn o ... o Pk2 o Pk1

2.6 Time-stamped bMAC 
    
  2.6.1 Rational 
    
   The main idea is to detect corrupted software that uses a code 
   compression algorithm.

    |          bMAC           |    |             MALWARE           | 
    +-------------------------+    +-------------------------------+ 
    
   The basic principle of the time stamped bMAC is that the code 
   compression algorithm modifies the time needed for the bMAC 
   computing. 
   We assume that the time required by the bMAC computing is dependent 
   on the permutation. 
    
  2.6.2 Canonical time 
    
   We assume that the bMAC computing time (T) ranges between the values 
   Tmin and Tmax (Tmin#Tmax): 
    
   Tmin <= T <= Tmax, Tmin#Tmax 
    
   We define the following values:  
   Range = Tmax-Tmin+1 
   Delta = Tmin modulo Range 
    
   For a given computing time T, we define the canonical computing time 
   cT as: 
   cT = (T-Delta)/Range 
    
   For every T value, cT has a fix value equal to the quotient of 
   Tmin/Range. 
    
   The main interest of the canonical time is that it could work as a 
   secret value, deduced from the bMAC computing but not stored in the 
   software memory image. 
    
   The time-stamped bMAC is computed from an exor operation between the 
   bMAC and the canonical time: 
    
   Time-stamped bMAC = bMAC exor cT

3. The Pq permutation family 
    
   We consider a N memory space, and q a prime number so that q>N. 
    
   Z/qZ is a monogenous group with n=phi(q-1) generators (g), phi being 
   the Euler number. Generators (g) in Z/qZ can be used to build a 
   permutation family Pq= = {Pg1, Pg2,.., Pgn}, so that: 
    
                         | [1,q-1] -> [1,q-1] 
                   Pg(x) |  
                         | x       -> g**x  mod q 
    
   Given a P permutation working in the [1,q-1] range (such as Pg), we 
   use the P*(P) permutation in order to enforce compatibility with the 
   memory space A(x) starting at the zero address : 
    
                         | [0,q-2] -> [0,q-2] 
                      P* |  
                         | x       -> P*(x) = P(1+x)-1 
    
3.1 How to find a generator 
    
  3.1.1 Method 1 
    
   Given x in [2, q-1], 
   If x**k mod q # 1 for all k in [1, q-2], then g is a generator. 
    
  3.1.2 Method 2 
    
   Factorize q-1 into primes: q-1 = q1**k1...qi**ki...qn**kn 
   Find n integers ai (a1...an) of order qi**ki, in Z/qZ (phi(qi**ki) 
   elements) 
   The product of the n elements a1 x...x an, is a generator. 
    
  3.1.3 Method 3 
    
   q being a safe prime, q = 2*p+1 with p prime (p is the Sophie 
   Germain prime),and q = 7 mod 8. 
    
   phi(q-1) = phi(2p) = p-1 
   1 generator of order 2, i.e. p-1 
   p-1 generators of order p-1, i.e. 2**k with k in [1,p-1] 
   p-1 generators gk of order q-1. 
   The generators gk are the product of (p-1).2**k mod q, for k in 
   [1,p-1]. In other words the generators gk are equal to q-2**k mod q, 
   for k in [1,p-1]

3.2 How to compute generators 
    
   Find a generator g. 
    
   There are phi(q-1) generators g**k, with k prime with q-1. 
    
   GCD(k,q-1)=1, GCD being the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers.

   10= 2x5, phi(2)=1, phi(5)=4

         9 4 3 5 1 
         10 1 
    
   10 has an order 2 
   3, 4, 5, 9 have order 5 
   10*3= 8, 4*10= 7, 5*10=6, 9*10=2 are generators 
    
   2 is a generator 
   2**3 = 8 is a generator 
   2**7 = 7 is a generator

   power of 2 mod 23 = {2**k, k in [1,10]}= {2,4,8,16,9,18,13,3,6,12} 
   10 generators gk of order 22 = {21,19,15,7,14,5,10,20,17,11}

3.3 Shifted permutation 
    
   Given an integer s in the range [0, q-1], the shifted permutation 
   P(g,s) is defined as 
    
                        | [1,q-1] -> [1,q-1] 
              P(g,s)(x) |  
                        | x       -> s.g**x mod q 
    
   In other words P(g,s)(x) = s x Pg(x). 
    
   Because s can be written in the form s = g**d, s.g = g**(x+d), which 
   leads to a right shift. 
    
   The number of shifted permutations is (q-1)*phi(q-1). 
    
   The benefit of shifted permutation is to increase, with a low cost 
   computation, the bMAC entropy. 
    
3.4 Composition in Fq 
    
   Given a set of k ptuples {(g1,s1), (g2,s2),..., (gk,sk)} and 
   associated shifted permutations P(gi,si), a permutation P(q,k) is 
   computed according to the relation : 
    
   P(q,k) = P(gk,sk) o ... o P(g2,s2) o P(g1,s1)

3.5 Code example 
    
   The bMAC is computed with a permutation P= P(g2) o P(g1,s1) 
   The pseudo code is written in a C like way. 
   H is a SHA3-256 KECCAK hash function. 
    
  3.5.1 Example 1 
    
   In this example 32 bits integers are used. 
   The prime number q is 9733. 
   The address space is N= 9664. 
   For a 8 bits processor, 12MHz clock, the bMAC is computed in about 
   10s, i.e. 1ms per byte. 
    
    
   uint32-t x,y,bitn,v,gi[14]; 
   uint32-t PRIME, g1=a-generator, s1=a-value, g2=a-generator; 
   bool tohash; 
    
     PRIME =9733; 
     H.reset();   
      
     gi[0]= g2; 
     for (int n=1;n<=13;n++) 
     gi[n] = (gi[n-1] * gi[n-1]) % PRIME; 
      
     x= s1; 
    
     for(int i=1;i<PRIME;i++)

  3.5.2 Example 2 
    
   In this example 64 bits and 32 bits integers are used. 
   The prime number q is 278543. 
   The address space is N= 271360. 
   For a 8 bits processor, 16MHz clock, the bMAC is computed in about 
   320s, i.e. 1.1 ms per byte. 
    
    
   uint32-t bitn,v; 
   uint64-t x,y,gi[19]; 
   uint32-t PRIME, g1=a-generator, s1=a-value, g2=a-generator; 
   bool tohash; 
    
     PRIME = 278543; 
     H.reset(); 
    
     gi[0]=(uint64-t)g2; 
     for (n=1;n<=18;n++) 
     { gi[n] =  gi[n-1] * gi[n-1]; 
       gi[n] =  gi[n] % PRIME; 
     } 
      
     x= s1;  
    
     for(i=1;i<PRIME;i++) 
     { tohash=false; 
       x = x * (uint64-t)g1 ; 
       x=  x  % PRIME ;  
       bitn= (uint32-t) x; 
       y=    (uint64-t) 1; 
      
       for (n=1;n<=19;n++) 
       { if ( (bitn & 0x1) == 0x1)   
         { y = y * gi[n-1] ; 
           y = y % PRIME; 
         } 
         bitn = bitn >>1; 
       } 
      
       v = (uint32-t)(y-1); 
       // if address v exists, read the v address content A(v) 
       // tohash=true ; 
       if (tohash) H.update(A(v)); 
     } 
    
     H.final();

4 bMAC protocol 
    
   A bMAC protocol involves a bMAC requester and a bMAC provider. 
    
   The requester sends to the bMAC provider the parameters needed for 
   the P permutation. 
    
   The bMAC provider computes the bMAC according to the P permutation 
   and returns the result. 
    
   If the bMAC provider has access to internet, the requester 
   (typically a gateway) SHOULD control its internet access in order to 
   avoid side channel attack.
