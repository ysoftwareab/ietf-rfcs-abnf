                End Point Properties for Peer Selection
                     draft-deng-alto-p2p-ext-00.txt

Abstract

   The initial purpose for ALTO protocol is to provide better than
   random peer selection for p2p networks.  The peer selection method
   does not only depend on the peer location, but also on other
   properties of a peering node.  In this document, we define the
   possible ALTO endpoint property extensions that will impact peer
   selection.

1.  Introduction

   The initial purpose for ALTO protocol is to provide better than
   random peer selection for p2p networks.  The peer selection method
   does not only depend on the peer location, but also on other
   properties of a peering node.  In this document, we define the
   possible ALTO endpoint property extensions that will impact peer
   selection.

2.  Terminology

   ALTO: application layer traffic optimization.  For ALTO protocol,
   please refer to [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].

   DSL: Digital subscriber line, is a family of technologies that
   provide Internet access by transmitting digital data over the wires
   of a local telephone network.

   FTTB: Fiber To The Building, refers to fiber reaches the boundary of
   the building.

   FTTH: Fiber To The Home, refers to figure reaches the the boundary of
   the living space.

3.  End Point Extensions

   This document provides three endpoint property extensions for ALTO
   protocol.

3.1.  Endpoint Property Type: p2p_caching

   As described in [I-D.draft-deng-alto-p2pcache], P2P caching node can
   also act as p2p peers in a p2p network.  If a p2p caching peer is
   located near the edge of the network, it will reduce the backbone
   traffic, as well as the uploading traffic.  For example, [RFC7069]
   provides one example of such caching nodes.  P2P caching peers
   usually have higher priority than the ordinary peers for serving a
   content request so as to optimize the network traffic.  So it's
   necessary for the endpoint property to support this indication.

   The value for this property is either "true" or "false", in ASCII.
   If the peer in question is actually a caching node, the value of this
   property wrt the peer is set to "true".

3.2.  Endpoint Property Type: battery_limited

   Another important endpoint property that will impact peer selection
   is what kind of power supply the peer has.  It can be either the
   electric power or the battery supply.  And most of the time, it is
   obvious that electric power supplied nodes are more likely online
   longer than those battery supplied nodes.  And most of the nowadays
   intelligent equipments are aware of their power supply type.  But it
   is necessary that whether or not the power supply of a peer is
   limited by its battery can be queried through some method.

   The value for this property is either "true" or "false", in ASCII.
   If the peer in question is actually battery-limited, the value of
   this property wrt the peer is set to "true".

3.3.  Endpoint Property Type: network_access

   The third important endpoint property that will impact peer selection
   is the node access type.  If it is a node owned by home user, the
   access type can be DSL, or FTTB, or FTTH.  If it is deployed in a
   data center, we can specify a special access type for it, because it
   is more robust, and is more likely to have more network resources
   than home users.  A p2p application may have its own algorithm for
   peer selection if this information can be provided.

   The value for this property can be enumerated as "adsl", "ftth",
   "fttb", "dc", and etc.

4.  Security Considerations

   The indication of new endpoint properties to the ALTO clients may set
   targets for the malicious nodes to hack.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds the following new endpoint property type to the
   existing registry created by ALTO protocol [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].


   +---------------+---------------------------------------+
   |Identifier     |Intended Semantics                     |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------+
   |p2p_caching    |Whether the peer is a network cache,   |
   |               |value is "true" or "false", in ASCII.  |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------+
   |power_supply   |Whether the peer is battery-limited,   |
   |               |value is "true" or "false", in ASCII.  |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------+
   |network_access |The type of access network of the peer,|
   |               |value is enumerated as "adsl", "ftth", |
   |               |"fttb", "dc", in ASCII.                |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------+
