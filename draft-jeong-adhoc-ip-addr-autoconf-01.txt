Abstract 
    
   This document specifies the steps a node in ad hoc network takes in 
   deciding how to autoconfigure its IPv4 or IPv6 address in network 
   interface.  Because the ad hoc IP address autoconfiguration in this 
   document considers ad hoc network's partition and mergence, the 
   address duplication that can be caused by ad hoc network's mergence 
   can be resolved.

1. Terminology 
    
   This document uses the terminology described in [3][4].  In addition, 
   seven new terms are defined below: 
    
     Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) 
    
        The network where mobile nodes can communicate with one another 
        without preexisting communication infrastructure, such as base 
        station or access point. 
    
     Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) 
  
       The process by which a node, which lacks an IP address, 
       determines address, determines whether a candidate address it 
       has selected is available or not.  A node already equipped with 
       an IP address takes part in DAD in order to protect its IP 
       address from being accidentally used by another node. 
    
     Strong DAD

Internet-Draft    Ad Hoc IP Address Autoconfiguration     October 2003 
 
 
        The timed-based DAD for the purpose of checking if there is 
        address duplication in a connected MANET partition within a 
        finite bounded time interval [5]. 
   
     Weak DAD 
   
       The DAD for the purpose of detecting address duplication during 
       ad hoc routing.  Key is used for the purpose of detecting 
       duplicate IP addresses, which is selected to be unique by mobile 
       node.  When mobile node receives a routing control packet, it 
       compares the pairs of address and key contained in the packet 
       with those in the routing table or cache [5]. 
    
     Address Request (AREQ) 
         
        The message used during Strong DAD for the purpose of checking 
        if there is another node having the requested address [6]. 
    
     Address Reply (AREP) 
    
        The message used during Strong DAD for the purpose of indicating 
        the requested address has already been utilized [6]. 
    
     Address Error (AERR)  
    
        The message used during Weak DAD for the purpose of indicating 
        that an address duplication happened or that the address of peer 
        node has been changed. 
    
2. Introduction 
    
   IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration [5] provides a way to 
   autoconfigure either fixed or mobile nodes with one or more IPv6 
   addresses and default routes.  But this is not suitable for multi-hop 
   ad hoc networks that has dynamic network topology.  Ad hoc networks 
   become partitioned and merged as intermediate nodes move.  In this 
   environment, IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration should be able 
   to process the address duplication not only within a connected ad hoc 
   partition, but also in the case that two partitions having duplicate 
   addresses respectively become merged.  This document provides ad hoc 
   IP address autoconfiguration in IPv4 ad hoc network as well as in 
   IPv6 ad hoc network. 
    
3. Overview 
    
   IPv4 or IPv6 unicast address of ad hoc node is autoconfigured by IP 
   address autoconfiguration for ad hoc networks.  The configuration of 
   address is comprised of three steps; (a) selection of random address,

   (b) verification of the uniqueness of the address and (c) assignment 
   of the address into network interface.   
    
   The duplication address detection (DAD) proposed in this document not 
   only checks address duplication during the initialization of address 
   configuration, but also checks and resolves address duplication 
   detected by intermediate nodes during ad hoc routing.  Also, during 
   the resolution of address conflict, the sessions using the conflicted 
   address can be maintained until the sessions are closed. 
    
   The DAD for ad hoc network in this document is a hybrid scheme 
   consisting of two phases; (a) Strong DAD phase and (b) Weak DAD phase.  
   Within a connected ad hoc partition, Strong DAD can check quickly if 
   there is any address duplication or not.  During ad hoc routing, Weak 
   DAD can find out if address duplication has occurred or not, when two 
   or more MANET partitions having duplicate addresses are merged. 
    
4. Message Format for Ad Hoc IP Address Autoconfiguration 
    
4.1 Message Format for Ad Hoc IPv4 Address Autoconfiguration 
    
   The mechanism of this document needs new ICMPv4 types for ad hoc IPv4 
   address autoconfiguration.  Figure 1 shows the format of the messages 
   related to IPv4 address autoconfiguration.

                      type, the valid value is either 0 or 1.  Code 
                      value 1 in AERR message indicates that the peer 
                      node's address has been changed.  In the other

                      message. 
    
   AREQ and AREP messages are used during Strong DAD and AERR message 
   during Weak DAD.  Because AREQ message is forwarded by higher layer 
   than network layer through local broadcasting, "Identification" field 
   is necessary, in order not to flood the message sent previously again.

Internet-Draft    Ad Hoc IP Address Autoconfiguration     October 2003 
 
 
5. Ad Hoc IP Address Autoconfiguration 
    
   The procedure of ad hoc IP address autoconfiguration in an ad hoc 
   node is comprised of two phases; (a) Strong DAD phase and (b) Weak 
   DAD phase.  Especially, for Weak DAD, "Virtual IP Address" is used, 
   which is the combination of "IP Address" and "Key".  During ad hoc 
   routing, with the value of Key, Weak DAD can detect IP address 
   duplication.  Therefore, Weak DAD places a requirement for a new 
   field in the routing table -- namely, the inclusion of a "Key" field. 
   Also, most of routing control packets of ad hoc routing protocols 
   (e.g., link state packet) contain "Sequence Number" or 
   "Identification" field in order to allow a receiving node of the 
   control packets to determine whether it has recently seen copies of 
   the packets.  This field is also used for the purpose of detecting 
   address duplication by Weak DAD. 
    
   Because this document does not consider the global connectivity to 
   the Internet, it assumes that MANET is temporary network isolated 
   from the Internet and the scope of addresses used in MANET is not 
   global, but local.   
    
5.1 Ad Hoc IPv4 Address Autoconfiguration 
    
5.1.1 Network Prefix for IPv4 Ad Hoc Network 
    
   For IPv4 address, "169.254/16" is used as IPv4 MANET exclusive prefix, 
   IPV4_MANET_PREFIX [6].  Among IPV4_MANET_PREFIX, IPv4 addresses in 
   the range 1 ~ 2047 (TMP_ADDR) in the low-order 16 bits are used for 
   temporary IPv4 unicast address during Strong DAD.  The rest of 
   addresses in the range TMP_ADDR + 1 ~ 65534 in the low-order 16 bits 
   are used as tentative IPv4 address for actual IPv4 unicast address.  
   In the future, this prefix can be replaced with another one for ad 
   hoc network. 
    
5.1.2 Procedure of Ad Hoc IPv4 DAD 
    
   During Strong DAD phase, an ad hoc node autoconfigures a unique IPv4 
   address in its network interface within a limited scope of a 
   connected MANET partition and during Weak DAD phase, the node 
   participates in DAD and ad hoc routing as follows; 
    
   Step (a) : A node selects a temporary address and configures it in 
   network interface. 
    
   Step (b) : The node selects a tentative address and makes an AREQ 
   message for the address.  It initializes a variable for 
   retransmission of AREQ message, retrans_count, into 0.

Internet-Draft    Ad Hoc IP Address Autoconfiguration     October 2003 
 
 
   Step (c) : The node broadcasts the AREQ message in IPv4 MANET 
   broadcast address, 255.255.255.255, and increases the count for 
   transmission of AREQ message, retrans_count by 1.  It waits for AREP 
   message until the timer for Strong DAD expires.  If an AREP message 
   for the sent AREQ message arrives until the timer expires, the node 
   executes Step (e).  Otherwise, it executes Step (d). 
    
   Step (d) : If retrans_count is equal to DAD_RETRIES (e.g., 3), the 
   node goes to Step (f).  Otherwise, it goes to Step (c). 
    
   Step (e) : If the received AREP message is associated with the sent 
   AREQ message, the node returns to Step (b). 
    
   Step (f) : Because the requested address that is tentative is unique 
   in the connected partition, the node replaces the temporary address 
   with it as IPv4 unicast address of its network interface. 
    
   Step (g) : The node is ready to receive address autoconfiguration 
   message or ad hoc routing control packet.  Ad hoc routing protocol is 
   either proactive or reactive.  If the packet is address 
   autoconfiguration message, it executes Step (h).  If the received 
   packet is ad hoc routing control packet, it executes Step (l). 
    
   Step (h) : If the received message is AREQ message, first of all, it 
   checks whether the received message is what was received previously 
   on the basis of "Source IP Address" field of IP datagram containing 
   the message and "Identification" field within the message or not.  If 
   the packet is what was received previously, the node discards the 
   message, returning to Step (g).  Otherwise, the node executes Step 
   (i).  If the message is AREP, it executes Step (j).  If the message 
   is AERR, it executes Step (k). 
    
   Step (i) : The node compares its address with the requested address 
   in the message.  If two addresses are the same, it sends in unicast 
   the originator node an AREP message, indicating address duplication, 
   returning to Step (g).  Otherwise, it floods or broadcasts the 
   message to neighbors, returning to Step (g). 
    
   Step (j) : If Destination IP address of the AREP message is the same 
   as its own IP address and the duplicate address in the AREP message 
   is corresponding to its own IP address under tentative state during 
   Strong DAD, the node starts Strong DAD procedure again, namely 
   returning to Step (a).  If Destination IP address of the AREP message 
   is the same as its own but the duplicate address in the AREP message 
   isn't corresponding to its own under tentative state during Strong 
   DAD, it discards the message, returning to Step (g).  Otherwise, it 
   only relays the message in unicast towards Destination IP address of 
   the AREP message, returning to Step (g).  Notice that nodes under

   tentative state of Strong DAD for its address configuration SHOULD 
   NOT relay or forward other nodes' AREP messages. 
    
   Step (k) : If Destination IP address of the AERR message is the same 
   as its own IP address and the duplicate address in the AERR message 
   is the same as its own IP address, the node starts Strong DAD 
   procedure in order to autoconfigure a new address again, namely 
   returning to Step (a).  If Destination IP address of the AERR message 
   is the same as its own but the duplicate address in the AERR message 
   isn't the same as its own, node discards the message, returning to 
   Step (g).  Otherwise, it only relays the message in unicast towards 
   Destination IP address of the AERR message, returning to Step (g).  
   Notice that nodes under tentative state of Strong DAD for its address 
   configuration SHOULD NOT relay or forward other nodes' AERR messages. 
    
   Step (l) : The node investigates each IP address contained in control 
   packet to see whether for IP address, there is a matching entry in 
   routing table or cache.  If there is a matching entry and the values 
   of two "Key"s are different, because an IP address conflict has 
   happened, the node sends in unicast an AERR message, indicating 
   address conflict, to one of the nodes using the duplicate address 
   that are associated with different "Key"s, returning to Step (g), 
   which it selects one of these two nodes by local policy (e.g., random 
   selection).  Otherwise, it executes the rest of the procedure related 
   to processing ad hoc routing control packets, returning to Step (g). 
   Notice that there isn't any protection against accidental cases where 
   the two contenders for an IP address happen to select the same value 
   for "Key".  That should be okay as long as (i) the key is long (in 
   bits), and (ii) the nodes are quite capable of producing truly random 
   numbers.  Also, the intermediate routing points also have to maintain 
   the "Key" value for the two endpoints, at least during address 
   discovery.  Even in the accidental cases where the two contenders for 
   an IP address happen to select the same value for "Key", address 
   duplication MAY be detected with "Sequence Number" or 
   "Identification" field of the control packet.  Assume that a node 
   receives a routing control packet (e.g., link state packet).  If the 
   values of "IP Address" and "Key" fields within the packet are the 
   same as its own and the value of "Sequence Number" field within the 
   packet is higher than the counter value for its own "Sequence Number", 
   except sequence number wrap-around, the node MAY decide that address 
   duplication has happened and resolve the duplication [7]. 
    
5.2 Ad Hoc IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration 
    
5.2.1 Network Prefix for IPv6 Ad Hoc Network 
    
   For IPv6 address, "fec0:0:0:ffff::/64" is used as IPv6 MANET 
   exclusive prefix, IPV6_MANET_PREFIX [6].  Among the IPV6_MANET_PREFIX,

Internet-Draft    Ad Hoc IP Address Autoconfiguration     October 2003 
 
 
   "fec0:0:0:ffff::/96" is used as IPV6_MANET_INIT_PREFIX for temporary 
   unicast address during Strong DAD.  The low-order 32 bits of the 
   temporary address are configured with 32-bit pseudo random number.  
   The rest of address range of IPV6_MANET_PREFIX except 
   IPV6_MANET_INIT_PREFIX is used for actual unicast address.  The 
   address is tentative address until the uniqueness of it is verified 
   by Strong DAD. 
    
   Recently, IPv6 site-local address has been deprecated by IPv6 working 
   group.  Since IETF-56 meeting, IPv6 working group has been discussing 
   local prefix for local networks separated from the Internet, such as 
   ad hoc network [8].  If ad hoc prefix is determined by IPv6 working 
   group, IPV6_MANET_PREFIX will have the new one for ad hoc network. 
    
5.2.2 Procedure of Ad Hoc IPv6 DAD 
    
   An IPv6 ad hoc node autoconfigures a unique IPv6 address in its 
   network interface in the same way as an IPv4 ad hoc node like section 
   5.1.2. 
    
6. Maintenance of Upper-layer Session under Address Duplication 
    
   When address duplication happens and the duplicate address is 
   replaced with another, the sessions above network layer can be broken.  
   So, for the survivability of upper-layer sessions using the duplicate 
   address, the notification of address change between the peer nodes is 
   necessary. 
    
   In order to allow data packets related to the sessions using the 
   duplicate address to be forwarded to destination nodes for a while, 
   after sending error message (i.e., AERR message) to the node related 
   to the duplicate address, the intermediate nodes that have perceived 
   address duplication SHOULD continue to forward on-the-fly data 
   packets associated with the sessions using the duplicate address, on 
   the basis of Virtual IP Address (i.e., combination of IP address and 
   key), until the route entry for the duplicate address expires.  The 
   node that receives an AERR message SHOULD autoconfigure a new IPv6 
   address through Strong DAD and SHOULD simultaneously make the new 
   address that will be used by the old upper-layer sessions that used 
   the duplicate address as well as by new upper-layer sessions from 
   this time forward.  The node SHOULD inform the peer nodes of the 
   change of address by sending AERR messages with code 1.  The 
   "Originator's IP Address" field contains the duplicate address and 
   the "Requested IP Address" field contains a new address to be used 
   for the communication.  After receiving the AERR message, the peer 
   node sends its packets to the node through IP tunneling.  The 
   destination address in outer IP header is the new IP address of the 
   node that announced duplicate address and that in inner IP header is

   the duplicate IP address of the node.  When the node receives 
   tunneled packet from the peer node, it decapsulates the packet and 
   delivers the data in the packet to upper layer.  Both the node and 
   peer nodes maintain the information of duplicate address and use it 
   for processing IP tunneling. 
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   In order to provide secure ad hoc IP address autoconfiguration in ad 
   hoc network, we can use IPsec ESP with a null-transform to 
   authenticate ad hoc IP autoconfiguration messages or control packets, 
   which can be easily accomplished through the configuration of a group 
   pre-shared secret key for the trusted nodes.
