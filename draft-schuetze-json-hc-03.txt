1.  Introduction

   JSON Hypermedia Controls (JSON-HC) is a standard which establishes
   conventions for expressing hypermedia controls in JSON [RFC7159].

   The Hypermedia Controls of JSON-HC provide a way to figure out which
   Actions are possible with a Resource Object, what is the self URL of
   the Object and of which profile is the Resource Object.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  JSON-HC Documents

   A JSON-HC Document uses the format described in [RFC7159] and has the
   media type "application/vnd.hc+json".

   Its root object MUST be a Resource Object.

   For example:

         GET /orders/523 HTTP/1.1
         Host: example.org
         Accept: application/vnd.hc+json

         HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         Content-Type: application/vnd.hc+json

         {
           "self": "/orders/523",
           "profile": "https://example.org/rels/order",
           "https://example.org/rels/warehouse": "/warehouse/56",
           "https://example.org/rels/invoice": "/invoices/873",
           "currency": "USD",
           "status": "shipped",
           "total": 10.20
         }

   Here, we have a JSON-HC document representing an order resource with
   the URI "/orders/523" and the profile as in [RFC6906] defined as
   ""https://example.org/rels/order"".  It has "warehouse" and "invoice"
   links, and its own state in the form of "currency", "status", and
   "total" properties.

4.  Resource Objects

   A Resource Objects represents a resource.

   It has no reserved properties.

   A Resource Object MAY contain Hypermedia Controls with either a
   Target URL or an Embedded Resource Object as a value.

5.  Hypermedia Controls

   Resource Objects MAY contain Hypermedia Controls.

   A Hypermedia Control is a property name, which is either:

   o  an IANA link relation name

   o  or a valid URI

   The value of this Hypermedia Control must be an URL to the linked
   resource or an Embedded Resource Object.

   If the value is an URL, the Resource Object needs to be fetched
   ondemand with an additional request.

6.  Embedded Resource Object

   If the value of an Hypermedia Control is a JSON object, there is no
   additional request necessary to fetch the Resource Object for this
   Hypermedia Control.

7.  Refresh a Resource Object

   If the Resource Object has a "self" Hypermedia Control, the value
   MUST be an URL.  A request to the URL will provide the Resource
   Object.

8.  Target URL

   The target URL of an Hypermedia Control is either:

   o  the value of an Hypermedia Control, if it is an URL

   o  the "self" Hypermedia Control of the Embedded Resource Object

   If the Target URL is not an absolute URL, it must start with a "/"
   and any request to this Target URL will be preceded with the base
   path of the initially requested Document.

9.  Performing Actions

   The Target URL of an Hypermedia Control can be used as target for
   HTTP requests.

10.  Retrieve available HTTP methods

   JSON-HC does not provide an own way to define, which HTTP methods a
   JSON-HC Target URL may accept.

   If a server needs to list the possible HTTP methods available for a
   resource, it SHOULD provide an Allow Header [RFC7231].

                     OPTIONS /cancelation/123 HTTP/1.1

                     HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
                     Allow: POST, OPTIONS

   If the resource was requested with an unsupported method, the server
   should reply with _405 Method not Allowed_ HTTP Status Code.

11.  Profile of a Resource Object

   If the Resource Object has a profile Hypermedia Control, a client can
   use this to figure out of which kind the Resource Object is.

12.  Examples

   The following order resource has a self Hypermedia Control as defined
   by IANA Link Relations and a custom cancel Hypermedia Control.

         GET /orders/523 HTTP/1.1
         Host: example.org
         Accept: application/vnd.hc+json

         HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         Content-Type: application/vnd.hc+json

         {
           "self": "/orders/523",
           "profile": "https://example.org/rels/order",
           "https://example.org/rels/cancel": "/cancelation/873",
           "currency": "USD",
           "status": "created",
           "total": 10.20
         }

   If the client wants to cancel the order, it does a POST HTTP Request
   to the cancel Hypermedia Control.

                      POST /cancelation/123 HTTP/1.1

                      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

   If POST would be not available, the server responds with:

                      HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
                      Allow: DELETE

   A client might decide to use DELETE method instead of the hard coded
   POST method instead.

13.  Security Considerations

   Since JSON-HC documents are JSON documents, they inherit all security
   considerations of RFC 7159 [RFC7159].

Internet-Draft                   JSON-HC                   November 2016


   The linking part of the JSON-HC media type is not known to introduce
   any new security issues not already discussed in RFC 5988 [RFC5988]
   for generic use of web linking mechanisms.

   The JSON-HC documents follow the Web Origin Concept of RFC 6454
   [RFC6454] and by default only following hypermedia controls to
   documents of the same origin are allowed.  Network resources can also
   opt into letting other origins read their information, for example,
   using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing [CORS].

14.  Privacy Considerations

   Since JSON-HC documents are JSON documents, they also inherit all
   privacy considerations of RFC 7159 [RFC7159].  Thus the security
   goals like defined in RFC 6973 [RFC6973]: Confidentiality, Peer
   entity authentication, Unauthorized usage and Inappropriate usage
   need to be handled outside of the JSON-HC documents and are out of
   scope of this specification.

   For example JSON Web Tokens [RFC7519] or OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] can be
   used alongside of JSON-HC to ensure authentication and deny
   unauthorized usages and HTTPS [RFC2818] can be used to ensure
   confidentiality.
