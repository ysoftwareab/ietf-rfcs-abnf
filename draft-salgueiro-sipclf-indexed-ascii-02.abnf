   Shown below is approximately how this message would appear as a
   single record in a SIP CLF logging file if encoded according to the
   syntax described in this document.  Due to internet-draft
   conventions, this log entry has been split into seven lines, instead
   of the two lines that actually appear in a log file; and the tab
   characters have been padded out using spaces to simulate their
   appearance in a text terminal.
