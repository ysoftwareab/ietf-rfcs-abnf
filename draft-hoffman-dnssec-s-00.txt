            Session-baseed Authentication for DNS: DNSSEC-S
                       draft-hoffman-dnssec-s-00

Abstract

   DNSSEC as defined in RFCs 4033, 4034, and 4035 is based on
   authenticated messages.  That design has allowed DNSSEC to be
   deployed at the upper levels of the DNS tree, but operational issues
   with message-based authentication has caused lower levels fo the DNS
   tree to mostly forego DNSSEC.  This document extends DNSSEC with a
   second type of authentication, based on session authentication from
   TLS, that is easier to deploy by some (but certainly not all)
   authoritative DNS servers.  The goal is to have many more zones be
   DNSSEC-enabled.

   Note that this document does _not_ replace current DNSSEC.  A
   validating resolver needs to implement all of traditional DNSSEC, and
   might also implement the protocol defined here.  A server might
   protect the contents of DNS zones for which it is authoritative with
   traditional DNSSEC, with the protocol defined here, or both.  The
   protocol defined here is only useful for some authoritative servers,
   and is explicitly not useful for others.

1.  Introduction

   As stated in [RFC4033], "The Domain Name System Security Extensions
   (DNSSEC) add data origin authentication and data integrity to the
   Domain Name System".  The protocol described in [RFC4033], [RFC4034],
   and [RFC4035] provide those services by adding new resource records
   and specifying how to cryptographically validate the contents of
   those records.  In this document, DNSSEC as defined in [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035] and all RFCs that update those three is called
   "DNSSEC-M".  The designation "-M" means "message": those RFCs define
   secure message-based authentication for DNS messages.

   This document defines a second type of DNSSEC that can be used
   alongside DNSSEC-M.  This second type uses secure session-based
   authentication using TLS.  It is called "DNSSEC-S", where "-S" means
   "session".  In short, DNSSEC-S allows the validating resolver to
   authenticate the origin of the DNS data because it comes directly
   from the authoritative server during a TLS session; the TLS session
   also provides data integrity.  DNSSEC-S clients and servers MUST use
   TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].

   The protocol described in this document provides a mechanism could
   encourage many more organizations, particularly large organizations
   that already run secure web services, to enable DNSSEC on their
   zones.

1.1.  Use Cases

   Deploying DNSSEC-M has proven successful in some environments, but
   not in others.  At the time this document is published, the root of
   the DNS tree is secured with DNSSEC-M, as are many of the TLDs in the
   root.  However, only a few major content providers have signed their
   zones with DNSSEC-M.

   When asked why they don't sign their zones, these content providers
   give various reasons, but one major reason stands out.  The software
   that is used to sign zones for DNSSEC-M is often described as
   "complicated" and "fragile".  If a zone is not properly signed before
   it is published by the authoritative server, parts or all of the zone
   may become unavailable to recursive resolvers that perform DNSSEC-M
   validation.  Further, the signing software must be run periodically
   and the results must be correct; otherwise, the zone becomes
   unavailable and may stay that way for days even after the problem is
   discovered.

   Content providers say that the risk of their zone becoming
   unavailable due to the above problems with DNSSEC-M (as well as other
   issues) is not worth the positive attributes of DNSSEC-M, and
   therefore leave their zones unsigned.

   If a system can definitively eliminate this risk while introducing
   only much smaller risks, some content providers might consider
   authenticating their zones with DNSSEC.  DNSSEC-S proposes to be such
   a system.

1.2.  Use Cases Not Considered Here

   DNSSEC-S uses TLS for session security, and TLS also provides
   encryption of sessions.  However, the encrypted aspect of DNSSEC-S
   sessions is explicitly not considered a use case for DNSSEC-S.
   DNSSEC-S is not appropriate for all authoritative servers, so the
   encryption that comes as part of DNSSEC-S should only be considered a
   useful side-benefit, not a primary use case.  The DPRIVE Working
   Group in the IETF is currently considering mechanisms to encrypt
   communications with authoritative servers.

   The security of DNSSEC-S relies on keeping the TLS private key
   secret.  Because of this, DNSSEC-S is not appropriate for DNSSEC-
   protected zones where the nameservers are run by multiple
   organizations that have different abilities to protect a private key.
   As an obvious example, the DNS root is currently served by a dozen
   different organizations.  Because it is impossible to serve the
   current DNS using just DNSSEC-S, this document mandates that

   validating resolvers MUST support validating with DNSSEC-M if they
   also support validating with DNSSEC-S.

1.3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, BCP 14
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant CBOR
   implementations.

   This document creates two new terms, "DNSSEC-M" and "DNSSEC-S".  See
   Section 1 for their definition.  It also creates associated terms,
   "DS hash set" in Section 2.3 and "certificate hash set" in
   Section 2.5.

   A great deal of other DNSSEC-related terminology can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis].

2.  Protocol Description

2.1.  Overview

   A DNS client that wants authenticated answers to queries (such as a
   Security-Aware Recursive Name Server, a Security-Aware Resolver, or a
   Security-Aware Stub Resolver) can detect that an authoritative server
   is using DNSSEC-S when it gets the DS records for that authoritative
   server from the parent zone.  If one or more of those DS records have
   a digest type of DS-DIGEST-TBD, then the client can assume that the
   authoritative server speaks DNS over TLS as defined in this document,
   and that the TLS session can be authenticated with the contents of
   the DS record.

   After a TLS session is established, the DNS client and the server
   speak the normal DNS protocol (using the two-octet length extension
   for TCP) described in [RFC1035], except that the messages go in the
   TLS connection, not over UDP or TCP.  The DNS client treats all
   authoritative responses from the server as authenticated because they
   are received in the TLS session.

   DNSSEC-S does not have the problems listed for DNSSEC-M listed in
   Section 1.1.  There is no DNS-specific cryptography in DNSSEC-S;
   instead, it relies on TLS cryptography which is already well
   understood.  There is no need to sign anything in a zone or to
   maintain the zone signing keys.

2.2.  Service Discovery and Authentication Through a New DS Type

   A DNSSEC-S client discovers that an authoritative server supports
   DNSSEC-S by querying the authoritative server's parent for the DS
   record set, and noting if any of the DS records are in the format
   given here.  There is a DNSSEC-S DS record in the parent for each TLS
   certificate that the authoritative server might present when serving
   DNSSEC-S.

   The DS record in the parent zone for DNSSEC-S has the same format as
   other DS records, but the values in some of the fields are different.
   For DNSSEC-S, the values MUST be:

   o  Key Tag - 0

   o  Algorithm - The signing algorithm of the TLS certificate

   o  Digest Type - DS-DIGEST-TBD

   o  Digest - The SHA-256 [SHA256] hash of the authenticating public
      key in the TLS certificate

   The display format is unchanged from Section 5.3 of [RFC4034].

2.3.  Client Preparation Before Establishing a TLS Connection

   The client validates the DS resource record set in the parent for a
   zone; if the resource record set does not validate, the client MUST
   NOT use DNSSEC-S to authenticate values in the zone.

   The client creates a data structure called the "DS hash set".  Each
   member of the data structure consists of a hash value obtained from
   the DS records that have Digest Type DS-DIGEST-TBD.  DS records with
   Digest Type other than DS-DIGEST-TBD MUST NOT be used to create the
   DS hash set.

   If the DS hash set is empty, the client MUST NOT attempt to establish
   a TLS connection.

2.4.  Establishing the TLS Session

   The client chooses a record from the DS hash set and starts a TLS
   session on port 443 with the server at one of the IP addresses from
   the record.  Both client and server MUST use TLS 1.3
   [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].

   ***

Internet-Draft                  DNSSEC-S                       June 2017


   There are two proposals for how to connect to the TLS server: on port
   443 using ALPN [RFC7301] and ALPN identifier ALPN-TBD, or on port
   PORT-TBD (a new port).  Both proposals have the same cryptographic
   properties, and almost identical properties for middleboxes.  One or
   the other needs to be chosen during the discussion of this protocol.

   ***

   Depending on the choice made, one of the following statements will be
   made in the protocol.

   o  The client MUST identify the session with ALPN using ALPN-TBD as
      an identifier to establish the TLS session.

   o  The client MUST use port PORT-TBD to establish the TLS session.

   The registration for one or the other appear in Section 6.

2.5.  Authenticating the TLS Session

   The client receives the TLS Certificates message from the server.
   Note that the Certificate message might contain one or more raw
   public keys (described in [RFC7250].  For each certificate in the
   Certificates message, the client hashes the public key in the
   certificate with SHA-256 and adds it to a data structure called the
   "certificate hash set".

   The client then compares the the first element from the DS hash set
   to the elements in the certificate hash set.  If there is a match,
   the certificate associated with that hash is considered authenticated
   for TLS.  If there is no match, the client compares each of the
   remaining elements from the DS hash set, searching for a match.

   If there is no match for any element in the DS hash set in the
   certificate hash set, the client MUST terminate the connection with
   an authentication failure as described in [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].  In
   this case, the client MUST NOT use DNSSEC-S with this server for this
   session, and SHOULD NOT try again to use DNSSEC-S with that server
   until the signature on the DS resource record set has expired.

2.6.  Continuing the Authenticated Session

   After a TLS session is established, the DNS client and the server
   speak the normal DNS protocol (using the two-octet length extension
   for TCP) described in [RFC1035], except that the messages go in the
   TLS connection, not over UDP or TCP.  The DNS client treats all
   authoritative responses from the server as authenticated because they
   are received in the TLS session.

3.  Updates to RFC 4033, 4034, and 4035

   *** This section will list specific textual updates to the base
   DNSSEC-M RFCs to allow for DNSSEC-S.  The section might get long; if
   so, it will be broken into sub-sections for easier commenting.  This
   section is a placeholder for later drafts if this work is adopted.
   ***

   o  Any authoritative answer from an authoritative server is
      considered validated if it was obtained with DNSSEC-S.  [RFC4035]
      Section 5 (and maybe 4?).  Non-authoritative answers are not
      considered validated.  This will need a careful list of
      restrictions (Answer section, AA bit set, ...).

   o  A DS record with Digest Type DS-DIGEST-TBD MUST NOT be used for
      chaining with DNSKEY records.  [RFC4034] Section 5.

   o  There are probably other updates.

4.  Additional Considerations

4.1.  Effect of DNSSEC-S on Resolvers that Only Validate with DNSSEC-M

   DNSSEC-S is designed to not affect resolvers that only validate with
   DNSSEC-M.  The choice of using DS-DIGEST-TBD in the DS record in the
   parent will cause a resolver that only knows about DNSSEC-M to think
   that the child zone is unsigned.  Section 5.2 of [RFC4035] says that
   the following must hold:

   "The Algorithm and Key Tag in the DS RR match the Algorithm field and
   the key tag of a DNSKEY RR in the child zone's apex DNSKEY RRset,
   and, when the DNSKEY RR's owner name and RDATA are hashed using the
   digest algorithm specified in the DS RR's Digest Type field, the
   resulting digest value matches the Digest field of the DS RR."

   A validator that only knows DNSSEC-M will not know how to hash "using
   the digest algorithm specified in the DS RR's Digest Type field"
   because it will not know the algorithm for DS-DIGEST-TBD.

4.2.  Simultaneous Use of Both DNSSEC-M and DNSSEC-S

   An authoritative server that uses DNSSEC-S for authentication can
   also use DNSSEC-M if it wishes.  That is, such a server can still
   answer queries with the DO bit set just as it would have if the
   queries came over UDP or TCP instead of over TLS.  In order to do
   this, the authoritative server would need at least two DS records in
   its parent's zone, one for DNSSEC-M and one for DNSSEC-S.




Hoffman & Larson        Expires December 30, 2017               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  DNSSEC-S                       June 2017


   Similarly, a DNS client that is using DNSSEC-S can still request
   DNSSEC-M records (using the DO bit) and process them as it would if
   those records were received over UDP or TCP (or out of band).  A DNS
   client may successfully establishes a DNSSEC-S session and receive
   DNSSEC-M responses that do not validate; the result of such a
   situation is explicitly undefined in this document.

4.3.  Standby Keys

   An authoritative server can deploy standby keys whose private keys
   are not in production.  To do this, they simply add NS records whose
   DNSSEC NS Label is the hash of the not-yet-operational public key,
   and the A or AAAA records for that name point to the same servers as
   the operational NS records.

   This scheme will make validators that use DNSSEC-S to be slightly
   slower because they need to perform one extra decoding per standby
   key, and possibly one extra SHA-256 hash execution per comparison
   with certificates from the TLS server.

4.4.  DoS Attacks on DNSSEC-S

   All TLS servers are susceptible to CPU-exhaustion attacks from
   attackers who can generate traffic that requires the server to do
   asymmetric computations.  Zones that use DNSSEC-S are as susceptible
   to these denial-of-service attacks as web servers that use HTTPS and
   mail servers that use SMTPS.  TLS 1.3 will be less susceptible to
   such attacks than earlier versions of TLS, but some attacks are still
   possible.

   Note that DNSSEC-M with online signing of DNSSEC records are also
   susceptible to DoS attacks.  This area has not been heavily studied,
   but it is possible that DNSSEC-S servers will be less susceptible to
   CPU exhaustion attacks than DNSSEC-M servers that use online signing.

5.  Security Considerations

   *** This section will clearly be much longer before the document is
   finished.  Proposed additions are welcome.  ***

   The security of DNSSEC-S is completely dependent on the ability of
   DNSSEC-S clients to correctly match the public keys in the TLS
   certificate messages with the values in the DNSSEC-S NS Labels.  A
   DNSSEC-S client that mis-implements the rules in this protocol is
   capable of being fooled into validating answers that it should not.

   An authoritative server that supports both DNSSEC-S and DNSSEC-M, and
   sends DNSSEC-M records that cause the authoritative answers to not

   validate in DNSSEC-M, will likely have nondeterministic results when
   queried; see Section 4.2.

   DNSSEC-S is susceptible to denial-of-service attacks that DNSSEC-M
   using offline signing is not; see Section 4.4.

6.  IANA Considerations

   *** If ALPN is chosen, a template for registering ALPN-TBD will go
   here.  However, if a new port is chosen, a template for registering
   port PORT-TBD will go here.  Only one of these two registrations will
   appear here.  ***
