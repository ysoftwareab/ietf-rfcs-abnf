        This document provides methods and settings 
        for using IPv6 to communicate among nodes within range of one another
        over a single IEEE 802.11-OCB link. Support for these methods and
        settings require minimal changes to existing stacks. This document
        also describes limitations associated with using these methods.
        Optimizations and usage of IPv6 over more complex scenarios

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        This document provides a baseline for using IPv6 to 
        communicate among nodes in range of one another over a single IEEE 802.11-OCB link
        <xref target="IEEE-802.11-2016" format="default"/> (a.k.a., 802.11p;
	see Appendices <xref target="i802.11p" format="counter"/>,
        <xref target="introduced-by-OCB" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="software-changes" format="counter"/>) 
        with minimal changes to existing stacks. Moreover, the document
	identifies the limitations
        of such usage. Concretely, the document describes the layering 
        of IPv6 networking on top of the IEEE Std 802.11 MAC layer or an IEEE Std 802.3 
        MAC layer with a frame translation underneath. The resulting stack is derived from IPv6 
        over Ethernet <xref target="RFC2464" format="default"/> but operates over 802.11-OCB to provide at least P2P (point-to-point) connectivity 
        using IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) and link-local addresses. 
      </t>
      <t>
	   The IPv6 network layer operates on 802.11-OCB in the same
	   manner as operating on the Ethernet with the following
	   exceptions:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
	    Exceptions due to the different operation of the IPv6 network
	    layer on 802.11 compared to the Ethernet. The operation of IP 
        on Ethernet is described in <xref target="RFC1042" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC2464" format="default"/>.
	    
	  </li>
        <li>
	    Exceptions due to the OCB nature of 802.11-OCB compared to
	    802.11.  This has impacts on security, privacy, subnet
	    structure, and movement detection.  Security and
	    privacy recommendations are discussed in Sections <xref
	    target="slaac" format="counter"/> and <xref target="Security" format="counter"/>.  The subnet structure is described
	    in <xref target="subnet-structure" format="default"/>.  The movement
	    detection on OCB links is not described in this document.
        Likewise, ND extensions and IP Wireless Access in Vehicular
	Environments (IPWAVE) optimizations for vehicular communications are
        not in scope of this document.  The expectation is that further specifications will be edited to cover 
        more complex vehicular networking scenarios.

      <name>Communication Scenarios Where IEEE 802.11-OCB Links Are Used</name>
      <t>
        IEEE 802.11-OCB networks are used for vehicular
        communications as 'Wireless Access in Vehicular
        Environments'. In particular, we refer the reader to <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking" format="default"/>, which lists
        some scenarios and requirements for IP in Intelligent
        Transportation Systems (ITS).
      </t>

      <t>
	The link model is the following: STA --- 802.11-OCB --- STA.
	In vehicular networks, STAs can be IP-RSUs and/or IP-OBUs. 
    All links are assumed to be P2P, and multiple links can be on one radio 
    interface. While 802.11-OCB is clearly specified and a legacy IPv6
    stack can operate on such links, the use of the operating environment 
    (vehicular networks) brings in new perspectives.

        <t>
          The default MTU for IP packets on 802.11-OCB is inherited 
          from <xref target="RFC2464" format="default"/> and, as such, is 1500 octets. 
          As noted in <xref target="RFC8200" format="default"/>, every link on the Internet must have a
          minimum MTU of 1280 octets and must follow the other 
          recommendations, especially with regard to fragmentation.

        <t>
	  The IPv6 packet transmitted on 802.11-OCB is

	  with EtherType Protocol Discrimination (EPD; see <xref target="epd" format="default"/>), the value of the Type field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to
	  0x86DD (IPv6).  The mapping to the 802.11 data service <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> 
      use a 'priority' value of 1  (QoS with a 'Background' user priority),

        <name>Link-Local Addresses</name>
        <t>
	  There are several types of IPv6 addresses <xref target="RFC4291" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC4193" format="default"/> that may be
	  assigned to an 802.11-OCB interface.  Among these types of
	  addresses, only the IPv6 link-local addresses can be formed

	  time (the period of time before an interface starts using an address
	  different from the LL one).
        </t>
        <t>
	  If the IPv6 link-local address is formed using an EUI-64
	  identifier, then the mechanism for forming that address is
	  the same mechanism as that used to form an IPv6 link-local
	  address on Ethernet links. Moreover, regardless of whether the interface
      identifier is derived from the EUI-64 identifier, its length is 64 bits,
      as is the case for the Ethernet <xref target="RFC2464" format="default"/>.

        <name>Stateless Autoconfiguration</name>
        <t>
	  The steps a host takes in deciding how to
      autoconfigure its interfaces in IPv6 are described 
      in <xref target="RFC4862" format="default"/>.  This section describes
	  the formation of Interface Identifiers for 'Global' or 'Unique Local' IPv6 addresses.  Interface Identifiers
	  for 'link-local' IPv6 addresses are discussed in <xref target="ll" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> method for forming
          stable Interface Identifiers (IIDs) is described in <xref target="RFC8064" format="default"/>.  The method of forming IIDs described in
          <xref target="RFC2464" sectionFormat="of" section="4"/> <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used during
          transition time, particularly for IPv6 link-local
          addresses.  Regardless of the method used to form the IID, 
          its length is 64 bits, similarly to IPv6 over Ethernet <xref target="RFC2464" format="default"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The bits in the IID have no specific meaning,
          and the identifier should be treated as an opaque value.
          The bits 'Universal' and 'Group' in the identifier of an
          802.11-OCB interface, which is an IEEE link-layer address, are
	  significant.  The details of this significance are 
          described in <xref target="RFC7136" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
	  Semantically opaque IIDs, instead of 
	  meaningful IIDs derived from a valid and
	  meaningful MAC address (<xref target="RFC2464" sectionFormat="comma" section="4"/>), help avoid certain privacy risks (see the risks
	  mentioned in <xref target="privacy-opaque-iid" format="default"/>).  If
	  semantically opaque IIDs are needed, they
	  may be generated using the method for generating
	  semantically opaque IIDs with IPv6
	  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration given in <xref target="RFC7217" format="default"/>.  Typically, an opaque IID is formed starting from identifiers different
	  from the MAC addresses and from cryptographically strong
	  material.  Thus, privacy-sensitive information is absent
	  from Interface IDs because it is impossible to calculate
	  back the initial value from which the Interface ID was first
	  generated.
        </t>
  
        <t>
	  Some applications that use IPv6 packets on 802.11-OCB links
	  (among other link types) may benefit from IPv6 addresses
	  whose IIDs don't change too often.  It is
	  <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to use the mechanisms described in <xref target="RFC7217"/> to
	  permit the use of stable IIDs that do not
	  change within one subnet prefix.  A possible source for the
	  Net_Iface parameter is a virtual interface name or logical
	  interface name that is decided by a local administrator.

        <t>
	  When vehicles are in close range, a subnet may be formed over
      802.11-OCB interfaces (not by their in-vehicle interfaces).  
      A Prefix List conceptual data structure (<xref target="RFC4861"
      sectionFormat="comma" section="5.1"/>) is maintained for each
	  802.11-OCB interface.
        </t>
        <t>
	  The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol (ND) requires reflexive properties
      (bidirectional connectivity), which is generally, though not always, the case for P2P OCB links.
      IPv6 ND also requires transitive properties for DAD and AR, so an IPv6 subnet can be mapped
      on an OCB network only if all nodes in the network share a single
      physical broadcast domain. The extension to IPv6 ND operating on a
      subnet that covers multiple OCB links and does not fully overlap
      (i.e., non-broadcast multi-access (NBMA)) is not in scope of this document.
      Finally, IPv6 ND requires permanent connectivity of all nodes in the subnet
      to defend their addresses -- in other words, very stable network conditions.

        </t>
        <t>
	  The structure of this subnet is ephemeral in that it is
	  strongly influenced by the mobility of vehicles: the hidden
	  terminal effects appear, and the 802.11 networks in OCB mode may
	  be considered ad hoc networks with an addressing model,
	  as described in <xref target="RFC5889" format="default"/>.  On the other hand,
	  the structure of the internal subnets in each vehicle is
	  relatively stable.
        </t>
        <t>
	  As recommended in <xref target="RFC5889" format="default"/>, when the timing
	  requirements are very strict (e.g., fast-drive-through IP-RSU
	  coverage), no on-link subnet prefix should be configured on
	  an 802.11-OCB interface.  In such cases, the exclusive use
	  of IPv6 link-local addresses is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>.
        </t>
        <t>
	  Additionally, even if the timing requirements are not very
	  strict (e.g., the moving subnet formed by two following
	  vehicles is stable, a fixed IP-RSU is absent), the subnet is
	  disconnected from the Internet (i.e., a default route is absent),
	  and the addressing peers are equally qualified (that is, it is impossible
	  to determine whether some vehicle owns and distributes
	  addresses to others), the use of link-local addresses is
	  <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>.
        </t>
        <t>
	   The baseline ND protocol <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/> <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be supported over 802.11-OCB links.
	   Transmitting ND packets may prove to have some performance
	   issues, as mentioned in <xref target="address-mapping-multicast" format="default"/> and
       <xref target="nd-wireless" format="default"/>.  
       These issues may be exacerbated in OCB mode.
	   Solutions for these problems should consider the OCB mode
	   of operation. Future solutions to OCB should consider solutions
       for avoiding broadcast. The best of current knowledge 
       indicates the kinds of issues that may arise with ND in 
       OCB mode; they are described in <xref target="nd-wireless" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
	  Protocols like Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC6275" format="default"/>
	  <xref target="RFC3963" format="default"/> and
	  DNAv6 <xref target="RFC6059" format="default"/>, which depend on timely
	  movement detection, might need additional tuning work to
	  handle the lack of link-layer notifications during handover.
	  This topic is left for further study.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
        Any security mechanism at the IP layer or above that may be
        implemented for the general case of IPv6 may also be implemented
        for IPv6 operating over 802.11-OCB.
      </t>
      <t>
	The OCB operation does not use existing 802.11
	link-layer security mechanisms.  There is no encryption
	applied below the network layer running on 802.11-OCB.  At
	the application layer, the IEEE 1609.2 document <xref target="IEEE-1609.2" format="default"/> provides security services for
	certain applications to use; application-layer mechanisms are
	out of scope of this document.  On the other hand, a security
	mechanism provided at the networking layer, such as IPsec <xref target="RFC4301" format="default"/>, may provide data security protection to a
	wider range of applications.
      </t>
      <t>
        802.11-OCB does not provide any cryptographic protection because it operates outside the context of a BSS (no
        Association Request/Response or Challenge messages). 
        Therefore, an attacker can sniff or inject traffic while within 
        range of a vehicle or IP-RSU (by setting an interface card's frequency to the proper range).  
        Also, an attacker may not adhere to the legal limits
        for radio power and can use a very sensitive directional antenna; 
        if attackers wish to attack a given exchange, they do not necessarily 
        need to be in close physical proximity. Hence, such a link is less protected than
        commonly used links (a wired link or the aforementioned 802.11 links with link-layer security).
      </t>
      <t>Therefore, any node can join a subnet and directly communicate with any
    nodes on the subset, including potentially impersonating another node. This 
    design allows for a number of threats outlined in <xref
    target="RFC6959" sectionFormat="of" section="3"/>. 
    While not widely deployed, SEND <xref target="RFC3971" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC3972" format="default"/> is a solution 
    that can address spoof-based attack vectors.
      </t>
      <section anchor="Privacy" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Privacy Considerations</name>

        <t>
          As with all Ethernet and 802.11 interface identifiers <xref target="RFC7721" format="default"/>, the identifier of an 802.11-OCB
          interface may involve privacy, MAC address spoofing, and IP
          hijacking risks.  A vehicle embarking an IP-OBU
          whose egress interface is 802.11-OCB may expose itself to
          eavesdropping and subsequent correlation of data. This may
          reveal data considered private by the vehicle owner; there
          is a risk of being tracked.  In outdoor public
          environments, where vehicles typically circulate, the
          privacy risks are greater than in indoor settings.
          It is highly likely that attacker sniffers are deployed
          along routes that listen for IEEE frames, including IP
          packets, of vehicles passing by.  For this reason, in 802.11-OCB deployments, there is a strong necessity to use
          protection tools such as dynamically changing MAC addresses
          (<xref target="mac-change" format="default"/>), semantically opaque Interface
          Identifiers, and stable Interface Identifiers (<xref target="slaac"
	  format="default"/>).  An example of a change policy is to change the MAC 
          address of the OCB interface each time the system boots up. 
          This may help mitigate privacy risks to a
          certain level. Furthermore,  for privacy concerns, <xref target="RFC8065"
	  format="default"/> recommends using an address-generation scheme
	  rather than generating addresses from a fixed link-layer address.
          However, there are some specificities related to vehicles. Since roaming is an important
          characteristic of moving vehicles, the use of the same Link-Local Address over time 
          can indicate the presence of the same vehicle in different places and thus lead to location tracking. 
          Hence, a vehicle should get hints about a change of environment (e.g., engine running, GPS, etc.) 
          and renew the IID in its LLAs.

        <section anchor="privacy-opaque-iid" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Privacy Risks of Meaningful Information in Interface IDs</name>
          <t>
	    The privacy risks of using MAC addresses displayed in
	    Interface Identifiers are important.  IPv6 packets can
	    be captured easily on the Internet and on-link on public
	    roads.  For this reason, an attacker may realize many
	    attacks on privacy.  One such attack on 802.11-OCB is to
	    capture, store, and correlate company ID information
	    present in the MAC addresses of a large number of cars (e.g., listening for
	    Router Advertisements or other IPv6 application data
	    packets, and recording the value of the source address in
	    these packets).  Further correlation of this information
	    with other data captured by other means or other visual
	    information (e.g., car color) may constitute privacy
	    risks.
          </t>

      </section>
      <section anchor="mac-change" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>MAC Address and Interface ID Generation</name>
        <t>
	  In 802.11-OCB networks, the MAC addresses may change during
	  well-defined renumbering events.  At the moment the MAC
	  address is changed on an 802.11-OCB interface, all the
	  Interface Identifiers of IPv6 addresses assigned to that
	  interface <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> change.
        </t>
        <t>
	  Implementations should use a policy dictating when the MAC address is changed on the 802.11-OCB interface.  
      For more information on the motivation of this policy, please refer to
	  the privacy discussion in <xref target="introduced-by-OCB" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
	  A 'randomized' MAC address has the following
	  characteristics:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
              The "Local/Global" bit is set to "locally administered".
            </li>
          <li>
              The "Unicast/Multicast" bit is set to "Unicast".
            </li>
          <li>
              The 46 remaining bits are set to a random value using a
              random number generator that meets the requirements of
              <xref target="RFC4086" format="default"/>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          To meet the randomization requirements for the 46 remaining
          bits, a hash function may be used. For example, the hash function
	  defined in <xref target="SHA256" format="default"/>
          may be used with the input of a 256-bit local secret, the 'nominal'
	  MAC address of the interface, and a representation of the date and
	  time of the renumbering event. 
        </t>
        <t>
	  A randomized Interface ID has the same characteristics of a
	  randomized MAC address except for the length in bits.

        <name>Pseudonymization Impact on Confidentiality and Trust</name>
        <t>
       Vehicle and drivers privacy relies on pseudonymization mechanisms
       such as the ones described in <xref target="mac-change" format="default"/>.
       This pseudonymization means that upper-layer protocols and applications
       <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> rely on layer-2 or layer-3 addresses to assume that the other participant can be trusted.

        The term "802.11p" is an earlier definition.  The behavior of

        Management Information Base (MIB) attribute "OCBActivated"
        <xref target="IEEE-802.11-2016" format="default"/>.  Whenever OCBActivated is

      <name>Aspects Introduced by OCB Mode to 802.11</name>
      <t>
        In IEEE 802.11-OCB mode, all nodes in the wireless range
        can directly communicate with each other without involving
        authentication or association procedures.  In OCB mode, the
        manner in which channels are selected and used is simplified
        compared to when in BSS mode.  Contrary to BSS mode, at the link
        layer, it is necessary to statically set the same channel
        number (or frequency) on two stations that need to communicate
        with each other (in BSS mode, this channel set operation is
        performed automatically during 'scanning').  The manner in
        which stations set their channel number in OCB mode is not
        specified in this document.  Stations STA1 and STA2 can
        exchange IP packets only if they are set to the same channel.
        At the IP layer, they then discover each other by using the IPv6
        Neighbor Discovery protocol.  The allocation of a particular
        channel for a particular use is defined statically in
        standards authored by ETSI in Europe, the FCC in the United States of America, and
        similar organizations in South Korea, Japan, and other parts of
        the world.
      </t>
      <t>
	Briefly, the IEEE 802.11-OCB mode has the following
	properties:

      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li> 
            The use by each node of a 'wildcard' BSS identifier (BSSID) (i.e., each bit
            of the BSSID is set to 1).
          </li>
        <li> No IEEE 802.11 beacon frames are transmitted. </li>
        <li> No authentication is required in order to be able to communicate.</li>
        <li> No association is needed in order to be able to communicate.</li>
        <li> No encryption is provided in order to be able to communicate.</li>
        <li> Flag dot11OCBActivated is set to "true". </li>
      </ul>
      <t>

	All the nodes in the radio communication range (IP-OBU and IP-RSU)
	receive all the messages transmitted (IP-OBU and IP-RSU) within the
	radio communication range.  The MAC CDMA function resolves any
	eventual conflict(s).
      </t>
      <t>
        The message exchange diagram in <xref target="fig_mess-exch" format="default"/>
        illustrates a comparison between traditional 802.11 and 802.11
        in OCB mode.  The 'Data' messages can be IP packets such as
        HTTP or others.  Other 802.11 management and control frames
        (non-IP) may be transmitted, as specified in the 802.11
        standard.  The names of these messages as
        currently specified by the 802.11 standard are listed in <xref target="OCB-messages" format="default"/>.

      <t>
	The 802.11-OCB interface was specified in <xref target="IEEE-802.11p-2010" format="default"/>, Amendment 6: Wireless
	Access in Vehicular Environments, as an amendment
	to <xref target="IEEE-802.11-2007"/>.  Since then, this amendment
	has been integrated into <xref target="IEEE-802.11-2012"/> and <xref target="IEEE-802.11-2016" format="default"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
	In <xref target="IEEE-802.11p-2010" format="default"/>, anything qualified specifically as
	"OCBActivated" or "outside the context of a basic service"
	that is set to be "true" actually refers to OCB aspects
	introduced to 802.11.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order to delineate the aspects introduced by 802.11-OCB to
        802.11, we refer to the earlier <xref target="IEEE-802.11p-2010" format="default"/>.  The amendment is concerned with
        vehicular communications, where the wireless link is similar
        to that of Wireless LAN (using a PHY layer specified by
        802.11a/b/g/n) but needs to cope with the high mobility
        factor inherent in scenarios of communications between moving
        vehicles and between vehicles and fixed infrastructure
        deployed along roads.  While 'p' is a letter identifying the
        Amendment, just like 'a', 'b', 'g', and 'n' are, 'p' is concerned
        more with MAC modifications and is slightly concerned with PHY
        modifications; the others are mainly about PHY modifications.
        It is possible in practice to combine a 'p' MAC with an 'a'
        PHY by operating outside the context of a BSS with Orthogonal
	Frequency Division
      Multiplexing (OFDM) at
        5.4 GHz and 5.9 GHz.
      </t>
      <t>
        The 802.11-OCB links are specified to be as compatible as
        possible with the behavior of 802.11a/b/g/n and future
        generation IEEE WLAN links.  From the IP perspective, an
        802.11-OCB MAC layer offers practically the same interface to
        IP as 802.11a/b/g/n and 802.3.  A packet sent by an IP-OBU
        may be received by one or multiple IP-RSUs.  The link-layer
        resolution is performed by using the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
        protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
        To support this similarity statement (IPv6 is layered on top
        of LLC on top of 802.11-OCB in the same way that IPv6 is
        layered on top of LLC on top of 802.11a/b/g/n (for WLAN) or
        on top of LLC on top of 802.3 (for Ethernet)), it is
        useful to analyze the differences between the 802.11-OCB and
        802.11 specifications.  During this analysis, we note that
        whereas 802.11-OCB lists relatively complex and numerous
        changes to the MAC layer (and very few to the PHY layer),
        there are only a few characteristics that may be important
        for an implementation transmitting IPv6 packets on 802.11-OCB
        links.
      </t>

      <t>
        The most important 802.11-OCB aspect that influences the IPv6
        functioning is the OCB characteristic; an additional, less
        direct influence is the maximum bandwidth afforded by the PHY
        modulation/demodulation methods and channel access specified
        by 802.11-OCB.  The maximum bandwidth theoretically possible
        in 802.11-OCB is 54 Mbit/s (when using, for example, the
        following parameters: a 20 MHz channel; modulation of 64-QAM;
        a coding rate R of 3/4). With regard to IP over 802.11-OCB, in
	practice, a commonly observed figure is 12 Mbit/s; this bandwidth allows
        the operation of a wide range of protocols relying on IPv6.
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
            Operation outside the context of a BSS (OCB): The 802.11-OCB links
	    (previously 802.11p) are operated without a BSS.  This means that IEEE 802.11
            beacon, Association Request/Response, Authentication
            Request/Response, and similar frames are not used. The used
            identifier of BSS (BSSID) always has a hexadecimal value of
            0xffffffffffff (48 '1' bits, represented as MAC address
            ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff; otherwise, the 'wildcard' BSSID), as
            opposed to an arbitrary BSSID value set by an administrator
            (e.g., 'My-Home-AccessPoint').  The OCB operation -- namely,
            the lack of beacon-based scanning and lack of
            authentication -- should be taken into account when the
            Mobile IPv6 protocol <xref target="RFC6275" format="default"/> and the
            protocols for IP layer security <xref target="RFC4301" format="default"/>
            are used.  The way these protocols adapt to OCB is not
            described in this document.
          </li>

        <li>
            Timing Advertisement: This is a new message defined in
            802.11-OCB that does not exist in 802.11a/b/g/n.  This
            message is used by stations to inform other stations about
            the value of time.  It is similar to the time delivered
            by a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) (e.g., Galileo, GPS, etc.) or by a cellular
            system.  This message is optional for implementation.
          </li>

        <li>
            Frequency range: This is a characteristic of the PHY layer; it has
	    almost no impact on the interface between MAC and IP. However, it is worth considering that the
            frequency range is regulated by a regional authority
            (ARCEP, ECC/CEPT based on ENs from ETSI, FCC, etc.); as
            part of the regulation process, specific applications are
            associated with specific frequency ranges.  
   In the case of 802.11-OCB, the regulator associates a set of frequency
   ranges or slots within a band to the use of applications of vehicular
   communications in a band known as "5.9 GHz".
            The 5.9 GHz band is different from the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
            bands used by Wireless LAN. However, as with Wireless LAN, the
	    operation of 802.11-OCB in 5.9 GHz bands does not require a
	    license in the EU (in the US, the 5.9 GHz is a licensed band of
	    spectrum; for the fixed infrastructure, explicit FCC authorization
	    is required; for an on-board device, a 'licensed-by-rule' concept
	    applies, where rule certification conformity is required). Technical
            conditions are different from those of the "2.4 GHz"
            or "5 GHz" bands.  The allowed power levels and, implicitly, the
            maximum allowed distance between vehicles is 33 dBm for
            802.11-OCB (in Europe) compared to 20 dBm for Wireless
            LAN 802.11a/b/g/n; this leads to a maximum distance of
            approximately 1 km compared to approximately 50 m.
            Additionally, specific conditions related to congestion
            avoidance, jamming avoidance, and radar detection are
            imposed on the use of DSRC (in the US) and on the use of
            frequencies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (in
            the EU) compared to Wireless LAN (802.11a/b/g/n).
          </li>
        <li>
            'Half-rate' encoding: As the frequency range, this
            parameter is related to PHY and thus does not have much
            impact on the interface between the IP layer and the
            MAC layer.
          </li>
        <li>
            In vehicular communications using 802.11-OCB links, there
            are strong privacy requirements with respect to
            addressing.  While the 802.11-OCB standard does not
            specify anything in particular with respect to MAC
            addresses, in these settings, there is a strong need
            for a dynamic change of these addresses (as opposed to the
            non-vehicular settings -- real wall protection -- where
            fixed MAC addresses do not currently pose privacy
            risks).  This is further described in <xref target="Security" format="default"/>.  A relevant function is described in
            <xref target="IEEE-1609.3" format="default"/>
            and <xref target="IEEE-1609.4" format="default"/>.

      <t>
        The networks defined by 802.11-OCB are in many ways similar to
        other networks of the 802.11 family. In theory, the
        transportation of IPv6 over 802.11-OCB could be very similar to
        the operation of IPv6 over other networks of the 802.11
        family.  However, the high mobility, strong link asymmetry, and
        very short connection makes the 802.11-OCB link significantly
        different from other 802.11 networks. Also, automotive
        applications have specific requirements for reliability,

        At the time of writing, this is the list of
        IEEE 802.11 messages that may be transmitted in OCB mode,
        i.e., when dot11OCBActivated is true in a STA:

      <t>
	This section describes an example of an IPv6 packet captured
	over an IEEE 802.11-OCB link.
      </t>
      <t>
        By way of example, we show that there is no modification in the
        headers when transmitted over 802.11-OCB networks -- they are
        transmitted like any other 802.11 and Ethernet packets.
      </t>
      <t>
        We describe an experiment for capturing an IPv6 packet on an
        802.11-OCB link.  In the topology depicted in <xref target="topo" format="default"/>, the packet is an IPv6 Router Advertisement.
        This packet is emitted by a router on its 802.11-OCB
        interface.  The packet is captured on the host using a
        network protocol analyzer (e.g., Wireshark). The capture is
        performed in two different modes: direct mode and monitor
        mode.  The topology used during the capture is depicted below.
      </t>
      <t>
	The packet is captured on the host.  The host is an IP-OBU
	containing an 802.11 interface in Peripheral Component Interconnect
	(PCI) Express format (an Industrial Technology Research Institute
	(ITRI) product).  The kernel runs the ath5k software driver with
	modifications for OCB mode.  The capture tool is Wireshark.
	The file format for saving and analyzing is .pcap.  The packet is
	generated by the router, which is an IP-RSU (an ITRI
	product).

      <t>
        During several capture operations running from a few moments
        to several hours, no messages relevant to the BSSID contexts
        were captured (Association Request/Response, Authentication
        Req/Resp, or beacon).  This shows that the operation of
        802.11-OCB is outside the context of a BSSID.
      </t>
      <t>
        Overall, the captured message is identical to a capture of
        an IPv6 packet emitted on an 802.11b interface.  The contents
        are exactly the same.

        <name>Capture in Monitor Mode</name>
        <t>
          The IPv6 RA packet captured in monitor mode is illustrated
          below.  The Radiotap header provides more flexibility for
          reporting the characteristics of frames.  The Radiotap header
          is prepended by this particular stack and operating system on
          the host machine to the RA packet received from the network
          (the Radiotap header is not present on the air).  The
          implementation-dependent Radiotap header is useful for
          piggybacking PHY information from the chip's registers as data
          in a packet that is understandable by userland applications using
          socket interfaces (the PHY interface can be, for example,
          power levels, data rate, or the ratio of signal to noise).
        </t>
        <t>
          The packet present on the air is formed by the IEEE 802.11 Data
          header, Logical Link Control header, IPv6 Base header, and
          ICMPv6 header.

          The value of the Data Rate field in the Radiotap header is set
          to 6 Mb/s.  This indicates the rate at which this RA was
          received.

          The value of the Transmitter Address in the IEEE 802.11 Data
          header is set to a 48-bit value.  The value of the destination
          address is 33:33:00:00:00:1 (all-nodes multicast address).
          The value of the BSS ID field is ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, which is
          recognized by the network protocol analyzer as being
          "broadcast".  The Fragment number and Sequence number fields
          together are set to 0x90C6.
        </t>
        <t>
          The value of the Organization Code field in the
          Logical Link Control header is set to 0x0, recognized as
          "Encapsulated Ethernet".  The value of the Type field is
          0x86DD (hexadecimal 86DD; otherwise, #86DD), recognized
          as "IPv6".
        </t>
        <t>
          A Router Advertisement is periodically sent by the router to
          multicast group address ff02::1. It is ICMP packet type
          134. The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery's Router Advertisement
          message contains an 8-bit field reserved for single-bit flags,
          as described in <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The IPv6 header contains the link-local address of the router
          (source) configured via the EUI-64 algorithm, and the destination
          address is set to ff02::1.
        </t>

        <t>
          The Ethernet Type field in the Logical Link Control header
          is set to 0x86dd, which indicates that the frame transports
          an IPv6 packet. In the IEEE 802.11 data, the destination
          address is 33:33:00:00:00:01, which is the corresponding
          multicast MAC address. The BSS ID is a broadcast address of
          ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. Due to the short link duration between
          vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, there is no need in IEEE 802.11-OCB
	  to wait for the completion of association
          and authentication procedures before exchanging data. IEEE
          802.11-OCB enabled nodes use the wildcard BSSID (a value of
          all 1s) and may start communicating as soon as they arrive
          on the communication channel.

          One notices that the Radiotap header, the IEEE 802.11 Data
          header, and the Logical Link Control headers are not present.
          On the other hand, a new header named the Ethernet II header is
          present.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Destination and Source addresses in the Ethernet II header
          contain the same values as the Receiver Address and
          Transmitter Address fields present in the IEEE 802.11 Data header in
          the monitor mode capture.
        </t>
        <t>
          The value of the Type field in the Ethernet II header is
          0x86DD (recognized as "IPv6"); this value is the same as
          the value of the Type field in the Logical Link Control header
          in the monitor mode capture.
        </t>
        <t>
          The knowledgeable experimenter will no doubt notice the
          similarity of this Ethernet II header with a capture in normal
          mode on a pure Ethernet cable interface.
        </t>
        <t>
          A frame translation is inserted on top of a pure IEEE 802.11
          MAC layer in order to adapt packets before delivering the
          payload data to the applications.  It adapts 802.11 LLC/MAC
          headers to Ethernet II headers.  Specifically, this
          adaptation consists of the elimination of the Radiotap,
          802.11, and LLC headers and the insertion of the Ethernet
          II header.  In this way, IPv6 runs straight over LLC over
          the 802.11-OCB MAC layer; this is further confirmed by the
          use of the unique Type 0x86DD.

<dt>DSRCS (Dedicated Short-Range Communications Services):</dt><dd>
   Radio techniques are used to transfer data over short distances between
   roadside and mobile units, between mobile units, and between portable and
   mobile units to perform operations related to the improvement of traffic
   flow, traffic safety, and other intelligent transportation service
   applications in a variety of environments. DSRCS systems may also transmit status and
	instructional messages related to the units involved. <xref
	target="CFR-90.7"/></dd>

<dt>OBU (On-Board Unit):</dt><dd>An
	On-Board Unit is a DSRCS transceiver that is normally mounted
	in or on a vehicle or may be a portable unit in some instances.  An OBU can be operational while a vehicle or
	person is either mobile or stationary.  The OBUs receive and
	contend for time to transmit on one or more radio frequency
	(RF) channels.  Except where specifically excluded, OBU
	operation is permitted wherever vehicle operation or human
	passage is permitted.  The OBUs mounted in vehicles are
	licensed by rule under part 95 of <xref target="CFR-95"/> and
	communicate with Roadside Units (RSUs) and other OBUs.
	Portable OBUs are also licensed by rule under part 95 of <xref
	target="CFR-95"/>.  OBU operations in the Unlicensed National
	Information Infrastructure (U-NII) Bands follow the rules in
	those bands. <xref target="CFR-90.7"/>
      </dd>

<dt>RSU (Roadside Unit):</dt><dd>A
	Roadside Unit is a DSRC transceiver that is mounted along a
	road or pedestrian passageway.  An RSU may also be mounted on
	a vehicle or may be hand carried, but it may only operate when the
	vehicle or hand-carried unit is stationary. Perhaps
        Furthermore, an RSU is restricted to the location where it is licensed
	to operate. However, portable
	or handheld RSUs are permitted to operate where they do not
	interfere with a site-licensed operation.  An RSU broadcasts
	data to OBUs or exchanges data with OBUs in its communications
	zone.  An RSU also provides channel assignments and operating
	instructions to OBUs in its communications zone when
	required. <xref target="CFR-90.7"/>

      <name>Neighbor Discovery (ND) Potential Issues in Wireless Links</name>
      <t>
	IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) <xref target="RFC4861"/> <xref target="RFC4862"/> was
	designed for point-to-point and transit links, such as
	Ethernet, with the expectation of cheap and reliable support
	for multicast from the lower layer. <xref target="RFC4861"
	section="3.2" sectionFormat="of"/> indicates that the operation on shared media and on
	NBMA networks require additional
	support, e.g., for AR and DAD, which depend on multicast. An
	infrastructureless radio network such as OCB shares properties
	with both shared media and NBMA networks and then adds its
	own complexity, e.g., from movement and interference that
	allow only transient and non-transitive reachability between
	any set of peers.
      </t>

      <t>
	The uniqueness of an address within a scoped domain is a key
	pillar of IPv6 and is the basis for unicast IP communication. <xref
	target="RFC4861"/> details the DAD method to prevent an address from
	being duplicated. For a link-local address, the scope is the link,
	whereas for a globally reachable address, the scope is much
	larger.  The underlying assumption for DAD to operate
	correctly is that the node that owns an IPv6 address can reach
	any other node within the scope at the time it claims its
	address, which is done by sending a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) multicast message, and
	can hear any future claim for that address by another party
	within the scope for the duration of the address ownership.
      </t>

      <t>
   In the case of OCB, there is a potentially a need to define a scope that is
   compatible with DAD. The scope cannot be the set of nodes that a transmitter
   can reach at a particular time because that set varies all the time and
   does not meet the DAD requirements for a link-local address that can be
   used anytime and anywhere. The generic expectation of a reliable
	multicast is not ensured, and the operation of DAD and AR
	as specified by <xref target="RFC4861"/> cannot be
	guaranteed.  Moreover, multicast transmissions that rely on
	broadcast are not only unreliable but are also often
	detrimental to unicast traffic (see <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-mboned-ieee802-mcast-problems" format="default"/>).
      </t>
      <t>
	Early experience indicates that it should be possible to
	exchange IPv6 packets over OCB while relying on IPv6 ND alone
	for DAD and AR (Address Resolution) in good conditions. In the absence
	of a correct DAD operation, a node that relies only on IPv6 ND
	for AR and DAD over OCB should ensure that the addresses that
	it uses are unique by means other than DAD. It must be noted
	that deriving an IPv6 address from a globally unique MAC
	address has this property but may yield privacy issues.
      </t>
      <t>
	<xref target="RFC8505"/> provides a more recent approach to IPv6 ND, in
	particular DAD. <xref target="RFC8505"/> is designed to fit wireless and
	otherwise constrained networks whereby multicast and/or
	continuous access to the medium may not be guaranteed. <xref
	target="RFC8505" sectionFormat="comma" section="5.6"/> ("Link-Local Addresses and Registration")
	indicates that the scope of uniqueness for a link-local
	address is restricted to a pair of nodes that uses it to
	communicate and provides a method to assert the uniqueness
	and resolve the link-layer address using a unicast exchange.
      </t>
      <t>
	<xref target="RFC8505"/> also enables a router (acting as a 6LR) to own a
	prefix and act as a registrar (acting as a 6LBR) for addresses
	within the associated subnet. A peer host (acting as a 6LN)
	registers an address derived from that prefix and can use it
	for the lifetime of the registration. The prefix is advertised
	as not on-link, which means that the 6LN uses the 6LR to relay
	its packets within the subnet, and participation to the subnet
	is constrained to the time of reachability to the 6LR. Note
	that an RSU that provides internet connectivity <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> announce a
	default router preference <xref target="RFC4191" format="default"/>, whereas a car that does
	not provide that connectivity <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> do so. This operation
	presents similarities to that of an access point, but at
	Layer 3. This is why <xref target="RFC8505"/> is well suited for wireless in
	general.
      </t>
      <t>
	Support of <xref target="RFC8505"/> may be implemented on OCB. OCB nodes
	that support <xref target="RFC8505"/> <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> support the 6LN operation in order
	to act as a host and may support the 6LR and 6LBR operations
	in order to act as a router and in particular to own a prefix
	that can be used by hosts that are compliant with <xref target="RFC8505"/> for address
	autoconfiguration and registration.
