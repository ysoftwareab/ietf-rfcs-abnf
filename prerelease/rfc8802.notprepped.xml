      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
   The World Wide Web (WWW) is a distributed hypermedia system
   that has gained widespread acceptance among Internet users.
   Although WWW browsers support other, preexisting Internet
   application protocols, the primary protocol used between WWW
   clients and servers became the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   (<xref target="RFC7230" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC7231" format="default"/>, 
    <xref target="RFC7232" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC7233" format="default"/>, 
    <xref target="RFC7234" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC7235" format="default"/>).  
   Since then, HTTP over TLS (known as HTTPS
   and described in <xref target="RFC2818" format="default"/>) has become an imperative for
   providing secure and authenticated WWW access.  The mechanisms
   described in this document are equally applicable to HTTP and
   HTTPS.</t>
      <t>
   The ease of use of the Web has prompted its widespread employment
   as a client/server architecture for many applications.  Many of
   such applications require the client and the server to be able to
   communicate with each other and exchange information with certain
   quality constraints.</t>
      <t>
   Quality in communications at the application level consists of
   four measurable parameters:

      </t>
      <dl newline="false" spacing="normal" indent="6">
        <dt>Latency:</dt>
        <dd>The time a message takes to travel from source to
        destination. It may be approximated as RTT/2 (round-trip
        time), assuming the networks are symmetrical. In this context,
        we will consider the statistical median formula.</dd>
        <dt>Jitter:</dt>
        <dd>Latency variation. There are some formulas to
        calculate jitter, and in this context, we will consider the
        arithmetic mean formula.</dd>

	
        <dt>Bandwidth:</dt>
        <dd>Bit rate of communication. To ensure quality, a
        protocol must ensure the availability of the bandwidth needed
        by the application.</dd>
        <dt>Packet loss:</dt>
        <dd>The percentage of packet loss is closely related
        to bandwidth and jitter. Packet loss affects bandwidth because a high
        packet loss sometimes implies retransmissions that also
        consumes extra bandwidth, other times the retransmissions are
        not achieved (for example, in video streaming over UDP), and
        the information received is less than the required bandwidth.
        In terms of jitter, a packet loss sometimes is seen by the
        destination as a larger time between arrivals, causing a
        jitter growth.</dd>
      </dl>
      <t>
   Any other communication parameter, such as throughput, is not a
   network parameter because it depends on protocol window size and
   other implementation-dependent aspects.</t>
      <t>
   The Q4S protocol provides a mechanism for
   quality monitoring based on an HTTP syntax and the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) in order to be easily integrated in the
   WWW, but it may be used by any type of application, not only those
   based on HTTP. Quality requirements may be needed by any type of
   application that communicates using any kind of protocol,
   especially those with real-time constraints. Depending on the
   nature of each application, the constraints may be different,
   leading to different parameter thresholds that need to be met.</t>
      <t>
   Q4S is an application-level client/server protocol that
   continuously measures session quality for a given flow (or set of
   flows), end-to-end (e2e) and in real time; raising alerts if
   quality parameters are below a given negotiated threshold and
   sending recoveries when quality parameters are restored. Q4S
   describes when these notifications, alerts, and recoveries need to
   be sent and the entity receiving them. The actions undertaken by
   the receiver of the alert are out of scope of the protocol.</t>
      <t>
   Q4S is session-independent from the application flows to minimize
   the impact on them. To perform the measurements, two control flows
   are created on both communication paths (forward and reverse
   directions).</t>
      <t>
   This protocol specification is the product of research conducted
   over a number of years and is presented here as a permanent
   record and to offer a foundation for future similar work.  It does
   not represent a standard protocol and does not have IETF
   consensus.</t>
      <section anchor="sec-1.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Scope</name>
        <t>
   The purpose of Q4S is to measure end-to-end network quality in
   real time. Q4S does not transport any application data. This means
   that Q4S is designed to be used jointly with other transport
   protocols such as Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref target="RFC3550" format="default"/>,
   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <xref target="RFC0793" format="default"/>, 
   QUIC <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport" format="default"/>, 
   HTTP <xref target="RFC7230" format="default"/>, etc.</t>
        <t>
   Some existent transport protocols are focused on real-time media
   transport and certain connection metrics are available, which is
   the case of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) <xref target="RFC3550" format="default"/>. Other
   protocols such as QUIC provide low connection latencies as well as
   advanced congestion control. These protocols transport data
   efficiently and provide a lot of functionalities. However, there are
   currently no other quality measurement protocols offering the same
   level of function as Q4S.  See <xref target="sec-1.4" format="default"/> for a discussion of the
   IETF's quality measurement protocols, One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and 
   Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP).</t>
        <t>
   Q4S enables applications to become reactive under e2e network
   quality changes. To achieve it, an independent Q4S stack
   application must run in parallel with the target application. Then, Q4S
   metrics may be used to trigger actions on the target application, such
   as speed adaptation to latency in multiuser games, bitrate control
   at streaming services, intelligent commutation of delivery node at
   Content Delivery Networks, and whatever the target application allows.</t>

        <name>Motivation</name>
        <t>
   Monitoring quality of service (QoS) in computer networks is useful
   for several reasons:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>It enables real-time services and applications to verify whether
        network resources achieve a certain QoS level. This helps
        real-time services and applications to run over the
        Internet, allowing the existence of Application Content
        Providers (ACPs), which offer guaranteed real-time services to
        the end users.</li>
          <li>Real-time monitoring allows applications to adapt themselves
        to network conditions (application-based QoS) and/or request
        more network quality from the Internet Service Provider (ISP)
        (if the ISP offers this possibility).</li>
          <li>Monitoring may also be required by peer-to-peer (P2P) real-time 
           applications for which Q4S can be used.</li>
          <li>Monitoring enables ISPs to offer QoS to any ACP or end user application
        in an accountable way.</li>
          <li>
            <t>Monitoring enables e2e negotiation of QoS parameters, independently of
        the ISPs of both endpoints.</t>
           </li>
</ul>
            <t>

        A protocol to monitor QoS must address the following issues:

            </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Must be ready to be used in conjunction with current standard
        protocols and applications, without forcing a change on them.</li>
          <li>Must have a formal and compact way to specify quality
        constraints desired by the application to run.</li>
          <li>Must have measurement mechanisms that avoid application
        disruption and minimize network resources consumption.</li>
          <li>Must have specific messages to alert about the violation of
        quality constraints in different directions (forward and
        reverse) because network routing may not be symmetrical, and
        of course, quality constraints may not be symmetrical.</li>
          <li>After having alerted about the violation of quality
        constraints, must have specific messages to inform about
        the recovery of quality constraints in corresponding directions
        (forward and reverse).</li>
          <li>Must protect the data (constraints, measurements, QoS levels
        demanded from the network) in order to avoid the injection of
        malicious data in the measurements.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <name>Summary of Features</name>
        <t>
   The Quality for Service (Q4S) protocol is a message-oriented
   communication protocol that can be used in conjunction with any
   other application-level protocol. Q4S is a measurement protocol.
   Any action taken derived from its measurements are out of scope of
   the protocol. These actions depend on the application provider and may
   be application-level adaptive reactions, may involve requests to
   the ISP, or whatever the application provider decides.</t>
        <t>
   The benefits in quality measurements provided by Q4S can be used
   by any type of application that uses any type of protocol for data
   transport. It provides a quality monitoring scheme for any
   communication that takes place between the client and the server,
   not only for the Q4S communication itself.</t>
        <t>
   Q4S does not establish multimedia sessions, and it does not
   transport application data. It monitors the fulfillment of the
   quality requirements of the communication between the client and
   the server; therefore, it does not impose any restrictions on the
   type of application, protocol, or usage of the
   monitored quality connection.</t>
        <t>
   Some applications may vary their quality requirements dynamically
   for any given quality parameter. Q4S is able to adapt to the
   changing application needs, modifying the parameter thresholds to
   the new values and monitoring the network quality according to the
   new quality constraints. It will raise alerts if the new
   constraints are violated.</t>
        <t>
   The Q4S session lifetime is composed of four phases with different
   purposes: Handshake, Negotiation, Continuity, and Termination.
   Negotiation and Continuity phases perform network parameter
   measurements per a negotiated measurement procedure. Different
   measurement procedures could be used inside Q4S, although one
   default measurement mechanism is needed for compatibility reasons
   and is the one defined in this document. Basically, Q4S defines
   how to transport application quality requirements and measurement
   results between a client and server and how to provide monitoring and
   alerting, too.</t>
        <t>
   Q4S must be executed just before starting a client-server
   application that needs a quality connection in terms of latency,
   jitter, bandwidth, and/or packet loss. Once the client and server have
   succeeded in establishing communication under quality constraints,
   the application can start, and Q4S continues measuring and
   alerting if necessary.</t>
        <t>
   The quality parameters can be suggested by the client in the first
   message of the Handshake phase, but it is the server that accepts
   these parameter values or forces others. The server is in charge
   of deciding the final values of quality connection.</t>

        <name>Differences from OWAMP/TWAMP</name>
        <t>
   OWAMP <xref target="RFC4656" format="default"/> and 
   TWAMP <xref target="RFC5357" format="default"/> are two protocols
   to measure network quality in terms of RTT, but they have a different
   goal than Q4S. The main difference is the scope: Q4S is designed
   to assist reactive applications, whereas OWAMP/TWAMP is designed
   to measure just network delay.</t>
        <t>
   The differences can be summarized in the following points:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>OWAMP and TWAMP are not intended for measuring availability of
      resources (certain bandwidth availability, for example) but
      only RTT. However, Q4S is intended for measuring required
      bandwidth, packet loss, jitter, and latency in both
      directions. Available bandwidth is not measured by Q4S, but
      bandwidth required for a specific application is.</li>
          <li>OWAMP and TWAMP do not have responsivity control (which
      defines the speed of protocol reactions under network quality
      changes) because these protocols are designed to measure
      network performance, not to assist reactive applications, and
      do not detect the fluctuations of quality within certain time
      intervals to take reactive actions. However, responsivity
      control is a key feature of Q4S.</li>
          <li>OWAMP and TWAMP are not intended to run in parallel with reactive
      applications, but the Q4S protocol's goal is to run in parallel and assist
      reactive applications in making decisions based on Q4S-ALERT
      packets, which may trigger actions.</li>

      <name>Overview of Operation</name>
      <t>
   This section introduces the basic operation of Q4S using simple
   examples.  This section is of a tutorial nature and does not contain
   any normative statements.</t>
      <t>
   The first example shows the basic functions of Q4S:
   communication establishment between a client and a server, quality
   requirement negotiations for the requested application,
   application start and continuous quality parameter measurements,
   and finally communication termination.</t>
      <t>
   The client triggers the establishment of the communication by
   requesting a specific service or application from the server. This
   first message must have a special URI <xref target="RFC3986" format="default"/>, which may
   force the use of the Q4S protocol if it is implemented in a
   standard web browser. This message consists of a Q4S BEGIN method,
   which can optionally include a proposal for the communication
   quality requirements in an SDP body. This option gives the client
   a certain negotiation capacity about quality requirements, but it
   will be the server who finally decides the stated
   requirements.</t>
      <t>
   This request is answered by the server with a Q4S 200 OK response
   letting the client know that it accepts the request. This response
   message must contain an SDP body with the following:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The assigned Q4S sess-id.</li>
        <li>The quality constraints required by the requested application.</li>
        <li>The measurement procedure to use.</li>
        <li>
          <t>"alerting-mode" attribute: There are two different scenarios for
      sending alerts that trigger actions either on the network or
      in the application when measurements identify violated
      quality constraints. In both cases, alerts are triggered by
      the server.
          </t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="(%c)">
            <li> 
              <t>Q4S-aware-network scenario: The network is Q4S aware
           and reacts by itself to these alerts. In this scenario,
           Q4S-ALERT messages are sent by the server to the client,
           and network elements inspect and process these alert
           messages. The alerting mode in this scenario is called
           Q4S-aware-network alerting mode.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Reactive scenario: As shown in 
           <xref target="ref-reactive-scenario" format="default"/>, the network
           is not Q4S aware. In this scenario, alert notifications
           are sent to a specific node, called an Actuator, which is
           in charge of making decisions regarding what actions to
           trigger: either to change application behavior to adapt
           it to network conditions and/or invoke a network policy
           server in order to reconfigure the network and request
           better quality for application flows.</t>

        <t>The format of messages exchanged between the server stack and
      the Actuator doesn't follow Q4S codification rules;
      their format will be implementation dependent. In this way,
      we will call the messages sent from the server stack to the
      Actuator "notifications" (e.g., alert notifications) and the
      messages sent from the Actuator to the server stack in
      response to notifications "acknowledges" (e.g., alert
      acknowledges).</t>
        </li>
      </ol></li>
</ul>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>"alert-pause" attribute: The amount of time between consecutive alerts.
      In the Q4S-aware-network scenario, the server has to wait
      this period of time between Q4S-ALERT messages sent to the
      client. In the Reactive scenario, the server stack has to
      wait this period of time between alert notifications sent to
      the Actuator. Measurements are not stopped in Negotiation or
      Continuity phases during this period of time, but no alerts
      are sent, even with violated network quality constraints, in
      order to leave time for network reconfiguration or for
      application adjustments.</li>
        <li>"recovery-pause" attribute: The amount of time the Q4S server waits
      before trying to recover the initial "qos-level" (<xref target="sec-7.2.1" format="default"/>). 
      After having
      detected violation of quality constraints several times, the
      "qos-level" will have been increased accordingly. If this
      violation detection finally stops, the server waits for a
      period of time (recovery time), and if the situation persists,
      it tries to recover to previous "qos-level" values gradually by
      sending Q4S-RECOVERY messages to the client in the Q4S-aware-network scenario, or recovery notifications to the
      Actuator in the Reactive scenario (<xref target="sec-7.9" format="default"/>).</li>
      </ul>
      <t>
   It is important to highlight that any Q4S 200 OK response sent by
   the server to the client at any time during the life of a quality
   session may contain an SDP body with new values of quality
   constraints required by the application. Depending on the phase
   and the state of the measurement procedure within the specific
   phase, the client will react accordingly to take into
   account the new quality constraints in the measurement procedure.</t>
      <t>
   Once the communication has been established (i.e., the Handshake phase is
   finished), the protocol will verify that the communication path
   between the client and the server meets the quality constraints in
   both directions, from and to the server (Negotiation phase). This
   Negotiation phase requires taking measurements of the quality
   parameters: latencies, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss. This
   phase is initiated with a client message containing a Q4S READY
   method, which will be answered by the server with a Q4S 200 OK
   response.</t>
      <t>
   Negotiation measurements are achieved in two sequential stages:
      </t>
      <dl newline="false" spacing="normal" indent="6">
        <dt>Stage 0:</dt>
        <dd> latency and jitter measurements</dd>
        <dt>Stage 1:</dt>
        <dd> bandwidth and packet loss measurements</dd>
      </dl>
      <t>
   Stage 0 measurements are taken through Q4S PING messages
   sent from both the client and the server. All Q4S PING
   requests will be answered by Q4S 200 OK messages to allow for
   bidirectional measurements.</t>
      <t>
   Different client and server implementations may send a different
   number of PING messages for measuring, although at least 255
   messages should be considered to perform the latency measurement.
   The Stage 0 measurements only may be considered ended when neither
   client nor server receive new PING messages after an
   implementation-dependent guard time. Only after Stage 0 has ended, can the client send a
   "READY 1" message.</t>
      <t>
   After a pre-agreed number of measurements have been performed,
   determined by the measurement procedure sent by the server, three
   scenarios may be possible:
      </t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="(%c)">
        <li> Measurements do not meet the 
        requirements: in this case, the
	stage 0 is repeated after sending an alert from the server to
      the client or from the server stack to the Actuator, depending
      on the alerting mode defined in the Handshake phase. Notice
      that measurements continue to be taken but no alerts are sent
      during the "alert-pause" time. In the Reactive scenario, the
      Actuator will decide either to forward the alert notification
      to the network policy server or to the application, depending
      on where reconfiguration actions have to be taken.
	</li>
        <li> Measurements do meet the requirements: in this case, client
	moves to stage 1 by sending a new READY message.
	</li>
        <li> At any time during the measurement procedure, the Q4S 200 OK
	message sent by the server to the client, in response to a Q4S
      PING message, contains an SDP body with new values of quality
      constraints required by the application. This means the
      application has varied their quality requirements dynamically;
      therefore, quality thresholds used while monitoring quality
      parameters have to be changed to the new constraints. In this
      case, the client moves to the beginning of Stage 0 for
      initiating the negotiation measurements again.
	</li>
      </ol>
      <t>
   Stage 1 is optional. Its purpose is to measure the availability of
   application-needed bandwidth. If the "bandwidth" attribute is 
   set to zero kbps in the SDP, the client can skip stage 1 by 
   sending a "READY 2" message after completion of stage 0. Stage 1
   measurements are achieved through Q4S BWIDTH messages sent
   from both the client and the server. Unlike PING messages, Q4S BWIDTH
   requests will not be answered.</t>
      <t>
   If Stage 0 and 1 meet the application quality constraints, the
   application may start. Q4S will enter the Continuity phase
   by measuring the network quality parameters through the Q4S PING
   message exchange on both connection paths and raising alerts in
   case of violation.</t>
      <t>
   Once the client wants to terminate the quality session, it sends a
   Q4S CANCEL message, which will be acknowledged by the server with
   another Q4S CANCEL message. Termination of quality sessions are
   always initiated by the client because Q4S TCP requests follow the
   client/server schema.</t>
        <t><xref target="ref-successful-q4s-message-exchange" format="default"/> 
   depicts the message exchange in a successful scenario.</t>

   The following two examples show the behavior of the Q4S protocol

   In this Q4S-aware-network alerting mode scenario, the server may
   send Q4S alerts to the client at any time upon detection of violated
   quality constraints. This alerting exchange must not interrupt the
   continuity quality parameter measurements between client and
   server.</t>
   <t>
   The second example depicted in <xref target="ref-reactive-alerting-mode" format="default"/> represents the
   Reactive scenario, in which alert notifications are sent from the
   server stack to the Actuator, which is in charge of deciding 
   to act over application behavior and/or to invoke a network policy
   server. The Actuator is an entity that has a defined set of
   different quality levels and decides how to act depending on the
   actions stated for each of these levels; it can take actions for
   making adjustments on the application, or it can send a request to
   the policy server for acting on the network. The policy server
   also has a defined set of different quality levels previously agreed
   upon between the Application Content Provider and the ISP. The
   Reactive alerting mode is the default mode.</t>

      <t>
   At the end of any stage of the Negotiation phase, the server sends an
   alert notification to the Actuator if quality constraints are
   violated. During the period of time defined by the "alert-pause"
   attribute, no further alert notifications are sent, but
   measurements are not interrupted. This way, both the client and
   the server will detect network improvements as soon as possible.
   In a similar way during the Continuity phase, the server may send
   alert notifications at any time to the Actuator upon detection of
   violated quality constraints. This alerting exchange must not
   interrupt the continuity measurements between client and server.</t>
      <t>
   Finally, in the Termination phase, Q4S CANCEL messages sent from
   the client to the server must be forwarded from the server to the
   Actuator in order to release possible assigned resources for the
   session.</t>

      <name>Q4S Messages</name>
      <t>
   Q4S is a text-based protocol and uses the UTF-8 charset 
   <xref target="RFC3629" format="default"/>. A Q4S message is either a request or a response.</t>
      <t>
   Both request and response messages use the basic format of
   Internet Message Format <xref target="RFC5322" format="default"/>. Both types of messages
   consist of a start-line, one or more header fields, an empty line
   indicating the end of the header fields, and an optional message-body.
   This document uses ABNF notation <xref target="RFC5234" format="default"/>
   for the definitions of the syntax of messages.</t>
      <t>
   The start-line, each message-header line, and the empty line <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
   be terminated by a carriage-return line-feed sequence (CRLF).
   Note that the empty line <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present even if the message-body
   is not.</t>
      <sourcecode type="abnf"><![CDATA[

]]></sourcecode>
      <t>
   Much of Q4S's messages and header field syntax are identical to
   HTTP/1.1. However, Q4S is not an extension of HTTP.</t>
      <section anchor="sec-4.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Requests</name>
        <t>
   Q4S requests are distinguished by having a Request-Line for a
   start-line. A Request-Line contains a method name, a Request-URI,
   and the protocol version separated by a single space (SP)
   character.</t>
        <t>
   The Request-Line ends with CRLF. No CR or LF are allowed except in
   the end-of-line CRLF sequence. No linear whitespace (LWSP) is allowed
   in any of the elements.</t>

          <dd>
	This specification defines seven methods: BEGIN for
	starting and negotiating quality sessions, READY for
      synchronization of measurements, PING and BWIDTH for
      quality measurements purposes, CANCEL for terminating
      sessions, Q4S-ALERT for reporting quality violations, and
      Q4S-RECOVERY for reporting quality recovery.

          <dt>Request-URI:</dt>
          <dd>
	The Request-URI is a Q4S URI <xref target="RFC3986" format="default"/> as described
	in <xref target="sec-7.4" format="default"/>. The Request-URI <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> contain unescaped spaces
      or control characters and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be enclosed in "&lt;&gt;".

          <dt>Q4S-Version:</dt>
          <dd>
	Both request and response messages include the

      specification, applications sending Q4S messages <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
      include a Q4S-Version of "Q4S/1.0".  The Q4S-Version string
      is case insensitive, but implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> 
      send uppercase. Unlike HTTP/1.1, Q4S treats the version number as a
      literal string.  In practice, this should make no difference.

      <section anchor="sec-4.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Responses</name>
        <t>
   Q4S responses are distinguished from requests by having a Status-Line as their start-line. A Status-Line consists of the protocol
   version followed by a numeric Status-Code and its associated
   textual phrase, with each element separated by a single SP
   character. No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF
   sequence.</t>
        <sourcecode type="abnf"><![CDATA[
   Status-Line  =  Q4S-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF 
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>
   The Status-Code is a 3-digit integer result code that indicates
   the outcome of an attempt to understand and satisfy a request. The
   Reason-Phrase is intended to give a short textual description of
   the Status-Code.  The Status-Code is intended for use by automata,
   whereas the Reason-Phrase is intended for the human user. A client
   is not required to examine or display the Reason-Phrase.</t>
        <t>
   While this specification suggests specific wording for the 
   Reason-Phrase, implementations <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> choose other text, for example, in the
   language indicated in the Accept-Language header field of the
   request.</t>
        <t>
   The first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response.
   The last two digits do not have any categorization role.  For this
   reason, any response with a status code between 100 and 199 is
   referred to as a "1xx response", any response with a status code
   between 200 and 299 as a "2xx response", and so on.  Q4S/1.0
   allows following values for the first digit:

        </t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal" indent="6">
          <dt>1xx:</dt>
          <dd>
	Provisional -- request received, continuing to process the request;
	</dd>
          <dt>2xx:</dt>
          <dd>
	Success -- the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted;
	</dd>
          <dt>3xx:</dt>
          <dd>
	Redirection -- further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request;
	</dd>
          <dt>4xx:</dt>
          <dd>
	Request Failure -- the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled at this server;
	</dd>
          <dt>5xx:</dt>
          <dd> 
        Server Error -- the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request;
	</dd>
          <dt>6xx:</dt>
          <dd> 
        Global Failure -- the request cannot be fulfilled at any server.
	</dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
   The status codes are the same as described in HTTP <xref target="RFC7231" format="default"/>. In
   the same way as HTTP, Q4S applications are not required to
   understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
   understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
   understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first
   digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to
   the x00 status code of that class.</t>
        <t>
   The Q4S-ALERT, Q4S-RECOVERY, and CANCEL requests do not have to be
   responded to. However, after receiving a Q4S-ALERT, Q4S-RECOVERY, or
   CANCEL request, the server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send a Q4S-ALERT, Q4S-RECOVERY,
   or CANCEL request to the client.</t>

   Q4S header fields are identical to HTTP header fields in both
   syntax and semantics.</t>
        <t>
   Some header fields only make sense in requests or responses. These
   are called request header fields and response header fields,
   respectively.  If a header field appears in a message that does not match
   its category (such as a request header field in a response), it
   <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored.</t>

      header field. If a message has an SDP body, this header field is
      optional. The method of sess-id allocation is up to the

      pre-agreed security policies between the Application Content

   Requests, including new requests defined in extensions to this

   The interpretation of the body depends on the request method.</t>
        <t>
   For response messages, the request method and the response status
   code determine the type and interpretation of any message body.
   All responses <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include a body.</t>
        <t>
   The Internet media type of the message body <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be given by the

   The body <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be compressed. This mechanism is valid for
   other protocols such as HTTP and SIP <xref target="RFC3261" format="default"/>, 
   but a compression/coding scheme will limit the way the request 
   is parsed to certain logical implementations, thus making
   the protocol concept more implementation dependent. In addition, the
   bandwidth calculation may not be valid if compression is used.
   Therefore, the HTTP Accept-Encoding request header field cannot be
   used in Q4S with values different from "identity", and if it is
   present in a request, the server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore it. In addition, the
   response header field Content-Encoding is optional, but if present,
   the unique permitted value is "identity".</t>
          <t>
   The body length in bytes <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be provided by the Content-Length
   header field. The "chunked" transfer encoding of HTTP/1.1 <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
   be used for Q4S.</t>

   The response to a Q4S-ALERT request is not cacheable.</t>
        <t>
   This method <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be initiated by the server in both alerting
   modes. In the Q4S-aware-network alerting mode, the Q4S-ALERT messages
   are sent by the server to the client, advising the
   network to react by itself. In the Reactive alerting mode, alert
   notifications are triggered by the server stack and sent to the
   Actuator (see <xref target="ref-reactive-scenario" format="default"/>, "Reactive Scenario").</t>

   This is the request message that Q4S generates when the

   have been fulfilled during a period of time
   ("recovery-pause"). It is used during the Negotiation and Continuity
   phases.</t>
        <t>
   This informative message indicates that the "qos-level" could be
   increased gradually until the initial "qos-level" is recovered (the
   "qos-level" established at the beginning of the session that was
   decreased during violation of constraints. See <xref target="sec-7.9" format="default"/>). 
   The Q4S-RECOVERY
   message does not contain any detail on the actions to be taken,
   which depends on the agreements between all involved parties.</t>
        <t>
   The answer to a Q4S-RECOVERY request is formatted as a request
   Q4S-RECOVERY message. A Q4S-RECOVERY request <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be answered 
   with a response message unless there is an error condition. 
   The response to a Q4S-RECOVERY request is not cacheable.</t>
        <t>
   Like the Q4S-ALERT message, the Q4S-RECOVERY method is always
   initiated by the server in both alerting modes. In the 
   Q4S-aware-network alerting mode, the Q4S-RECOVERY messages are sent by the
   server to the client, advising the network to react by
   itself. In the Reactive alerting mode, recovery notifications are
   triggered by the server stack and sent to the Actuator (see <xref target="ref-reactive-scenario" format="default"/>, 
   "Reactive Scenario").</t>

      <section anchor="sec-5.7" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>CANCEL</name>
        <t>
   The purpose of the CANCEL message is the release of the Q4S 
   Session-Id and the possible resources assigned to the session. This
   message could be triggered by the Q4S stack or by the application
   using the stack (through an implementation-dependent API).</t>
        <t>
   In the same way as Q4S-ALERT, CANCEL must not be answered with a
   response message, but with an answer formatted as a request Q4S-CANCEL message.</t>
        <t>
   In the Reactive scenario, the server stack <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> react to the Q4S
   CANCEL messages received from the client by forwarding a cancel
   notification to the Actuator, in order to release possible
   assigned resources for the session (at the application or at the policy
   server). The Actuator <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> answer the cancel notification with a
   cancel acknowledge towards the server stack, acknowledging the
   reception.</t>

   Q4S response codes are used for TCP and UDP. However, in UDP, only

      <t>
   The receiver of an unknown response code must take a generic
   action for the received error group (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx,

   All elements of the IP network contribute to quality in
   terms of latency, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss. All these
   elements have their own quality policies in terms of priorities,
   traffic mode, etc., and each element has its own way to manage the
   quality. The purpose of a quality connection is to establish 
   end-to-end communication with enough quality for the application
   to function flawlessly.</t>
        <t>
   To monitor quality constraints of the application, four phases are
   defined and can be seen in <xref target="ref-session-lifetime-phases" format="default"/>:</t>

        <name>SDP Structure</name>
        <t>
   The original goal of SDP was to announce necessary information for
   the participants and multicast MBONE (Multicast Backbone)
   applications. Right now, its use has been extended to the
   announcement and the negotiation of multimedia sessions. The
   purpose of Q4S is not to establish media stream sessions, but to
   monitor a quality connection. This connection may be later used to
   establish any type of session including media sessions; Q4S does
   not impose any conditions on the type of communication requiring
   quality parameters.</t>
        <t>
   SDP will be used by Q4S to exchange quality constraints and will
   therefore always have all the media descriptions ("m=") set to zero.</t>
        <t>
   The SDP embedded in the messages is the container of the quality
   parameters. As these may vary depending on the direction of the
   communication (to and from the client), all quality parameters need
   to specify the uplink and downlink values: &lt;uplink&gt; / &lt;downlink&gt;
   (see <xref target="sec-7.5.3" format="default"/> for an example).
   When one or both of these values are empty, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be understood
   as needing no constraint on that parameter and/or that direction.</t>
        <t>
   The uplink direction <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be considered as being the communication
   from the client to the server. The downlink direction <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
   considered as being the communication from the server to the
   client.</t>
        <t>
   The SDP information can comprise all or some of the following
   parameters shown in the example below. This is an example of an
   SDP message used by Q4S included in the 200 OK response to a Q4S
   BEGIN request.</t>

   As quality constraints may be changed by applications at any time
   during the Q4S session lifetime, any Q4S 200 OK response sent by
   the server to the client in the Negotiation and Continuity phases
   could also include an SDP body with the new quality requirements
   stated by the applications from then on. Therefore, in response to
   any PING request sent by the client to the server, the server
   could send a Q4S 200 OK with an embedded SDP message that

   downlink communications.</t>
          <t>
   Several "flow" attributes can be defined. These flows identify the

   or UDP <xref target="RFC0768" format="default"/>) 
   with the range of ports that are going
   to be used by the application and, of course, by the Q4S protocol
   (for quality measurements). All defined flows ("app" and "q4s") will
   be considered within the same quality profile, which is determined
   by the "qos-level" attribute in each direction. This allows us to
   assume that measurements on "q4s" flows are the same as experienced by
   the application, which is using "app" flows.</t>
          <t>
   During Negotiation and Continuity phases, the specified Q4S ports

   The Q4S flows comprise two UDP flows and two TCP flows (one uplink

   consist of many flows, depending on its nature. The Handshake
   phase takes place through the Q4S Contact URI, using the standard

   The "clientListeningPort" is a port on which the client listens

   listening for incoming messages from the client. The origin port
   of server responses may be different than the "serverListeningPort"

   If "clientListeningPort" is zero ("a=flow:q4s clientListeningPort

   actual received port values on the server side in order to deal
   with NAT/NAPT devices. If a zero value or incorrect value is
   present, the server must set the value to the received origin port in
   the next message with SDP (200 OK, ALERT, and CANCEL messages).</t>

   These attributes contain the measurement procedure and the results
   of the quality measurements.</t>
          <t>
   Measurement parameters are included using the session attribute
   "measurement". The first measurement parameter is the procedure.
   Q4S provides a "default" procedure for measurements, but others
   like RTP/RTCP might be used and defined later. This document will
   only define and explain the "default" procedure.</t>
          <t>
   In the initial client request, a set of measurement procedures can
   be sent to the server for negotiation. One measurement procedure
   line <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be included in the SDP message for each proposed method.
   The server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> answer with only one line with the chosen
   procedure.</t>
          <t>
   For each procedure, a set of values of parameters separated by ","
   can be included in the same attribute line. The amount and type of
   parameters depends on the procedure type.</t>
          <t>
   In the following example, the "default" procedure type is chosen:</t>
          <sourcecode type="sdp"><![CDATA[
   a=measurement:procedure default(50/50,75/75,5000,40/80,100/256)
        ]]></sourcecode>
          <t>
   In the "default" procedure, the meaning of these parameters is
the following:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>The first parameter is the interval of time (in milliseconds)
      between PING requests during the Negotiation phase. Uplink
      and downlink values from the client's point of view are
      separated by "/". This allows different responsiveness
      values depending on the control resources used in each
      direction.</li>
            <li>The second parameter is the time interval (in milliseconds)
      between PING requests during the Continuity phase. Uplink and
      downlink values are separated by "/". This allows two
      different responsiveness values depending on the control
      resources used in each direction.</li>
            <li>The third parameter is the time interval to be used to
      measure bandwidth during the Negotiation phase.</li>
            <li>The fourth parameter indicates the window size for jitter and
      latency calculations. Uplink and downlink values are
      separated by "/".</li>
            <li>The fifth parameter indicates the window size for packet loss
      calculations. Uplink and downlink values are separated by
      "/".</li>
          </ul>
          <t>
   There are four more "measurement" attributes:</t>
          <sourcecode type="sdp"><![CDATA[
a=measurement:latency 45
a=measurement:jitter 3/12
a=measurement:bandwidth 200/9800
a=measurement:packetloss 0.00/1.00
]]></sourcecode>
          <t>
   The "measurement:latency", "measurement:jitter", "measurement:bandwidth", and "measurement:packetloss" 
   attributes contain the values measured for each of these quality
   parameters in uplink and downlink directions. Notice that latency
   is considered equal for uplink and downlink directions. Quality
   parameter values in these "measurement" attributes provide a
   snapshot of the quality reached and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only be 
   included in Q4S-ALERT messages in the SDP body such that they can be protected
   from malicious attacks as these alerts include a signature of the
   SDP body in the header. The rest of the messages will include the
   measured values in the Measurements header field.</t>
          <t>
   In the case of the "default" procedure, the valid values are as follows:</t>
          <sourcecode type="abnf"><![CDATA[
a=measurement:procedure default,[0..999]"/" [0..999]  "," [0..999]

          <t>
   The adaptation of measurement traffic to approximate the actual
   data streams' characteristics is convenient to accurately estimate
   the expected QoS for applications. Particularly, packet size can
   have a remarkable effect on bandwidth estimations. Moreover, this
   can produce problems depending on the MTU of the end hosts and
   links along the path.</t>
          <t>
   Therefore, the maximum content length <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be set in an attribute
   denoted as "max-content-length". Its value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be given in bytes
   and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include application, transport, network, or link layer
   headers, i.e., size of the content length at the application
   layer. If not set, the value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be 1000 bytes.</t>
          <t>
   Furthermore, this attribute <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used to communicate MTU limits

   This section describes the way quality parameters are measured as
   defined by the "default" procedure. Measurements <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be taken for
   any quality parameter with constraints, that is, specified in the
   SDP attributes with non-zero values. For absent attributes,
   measurements <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be omitted.</t>

          <name>Latency</name>
          <t>
   Latency measurements will be performed if the "latency" attribute
   and/or the "a=measurement:latency" attribute are present and have non-zero values.</t>
          <t>
   Q4S defines a PING method in order to exchange packets between the
   client and the server. Based on this PING exchange, the client and
   the server are able to calculate the round-trip time (RTT). The
   RTT is the sum of downlink latency (normally named "reverse latency") and uplink latency (normally named "forward latency").</t>
          <t>
   At least 255 samples of RTT <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be taken by the client and
   server. As the forward and reverse latencies are impossible to
   measure, the client and server will assume that both latencies are
   identical (symmetric network assumption). The latency will
   therefore be calculated as the statistical median value of all the
   RTT samples divided by 2.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sec-7.3.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Jitter</name>
          <t>
   Jitter measurements will be performed if the "jitter" attribute
   and/or the "a=measurement:jitter" attribute are present and have non-zero values.</t>
          <t>
   The jitter can be calculated independently by the client and by
   the server. The downlink jitter is calculated by the client taking
   into account the time interval between PING requests as defined by
   the "measurement:procedure" attribute in the first or second
   parameter depending on the Q4S protocol phase. The client and the
   server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send these PING requests at the specified intervals.
   The client measures the downlink jitter, whereas the server
   measures the uplink jitter. Note that PING responses are not taken
   into account when calculating jitter values.</t>
          <t>
   Every time a PING request is received by an endpoint 
   (either server or client), the corresponding jitter value is 
   updated with the statistical jitter value, which is 
   the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of elapsed times
   calculated on the first 255 packets received.
          </t>
          <t>
   Each endpoint sends a PING periodically with a fixed interval,
   and each value of "elapsed time" (ET) should be very close to this
   interval. If a PING message is lost, the ET value is
   doubled. Identifying lost PING messages, however, is not an issue
   because all PING messages are labeled with a Sequence-Number
   header field. Therefore, the receiver can discard this ET
   value.</t>
          <t>
   In order to have the first jitter sample, the receiver <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> wait
   until it receives 3 PING requests, because each ET is the time
   between two PINGs, and a jitter measurement needs at least two ET.</t>
          <t>
   The client measures the values of RTT and downlink jitter, and the
   server measures RTT and uplink jitter, but all measurements are
   shared with the counterpart by means of the Measurements header field of
   the PING message.</t>

   attribute and/or the "a=measurement:bandwidth" attribute is present
   and has non-zero values.</t>
          <t>
   In order to measure the available bandwidth, both the client and

   The goal of these measurements is not to identify the available
   bandwidth of the communication path, but to determine if the
   required bandwidth is available, meeting the application's
   constraints. Therefore, the requested bandwidth <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be measured
   sending only the highest bitrate required by the bandwidth
   attribute. This is illustrated in <xref target="ref-bandwidth-and-packet-loss-measurements" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>
   ALERTS are not expected during bandwidth measurement, but
   only at the end of the measurement time.</t>
          <t>
   When measuring bandwidth, all BWIDTH requests sent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be 1
   kilobyte in length (UDP payload length by default), they <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
   include a Sequence-Number header field with a sequential number starting
   at 0, and their content <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> consist of randomly generated values
   to minimize the effect of compression elements along the path. The
   Sequence-Number <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be incremented by 1 with each BWIDTH packet
   sent. If any measurement stage needs to be repeated, the sequence
   number <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> start at zero again. BWIDTH requests <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be
   answered. Examples:</t>

        <name>Negotiation Phase</name>
        <t>
   The Negotiation phase is in charge of measuring the quality
   parameters and verifying that the communication paths meet the
   required quality constraints in both directions as specified in
   the SDP body.</t>
        <t>
   The measured parameters will be compared with the quality
   constraints specified in the SDP body. If the quality session is
   compliant with all the quality constraints, the application can
   start.</t>
<t>If the quality constraints are not met, a higher quality
      service level will be demanded. Depending on the scenario,
      this quality upgrade will be managed as follows: </t>
        
     <dl>
     <dt>In the Q4S-aware-network scenario:</dt><dd>a Q4S-ALERT method will be triggered
      by the server to the client, and the client will answer with
      the same Q4S-ALERT method. After receiving the same Q4S-ALERT
      from the counterpart, no other alerts will be triggered by
      the server during the "alert-pause" period of time in order
      to allow the network to react, but measurements will continue
      to be taken to achieve early detection of improved network
      quality conditions and a fast application start.</dd>
          <dt>In the Reactive scenario:</dt><dd>an alert notification will be sent
      by the server stack to the Actuator, and the Actuator will
      answer with an alert acknowledgement. After receiving the
      alert acknowledgement from the Actuator, the server stack
      will not send other alert notifications during the "alert-pause" 
      period of time in order to allow the Actuator to
      react and trigger actions on the application or on the policy
      server, but measurements will continue to be taken to achieve
      early detection of improved network quality conditions and a
      fast application start.</dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
   In both scenarios stated above, if after several measurement
   cycles, the network constraints cannot be met, the quality session
   is terminated. Concretely when, under all possible actions taken by
   Actuator, the quality remains below requirements, the session must
   be terminated.</t>
        <t>
   The steps to be taken in this phase depend on the measurement
   procedure exchanged during the Handshake phase. This document only
   describes the "default" procedure, but others can be used, like
   RTP/RTCP <xref target="RFC3550" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>
   Measurements of latency and jitter are made by calculating the
   differences in the arrival times of packets and can be achieved with
   little bandwidth consumption. The bandwidth measurement, on the
   other hand, involves higher bandwidth consumption in both
   directions (uplink and downlink).</t>
        <t>
   To avoid wasting unnecessary network resources, these two types of
   measurements will be performed in two separate stages. If the
   required latencies and jitters cannot be reached, it makes no
   sense to waste network resources measuring bandwidth. In addition,
   if achieving the required latency and jitter thresholds implies
   upgrading the quality session level, the chance of obtaining
   compliant bandwidth measurements without retries is higher, saving
   network traffic again. Therefore, the "default" procedure
   determines that the measurements are taken in two stages:
        </t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal" indent="6">
          <dt>Stage 0:</dt>
          <dd> Measurement of latencies, jitters, and packet loss</dd>
          <dt>Stage 1:</dt>
          <dd> Measurement of bandwidths and packet loss</dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
   Notice that packet loss can be measured in both stages, as all
   messages exchanged include a Sequence-Number header field that allows
   for easy packet loss detection.</t>
        <t>
   The client starts the Negotiation phase by sending a READY request
   using the TCP Q4S ports defined in the SDP. This READY request
   includes a Stage header field that indicates the measurement stage.</t>
        <t>
   If either jitter, latency, or both are specified, the Negotiation
   phase begins with the measurement of latencies and jitters (stage
   0). If none of those attributes is specified, stage 0 is skipped.</t>

   The following is 
   an example of the PING request sent from the client
   and the server's response:</t>
          <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
Client Request:
=========================
       PING q4s://www.example.com Q4S/1.0
       Session-Id: 53655765
       Sequence-Number: 0

Server Response:
=========================
  Q4S/1.0 200 OK
       Session-Id: 53655765
       Sequence-Number: 0
       Content-Length: 0
=========================
]]></artwork>
          <t>
   The function of the PING method is similar to the ICMP echo
   request message <xref target="RFC0792" format="default"/>. 
   The server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> answer as soon as it receives the
   message.</t>
          <t>
   Both endpoints <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send Q4S PING messages with the periodicity
   specified in the first parameter of SDP "measurement:procedure"
   attribute, always using the same UDP ports and incrementing the
   Sequence-Number with each message.</t>
          <t>
   In the following example, the value of the first parameter of the SDP "measurement:procedure" attribute
   is 50 milliseconds (from the client to the server) and
   60 ms (from the server to the client):</t>
          <sourcecode type="sdp"><![CDATA[
a=measurement:procedure default(50/60,50/50,5000,256/256,256/256)
]]></sourcecode>
          <t>
   They <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> wait for a response to send the next PING request.
   The Sequence-Number header field value is incremented sequentially and
   <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> start at zero. If this stage is repeated, the initial
   Sequence-Number <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> start at zero again.</t>
          <t>
   All PING requests <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain a Measurements header field with the
   values of the latency, jitter, and packet loss measured by each
   entity up to that moment. The client will send its measurements to
   the server, and the server will send its measurements to the client. Example:</t>
          <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
      Measurements: l=22, j=13, pl=0.10, bw=
]]></artwork>
          <t>
   Where "l" stands for latency, "j" for jitter, "pl" for packet loss, and "bw"
   for bandwidth. The bandwidth value is omitted, as it is not
   measured at this stage.</t>
          <t>
   Optionally the PING request can include a Timestamp header field with
   the time in which the message has been sent. In the case that the header field is
   present, the server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the header field in the response
   without changing the value.</t>
          <t>
   A minimum number of PING messages <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be exchanged in order to be
   able to measure latency, jitter, and packet loss with certain
   accuracy (at least 256 samples are <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to get an accurate
   packet loss measurement). Both the client and the server calculate
   the respective measured parameter values. The mechanisms to
   calculate the different parameters are described in <xref target="sec-7.3" format="default"/>.</t>

          <t>
   At the end of this stage 0, there are three possibilities:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>The latency, jitter, and packetloss constraints are reached
      in both directions</li>
            <li>The latency, jitter, and packetloss constraints are not
      reached in one or both directions</li>
          </ul>
          <t>
   In the first case, Stage 0 is finished. The client and server are
   ready for Stage 1: bandwidth and packet loss measurement. The
   client moves to stage 1 by sending a READY message that includes the
   header field, "Stage: 1".</t>
          <t>
   If the bandwidth constraints are either empty or have a value of zero, the
   Negotiation phase <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> terminate, and both client and server may
   initiate the Continuity phase. In this case, client moves to the 
   Continuity phase by sending a READY message that includes the header field,
   "Stage: 2".</t>
          <t>
   The second case, in which one or more quality constraints have not
   been met, is detailed in <xref target="sec-7.5.4" format="default"/>.</t>

          <t>
   This stage begins in a similar way to stage 0, sending a READY
   request over TCP. The value of the READY message's Stage header field is 1.
   The server answers with a Q4S 200 OK message to synchronize the
   initiation of the measurements as shown in

   During the Negotiation phase, latency, jitter, bandwidth, and
   packet loss have been measured. During the Continuity phase,
   bandwidth will not be measured again because bandwidth
   measurements may disturb application performance.</t>

   This phase is supposed to be executed at the same time as the
   real-time application is being used.</t>
        <t>
   This document only covers the "default" procedure. The continuity
   operation with the "default" procedure is based on a sliding window of
   samples. The number of samples involved in the sliding window may
   be different for jitter and latency than for packet loss
   calculations according to the fifth and sixth parameters of the
   "measurement:procedure" attribute. In the example, shown in 
   <xref target="ref-sliding-samples-window" format="default"/>, 
   the jitter and latency sliding window comprises 40 samples,
   whereas the size of the packet loss sliding window is 100 samples:</t>

        <t>
   In addition, the sizes of these windows are configurable per
   direction: uplink and downlink values may differ.</t>
        <t>
   PING requests are sent continuously (in both directions), and when
   the Sequence-Number header field reaches the maximum value, the client
   continues sending PING messages with the Sequence-Number header field
   starting again at zero. When the server PING Sequence-Number
   header field reaches the maximum value, it does the same, starting again
   from zero.</t>
        <t>
   On the client side, the measured values of downlink jitter,
   downlink packet loss, and latency are calculated using the last
   samples, discarding older ones, in a sliding window schema.</t>

   The Termination phase is the endpoint for the established Q4S
   session that is reached in the following cases:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>A CANCEL message has been received. The client sends a
      CANCEL message due to the network's inability to
      meet the required quality constraints. The client and server
      application will be notified by their respective Q4S stacks.</li>
          <li>Session expires: if after the Expires time, no client or
      server activity is detected, that end cancels the session.</li>
          <li>A BEGIN message has been received by the server. 
     The pre-existing Q4S quality session is canceled, and a new session
      will be initiated.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   The meaning of the Termination phase in terms of the release of resources
   or accounting is application dependent and out of scope of the Q4S
   protocol.</t>
        <t>
   In the Reactive alerting mode, Q4S CANCEL messages received by the Q4S
   server must cause the server stack to send cancel notifications 
   to the Actuator in order to release possible
   assigned resources for the session.</t>

        <name>Dynamic Constraints and Flows</name>
        <t>
   Depending on the nature of the application, the quality
   constraints to be reached may evolve, changing some or all quality
   constraint values in any direction.</t>
        <t>
   The client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to deal with this possibility. When the
   server sends an SDP document attached to a response (200 OK or
   Q4S-ALERT, etc.), the client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> take all the new received values,
   overriding any previous value in use.</t>
        <t>
   The dynamic changes on the quality constraints can be a result
   of two possibilities:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The application communicates to the Q4S server a change in
      the constraints. In this case, the application requirements
      can evolve, and the Q4S server will be aware of them.</li>
          <li>The application uses TCP flows. In that case, in order to
      guarantee a constant throughput, the nature of TCP behavior
      forces the use of a composite constraint function, which
      depends on RTT, packet loss, and a window control mechanism
      implemented in each TCP stack.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   TCP throughput can be less than actual bandwidth if the
   Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) is large, or if the network suffers
   from a high packet loss rate. In both cases, TCP congestion
   control algorithms may result in a suboptimal performance.</t>
        <t>
   Different TCP congestion control implementations like Reno <xref target="RENO" format="default"/>,
   High Speed TCP <xref target="RFC3649" format="default"/>, 
   CUBIC <xref target="I-D.rhee-tcpm-cubic" format="default"/>, 
   Compound TCP (CTCP) <xref target="I-D.sridharan-tcpm-ctcp" format="default"/>, 
   etc., reach different throughputs under the same network
   conditions of RTT and packet loss. In all cases, depending on the
   RTT-measured value, the Q4S server could dynamically change the
   packetloss constraints (defined in the SDP) in order to make it possible
   to reach a required throughput or vice versa (using "measurement:packetloss"
   to change dynamically the latency constraints).</t>
        <t>
   A general guideline for calculating the packet loss constraint and the RTT
   constraint consists of approximating the throughput by using a
   simplified formula, which should take into account the TCP stack
   implementation of the receiver, in addition to the RTT and packet
   loss:</t>
        <sourcecode type="pseudocode"><![CDATA[
          Th= Function( RTT, packet loss, ...)
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>
   Then, depending on RTT-measured values, set dynamically the
   packet loss constraint.</t>
        <t>
   It is possible to easily calculate a worst-case boundary for the
   Reno algorithm, which should ensure for all algorithms that the
   target throughput is actually achieved, except that high-speed
   algorithms will then have even larger throughput if more
   bandwidth is available.</t>
        <t>
   For the Reno algorithm, the Mathis formula may be used <xref target="RENO" format="default"/> for
   the upper bound on the throughput:</t>
        <sourcecode type="pseudocode"><![CDATA[
          Th <= (MSS/RTT)*(1 / sqrt{p})
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>
   In the absence of packet loss, a practical limit for the TCP
   throughput is the receiver_window_size divided by the RTT.
   However, if the TCP implementation uses a window scale
   option, this limit can reach the available bandwidth value.</t>

        <name>"qos-level" Upgrade and Downgrade Operation</name>
        <t>
   Each time the server detects a violation of constraints, the alert
   mechanism is triggered, the "alert-pause" timer is started, and the
   "qos-level" is increased. When this happens repeatedly, and the 
   "qos-level" reaches its maximum value (value 9), the session is
   canceled. But when the violation of constraints stops before
   reaching "qos-level" maximum value, the recovery mechanism allows
   for the "qos-level" upgrade gradually.</t>
        <t>
   This downgrade and upgrade of "qos-level" is explained
   with the following example:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>A Q4S session is initiated successfully with "qos-level=0".</li>
          <li>During the Continuity phase, violation of constraints is
      detected; the "qos-level" is increased to 1, a Q4S-ALERT is sent by
      the server to the client, and an "alert-pause" timer is started.</li>
          <li>The "alert-pause" timer expires, and still a violation of constraints
      is detected; the "qos-level" is increased to 2, a Q4S-ALERT is sent
      by the server to the client, and an "alert-pause" timer is started.</li>
          <li>The "alert-pause" timer expires, but the violation of constraints has
      stopped; the "recovery-pause" timer is started.</li>
          <li>The "recovery-pause" timer expires, and no violation of
      constraints has been detected. Meanwhile, the "qos-level" is
      decreased to 1, a Q4S-RECOVERY is sent by the server to the
      client, and the "recovery-pause" timer is started again.</li>
          <li>The "recovery-pause" timer expires again, and no violation of
      constraints has been detected. Meanwhile, the "qos-level" is
      decreased to 0, and a Q4S-RECOVERY is sent by the server to
      the client. The "recovery-pause" timer is not started this time as
      the "qos-level" has reached its initial value.</li>
        </ol>
        <t>
   When the network configuration allows for the possibility of
   managing Q4S flows and application flows independently (either is
   a network-based QoS or a Q4S-aware network), the "qos-level"
   downgrade process could be managed more efficiently using a
   strategy that allows for carrying out "qos-level" downgrades
   excluding application flows from SDP dynamically. The Q4S flows would be
   downgraded to allow for measurements on a lower quality level
   without interference of the application flows. A Q4S client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
   allow this kind of SDP modification by the server.</t>
        <t>
   Periodically (every several minutes, depending on the
   implementation) a Q4S-ALERT could be triggered, in which the level
   is downgraded for Q4S flows, excluding application flows from the
   embedded SDP of that request.</t>
        <t>
   This mechanism allows the measurement at lower levels of quality while
   application flows continue using a higher "qos-level" value.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>If the measurements in the lower level meet the quality
      constraints, then a Q4S-RECOVERY message to this lower "qos-level" may be triggered, in which the SDP includes the
      application flows in addition to the Q4S flows.</li>
          <li>If the measurements in the lower level do not meet the
      constraints, then a new Q4S-ALERT to the previous "qos-level"
      <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be triggered, in which the SDP includes only the Q4S
      flows.</li>

   To provide a default configuration, it would be good if the
   client had a configurable set of quality headers in the
   implementation settings menu. Otherwise, these quality headers will
   not be present in the first message.</t>
        <t>
   Different business models (out of scope of this proposal) may be
   achieved: depending on who pays for the quality session, the
   server can accept certain client parameters sent in the first
   message, or force billing parameters on the server side.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-9.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Latency and Jitter Measurements</name>
        <t>
   Different client and server implementations may send a different
   number of PING messages for measuring, although at least 255
   messages should be considered to perform the latency measurement.
   The Stage 0 measurements may be considered ended only when neither
   the client nor server receive new PING messages after an
   implementation-dependent guard time. Only after, the client can send a
   "READY 1" message.</t>
        <t>
   In execution systems, where the timers are not accurate, a
   recommended approach consists of including the optional Timestamp header field
   in the PING request with the time in which the message
   has been sent. This allows an accurate measurement of the jitter
   even with no identical intervals of time between PINGs.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-9.3" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Bandwidth Measurements</name>
        <t>
   In programming languages or operating systems with limited timers
   or clock resolution, it is recommended to use an approach based on
   several intervals to send messages of 1KB (= 8000 bits) in order
   to reach the required bandwidth consumption, using a rate as close
   as possible to a constant rate.</t>
        <t>
   For example, if the resolution is 1 millisecond, and the bandwidth
   to reach is 11 Mbps, a good approach consists of sending: </t>
        <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
      1 message of 1KB every 1 millisecond +

      1 message of 1KB every 3 milliseconds +

      1 message of 1KB every 23 milliseconds
]]></artwork>
        <t>
   The number of intervals depends on the required bandwidth and accuracy
   that the programmer wants to achieve.</t>
        <t>
   Considering messages of 1KB (= 8000 bits), a general approach to
   determine these intervals is the following:

        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="(%d)">
          <li> Compute target bandwidth / 8000 bits. In the example above, it is
            11 Mbps / 8000 = 1375 messages per second.
	</li>
          <li> Divide the number of messages per second by 1000 to determine
    	the number of messages per millisecond: 1375 / 1000 = 1.375. The
      integer value is the number of messages per millisecond (in this
      case, one). The pending bandwidth is now 375 messages per second.
	</li>
          <li>
            <t> To achieve the 375 messages per second, use a submultiple of
	1000, which must be less than 375:
</t>
            <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
      1000 / 2 = 500 > 375

      1000 / 3 = 333 < 375 
]]></artwork>
            <t>

   In this case, a message every 3 ms is suitable. The new pending
   target bandwidth is 375 - 333 = 42 messages per second.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t> Repeat the same strategy as point 3 to reach the pending
    	    bandwidth. In this case, 23 ms is suitable because of the following:

</t>
            <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
      1000 / 22 = 45 > 42

      1000 / 23 = 43 > 42

      1000 / 24 = 41.6 < 42
]]></artwork>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <t>
   We can choose 24 ms, but then we need to cover an additional 0.4
   messages per second (42 - 41.6 = 0.4), and 43 is a number higher than
   42 but very close to it.</t>
        <t>
   In execution systems where the timers are not accurate, a
   recommended approach consists of checking at each interval the
   number of packets that should have been sent at this timestamp
   since origin and send the needed number of packets in order to
   reach the required bandwidth.</t>
        <t>
   The shorter the packets used, the more constant the rate of
   bandwidth measurement. However, this may stress the execution
   system in charge of receiving and processing packets. As a
   consequence, some packets may be lost because of stack overflows.
   To deal with this potential issue, a larger packet is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>
   (2KB or more), taking into account the overhead produced by the
   chunks' headers.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-9.4" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Packet Loss Measurement Resolution</name>
        <t>
   Depending on the application nature and network conditions, a packet
   loss resolution less than 1% may be needed. In such cases, there
   is no limit to the number of samples used for this calculation. A
   trade-off between time and resolution should be reached in each
   case. For example, in order to have a resolution of 1/10000, the
   last 10000 samples should be considered in the packet loss
   measured value.</t>
        <t>
   The problem of this approach is the reliability of old samples. If
   the interval used between PING messages is 50 ms, then to have a
   resolution of 1/1000, it takes 50 seconds, and a resolution of
   1/10000 takes 500 seconds (more than 8 minutes). The reliability
   of a packet loss calculation based on a sliding window of 8
   minutes depends on how fast network conditions evolve.</t>

   Q4S can be used as a mechanism to measure and trigger network

      <section anchor="sec-9.6" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Instability Treatments</name>
        <t>
   There are two scenarios in which Q4S can be affected by network
   problems: loss of Q4S packets and outlier samples.</t>
        <section anchor="sec-9.6.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Loss of Control Packets</name>
          <t>
   Lost UDP packets (PING or BWIDTH messages) don't cause any
   problems for the Q4S state machine, but if TCP packets are
   delivered too late (which we will consider as "lost"), some
   undesirable consequences could arise.</t>
          <t>
   Q4S does have protection mechanisms to overcome these situations.
   Examples:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>If a BEGIN packet or its corresponding answer is lost, after
      a certain timeout, the client <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> resend another BEGIN
      packet, resetting the session</li>
            <li>If a READY packet is lost, after a certain timeout, the
      client <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> resend another READY packet.</li>
            <li>If a Q4S-ALERT request or its corresponding answer is lost,
      after a certain timeout, the originator <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> resend another
      Q4S-ALERT packet.</li>
            <li>If a CANCEL request or its corresponding answer is lost,
      after a certain timeout, the originator <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> resend another
      CANCEL packet.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sec-9.6.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Outlier Samples</name>
          <t>
   Outlier samples are those jitter or latency values far from the
   general/average values of most samples.</t>
          <t>
   Hence, the Q4S default measurement method uses the statistical median
   formula for latency calculation, and the outlier samples are
   neutralized. This is a very common filter for noise or errors

   Because Q4S does not transport any application data, Q4S does not
   jeopardize the security of application data. However, other
   certain considerations may take place, like identity impersonation

        <t>
   Identity impersonation could potentially produce anomalous Q4S
   measurements. If this attack is based on spoofing of the server IP
   address, it can be avoided using the digital signature mechanism
   included in the SDP. The network can easily validate this digital
   signature using the public key of the server certificate.</t>
        <t>
   Integrity of Q4S measurements under any malicious manipulation
   (such as a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack) relies on the same
   mechanism, the SDP signature.</t>
        <t>
   The Signature header field contains the signed hash value of the SDP
   body in order to protect all the SDP data, including the
   measurements. This signature not only protects the integrity of
   data but also authenticates the server.</t>

        <name>Privacy of Measurements</name>
        <t>
   This protocol could be supported over IPsec. Q4S relies on UDP and
   TCP, and IPsec supports both.  If Q4S is used for application-based 
   QoS, then IPsec is operationally valid; however, if Q4S is used to 
   trigger network-based actions, then measurements could be incorrect 
   unless the IPsec ports can be a target of potential action over the 
   network (such as prioritizing IPsec flows to measure the new, upgraded

   Any loss of connectivity may interrupt the availability of the Q4S
   service and may result in higher packet loss measurements, which is
   just the desired behavior in these situations.</t>
        <t>
   In order to mitigate availability issues caused by malicious
   attacks (such as DoS and DDoS), a good practice is to enable the Q4S
   service only for authenticated users. Q4S can be launched after the
   user is authenticated by the application. At this moment, the user's IP
   address is known, and the Q4S service may be enabled for this IP
   address. Otherwise, the Q4S service should appear unreachable.</t>

        <name>Bandwidth Occupancy Issues</name>
        <t>
   Q4S bandwidth measurement is limited to the application needs. It
   means that all available bandwidth is not measured, but only the
   fraction required by the application. This allows other
   applications to use the rest of available bandwidth normally.</t>
        <t>
   However, a malicious Q4S client could restart Q4S sessions just

   waste bandwidth for nothing.</t>
        <t>
