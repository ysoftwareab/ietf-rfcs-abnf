      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains registries
      to track code points used
         by protocols such as those defined by the IETF and documented in RFCs developed on the IETF Stream.
         A full list of registries and code points can be found at
         <eref target="https://www.iana.org/protocols"/>.</t>
      <t>Requests may be made to IANA for actions to create registries or to allocate code points from
         existing registries.  Procedures for these operations are described in <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Many requests for IANA action are included in documents that are progressed for publication as RFCs.
         RFCs may be sourced from within the IETF (on the IETF Stream) but may also be sourced from other
         streams, including the Independent Submission Stream (the Independent Stream), as described in
         <xref target="RFC4846" format="default"/>.  The Independent Stream is under the care of the Independent Submissions Editor
         (ISE).</t>
      <t>This document complements <xref target="RFC4846" format="default"/> by providing a description of how the ISE
         currently handles documents in the Independent Stream that request actions from IANA.  Nothing
         in this document changes existing IANA registries or their allocation policies, nor does it change
         any previously documented processes.</t>
      <t>If a case arises that is not precisely covered by this document, the ISE may discuss
         a solution with the interested parties, including IANA, the IESG, the stream managers for other streams,
         and the authors of an Independent Submission that requests IANA action.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="exist" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Allocations from Existing Registries</name>
      <t>Each IANA registry is governed by an allocation policy -- the rules that IANA applies to determine
         which code points can be allocated and under what circumstances.  These policies are described in
         <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Documents proceeding from the Independent Stream will always follow the assignment policies defined
         for the registries from which they request allocations.  Similarly, all code point assignments are
         subject to the oversight of any designated expert (DE) appointed for the registry.</t>
      <t>It should be noted that documents on the Independent Stream can never result in Standards Track
         RFCs and Independent Stream documents are never subject to IETF review.  Thus, a registry whose
         policy is "IETF Review" or "Standards Action" <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/> is not available to Independent Stream
         documents.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="change" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Changing Policies of Existing Registries</name>
      <t>From time to time, a decision is made to change the allocation policy for a registry.  Such changes
          are normally only made using the allocation policy of the registry itself and usually require documentation
          from the same stream that created the registry.</t>
      <t>Independent Stream RFCs will not seek to change the allocation policies of any registries except
          those created by documents from the Independent Stream.  The list of such registries is itself
          very limited (see <xref target="new" format="default"/>).</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="new" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Creating New IANA Registries</name>
<t>Sometimes registries are needed to track a new set of code points for a new protocol or an extension to an existing protocol.</t>
<t>In general, documents on the Independent Stream cannot request the
   creation of a new IANA registry.</t>

<t>The only exception to this rule is when a document to be published in
   the Independent Submission Stream requests the allocation of a code
   point from an existing registry with the allocation policy Specification
   Required, Expert Review, RFC Required, or First Come First Served.
   Then the document to be published may also need to create a registry
   that is tied to that specific code point and is used for
   interpreting a sub-code.</t>

<t>Consider, for example, the "Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   Schemes" registry <xref target="URL-URIschemes"/>.  From time to time, a URI scheme
   may need a registry of associated parameters; for example, consider
   the tel URI scheme that has a register of parameters called the "tel
   URI Parameters" <xref target="URL-telURI"/>.</t>

<t>Such examples are rare and only exist to support the allocation from
   the base registry.  In such cases, where there is an appointed DE for
   the existing base registry, the assignment of the individual code
   point from the existing base registry and the creation of the new
   registry can only happen if the DE approves both actions.</t>

<t>There are several further constraints on the new registry:</t>
<ul>
<li>The allocation policy for the new registry may only be First Come
      First Served, RFC Required, Experimental, or Private Use.  In
      particular, no registry may be created that would require IETF
      action to achieve a future code point allocation.  See <xref
      target="de"/> for an explanation of why the application of Specification
      Required and Expert Review are not acceptable policies for any
      registry created from a document in the Independent Stream.</li>
<li>If the allocation policy for the new registry is First Come First Served,
the document must contain a brief statement and explanation of the expected arrival rate of new registrations over time.</li>
<li>The new registry must contain a clear statement of the escalation
      process for any issues that arise with the registry.  A model for
      this statement is as follows:</li></ul> 
<blockquote>
This registry was created by [RFCXXXX], which was published on
         the Independent Submission Stream.  Any issues that arise with
         the management of this registry will be resolved by IANA in
         consultation with the Independent Submissions Editor.</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The IESG will be invited to provide its opinions about the
      advisability of the creation of any new registries during its
      conflict review of the document <xref target="RFC5742"/>, and the ISE will give
      full consideration to such opinions.</li></ul>
<t>
   Authors of Independent Submission Stream documents should consider
   the most appropriate venue to host such registries, taking into
   account where the expertise for managing and reviewing registry
   assignments may be found.  In some cases, this may mean that
   registries are hosted by organizations other than IANA.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="de" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Assigning Designated Experts</name>
      <t>Some IANA allocation policies (specifically, Specification Required and Expert Review) utilize
          the review of a DE.  The procedures applicable to the appointment and actions of a DE are
          described in <xref target="RFC8126" sectionFormat="of" section="5"/>.</t>
      <t>When a DE is appointed, the position must be maintained and supported by whoever designated the
          DE in the first place.  That is, someone must appoint replacement DEs if necessary, and someone
          must provide a backstop in case the appointed DEs are unresponsive.</t>
      <t>The ISE will not appoint a DE.  That means that no subregistry created for Independent Stream
          documents will require the review of a DE.  That means that no new subregistry can be
          created that uses the Specification Required or Expert Review policies.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="tx" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Transfer of Control</name>
      <t>Very rarely, it may be desirable to transfer "ownership" of an IANA registry from the Independent
          Stream to the IETF Stream.  This might happen, for example, if a protocol was originally
          documented in the Independent Stream but has been adopted for work and standardization
          in the IETF.  Such a transfer may require an IETF Stream RFC to act as the base reference for the
          registry and will require discussion and agreement with the ISE.</t>
      <t>Ownership of a registry will not be transferred from the IETF Stream to the Independent Stream.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="IANA" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>IANA Considerations</name>
      <t>This document is all about IANA actions but makes no request for IANA action.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="Security" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>There are no direct security considerations arising from this document.  It may be noted that some IANA
         registries relate to security protocols, and the stability and proper management of those registries
         contribute to the stability of the protocols themselves.  That is a benefit for the security of the
         Internet and the users of the Internet.</t>
