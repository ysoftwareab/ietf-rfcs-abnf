    <abstract>
      <t>
The IEEE originally structured the 48-bit Media Access Control (MAC) address space in such a way that half
of it was reserved for local use. In 2017, the IEEE published a new standard (IEEE
Std 802c) with a new optional Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP). It
specifies different assignment approaches in four specified regions of the local
MAC address space.
      </t>
      <t>
The IEEE is developing protocols to assign addresses (IEEE
P802.1CQ). There is also work
in the IETF on specifying a new mechanism that extends DHCPv6 operation to
handle the local MAC address assignments.
      </t>
      <t>
This document proposes extensions to DHCPv6 protocols to enable a DHCPv6 client
or a DHCPv6 relay to indicate a preferred SLAP quadrant to the server so that
the server may allocate MAC addresses in the quadrant requested by the relay or
client. A new DHCPv6 option (QUAD) is defined for this purpose.

      <t>The IEEE structures the 48-bit MAC address space in such a way that half of it is
reserved for local use (where the Universal/Local (U/L) bit is set to 1). In
2017, the IEEE published a new standard <xref target="IEEEStd802c" format="default"/>
that defines a new optional Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP) that
specifies different assignment approaches in four specified regions of the local
MAC address space. These four regions, called SLAP quadrants, are briefly
described below (see <xref target="fig_ieee_48bit_mac" format="default"/> and <xref target="fig_slap_quadrants" format="default"/> for details):

      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
In SLAP Quadrant 01, Extended Local Identifier (ELI) MAC addresses are
assigned based on a 24-bit Company ID (CID), which is assigned by the IEEE Registration
Authority (RA). The remaining bits are specified as an extension by the CID
assignee or by a protocol designated by the CID assignee.
          </li>
        <li>
In SLAP Quadrant 11, Standard Assigned Identifier (SAI) MAC addresses are
assigned based on a protocol specified in an IEEE 802 standard. For 48-bit MAC
addresses, 44 bits are available. Multiple protocols for assigning SAIs may be
specified in IEEE standards. Coexistence of multiple protocols may be supported
by limiting the subspace available for assignment by each protocol.
          </li>
        <li>
In SLAP Quadrant 00, Administratively Assigned Identifier (AAI) MAC addresses
are assigned locally by an administrator. Multicast IPv6 packets use a
destination address starting in 33-33, so AAI addresses in that range should not
be assigned. For 48-bit MAC addresses, 44 bits are available.
          </li>
        <li>
SLAP Quadrant 10 is "Reserved for future use" where MAC addresses may be
assigned using new methods yet to be defined or until then by an administrator
as in the AAI quadrant. For 48-bit MAC addresses, 44 bits would be available.

        <name>Problem Statement</name>
        <t>
	  
The IEEE is developing mechanisms to assign addresses <xref
target="IEEE-P802.1CQ-Project" format="default"/>. And <xref target="RFC8947"
format="default"/> specifies a new mechanism that extends DHCPv6 operation to handle the local MAC
address assignments.



This document proposes extensions to DHCPv6 protocols to
enable a DHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6 relay to indicate a preferred SLAP quadrant
to the server so that the server may allocate the MAC addresses in the quadrant
requested by the relay or client.
        </t>
        <t>
In the following, we describe two application scenarios in which a need arises
to assign local MAC addresses according to preferred SLAP quadrants.
        </t>
        <section anchor="sec_wifi_devices" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) Devices</name>
          <t>
Today, most Wi-Fi devices come with interfaces that have a "burned-in" MAC
address, allocated from the universal address space using a 24-bit
Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) (assigned to IEEE 802 interface
vendors). However, recently, the need to assign local (instead of universal) MAC
addresses has emerged particularly in the following two scenarios:
          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
IoT (Internet of Things): In general, composed of constrained devices <xref
target="RFC7228" format="default"/> with constraints such as available power
and energy, memory, 
and processing resources. Examples of this include sensors and actuators for
health or home automation applications. Given the increasingly high number of
these devices, manufacturers might prefer to equip devices with temporary MAC
addresses used only at first boot. These temporary MAC addresses would just be
used to send initial DHCP packets to available DHCP servers. IoT devices
typically need a single MAC address for each available network interface. Once
the server assigns a MAC address, the device would abandon its temporary MAC
address. Home automation IoT devices typically do not move (however, note that
there is an increase of mobile smart health monitoring devices). For
this type of device, in general, any type of SLAP quadrant would be good for
assigning addresses, but ELI/SAI quadrants might be more suitable in some
scenarios. For example, the device might need to use an address from the CID
assigned to the IoT communication&nbsp;device vendor, thus preferring the ELI
quadrant.
              </li>
            <li>
Privacy: Today, MAC addresses allow the exposure of user locations making it
relatively easy to track user movements. One of the mechanisms considered to
mitigate this problem is the use of local random MAC addresses: changing them
every time the user connects to a different network. In this scenario, devices
are typically mobile. Here, AAI is probably the best SLAP quadrant from which to
assign addresses; it is the best fit for randomization of addresses, and it is
not required for the addresses to survive when changing networks.
              </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sec_hypervisors" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Hypervisor: Functions That Are and Are Not Migratable</name>
          <t>
In large-scale virtualization environments, thousands of virtual machines (VMs)
are active. These VMs are typically managed by a hypervisor, which is in charge of
spawning and stopping VMs as needed. The hypervisor is also typically in charge
of assigning new MAC addresses to the VMs. If a DHCP solution is in place for
that, the hypervisor acts as a DHCP client and requests that available DHCP servers
assign one or more MAC addresses (an address block). The hypervisor does not
use those addresses for itself, but rather it uses them to create new VMs with
appropriate MAC addresses. If we assume very large data-center environments,
such as the ones that are typically used nowadays, it is expected that the data
center is divided in different network regions, each one managing its own local
address space. In this scenario, there are two possible situations that need to
be tackled:

          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
<li>Migratable functions: If a VM (providing a given function) needs to be migrated
to another region of the data center (e.g., for maintenance, resilience,
end-user mobility, etc.), the VM's networking context needs to migrate with the
VM. This includes the VM's MAC address(es). Since the assignments from the
ELI/SAI SLAP quadrants are governed by rules per IEEE Std 802c, they are more
appropriate for use to ensure MAC address uniqueness globally in the data center.
              </li>

<li>Functions that are not migratable: If a VM will not be migrated to another region of the
data center, there are no requirements associated with its MAC address. In this
case, it is simpler to allocate it from the AAI SLAP quadrant, which does
not need to be unique across multiple data centers (i.e., each region can
manage its own MAC address assignment without checking for duplicates
globally).

        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
Link-layer addresses (i.e., MAC addresses) are assigned in blocks. The smallest
block is a single address. To request an assignment, the client sends a Solicit
message with an IA_LL option in the message. The IA_LL option <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain an
LLADDR option. In order to indicate the preferred SLAP quadrant(s), the IA_LL
option includes the new OPTION_SLAP_QUAD option in the IA_LL-option field (alongside the
LLADDR option).
            </li>
            <li>

	      
The server, upon receiving an IA_LL option in a Solicit message, inspects its contents.
For each of the entries in the OPTION_SLAP_QUAD, in order of the preference field
(highest to lowest), the server checks if it has a configured MAC address pool
matching the requested quadrant identifier and an available range of addresses
of the requested size. If suitable addresses are found, the server sends back an
Advertise message with an IA_LL option containing an LLADDR option that
specifies the addresses being offered. If the server manages a block of
addresses belonging to a requested quadrant, the addresses being offered <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
belong to a requested quadrant. If the server does not have a configured address
pool matching the client's request, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> return the IA_LL option with the
addresses being offered belonging to a quadrant managed by the server (following
a local policy to select from which of the available quadrants). If the server
has a configured address pool of the correct quadrant but no available
addresses, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return the IA_LL option containing a Status Code option with
status set to NoAddrsAvail.
            </li>
          <li>
The client waits for available servers to send Advertise responses and picks one
server, as defined in <xref target="RFC8415" section="18.2.9" sectionFormat="of"/>. The client
<bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> pick a server that does not advertise an address in the requested
quadrant(s). The client then sends a Request message that includes the IA_LL
container option with the LLADDR option copied from the Advertise message sent
by the chosen server. It includes the preferred SLAP quadrant(s) in a new QUAD
IA_LL option.
            </li>
          <li>
Upon reception of a Request message with an IA_LL container option, the server
assigns requested addresses. The server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> alter the allocation at this time
(e.g., by reducing the address block). It then generates and sends a Reply
message back to the client. Upon receiving a Reply message, the client parses
the IA_LL container option and may start using all provided addresses. Note that
a client that has included a Rapid Commit option in the Solicit
message may receive a
Reply message in response to the Solicit message and skip the
Advertise and Request message steps above
(following standard DHCPv6 procedures).
            </li>
          <li>
The client is expected to periodically renew the link-layer addresses, as
governed by T1 and T2 timers. This mechanism can be administratively disabled by
the server sending "infinity" as the T1 and T2 values (see <xref target="RFC8415" section="7.7" sectionFormat="of"/>). The client sends a Renew option after T1. It includes the
preferred SLAP quadrant(s) in the new QUAD IA_LL option, so in case the server
is unable to extend the lifetime on the existing address(es), the preferred
quadrants are known for the allocation of any "new" (i.e., different) addresses.
            </li>
          <li>
The server responds with a Reply message with an IA_LL option that includes an
LLADDR option with extended lifetime.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <t>
The client <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> check if the received MAC address comes from one of the
requested quadrants. It <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> repeat the process selecting a different DHCP server.

        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
Link-layer addresses (i.e., MAC addresses) are assigned in blocks. The smallest
block is a single address. To request an assignment, the client sends a Solicit
message with an IA_LL option in the message. The IA_LL option <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain an
LLADDR option.
            </li>
          <li>
The DHCP relay receives the Solicit message and encapsulates it in a
Relay-forward message. The relay, based on local knowledge and policies,
includes in the Relay-forward message the QUAD option with the preferred
quadrant. The relay might know which quadrant to request based on local
configuration (e.g., the served network contains IoT devices only, thus
requiring ELI/SAI) or other means. Note that if a client sends multiple
instances of the IA_LL option in the same message, the DHCP relay <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> only
add a single instance of the QUAD option.
            </li>
          <li>
Upon receiving a relayed message containing an IA_LL option, the server inspects
the contents for instances of OPTION_SLAP_QUAD in both the Relay-forward message
and the client's message payload. Depending on the server's policy, the
instance of the option to process is selected (see the end of this
section). For each of the entries in OPTION_SLAP_QUAD, in order of the
preference field (highest to lowest), the server checks if it has a configured
MAC address pool matching the requested quadrant identifier and an available
range of addresses of the requested size. If suitable addresses are found, the
server sends back an Advertise message with an IA_LL option containing an LLADDR
option that specifies the addresses being offered. This message is sent to the
Relay in a Relay-reply message. If the server supports the semantics of the
preferred quadrant included in the QUAD option and manages a block of addresses
belonging to a requested quadrant, then the addresses being offered <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
belong to a requested quadrant. The server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> apply the contents of the
relay's supplied QUAD option for all of the client's IA_LLs, unless configured
to do otherwise.
            </li>
          <li>
The relay sends the received Advertise message to the client.
            </li>
          <li>
The client waits for available servers to send Advertise responses and picks one
server, as defined in <xref target="RFC8415" section="18.2.9" sectionFormat="of"/>. The client then sends a Request message that includes the IA_LL container
option with the LLADDR option copied from the Advertise message sent by the
chosen server.
            </li>
          <li>
The relay forwards the received Request in a Relay-forward message. It adds, in the
Relay-forward, a QUAD IA_LL option with the preferred quadrant.
            </li>
          <li>
Upon reception of the forwarded Request message with IA_LL container option, the
server assigns requested addresses. The server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> alter the allocation at this
time. It then generates and sends a Reply message in a Relay-reply
message back to the
relay.
            </li>
          <li>
Upon receiving a Reply message, the client parses the IA_LL container option and
may start using all provided addresses.
            </li>
          <li>
The client is expected to periodically renew the link-layer addresses, as
governed by T1 and T2 timers. This mechanism can be administratively disabled by
the server sending "infinity" as the T1 and T2 values (see <xref target="RFC8415" section="7.7" sectionFormat="of"/>). The client sends a Renew option after T1.
            </li>
          <li>
This message is forwarded by the relay in a Relay-forward message, including a QUAD
IA_LL option with the preferred quadrant.
            </li>
          <li>
The server responds with a Reply message, including an LLADDR option with
extended lifetime. This message is sent in a Relay-reply message.
            </li>
          <li>
The relay sends the Reply message back to the client.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <t>
The server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> implement a configuration parameter to deal with&nbsp;the case
where the client's DHCP message contains an instance of OPTION_SLAP_QUAD and
the relay adds a second instance in its Relay-forward message. This parameter
configures the server to process either the client's or the relay's instance of
option QUAD. It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the default for such a parameter is to
process the client's instance of the option.
        </t>
        <t>
The client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> check if the received MAC address belongs to a quadrant it is
willing to use/configure and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> decide based on that whether to use/configure
the received address.

          <dt>pref-n</dt>
          <dd>
Preference associated to quadrant-n. A higher value means a more preferred
quadrant. This is a 1-byte field.

        <t>
A quadrant identifier value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only appear, at most, once in the option.&nbsp;If
an&nbsp;option includes more than one occurrence of the same quadrant identifier,
only the first occurrence is processed, and the rest <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored by the
server.
        </t>
        <t>
If the same preference value is used for more than one quadrant, the server
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> select which quadrant should be preferred (if the server can assign
addresses from all or some of the quadrants with the same assigned
preference). Note that this is not a simple list of quadrants ordered by
preference with no preference value, but a list of quadrants with explicit
preference values. This way it can support the case whereby a client really
has no preference between two or three quadrants, leaving the decision to the
server.
        </t>
        <t>
If the client or relay agent provides the OPTION_SLAP_QUAD, the server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use
the quadrant-n/pref-n values to order the selection of the quadrants. If the
server can provide an assignment from one of the specified quadrants, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
proceed with the assignment. If the server does not have a configured address
pool matching any of the specified quadrant-n fields or if the server has a
configured address pool of the correct quadrant but no available addresses,
it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return the IA_LL option containing a status of NoAddrsAvail.
        </t>
        <t>
There is no requirement that the client or relay agent order the quadrant/pref
values in any specific order; hence, servers <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> assume that
quadrant-1/pref-1 have the highest preference (except if there is only one set of
values).
        </t>
        <t>
For cases where a server may not be configured to have pools for the client or
relay quadrant preferences, clients and relays <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> specify all quadrants in
the QUAD option to assure the client gets an address (or addresses) -- if any
are available. Specifying all quadrants also results in a QUAD option supporting
server responding like a non-QUAD option supporting server, i.e., an address (or
addresses) from any available quadrants can be returned.

      <name>Example Uses of Quadrant Selection Mechanisms</name>
      <t>
This appendix describes some examples of how the quadrant preference mechanisms
could be used.
      </t>
      <t>
First, let's take an IoT scenario as an example. An IoT device might decide on
its own the SLAP quadrant it wants to use to obtain a local MAC address, using
the following information to make the decision:

      </t>

      <ul spacing="normal">
	<li>Type of IoT deployment: For example, industrial, domestic, rural, etc. For small
deployments, such as domestic ones, the IoT device itself can decide to use the AAI
quadrant (this might not even involve the use of DHCP, by the device just
configuring a random address computed by the device itself). For large
deployments, such as industrial or rural ones, where thousands of devices
might coexist, the IoT can decide to use the ELI or SAI quadrants.</li>
      
<li>Mobility: If the IoT device can move, then it might prefer to select the SAI
or AAI quadrants to minimize address collisions when moving to another network.
If the device is known to remain fixed, then the ELI is probably the most
suitable one to use.</li>
   
<li>Managed/Unmanaged: Depending on whether the IoT device is managed during its
lifetime or cannot be reconfigured <xref target="RFC7548" format="default"/>, the decision of
what quadrant is more appropriate might be different. For example, if the IoT
device can be managed (e.g., configured) and network topology changes might
occur during its lifetime (e.g., due to changes on the deployment, such as
extensions involving additional devices), this has an impact on the preferred
quadrant (e.g., to avoid potential collisions in the future).</li>
     
<li>Operation / Battery Lifetime: Depending on the expected lifetime of the device, a
different quadrant might be preferred (as before, to minimize potential address
collisions in the future).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <t>
The previous parameters are considerations that the device vendor/administrator
may wish to use when defining the IoT device's MAC&nbsp;address request policy (i.e.,
how to select a given SLAP quadrant). IoT devices are typically very resource
constrained, so there may only be a simple decision-making process based on
preconfigured preferences.
      </t>
      <t>
We now take the Wi-Fi device scenario, considering, for example, that a laptop
or smartphone connects to a network using its built-in MAC address. Due to
privacy/security concerns, the device might want to configure a local MAC
address. The device might use different parameters and context information to
decide, not only which SLAP quadrant to use for the local MAC address
configuration, but also when to perform a change of address (e.g., it might be
needed to change address several times). This information includes, but it is
not limited to:

      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
Type of network the device is connected: public, work, home.
            </li>
        <li>
Trusted network: Yes/No.
            </li>
        <li>
First time visited network: Yes/No.
            </li>
        <li>
Network geographical location.
            </li>
        <li>
Mobility: Yes (the device might change its network attachment point) / No (the
device is not going to change its network attachment point).
            </li>
        <li>
Operating System (OS) network profile, including security/trust-related
parameters: Most modern OSs keep metadata associated with the networks they can
attach to as, for example, the level of trust the user or administrator assigns
to the network. This information is used to configure how the device behaves in
terms of advertising itself on the network, firewall settings, etc.

But this information can also be used to decide whether or not to configure a
local MAC address, from which SLAP quadrant it should be assigned, and how
often it may be assigned.
            </li>
        <li>
Triggers coming from applications regarding location privacy: An app might
request that the OS maximize location privacy (due to the nature of the
application), and this might require the OS to force the use of a local MAC
address or the local MAC address to be changed.

This information can be used by the device to select the SLAP quadrant. For
example, if the device is moving around (e.g., while connected to a public
network in an airport), it is likely that it might change access points several
times; therefore, it is best to minimize the chances of address collision,
using the SAI or AAI quadrants. If the device is not expected to move
and is attached to a
trusted network (e.g., in some scenarios at work), then it is probably best to select the ELI
quadrant. These are just some examples of how to use this information to select
the quadrant.
      </t>
      <t>
Additionally, the information can also be used to trigger subsequent changes of
MAC address to enhance location privacy. Besides, changing the SLAP
quadrant might also be used as an additional enhancement to make it harder to track
the user location.

      <t>
Last, if we consider the data-center scenario, a hypervisor might request local
MAC addresses be assigned to virtual machines. As in the previous scenarios,
the hypervisor might select the preferred SLAP quadrant using information
provided by the cloud management system or virtualization infrastructure
manager running on top of the hypervisor. This information might include,
but is not limited to:

      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
Migratable VM: If the function implemented by the VM is subject to be moved to
another physical server or not, this has an impact on the preference for the
SLAP quadrant, as the ELI and SAI quadrants are better suited for supporting
migration in a large data center.
            </li>
        <li>
VM connectivity characteristics: For example, standalone, part of a pool, and part of a
service graph/chain. If the connectivity characteristics of the VM are known,
this can be used by the hypervisor to select the best SLAP quadrant.
