   <t>
	   This document updates the IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless
	   Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery (ND)
	   protocol defined in RFCs 6775 and 8505.  The new extension
	   is called Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND), and
	   it protects the owner of an address against address theft
	   and impersonation attacks in a Low-Power and Lossy Network
	   (LLN).  Nodes supporting this extension compute a
	   cryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID), and use it with one
	   or more of their Registered Addresses. The Crypto-ID
	   identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be
	   used to provide proof of ownership of the Registered
	   Addresses. Once an address is registered with the Crypto-ID
	   and a proof of ownership is provided, only the owner of
	   that address can modify the registration information,
	   thereby enforcing Source Address Validation.

<section><name>Introduction</name>
    <t>
    	Neighbor Discovery optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks (aka 6LoWPAN ND) <xref target="RFC6775"/> adapts the original IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocols defined in <xref target="RFC4861"/> and <xref target="RFC4862"/> for constrained
    	Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). In particular, 6LoWPAN ND introduces a unicast host Address Registration mechanism that reduces the use of multicast compared to the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) mechanism defined in IPv6 ND. 6LoWPAN ND defines a new Address Registration Option (ARO) that is carried in the unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages exchanged between a 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and a 6LoWPAN Router (6LR). It also defines the Duplicate Address Request (DAR) and Duplicate Address Confirmation (DAC)
    	messages between the 6LR and the 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR). In LLNs, the 6LBR is the central repository of all the Registered Addresses in its domain.
    </t>

    <t>
    	The registration mechanism in "Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)" <xref target="RFC6775"></xref> prevents the use of an address if that address
    	is already registered in the subnet (first come, first served). In order to validate address ownership, "Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery" <xref target="RFC8505"></xref> defines a Registration Ownership Verifier (ROVR) field. <xref target="RFC8505"></xref> enables a 6LR and 6LBR to validate the association between the Registered Address of a node and its ROVR. The ROVR can be derived from the link-layer address of the device (using the 64-bit Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-64) address format specified by IEEE). However, the EUI-64 can be spoofed; therefore, any node connected to the subnet and aware of a registered-address-to-ROVR mapping could effectively fake the ROVR. This would allow an attacker to steal the address and redirect traffic for that address. <xref target="RFC8505"/> defines an Extended Address Registration Option (EARO) that transports alternate forms of ROVRs and is a prerequisite for this specification.
    </t>

    <t>
		  In this specification, a 6LN generates a cryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID) and places it in the ROVR field during the registration of one (or more) of its addresses with the 6LR(s). Proof of ownership of the Crypto-ID is passed with the first registration exchange to a new 6LR and enforced at the 6LR. The 6LR validates ownership of the
		  Crypto-ID before it creates any new registration state or changes existing information.
    </t>

    <t>
		  The protected address registration protocol proposed in this document provides the same conceptual benefit as Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) <xref target="RFC7039"/> in that only the owner of an IPv6 address may source packets with that address. As opposed to <xref target="RFC7039"/>, which relies on snooping protocols, the protection provided by this document is based on a state that is installed and maintained in the network by the owner of the address. With this specification, a 6LN may use a 6LR for forwarding an IPv6 packet if and only if it has registered the address used as the source of the packet with that 6LR.

    </t>

    <t>

		  With the 6LoWPAN adaptation layer in <xref
		  target="RFC4944"/> and <xref target="RFC6282"/>, a
		  6LN can obtain better compression for an IPv6
		  address with an Interface ID (IID) that is derived
		  from a Layer 2 (L2) address. Such compression is incompatible with "SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND") <xref target="RFC3971"/> and "Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs)" <xref target="RFC3972"/>, since they derive the IID from cryptographic keys. This specification, on the other hand, separates the IID generation from cryptographic computations and can enable better compression.

<section><name>Updating RFC 8505</name>
    <t>
       <xref target="RFC8505" sectionFormat="of" section="5.3"/> introduces the ROVR that is used to detect and reject duplicate registrations in the DAD process. The ROVR is a generic object that is designed for both backward compatibility and the capability to introduce new computation methods in the future. Using a Crypto-ID per this specification is the <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> method. <xref target="sec-col"/> discusses collisions when heterogeneous methods to compute the ROVR field coexist inside a network.
    </t>
    <t>
        This specification introduces a new identifier called a Crypto-ID that is transported in the ROVR field and used to indirectly prove the ownership of an address that is being registered by means of <xref target="RFC8505"/>. The
        Crypto-ID is derived from a cryptographic public key and additional parameters.
    </t>
    <t>
        The overall mechanism requires the support of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and a hash function as detailed in <xref target="ndpso-generation"/>. To enable the verification of the proof, the Registering Node needs to supply certain parameters including a nonce and a signature that will demonstrate that the node possesses the private key corresponding to the public key used to build the Crypto-ID.
    </t>


    <t> The elliptic curves and the hash functions listed in <xref
    target="cryptotypetable"/> in <xref target="cryptotypereg"/> can
    be used with this specification; more may be added in the future
    to the corresponding IANA registry. The cryptographic algorithms used (including the curve and the representation conventions) are signaled by the Crypto-Type field in a new IPv6 ND Crypto-ID Parameters Option (CIPO) (see <xref target="cryptoidopt"/>) that contains the parameters that are necessary for address validation.
    A new NDP Signature Option (<xref target="ndpso"/>) is also specified in this document to carry the resulting signature. A Nonce Option <xref target="RFC3971"/> is added in the NA(EARO) that is used to request the validation, and all three options are needed in the NS(EARO) that provides the validation.
    </t>

<section anchor="cryptoifldg"><name>New Fields and Options</name>


    <section anchor="cryptoidalg"><name>New Crypto-ID</name>
    <t>
	The Crypto-ID is transported in the ROVR field of the EARO and the Extended Duplicate Address Request (EDAR) message and is associated with the Registered Address at the 6LR and the 6LBR.
	The ownership of a Crypto-ID can be demonstrated by cryptographic mechanisms, and by association, the ownership of the Registered Address can be ascertained.
    </t><t>
	A node in possession of the necessary cryptographic primitives <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use Crypto-ID by default as ROVR in its registrations. Whether a ROVR is a Crypto-ID is indicated by a new "C" flag in the EARO of the NS(EARO) message.
    </t>
<t>

   The Crypto-ID is derived from the public key and a modifier as follows:
</t><ol spacing="normal">
   <li>The hash function used internally by the signature scheme and indicated by the Crypto-Type (see <xref target="cryptotypetable"/> in <xref target="cryptotypereg"/>)
   is applied to the CIPO. Note that all the reserved and padding bits <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to zero.
   </li>
   <li> The leftmost bits of the resulting hash, up to the desired size, are used as the Crypto-ID.
   </li>
   </ol><t>
   At the time of this writing, a minimal size for the Crypto-ID of 128 bits is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> unless backward compatibility is needed <xref target="RFC8505"/> (in which case it is at least 64 bits). The size of the Crypto-ID is likely to increase in the future.

    <section anchor="ndpso"><name>NDP Signature Option</name>

    <t>
	This specification defines the NDP Signature Option (NDPSO). The NDPSO carries the signature that proves the ownership of the Crypto-ID and validates the address being registered. The format of the NDPSO is illustrated in <xref target="ndpso-fig"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
    As opposed to the RSA Signature Option (RSAO) defined in <xref target="RFC3971" sectionFormat="of" section="5.2">SEND</xref>, the NDPSO does not have a key hash field. Instead, the leftmost 128 bits of the ROVR field in the EARO are used as hash to retrieve the CIPO that contains the key material used for signature verification, left-padded if needed.
    </t>
      <t>
    Another difference is that the NDPSO signs a fixed set of fields as opposed to all options that appear prior to it in the ND message that bears the signature. This allows a CIPO that the 6LR already received to be omitted, at the expense of the capability to add arbitrary options that would be signed with an RSAO.
    </t>
    <t>
    An ND message that carries an NDPSO <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have one and only one EARO. The EARO <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain a Crypto-ID in the ROVR field, and the Crypto-ID <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be associated with the key pair used for the digital signature in the NDPSO.
    </t>
	<t>
    The CIPO may be present in the same message as the NDPSO. If it is not present, it can be found in an abstract table that was created by a previous message and indexed by the hash.

<section><name>Protocol Scope</name>
    <t>
	     The scope of the protocol specified here is a 6LoWPAN LLN, typically a stub network connected to a larger IP network via a border router called a 6LBR per <xref target="RFC6775"/>. A 6LBR has sufficient capability to satisfy the needs of DAD.
    </t>
    <t>
	     The 6LBR maintains registration state for all devices in its attached LLN.  Together with the first-hop router (the 6LR), the 6LBR assures uniqueness and grants ownership of an IPv6 address before it can be used in the LLN. This is in contrast to a traditional network that relies on IPv6 address autoconfiguration <xref target="RFC4862"/>, where there is no guarantee of ownership from the network, and each IPv6 Neighbor Discovery packet must be individually secured <xref target="RFC3971"/>.

	     In a mesh network, the 6LR is directly connected to the host device. This specification mandates that the peer-wise L2 security is deployed so that all the packets from a particular host are protected. The 6LR may be multiple hops away from the 6LBR. Packets are routed between the 6LR and the 6LBR via other 6LRs.
    </t>
    <t>
       This specification mandates that all the LLN links between the 6LR and the 6LBR are protected so that a packet that was validated by the first 6LR can be safely routed by other on-path 6LRs to the 6LBR.
    </t>
</section>

<section><name>Protocol Flows</name>
    <t>
	 The 6LR/6LBR ensures first come, first served by storing the ROVR associated to the address being registered upon the first registration and rejecting a registration with a different ROVR value. A 6LN can claim any address as long as it is the first to make that claim. After a successful registration, the 6LN becomes the owner of the Registered Address, and the address is bound to the ROVR value in the 6LR/6LBR registry.
    </t>
    <t>
    This specification protects the ownership of the address at the
    first hop (the edge). Its use in a network is signaled by the "A"
    flag in the 6CIO. The flag is set by the 6LBR and propagated
    unchanged by the 6LRs. Once every node in the network is upgraded to support this specification, the "A" flag can be set to turn the protection on globally.
    </t>
    <t>
	 The 6LN places a cryptographic identifier, the Crypto-ID, in the ROVR that is associated with the address at the first registration, enabling the 6LR to later challenge it to verify that it is the original Registering Node. The challenge may happen at any time at the discretion of the 6LR and the 6LBR. A valid registration in the 6LR or the 6LBR <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be altered until the challenge is complete.
     </t>
    <t>
     When the "A" flag in a subnet is set, the 6LR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> challenge the 6LN before it creates a Binding with the "C" flag set in the EARO. The 6LR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also challenge the 6LN when a new registration attempts to change a parameter of an already validated Binding for that 6LN, for instance, its Source link-layer address. Such verification protects against an attacker that attempts to steal the address of an honest node.
    </t>
     <t>
     The 6LR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> indicate to the 6LBR that it performed a successful validation by setting a status code of 5 ("Validation Requested") in the EDAR. Upon a subsequent EDAR from a new 6LR with a status code that is not 5 for a validated Binding, the 6LBR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> indicate to the new 6LR that it needs to challenge the 6LN using a status code of 5 in the Extended Duplicate Address Confirmation (EDAC).
    </t>
    <t>

     The 6LR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> challenge the 6LN when the 6LBR signals to do so, which is done with an EDAC message with a status code of 5. The EDAC is echoed by the 6LR in the NA(EARO) back to the Registering Node. The 6LR <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also challenge all its attached 6LNs at the time the 6LBR turns the "A" flag on in the 6CIO in orders to detect an issue immediately.
    </t>
    <t>If the 6LR does not support the Crypto-Type, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with an EARO status code of 10 "Validation Failed" without a challenge. In that case, the 6LN may try another Crypto-Type until it falls back to Crypto-Type 0, which <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be supported by all 6LRs.
    </t>
    <t>
	    A node may use more than one IPv6 address at the same time. The separation of the address and the cryptographic material avoids the need for the constrained device to compute multiple keys for multiple addresses. The 6LN <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use the same Crypto-ID to prove the ownership of multiple IPv6 addresses. The 6LN <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also derive multiple Crypto-IDs from the same key pair by changing the modifier.
    </t>

	    A 6LN registers to a 6LR that is one hop away from it with the "C" flag set in the EARO, indicating that the ROVR field contains a Crypto-ID.

The on-link (local) protocol interactions are shown in <xref target="Dynamic-fig"/>.

    <t>
        The Nonce Option contains a nonce value that, to the extent 	possible for the implementation, was never used before. This specification inherits the idea from <xref	target="RFC3971"/> that the nonce is a random value. Ideally, an implementation uses an unpredictable cryptographically random value <xref target="RFC4086"/>. But that may be impractical in some LLN scenarios with resource-constrained devices.
	</t>
	<t> Alternatively, the device may use an always-incrementing value saved in the same stable storage as the key, so they are lost together, and start at a best-effort random value as either the nonce value or a component to its computation.
	</t>
	<t>
	    The 6LN replies to the challenge with an NS(EARO) that includes the Nonce Option (shown as NonceLN in <xref target="Dynamic-fig"/>), the CIPO (<xref target="cryptoidopt"/>), and the NDPSO containing the signature. Both nonces are included in the signed material. This provides a "contributory behavior" that results in better security even when the nonces of one party are not generated as specified.
	</t>
	<t>
        The 6LR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> store the information associated with a Crypto-ID on the first NS exchange where it appears in a fashion that the CIPO parameters can be retrieved from the Crypto-ID alone.

  </t>

	<t>The steps for the registration to the 6LR are as follows:
        </t>
        <t>
            Upon the first exchange with a 6LR, a 6LN will be challenged to prove ownership of the Crypto-ID and the Target Address being registered in the Neighbor Solicitation message. When a 6LR receives an NS(EARO) registration with a new Crypto-ID as a ROVR, and unless the registration is rejected for another reason, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> challenge by responding with an NA(EARO) with a status code of "Validation Requested".
        </t>
        <t>
            Upon receiving a first NA(EARO) with a status code of "Validation Requested" from a 6LR, the Registering Node <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> retry its registration with a CIPO (<xref target="cryptoidopt"/>) that contains all the necessary material for building the Crypto-ID, the NonceLN that it generated, and the NDP Signature Option (<xref target="ndpso"/>) that proves its ownership of the Crypto-ID and intent of registering the Target Address. In subsequent revalidation with the same 6LR, the 6LN <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> try to omit the CIPO to save bandwidth, with the expectation that the 6LR saved it. If the validation fails and it gets challenged again, then it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> add the CIPO again.
        </t>
        <t>
            In order to validate the ownership, the 6LR performs the
	    same steps as the 6LN and rebuilds the Crypto-ID based on
	    the parameters in the CIPO. If the rebuilt Crypto-ID
	    matches the ROVR, the 6LN also verifies the signature
	    contained in the NDPSO. At that point, if the signature in the NDPSO can be verified, then the validation succeeds. Otherwise, the validation fails.
        </t>
        <t>
            If the 6LR fails to validate the signed NS(EARO), it responds with a status code of "Validation Failed". After receiving an NA(EARO) with a status code of "Validation Failed",
            the Registering Node <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> try an alternate Crypto-Type; even if Crypto-Type 0 fails, it may try to register a different address in the NS message.

	     The signature generated by the 6LN to provide proof of ownership of the
		 private key is carried in the NDPSO.
		 It is generated by the 6LN in a fashion that depends on the Crypto-Type

     The 6LR and the 6LBR communicate using ICMPv6 EDAR and EDAC messages <xref target="RFC8505"/> as shown in <xref target="figReg"/>.
     This specification extends EDAR/EDAC messages to carry cryptographically generated ROVR.

     </t>
    <t>
     The assumption is that the 6LR and the 6LBR maintain a security association to authenticate and protect the integrity of the EDAR and EDAC messages, so there is no need to propagate the proof of ownership to the 6LBR. The 6LBR implicitly trusts that the 6LR performs the verification when the 6LBR requires it, and if there is no further exchange from the 6LR to remove the state, the verification succeeded.

  	<section><name>Brown Field</name>
    <t>
    Only 6LRs that are upgraded to this specification are capable of challenging a registration and avoiding an attack. In a brown (mixed) network, an attacker may attach to a legacy 6LR and fool the 6LBR. So even if the "A" flag could be set at any time to
    test the protocol operation, the security will only be effective when all the 6LRs are upgraded.

    <section><name>Threats Identified in RFC 3971</name>
	   <t>
    	   Observations regarding the following threats to the local network in <xref target="RFC3971"/> also apply to this specification.
         </t>
         <dl spacing="normal">
            <dt>Neighbor Solicitation/Advertisement Spoofing:</dt><dd>
		        Threats in <xref target="RFC3971" sectionFormat="of" section="9.2.1"/> apply. AP-ND counters the threats on NS(EARO) messages by requiring that the NDPSO and CIPO be present in these solicitations.</dd>
            <dt>Duplicate Address Detection DoS Attack:</dt><dd>
		       Inside the LLN, duplicate addresses are sorted out using the ROVR. A different ROVR for the same Registered Address entails a rejection of the second registration <xref target="RFC8505"/>. DADs coming from the backbone network are not forwarded over the LLN to provide some protection against DoS attacks inside the resource-constrained part of the network. However, the EARO is present in the NS/NA messages exchanged over the backbone network. This protects against misinterpreting node movement as a duplication and enables the Backbone Routers to determine which subnet has the most recent registration <xref target="RFC8505"/> and is thus the best candidate to validate the registration <xref target="RFC8929"/>.
            </dd>
           <dt>Router Solicitation and Advertisement Attacks:</dt><dd>
		        This specification does not change the protection of RS and RA, which can still be protected by SEND.</dd>
            <dt>Replay Attacks:</dt><dd>
		        Nonces should never repeat but they do not need to be unpredictable for secure operation. Using nonces (NonceLR and NonceLN) generated by both the 6LR and 6LN ensures a contributory behavior that provides an efficient protection against replay attacks of the challenge/response flow. The quality of the protection by a random nonce depends on the random number generator.
            </dd>
            <dt>Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack:</dt><dd>
		        A rogue node that can access the L2 network may form many addresses and register them using AP-ND. The perimeter of the attack is all the 6LRs in range of the attacker. The 6LR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> protect itself against overflows and reject excessive registration with a status code of 2 "Neighbor Cache Full". This effectively blocks another (honest) 6LN from registering to the same 6LR, but the 6LN may register to other 6LRs that are in its range but not in that of the attacker.

    <section><name>Related to 6LoWPAN ND</name>
    	<t>
    		The threats and mitigations discussed in 6LoWPAN ND
		<xref target="RFC6775"/> <xref target="RFC8505"/> also
		apply here, in particular, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against the registry at the 6LR or 6LBR.

        </t><t>
            Secure ND <xref target="RFC3971"/> forces the IPv6 address to be cryptographic since it integrates the CGA as the IID in the IPv6 address. In contrast, this specification saves about 1 KB in every NS/NA message. Also, this specification separates the cryptographic identifier from the registered IPv6 address so that a node can have more than one IPv6 address protected by the same cryptographic identifier.
        </t><t>
            With this specification, the 6LN can freely form its IPv6 address(es) in any fashion, thereby enabling either 6LoWPAN compression for IPv6 addresses that are derived from L2 addresses or temporary addresses that cannot be compressed, e.g., formed pseudorandomly and released in relatively short cycles for privacy reasons <xref target="RFC8064"/><xref target="RFC8065"/>.
        </t><t>
            This specification provides added protection for addresses that are obtained following due procedure <xref target="RFC8505"/> but does not constrain the way the addresses are formed or the number of addresses that are used in parallel by a same entity. An attacker may still perform a DoS attack against the registry at the 6LR or 6LBR or attempt to deplete the pool of available addresses at L2 or L3.

    	</t>
    </section>
	<section><name>Compromised 6LR</name>
    	<t>
        This specification distributes the challenge and its validation at the edge of the network, between the 6LN and its 6LR. This protects against DoS attacks targeted at that central 6LBR. This also saves back-and-forth exchanges across a potentially large and constrained network.
       </t><t>
        The downside is that the 6LBR needs to trust the 6LR to perform the checking adequately, and the communication between the 6LR and the 6LBR must be protected to avoid tampering with the result of the validation.

       </t><t>
       If a 6LR is compromised, and provided that it knows the ROVR field used by the real owner of the address, the 6LR may pretend that the owner has moved, is now attached to it, and has successfully passed the Crypto-ID validation. The 6LR may then attract and inject traffic at will on behalf of that address, or let an attacker take ownership of the address.
		</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="sec-col"><name>ROVR Collisions</name>
    <t>

    	A collision of ROVRs (i.e., the Crypto-ID in this specification) is possible, but it is a rare event. Assuming that the hash used for calculating the Crypto-ID is a well-behaved cryptographic hash, and, thus, random collisions are the only ones possible, if n = 2<sup>k</sup> is the maximum number of hash values (i.e., a k-bit hash) and p is the number of nodes, then (assuming one Crypto-ID per node) the formula 1 - e<sup>-p<sup>2</sup>/(2n)</sup> provides an approximation of the probability that there is at least one collision (birthday paradox).
         </t>

      <t>
        If the Crypto-ID is 64 bits (the least possible size allowed), the chance of a collision is 0.01% for a network of 66 million nodes. Moreover, the collision is only relevant when this happens within one stub network (6LBR). In the case of such a collision, an honest node might accidentally claim the Registered Address of another legitimate node (with the same Crypto-ID). To prevent such rare events, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that nodes do not derive the address being registered from the ROVR.
    	</t>
    </section>
   	<section><name>Implementation Attacks</name>
    	<t> The signature schemes referenced in this specification comply with NIST <xref target="FIPS186-4"/> or Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) standards <xref target="RFC8032"/> and offer strong algorithmic security at roughly a 128-bit security level. These signature schemes use elliptic curves that either were specifically designed with exception-free and constant-time arithmetic in mind <xref target="RFC7748"/> or have extensive implementation experience of resistance
		to timing attacks <xref target="FIPS186-4"/>.

        </t>
        <t>
        However, careless implementations of the signing operations could nevertheless leak information on private keys. For example,
		there are micro-architectural side channel attacks that implementors should be aware of <xref target="breaking-ed25519"/>.
        Implementors should be particularly aware that
		a secure implementation of Ed25519 requires a protected implementation of the hash function SHA-512, whereas this is not required with implementations of the hash function
		SHA-256 used with ECDSA256 and ECDSA25519.
		</t>
    </section>
	<section><name>Cross-Algorithm and Cross-Protocol Attacks</name>
    	<t>
        The key pair used in this specification can be self-generated, and the public key does not need to be exchanged, e.g., through certificates, with a third party before it is used.
        </t>
        <t>
        New key pairs can be formed for new registrations if the node desires. However, the same private key <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be reused with more than one instantiation of the signature scheme in this specification. Also, the same private key <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used for anything other than computing NDPSO signatures per this specification.
		</t>
		<t> ECDSA shall be used strictly as specified in <xref target="FIPS186-4"/>. In particular, each signing operation of ECDSA <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use randomly generated ephemeral private keys and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> reuse the ephemeral private key k across signing operations. This precludes the use of deterministic ECDSA without a random input for the determination of k, which is deemed dangerous for the intended applications this document aims to serve.</t>
    </section>

	<section><name>Public Key Validation</name>
	<t>Public keys contained in the CIPO field (which are used for signature verification) shall be verified to be correctly formed, by checking that this public key is indeed a
	point of the elliptic curve indicated by the Crypto-Type and that this point does have the proper order.
    </t>
    <t>
        For points used with the signature scheme Ed25519, one <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> check
	that this point is not in the small subgroup (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-lwig-curve-representations" sectionFormat="of" section="B.1"/>); for points used with the signature scheme
	ECDSA (i.e., both ECDSA256 and ECDSA25519), one <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> check that the point has the same order as the base point of the curve in question. This is commonly called
	"full public key validation" (again, see <xref target="I-D.ietf-lwig-curve-representations" sectionFormat="of" section="B.1"/>). </t>
	</section>


	<section><name>Correlating Registrations</name>
    	<t>
          The ROVR field in the EARO introduced in <xref target="RFC8505"/> extends the EUI-64 field of the ARO defined in <xref target="RFC6775"/>. One of the drawbacks of using an EUI-64 as ROVR is that an attacker that is aware of the registrations can correlate traffic for the same 6LN across multiple addresses. <xref target="RFC8505" sectionFormat="of" section="3"/> indicates that the ROVR and the address being registered are decoupled. A 6LN may use the same ROVR for multiple registrations or a different ROVR per registration, and the IID must not be derived from the ROVR. In theory, different 6LNs could use the same ROVR as long as they do not attempt to register the same address.
    	</t>
    	<t>
          The modifier used in the computation of the Crypto-ID enables a 6LN to build different Crypto-IDs for different addresses with the same key pair. Using that facility improves the privacy of the 6LN at the expense of storage in the 6LR, which will need to store multiple CIPOs that contain the same public key. Note that if an attacker gains access to the 6LR, then the modifier alone does not provide protection, and the 6LN would need to generate different key pairs and link-layer addresses in an attempt to obfuscate its multiple ownership.

<section anchor="ps"><name>Requirements Addressed in This Document</name>
    <t>
	     In this section, the requirements of a secure Neighbor Discovery protocol for LLNs are stated.
	     </t><ul spacing="normal">
	     <li>
	      The protocol <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be based on the Neighbor Discovery Optimization for the LLN protocol defined in <xref target="RFC6775"/>. RFC 6775 utilizes optimizations such as host-initiated interactions for sleeping resource-constrained hosts and the elimination of multicast address resolution.
	     </li>
	     <li>
	       New options to be added to Neighbor Solicitation messages <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> lead to small packet sizes, especially compared with existing protocols such as SEND. Smaller packet sizes facilitate low-power transmission by resource-constrained nodes on lossy links.
	     </li>
	     <li>
	       The registration mechanism <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be extensible to other LLN links and not be limited to IEEE 802.15.4 only. LLN links for which a 6lo "IPv6 over foo" specification exist, as well as low-power Wi-Fi, <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be supported.
	     </li>
	     <li>
	       As part of this protocol, a mechanism to compute a unique identifier should be provided with the capability to form a Link Local Address that <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be unique at least within the LLN connected to a 6LBR.
       </li>
	     <li>
	       The Address Registration Option used in the ND registration <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be extended to carry the relevant forms of the
	       unique identifier.
	     </li>
	     <li>
	       The Neighbor Discovery should specify the formation of a site-local address that follows the security recommendations from <xref target="RFC7217"/>.
	     </li>
	     </ul>

	<section><name>Signature Schemes</name>

	<t> The signature scheme ECDSA256 corresponding to Crypto-Type 0 is ECDSA, as specified in <xref target="FIPS186-4"/>, instantiated with the NIST prime curve P-256,
	as specified in Appendix D.1.2 of <xref target="FIPS186-4"/>, and the hash function SHA-256, as specified in <xref target="RFC6234"/>, where points of this NIST curve are
	represented as points of a short-Weierstrass curve (see <xref target="FIPS186-4"/>) and are encoded as octet strings in most-significant-bit first (msb) and
	most-significant-byte first (MSB) order. The signature itself consists of two integers (r and s), which are each encoded as fixed-size octet strings in MSB and msb order. For further details, see <xref target="FIPS186-4"/> for ECDSA, see <xref target="weirepr"/> for the encoding of public keys, and see
        <xref target="bitrepr"/> for signature encoding.</t>

	<t> The signature scheme Ed25519 corresponding to Crypto-Type 1 is EdDSA, as specified in <xref target="RFC8032"/>, instantiated with the Montgomery curve Curve25519, as
	specified in <xref target="RFC7748"/>, and the hash function SHA-512, as specified in <xref target="RFC6234"/>, where points of this Montgomery curve are
	represented as points of the corresponding twisted Edwards
	curve Edwards25519 (see <xref target="curves"/>) and are
	encoded as octet strings in least-significant-bit first (lsb)
	and least-significant-byte first (LSB) order. The signature itself consists of a bit string that encodes a point of this twisted Edwards curve, in compressed format, and an
	integer encoded in LSB and lsb order. For details on EdDSA and the encoding of public keys and signatures, see the
	specification of pure Ed25519 in <xref target="RFC8032"/>.</t>

	<t> The signature scheme ECDSA25519 corresponding to Crypto-Type 2 is ECDSA, as specified in <xref target="FIPS186-4"/>, instantiated with the Montgomery curve
	Curve25519, as specified in <xref target="RFC7748"/>, and the hash function SHA-256, as specified in <xref target="RFC6234"/>, where points of this Montgomery
	curve are represented as points of the corresponding short-Weierstrass curve Wei25519 (see <xref target="curves"/>) and are encoded as octet strings in
	MSB and msb order. The signature itself consists of a bit string that encodes two integers (r and s), which are each encoded as fixed-size
	octet strings in MSB and msb order. For further details, see <xref target="FIPS186-4"/> for ECDSA, see <xref target="weirepr"/> for the encoding of
	public keys, and see <xref target="bitrepr"/> for signature encoding.</t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="bitrepr"><name>Representation of ECDSA Signatures</name>
	<t> With ECDSA, each signature is an ordered pair (r, s) of integers <xref target="FIPS186-4"/>, where each integer is represented as a 32-octet string according to the
	FieldElement-to-OctetString conversion rules in <xref target="SEC1"/> and where the ordered pair of integers is represented as the right concatenation of these representation
	values (thereby resulting in a 64-octet string). The inverse operation checks that the signature is a 64-octet string and represents the left-side and right-side halves of this
	string (each a 32-octet string) as the integers r and s, respectively, using the OctetString-to-FieldElement conversion rules in <xref target="SEC1"/>. In both cases, the
	field with these conversion rules is the set of integers modulo n, where n is the (prime) order of the base point of the curve in question. (For elliptic curve nomenclature, see
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-lwig-curve-representations" sectionFormat="of" section="B.1"></xref>.)
	</t></section>

	<section anchor="weirepr"><name>Representation of Public Keys Used with ECDSA</name>
	<t> ECDSA is specified to be used with elliptic curves in short-Weierstrass form. Each point of such a curve is represented as an octet string using the Elliptic-Curve-Point-to-Octet-String
        conversion rules in <xref target="SEC1"/>, where point compression may be enabled (which is indicated by the leftmost octet of this representation). The inverse
	operation converts an octet string to a point of this curve using the Octet-String-to-Elliptic-Curve-Point conversion rules in <xref target="SEC1"/>, whereby the point is rejected
	if this is the so-called point at infinity. (This is the case if the input to this inverse operation is an octet string of length 1.) </t>
	</section>
	<section anchor="curves"><name>Alternative Representations of Curve25519</name>
	<t> The elliptic curve Curve25519, as specified in <xref target="RFC7748"/>, is a so-called Montgomery curve. Each point of this curve can also be represented as a point
	of a twisted Edwards curve or as a point of an elliptic curve in short-Weierstrass form, via a coordinate transformation (a so-called isomorphic mapping). The parameters of the
	Montgomery curve and the corresponding isomorphic curves in twisted Edwards curve and short-Weierstrass form are as indicated below. Here, the domain parameters of the Montgomery
	curve Curve25519 and of the twisted Edwards curve Edwards25519 are as specified in <xref target="RFC7748"/>; the domain parameters of the elliptic curve Wei25519 in
	short-Weierstrass form comply with Section 6.1.1 of <xref target="FIPS186-4"/>. For further details on these curves and on the coordinate transformations referenced above, see
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-lwig-curve-representations"/>.  </t>
