    <abstract>
      <t>Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is now reaching technological
      maturity after many years of fundamental research and experimentation. 
	  This document provides a number of deployment considerations in the
	  interest of helping the ICN community move forward to the next step
	  of live deployments. First, the major deployment configurations for
	  ICN are described, including the key overlay and underlay approaches.
	  Then, proposed deployment migration paths are outlined to address
	  major practical issues, such as network and application migration.
	  Next, selected ICN trial experiences are summarized. Finally,
	  protocol areas that require further standardization are identified
	  to facilitate future interoperable ICN deployments. This document is
	  a product of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group
	  (ICNRG).

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The ICNRG charter identifies deployment guidelines as an important
      topic area for the ICN community. Specifically, the charter states 
	  that defining concrete migration paths for ICN deployments that
	  avoid forklift upgrades and defining practical ICN interworking
	  configurations 
	  with the existing Internet paradigm are key topic areas that
	  require further investigation <xref target="ICNRGCharter"
	  format="default"/>. Also, it is well 
	  understood that results and conclusions from any mid- to large-scale
	  ICN experiments in the live Internet will also provide useful
	  guidance for deployments.   
      </t>
      <t>So far, outside of some preliminary investigations, such as <xref
      target="I-D.paik-icn-deployment-considerations" format="default"/>,
      there has not been much  
	  progress on this topic. This document attempts to fill some of
	  these gaps by defining clear deployment configurations for ICN and
	  associated
	  migration pathways for these configurations. Also, selected
	  deployment trial experiences of ICN technology are summarized.
	  Recommendations 
	  are also made for potential future IETF standardization of key
	  protocol functionality that will facilitate interoperable ICN
	  deployments going forward.  
      </t>
      <t>The major configurations of possible ICN deployments are identified
      in this document as (1) Clean-slate ICN replacement of existing Internet
      infrastructure, 
	  (2) ICN-as-an-Overlay, (3) ICN-as-an-Underlay, (4) ICN-as-a-Slice,
	  and (5) Composite-ICN. Existing ICN trial systems primarily fall 
	  under the ICN-as-an-Overlay, ICN-as-an-Underlay, and Composite-ICN
	  configurations. Each of these deployment configurations have their
	  respective strengths and weaknesses. 
	  This document will aim to provide guidance for current and future
	  members of the ICN community when they consider deployment of ICN
	  technologies.

      <name>Deployment Configurations</name>
      <t>In this section, we present various deployment options for ICN.
      These are presented as "configurations" that allow for studying these
      options 
	further. While this document will outline experiences with a number of
	these configurations (in <xref target="sec_trial_experiences"
	format="default"/>), we will 
	not provide an in-depth technical or commercial evaluation for any of
	them -- for this, we refer to existing literature in this space, such as
	<xref target="Tateson" format="default"/>. 
      </t>
      <section anchor="sec_replacements" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Clean-Slate ICN</name>
        <t>ICN has often been described as a "clean-slate" approach with the
	goal to renew or replace the complete IP infrastructure of the 
		Internet. 
		As such, existing routing hardware and
		ancillary services, such as existing applications that are
		typically tied directly to the TCP/IP stack, are not
		taken for granted. For instance, a Clean-slate ICN deployment
		would see existing IP routers being replaced by ICN-specific
		forwarding and routing elements, such as NFD <xref
		target="NFD" format="default"/>, CCNx routers <xref
		target="Jacobson" format="default"/>, or Publish-Subscribe
		Internet Technology (PURSUIT) forwarding nodes <xref
		target="IEEE_Communications" format="default"/>. 
</t>
        <t>While such clean-slate replacement could be seen as exclusive for
	ICN deployments, some ICN approaches (e.g., <xref target="POINT"
	format="default"/>) 
		also rely on the deployment of general infrastructure
		upgrades, in this case, SDN switches. Different proposals have
		been made for various 
		ICN approaches to enable the operation over an SDN transport
		<xref target="Reed" format="default"/> <xref target="CONET"
		format="default"/> <xref target="C_FLOW" format="default"/>. 
</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec_overlay" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>ICN-as-an-Overlay</name>
        <t>Similar to other significant changes to the Internet routing
	fabric, particularly the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 or 
		the introduction of IP multicast, this deployment
		configuration foresees the creation of an ICN overlay. Note
		that this overlay 
		approach is sometimes, informally, also referred to as a
		tunneling approach. 
                The overlay approach can be implemented directly 
		(e.g., ICN-over-UDP), as described in <xref target="CCNx_UDP"
		format="default"/>. Alternatively, the overlay can be
		accomplished via ICN-in-L2-in-IP as in <xref
		target="IEEE_Communications" format="default"/>, which
		describes a recursive layering process. Another approach used
		in the Network of Information (NetInf) is to define a
		convergence layer to map NetInf semantics to HTTP <xref
		target="I-D.kutscher-icnrg-netinf-proto" format="default"/>.   
		Finally, <xref target="Overlay_ICN" format="default"/>
		describes an incremental approach to deploying an ICN
		architecture particularly well suited to  
		SDN-based networks by also segregating ICN user- and
		control-plane traffic.  
</t>
        <t>However, regardless of the flavor, the overlay approach results in
	islands of ICN deployments over existing IP-based infrastructure. 
		Furthermore, these ICN islands are typically connected to each
		other via ICN/IP tunnels. In certain scenarios, this requires 
		interoperability between existing IP routing protocols (e.g.,
		OSPF, RIP, or IS-IS) and ICN-based ones. ICN-as-an-Overlay can be
		deployed 
		over the IP infrastructure in either edge or core networks.
		This overlay approach is thus very attractive for ICN
		experimentation 
		and testing, as it allows rapid and easy deployment of ICN over
		existing IP networks.   
</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec_underlay" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>ICN-as-an-Underlay</name>
        <t>Proposals, such as <xref target="POINT" format="default"/> and <xref
	target="White" format="default"/>, outline the deployment option of
	using an ICN underlay that would 
		integrate with existing (external) IP-based networks by
		deploying application-layer gateways at appropriate locations.
		The main reasons for 
		such a configuration option is the introduction of ICN
		technology in given islands (e.g., inside a CDN or edge IoT
		network) to reap the benefits 
		of native ICN, in terms of underlying multicast delivery,
		mobility support, fast indirection due to location
		independence, in-network computing, 
		and possibly more. The underlay approach thus results in
		islands of native ICN deployments that are connected to the
		rest of the Internet 
		through protocol conversion gateways or proxies. Routing
		domains are strictly separated. Outside of the ICN island,
		normal IP routing protocols 
		apply. Within the ICN island, ICN-based routing schemes
		apply. The gateways transfer the semantic content of the
		messages (i.e., IP packet payload) between the two routing
		domains. 
</t>
        <section anchor="sec_application_gateways" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Edge Network</name>
          <t>Native ICN networks may be located at the edge of the network
	  where the introduction of new network 
		architectures and protocols is easier in so-called greenfield
		deployments. In this context, ICN is an attractive option 
		for scenarios, such as IoT <xref target="I-D.irtf-icnrg-icniot"
		format="default"/>. The integration with the current IP
		protocol suite takes place at an  
		application gateway/proxy at the edge network boundary, e.g.,
		translating incoming CoAP request/response transactions 
		<xref target="RFC7252" format="default"/> into ICN message
		exchanges or vice versa. 
</t>
          <t>The work in <xref target="VSER" format="default"/> positions ICN
	  as an edge service gateway driven by a generalized ICN-based service
	  orchestration 
		system with its own compute and network virtualization
		controllers to manage an ICN infrastructure. The platform also
		offers service discovery 
		capabilities to enable user applications to discover
		appropriate ICN service gateways. To exemplify a
		scenario in a use case, the <xref target="VSER" format="default"/> platform 
		shows the realization of a multi-party audio/video
		conferencing service over such an edge cloud deployment of ICN
		routers realized over commodity hardware platforms.  This platform has also been extended to
		offer seamless mobility as a service that <xref
		target="VSER-Mob" format="default"/> features. 
          </t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sec_http_ip" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Core Network</name>
          <t>In this suboption, a core network would utilize edge-based
	  protocol mapping onto the native ICN underlay. For instance, <xref
	  target="POINT" format="default"/> proposes 
		to map HTTP transactions or some other IP-based transactions,
		such as CoAP, directly onto an ICN-based message
		exchange. This mapping is realized at the
		NAP, for example, in access points or customer premise
		equipment, which, in turn, provides a standard IP interface to
		existing user devices. Thus, the NAP provides the apparent
		perception of an IP-based core network toward any external
		peering network.  
</t>
          <t>The work in <xref target="White" format="default"/> proposes a
	  similar deployment configuration. There, the goal is to use ICN for
	  content distribution within CDN 
		server farms. Specifically, the protocol mapping is realized
		at the ingress of the server farm where the HTTP-based
		retrieval request is served, while the 
		response is delivered through a suitable egress node
		translation.

        <t> The objective of network slicing <xref target="NGMN-5G"
	format="default"/> is to multiplex a general pool of compute, storage,
	and bandwidth resources among multiple service networks with exclusive SLA
	requirements on transport and compute-level QoS and security. This is
	enabled through NFV and SDN technology functions that enable
	functional decomposition (hence, modularity, independent scalability 
        of control, and/or the user-plane functions), agility, and service-driven
	programmability. Network slicing is often associated with 5G but is
	clearly not limited to such systems. However, from a 5G perspective,
	the definition of slicing includes access networks enabling dynamic
	slicing of the spectrum resources among various services, hence naturally
	extending itself to end points and cloud resources across
	multiple domains, to offer end-to-end guarantees. 
                Once instantiated, these slices  
		could include a mix of connectivity services (e.g.,
		LTE-as-a-service), Over-the-Top (OTT) services (e.g., VoD), or
		other IoT services through composition of a group of virtual
		and/or physical network functions at the control-, user-, and
		service-plane levels. Such a framework
		can also be used to realize ICN slices with its own control
		and forwarding plane, over which one or more end-user 
		services can be delivered <xref target="NGMN-Network-Slicing"
		format="default"/>.</t> 
        <t>The 5G next generation architecture <xref target="fiveG-23501"
	format="default"/> provides the flexibility to deploy the
	ICN-as-a-Slice over either the edge (RAN) or mobile core network; otherwise,
	the ICN-as-a-Slice may be deployed end to end. Further discussions on
	extending the architecture presented in <xref target="fiveG-23501"
	format="default"/>  and the corresponding procedures in <xref
	target="fiveG-23502" format="default"/>  to support ICN has been
	provided in <xref target="I-D.ravi-icnrg-5gc-icn"
	format="default"/>. 


	The document elaborates on two possible approaches to
	enable ICN: (1) as an edge service using the local data network (LDN)
		feature in 5G using User Plane Function (UPF) classification
		functions to fast 
		handover to the ICN forwarder and (2) as a native deployment
		using the non-IP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) support that would allow new network
		layer PDU to be handed over to ICN UPFs collocated with the
		Generation NodeB (gNB) functions without invoking any IP
		functions. While the 
		former deployment would still rely on 3GPP-based mobility
		functions, the later would 
		allow mobility to be handled natively by ICN. However, both
		these deployment modes should benefit from other ICN features,
		such as in-network caching and computing. Associated with this
		ICN user-plane enablement, control-plane extensions are also 
		proposed leveraging 5th Generation Core Network (5GC)'s
		interface to other application functions (AFs) 
		to allow new network service-level programmability. Such a  
		generalized network slicing framework should be able to offer
		service slices over both IP and ICN. Coupled
		with the view of ICN functions as being "service
		function chaining" <xref target="RFC7665" format="default"/>, an ICN
		deployment within such 
		a slice could also be realized within the emerging control
		plane that is targeted for adoption in future 
		(e.g., 5G mobile) network deployments. Finally, it should be
		noted that ICN is not creating the network slice but 
		instead that the slice is created to run a 5G-ICN instance
	<xref target="Ravindran" format="default"/>.</t> 
        <t>At the level of the specific technologies involved, such as ONAP
	<xref target="ONAP" format="default"/> (which can be used to orchestrate
	slices), 
		the 5G-ICN slice requires compatibility, for instance, at the
		level of the forwarding/data plane depending on if it is
		realized as 
		an overlay or using programmable data planes. With SDN
		emerging for new network deployments, some ICN approaches will
		need to 
		integrate as a data-plane forwarding function with SDN, as
		briefly discussed in <xref target="sec_replacements"
		format="default"/>. Further 
		cross-domain ICN slices can also be realized using frameworks,
		such as <xref target="ONAP" format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>We now focus on the various migration paths that will have importance

	as: 
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>application providers</li>
        <li>ISPs and service providers, both as core and access network

	to content delivery)</li> 
        <li>end-device manufacturers and users</li>
      </ul>
      <t>
	Our focus is on technological aspects of such migration. Economic or

	<xref target="Techno_Economic" format="default"/>, and <xref

</t>
      <section anchor="sec_apps_service" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Application and Service Migration</name>
        <t>The Internet supports a multitude of applications and services
	using the many protocols defined over the packet-level IP
	service. HTTP provides 
		one convergence point for these services with many web
		development frameworks based on the semantics provided by it. 
		In recent years, even services such as video delivery have
		been migrating from the traditional RTP-over-UDP delivery to
		the various HTTP-level
		streaming solutions, such as DASH <xref target="DASH"
		format="default"/> and others. Nonetheless, many non-HTTP
		services exist, all of which need consideration 
		when migrating from the IP-based Internet to an ICN-based one.
</t>
        <t>The underlay deployment configuration option presented in <xref
	target="sec_underlay" format="default"/> aims at providing some level
	of compatibility
		to the existing ecosystem through a proxy-based message flow
		mapping mechanism (e.g., mapping of existing HTTP/TCP/IP
		message flows to 
		HTTP/ICN message flows). A related approach of mapping TCP/IP
		to TCP/ICN message flows is described in <xref
		target="Moiseenko" format="default"/>. 
		Another approach described in <xref target="Marchal"
		format="default"/> uses HTTP/NDN gateways and focuses, in
		particular, on the right strategy to map 
		HTTP to NDN to guarantee a high level of compatibility with
		HTTP while enabling an efficient caching of data in the ICN
		island. The choice 
		of approach is a design decision based on how to configure the
		protocol stack. For example, the approach 
		described in <xref target="Moiseenko" format="default"/>
		carries the TCP layer into the ICN underlay, while the <xref
		target="Marchal" format="default"/> approach  
		terminates both HTTP and TCP at the edge of the ICN underlay
		and maps these functionalities onto existing ICN
		functionalities. 
</t>
        <t>Alternatively, ICN-as-an-Overlay (<xref target="sec_overlay"
	format="default"/>) and ICN-as-a-Slice (<xref
	target="sec_icn_slice" format="default"/>) allow for the 
		introduction of the full capabilities of ICN through new
		application/service interfaces, as well as operations in the
		network. With that, these 
		approaches of deployment are likely to aim at introducing new
		application/services capitalizing on those ICN capabilities,
		such as in-network 
		multicast and/or caching.
</t>
        <t>Finally, <xref target="I-D.irtf-icnrg-icn-lte-4g"
	format="default"/> outlines a dual-stack end-user device approach that
	is applicable for all deployment 
		configurations. Specifically, it introduces middleware layers
		(called the TCL) in the device that will dynamically adapt
		existing applications 
		to either an underlying ICN protocol stack or standard IP
		protocol stack. This involves end device 
		signaling with the network to determine which protocol stack
		instance and associated middleware adaptation layers to
		utilize for a given application transaction.

        <t>A significant number of services and applications are devoted to

		and many others. CDNs are deployed to assist these services
		through localizing the content requests and therefore reducing

        <t>Edge networks often see the deployment of novel network-level
	technology, e.g., in the space of IoT. For many years, such
	IoT deployments have relied, 
		and often still do, on proprietary protocols for reasons, such
		as increased efficiency, lack of standardization incentives,
		and others. 


		Utilizing the 
		underlay deployment configuration in <xref

		application gateways/proxies can integrate such edge

		as oneM2M <xref target="oneM2M" format="default"/> or others. 
</t>
        <t>Another area of increased edge network innovation is that of mobile
	(access) networks, particularly in the context of the 5G mobile
	networks. 

	Network softwarization (using technologies like service
	orchestration frameworks leveraging NFV and SDN concepts) are
	now common in access networks and other network segments.
	Therefore, the ICN-as-a-Slice deployment configuration in
	<xref target="sec_icn_slice" format="default"/> provides a
	suitable migration path for the integration of non-IP-based
	edge networks into the overall system by virtue of
	realizing the relevant (ICN) protocols in an access network
	slice.
</t>
        <t>With the advent of SDN and NFV capabilities, so-called campus or
	site-specific deployments could see the introduction of ICN islands at
	the edge for scenarios such as gaming or deployments based on Augmented Reality
	(AR) / Virtual Reality (VR), e.g., smart cities or

		The UMOBILE architecture integrates the principles of DTN and
		ICN in a common framework to support edge computing and 
		mobile opportunistic wireless environments (e.g.,
		post-disaster scenarios and remote areas). The UMOBILE
		architecture 
		<xref target="UMOBILE-2" format="default"/> was developed on
		top of the NDN framework by following the overlay deployment
		configuration of 
		<xref target="sec_overlay" format="default"/>. UMOBILE aims to
		extend Internet functionally by combining ICN and DTN
		technologies. 
</t>
          <t>One of the key aspects of UMOBILE was the extension of the NDN
	  framework to locate network services (e.g., mobility management and 
		intermittent connectivity support) and user services (e.g.,
		pervasive content management) as close as possible to the
		end users to optimize bandwidth 
		utilization and resource management. Another aspect was the
		evolution of the NDN framework to operate in challenging
		wireless networks, namely in emergency 
		scenarios <xref target="UMOBILE-3" format="default"/> and
		environments with intermittent connectivity. To achieve this,
		the NDN framework was leveraged with a 
		new messaging application called Oi! <xref target="UMOBILE-4"
		format="default"/> <xref target="UMOBILE-5" format="default"/>,
		which supports intermittent wireless networking. 
		UMOBILE also implements a new data-centric wireless routing
		protocol, DABBER <xref target="UMOBILE-6" format="default"/>
		<xref target="I-D.mendes-icnrg-dabber" format="default"/>,
		which was 
		designed based on data reachability metrics that take
		availability of adjacent wireless nodes and different data
		sources into consideration. The contextual awareness of the
		wireless network operation is obtained via a machine-learning
		agent running within the wireless nodes <xref
		target="UMOBILE-7" format="default"/>.

</t>
          <t>The consortium has completed several ICN deployment trials. In a
	  post-disaster scenario trial <xref target="UMOBILE-8"
	  format="default"/>, 
		a special DTN face was created to provide reachability to
		remote areas where there is no typical Internet 
		connection. Another trial was the ICN deployment over the
		"Guifi.net" community network in the Barcelona region. This
		trial 
		focused on the evaluation of an ICN edge computing platform,
		called PiCasso <xref target="UMOBILE-9" format="default"/>. In
		this  
		trial, ten (10) Raspberry Pis were deployed across Barcelona
		to create an ICN overlay network on top of the existing IP
		routing protocol 
		(e.g., qMp routing). This trial showed that ICN can play a key
		role in improving data delivery QoS and
		reducing the traffic in intermittent connectivity environments
		(e.g., wireless community network). A third trial in Italy was
		focused  
		on displaying the capability of the UMOBILE architecture to
		reach disconnected areas and assist responsible authorities in

	  of an NDN system adapted specifically for a wireless IoT scenario.
	  The trial was run with 
		60 nodes distributed over several multistory buildings in a
		university campus environment. The NDN protocols were
		optimized to run directly 
		over 6LoWPAN wireless link layers. The performance of the
		NDN-based IoT system was then compared to an equivalent system
		running standard IP-based IoT protocols. It was found that
		the NDN-based IoT 
		system was superior in several respects, including in terms of
		energy consumption and 
		for RAM and ROM footprints <xref target="Baccelli"
		format="default"/> <xref target="Anastasiades"
		format="default"/>. For example, the binary file size
		reductions for 
		NDN protocol stack versus standard IP-based IoT protocol stack
		on given devices were up to 60% less for ROM size and up to
		80% less for RAM size.

		The project aims to run NDN over virtualized NFV

</t>
          <t>The data plane relies on an HTTP/NDN gateway <xref

	  transports it in an optimized way over NDN to 
		 benefit from the properties of the NDN island (i.e., by
		 mapping HTTP semantics to NDN semantics within the
		 NDN island). The testbed carries 
		 real Web traffic of users and has been currently evaluated
		 with the top 1000 most popular websites. The users only
		 need to set the gateway 
		 as the web proxy. The control plane relies on a central

        <t>In summary, there have been significant trials over the years with
	all the major ICN protocol flavors (e.g., CCNx, NDN, and POINT) using both 
		the ICN-as-an-Overlay and ICN-as-an-Underlay deployment
		configurations. The major limitations of the trials include
		the fact that only a limited 
		number of applications have been tested. However, the tested
		applications include both native ICN and existing IP-based
		applications 
		(e.g., videoconferencing and IPTV). Another limitation of
	the trials is that all of them involve less than 1k users.</t> 
        <t>Huawei and China Unicom have just started trials of the ICN-as-a-Slice configuration to demonstrate 
		ICN features of security, mobility, and bandwidth efficiency
		over a wired infrastructure using videoconferencing 
		as the application scenario <xref target="Chakraborti"
		format="default"/>; also, this prototype has been extended to
	demonstrate this over a 5G-NR access.</t> 
        <t>The Clean-slate ICN approach has obviously never been in trials, as
	complete replacement of Internet 
		infrastructure (e.g., existing applications, TCP/IP protocol
	stack, IP routers, etc.) is no longer considered a viable
	alternative.</t> 
        <t>Finally, Hybrid ICN is a Composite-ICN approach that offers an
	interesting alternative, as it allows ICN semantics to be embedded in
	standard 
		IPv6 packets so the packets can be routed through either IP
		routers or Hybrid ICN routers. Note that some other trials,
		such as the 
		DOCTOR testbed (<xref target="sec_Doctor" format="default"/>),
		could also be characterized as a Composite-ICN approach,
		because it contains both ICN gateways 
		(as in ICN-as-an-Underlay) and virtualized infrastructure (as
		in ICN-as-a-Slice). However, for the DOCTOR testbed, we have
		chosen to characterize 
		it as an ICN-as-an-Underlay configuration because that is a
		dominant characteristic.

      describes key ICN principles and technical research topics. As the
      title suggests,  
		<xref target="RFC7927" format="default"/> is research oriented
		without a specific focus on deployment or standardization
		issues. This section addresses this 
		open area by identifying key protocol functionality that
		may be relevant for further standardization effort in
		the IETF.
		The focus is specifically 
		on identifying protocols that will facilitate future
		interoperable ICN deployments correlating to the scenarios
		identified in the deployment 
		migration paths in <xref target="sec_migration"
		format="default"/>. The identified list of potential protocol
		functionality is not exhaustive. 

</t>
      <section anchor="sec_standards_apps" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Protocols for Application and Service Migration</name>
        <t>End-user applications and services need a standardized approach to
	trigger ICN transactions. For example, in Internet and web
	applications 
		today, there are established socket APIs, communication
		paradigms (such as REST), common libraries, and best
		practices. We see a need to study 
		application requirements in an ICN environment further and, at
		the same time, develop new APIs and best practices that can

</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec_standards_cdn" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Protocols for Content Delivery Network Migration</name>
        <t>A key issue in CDNs is to quickly find a location of a copy of the
	object requested by an end user. In ICN, a Named Data Object (NDO) is 
		typically defined by its name. <xref target="RFC6920"
		format="default"/> defines a mechanism that is suitable for
		static naming of ICN data objects. Other 
		ways of encoding and representing ICN names have been
		described in <xref target="RFC8609" format="default"/> and 
		<xref target="RFC8569" format="default"/>. Naming dynamically
		generated data requires different approaches(e.g.,
		hash-digest-based names would normally not work), and there is
		a lack of established conventions and standards.  

        </t>
        <t>Another CDN issue for ICN is related to multicast distribution of
	content.
                Existing CDNs have started using multicast mechanisms for 
		certain cases, such as for broadcasting streaming TV.  However, as
		discussed in <xref target="sec_point_rife" format="default"/>,
		certain ICN approaches provide 
		substantial improvements over IP multicast, such as the
		implicit support for multicast retrieval of content in all ICN
		flavors.		 
</t>
        <t>Caching is an implicit feature in many ICN architectures that can
	improve performance and availability in several scenarios. The ICN 
		in-network caching can augment managed CDN and improve its
		performance. The details of the interplay between ICN caching
		and managed CDN need further consideration.

      <section anchor="sec_standards_edge_core" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Protocols for Edge and Core Network Migration</name>
        <t>ICN provides the potential to redesign current edge and core
	network computing approaches. Leveraging ICN's inherent security and
	its ability 
		to make name data and dynamic computation results available
		independent of location can enable a lightweight insertion
		of traffic  
		into the network without relying on redirection of DNS
		requests. For this, proxies that translate from commonly used
		protocols in the general 
		Internet to ICN message exchanges in the ICN domain could be
		used for the migration of application and services within
		deployments at the network 
		edge but also in core networks. This is similar to existing
		approaches for IoT scenarios where a proxy translates CoAP
		request/responses to other 
		message formats. For example, <xref target="RFC8075"
		format="default"/> specifies proxy mapping between CoAP and
		HTTP protocols. Also, <xref target="RFC8613"
		format="default"/> 
		is an example of how to pass end-to-end encrypted content
		between HTTP and CoAP by an application-layer security
		mechanism. Further work is required
		to identify if an approach like <xref target="RFC8613"
		format="default"/>, or some other approach, is
		suitable to preserve ICN message security through future
		protocol 
		translation functions of gateways/proxies.
</t>
        <t>Interaction and interoperability between existing IP routing
	protocols (e.g., OSPF, RIP, or IS-IS) and ICN routing
	approaches (e.g.,
	NFD and CCNx routers) 
		are expected, especially in the overlay approach. Another
		important topic is the integration of ICN into networks that
		support virtualized infrastructure 
		in the form of NFV/SDN and most likely utilize SFC as a key
		protocol. Further work is required to validate this idea and
		document best practices.  
</t>
        <t>There are several existing approaches to supporting QoS in IP
	networks, including Diffserv, IntServ, and RSVP. Some initial ideas
	for QoS support in ICN 
		networks are outlined in <xref
		target="I-D.moiseenko-icnrg-flowclass" format="default"/>,
		which proposes an approach based on flow
		classification to enable
		functions, such ICN 
		rate control and cache control. Also, <xref
		target="I-D.anilj-icnrg-icn-qos" format="default"/> proposes
		how to use Diffserv Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
		codes to support QoS for ICN-based data 
		path delivery. Further work is required to identify the best
		approaches for support of QoS in ICN networks. 
</t>
        <t>OAM is a crucial area that has not yet been fully addressed by the
	ICN research community but which is obviously critical for future
	deployments of ICN. 
	  Potential areas that need investigation include whether the YANG
	  data modeling approach and associated NETCONF/RESTCONF protocols
	  need any specific updates 
	  for ICN support. Another open area is how to measure and benchmark
	  performance of ICN networks comparable to the sophisticated
	  techniques that exist for standard 
	  IP networks, virtualized networks, and data centers. It should be

      <name>Conclusion</name>
      <t>This document provides high-level deployment considerations for
      current and future members of the ICN community. Specifically, the 
	  major configurations of possible ICN deployments are identified as
	  (1) Clean-slate ICN replacement of existing Internet infrastructure, 
	  (2) ICN-as-an-Overlay, (3) ICN-as-an-Underlay, (4) ICN-as-a-Slice,
	  and (5) Composite-ICN. Existing ICN trial systems primarily fall 
	  under the ICN-as-an-Overlay, ICN-as-an-Underlay, and Composite-ICN
	  configurations.    
      </t>
      <t>In terms of deployment migration paths, ICN-as-an-Underlay offers a
      clear migration path for CDN, edge, or core networks to go to an 
	  ICN paradigm (e.g., for an IoT deployment) while leaving the
	  critical mass of existing end-user applications untouched.
	  ICN-as-an-Overlay is 
	  the easiest configuration to deploy rapidly, as it leaves the
	  underlying IP infrastructure essentially untouched. However, its 
	  applicability for general deployment must be considered on a
	  case-by-case basis. (That is, can it support all required user
	  applications?). 
	  ICN-as-a-Slice is an attractive deployment option for upcoming 5G
	  systems (i.e., for 5G radio and core networks) that will naturally 
	  support network slicing, but this still has to be validated through
	  more trial experiences. Composite-ICN, by its nature, can combine 
	  some of the best characteristics of the other configurations, but
	  its applicability for general deployment must again be considered 
	  on a case-by-case basis (i.e., can enough IP routers be upgraded to
	  support Composite-ICN functionality to provide sufficient 
	  performance benefits?).
      </t>
      <t>There has been significant trial experience with all the major ICN
      protocol flavors (e.g., CCNx, NDN, and POINT). However, only a limited  
	  number of applications have been tested so far, and the maximum
	  number of users in any given trial has been less than 1k users. It
	  is 
	  recommended that future ICN deployments scale their users gradually
	  and closely monitor network performance as they go above 1k users. 
	  A logical approach would be to increase the number of users in a
	  slowly increasing linear manner and monitor network performance and 
	  stability, especially at every multiple of 1k users.
      </t>
      <t>Finally, this document describes a set of technical features in ICN
      that warrant potential future IETF specification work. This will 
	  aid initial and incremental deployments to proceed in an
	  interoperable manner. The fundamental details of the potential
	  protocol specification 
	  effort, however, are best left for future study by the appropriate
	  IETF WGs and/or BoFs. The ICNRG can aid this process in the 
	  near and mid-term by continuing to examine key system issues like
	  QoS mechanisms, flexible naming schemes, and OAM support for ICN.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>ICN was purposefully designed from the start to have certain
      intrinsic security properties. The most well known of which are
      authentication 
	  of delivered content and (optional) encryption of the content. <xref
	  target="RFC7945" format="default"/> has an extensive discussion of
	  various aspects of ICN security,
	  including many that are relevant to deployments. Specifically,
	  <xref target="RFC7945" format="default"/> points out that ICN access
	  control, privacy, security 
	  of in-network caches, and protection against various network attacks
	  (e.g., DoS) have not yet been fully developed due to the lack of a
	  sufficient 
	  mass of deployments.  <xref target="RFC7945" format="default"/> also
	  points out relevant advances occurring in the ICN research community
	  that hold promise to address 
	  each of the identified security gaps. Lastly, <xref
	  target="RFC7945" format="default"/> points out that as secure
	  communications in the existing Internet (e.g., HTTPS) 
	  become the norm, major gaps in ICN security will inevitably
	  slow down the adoption of ICN.
      </t>
      <t>In addition to the security findings of <xref target="RFC7945"
      format="default"/>, this document has highlighted that all anticipated
      ICN deployment configurations 
	  will involve coexistence with existing Internet infrastructure and
	  applications. Thus, even the basic authentication and encryption
	  properties of ICN 
	  content will need to account for interworking with non-ICN content
	  to preserve end-to-end security. For example, in the edge network
	  underlay deployment 
	  configuration described in <xref target="sec_application_gateways"
	  format="default"/>, the gateway/proxy that translates HTTP or CoAP
	  request/responses into ICN message 
	  exchanges will need to support a security model to preserve
	  end-to-end security. One alternative would be to consider an
	  approach similar to  
	  <xref target="RFC8613" format="default"/>, which is used to pass
	  end-to-end encrypted content between HTTP and CoAP by an
	  application-layer security mechanism. Further  
	  investigation is required to see if this approach is suitable to
	  preserve ICN message security through future protocol translation
	  functions (e.g., ICN to HTTP or CoAP to ICN) of gateways/proxies.
      </t>
      <t>Finally, the DOCTOR project discussed in <xref target="sec_Doctor"
      format="default"/> is an example of an early deployment that is looking
      at specific attacks against 
	  ICN infrastructure, in this case, looking at Interest Flooding
	  Attacks <xref target="Nguyen-2" format="default"/> and Content
	  Poisoning Attacks <xref target="Nguyen-1" format="default"/> 
        <xref target="Mai-2" format="default"/> <xref target="Nguyen-3"
	format="default"/> and evaluating potential countermeasures based
	on MANO-orchestrated actions on the virtualized infrastructure <xref
