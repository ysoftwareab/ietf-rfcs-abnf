        <abstract>
      <t>This document recommends a minimal set of Transport Services offered
      by end systems and gives guidance on choosing among the available
      mechanisms and protocols. It is based on the set of transport features
      in RFC 8303.</t>

        <section anchor="sec-intro" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Currently, the set of Transport Services that most applications use
      is based on TCP and UDP (and protocols that are layered on top of them);
      this limits the ability for the network stack to make use of features of
      other transport protocols. For example, if a protocol supports
      out-of-order message delivery but applications always assume that the
      network provides an ordered byte stream, then the network stack can not
      immediately deliver a message that arrives out of order; doing so would
      break a fundamental assumption of the application. The net result is
      unnecessary head-of-line blocking delay.</t>
      <t>By exposing the Transport Services of multiple transport protocols, a
      transport system can make it possible for applications to use these
      services without being statically bound to a specific transport
      protocol.  The first step towards the design of such a system was taken
      by <xref target="RFC8095" format="default"/>, which surveys a large
      number of transports, and <xref target="RFC8303" format="default"/> as
      well as <xref target="RFC8304" format="default"/>, which identify the
      specific transport features that are exposed to applications by the
      protocols TCP, Multipath TCP (MPTCP), UDP(-Lite), and Stream Control
      Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as well as the Low Extra Delay Background
      Transport (LEDBAT) congestion control mechanism. LEDBAT was included as
      the only congestion control mechanism in this list because the "low
      extra delay background transport" service that it offers is
      significantly different from the typical service provided by other
      congestion control mechanisms.  This memo is based on these documents
      and follows the same terminology (also listed below).  Because the
      considered transport protocols conjointly cover a wide range of
      transport features, there is reason to hope that the resulting set (and
      the reasoning that led to it) will also apply to many aspects of other
      transport protocols that may be in use today or may be designed in the
      future.
      </t>
      <t>By decoupling applications from transport protocols, a transport
      system provides a different abstraction level than the Berkeley sockets
      interface <xref target="POSIX" format="default"/>. As with high-
      vs. low-level programming languages, a higher abstraction level allows
      more freedom for automation below the interface, yet it takes some
      control away from the application programmer. This is the design
      trade-off that a transport system developer is facing, and this document
      provides guidance on the design of this abstraction level. Some
      transport features are currently rarely offered by APIs, yet they must
      be offered or they can never be used.  Other transport features are
      offered by the APIs of the protocols covered here, but not exposing them
      in an API would allow for more freedom to automate protocol usage in a
      transport system.  The minimal set presented here is an effort to find a
      middle ground that can be recommended for transport systems to
      implement, on the basis of the transport features discussed in <xref
      target="RFC8303" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Applications use a wide variety of APIs today. While this document
      was created to ensure the API developed in the Transport Services (TAPS)
      Working Group <xref target="I-D.ietf-taps-interface"
      format="default"/> includes the most important transport features, the
      minimal set presented here must be reflected in *all* network APIs in
      order for the underlying functionality to become usable everywhere. For
      example, it does not help an application that talks to a library that
      offers its own communication interface if the underlying Berkeley
      Sockets API is extended to offer "unordered message delivery", but the
      library only exposes an ordered byte stream. Both the Berkeley Sockets
      API and the library would have to expose the "unordered message
      delivery" transport feature (alternatively, there may be ways for
      certain types of libraries to use this transport feature without
      exposing it, based on knowledge about the applications, but this is not
      the general case). Similarly, transport protocols such as the Stream
      Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) offer multi-streaming, which cannot
      be utilized, e.g., to prioritize messages between streams, unless
      applications communicate the priorities and the group of connections
      upon which these priorities should be applied.  In most situations, in
      the interest of being as flexible and efficient as possible, the best
      choice will be for a library to expose at least all of the transport
      features that are recommended as a "minimal set" here.

      </t>
      <t>
                This "minimal set" can be implemented "one-sided" over TCP.  This means
                that a sender-side transport system can talk to a standard TCP receiver,
                and a receiver-side transport system can talk to a standard TCP sender.
                If certain limitations are put in place, the "minimal set" can also be
                implemented "one-sided" over UDP. While the possibility of such "one-sided"
                implementation may help deployment, it comes at the cost of limiting the
                set to services that can also be provided by TCP (or, with further
                limitations, UDP). Thus, the minimal set of transport features here is
                applicable for many, but not all, applications; some application
                protocols have requirements that are not met by this "minimal set".
      </t>
      <t>
                Note that, throughout this document, protocols are meant to be used
                natively. For example, when transport features of TCP, or "implementation over"
                TCP is discussed, this refers to native usage of TCP rather
		than TCP being encapsulated in some other transport protocol
		such as UDP.

   <t>Moreover, throughout the document, the protocol name "UDP(-Lite)" is used when

      <name>Deriving the Minimal Set</name>
      <t>

                We assume that applications have no specific requirements that
                need knowledge about the network, e.g., regarding the choice of
                network interface or the end-to-end path.  Even with these
                assumptions, there are certain requirements that are strictly
                kept by transport protocols today, and these must also be kept
                by a transport system.  Some of these requirements relate to
                transport features that we call "Functional".
      </t>
      <t>Functional transport features provide functionality that cannot be
      used without the application knowing about them, or else they violate
      assumptions that might cause the application to fail.  For example,
      ordered message delivery is a functional transport feature: it cannot be
      configured without the application knowing about it because the
      application's assumption could be that messages always arrive in
      order. Failure includes any change of the application behavior that is
      not performance oriented, e.g., security.
      </t>
      <t>"Change DSCP" and "Disable Nagle algorithm" are examples of transport
      features that we call "Optimizing"; if a transport system autonomously
      decides to enable or disable them, an application will not fail, but a
      transport system may be able to communicate more efficiently if the
      application is in control of this optimizing transport feature. These
      transport features require application-specific knowledge (e.g., about
      delay/bandwidth requirements or the length of future data blocks that
      are to be transmitted).
      </t>
      <t>
                The transport features of IETF transport protocols that do not
                require application-specific knowledge and could therefore be
                utilized by a transport system on its own without involving
                the application are called "Automatable".
      </t>
      <t>We approach the construction of a minimal set of transport features
      in the following way:
      </t>
      <ol  type="1">
        <li>Categorization (<xref target="super" format="default"/>): The
        superset of transport features from <xref target="RFC8303"
        format="default"/> is presented, and transport features are
        categorized as Functional, Optimizing, or Automatable for later
        reduction.</li>
        <li>Reduction (<xref target="Reduction" format="default"/>): A shorter
        list of transport features is derived from the categorization in the
        first step. This removes all transport features that do not require
        application-specific knowledge or would result in semantically
        incorrect behavior if they were implemented over TCP or UDP.</li>
        <li>Discussion (<xref target="Discussion" format="default"/>): The
        resulting list shows a number of peculiarities that are discussed, to
        provide a basis for constructing the minimal set.</li>
        <li>Construction (<xref target="minset" format="default"/>): Based on
        the reduced set and the discussion of the transport features therein,
        a minimal set is constructed.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>Following <xref target="RFC8303" format="default"/> and retaining its
      terminology, we divide the transport features into two main groups as
      follows:
      </t>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          <t>CONNECTION-related transport features</t>

      <name>The Reduced Set of Transport Features</name>
      <t>By hiding automatable transport features from the application, a transport system can
                gain opportunities to automate the usage of network-related functionality. This can facilitate
                using the transport system
                for the application programmer and it allows for optimizations that may not be possible
                for an application. For instance, system-wide configurations
                regarding the usage of multiple interfaces can better be exploited if the choice of the
                interface is not entirely up to the application. Therefore, since they are not strictly
                necessary to expose in a transport system,
                we do not include automatable transport features in the reduced set of transport
                features. This leaves us with only the transport features that
                are either optimizing or functional.
      </t>
      <t>A transport system should be able to communicate via TCP or UDP if
      alternative transport protocols are found not to work. For many
      transport features, this is possible, often by simply not doing
      anything when a specific request is made.  For some transport features,
      however, it was identified that direct usage of neither TCP nor UDP is
      possible; in these cases, even not doing anything would incur
      semantically incorrect behavior.  Whenever an application would make use
      of one of these transport features, this would eliminate the possibility
      to use TCP or UDP. Thus, we only keep the functional and optimizing
      transport features for which an implementation over either TCP or UDP is
      possible in our reduced set.
      </t>
      <t>The following list contains the transport features from <xref
      target="super" format="default"/>, reduced using these rules. The
      "minimal set" derived in this document is meant to be implementable
      "one-sided" over TCP and, with limitations, UDP. In the list, we
      therefore precede a transport feature with "T:" if an implementation
      over TCP is possible, "U:" if an implementation over UDP is possible,
      and "T,U:" if an implementation over either TCP or UDP is possible.

      <t>The reduced set in the previous section exhibits a number of
      peculiarities, which we will discuss in the following. This section
      focuses on TCP because, with the exception of one particular transport
      feature ("Receive a message"; we will discuss this in <xref
      target="sendmsg" format="default"/>), the list shows that UDP is
      strictly a subset of TCP. We can first try to understand how to build a
      transport system that can run over TCP, and then narrow down the result
      further to allow that the system can always run over either TCP or UDP
      (which effectively means removing everything related to reliability,
      ordering, authentication, and closing/aborting with a notification to the
      peer).
      </t>
      <t>Note that, because the functional transport features of UDP are, with
      the exception of "Receive a message", a subset of TCP, TCP can be used
      as a replacement for UDP whenever an application does not need message
      delimiting (e.g., because the application-layer protocol already does
      it).  This has been recognized by many applications that already do this
      in practice, by trying to communicate with UDP at first and falling
      back to TCP in case of a connection failure.
      </t>
      <section anchor="sendmsg" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Sending Messages, Receiving Bytes</name>
        <t>For implementing a transport system over TCP, there are several
        transport features related to sending, but only a single transport
        feature related to receiving: "Receive data (with no message
        delimiting)" (and, strangely, "information about partial message
        arrival"). Notably, the transport feature "Receive a message" is also
        the only non-automatable transport feature of UDP(-Lite) for which no
        implementation over TCP is possible.</t>
                
                <t>To support these TCP receiver semantics, we define an
                "Application-Framed Byte Stream" (AFra Byte Stream).
                AFra Byte Streams allow senders to operate on messages while
                minimizing changes to the TCP socket API. In particular,
                nothing changes on the receiver side; data can be accepted
                via a normal TCP socket.
        </t>
        <t>In an AFra Byte Stream, the sending application can optionally
        inform the transport about message boundaries and required properties
        per message (configurable order and reliability, or embedding a
        request not to delay the acknowledgement of a message). Whenever the
        sending application specifies per-message properties that relax the
        notion of reliable in-order delivery of bytes, it must assume that the
        receiving application is 1) able to determine message boundaries,
        provided that messages are always kept intact, and 2) able to accept
        these relaxed per-message properties.  Any signaling of such
        information to the peer is up to an application-layer protocol and
        considered out of scope of this document.
        </t>    
                <t>For example, if an application requests to transfer
                fixed-size messages of 100 bytes with partial reliability,
                this needs the receiving application to be prepared to accept
                data in chunks of 100 bytes. Then, if some of these 100-byte
                messages are missing (e.g., if SCTP with Configurable
                Reliability is used), this is the expected application
                behavior. With TCP, no messages would be missing, but this is
                also correct for the application, and the possible
                retransmission delay is acceptable within the best-effort
                service model (see <xref target="RFC7305" sectionFormat="of"
                section="3.5"/>). Still, the receiving application would
                separate the byte stream into 100-byte chunks.
        </t>
        <t>Note that this usage of messages does not require all messages to
        be equal in size.  Many application protocols use some form of
        Type-Length-Value (TLV) encoding, e.g., by defining a header including
        length fields; another alternative is the use of byte stuffing methods
        such as Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing (COBS) <xref target="COBS" format="default"/>. If an application
        needs message numbers, e.g., to restore the correct sequence of
        messages, these must also be encoded by the application itself, as SCTP's
        transport features that are related to the sequence number are not provided by
        the "minimum set" (in the interest of enabling usage of TCP).

        <name>Stream Schedulers without Streams</name>
        <t>We have already stated that multi-streaming does not require application-specific knowledge.
                    Potential benefits or disadvantages of, e.g., using two streams of an SCTP association
                    versus using two separate SCTP associations or TCP connections are related to knowledge
                    about the network and the particular transport protocol in use, not the application.
                    However, the transport features "Choose a scheduler to operate between streams of
                    an association" and "Configure priority or weight for a scheduler" operate on streams.
                    Here, streams identify communication channels between which a scheduler operates, and
                    they can be assigned a priority. Moreover, the transport features in the MAINTENANCE
                    category all operate on associations in case of SCTP, i.e., they apply to all streams in
                    that association.
        </t>
        <t>With only these semantics necessary to represent, the interface to
        a transport system becomes easier if we assume that connections may be
        not only a transport protocol's connection or association, but could
        also be a stream of an existing SCTP association, for example. We only
        need to allow for a way to define a possible grouping of
        connections. Then, all MAINTENANCE transport features can be said to
        operate on connection groups, not connections, and a scheduler
        operates on the connections within a group.
        </t>
        <t>To be compatible with multiple transport protocols and uniformly
        allow access to both transport connections and streams of a
        multi-streaming protocol, the semantics of opening and closing need to
        be the most restrictive subset of all of the underlying options. For
        example, TCP's support of half-closed connections can be seen as a
        feature on top of the more restrictive "ABORT"; this feature cannot be
        supported because not all protocols used by a transport system
        (including streams of an association) support half-closed connections.

      <section anchor="earlydata" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Early Data Transmission</name>
        <t>There are two transport features related to transferring a message
        early: "Hand over a message to reliably transfer (possibly multiple
        times) before connection establishment", which relates to TCP Fast
        Open <xref target="RFC7413" format="default"/>, and "Hand over a
        message to reliably transfer during connection establishment", which
        relates to SCTP's ability to transfer data together with the
        COOKIE-Echo chunk. Also without TCP Fast Open, TCP can transfer data
        during the handshake, together with the SYN packet; however, the
        receiver of this data may not hand it over to the application until
        the handshake has completed. Also, different from TCP Fast Open, this
        data is not delimited as a message by TCP (thus, not visible as a
        "message").  This functionality is commonly available in TCP and
        supported in several implementations, even though the TCP
        specification does not explain how to provide it to applications.
        </t>
        <t>A transport system could differentiate between the cases of
        transmitting data "before" (possibly multiple times) or "during" the
        handshake. Alternatively, it could also assume that data that are
        handed over early will be transmitted as early as possible, and
        "before" the handshake would only be used for messages that are
        explicitly marked as "idempotent" (i.e., it would be acceptable to
        transfer them multiple times).
        </t>
        <t>The amount of data that can successfully be transmitted before or
        during the handshake depends on various factors: the transport
        protocol, the use of header options, the choice of IPv4 and IPv6, and
        the Path MTU. A transport system should therefore allow a sending
        application to query the maximum amount of data it can possibly
        transmit before (or, if exposed, during) connection establishment.

      <section anchor="rundry" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Sender Running Dry</name>
        <t>The transport feature "Notification that the stack has no more user
        data to send" relates to SCTP's "SENDER DRY" notification. Such
        notifications can, in principle, be used to avoid having an
        unnecessarily large send buffer, yet ensure that the transport sender
        always has data available when it has an opportunity to transmit it.
        This has been found to be very beneficial for some applications <xref
        target="WWDC2015" format="default"/>. However, "SENDER DRY" truly
        means that the entire send buffer (including both unsent and
        unacknowledged data) has emptied, i.e., when it notifies the sender,
        it is already too late; the transport protocol already missed an
        opportunity to send data. Some modern TCP implementations now include
        the unspecified "TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT" socket option that was proposed in
        <xref target="WWDC2015" format="default"/>, which limits the amount of
        unsent data that TCP can keep in the socket buffer; this allows
        specifying at which buffer filling level the socket becomes writable,
        rather than waiting for the buffer to run empty.
        </t>
        <t>SCTP allows configuring the sender-side buffer too; the
        automatable Transport Feature "Configure send buffer size" provides
        this functionality, but only for the complete buffer, which includes
        both unsent and unacknowledged data. SCTP does not allow to control
        these two sizes separately. It therefore makes sense for a transport
        system to allow for uniform access to "TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT" as well as
        the "SENDER DRY" notification.

                    All relate to a QoS-like application need such as "low

                    a transport system, they could therefore be offered in a
                    uniform, more abstract way, where a transport system
                    could, e.g., decide by itself how to use combinations of
                    LEDBAT-like congestion control and certain DSCP values,
                    and an application would only specify a general "capacity
                    profile" (a description of how it wants to use the
                    available capacity).  A need for "lowest possible latency
                    at the expense of overhead" could then translate into
                    automatically disabling the Nagle algorithm.
        </t>
        <t>In some cases, the Nagle algorithm is best controlled directly by
        the application because it is not only related to a general profile
        but also to knowledge about the size of future messages.  For
        fine-grain control over Nagle-like functionality, the "Request not to

      <name>The Minimal Set of Transport Features</name>
      <t> Based on the categorization, reduction, and discussion in <xref
      target="deriving" format="default"/>, this section describes a minimal
      set of transport features that end systems should offer.  Any
      configuration based on the described minimum set of transport feature can
      always be realized over TCP but also gives the transport system
      flexibility to choose another transport if implemented.  In the text of
      this section, "not UDP" is used to indicate elements of the system that
      cannot be implemented over UDP. Conversely, all elements of the system
      that are not marked with "not UDP" can also be implemented over UDP.
      </t>
      <t> The arguments laid out in <xref target="Discussion"
      format="default"/> ("discussion") were used to make the final
      representation of the minimal set as short, simple, and general as
      possible. There may be situations where these arguments do not apply,
      e.g., implementers may have specific reasons to expose multi-streaming
      as a visible functionality to applications, or the restrictive
      open/close semantics may be problematic under some circumstances.  In
      such cases, the representation in <xref target="Reduction"
      format="default"/> ("reduction") should be considered.
      </t>
      <t> As in <xref target="deriving" format="default"/>, <xref
      target="Reduction" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC8303"
      format="default"/>, we categorize the minimal set of transport features
      as 1) CONNECTION related (ESTABLISHMENT, AVAILABILITY, MAINTENANCE,
      TERMINATION) and 2) DATA Transfer related (Sending Data, Receiving Data,
      Errors). Here, the focus is on connections that the transport system
      offers as an abstraction to the application, as opposed to connections
      of transport protocols that the transport system uses.

      </t>

      <section anchor="minset-init" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>ESTABLISHMENT, AVAILABILITY, and TERMINATION</name>
        <t>A connection must first be "created" to allow for some initial
        configuration to be carried out before the transport system can
        actively or passively establish communication with a remote end
        system. As a configuration of the newly created connection, an
        application can choose to disallow usage of MPTCP. Furthermore, all
        configuration parameters in <xref target="minset-groupconfig"
        format="default"/> can be used initially, although some of them may
        only take effect when a connection has been established with a chosen
        transport protocol. Configuring a connection early helps a transport
        system make the right decisions. For example, grouping information can
        influence whether or not the transport system implements a connection as a stream
        of a multi-streaming protocol's existing association.
        </t>
        <t>
                    For ungrouped connections, early configuration is
                    necessary because it allows the transport system to know
                    which protocols it should try to use.  In particular, a
                    transport system that only makes a one-time choice for a
                    particular protocol must know early about strict
                    requirements that must be kept, or it can end up in a
                    deadlock situation (e.g., having chosen UDP and later be
                    asked to support reliable transfer). As an example
                    description of how to correctly handle these cases, we
                    provide the following decision tree (this is derived from

        priority or weight for a scheduler", which is only offered by SCTP,
        the above decision tree will always choose UDP-Lite, making it
        impossible to use SCTP's schedulers with priorities between grouped
        connections. Also, several other factors may influence the decisions
        for or against a protocol, e.g.,  penetration rates, the ability to
        work through NATs, etc.  We caution implementers to be aware of the
        full set of trade-offs, for which we recommend consulting the list in
        <xref target="conn-reduced" format="default"/> when deciding how to
        initialize a connection.
        </t>
        <t>To summarize, the following parameters serve as input for the
        transport system to help it choose and configure a suitable
        protocol:</t>
     
<dl>
<dt>Reliability:
</dt>
<dd>a boolean that should be set to true when any of the following will be
useful to the application: reliably transfer data; notify the peer of
closing/aborting; or preserve data ordering.
</dd>
<dt>Checksum coverage:
</dt>
<dd>a boolean to specify whether it will be useful to the application to
specify checksum coverage when sending or receiving.
</dd>

<dt>Configure message priority:
</dt>
<dd>a boolean that should be set to true when any of the following
per-message configuration or prioritization mechanisms will be useful to the
application: choosing a scheduler to operate between grouped connections, with
the possibility to configure a priority or weight per connection; configurable
message reliability; unordered message delivery; or requesting not to delay the
acknowledgement (SACK) of a message.
</dd>
<dt>Early message timeout notifications: 
</dt>
<dd>a boolean that should be set to true when any of the following will be
useful to the application: hand over a message to reliably transfer (possibly
multiple times) before connection establishment; suggest timeout to the peer;
notification of excessive retransmissions (early warning below abortion
threshold); or notification of ICMP error message arrival.
</dd>
</dl>

    <t>Once a connection is created, it can be queried for the maximum
        amount of data that an application can possibly expect to have
        reliably transmitted before or during transport connection
        establishment (with zero being a possible answer) (see <xref
        target="minset-maintenance-grouped" format="default"/>).  An
        application can also give the connection a message for reliable
        transmission before or during connection establishment (not UDP); the
        transport system will then try to transmit it as early as possible. An
        application can facilitate sending a message particularly early by
        marking it as "idempotent" (see <xref
        target="minset-datatrans-sending" format="default"/>); in this case,
        the receiving application must be prepared to potentially receive
        multiple copies of the message (because idempotent messages are
        reliably transferred, asking for idempotence is not necessary for
        systems that support UDP).
        </t>
        <t>
                    After creation, a transport system can actively establish
                    communication with a peer, or it can passively listen for
                    incoming connection requests. Note that active
                    establishment may or may not trigger a notification on the
                    listening side. It is possible that the first notification
                    on the listening side is the arrival of the first data
                    that the active side sends (a receiver-side transport
                    system could handle this by continuing to block a "Listen"
                    call, immediately followed, for example, by issuing
                    "Receive"; callback-based implementations could simply
                    skip the equivalent of "Listen"). This also means that the
                    active opening side is assumed to be the first side
                    sending data.
        </t>
        <t>A transport system can actively close a connection, i.e., terminate
        it after reliably delivering all remaining data to the peer (if
        reliable data delivery was requested earlier (not UDP)), in which case
        the peer is notified that the connection is closed. Alternatively, a
        connection can be aborted without delivering outstanding data to the
        peer. In case reliable or partially reliable data delivery was
        requested earlier (not UDP), the peer is notified that the connection
        is aborted.  A timeout can be configured to abort a connection when
        data could not be delivered for too long (not UDP); however,
        timeout-based abortion does not notify the peer application that the
        connection has been aborted. Because half-closed connections are not
        supported, when a host implementing a transport system receives a
        notification that the peer is closing or aborting the connection (not
        UDP), its peer may not be able to read outstanding data. This means
        that unacknowledged data residing in a transport system's send buffer
        may have to be dropped from that buffer upon arrival of a "close" or
        "abort" notification from the peer.

      <section anchor="minset-groupconfig" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>MAINTENANCE</name>
        <t>A transport system must offer means to group connections, but it
        cannot guarantee truly grouping them using the transport protocols
        that it uses (e.g., it cannot be guaranteed that connections become
        multiplexed as streams on a single SCTP association when SCTP may not
        be available).  The transport system must therefore ensure that group-
        versus non-group-configurations are handled correctly in some way
        (e.g., by applying the configuration to all grouped connections even
        when they are not multiplexed, or informing the application about
        grouping success or failure).
        </t>
        <t>As a general rule, any configuration described below should be carried
                    out as early as possible to aid the transport system's decision making.
        </t>

        <section anchor="minset-maintenance-grouped" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Connection Groups</name>
          <t>The following transport features and notifications (some directly
          from <xref target="Reduction" format="default"/>; some new or
          changed, based on the discussion in <xref target="Discussion"
          format="default"/>) automatically apply to all grouped connections:
          </t>
          <t>Configure a timeout (not UDP)<br/>This can be done with the following parameters:</t>
          <ul>
            <li>A timeout value for aborting connections, in seconds.</li>
            <li>A timeout value to be suggested to the peer (if possible), in seconds.</li>
            <li>The number of retransmissions after which the application
            should be notified of "Excessive Retransmissions".</li>
          </ul>
          <t>Configure urgency<br/>This can be done with the following parameters:</t>
          <ul>
            <li>A number to identify the type of scheduler that should be used
            to operate between connections in the group (no guarantees
            given). Schedulers are defined in <xref target="RFC8260"
            format="default"/>.</li>

<li>A "capacity profile" number to identify how an application
            wants to use its available capacity.  Choices can be "lowest
            possible latency at the expense of overhead" (which would disable
            any Nagle-like algorithm), "scavenger", or values that help
            determine the DSCP value for a connection.</li>
            <li>A buffer limit (in bytes); when the sender has less than the
            provided limit of bytes in the buffer, the application may be
            notified. Notifications are not guaranteed, and it is optional for
            a transport system to support buffer limit values greater than 0.
            Note that this limit and its notification should operate across
            the buffers of the whole transport system, i.e.,  also any
            potential buffers that the transport system itself may use on top
            of the transport's send buffer.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>Following <xref target="packetsize" format="default"/>, these properties can be queried:</t>
          <ul>
            <li>The maximum message size that may be sent without
            fragmentation via the configured interface. This is optional for a
            transport system to offer and may return an error ("not
            available"). It can aid applications implementing Path MTU
            Discovery.</li>
            <li>The maximum transport message size that can be sent, in
            bytes. Irrespective of fragmentation, there is a size limit for
            the messages that can be handed over to SCTP or UDP(-Lite);
            because the service provided by a transport system is independent
            of the transport protocol, it must allow an application to query
            this value: the maximum size of a message in an
            Application-Framed Byte Stream (see <xref target="sendmsg"
            format="default"/>). This may also return an error when data is
            not delimited ("not available").</li>
            <li>The maximum transport message size that can be received from
            the configured interface, in bytes (or "not available").</li>
            <li>The maximum amount of data that can possibly be sent before or
            during connection establishment, in bytes.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>In addition to the already mentioned closing/aborting
          notifications and possible send errors, the following notifications
          can occur:</t>

<dl>
  <dt>Excessive Retransmissions:
  </dt>
    <dd>The configured (or a default) number of retransmissions has been
    reached, yielding this early warning below an abortion threshold.
    </dd>
  <dt>ICMP Arrival (parameter: ICMP message):
  </dt>
    <dd>An ICMP packet carrying the conveyed ICMP message has arrived.
    </dd>
  <dt>ECN Arrival (parameter: ECN value): 
  </dt>
    <dd>A packet carrying the conveyed Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) value has arrived. This can be
    useful for applications implementing congestion control.
    </dd>
  <dt>Timeout (parameter: s seconds):
  </dt>
    <dd>Data could not be delivered for s seconds.
    </dd>
  <dt>Drain:
  </dt>
    <dd>The send buffer has either drained below the configured buffer limit
    or it has become completely empty. This is a generic notification that
    tries to enable uniform access to "TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT" as well as the
    "SENDER DRY" notification (as discussed in <xref target="rundry"/>; SCTP's "SENDER
    DRY" is a special case where the threshold (for unsent data) is 0 and
    there is also no more unacknowledged data in the send buffer).

          <name>Sending Data</name>
          <t>When sending a message, no guarantees are given about the
          preservation of message boundaries to the peer; if message
          boundaries are needed, the receiving application at the peer must
          know about them beforehand (or the transport system cannot use
          TCP). Note that an application should already be able to hand over
          data before the transport system establishes a connection with a
          chosen transport protocol. Regarding the message that is being
          handed over, the following parameters can be used:</t>
         
<dl>
  <dt>Reliability:
  </dt>
    <dd>This parameter is used to convey a choice of: fully reliable with
    congestion control (not UDP), unreliable without congestion control,
    unreliable with congestion control (not UDP), and partially reliable with
    congestion control (see <xref target="RFC3758" format="default"/> and
    <xref target="RFC7496" format="default"/> for details on how to specify
    partial reliability) (not UDP). The latter two choices are optional for a
    transport system to offer and may result in full reliability. Note that
    applications sending unreliable data without congestion control should
    themselves perform congestion control in accordance with <xref
    target="RFC8085" format="default"/>.
    </dd>


  <dt>Ordered (not UDP): 
  </dt>
    <dd>This boolean lets an application choose between ordered
    message delivery (true) and possibly unordered, potentially faster message
    delivery (false).
    </dd>
  <dt>Bundle:
  </dt>
    <dd>This boolean expresses a preference for allowing to bundle messages
    (true) or not (false). No guarantees are given.
    </dd>
  <dt>DelAck:
  </dt>

    <dd>This boolean, if false, lets an application request that the peer not
    delay the acknowledgement for this message.
    </dd>
  <dt>Fragment: 
  </dt>
    <dd>This boolean expresses a preference for allowing to fragment
    messages (true) or not (false), at the IP level. No guarantees are given.
    </dd>
  <dt>Idempotent (not UDP):
  </dt>
    <dd>This boolean expresses whether a message is idempotent (true) or not
    (false). Idempotent messages may arrive multiple times at the receiver
    (but they will arrive at least once). When data is idempotent, it can be
    used by the receiver immediately on a connection establishment
    attempt. Thus, if data is handed over before the transport system
    establishes a connection with a chosen transport protocol, stating that a
    message is idempotent facilitates transmitting it to the peer application
    particularly early.
    </dd>
</dl>

          <t>An application can be notified of a failure to send a specific
          message. There is no guarantee of such notifications, i.e., send
          failures can also silently occur.</t>

        <section anchor="minset-datatrans-receiving" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Receiving Data</name>
          <t>A receiving application obtains an "Application-Framed
          Byte Stream" (AFra Byte Stream); this concept is further described in
          <xref target="sendmsg" format="default"/>. In line with TCP's
          receiver semantics, an AFra Byte Stream is just a stream of bytes to
          the receiver. If message boundaries were specified by the sender, a
          receiver-side transport system implementing only the minimum set of
          Transport Services defined here will still not inform the receiving
          application about them (this limitation is only needed for transport
          systems that are implemented to directly use TCP).</t>
          <t>Different from TCP's semantics, if the sending application has
          allowed that messages are not fully reliably transferred, or
          delivered out of order, then such reordering or unreliability may
          be reflected per message in the arriving data. Messages will always
          stay intact, i.e., if an incomplete message is contained at the end
          of the arriving data block, this message is guaranteed to continue
          in the next arriving data block.</t>

      <name>The Superset of Transport Features</name>
      <t>
                    In this description, transport features are presented
                    following the nomenclature
                    "CATEGORY.[SUBCATEGORY].FEATURENAME.PROTOCOL", equivalent
                    to "pass 2" in <xref target="RFC8303" format="default"/>.
                    We also sketch how functional or optimizing transport
                    features can be implemented by a transport system.  The
                    "minimal set" derived in this document is meant to be
                    implementable "one-sided" over TCP and, with limitations,
                    UDP. Hence, for all transport features that are
                    categorized as "functional" or "optimizing", and for which
                    no matching TCP and/or UDP primitive exists in "pass 2" of
                    <xref target="RFC8303" format="default"/>, a brief
                    discussion on how to implement them over TCP and/or UDP is
                    included.
      </t>
      <t>We designate some transport features as "automatable" on the basis of
      a broader decision that affects multiple transport features:
      </t>
      <ul>
        <li>Most transport features that are related to multi-streaming were
        designated as "automatable".  This was done because the decision on
        whether or not to use multi-streaming does not depend on
        application-specific knowledge. This means that a connection that is
        exhibited to an application could be implemented by using a single
        stream of an SCTP association instead of mapping it to a complete SCTP
        association or TCP connection. This could be achieved by using more
        than one stream when an SCTP association is first established
        (CONNECT.SCTP parameter "outbound stream count"), maintaining an
        internal stream number, and using this stream number when sending data
        (SEND.SCTP parameter "stream number"). Closing or aborting a
        connection could then simply free the stream number for future use.
        This is discussed further in <xref target="nostream"
        format="default"/>.
                        </li>
        <li>With the exception of "Disable MPTCP", all transport features that
        are related to using multiple paths or the choice of the network
        interface were designated as "automatable". For example, "Listen"
        could always listen on all available interfaces and "Connect" could
        use the default interface for the destination IP address.
                        </li>
      </ul>

      <t>
                    Finally, in three cases, transport features are aggregated
                    and/or slightly changed from <xref target="RFC8303"
                    format="default"/> in the description below.  These
                    transport features are marked as "CHANGED FROM
                    RFC 8303". These do not add any new functionality but just
                    represent a simple refactoring step that helps to
                    streamline the derivation process (e.g., by removing a
                    choice of a parameter for the sake of applications that
                    may not care about this choice).  The corresponding
                    transport features are automatable, and they are listed
                    immediately below the "CHANGED FROM RFC 8303" transport
                    feature.

                                hosts relates to knowledge about
                                the network, not the application.</t>

                                not to use this feature depends on knowledge
                                about the network as well as

                                Implementation: via parameters in CONNECT.TCP
                                and CONNECT.SCTP.  With TCP, this allows
                                configuring Master Key Tuples (MKTs) to
                                authenticate complete segments (including the
                                TCP IPv4 pseudoheader, TCP header, and TCP
                                data).  With SCTP, this allows specifying
                                which chunk types must always be
                                authenticated.  Authenticating only certain
                                chunk types creates a reduced level of
                                security that is not supported by TCP; to be
                                compatible, this should therefore only allow
                                to authenticate all chunk types.  Key material
                                must be provided in a way that is compatible
                                with both <xref target="RFC4895"

                                Implementation over TCP: with TCP, this allows
                                configuring Master Key Tuples (MKTs) to
                                authenticate complete segments (including the
                                TCP IPv4 pseudoheader, TCP header, and TCP
                                data).  With SCTP, this allows specifying
                                which chunk types must always be
                                authenticated.  Authenticating only certain
                                chunk types creates a reduced level of
                                security that is not supported by TCP; to be
                                compatible, this should therefore only allow
                                to authenticate all chunk types.  Key material
                                must be provided in a way that is compatible

                                Based on the assumption of the best-effort
                                service model, ordered delivery may just be
                                slower and does not violate application
                                expectations. Moreover, it is not possible to
                                associate the requested delivery order to a
