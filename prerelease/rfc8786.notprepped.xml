    <abstract>

      <t>Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
      (PCEP) to support stateful Path Computation Elements (PCEs) are defined
      in RFC 8231.  One of the extensions is the Stateful PCE Request
      Parameters (SRP) object.  That object includes a Flags field that is a
      set of 32 bit flags, and RFC 8281 defines an IANA registry for tracking
      assigned flags.  However, RFC 8231 does not explain how an
      implementation should set unassigned flags in transmitted messages, nor
      how an implementation should process unassigned, unknown, or unsupported
      flags in received messages.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5440" format="default"/> describes the Path
      Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP defines the
      communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path
      Computation Element (PCE), or between PCEs, enabling computation of
      Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic Engineering Label
      Switched Path (TE LSP) characteristics.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC8231" format="default"/> specifies a set of
      extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of LSPs within and across
      PCEP sessions in compliance with <xref target="RFC4657"
      format="default"/>.  It includes mechanisms to effect Label Switched
      Path (LSP) State Synchronization between PCCs and PCEs, delegation of
      control over LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of
      path computations within and across PCEP sessions.</t>
      <t>One of the extensions defined in <xref target="RFC8231"
      format="default"/> is the Stateful PCE Request Parameters (SRP) object.
      That object includes a Flags field that is a set of 32 bit flags, and
      RFC 8281 defines an IANA registry for tracking assigned
      flags.  However, RFC 8231 does not explain how an
      implementation should set unassigned flags in transmitted messages, nor
      how an implementation should process unassigned or unknown flags in
      received messages.</t>
      <t>Furthermore, <xref target="RFC8231"/> gives no
      guidance to the authors of future specifications about how to describe
      the interaction between flags that have already been defined and flags
      being defined in the new specifications.</t>
      <t>This document updates RFC 8231 by defining the correct behaviors.</t>

        changes to existing PCEP objects and defines new PCEP objects and TLVs

        <t>The text in <xref target="RFC8231" sectionFormat="of" section="7"/>
        is updated to read as follows:

        <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
          <li>The PCEP objects defined in this document are compliant with the
          PCEP object format defined in <xref target="RFC5440"
          format="default"/>.  The P and I flags of the PCEP objects defined
          in the current document <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to 0 on
          transmission and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be ignored on receipt since
          they are exclusively related to path computation requests.</li>
          <li>The sections that follow define PCEP objects and TLVs that
          contain Flags fields, and some flag values are defined.  Future
          specifications may define further flags, and each new specification
          that defines additional flags is expected to describe the
          interaction between these new flags and any existing flags.  In
          particular, new specifications are expected to explain how to handle
          the cases when both new and pre-existing flags are set.</li>

      <name>Compatibility Considerations</name>
      <t>While one of the main objectives of the changes made by this document
      is to enable backward compatibility, there remains an issue of
      compatibility between existing implementations of RFC 8231 and
      implementations that are consistent with this document.</t>
      <t>It should be noted that common behavior for Flags fields is as
      described by the updated text presented in <xref target="update"
      format="default"/>.  Thus, many implementations, lacking guidance from
      RFC 8231, will still have implemented a consistent and future-proof
      approach.  However, for completeness, it is worth noting how behaviors
      might interact between implementations.</t>
      <t>SRP objects generated by an implementation of this document will set
      all unknown flag bits to zero and will therefore cause no issues to an
      older implementation even if it inspects those bits.  Similarly, an
      implementation of this document will not inspect any unknown flag bits
      and will therefore be unaffected by older implementations no matter how
      they set the flags.</t>

      <t>There will remain an issue with compatibility between implementations
      and how they set the flags. An implementation of RFC 8231 might set any
      of the unassigned flags, but an implementation of a future or current
      specification (such as <xref target="RFC8281" format="default"/> or
      <xref target="RFC8741" format="default"/>) assigns specific meanings to
      a flag if set. That problem cannot be fixed in old implementations by
      any amount of documentation and can only be handled for future
      specifications by obsoleting the Flags field and using a new technique.
      Fortunately, however, most implementations will have been constructed to
      set unused flags to zero, which is consistent with the behavior
      described in this document, and so the risk of bad interactions is
      sufficiently small that there is no need to obsolete the existing Flags
      field.</t>

    <section anchor="Management" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Management Considerations</name>
      <t>Implementations receiving set SRP flags that they do not recognize <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> log this.  That could
          be helpful for diagnosing backward compatibility issues with future features that utilize those
          flags.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="Security" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t><xref target="RFC8231" format="default"/> sets out security considerations for PCEP when used for communication
         with a stateful PCE.  This document does not change those considerations.</t>
      <t>However, by defining the expected behavior of implementations, this
      document may improve the stability of networks and thus reduce the
      attack surface.  That is, by reminding implementations to ignore unset
      bits, it is less possible to attack them by randomly tweaking bits.
      Furthermore, by reminding implementations to leave undefined bits unset,
      the network is future-proofed against new definitions of previously
      undefined bits.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>IANA Considerations</name>
      <t>IANA maintains a registry called the "Path Computation Element
      Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry with a subregistry called "SRP Object
      Flag Field". IANA has updated the reference for that
      subregistry to list this document in addition to
      <xref target="RFC8281"/>.</t>
