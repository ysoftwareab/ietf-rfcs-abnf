                The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to local Routing
                Information Bases (RIBs). This document updates BMP (RFC 7854) by
                adding access to the Local Routing Information Base (Loc-RIB), as
                defined in RFC 4271. The Loc-RIB contains the routes that have been
		selected by the local BGP speaker's Decision Process.

                This document defines a mechanism to monitor the BGP Loc-RIB state
                of remote BGP instances without the need to establish BGP peering
                sessions.

                BMP <xref target="RFC7854" format="default"/> does not define a method to send
                the BGP instance Loc-RIB. 

                It does define locally originated routes in <xref target="RFC7854" sectionFormat="of" section="8.2"/>,
                but these routes are defined as the routes that originated into BGP (e.g., 
                <xref target="RFC4271" sectionFormat="of" section="9.4"/>). Loc-RIB
                includes all selected received routes from BGP peers in addition to locally
                originated routes.

      <t>
                The following are some use cases for Loc-RIB access:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
            <t>
                        The Adj-RIB-In for a given peer post-policy may contain hundreds of
                        thousands of routes, with only a handful of routes selected and installed
                        in the Loc-RIB after best-path selection.
                        Some monitoring applications, such as those that need only to
                        correlate flow records to Loc-RIB entries, only need to collect
                        and monitor the routes that are actually selected and used.

            </t>
            <t>

                        Requiring the applications to collect all Adj-RIB-In post-policy
                        data forces the applications to receive a potentially
                        large unwanted data set and to perform the BGP decision process
                        selection, which includes having access to the interior gateway
                        protocol (IGP) next-hop metrics. While it is possible to obtain
                        the IGP topology information using BGP - Link State (BGP-LS),
                        it requires the application to implement Shortest Path First (SPF)
                        and possibly Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) based on
                        additional policies. This is overly complex for such a
                        simple application that only needs to have access to the Loc-RIB.
            </t>                        

        </li>
        <li>
                        It is common to see frequent changes over many BGP peers, but
                        those changes do not always result in the router's Loc-RIB
                        changing. The change in the Loc-RIB can have a direct impact
                        on the forwarding state. It can greatly reduce the time to
                        troubleshoot and resolve issues if operators have the history of
                        Loc-RIB changes. For example, a performance issue might have
                        been seen for only a duration of 5 minutes. Post-facto
                        troubleshooting this issue without Loc-RIB history hides any
                        decision-based routing changes that might have happened during
                        those 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
                        Operators may wish to validate the impact of policies applied
                        to the Adj-RIB-In by analyzing the final decision made by the
                        router when installing into the Loc-RIB. For example, in order
                        to validate if multipath prefixes are installed as expected
                        for all advertising peers, the Adj-RIB-In post-policy and Loc-RIB
                        need to be compared. This is only possible if the Loc-RIB
                        is available. Monitoring the Adj-RIB-In for this router from
                        another router to derive the Loc-RIB is likely to not show the same
                        installed prefixes. For example, the received Adj-RIB-In will
                        be different if ADD-PATH <xref target="RFC7911" format="default"/>
                        is not enabled or if the maximum supported number of equal paths is different
                        between Loc-RIB and advertised routes.
      </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
                This document adds Loc-RIB to the BGP Monitoring Protocol and
                replaces <xref target="RFC7854" sectionFormat="of" section="8.2"/> ("Locally Originated Routes").
      </t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Alternative Method to Monitor Loc-RIB</name>
        <t>
                    Loc-RIB is used to build Adj-RIB-Out when advertising routes to a
                    peer. It is therefore possible to derive the Loc-RIB of a router by
                    monitoring the Adj-RIB-In pre-policy from another router.  
                    This becomes overly complex and error prone when considering the number
                    of peers being monitored per router.

                    The setup needed to monitor the Loc-RIB of a router requires another
                    router with a peering session to the target router that is to be
                    monitored. As shown in <xref target="FigCurLocRibMon" format="default"/>, the
                    target router Loc-RIB is advertised via the Adj-RIB-Out
                    to the BMP router over a standard BGP peering session. The BMP
                    router then forwards the Adj-RIB-In pre-policy to the BMP receiver.
        </t>
        <t>
                    A BMP lacking access to Loc-RIB introduces the need for additional
		    resources:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
                    Requires at least two routers when only one router was to be
                    monitored.
          </li>
          <li>
                    Requires additional BGP peering to collect the received updates
                    when peering may not have even been required in the first
                    place. For example, virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) tables 
                    with no peers, redistributed BGP-LS with no peers, and
                    segment routing egress peer engineering where no
                    peers have link-state address family enabled are all
                    situations with no preexisting BGP peers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
                    Many complexities are introduced when using a received Adj-RIB-In
                    to infer a router Loc-RIB:

        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
                    Adj-RIB-Out received as Adj-RIB-In from another router may have
                    a policy applied that generates aggregates, suppresses
                    more specific prefixes, manipulates attributes, or filters routes. Not
                    only does this invalidate the Loc-RIB view, it adds complexity
                    when multiple BMP routers may have peering sessions to the same
                    router. The BMP receiver user is left with the error-prone task of
                    identifying which peering session is the best representative of
                    the Loc-RIB.
          </li>
          <li>
                    BGP peering is designed to work between administrative domains
                    and therefore does not need to include internal system-level
                    information of each peering router (e.g., the system name or
                    version information). In order to derive the Loc-RIB of a router,
                    the router name or other system information is needed. The BMP
                    receiver and user are forced to do some type of correlation using
                    whatever information is available in the peering session (e.g., peering
                    addresses, autonomous system numbers, and BGP identifiers).
                    This leads to error-prone correlations.
          </li>
          <li>
                    Correlating BGP identifiers (BGP-ID) and session addresses to a 
                    router requires additional data, such as router inventory. This
                    additional data provides the BMP receiver the ability to map and
                    correlate the BGP-IDs and/or session addresses but requires the
                    BMP receiver to somehow obtain this data outside of the BMP. How this
                    data is obtained and the accuracy of the data directly affect the
                    integrity of the correlation.

            messages to convey capabilities as well as Route Monitor messages to
            convey Loc-RIB.  In this sense, the peer that conveys the Loc-RIB is

            header distinguisher and BGP ID.  The BMP receiver uses the VRF/Table
            Name from the Peer Up information to associate a name with the Loc-RIB.
          </t>
          <t>
            In some implementations, it might be required to have more than one

            the same Loc-RIB.  In this case, the peer distinguisher and BGP ID

            There may be use cases where BMP receivers should only receive

            filtered. If multiple filters are associated with the same Loc-RIB,
