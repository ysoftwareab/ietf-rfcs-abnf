    <abstract>
      <t>RTP allows multiple RTP streams to be sent in a single session but
      requires each Synchronization Source (SSRC) to send RTP Control Protocol
      (RTCP)
      reception quality reports for every other SSRC visible in the session. This causes
      the number of RTCP reception reports to grow with the number of SSRCs,
      rather than the number of endpoints. In many cases, most of these RTCP
      reception reports are unnecessary, since all SSRCs of an endpoint are
      normally co-located and see the same reception quality. This memo
      defines a Reporting Group extension to RTCP to reduce the reporting
      overhead in such scenarios.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref target="RFC3550" format="default"/> is a
      protocol for group communication, supporting multiparty multimedia
      sessions. A single RTP session can support multiple participants sending
      data at once and can also support participants sending multiple simultaneous
      RTP streams. Examples of the latter might include a participant with
      multiple cameras who chooses to send multiple views of a scene, or a
      participant that sends audio and video flows multiplexed in a single RTP
      session. Rules for handling RTP sessions containing multiple RTP streams
      are described in <xref target="RFC3550" format="default"/>, with some clarifications in
      <xref target="RFC8108" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>An RTP endpoint will have one or more Synchronization Sources
      (SSRCs). It will have at least one RTP stream, and thus at least one SSRC, for each
      media source it sends, and it might use multiple SSRCs per media source
      when using <xref target="RFC6190" format="default">media scalability features</xref>,
      forward error correction, <xref target="RFC4588" format="default">RTP
      retransmission</xref>, or similar mechanisms. An endpoint that is not
      sending any RTP streams will have at least one SSRC to use for reporting
      and any feedback messages. Each SSRC has to send RTP Control Protocol
      (RTCP) Sender Reports (SRs) corresponding to the RTP packets it sends
      and Receiver Reports (RRs) for traffic it receives. (SRs and RRs are
      described in <xref target="RFC3550"/>.) That is, every SSRC will send RTCP packets to
      report on every other SSRC. This rule is simple, but it can be quite
      inefficient for endpoints that send large numbers of RTP streams in a
      single RTP session. Consider a session comprising ten participants, each
      sending three media sources, each media source associated with its own RTP stream. There will
      be 30 SSRCs in such an RTP session, and each of those 30 SSRCs will send
      an RTCP SR/RR packet (containing several report
      blocks) per reporting interval as each SSRC reports on all the others.
      However, the three SSRCs comprising each participant are commonly
      co-located such that they see identical reception quality. If there was
      a way to indicate that several SSRCs are co-located and see the same
      reception quality, then two-thirds of those RTCP reports could be
      suppressed. This would allow the remaining RTCP reports to be sent more
      often, while keeping within the same RTCP bandwidth fraction.</t>
      <t>This memo defines such an RTCP extension: RTCP Reporting Groups. This
      extension is used to indicate the SSRCs that originate from the same
      endpoint and therefore have identical reception quality, hence allowing
      the endpoints to suppress unnecessary RTCP reception quality
      reports.</t>

      <name>RTCP Reporting Groups</name>
      <t>An RTCP Reporting Group is a set of SSRCs that are co&nbhy;located at a single endpoint (which could be an end host or
      a middlebox) in an RTP session. Since they are co-located, every SSRC in
      the RTCP Reporting Group will have an identical view of the network
      conditions and will see the same lost packets, jitter, etc. This allows a
      single representative to send RTCP reception quality reports on behalf
      of the rest of the Reporting Group, reducing the number of RTCP packets
      that need to be sent without loss of information.</t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Semantics and Behavior of RTCP Reporting Groups</name>
        <t>A group of co-located SSRCs that see identical network conditions
        can form an RTCP Reporting Group. If Reporting Groups are in use, an
        RTP endpoint with multiple SSRCs <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> put those SSRCs into a Reporting
        Group if their view of the network is identical, i.e., if they report
        on traffic received at the same interface of an RTP endpoint. SSRCs
        with different views of the network <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be put into the same
        Reporting Group.</t>
        <t>An endpoint that has combined its SSRCs into an RTCP Reporting
        Group will choose one (or a subset) of those SSRCs to act as
        "reporting source(s)" for that RTCP Reporting Group. A reporting
        source will send RTCP SR/RR reception quality reports on behalf of the
        other members of the RTCP Reporting Group. A reporting source <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
        suppress the RTCP SR/RR reports that relate to other members of the
        Reporting Group and only report on remote SSRCs. The other members
        (non-reporting sources) of the RTCP Reporting Group will suppress
        their RTCP reception quality reports and will instead send an
        RTCP Reporting Group Reporting Sources (RGRS)
        packet (see <xref target="sec-rgrs" format="default"/>) to indicate that they are part
        of an RTCP Reporting Group and give the SSRCs of the reporting
        sources.</t>
        <t>If there are large numbers of remote SSRCs in the RTP session, then
        the reception quality reports generated by the reporting source might
        grow too large to fit into a single compound RTCP packet, forcing the
        reporting source to use a round-robin policy to determine what remote
        SSRCs it includes in each compound RTCP packet, and so reducing the
        frequency of reports on each SSRC. To avoid this, in sessions with
        large numbers of remote SSRCs, an RTCP Reporting Group <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use more
        than one reporting source. If several SSRCs are acting as reporting
        sources for an RTCP Reporting Group, then each reporting source <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
        have non-overlapping sets of remote SSRCs it reports on.</t>
        <t>An endpoint <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> create an RTCP Reporting Group that comprises
        only a single local SSRC (i.e., an RTCP Reporting Group where the
        reporting source is the only member of the group), unless it is
        anticipated that the group might have additional SSRCs added to it in
        the future.</t>
        <t>If a reporting source leaves the RTP session (i.e., if it sends an
        RTCP BYE packet or it leaves the session without sending a BYE
        according to the
        rules of <xref target="RFC3550" sectionFormat="comma" section="6.3.7"/>), the remaining
        members of the RTCP Reporting Group <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> (a)&nbsp;have another
        reporting source -- if one exists -- report on the remote SSRCs that
        the leaving SSRC had reported on, (b)&nbsp;choose a new reporting source, or (c)&nbsp;disband the RTCP Reporting Group and begin sending reception quality
        reports per <xref target="RFC3550" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8108" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>The RTCP timing rules assign different bandwidth fractions to
        senders and receivers. This lets senders transmit RTCP reception
        quality reports more often than receivers. If a reporting source in an
        RTCP Reporting Group is a receiver but one or more non-reporting
        SSRCs in the RTCP Reporting Group are senders, then the endpoint <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
        treat the reporting source as a sender for the purpose of RTCP
        bandwidth allocation, increasing its RTCP bandwidth allocation,
        provided it also treats one of the senders as if it were a receiver
        and makes the corresponding reduction in RTCP bandwidth for that SSRC.
        However, the application needs to consider the impact on the frequency
        of transmitting of the synchronization information included in RTCP SRs.</t>

        <name>Identifying Members of an RTCP Reporting Group</name>
        <t>When RTCP Reporting Groups are in use, the other SSRCs in the RTP
        session need to be able to identify which SSRCs are members of an RTCP
        Reporting Group. Two RTCP extensions are defined to support this: the
        RTCP Reporting Group (RGRP) Source Description (SDES) item is used by the reporting source(s) to identify an
        RTCP Reporting Group, and the RTCP RGRS packet is used by other
        members of an RTCP Reporting Group to identify the reporting
        source(s).</t>
        <section anchor="sec-rgrp" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Definition and Use of the RTCP RGRP SDES Item</name>
          <t>This document defines a new RTCP RGRP SDES item to identify an RTCP
          Reporting Group. The motivation for giving a Reporting Group an
          identifier is to ensure that (1)&nbsp;the RTCP Reporting Group and its member
          SSRCs can be correctly associated when there are multiple reporting
          sources and (2)&nbsp;a reporting SSRC can be associated with
          the correct Reporting Group if an SSRC collision occurs.</t>
          <t>This document defines the RTCP RGRP SDES item.
 The RTCP RGRP SDES item <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent by the reporting sources
          in a Reporting Group and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be sent by other members of the
          Reporting Group or by SSRCs that are not members of any RTCP
          Reporting Group. Specifically, every reporting source in an RTCP
          Reporting Group <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include an RTCP SDES packet containing an RGRP
          item in every compound RTCP packet in which it sends an RR or SR
          packet (i.e., in every RTCP packet it sends, unless <xref target="RFC5506" format="default">Reduced-Size RTCP</xref> is in use).</t>

          <t>Syntactically, the format of the RTCP RGRP SDES item is identical
          to that of the <xref target="RFC7022" format="default">RTCP SDES CNAME item</xref>,
          except that the SDES item type field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have value RGRP=11
          instead of CNAME=1. The value of the RTCP RGRP SDES item <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
          chosen with the same concerns about global uniqueness and the same
          privacy considerations as the RTCP SDES CNAME. The value of the RTCP
          RGRP SDES item <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be stable throughout the lifetime of the
          Reporting Group, even if some or all of the reporting sources change
          their SSRC due to collisions or if the set of reporting sources
          changes.</t>
          <t>An RTP mixer or translator that forwards RTCP SR or RR packets
          from members of a Reporting Group <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> forward the corresponding
          RTCP RGRP SDES items as well, even if it otherwise strips SDES items
          other than the CNAME item.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sec-rgrs" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Definition and Use of the RTCP RGRS Packet</name>
          <t>A new RTCP packet type is defined to allow the members of an RTCP
          Reporting Group to identify the reporting sources for that group.
          This allows participants in an RTP session to distinguish an SSRC
          that is sending empty RTCP reception reports because it is a member
          of an RTCP Reporting Group from an SSRC that is sending empty RTCP
          reception reports because it is not receiving any traffic. It also
          explicitly identifies the reporting sources, allowing other members
          of the RTP session to (1)&nbsp;know which SSRCs are acting as the reporting
          sources for an RTCP Reporting Group and (2)&nbsp;detect if
          RTCP packets from any of the reporting sources are being lost.</t>
          <t>The format of the RTCP RGRS packet is defined below. It comprises
          the fixed RTCP header that indicates the packet type and length, the
          SSRC of the packet sender, and a list of reporting sources for the
          RTCP Reporting Group of which the packet sender is a member.</t>

        <t>The use of the RTP/AVPF Feedback Profile <xref target="RFC4585" format="default"/>
        allows SSRCs to send rapid RTCP feedback requests and codec control

        <t>The members of an RTCP Reporting Group will all see identical
        network conditions. Accordingly, one might therefore think that it
        doesn't matter which SSRC in the Reporting Group sends the RTP/AVPF
        feedback or codec control messages. There might be, however, cases
        where the sender of the feedback/codec control message has semantic
        importance, or when only a subset of the members of an RTCP Reporting
        Group might want to send RTP/AVPF feedback or a codec control message
        in response to a particular event. For example, an RTP video sender
        might choose to treat packet loss feedback received from SSRCs known
        to be audio receivers with less urgency than feedback that it receives
        from video receivers when deciding what packets to retransmit, and a
        multimedia receiver using Reporting Groups might want to choose the
        outgoing SSRC for feedback packets to reflect this.</t>
        <t>Each member of an RTCP Reporting Group <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> therefore send
        RTP/AVPF feedback/codec control messages independently of the other
        members of the Reporting Group, to respect the semantic meaning of the
        message sender. The suppression rules of <xref target="RFC4585" format="default"/> will
        ensure that only a single copy of each feedback packet is (typically)
        generated, even if several members of a Reporting Group send the same
        feedback. When an endpoint knows that several members of its RTCP
        Reporting Group will be sending identical feedback and that the
        sender of the feedback is not semantically important, that
        endpoint <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> choose to send all its feedback from the reporting source
        and deterministically suppress feedback packets generated by the other
        sources in the Reporting Group.</t>
        <t>It is important to note that the RTP/AVPF timing rules operate on a
        per-SSRC basis. Using a single reporting source to send all feedback
        for a Reporting Group will hence limit the amount of feedback that can
        be sent to that which can be sent by one SSRC. If this limit is a
        problem, then the Reporting Group can allow each of its members to
        send its own feedback, using its own SSRC.</t>
        <t>If the RTP/AVPF feedback messages or codec control requests are
        sent as compound RTCP packets, then those compound RTCP packets <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
        include either an RTCP RGRS packet or an RTCP RGRP SDES item,
        depending on whether they are sent by the reporting source or a
        non&nbhy;reporting source in the RTCP Reporting Group, respectively. The
        contents of noncompound RTCP feedback or codec control messages are
        not affected by the use of RTCP Reporting Groups.</t>

        <name>Interactions with RTCP Extended Report (XR) Packets</name>
        <t>When using RTCP Extended Report (XR) packets <xref target="RFC3611" format="default"/> with
        RTCP Reporting Groups, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the reporting source be
        used to send the RTCP XR packets. If multiple reporting sources are in
        use, the reporting source that sends the SR/RR packets that relate to
        a particular remote SSRC <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send the RTCP XR reports about that
        SSRC. This is motivated as one commonly combine the RTCP XR metrics
        with the regular report block to more fully understand the situation.
        Receiving these blocks in different compound packets reduces their
        value, as the measuring intervals are not synchronized in those
        cases.</t>
        <t>Some RTCP XR report blocks are specific to particular types of
        media and might be relevant to only some members of a Reporting
        Group. For example, it would make no sense for an SSRC that is
        receiving video to send a Voice over IP (VoIP) metric RTCP XR report block. Such
        media-specific RTCP XR report blocks <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent by the SSRC to which they
        are relevant and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be included in the common report sent by
        the reporting source. This might mean that some SSRCs send RTCP XR
        packets in compound RTCP packets that contain an empty RTCP SR/RR
        packet and that the time period covered by the RTCP XR packet is
        different from that covered by the RTCP SR/RR packet. If it is important
        that the RTCP XR packet and RTCP SR/RR packet cover the same time
        period, then that source <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be removed from the RTCP Reporting
        Group, and standard RTCP packets be sent instead.</t>

        <name>Middlebox Considerations</name>
        <t>Many different types of middleboxes are used with RTP. RTCP Reporting
        Groups are potentially relevant to those types of RTP middleboxes that
        have their own SSRCs and generate RTCP reports for the traffic they
        receive. RTP middleboxes that do not have their own SSRC and that do not
        send RTCP reports on the traffic they receive cannot use the
        RTCP Reporting Group extension, since they generate no RTCP reports
        to that group.</t>
        <t>An RTP middlebox that has several SSRCs of its own can use the RTCP
        Reporting Group extension to group the RTCP reports it generates.
        This can occur, for example, if a middlebox is acting as an RTP mixer
        for both audio and video flows that are multiplexed onto a single RTP
        session, where the middlebox has one SSRC for the audio mixer and one
        for the video mixer part, and when the middlebox wants to avoid
        cross-reporting between audio and video.</t>
        <t>A middlebox cannot use the RTCP Reporting Group extension to group
        RTCP packets from the SSRCs that it is forwarding. It can, however,
        group the RTCP packets from the SSRCs it is forwarding into compound
        RTCP packets, following the rules in <xref target="RFC3550" sectionFormat="of" section="6.1"/> and <xref target="RFC8108" sectionFormat="of" section="5.3"/>. If the middlebox is
        using RTCP Reporting Groups for its own SSRCs, it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include RTCP
        packets from the SSRCs that it is forwarding as part of the compound
        RTCP packets its reporting source generates.</t>
        <t>A middlebox that forwards RTCP SR or RR packets sent by members of
        a Reporting Group <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> forward the corresponding RTCP
        RGRP SDES items,
        as described in <xref target="sec-rgrp" format="default"/>. A middlebox that forwards
        RTCP SR or RR packets sent by members of a Reporting Group <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also
        forward the corresponding RTCP RGRS packets, as described in <xref target="sec-rgrs" format="default"/>. Failure to forward these packets can cause
        compatibility problems, as described in <xref target="compat" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>If a middlebox rewrites SSRC values in the RTP and RTCP packets
        that it is forwarding, then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> make the corresponding changes in
        RTCP SDES packets containing RGRP items and in RTCP RGRS packets, to
        allow them to be associated with the rewritten SSRCs.</t>

      <name>Properties of RTCP Reporting Groups</name>
      <t>This section provides additional information on what the resulting
      properties are (i.e., resulting effects or impacts) as related to the design specified in <xref target="reportgroups"
      format="default"/>. The content of this section is

      <section anchor="reportgroups-bw" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Bandwidth Benefits of RTCP Reporting Groups</name>
        <t>To understand the benefits of RTCP Reporting Groups, consider a
        scenario in which the two endpoints in a session each have a hundred
        sources, of which eight each are sending within any given reporting
        interval.</t>
        <t>For ease of analysis, we can make the simplifying approximation
        that the duration of the RTCP reporting interval is equal to the total
        size of the RTCP packets sent during an RTCP interval, divided by the
        RTCP bandwidth. (This will be approximately true in scenarios where
        the bandwidth is not so high that the minimum RTCP interval is
        reached.) To further simplify, we can assume that RTCP senders are
        following the recommendations regarding compound RTCP packets in <xref target="RFC8108" format="default"/>; thus, the per-packet
        transport-layer overhead will be small relative to the RTCP data.
        Thus, only the actual RTCP data itself need be considered.</t>
        <t>In a report interval in this scenario, there will, as a baseline,
        be 200 SDES packets, 184 RR packets, and 16 SR packets. This amounts
        to approximately 6.5 KB of RTCP packets per report interval, assuming 16-byte
        CNAMEs and no other SDES information.</t>
        <t>Using the original "everyone reports on every sender" feedback rules
        <xref target="RFC3550" format="default"/>, each of the 184
        receivers will send 16 report blocks, and each of the 16 senders will
        send 15. This amounts to approximately 76 KB of report block traffic
        per interval; 92% of RTCP traffic consists of report blocks.</t>
        <t>If Reporting Groups are used, however, there is only 0.4 KB of
        reports per interval, with no loss of useful information.
        Additionally, there will be (assuming 16-byte RGRPs and a single
        reporting source per Reporting Group) an additional 2.4 KB per cycle
        of RTCP RGRP SDES items and RGRS packets. Put another way, the unmodified
        reporting interval per <xref target="RFC3550" format="default"/> is approximately 9 times
        longer than if Reporting Groups are in use.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="compat" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Compatibility of RTCP Reporting Groups</name>
        <t>The RTCP traffic generated by receivers using RTCP Reporting Groups
        might appear, to observers unaware of these semantics, to be generated
        by receivers who are experiencing a network disconnection, as the
        non-reporting sources appear not to be receiving a given sender at
        all.</t>
        <t>This could be a potentially critical problem for such a sender
        using RTCP for congestion control, as such a sender might think that
        it is sending so much traffic that it is causing complete congestion
        collapse.</t>
        <t>However, such an interpretation of the session statistics would
        require a fairly sophisticated RTCP analysis. Any receiver of RTCP
        statistics that is just interested in information about itself needs
        to be prepared for the possibility that any given reception report might not contain
        information about a specific media source, because reception reports
        in large conferences can be round-robined.</t>
        <t>Thus, the extent to which such backward-compatibility
        issues would actually cause trouble in practice is unclear.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC3550" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8108" format="default"/> apply. If the RTP/AVPF
      profile is in use, then the security considerations of <xref target="RFC4585" format="default"/> (and <xref target="RFC5104" format="default"/>, if used) also apply.
      If RTCP XR is used, the security considerations of <xref
      target="RFC3611" format="default"/>, including security considerations regarding any XR report blocks used, also apply.</t>
      <t>The RTCP RGRP SDES item is vulnerable to malicious modifications
      unless integrity protection is used. A modification of this item's length
      field causes the parsing of the RTCP packet in which it is contained to
      fail. Depending on the implementation, parsing of the full compound RTCP
      packet can also fail, causing the whole packet to be discarded. A
      modification of the value of this SDES item would make the receiver of
      the report think that the sender of the report was a member of a
      different RTCP Reporting Group. This will potentially create an
      inconsistency, when the RGRS reports the source as being in the same
      Reporting Group as another source with another Reporting Group
      identifier. The impacts on a receiver implementation that such
      inconsistencies could cause are difficult to fully predict. One case is
      that when congestion control or other adaptation mechanisms are used, an
      inconsistent report can result in a media sender reducing its bitrate.
      However, a direct modification of the RR or a feedback
      message itself would be a more efficient attack and would be equally costly to
      perform.</t>
      <t>The new RGRS RTCP packet type is very simple. The common RTCP packet
      type header shares the same security risks as those that affect previous RTCP packet types.
      Errors or modification of the length field can cause the full compound
      packet to fail header validation (see <xref target="RFC3550" sectionFormat="of" section="A.2"/>), resulting in the whole compound RTCP packet being
      discarded. Modification of the SC field or the P field would cause an inconsistency
      when processing the RTCP packet, likely resulting in the packet being classified as
      invalid. A modification of the PT field would cause the packet to be
      interpreted according to some other packet type's rules. In such a case, the
      result might be more or less predictable but would be specific to the packet type.
      Modification of the "SSRC of packet sender" field would attribute this packet to
      another sender, resulting in a receiver believing that the Reporting
      Group also applies for this SSRC, if it exists. If it doesn't exist, unless
      corresponding modifications are also done on an SR/RR packet and an SDES
      packet, the RTCP packet <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be discarded. If consistent changes are
      done, such a scenario could be part of a resource exhaustion attack on a receiver
      implementation. Modification of the "List of SSRCs for the Reporting
      Source(s)" field would change the SSRC the receiver expects to report on behalf
      of this SSRC. If that SSRC exists, this situation could potentially change the
      Reporting Group used for this SSRC. A change to another Reporting Group
      belonging to another endpoint is likely detectable, as there would be a
      mismatch between the SSRC of the packet sender's endpoint information,
      transport addresses, SDES CNAME, etc., and the corresponding information
      from the Reporting Group indicated.</t>
      <t>In general, the Reporting Group is providing limited-impact attacks
      on the endpoints.  The most significant result from a deliberate attack would be to cause
      the information to be discarded or be inconsistent, including the 
      discarding of
      all RTCP packets that are modified. This causes a lack of information at
      any receiver entity, possibly disregarding the endpoint's participation
      in the session.</t>
      <t>To protect against such attacks from external non-trusted
      entities, integrity and source authentication <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be applied. This
      can be done, for example, by using <xref target="RFC3711"
      format="default">the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)</xref>
      with appropriate key management; other options exist, as discussed in
      <xref target="RFC7201" format="default">"Options for Securing RTP Sessions"</xref>.</t>
      <t>The Reporting Group Identifier has properties that could potentially
      impact privacy. If this identifier were to be generated by an implementation in a 
      way that makes it long-term stable or predictable, it could be used for
      tracking a particular endpoint. Therefore, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that it be
      generated as a short-term persistent RGRP, following the rules for
      short-term persistent CNAMEs in <xref target="RFC7022" format="default"/>. The rest of
      the information revealed, i.e., the SSRCs, the size of the Reporting Group,
      and the number of reporting sources in a Reporting Group, is of a less
      sensitive nature, considering that the SSRCs and the communication would
      be revealed without this extension anyway. By encrypting the Reporting
      Group extensions, the confidentiality of the SSRC values would be preserved, but
      the values can
      still be revealed if <xref target="RFC3711" format="default">SRTP</xref>
      is used. The
      size of the Reporting Groups and the number of reporting sources are
      likely determinable from analysis of the packet pattern and sizes. However,
      this information appears to have limited value.</t>
