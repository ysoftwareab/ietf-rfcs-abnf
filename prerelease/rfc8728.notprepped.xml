        The RFC Editor model described in this document divides the
        responsibilities for the RFC Series into three functions: the RFC
        Series Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher.
        Internet Architecture Board (IAB) oversight via the RFC Series
        Oversight Committee (RSOC) is described, as is the relationship
        between the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company
        and the RSOC.  This document reflects the experience gained
        with "RFC Editor Model (Version 1)", documented in RFC 5620; and
        obsoletes RFC 6635 to replace all references to the 
        IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) and
        related structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0 Model.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document reflects the experience gained with "RFC Editor
    Model (Version 1)", documented in <xref target="RFC5620" format="default"/>, and
    updates the RFC Editor Model (Version 2) to be aligned with the new
    IASA 2.0 Model <xref target="RFC8711" format="default"/> that creates the
    IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC) managed by
    a board of directors (IETF LLC Board).  As part of the IASA 2.0 Model,
    the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) is eliminated,
    and its oversight and advising functions transferred to the new IETF LLC.
    This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC6635" format="default"/> to replace all
    references to the IASA and related structures with those defined by
    the IASA 2.0 Model.</t>
      <t>
     The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is concerned
     with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series, orderly RFC Editor
     succession, RFC quality, and RFC document accessibility. The IAB is
     also sensitive to the concerns of the IETF LLC about providing the
     necessary services in a cost-effective and efficient manner.
      </t>
      <t>
     The previous RFC Editor model <xref target="RFC5620" format="default"/> was first
     approved by the IAB in October 2008, and our understanding of the model has
     evolved with our experience since. During the implementation of
     version 1 of the model <xref target="RFC5620" format="default"/>, it was quickly
     realized that the role of the RFC Series Editor (RSE) and the
     oversight responsibilities needed to be structured differently. In
     order to gain experience with "running code", a transitional RSE was
     hired who analyzed the managerial environment and provided
     recommendations. This was followed by the appointment of an acting
     RSE, who ably managed the series while work was undertaken to select
     and hire a permanent RSE.  This version of the model is based on the
     recommendations of both temporary RFC Series Editors and the
     extensive discussion in the IETF community, on the rfc-interest
     list, and within the IAB.
      </t>
      <t>
     This document, and the resulting structures, will be modified as
     needed through normal procedures.  The RSE, and the IAB, through the
     RFC Series Oversight Committee (see <xref target="RSOC" format="default"/>), will continue
     to monitor discussions within the community about potential
     adjustments to the RFC Editor model and recognize that the process
     described in this document may need to be adjusted to align with any
     changes that result from such discussions; hence, the version number
     in the title.
      </t>
      <t>
     The IAB maintains its responsibilities as defined in <xref target="RFC2850" format="default"/>.

        The RFC Series is described in <xref target="RFC8729" format="default"/>.  Its
        Section <xref target="RFC8729" section="3.1" sectionFormat="bare" format="default"/> defines "RFC Editor":
        </t>
        <blockquote>
          <t>
     Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC
     Series (the RFC Editor). The task has grown, and the work now
     requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are
     RFC Editors, or an RFC Editor organization. In time, there may be
     multiple organizations working together to undertake the work
     required by the RFC Series. For simplicity's sake, and without
     attempting to predict how the role might be subdivided among them,
     this document refers to this collection of experts and 
     organizations as the "RFC Editor".</t>
          <t>     
     The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor,
     acting to support the mission of the RFC Series. As such, the RFC
     Editor is the implementer handling the editorial management of the
     RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes. In addition,
     the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime mover in
     discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving
     RFCs.</t>
        </blockquote>
        <t>
RFC 8729 does not explore the internal organization of the RFC
Editor. However, RFC 8729 envisions changes in the RFC Editor
organizational structure. There have been several iterations on
efforts to improve and clarify this structure.  These have been
led by the IAB, in consultation with the community and many
leadership bodies within the community.  This first resulted in
the publication of <xref target="RFC5620" format="default"/> and then in further
discussions leading to the publication of <xref target="RFC6635" format="default"/>.  Some of the details on
this evolution can be found below.  In undertaking this
evolution, the IAB considered changes that increase flexibility
and operational support options, provide for the orderly
succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the continuity of the
RFC Series, while maintaining RFC quality, maintaining timely
processing, ensuring document accessibility, reducing costs, and
increasing cost transparency. The model set forth below describes
the internal organization of the RFC Editor, while remaining
consistent with RFC 8729.
        </t>
        <t>
Note that RFC 8729 uses the term "RFC Editor function" or "RFC
Editor" as the collective set of responsibilities for which
this memo provides a model for internal organization. This
memo defines the term "RFC Series Editor" or "Series
Editor" for one of the organizational components.

The RFC Editor model divides the responsibilities for
the RFC Series into the following components:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>RFC Series Editor (RSE)</li>
        <li>RFC Production Center</li>

The structure and relationship of the components of the RFC
Series production and process is schematically represented by 
<xref target="model-figure" format="default"/>. The picture does not depict oversight and
escalation relations.  It does include the streams and their
managers (which are not part of the RFC Series Editor, the RFC
Production Center, or Publisher facilities) in order to more
fully show the context in which the RFC Series Editor operates.

In this model, documents are produced and approved through
multiple document streams.  The stream manager for each stream is
responsible for the content of that stream.  The four streams
that now exist are described in <xref target="RFC8729" format="default"/>.  The
RFC Editor function is responsible for the packaging and
distribution of the documents.  As such, documents from these
streams are edited and processed by the Production Center and
published by the Publisher.  The RFC Series Editor will exercise
strategic leadership and management over the activities of the
RFC Publisher and the RFC Production Center (both of which can be
seen as back-office functions) and will be the entity that:

        More details on the
        oversight by the IAB via the RFC Series Oversight Committee 
        (RSOC) can be found in <xref target="RSOC" format="default"/>.  For example,
the RSE does not have the direct authority to

        reviews of the RFC Production Center and Publisher function,
        which are then provided to the RSOC, the IETF LLC, and the community.
        Normally, private financial details would not be included in a

      cross-stream coordination of priorities.  Issues that require
      changes to the budget or contracts shall be brought to the

    meeting.  As described in <xref target="RSOC" format="default"/>, the RSE reports the
    results of such interactions to the RSOC, including a description of
    the outreach efforts and the specific recommendations on policy.
    This enables the RSOC to provide the oversight the IAB is required to
    apply, as well as to confirm that the Internet community has been

          is the need to develop and improve those functions.  The RSE is

          <t>This effort must include the dimensions of document quality,

          <name>Development of the RFC Series</name>
          <t>In order to develop the RFC Series, the RSE is expected to
      develop a relationship with the Internet technical community.  The
      Editor is expected to engage with the Internet technical community
      in a process of articulating and refining a vision for the series
      and its continuous evolution.  The RSE is also expected to engage
      other users of the RFC Series, in particular, the consumers of
      these documents, such as those people who use them to specify
      products, write code, test behaviors, or other related
      activities.</t>

<ul empty="true">
<li><t>The RSE is responsible for the coordination of discussion on
       series evolution among the series' stream participants and the
       broader Internet technical community.</t>
       <t>In time, the RSE is expected to develop and refine a vision for
      the RFC Series, including examining:</t>
              <ul spacing="normal">
                <li>The RFC Series, as it continues to evolve.  The RSE is
         expected to take a broad view and look for the best ways to
         evolve the series for the benefit of the entire Internet
         community.  As such, the RSE may even consider evolution beyond
         the historical 'by engineers for engineers' emphasis; and</li>
                <li>Its publication-technical environment, by looking at whether
         it should be slowly changing in terms of publishing and
         archiving techniques -- particularly to better serve the
         communities that produce and depend on the RFC Series.  For
         example, all of those communities have been slowly changing to
         include a significant population of multi-lingual individuals or
         non-native speakers of English.  Another example is that some of
         these constituencies also have shifted to include significant
         groups whose primary focus is on the constraints and
         consequences of network engineering, rather than a primary
         interest in the engineering issues themselves.</li>
              </ul>
</li>
</ul>
          <t>For this type of responsibility, the RSE cooperates closely with
   the community, and operates under oversight of the RSOC: thus,
   ultimately, under oversight of the IAB.</t>

        <name>RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC)</name>
        <t>The IAB is responsible for the oversight of the RFC Series and
    acts as a body for final conflict resolution, including the
    process described in <xref target="dispute" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>In order to provide continuity over periods longer than the NomCom
    appointment cycle <xref target="RFC8713" format="default"/> and assure that oversight includes suitable
    subject matter expertise, the IAB will establish a group that implements
    oversight for the IAB, the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC).</t>
        <t>The RSOC will act with authority delegated from the IAB: in general,
    it will be the RSOC that will approve consensus policy and vision
    documents as developed by the RSE in collaboration with the
    community.  While it is expected that the IAB will exercise due
    diligence in its supervision of the RSOC,  the RSOC should be
    allowed the latitude to do its job without undue interference
    from the IAB.  Therefore, it is expected that the IAB
    will accord RSOC reports and recommendations the benefit of
    the doubt.</t>

    <t>
   For all decisions that affect the RSE individually (e.g., hiring and 
   firing), the RSOC prepares recommendations for the IAB.  The final 
   recommendation to the IETF LLC is the responsibility of the IAB, after 
   discussion with RSOC on the recommendations.

   For instance the RSOC would do the following:
</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>perform annual reviews of the RSE and report the result of 
     these reviews to the IAB.</li>
          <li> manage RSE candidate selection and advise the IAB on candidate
     appointment (in other words, select the RSE subject to IAB
     approval).</li>
        </ul>
        <t>RSOC members are expected to recognize potential conflicts of
   interest and behave accordingly.</t>
        <t>For the actual recruitment and selection of the RSE, the RSOC will
   propose a budget for the search process. It will work with the IETF LLC
   to refine that budget and develop remuneration criteria and an
   employment agreement or contracting plans, as appropriate.
        </t>
        <t>The RSOC will be responsible for ensuring that the RFC Series is run in
   a transparent and accountable manner.</t>
        <t>The RSOC shall develop and publish its own rules of order.</t>
        <t>The initial RSOC was charged with designing and executing a
   solicitation, search, and selection process for the first actual (not
   transitional or "acting") RSE appointment. That process involved
   iteration on this and related documents and evaluation of various
   strategies and options.  During the creation of what became <xref target="RFC6635" format="default"/>, it was
   expected that the RSOC would describe the process it ultimately
   selected to the community.  The RSOC did involve the community in
   interim considerations when that was likely to be of value. Following
   completion of the selection process, the RSOC will determine the best
   way to share information learned and experience gained with the
   community and determine how to best preserve that information for
   future use.
        </t>
        <section anchor="RSOCCompose" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>RSOC Composition</name>
          <t>
   The RSOC will operate under the authority of the IAB, with the IAB 
   retaining final responsibility.  The IAB will delegate authority and
   responsibility to the RSOC as appropriate and as RSOC and RSE
   relationships evolve.  The RSOC will include people who are not
   current IAB members.  Currently, this is aligned with the IAB
   program structure.   The IAB will designate the
   membership of the RSOC with the following goals: preserving effective
   stability; keeping it small enough to be effective, and keeping it large enough
   to provide general Internet community expertise, specific IETF
   expertise, publication expertise, and stream expertise.  Members
   serve at the pleasure of the IAB and are expected to bring a balance
   between short- and long-term perspectives.  Specific input about, and
   recommendations of, members will be sought from the streams, the
   IETF LLC, and the RSE.</t>
          <t>In addition to the members from outside of the IAB appointed to the
   RSOC, IAB members may participate as full members of the RSOC.  Under
   most circumstances, there will be a specific individual IAB member
   appointed by the IAB as the program lead, who will be a full member of
   the RSOC.  This member's role is distinct from any RSOC-internal
   organizational roles, such as would be created by the RSOC choosing to
   appoint a chair from among its members.  Other IAB members may choose
   to be full members of the RSOC, with the consent of the IAB.  This
   consent is primarily concerned with avoiding overpopulating the RSOC
   and providing it with relatively stable membership, which will work
   best if it is not too large a committee.</t>
          <t>The IETF LLC will appoint an individual to serve as its liaison to
   the RSOC.  The RSE and the IETF LLC Liaison will serve as
   non-voting ex officio members of the RSOC.  Either or both can be
   excluded from its discussions if necessary.</t>

        <name>Disagreements among Entities Related to the RFC Editor</name>
        <t>The RFC Series Editor and the RFC Production Center and
Publisher facilities work with the various streams to produce
RFCs.  Disagreements may arise between these entities during the
execution of the RFC Editor operations. In particular, different
streams may disagree with each other, or disagree with the RFC
Editor function. Potentially, even the RSOC or the IETF LLC
could find themselves in disagreement with some aspect of the RFC
Editor operations.  Note that disagreements between an author and
the RFC Production Center are not cross-entity issues, and they
are to be resolved by the RSE, in accordance with the rest of
this document.
        </t>
        <t>
        If such cross-entity disagreements arise, the community would
        generally hope that they can be resolved politely and directly.
        However, this is not always possible. At that point, any relevant
        party would first formally request a review and reconsideration
        of the decision. If the party still disagrees after the
        reconsideration, that party may ask the RSE to decide or,
        especially if the RSE is involved, the party may ask the IAB
        Chair (for a technical or procedural matter) to mediate or
        appoint a mediator to aid in the discussions, although he or she
        not is obligated to do so. All parties should work informally and
        in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion.  As noted
        below, any such issues that involve contractual matters must be
        brought to the attention of the IETF LLC.  If the IAB Chair is
        asked to assist in resolving the matter, the Chair may ask for
        advice or seek assistance from anyone the Chair deems helpful.
        The Chair may also alert any appropriate individuals or
        organizations to the existence of the issue.

  If such a conclusion is not possible through the above less formal
  processes, then the matter must be registered with the RFC
  Series Oversight Committee. The RSOC may choose to offer advice
  to the RSE or more general advice to the parties involved
  and may ask the RSE to defer a decision until it formulates
  its advice. However, if a timely decision cannot be reached
  through discussion, mediation, and mutual agreement, the
  RSE is expected to make whatever decisions are
  needed to ensure the smooth operation of the RFC Editor
  function; those decisions are final.
        </t>
        <t>
  The RSE may make final decisions unilaterally only to assure
  the functioning of the process, and only while there is an
  evaluation of current policies to determine whether they are
  appropriately implemented in the decision or need
  adjustment. In particular, it should be noted that final
  decisions about the technical content of individual documents
  are the exclusive responsibility of the stream approvers from
  which those documents originate, as shown in the illustration
  in <xref target="model-figure" format="default"/>.


        </t>
        <t>
  If informal agreements cannot be reached, then formal RSOC
  review and decision making may be required.  If so, the
  RSE must present the issues involved to the community
          so that the community is aware of the situation.  The RSE
          will then report the issue to the RSOC for formal resolution
          by the RSOC with confirmation by the IAB in its oversight
          capacity.
        </t>
        <t>
  IAB and community discussion of any patterns of disputes are
  expected to inform future changes to RFC Series policies,
  including possible updates to this document.

         If a disagreement or decision has immediate or future
 contractual consequences, it falls under
 <xref target="RFC8711" format="default"/>.  If this happens, the RSE must
 identify the issue and provide advice to the IETF LLC.
         Additionally, if the RSOC has also developed advice, it should
 forward that advice to the IETF LLC.</t>

      <name>IANA Considerations</name>
      <t>
      This document defines several functions within the overall
      RFC Editor structure, and it places the responsibility for
      coordination of registry value assignments with the RFC
      Production Center. The IETF LLC will facilitate the establishment
      of the relationship between the RFC Production Center and IANA.
      </t>
      <t>
      This document does not create a new registry nor does it
      register any values in existing registries, and no IANA action
      is required.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
      The same security considerations as those in <xref target="RFC8729" format="default"/> apply. The
      processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
      introduction of unapproved changes. Since the RFC Editor 
      maintains the index of publications, sufficient security must be
      in place to prevent these published documents from being changed
      by external parties. The archive of RFC documents, any source
      documents needed to recreate the RFC documents, and any
      associated original documents (such as lists of errata, tools,
      and, for some early items, originals that are not
      machine readable) need to be secured against any kind of data
      storage failure. 
      </t>
      <t>
     The IETF LLC should take these security considerations into
     account during the implementation and enforcement of the RFC
     Editor component contracts.

      The RFC Editor model was conceived and discussed in hallways and

      document is based was first written by Leslie Daigle, Russ
      Housley, and Ray Pelletier. In addition to the members of the
      IAOC and IAB in conjunction with those roles, major and minor
      contributions were made by (in alphabetical order): <contact fullname="Bob Braden"/>,
