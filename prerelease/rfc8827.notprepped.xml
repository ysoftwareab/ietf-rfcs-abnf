        The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTCWEB) Working Group
        standardized protocols for real-time communications between Web
        browsers, generally called "WebRTC" <xref target="RFC8825" format="default"/>.
        The major use cases for WebRTC technology are real-time audio
        and/or video calls, Web conferencing, and direct data transfer. Unlike
        most conventional real-time systems (e.g., SIP-based <xref target="RFC3261" format="default"/> soft phones), WebRTC communications are directly
        controlled by some Web server, via a JavaScript (JS) API as shown in
        <xref target="fig.simple" format="default"/>.

        A more complicated system might allow for inter-domain calling, as shown
        in <xref target="fig.multidomain" format="default"/>.  The protocol to be used between
        the domains is not standardized by WebRTC, but given the installed base
        and the form of the WebRTC API is likely to be something SDP-based like
        SIP or something like the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)

      <name>Trust Model</name>
      <t>
        The basic assumption of this architecture is that network resources
        exist in a hierarchy of trust, rooted in the browser, which serves as
        the user's Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Any security property which the
        user wishes to have enforced must be ultimately guaranteed by the
        browser (or transitively by some property the browser
        verifies). Conversely, if the browser is compromised, then no security
        guarantees are possible.  Note that there are cases (e.g., Internet
        kiosks) where the user can't really trust the browser that much. In
        these cases, the level of security provided is limited by how much they
        trust the browser.
      </t>
      <t>
        Optimally, we would not rely on trust in any entities other than the
        browser. However, this is unfortunately not possible if we wish to have
        a functional system.  Other network elements fall into two categories:
        those which can be authenticated by the browser and thus can be granted
        permissions to access sensitive resources, and those which cannot be
        authenticated and thus are untrusted.
      </t>
      <section anchor="sec.proposal.authenticated" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Authenticated Entities</name>
        <t>
          There are two major classes of authenticated entities in the system:
        </t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>Calling services:</dt>
           <dd>Web sites whose origin we can verify (optimally
              via HTTPS, but in some cases because we are on a topologically
              restricted network, such as behind a firewall, and can infer
              authentication from firewall behavior).</dd>
           <dt>Other users:</dt>
            <dd>WebRTC peers whose origin we can verify
              cryptographically (optimally via DTLS-SRTP).</dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
          Note that merely being authenticated does not make these entities
          trusted. For instance, just because we can verify that
          &lt;https://www.example.org/&gt; is owned by Dr. Evil does not mean that we can
          trust Dr. Evil to access our camera and microphone. However, it gives
          the user an opportunity to determine whether they wish to trust
          Dr. Evil or not; after all, if they desire to contact Dr. Evil (perhaps
          to arrange for ransom payment), it's safe to temporarily give them
          access to the camera and microphone for the purpose of the call, but
          they don't want Dr. Evil to be able to access their camera and
          microphone other than during the call. The point here is that we must
          first identify other elements before we can determine whether and how
          much to trust them. Additionally, sometimes we need to identify the
          communicating peer before we know what policies to apply.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec.proposal.unauthenticated" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Unauthenticated Entities</name>
        <t>
          Other than the above entities, we are not generally able to identify
          other network elements; thus, we cannot trust them.  This does not mean
          that it is not possible to have any interaction with them, but it
          means that we must assume that they will behave maliciously and design
          a system which is secure even if they do so.

    <section anchor="sec.proposal.overview" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Overview</name>
      <t>
        This section describes a typical WebRTC session and shows how the
        various security elements interact and what guarantees are provided to
        the user. The example in this section is a "best case" scenario in which
        we provide the maximal amount of user authentication and media privacy
        with the minimal level of trust in the calling service. Simpler versions
        with lower levels of security are also possible and are noted in the
        text where applicable. It's also important to recognize the tension
        between security (or performance) and privacy. The example shown here is
        aimed towards settings where we are more concerned about secure calling
        than about privacy, but as we shall see, there are settings where one
        might wish to make different tradeoffs -- this architecture is still
        compatible with those settings.
      </t>
      <t>
        For the purposes of this example, we assume the topology shown in the
        figures below. This topology is derived from the topology shown in <xref target="fig.simple" format="default"/>, but separates Alice's and Bob's identities from the
        process of signaling.  Specifically, Alice and Bob have relationships
        with some Identity Provider (IdP) that supports a protocol (such as
        OpenID Connect) that can be used to demonstrate their identity to
        other parties. For instance, Alice might have an account with a social
        network which she can then use to authenticate to other Web sites
        without explicitly having an account with those sites; this is a fairly
        conventional pattern on the Web. <xref target="sec.trust-relationships" format="default"/> provides an overview of IdPs
        and the relevant terminology.  Alice and Bob might have
        relationships with different IdPs as well.
        Note: The IdP mechanism described here has not seen wide adoption.
        See <xref target="sec.generic.idp"/> for more on the status of
        IdP-based authentication.
      </t>
      <t>
        This separation of identity provision and signaling isn't particularly
        important in "closed world" cases where Alice and Bob are users on the
        same social network and have identities based on that domain (<xref target="fig.proposal.idp" format="default"/>). However, there are important settings where
        that is not the case, such as federation (calls from one domain to
        another; see <xref target="fig.proposal-federated.idp" format="default"/>) and calling on
        untrusted sites, such as where two users who have a relationship via a
        given social network want to call each other on another, untrusted,
        site, such as a poker site.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that the servers themselves are also authenticated by an external
        identity service, the SSL/TLS certificate infrastructure (not shown).
        As is conventional in the Web, all identities are ultimately rooted in
        that system. For instance, when an IdP makes an identity assertion, the
        Relying Party consuming that assertion is able to verify because it is
        able to connect to the IdP via HTTPS.

          For simplicity, assume the topology in <xref target="fig.proposal.idp" format="default"/>.  Alice and Bob are both users of a common
          calling service; they both have approved the calling service to make
          calls (we defer the discussion of device access permissions until
          later).  They are both connected to the calling service via HTTPS and
          so know the origin with some level of confidence. They also have
          accounts with some IdP.  This sort of identity service
          is becoming increasingly common in the Web environment (with technologies
          such as Federated Google Login, Facebook Connect, OAuth,
          OpenID, WebFinger), and is often provided as a side effect service of
          a user's ordinary accounts with some service. In this example, we show
          Alice and Bob using a separate identity service, though the identity
          service may be the same entity as the calling service or there may be
          no identity service at all.

          Alice is logged onto the calling service and decides to call Bob. She
          can see from the calling service that he is online and the calling
          service presents a JS UI in the form of a button next to Bob's name
          which says "Call". Alice clicks the button, which initiates a JS
          callback that instantiates a PeerConnection object. This does not
          require a security check: JS from any origin is allowed to get this
          far.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once the PeerConnection is created, the calling service JS needs to
          set up some media. Because this is an audio/video call, it creates a
          MediaStream with two MediaStreamTracks, one connected to an audio
          input and one connected to a video input. At this point, the first
          security check is required: untrusted origins are not allowed to
          access the camera and microphone, so the browser prompts Alice for
          permission.
        </t>
        <t>
          In the current W3C API, once some streams have been added, Alice's
          browser + JS generates a signaling message <xref target="RFC8829" format="default"/> containing:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
              Media channel information
          </li>
          <li>
              Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/> candidates
          </li>
          <li>
              A "fingerprint" attribute binding the communication to a key pair
              <xref target="RFC5763" format="default"/>. Note that this key may simply be
              ephemerally generated for this call or specific to this domain,
              and Alice may have a large number of such keys.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          Prior to sending out the signaling message, the PeerConnection code
          contacts the identity service and obtains an assertion binding Alice's
          identity to her fingerprint. The exact details depend on the identity
          service (though as discussed in <xref target="sec.generic.idp" format="default"/>
          PeerConnection can be agnostic to them), but for now it's easiest to
          think of as an OAuth token.  The assertion may bind other
          information to the identity besides the fingerprint, but at minimum it
          needs to bind the fingerprint.
        </t>
        <t>
          This message is sent to the signaling server, e.g., by fetch()
          <xref target="fetch" format="default"/> or by WebSockets
          <xref target="RFC6455" format="default"/>, over TLS <xref
          target="RFC8446" format="default"/>.
          The signaling server processes the message from Alice's browser,
          determines that this is a call to Bob, and sends a signaling message to
          Bob's browser (again, the format is currently undefined).  The JS on
          Bob's browser processes it, and alerts Bob to the incoming call and to
          Alice's identity. In this case, Alice has provided an identity
          assertion and so Bob's browser contacts Alice's IdP
          (again, this is done in a generic way so the browser has no specific
          knowledge of the IdP) to verify the assertion. It is also possible
          to have IdPs with which the browser has a specific trust relationship,
          as described in <xref target="sec.trust-relationships" format="default"/>.
          This allows the browser
          to display a trusted element in the browser chrome indicating that a
          call is coming in from Alice. If Alice is in Bob's address book, then
          this interface might also include her real name, a picture, etc.  The
          calling site will also provide some user interface element (e.g., a
          button) to allow Bob to answer the call, though this is most likely
          not part of the trusted UI.
        </t>
        <t>
          If Bob agrees, a PeerConnection is instantiated with the message from
          Alice's side.  Then, a similar process occurs as on Alice's browser:
          Bob's browser prompts him for device permission, the media streams are
          created, and a return signaling message containing media information,
          ICE candidates, and a fingerprint is sent back to Alice via the
          signaling service.  If Bob has a relationship with an IdP, the message
          will also come with an identity assertion.
        </t>
        <t>
          At this point, Alice and Bob each know that the other party wants to
          have a secure call with them. Based purely on the interface provided
          by the signaling server, they know that the signaling server claims
          that the call is from Alice to Bob. This level of security is provided
          merely by having the fingerprint in the message and having that
          message received securely from the signaling server.  Because the far
          end sent an identity assertion along with their message, they know
          that this is verifiable from the IdP as well. Note that if the call is
          federated, as shown in <xref target="fig.proposal-federated.idp" format="default"/>,
          then Alice is able to verify Bob's identity in a way that is not
          mediated by either her signaling server or Bob's. Rather, she verifies
          it directly with Bob's IdP.
        </t>
        <t>
          Of course, the call works perfectly well if either Alice or Bob
          doesn't have a relationship with an IdP; they just get a lower level
          of assurance. I.e., they simply have whatever information their
          calling site claims about the caller/callee's identity.  Moreover,
          Alice might wish to make an anonymous call through an anonymous
          calling site, in which case she would of course just not provide any
          identity assertion and the calling site would mask her identity from
          Bob.

        <t>
          As described in <xref target="RFC8826" sectionFormat="comma"
          section="4.2"/>, media consent verification is provided via ICE.
  Thus, Alice and
          Bob perform ICE checks with each other.  At the completion of these
          checks, they are ready to send non-ICE data.
        </t>
        <t>
          At this point, Alice knows that (a) Bob (assuming he is verified via
          his IdP) or someone else who the signaling service is claiming is Bob
          is willing to exchange traffic with her and (b) either Bob is at
          the IP address which she has verified via ICE or there is an attacker
          who is on-path to that IP address detouring the traffic. Note that it
          is not possible for an attacker who is on-path between Alice and Bob
          but not attached to the signaling service to spoof these checks
          because they do not have the ICE credentials. Bob has the same
          security guarantees with respect to Alice.

        <name>DTLS Handshake</name>
        <t>
          Once the requisite ICE checks have completed, Alice and Bob can set
          up a secure channel or channels. This is performed via DTLS <xref target="RFC6347" format="default"/>
          and DTLS-SRTP <xref target="RFC5763" format="default"/> keying for SRTP
          <xref target="RFC3711" format="default"/> for the media channel and
          the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) over DTLS
          <xref target="RFC8261" format="default"/> for data
          channels. Specifically, Alice and Bob perform a DTLS handshake on
          every component which has been established by ICE. The total number of
          channels depends on the amount of muxing; in the most likely case, we
          are using both RTP/RTCP mux and muxing multiple media streams on the
          same channel, in which case there is only one DTLS handshake. Once the
          DTLS handshake has completed, the keys are exported <xref target="RFC5705" format="default"/> and used to key SRTP for the media channels.
        </t>
        <t>
          At this point, Alice and Bob know that they share a set of secure data
          and/or media channels with keys which are not known to any third-party
          attacker. If Alice and Bob authenticated via their IdPs, then they
          also know that the signaling service is not mounting a
          man-in-the-middle attack on their traffic. Even if they do not use an
          IdP, as long as they have minimal trust in the signaling service not
          to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, they know that their
          communications are secure against the signaling service as well (i.e.,
          that the signaling service cannot mount a passive attack on the
          communications).

          From a security perspective, everything from here on in is a little
          anticlimactic: Alice and Bob exchange data protected by the keys
          negotiated by DTLS. Because of the security guarantees discussed in
          the previous sections, they know that the communications are encrypted
          and authenticated.

        <t>
          The one remaining security property we need to establish is "consent
          freshness", i.e., allowing Alice to verify that Bob is still prepared
          to receive her communications so that Alice does not continue to send
          large traffic volumes to entities which went abruptly offline. ICE
          specifies periodic Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) keepalives but only if media is not flowing.
          Because the consent issue is more difficult here, we require WebRTC
          implementations to periodically send keepalives using the
          consent freshness
          mechanism specified in <xref target="RFC7675" format="default"/>.
  If a

        <name>Origin and Web Security Issues</name>
        <t>
          The basic unit of permissions for WebRTC is the origin <xref target="RFC6454" format="default"/>. Because the security of the origin depends on
          being able to authenticate content from that origin, the origin can
          only be securely established if data is transferred over HTTPS <xref target="RFC2818" format="default"/>. Thus, clients <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> treat HTTP and HTTPS origins as
          different permissions domains. Note: This follows directly from the
          origin security model and is stated here merely for clarity.
        </t>
        <t>
          Many Web browsers currently forbid by default any active mixed content
          on HTTPS pages. That is, when JavaScript is loaded from an HTTP origin
          onto an HTTPS page, an error is displayed and the HTTP content is not
          executed unless the user overrides the error. Any browser which
          enforces such a policy will also not permit access to WebRTC
          functionality from mixed content pages (because they never display
          mixed content).  Browsers which allow active mixed content <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
          nevertheless disable WebRTC functionality in mixed content settings.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that it is possible for a page which was not mixed content to
          become mixed content during the duration of the call.  The major risk
          here is that the newly arrived insecure JS might redirect media to a
          location controlled by the attacker.  Implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> either
          choose to terminate the call or display a warning at that point.
        </t>
        <t>
          Also note that the security architecture depends on the keying material
          not being available to move between origins.  However, it is assumed that
          the identity assertion can be passed to anyone that the page cares to.

          "Call customerservice@example.org".  The semantics of this request are
          that the media stream from the camera and microphone will only be
          routed through a connection which has been cryptographically verified
          (through the IdP mechanism or an X.509 certificate in the DTLS-SRTP
          handshake) as being associated with the stated identity. Note that it

          identity to the user when asking for permission.  The idea behind this
          type of permissions is that a user might have a fairly narrow list of
          peers they are willing to communicate with, e.g., "my mother" rather than
          "anyone on Facebook". Narrow permissions grants allow the browser to
          do that enforcement.

          A side effect of the default ICE behavior is that the peer learns
          one's IP address, which leaks large amounts of location
          information. This has negative privacy consequences in some
          circumstances. The API requirements in this section are intended to
          mitigate this issue. Note that these requirements are not intended to
          protect the user's IP address from a malicious site. In general, the
          site will learn at least a user's server-reflexive address from any
          HTTP transaction.  Rather, these requirements are intended to allow a
          site to cooperate with the user to hide the user's IP address from the
          other side of the call. Hiding the user's IP address from the server
          requires some sort of explicit privacy-preserving mechanism on the
          client (e.g., Tor Browser <eref brackets="angle" target="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en"/>) and

        NOTE: The mechanism described in this section was designed relatively
        early in the RTCWEB process. In retrospect, the WG was too optimistic
        about the enthusiasm for this kind of mechanism. At the time of publication,
        it has not been widely adopted or implemented. It appears in this document
        as a description of the state of the art as of this writing.

      <t>
          In a number of cases, it is desirable for the endpoint (i.e., the
          browser) to be able to directly identify the endpoint on the other
          side without trusting the signaling service to which they are
          connected. For instance, users may be making a call via a federated
          system where they wish to get direct authentication of the other
          side. Alternately, they may be making a call on a site which they
          minimally trust (such as a poker site) but to someone who has an
          identity on a site they do trust (such as a social network).
      </t>
      <t>
          Recently, a number of Web-based identity technologies (OAuth,
          Facebook Connect, etc.) have been developed. While the
          details vary, what these technologies share is that they have a
          Web-based (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS) IdP which attests to Alice's
          identity. For instance, if Alice has an account at example.org, Alice could
          use the example.org IdP to prove to others that Alice is
          alice@example.org.  The development of these technologies allows us to
          separate calling from identity provision: Alice could call you on a
          poker site but identify herself as alice@example.org.
      </t>
      <t>
          Whatever the underlying technology, the general principle is that the
          party which is being authenticated is NOT the signaling site but
          rather the user (and their browser). Similarly, the Relying Party is
          the browser and not the signaling site.  Thus, the browser <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
          generate the input to the IdP assertion process and
          display the results of the verification process to the user

          The mechanisms defined in this document do not require the browser to
          implement any particular identity protocol or to support any
          particular IdP. Instead, this document provides a generic interface
          which any IdP can implement. Thus, new IdPs and protocols can be
          introduced without change to either the browser or the calling
          service. This avoids the need to make a commitment to any particular
          identity protocol, although browsers may opt to directly implement
          some identity protocols in order to provide superior performance or UI
          properties.

        <t>
            Any federated identity protocol has three major participants:
        </t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>Authenticating Party (AP):</dt>
          <dd>
                The entity which is trying to establish its identity.
          </dd>
          <dt>Identity Provider (IdP):</dt>
          <dd>
                The entity which is vouching for the AP's identity.
          </dd>
          <dt>Relying Party (RP):</dt>
          <dd>
                The entity which is trying to verify the AP's identity.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
            The AP and the IdP have an account relationship of some kind: the AP
            registers with the IdP and is able to subsequently authenticate
            directly to the IdP (e.g., with a password). This means that the
            browser must somehow know which IdP(s) the user has an account
            relationship with.  This can either be something that the user
            configures into the browser or that is configured at the calling
            site and then provided to the PeerConnection by the Web application
            at the calling site. The use case for having this information
            configured into the browser is that the user may "log into" the
            browser to bind it to some identity. This is becoming common in new
            browsers. However, it should also be possible for the IdP
            information to simply be provided by the calling application.
        </t>
        <t>
            At a high level, there are two kinds of IdPs:
        </t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>Authoritative:</dt>
          <dd>
                IdPs which have verifiable control of some section of the
                identity space. For instance, in the realm of email, the
                operator of "example.com" has complete control of the namespace
                ending in "@example.com". Thus, "alice@example.com" is whoever
                the operator says it is. Examples of systems with authoritative
                IdPs include DNSSEC, an identity system for SIP
                (see <xref target="RFC8224"/>), and Facebook
                Connect (Facebook identities only make sense within the context
                of the Facebook system).
          </dd>
          <dt>Third-Party:</dt>
          <dd>
                IdPs which don't have control of their section of the identity
                space but instead verify users' identities via some unspecified
                mechanism and then attest to it. Because the IdP doesn't
                actually control the namespace, RPs need to trust that the IdP
                is correctly verifying AP identities, and there can potentially
                be multiple IdPs attesting to the same section of the identity
                space. Probably the best-known example of a third-party IdP
                is SSL/TLS certificates, where there are a large number of
                certificate authorities (CAs) all of whom can attest to any domain name.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
            If an AP is authenticating via an authoritative IdP, then the RP
            does not need to explicitly configure trust in the IdP at all.  The
            identity mechanism can directly verify that the IdP indeed made the
            relevant identity assertion (a function provided by the mechanisms
            in this document), and any assertion it makes about an identity for
            which it is authoritative is directly verifiable. Note that this
            does not mean that the IdP might not lie, but that is a
            trustworthiness judgement that the user can make at the time they
            look at the identity.
        </t>
        <t>
            By contrast, if an AP is authenticating via a third-party IdP, the
            RP needs to explicitly trust that IdP (hence the need for an
            explicit trust anchor list in PKI-based SSL/TLS clients). The list
            of trustable IdPs needs to be configured directly into the browser,
            either by the user or potentially by the browser manufacturer. This
            is a significant advantage of authoritative IdPs and implies that if
            third-party IdPs are to be supported, the potential number needs to
            be fairly small.
        </t>

        <t>
            In order to provide security without trusting the calling site, the
            PeerConnection component of the browser must interact directly with
            the IdP. The details of the mechanism are described in the W3C API
            specification, but the general idea is that the PeerConnection
            component downloads JS from a specific location on the IdP dictated
            by the IdP domain name. That JS (the "IdP proxy") runs in an
            isolated security context within the browser, and the PeerConnection
            talks to it via a secure message passing channel.
        </t>
        <t>
            Note that there are two logically separate functions here:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
                Identity assertion generation.
          </li>
          <li>
                Identity assertion verification.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
            The same IdP JS "endpoint" is used for both functions, but of course
            a given IdP might behave differently and load new JS to perform one
            function or the other.

        <t>
            When the PeerConnection object wants to interact with the IdP, the
            sequence of events is as follows:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>
                The browser (the PeerConnection component) instantiates an IdP
                proxy. This allows the IdP to load whatever JS is necessary into
                the proxy.  The resulting code runs in the IdP's security
                context.
          </li>
          <li>
                The IdP registers an object with the browser that conforms to
                the API defined in <xref target="webrtc-api" format="default"/>.
          </li>
          <li>
                The browser invokes methods on the object registered by the IdP
                proxy to create or verify identity assertions.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <t>
            This approach allows us to decouple the browser from any particular
            IdP; the browser need only know how to load the IdP's
            JavaScript -- the location of which is determined based on the IdP's
            identity -- and to call the generic API for requesting and verifying
            identity assertions. The IdP provides whatever logic is necessary to
            bridge the generic protocol to the IdP's specific
            requirements. Thus, a single browser can support any number of
            identity protocols, including being forward compatible with IdPs
            which did not exist at the time the browser was written.

        <name>Binding Identity Assertions to JSEP Offer/Answer Transactions</name>
        <t>
            An identity assertion binds the user's identity (as asserted by the
            IdP) to the SDP offer/answer exchange and specifically to the
            media. In order to achieve this, the PeerConnection must provide the
            DTLS-SRTP fingerprint to be bound to the identity. This is provided
            as a JavaScript object (also known as a dictionary or hash) with a
            single "fingerprint" key, as shown below:
        </t>
        <sourcecode name="json-1" type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "fingerprint":
    [
      { "algorithm": "sha-256",
        "digest": "4A:AD:B9:B1:3F:...:E5:7C:AB" },
      { "algorithm": "sha-1",
        "digest": "74:E9:76:C8:19:...:F4:45:6B" }
    ]
} ]]></sourcecode>
        <t>
            The "fingerprint" value is an array of
            objects.  Each object in the array contains "algorithm" and "digest" values, which correspond directly to
            the algorithm and digest values in the "fingerprint" attribute of the SDP <xref target="RFC8122" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
            This object is encoded in a <xref target="RFC8259" format="default">JSON</xref>
            string for passing to the IdP.  The identity assertion returned by
            the IdP, which is encoded in the "identity" attribute, is a JSON object that is
            encoded as described in <xref target="sec.carry-assertion" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
            This structure does not need to be interpreted by the IdP or the
            IdP proxy. It is consumed solely by the RP's browser.  The IdP
            merely treats it as an opaque value to be attested to.  Thus, new
            parameters can be added to the assertion without modifying the
            IdP.
        </t>
        <section anchor="sec.carry-assertion" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Carrying Identity Assertions</name>
          <t>
              Once an IdP has generated an assertion (see <xref target="sec.request-assert" format="default"/>), it is attached to the SDP
              offer/answer message. This is done by adding a new "identity"
              attribute to the SDP. The sole contents of this value is the
              identity assertion.  The identity assertion produced by the IdP is
              encoded into a UTF-8 JSON text, then <xref target="RFC4648" format="default">base64-encoded</xref> to produce this string.

                the "https:" scheme.  This changes the effective origin of the
                IdP, but not the domain of the identities that the IdP is
                permitted to assert and validate. I.e., the IdP is still

                  How an AP determines the appropriate IdP domain is out of
                  scope of this specification. In general, however, the AP has
                  some actual account relationship with the IdP, as this
                  identity is what the IdP is attesting to. Thus, the AP somehow
                  supplies the IdP information to the browser. Some potential
                  mechanisms include:
          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>

            <li>
                      Selected from some set of IdPs known to the calling site
                      (e.g., a button that shows "Authenticate via Facebook
                      Connect").

                  Unlike the AP, the RP need not have any particular
                  relationship with the IdP. Rather, it needs to be able to
                  process whatever assertion is provided by the AP.  As the
                  assertion contains the IdP's identity in the "idp" field of the JSON-encoded object (see
                  <xref target="sec.request-assert" format="default"/>), the URI can be
                  constructed directly from the assertion, and thus the RP can
                  directly verify the technical validity of the assertion with
                  no user interaction. Authoritative assertions need only be
                  verifiable. Third-party assertions also <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be verified
                  against local policy, as described in <xref target="sec.id-format" format="default"/>.

                The input to the identity assertion generation process is the JSON-encoded object

                set of certificate fingerprints the browser intends to use.

                IdP.
        </t>
        <t>
                The browser also identifies the origin that the PeerConnection
                is run in, which allows the IdP to make decisions based on who

        <t>
                An application can optionally provide a user identifier hint
                when specifying an IdP.  This value is a hint that the IdP can
                use to select amongst multiple identities, or to avoid providing
                assertions for unwanted identities.  The "username" is a string that has no meaning to
                any entity other than the IdP; it can contain any data the IdP
                needs in order to correctly generate an assertion.

                An identity assertion that is successfully provided by the IdP

        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">

                In order to generate an identity assertion, the IdP needs proof of
                the user's identity.  It is common practice to authenticate users
                (using passwords or multi-factor authentication), then use <xref target="RFC6265" format="default">cookies</xref> or <xref target="RFC7617" format="default">HTTP
                authentication</xref> for subsequent exchanges.
        </t>
        <t>
                The IdP proxy is able to access cookies, HTTP authentication data, or
                other persistent session data because it operates in the security
                context of the IdP origin.  Therefore, if a user is logged in, the
                IdP could have all the information needed to generate an
                assertion.
        </t>
        <t>
                An IdP proxy is unable to generate an assertion if the user is
                not logged in, or the IdP wants to interact with the user to
                acquire more information before generating the assertion.  If
                the IdP wants to interact with the user before generating an
                assertion, the IdP proxy can fail to generate an assertion and
                instead indicate a URL where login should proceed.

        <t>
                The application can then load the provided URL to enable the

                The IdP proxy verifies the assertion. Depending on the identity

                servers.  For instance, an OAuth-based protocol will likely
                require using the IdP as an oracle, whereas with a
                signature-based scheme it might be able to verify the assertion

            If HTTPS is not used to secure communications to the signaling
            server, and the identity mechanism used in
            <xref target="sec.generic.idp" format="default"/> is not used,
            then any on-path attacker can replace the DTLS-SRTP fingerprints
            in the handshake and thus substitute its own identity for that
            of either endpoint.
        </t>
        <t>
            Even if HTTPS is used, the signaling server can
            potentially mount a man-in-the-middle attack unless implementations
            have some mechanism for independently verifying keys. The UI
            requirements in <xref target="sec.proposal.comsec" format="default"/> are designed to
            provide such a mechanism for motivated/security conscious users, but
            are not suitable for general use.  The identity service mechanisms
            in <xref target="sec.generic.idp" format="default"/> are more suitable for general
            use. Note, however, that a malicious signaling service can strip off
            any such identity assertions, though it cannot forge new ones.  Note
            that all of the third-party security mechanisms available (whether
            X.509 certificates or a third-party IdP) rely on the security of the
            third party -- this is of course also true of the user's connection to the
            Web site itself. Users who wish to assure themselves of security
            against a malicious IdP can only do so by verifying
            peer credentials directly, e.g., by checking the peer's fingerprint
            against a value delivered out of band.
        </t>
        <t>
            In order to protect against malicious content JavaScript, that
            JavaScript <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be allowed to have direct
            access to -- or perform
            computations with -- DTLS keys. For instance, if content JS were able
            to compute digital signatures, then it would be possible for content
            JS to get an identity assertion for a browser's generated key and
            then use that assertion plus a signature by the key to authenticate
            a call protected under an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DH) key controlled by the content
            JS, thus violating the security guarantees otherwise provided by the
            IdP mechanism. Note that it is not sufficient merely to deny the
            content JS direct access to the keys, as some have suggested doing
            with the WebCrypto API <xref target="webcrypto" format="default"/>.  The JS must
            also not be allowed to perform operations that would be valid for a
            DTLS endpoint. By far the safest approach is simply to deny the
            ability to perform any operations that depend on secret information
            associated with the key. Operations that depend on public
            information, such as exporting the public key, are of course safe.

            However, these privacy protections come at a performance cost in

        <t>
            Note that the protections provided here assume a non-malicious

            status and (absent the use of a technology like Tor) their IP
            address, they can violate the user's privacy at will.  Users who wish
            privacy against the calling sites they are using must use separate
            privacy-enhancing technologies such as Tor. Combined WebRTC/Tor
            implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> arrange to route the media as well as the

        <t>
            Additionally, any identifier which persists across multiple calls is

            call. Otherwise, the other side will learn linkable information that
            would allow them to correlate the browser across multiple calls.
            Additionally, browsers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> implement the privacy-preserving CNAME

            to be more careful.
        </t>
        <t>
            Consider the case of a call center which accepts calls via
            WebRTC. An attacker proxies the call center's front-end and arranges
            for multiple clients to initiate calls to the call center. Note that
            this requires user consent in many cases, but because the data
            channel does not need consent, they can use that directly. Since ICE
            will complete, browsers can then be induced to send large amounts of
            data to the victim call center if it supports the data channel at
            all. Preventing this attack requires that automated WebRTC
            implementations implement sensible flow control and have the ability
            to triage out (i.e., stop responding to ICE probes on) calls which
            are behaving badly, and especially to be prepared to remotely
            throttle the data channel in the absence of plausible audio and
            video (which the attacker cannot control).
        </t>
        <t>
            Another related attack is for the signaling service to swap the ICE
            candidates for the audio and video streams, thus forcing a browser
            to send video to the sink that the other victim expects will contain
            audio (perhaps it is only expecting audio!), potentially causing
            overload.  Muxing multiple media flows over a single transport makes
            it harder to individually suppress a single flow by denying ICE
            keepalives. Either media-level (RTCP) mechanisms must be used or the
            implementation must deny responses entirely, thus terminating the
            call.
        </t>
        <t>
            Yet another attack, suggested by Magnus Westerlund, is for the
            attacker to cross-connect offers and answers as follows. It induces
            the victim to make a call and then uses its control of other users'
            browsers to get them to attempt a call to someone. It then
            translates their offers into apparent answers to the victim, which
            looks like large-scale parallel forking.  The victim still responds
            to ICE responses, and now the browsers all try to send media to the
            victim.  Implementations can defend themselves from this attack by
            only responding to ICE Binding Requests for a limited number of
            remote ufrags (this is the reason for the requirement that the JS
            not be able to control the ufrag and password).
            <xref target="RFC8834" sectionFormat="comma" section="13"/> documents a number
            of potential RTCP-based DoS attacks and countermeasures.
        </t>
        <t>
            Note that attacks based on confusing one end or the other about
            consent are possible even in the face of the third-party identity
            mechanism as long as major parts of the signaling messages are not
            signed. On the other hand, signing the entire message severely
            restricts the capabilities of the calling application, so there are
            difficult tradeoffs here.

        <name>IdP Authentication Mechanism</name>
        <t>
            This mechanism relies for its security on the IdP and on the
            PeerConnection correctly enforcing the security invariants described
            above. At a high level, the IdP is attesting that the user
            identified in the assertion wishes to be associated with the
            assertion. Thus, it must not be possible for arbitrary third parties
            to get assertions tied to a user or to produce assertions that RPs
            will accept.
        </t>
        <section anchor="sec.pc-origin" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>PeerConnection Origin Check</name>
          <t>
              Fundamentally, the IdP proxy is just a piece of HTML and JS loaded
              by the browser, so nothing stops a Web attacker from creating
              their own IFRAME, loading the IdP proxy HTML/JS, and requesting a
              signature over their own keys rather than those generated in
              the browser. However, that proxy would be in the
              attacker's origin, not the IdP's origin. Only the
              browser itself can instantiate a context that (a)&nbsp;is in the IdP's origin and
              (b)&nbsp;exposes the correct API surface. Thus, the IdP proxy on
              the sender's side <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure that it is running in the IdP's origin
              prior to issuing assertions.
          </t>
          <t>
              Note that this check only asserts that the browser (or some other
              entity with access to the user's authentication data) attests to
              the request and hence to the fingerprint.  It does not demonstrate
              that the browser has access to the associated private
              key, and therefore an attacker can attach their own identity
              to another party's keying material, thus making a call which
              comes from Alice appear to come from the attacker.
              See <xref target="RFC8844" format="default"/> for defenses against this
              form of attack.

          <t>
              As described in <xref target="sec.idp-uri" format="default"/>, the IdP proxy HTML/JS
              landing page is located at a well-known URI based on the IdP's
              domain name. This requirement prevents an attacker who can write
              some resources at the IdP (e.g., on one's Facebook wall) from
              being able to impersonate the IdP.

          <name>Privacy of IdP-Generated Identities and the Hosting Site</name>
          <t>
              Depending on the structure of the IdP's assertions, the calling
              site may learn the user's identity from the perspective of the
              IdP.  In many cases, this is not an issue because the user is
              authenticating to the site via the IdP in any case -- for instance,
              when the user has logged in with Facebook Connect and is then
              authenticating their call with a Facebook identity.  However, in
              other cases, the user may not have already revealed their identity
              to the site.  In general, IdPs <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> either verify that the user
              is willing to have their identity revealed to the site (e.g.,
              through the usual IdP permissions dialog) or arrange that the
              identity information is only available to known RPs (e.g., social
              graph adjacencies) but not to the calling site. The "domain" field
              of the assertion request can be used to check that the user has
              agreed to disclose their identity to the calling site; because it
              is supplied by the PeerConnection it can be trusted to be correct.

          <name>Security of Third-Party IdPs</name>
          <t>
              As discussed above, each third-party IdP represents a new
              universal trust point and therefore the number of these IdPs needs
              to be quite limited. Most IdPs, even those which issue unqualified
              identities such as Facebook, can be recast as authoritative IdPs
              (e.g., 123456@facebook.com). However, in such cases, the user
              interface implications are not entirely desirable.  One
              intermediate approach is to have special (potentially user
              configurable) UI for large authoritative IdPs, thus allowing the
              user to instantly grasp that the call is being authenticated by
              Facebook, Google, etc.

            <name>Confusable Characters</name>
            <t>
                Because a broad range of characters are permitted in identity
                strings, it may be possible for attackers to craft identities
                which are confusable with other identities (see
                <xref target="RFC6943" format="default"/> for more on this topic). This is
                a problem with any identifier space of this type
                (e.g., email addresses).
                Those minting identifiers should avoid mixed scripts and similar
                confusable characters. Those presenting these identifiers to a
                user should consider highlighting cases of mixed script usage
                (see <xref target="RFC5890" sectionFormat="comma" section="4.4"/>). Other best practices are still in development.

                When popup blocking is in use, the IdP proxy is unable to generate popup windows, dialogs, or
                any other form of user interactions.  This prevents the IdP
                proxy from being used to circumvent user interaction.  The
                "LOGINNEEDED" message allows the IdP proxy to inform the calling
                site of a need for user login, providing the information
                necessary to satisfy this requirement without resorting to
                direct user interaction from the IdP proxy itself.

                will be broken by third-party cookie blocking. One option is to
                accept this as a limitation; another is to have the
