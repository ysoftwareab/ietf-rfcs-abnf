      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
       In this document, "Captive Portal" is used to describe a network to
       which a device may be voluntarily attached, such that network access is
       limited until some requirements have been fulfilled.  Typically, a user
       is required to use a web browser to fulfill requirements imposed by the
       network operator, such as reading advertisements, accepting an
       acceptable-use policy, or providing some form of credentials.
      </t>
      <t>
       Implementations of captive portals generally require a web server, some
       method to allow/block traffic, and some method to alert the user.
       Common methods of alerting the user in implementations prior to this
       work involve modifying HTTP or DNS traffic.
      </t>
      <t>
       This document describes an architecture for implementing captive
       portals while addressing most of the problems arising for current
       captive portal mechanisms. The architecture is guided by these
       requirements:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Current captive portal solutions typically implement some variations
            of forging DNS or HTTP responses.
            Some attempt man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxy of HTTPS in
            order to forge responses.
            Captive portal solutions should not have to break any protocols or
            otherwise act in the manner of an attacker.
            Therefore, solutions <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> require the forging of responses from
            DNS or HTTP servers or from any other protocol.</li>
        <li>Solutions <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> permit clients to perform DNSSEC validation, which rules out solutions
            that forge DNS responses.
            Solutions <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> permit clients to detect and avoid TLS man-in-the-middle attacks
            without requiring a human to perform any kind of "exception" processing.</li>
        <li>To maximize universality and adoption, solutions <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> operate at the
            layer of Internet Protocol (IP) or above, not being specific to any
            particular access technology such as cable, Wi-Fi, or mobile
            telecom.</li>
        <li>Solutions <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> allow a device to query the
        network to determine whether the device is captive, without the
        solution being coupled to forging intercepted protocols or requiring
        the device to make sacrificial queries to "canary" URIs to check for
        response tampering (see <xref target="app-additional"/>). Current
        captive portal solutions that work by affecting DNS or HTTP generally
        only function as intended with browsers, breaking other applications
        using those protocols; applications using other protocols are not
        alerted that the network is a captive portal.</li>
        <li>The state of captivity <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be explicitly available to devices via
            a standard protocol, rather than having to infer the state indirectly.</li>
        <li>The architecture <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> provide a path of incremental migration,
            acknowledging the existence of a huge variety of pre-existing
            portals and end-user device implementations and software versions.
            This requirement is not to recommend or standardize existing
            approaches, but rather to provide device and portal implementors a path
            to a new standard.</li>
      </ul>

      <t>
       A side benefit of the architecture described in this document is that
       devices without user interfaces are able to identify parameters of
       captivity. However, this document does not describe a mechanism for
       such devices to negotiate for unrestricted network access. A future
       document could provide a solution to devices without user
       interfaces. This document focuses on devices with user interfaces.
      </t>
      <t>
       The architecture uses the following mechanisms:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Network provisioning protocols provide end-user devices with a
        Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) <xref target="RFC3986"/> for the API
        that end-user devices query for information about what is required to
        escape captivity. DHCP, DHCPv6, and Router Advertisement options for
        this purpose are available in <xref target="RFC8910"/>. Other
        protocols (such as RADIUS), Provisioning Domains <xref
        target="I-D.pfister-capport-pvd"/>, or static configuration may also
        be used to convey this Captive Portal API URI.  A device
        <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> query this API at any time to determine whether the
        network is holding the device in a captive state.
         </li>
        <li>A Captive Portal can signal User Equipment in response to
        transmissions by the User Equipment. This signal works in response to
        any Internet protocol and is not done by modifying protocols in band.
        This signal does not carry the Captive Portal API URI; rather, it
        provides a signal to the User Equipment that it is in a captive state.
        </li>
        <li>
            Receipt of a Captive Portal Signal provides a hint that User Equipment could be captive.
            In response, the device <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> query the provisioned API to obtain
            information about the network state.
            The device can take immediate action to satisfy the portal
            (according to its configuration/policy).
         </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
       The architecture attempts to provide confidentiality, authentication, and safety mechanisms
       to the extent possible.

<dt>Captive Portal Conditions
</dt>
<dd>Site-specific requirements that a user or device must satisfy in order to
gain access to the wider network.

<dd>The web server providing a user interface for assisting the user in
satisfying the conditions to escape captivity.
</dd>

<dt>Captive Portal API

<dt>Captive Portal Session
</dt>
<dd>Also referred to simply as the "Session", a Captive Portal Session is the
association for a particular User Equipment instance that starts when it interacts with
the Captive Portal and gains open access to the network and ends when the

maintains the state of each active Session and can limit Sessions based on a
length of time or a number of bytes used. The Session is associated with a
particular User Equipment instance using the User Equipment's identifier (see <xref
target="ue_identity"/>).

        <t>
       The User Equipment is the device that a user desires to be attached to
       a network with full access to all hosts on the network (e.g., to have
       Internet access). The User Equipment communication is typically
       restricted by the Enforcement Device, described in <xref target="section_capport_enforcement"/>,
       until site-specific requirements have been met.
        </t>
        <t>
        This document only considers devices with web browsers, with web
        applications being the means of satisfying Captive Portal Conditions.
        An example of such User Equipment is a smart phone.
        </t>
        <t>
        The User Equipment:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li><bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> support provisioning of the URI for the
          Captive Portal API (e.g., by DHCP).</li>
          <li><bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> distinguish Captive Portal API access per
          network interface, in the manner of Provisioning Domain Architecture
          <xref target="RFC7556"/>.</li>
          <li><bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> have a non-spoofable mechanism for
          notifying the user of the Captive Portal.</li>
          <li><bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> have a web browser so that the user may
          navigate to the User Portal.</li>
          <li><bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> support updates to the Captive Portal API
          URI from the Provisioning Service.</li>
          <li><bcp14>MAY</bcp14> prevent applications from using networks that
          do not grant full network access. For example, a device connected to a
          mobile network may be connecting to a captive Wi-Fi network; the
          operating system could avoid updating the default route to a device
          on the captive Wi-Fi network until network access restrictions have been
          lifted (excepting access to the User Portal) in the new
          network. This has been termed "make before break".</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
        None of the above requirements are mandatory because (a) we do not wish
        to say users or devices must seek full access to the Captive Portal,
        (b) the requirements may be fulfilled by manually visiting the captive
	portal web application, and (c) legacy devices must continue to be
        supported.
        </t>
        <t>
        If User Equipment supports the Captive Portal API, it
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> validate the API Server's TLS certificate (see
        <xref target="RFC2818"/>) according to the procedures in <xref
        target="RFC6125"/>.  The API Server's URI is obtained via a network
        provisioning protocol, which will typically provide a hostname to be
        used in TLS server certificate validation, against a DNS-ID in the
        server certificate.  If the API Server is identified by IP address,
        the iPAddress subjectAltName is used to validate the server
        certificate.  An Enforcement Device <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> allow access
        to any services that User Equipment could need to contact to perform
        certificate validation, such as Online Certificate Status Protocol
        (OCSP) responders, Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and NTP
        servers; see <xref target="RFC8908" sectionFormat="of" section="4.1"/>
        for more information.  If certificate validation fails, User Equipment
        <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> make any calls to the API Server.
        </t>
        <t>
        The User Equipment can store the last response it received from the
	Captive Portal API
        as a cached view of its state within the Captive Portal. This state can be used to
        determine whether its Captive Portal Session is near expiry. For example, the User
        Equipment might compare a timestamp indicating when the Session expires to the current
        time. Storing state in this way can reduce the need for communication with the
        Captive Portal API. However, it could lead to the state becoming
        stale if the User Equipment's view of the relevant conditions (byte quota, for example)
        is not consistent with the Captive Portal API's.

        <name>Provisioning Service</name>
        <t>
          The Provisioning Service is primarily responsible for providing a
          Captive Portal API URI to the User Equipment when it connects to the
          network, and later if the URI changes.  The Provisioning Service
          could also be the same service that is responsible for provisioning
          the User Equipment for access to the Captive Portal (e.g., by
          providing it with an IP address).  This section discusses two
          mechanisms that may be used to provide the Captive Portal API URI
          to the User Equipment.

           A standard for providing a Captive Portal API URI using DHCP or Router
           Advertisements is described in <xref target="RFC8910"/>.  The
           captive portal architecture expects this URI to indicate the API described

           <xref target="I-D.pfister-capport-pvd"/>
           proposes a mechanism for User Equipment to be provided with
           Provisioning Domain (PvD) Bootstrap Information containing the URI

        <name>Captive Portal API Server</name>
        <t>
         The purpose of a Captive Portal API is to permit a query of
         Captive Portal state without interrupting the user.  This API thereby
         removes the need for User Equipment to perform clear-text "canary"
         (see <xref target="app-additional"/>) queries to check for response
         tampering.
        </t>
        <t>
         The URI of this API will have been provisioned to the User Equipment.
         (Refer to <xref target="section_provisioning"/>.)
        </t>
        <t>
         This architecture expects the User Equipment to query the API when the
         User Equipment attaches to the network and multiple times thereafter.
         Therefore, the API <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support multiple repeated queries from the same
         User Equipment and return the state of captivity for the equipment.
        </t>
        <t>
         At minimum, the API <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> provide the state of captivity. Further, the
         API <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to provide a URI for the User Portal. The scheme for
         the URI <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be "https" so that the User Equipment communicates with
         the User Portal over TLS.
        </t>
        <t>
         If the API receives a request for state that does not correspond to the
         requesting User Equipment, the API <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> deny access.  Given that the
         API might use the User Equipment's identifier for authentication, this
         requirement motivates <xref target="id_recommended_hard"/>.
        </t>
         <t>
         A caller to the API needs to be presented with evidence that the
         content it is receiving is for a version of the API that it
         supports. For an HTTP-based interaction, such as in <xref
         target="RFC8908"/>, this might be achieved by using a content type
         that is unique to the protocol.
        </t>
        <t>
         When User Equipment receives Captive Portal Signals, the User Equipment
         <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> query the API to check its state of captivity.
         The User Equipment <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> rate-limit these API queries in the event of
         the signal being flooded. (See <xref target="Security"/>.)
        </t>
        <t>
         The API <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be extensible to support future use cases by allowing

        <t>
         The API <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use TLS to ensure server authentication.
         The implementation of the API <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure both confidentiality and

        For simplicity, and to reduce the attack surface, all signals <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be considered

      <t>
             Multiple components in the architecture interact with both the User
             Equipment and each other. Since the User Equipment is the focus of
             these interactions, the components must be able to both identify the
             User Equipment from their interactions with it and agree
             on the identity of the User Equipment when interacting with each
             other.
      </t>
      <t>
             The methods by which the components interact restrict the type of
             information that may be used as an identifying characteristic. This
             section discusses the identifying characteristics.

      <section anchor="id_identifiers">
        <name>Identifiers</name>
        <t>
                 An identifier is a characteristic of the User Equipment used by
                 the components of a Captive Portal to uniquely determine which
                 specific User Equipment instance is interacting with them.
                 An identifier can be a field contained in packets
                 sent by the User Equipment to the external network. Or, an
                 identifier can be an ephemeral property not contained in packets
                 destined for the external network, but instead correlated with
                 such information through knowledge available to the different
                 components.

        <name>Recommended Properties</name>
        <t>
             The set of possible identifiers is quite large. However, in order
             to be considered a good identifier, an identifier <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> meet the
             following criteria. Note that the optimal identifier will likely
             change depending on the position of the components in the network
             as well as the information available to them.

             An identifier <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>uniquely identify the User Equipment</li>

          <li>be visible to the Enforcement Device</li>
        </ul>
        <t>

             An identifier might only apply to the current point of network attachment. If the
             device moves to a different network location, its identity could change.

          <t>
                  The Captive Portal <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> associate the User
                  Equipment with an identifier that is unique among all of the
                  User Equipment interacting with the Captive Portal at that
                  time.
          </t>
          <t>
                  Over time, the User Equipment assigned to an identifier
                  value <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> change. Allowing the identified
                  device to change over time ensures that the space of
                  possible identifying values need not be overly large.
          </t>
          <t>
                  Independent Captive Portals <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use the same
                  identifying value to identify different User
                  Equipment instances. Allowing independent captive portals to reuse
                  identifying values allows the identifier to be a property of
                  the local network, expanding the space of possible
                  identifiers.

                  A good identifier does not lend itself to being easily
                  spoofed. At no time should it be simple or straightforward
                  for one User Equipment instance to pretend to be another User
                  Equipment instance, regardless of whether both are active at the same
                  time. This property is particularly important when the User
                  Equipment identifier is referenced externally by devices
                  such as billing systems or when the identity of the User
                  Equipment could imply liability.

                  of the User Equipment, such as answering a query about
                  whether the User Equipment is captive, the API Server needs

                 To evaluate whether a type of identifier is appropriate, one should consider
                 every recommended property from the perspective of interactions among
                 the components in the architecture. When comparing identifier types, choose
                 the one that best satisfies all of the recommended properties. The
                 architecture does not provide an exact measure of how well an identifier
                 type satisfies a given property; care should be taken in performing the
                 evaluation.

        <name>Example Identifier Types</name>
        <t>
                 This section provides some example identifier types, along with some
                 evaluation of whether they are suitable types. The list of identifier types
                 is not exhaustive; other types may be used. An important point to note
                 is that whether a given identifier type is suitable depends heavily on the
                 capabilities of the components and where in the network the components exist.
        </t>
        <section anchor="id_example_interface">
          <name>Physical Interface</name>
          <t>
                 The physical interface by which the User Equipment is attached to the
                 network can be used to identify the User Equipment. This identifier type has
                 the property of being extremely difficult to spoof: the User Equipment is
                 unaware of the property; one User Equipment instance cannot manipulate its
                 interactions to appear as though it is another.
          </t>


    <t>
                 Further, if only a single User Equipment instance is attached
                 to a given physical interface, then the identifier will be
                 unique. If multiple User Equipment instances are attached
                 to the network on the same physical interface, then this type
                 is not appropriate.
          </t>
          <t>
                 Another consideration related to uniqueness of the User
                 Equipment is that if the attached User Equipment changes,
                 both the API Server and the Enforcement Device
                 <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> invalidate their state related to the
                 User Equipment.
          </t>
          <t>
                 The Enforcement Device needs to be aware of the physical
                 interface, which constrains the environment; it must either
                 be part of the device providing physical access (e.g.,
                 implemented in firmware), or packets traversing the network
                 must be extended to include information about the source
                 physical interface (e.g., a tunnel).
          </t>
          <t>
                 The API Server faces a similar problem, implying that it should co-exist with the
                 Enforcement Device or that the Enforcement Device should extend requests to it
                 with the identifying information.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="id_example_IP_address">
          <name>IP Address</name>
          <t>
                  A natural identifier type to consider is the IP address of the User Equipment.
                  At any given time, no device on the network can have the same IP address
                  without causing the network to malfunction, so it is appropriate from the
                  perspective of uniqueness.
          </t>
          <t>
                  However, it may be possible to spoof the IP address, particularly for
                  malicious reasons where proper functioning of the network is not necessary
                  for the malicious actor. Consequently, any solution using the IP address
                  <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> proactively try to prevent spoofing of the IP address. Similarly,
                  if the mapping of IP address to User Equipment is changed, the components
                  of the architecture <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> remove or update their mapping to prevent spoofing.
                  Demonstrations of return routability, such as that required for TCP
                  connection establishment, might be sufficient defense against spoofing,
                  though this might not be sufficient in networks that use broadcast media
                  (such as some wireless networks).
          </t>
          <t>
                  Since the IP address may traverse multiple segments of the network, more
                  flexibility is afforded to the Enforcement Device and the API Server; they
                  simply must exist on a segment of the network where the IP address is still
                  unique. However, consider that a NAT may be deployed between the User Equipment
                  and the Enforcement Device. In such cases, it is possible for the components
                  to still uniquely identify the device if they are aware of the port mapping.
          </t>
          <t>
                In some situations, the User Equipment may have multiple IP
                addresses (either IPv4, IPv6, or a dual-stack <xref
                target="RFC4213"/> combination) while still satisfying all of
                the recommended properties. This raises some challenges to the
                components of the network. For example, if the User Equipment
                tries to access the network with multiple IP addresses, should
                the Enforcement Device and API Server treat each IP address as
                a unique User Equipment instance, or should it tie the multiple
                addresses together into one view of the subscriber?  An
                implementation <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> do either. Attention should
                be paid to IPv6 and the fact that it is expected for a device
                to have multiple IPv6 addresses on a single link. In such
                cases, identification could be performed by subnet, such as
                the /64 to which the IP belongs.

        <section anchor="id_example_mac_address">
          <name>Media Access Control (MAC) Address</name>
          <t>
            The MAC address of a device is often used as an identifier in existing implementations.
            This document does not discuss the use of MAC addresses within a captive portal system, but they can be used
            as an identifier type, subject to the criteria in <xref target="id_recommended_props"/>.

          <name>Context-Free URI</name>
          <t>
            A Captive Portal API needs to present information to clients
            that is unique to that client. To do this, some systems use
            information from the context of a request, such as the source
            address, to identify the User Equipment.
          </t>
          <t>
            Using information from context rather than information from the
            URI allows the same URI to be used for different clients. However,
            it also means that the resource is unable to provide relevant
            information if the User Equipment makes a request using a different network
            path. This might happen when User Equipment has multiple network interfaces.
            It might also happen if the address of the API provided by DNS
            depends on where the query originates (as in split DNS
            <xref target="RFC8499"/>).
          </t>
          <t>
            Accessing the API <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> depend on contextual information. However,
            the URIs provided in the API <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be unique to the User Equipment and not
            dependent on contextual information to function correctly.
          </t>
          <t>
            Though a URI might still correctly resolve when the User Equipment makes the
            request from a different network, it is possible that some
            functions could be limited to when the User Equipment makes requests using the
            Captive Portal. For example, payment options could be absent or a
            warning could be displayed to indicate the payment is not for the
            current connection.
          </t>
          <t>
            URIs could include some means of identifying the User Equipment in
            the URIs.  However, including unauthenticated User Equipment
            identifiers in the URI may expose the service to spoofing or replay
            attacks.

        <name>Trusting the Network</name>
        <t>
         When joining a network, some trust is placed in the network operator.
         This is usually considered to be a decision by a user on the basis of
         the reputation of an organization. However, once a user makes such a
         decision, protocols can support authenticating that a network is operated
         by who claims to be operating it.  The Provisioning Domain
         Architecture <xref target="RFC7556"/> provides some discussion on
         authenticating an operator.
        </t>
        <t>
         The user makes an informed choice to visit and trust the Captive
         Portal URI. Since the network provides the Captive Portal URI to the
         User Equipment, the network <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> do so securely so
         that the user's trust in the network can extend to their trust of the
         Captive Portal URI. For example, the DHCPv6 AUTH option can sign this
         information.
        </t>
        <t>
         If a user decides to incorrectly trust an attacking network, they might
         be convinced to visit an attacking web page and unwittingly provide
         credentials to an attacker. Browsers can authenticate servers but
         cannot detect cleverly misspelled domains, for example.
        </t>
        <t>
         Further, the possibility of an on-path attacker in an attacking network
         introduces some risks. The attacker could redirect traffic to arbitrary
         destinations. The attacker could analyze the user's
         traffic leading to loss of confidentiality, or the attacker could modify
         the traffic inline.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Authenticated APIs</name>
        <t>
         The solution described here requires that when the User Equipment needs to
         access the API Server, the User Equipment authenticates the
         server; see <xref target="section_client"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
         The Captive Portal API URI might change during the Captive Portal Session.
         The User Equipment can apply the same trust mechanisms to the new URI as it
         did to the URI it received initially from the Provisioning Service.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Secure APIs</name>
        <t>
           The solution described here requires that the API be secured using TLS.
           This is required to allow the User Equipment and API Server to exchange
           secrets that can be used to validate future interactions. The API <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
           ensure the integrity of this information, as well as its confidentiality.
        </t>
        <t>
           An attacker with access to this information might be able to
           masquerade as a specific User Equipment instance when interacting with the
           API, which could then allow them to masquerade as that User
           Equipment instance when interacting with the User Portal. This could give
           them the ability to determine whether the User Equipment has
           accessed the portal, deny the User Equipment service by ending
           their Session using mechanisms provided by the User Portal, or
           consume that User Equipment's quota. An attacker with the ability
           to modify the information could deny service to the User Equipment
           or cause them to appear as different User Equipment instances.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="section_signal_risks">
        <name>Risks Associated with the Signaling Protocol</name>
        <t>
         If a Signaling Protocol is implemented, it may be possible for any user on
         the Internet to send signals in an attempt to cause the receiving equipment to
         communicate with the Captive Portal API. This has been considered, and implementations may
         address it in the following ways:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The signal only signals to the User Equipment to query the API. It does not
              carry any information that may mislead or misdirect the User Equipment.</li>
          <li>Even when responding to the signal, the User Equipment securely authenticates
               with API Servers.</li>


          <li>The User Equipment limits the rate at which it accesses the API,
          reducing the impact of an attack attempting to generate excessive
          load on either the User Equipment or API.  Note that because there
          is only one type of signal and one type of API request in response
          to the signal, this rate-limiting will not cause loss of signaling
          information.
              </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>User Options</name>
        <t>
         The Captive Portal Signal could signal to the User Equipment that it is being held
         captive.  There is no requirement that the User Equipment do something
         about this.
         Devices <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> permit users to disable automatic reaction to
         Captive Portal Signal indications for privacy reasons.
         However, there would be the trade-off that the user doesn't get notified
         when network access is restricted.
         Hence, end-user devices <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> allow users to manually control captive
         portal interactions, possibly on the granularity of Provisioning
         Domains.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Privacy</name>
        <t>
          <xref target="ue_identity"/> describes a mechanism by which all components within
          the Captive Portal are designed to use the same identifier to uniquely identify
          the User Equipment.  This identifier could be abused to track the user.
          Implementers and designers of Captive Portals should take care to ensure that
          identifiers, if stored, are stored securely. Likewise, if any component
          communicates the identifier over the network, it should ensure the confidentiality
          of the identifier on the wire by using encryption such as TLS.
        </t>
        <t>
          There are benefits to choosing mutable anonymous identifiers. For
          example, User Equipment could cycle through multiple identifiers to
          help prevent long-term tracking. However, if the components of the
          network use an internal mapping to map the identity to a stable,
          long-term value in order to deal with changing identifiers, they
          need to treat that value as sensitive information; an attacker could
          use it to tie traffic back to the originating User Equipment, despite
          the User Equipment having changed identifiers.

      <name>Existing Captive Portal Detection Implementations</name>
      <t>
       Operating systems and user applications may perform various tests when
       network connectivity is established to determine if the device is
       attached to a network with a captive portal present. A common method is
       to attempt to make an HTTP request to a known, vendor-hosted endpoint with
       a fixed response. Any other response is interpreted as a signal that a
       captive portal is present. This check is typically not secured with TLS,
       as a network with a captive portal may intercept the connection, leading
       to a host name mismatch. This has been referred to as a "canary" request
       because, like the canary in the coal mine, it can be the first sign
       that something is wrong.
      </t>

      <t>
       Another test that can be performed is a DNS lookup to a known address
       with an expected answer. If the answer differs from the expected answer,
       the equipment detects that a captive portal is present.
       DNS queries over TCP or HTTPS are less likely to be modified than DNS
       queries over UDP due to the complexity of implementation.
      </t>

      <t>
       The different tests may produce different conclusions, varying by
       whether or not the implementation treats both TCP and UDP traffic
       and by which types of DNS are intercepted.
      </t>

      <t>
       Malicious or misconfigured networks with a captive portal present may
       not intercept these canary requests and choose to pass them through or decide to
       impersonate, leading to the device having a false negative.
