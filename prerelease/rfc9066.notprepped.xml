      <t>This document specifies the Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) signal channel Call Home, which
      enables a Call Home DOTS server to initiate a secure connection to a
      Call Home DOTS client and to receive attack traffic information from
      the Call Home DOTS client. The Call Home DOTS server in turn uses the
      attack traffic information to identify compromised devices launching
      outgoing DDoS attacks and take appropriate mitigation action(s).</t>
      <t>The DOTS signal channel Call Home is not specific to home networks;
      the solution targets any deployment in which it is required to block
      DDoS attack traffic closer to the source(s) of a DDoS attack.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) signal
      channel protocol <xref target="RFC9132" format="default"/> is
      used to carry information about a network resource or a network (or a
      part thereof) that is under a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
      attack <xref target="RFC4732" format="default"/>. Such information is sent by a
      DOTS client to one or multiple DOTS servers so that appropriate
      mitigation actions are undertaken on traffic deemed suspicious. Various
      use cases are discussed in <xref target="RFC8903" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>However, <xref target="RFC9132" format="default"/> only covers
      how to mitigate when being attacked (i.e., protecting a network from
      inbound DDoS attacks). It does not cover how to control the attacks
      close to their source(s) that are misusing network resources (i.e.,
      outbound DDoS attacks). In particular, the DOTS signal protocol does not
      discuss cooperative DDoS mitigation between the network hosting an
      attack source and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to suppress the
      outbound DDoS attack traffic originating from that network. As a
      reminder, the base basic DOTS architecture is depicted in <xref target="basea" format="default"/> (<xref target="RFC8811" sectionFormat="of" section="2"/>).</t>

      <t><xref target="home" format="default"/> details why the rise of Internet of
      Things (IoT) compounds the possibility of these being used as malicious
      actors that need to be controlled. Similar issues can be encountered in
      enterprise networks, data centers, etc. The ISP offering a DDoS
      mitigation service can detect outgoing DDoS attack traffic originating
      from its subscribers, or the ISP may receive filtering rules (e.g., using
      BGP Flowspec <xref target="RFC8955" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC8956" format="default"/>) from a transit provider to filter, block, or
      rate-limit DDoS attack traffic originating from the ISP's subscribers to
      a downstream target. Nevertheless, the DOTS signal channel does not
      provide means for the ISP to request blocking such attacks close to the
      sources without altering legitimate traffic. This document fills that
      void by specifying an extension to the DOTS signal channel: DOTS signal
      channel Call Home.</t>

        <t indent="3">Note: Another design approach would be to extend the DOTS signal
          channel with a new attribute to explicitly indicate whether a
          mitigation request concerns an outbound DDoS attack. In such an
          approach, it is assumed that a DOTS server is deployed within the
          domain that is hosting the attack source(s), while a DOTS client is
          enabled within an upstream network (e.g., access network). However,
          initiating a DOTS signal channel from an upstream network to a
          source network is complicated because of the presence of translators
          and firewalls. Moreover, the use of the same signal channel to
          handle both inbound and outbound attacks complicates both the
          heartbeat and redirection mechanisms that are executed as a function
          of the attack direction (see Sections <xref format="counter" target="hb"/> and <xref format="counter" target="redirect"/>). Also, the DOTS server will be subject to
          fingerprinting (e.g., using scanning tools) and DoS attacks (e.g.,
          by having the DOTS server perform computationally expensive
          operations). Various management and deployment considerations that
          motivate the Call Home functionality are listed in <xref target="RFC8071" sectionFormat="of" section="1.1"/>.</t>
      
      <t>"DOTS signal channel Call Home" (or "DOTS Call Home" for short) refers
      to a DOTS signal channel established at the initiative of a DOTS server
      thanks to a role reversal at the (D)TLS layer (<xref target="proc" format="default"/>). That is, the DOTS server initiates a secure
      connection to a DOTS client and uses that connection to receive the
      attack traffic information (e.g., attack sources) from the DOTS
      client.</t>
      <t>A high-level DOTS Call Home functional architecture is shown in <xref target="fa" format="default"/>. Attack source(s) are within the DOTS server
      domain.</t>

      <t>DOTS agents involved in the DOTS Call Home otherwise adhere to the
      DOTS roles as defined in <xref target="RFC8612" format="default"/>. For clarity,
      this document uses "Call Home DOTS client" (or "Call Home DOTS server")
      to refer to a DOTS client (or DOTS server) deployed in a Call Home
      scenario (<xref target="fa" format="default"/>). Call Home DOTS agents may (or may not)
      be co-located with DOTS agents that are compliant with <xref target="RFC9132" format="default"/> (see <xref target="coex" format="default"/> for more details).</t>
      <t>A Call Home DOTS client relies upon a variety of triggers to make use
      of the Call Home function (e.g., scrubbing the traffic from the attack
      source or receiving an alert from an attack target, a peer DDoS Mitigation
      System (DMS), or a transit provider). The definition of these triggers
      is deployment specific. It is therefore out of the scope of this
      document to elaborate on how these triggers are made available to a Call
      Home DOTS client.</t>
      <t>In a typical deployment scenario, the Call Home DOTS server is
      enabled on a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), which is aligned with
      recent trends to enrich the CPE with advanced security features. For
      example, the DOTS Call Home service can be part of services supported by
      an ISP-managed CPE or a managed security service subscribed to by the user.
      Unlike classic DOTS deployments <xref target="RFC8903" format="default"/>, a Call Home DOTS server
      maintains a single DOTS signal channel session for each DOTS-capable
      upstream provisioning domain <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-multihoming" format="default">
        </xref>.</t>
      <t>For instance, the Call Home DOTS server in the home network initiates
      the signal channel Call Home in "idle" time; subsequently, the
      Call Home DOTS client in the ISP environment can initiate a mitigation
      request whenever the ISP detects there is an attack from a compromised
      device in the DOTS server domain (i.e., from within the home
      network).</t>
      <t>The Call Home DOTS server uses the DDoS attack traffic information to
      identify the compromised device in its domain that is responsible for
      launching the DDoS attack, optionally notifies a network administrator,
      and takes appropriate mitigation action(s). For example, a mitigation
      action can be to quarantine the compromised device or block its traffic
      to the attack target(s) until the mitigation request is withdrawn.</t>
      <t>This document assumes that Call Home DOTS servers are provisioned
      with a way to know how to reach the upstream Call Home DOTS client(s),
      which could occur by a variety of means (e.g., <xref target="RFC8973" format="default"/>). The specification of such means are out of
      scope of this document.</t>
      <t>More information about the applicability scope of the DOTS signal
      channel Call Home is provided in <xref target="as" format="default"/>.</t>

      traffic closer to the source(s) of the attack. That is, attacks that are
      issued, e.g., from within an enterprise network or a data center will
      thus be blocked before exiting these networks.</t>

      <t>It is out of the scope of this document to identify an exhaustive
      list of such deployments.</t>
      <t>Call Home DOTS agent relationships are similar to those discussed in
      <xref target="RFC8811" sectionFormat="of" section="2.3"/>. For example, multiple
      Call Home DOTS servers of the same domain can be associated with the
      same Call Home DOTS client. A Call Home DOTS client may decide to
      contact these Call Home DOTS servers sequentially, fork a mitigation
      request to all of them, or select one Call Home DOTS server to place a
      mitigation request. Such a decision is implementation specific.</t>
      <t>For some mitigations, feedback may be required from an
      administrator to confirm a filtering action. The means to seek an
      administrator's consent are deployment specific. Indeed, a variety of
      implementation options can be considered for any given Call Home
      DOTS deployment, such as push notifications using a dedicated application,
      Syslog, etc. It is out of the scope of this document to make
      recommendations about how such interactions are implemented (see <xref target="fa" format="default"/>).</t>
      <t>The Call Home DOTS server can be enabled on a border router or a
      dedicated appliance. For the particular case of home networks, the Call
      Home DOTS server functionality can be enabled on a managed CPE or
      bundled with a CPE management application that is provided by an ISP to
      its subscribers. These managed services are likely to be designed to
      hide the complexity of managing (including configuring) the CPE. For
      example, managed CPEs support the means to notify the user when a new device
      is detected in order to seek confirmation as to whether or not access should be
      granted to the device. These means can be upgraded to interface
      with the Call Home DOTS server. Customized settings can be configured by
      users to control the notifications (e.g., triggers, type) and default
      actions.</t>

        <name>Procedure</name>

        <t>The DOTS signal channel Call Home preserves all but one of the DOTS
        client/server roles in the DOTS protocol stack, as compared to the client-initiated DOTS signal channel protocol <xref target="RFC9132" format="default"/>. The role reversal that
        occurs is at the (D)TLS layer; that is, (1) the Call Home DOTS server
        acts as a DTLS client, and the Call Home DOTS client acts as a DTLS
        server; or (2) the Call Home DOTS server acts as a TLS client
        initiating the underlying TCP connection, and the Call Home DOTS client
        acts as a TLS server. The Call Home DOTS server initiates a (D)TLS
        handshake to the Call Home DOTS client.</t>
        <t>For example, a home network element (e.g., home router) co-located
        with a Call Home DOTS server is the (D)TLS client. That is, the Call
        Home DOTS server assumes the role of the (D)TLS client, but the
        network element's role as a DOTS server remains the same.</t>
        <t>Existing certificate chains and mutual authentication mechanisms
        between the DOTS agents are unaffected by the Call Home function. From
        a deployment standpoint, and given the scale of Call Home DOTS servers
        that may be involved, enabling means for automating the provisioning
        of credentials on Call Home DOTS servers to authenticate to the Call
        Home DOTS client is encouraged. It is out of the scope of this
        document to elaborate on these means.</t>

        <t>The DOTS signal channel Call Home procedure is as follows:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
            <t>If UDP transport is used, the Call Home DOTS server begins by
            initiating a DTLS connection to the Call Home DOTS client.</t>
            <t>If TCP is used, the Call Home DOTS server begins
            by initiating a TCP connection to the Call Home DOTS client. Once
            connected, the Call Home DOTS server continues to initiate a TLS
            connection to the Call Home DOTS client.</t>
            <t>Peer DOTS agents may have mutual agreement to use
            a specific port number, such as by explicit configuration or
            dynamic discovery <xref target="RFC8973" format="default"/>. The interaction
            between the base DOTS signal channel and the Call Home is
            discussed in <xref target="app" format="default"/>.</t>
            <t>The Happy Eyeballs mechanism explained in <xref target="RFC9132" sectionFormat="of" section="4.3"/> is used
            for initiating (D)TLS connections.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Using this (D)TLS connection, the Call Home DOTS client may
            request, withdraw, or retrieve the status of mitigation requests.
            The Call Home DOTS client supplies the source information by means
            of new attributes defined in <xref target="mitigation" format="default"/>.

          <name>Heartbeat Mechanism</name>
          <t>Once the (D)TLS section is established between the DOTS agents,
          the Call Home DOTS client contacts the Call Home DOTS server to
          retrieve the session configuration parameters (<xref target="RFC9132" sectionFormat="of" section="4.5"/>). The Call Home DOTS
          server adjusts the "heartbeat-interval" to accommodate binding
          timers used by on-path NATs and firewalls. Heartbeats will then be exchanged by the DOTS agents following the instructions retrieved
          using the signal channel session configuration exchange.</t>

          <t>It is the responsibility of Call Home DOTS servers to ensure that
          on-path translators/firewalls are maintaining a binding so that the
          same external IP address and/or port number is retained for the DOTS
          signal channel session. A Call Home DOTS client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> trigger their
          heartbeat requests immediately after receiving heartbeat probes from
          its peer Call Home DOTS server.</t>
          <t>When an outgoing attack that saturates the outgoing link from the
          Call Home DOTS server is detected and reported by a Call Home DOTS
          client, the latter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> continue to use the DOTS signal channel even
          if no traffic is received from the Call Home DOTS server.</t>
          <t>If the Call Home DOTS server receives traffic from the Call Home
          DOTS client, the Call Home DOTS server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> continue to use the DOTS signal channel even if the threshold of allowed missing heartbeats ("missing-hb-allowed") is reached.</t>
          <t>If the Call Home DOTS server does not receive any traffic from
          the peer Call Home DOTS client during the time span required to
          exhaust the maximum "missing-hb-allowed" threshold, the Call Home
          DOTS server concludes the session is disconnected. Then, the Call
          Home DOTS server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> try to establish a new DOTS signal channel
          session, preferably by resuming the (D)TLS session.</t>

              represents a single ICMP type. Both ICMP <xref target="RFC0792" format="default"/> and ICMPv6 <xref target="RFC4443" format="default"/> types are supported. Whether ICMP or
              ICMPv6 types are to be used is determined by the address family
              of the "target-prefix". </t>
              <t>This is an
              optional attribute for the base DOTS signal channel
              operations.</t>
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <t>The "source-prefix" parameter is a mandatory attribute when the
          attack traffic information is signaled by a Call Home DOTS client
          (i.e., the Call Home scenario depicted in <xref target="signalch" format="default"/>). The "target-prefix" attribute <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
          included in the mitigation request signaling the attack information
          to a Call Home DOTS server. The "target-uri" or "target-fqdn"
          parameters can be included in a mitigation request for diagnostic
          purposes to notify the Call Home DOTS server domain administrator
          but <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be used to determine the target IP addresses.
          "alias-name" is unlikely to be conveyed in a Call Home mitigation
          request given that a target may be any IP resource and that there is
          no incentive for a Call Home DOTS server (embedded, for example, in
          a CPE) to maintain aliases.</t>
          <t>In order to help attack source identification by a Call Home DOTS
          server, the Call Home DOTS client <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> include in its mitigation
          request additional information such as "source-port-range" or
          "source-icmp-type-range" to disambiguate nodes sharing the same
        "source-prefix". IPv6 addresses/prefixes are sufficient to uniquely
          identify a network endpoint, without need for port numbers or ICMP
          type information. While this is also possible for IPv4, it is much
          less often the case than for IPv6. More address sharing implications
          on the setting of source information ("source-prefix",
          "source-port-range") are discussed in <xref target="nat" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>Only immediate mitigation requests (i.e., "trigger-mitigation"
          set to "true") are allowed; Call Home DOTS clients <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> send
          requests with "trigger-mitigation" set to "false". Such requests
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be discarded by the Call Home DOTS server with a 4.00 (Bad
          Request).</t>

          <t>The Call Home DOTS server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> check that the "source-prefix" is
          within the scope of the Call Home DOTS server domain. Note that in a
          DOTS Call Home scenario, the Call Home DOTS server considers, by
          default, that any routable IP prefix enclosed in "target-prefix" is
          within the scope of the Call Home DOTS client. Invalid mitigation
          requests are handled as per <xref target="RFC9132" sectionFormat="of" section="4.4.1"/>.</t>
          <t indent="3">
            Note: These validation checks do not apply when the source
              information is included as a hint in the context of the base
              DOTS signal channel.</t>
          
          <t>Call Home DOTS server domain administrator consent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be
          required to block the traffic from the compromised device to the
          attack target. An implementation <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> have a configuration knob to
          block the traffic from the compromised device to the attack target
          with or without DOTS server domain administrator consent.</t>
          <t>If consent from the Call Home DOTS server domain administrator
          is required, the Call Home DOTS server replies with 2.01 (Created)
          and the "status" code set to 1 (attack-mitigation-in-progress). Then,
          the mechanisms defined in <xref target="RFC9132" sectionFormat="of" section="4.4.2"/> are followed by the DOTS
          agents to update the mitigation status. In particular, if the attack
          traffic is blocked, the Call Home DOTS server informs the Call Home
          DOTS client that the attack is being mitigated (i.e., by setting the
          "status" code to 2 (attack-successfully-mitigated)).</t>
          <t>If the attack traffic information is identified by the Call Home
          DOTS server or the Call Home DOTS server domain administrator as
          legitimate traffic, the mitigation request is rejected with a 4.09
          (Conflict) (e.g., when no consent is required from an administrator)
          or a notification message with the "conflict-clause" (<xref target="RFC9132" sectionFormat="of" section="4.4.1"/>) set to the
          following new value:</t>
          <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
            <dt>4:</dt>
            <dd>Mitigation request rejected. This code is
              returned by the DOTS server to indicate the attack traffic has
              been classified as legitimate traffic.</dd>
          </dl>
          <t>Once the request is validated by the Call Home DOTS server,
          appropriate actions are enforced to block the attack traffic within
          the source network. For example, if the Call Home DOTS server is
          embedded in a CPE, it can program the packet processor to punt all

          the traffic from the compromised device to the target to slow path.
          The CPE inspects the punted slow path traffic to detect and block
          the outgoing DDoS attack traffic or quarantine the device (e.g.,
          using MAC-level filtering) until it is remediated and notifies the
          CPE administrator about the compromised device. Note that the Call
          Home DOTS client is informed about the progress of the attack
          mitigation following the rules in <xref target="RFC9132" sectionFormat="of" section="4.4.2"/>.</t>
          <t>The DOTS agents follow the same procedures specified in <xref target="RFC9132" format="default"/> for managing a mitigation
          request.</t>

          <t><xref target="ex1" format="default"/> depicts an example of a network
          provider that hosts a Call Home DOTS client and deploys a Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) between the DOTS client domain and DOTS server
          domain. In such cases, communicating an external IP address in a
          mitigation request by a Call Home DOTS client is likely to be
          discarded by the Call Home DOTS server because the external IP
          address is not visible locally to the Call Home DOTS server (<xref target="ex1" format="default"/>). The Call Home DOTS server is only aware of
          the internal IP addresses/prefixes bound to its domain (i.e., those
          used in the internal realm shown in <xref target="ex1" format="default"/>).
          Thus, Call Home DOTS clients that are aware of the presence of
          on-path CGNs <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include the external IP address and/or port
          number identifying the suspect attack source (i.e., those used in
          the external realm shown in <xref target="ex1" format="default"/>) but <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
          include the internal IP address and/or port number. To that aim, the
          Call Home DOTS client <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> rely on mechanisms, such as those described in <xref target="RFC8512" format="default"/> or <xref target="RFC8513" format="default"/>, to
          retrieve the internal IP address and port number that are mapped to
          an external IP address and port number. For the particular case of
          NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146" format="default"/>, if the target address is an
          IPv4 address, the IPv4-converted IPv6 address of this target address
          <xref target="RFC6052" format="default"/> <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      
      <t>This document deviates from classic DOTS signal channel usage by
      having the DOTS server initiate the (D)TLS connection. Security considerations related to the DOTS signal
      channel discussed in <xref target="RFC9132" sectionFormat="of" section="11"/> and (D)TLS early data
      discussed in <xref target="RFC9132" sectionFormat="of" section="7"/> <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be considered. DOTS
      agents <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> authenticate each other using (D)TLS before a DOTS signal
      channel session is considered valid.</t>
      <t>The Call Home function enables a Call Home DOTS server to be
      reachable by only the intended Call Home DOTS client. Appropriate
      filters (e.g., access control lists) can be installed on the Call Home
      DOTS server and network between the Call Home DOTS agents so that only
      communications from a trusted Call Home DOTS client to the Call Home
      DOTS server are allowed. These filters can be automatically installed by
      a Call Home DOTS server based on the configured or discovered peer Call
      Home DOTS client(s).</t>
      <t>An attacker may launch a DoS attack on the DOTS client by having it
      perform computationally expensive operations before deducing that the
      attacker doesn't possess a valid key. For instance, in TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/>, the ServerHello message contains a key share
      value based on an expensive asymmetric key operation for key
      establishment. Common precautions mitigating DoS attacks are
      recommended, such as temporarily adding the source
      address to a drop-list after a set number of unsuccessful authentication attempts.</t>
      <t>The DOTS signal Call Home channel can be misused by a misbehaving
      Call Home DOTS client by arbitrarily signaling legitimate traffic as
      being attack traffic or falsifying mitigation signals so that some
      sources are disconnected or some traffic is rate-limited. Such
      misbehaving Call Home DOTS clients may include sources identified by IP
      addresses that are used for internal use only (that is, these addresses
      are not visible outside a Call Home DOTS server domain). Absent explicit
      policy (e.g., the Call Home DOTS client and server are managed by the
      same administrative entity), such requests should be discarded by the
      Call Home DOTS server. More generally, Call Home DOTS servers should not
      blindly trust mitigation requests from Call Home DOTS clients. 

For
      example, Call Home DOTS servers could use the attack flow information
      contained in a mitigation request to enable a full-fledged packet
      inspection function to inspect all the traffic from the compromised
      device to the target. They could also redirect the traffic from the
      potentially compromised device to the target towards a DDoS mitigation
      system that can scrub the suspicious traffic without blindly blocking
      all traffic from the indicated attack source to the target. Call Home
      DOTS servers can also seek the consent of the DOTS server domain
      administrator to block the traffic from the potentially compromised
      device to the target (see <xref target="mitigation" format="default"/>). The means to
      seek consent are implementation specific.</t>
      <t>Call Home DOTS agents may interact with on-path address sharing
      functions to retrieve an internal IP address / external IP address
      mapping (<xref target="nat" format="default"/>) identifying an attack source.
      Blocking access or manipulating the mapping information will complicate
      DDoS attack mitigation close to an attack source. Additional security
      considerations are specific to the actual mechanism used to access that
      mapping (refer, e.g., to <xref target="RFC8512" sectionFormat="of" section="4"/> or
      <xref target="RFC8513" sectionFormat="of" section="4"/>).</t>
      <t> This document augments YANG data structures that are meant to be used as an abstract representation of DOTS signal channel Call Home messages. As such, the "ietf-dots-call-home" module does not introduce any new vulnerabilities beyond those specified above and in <xref target="RFC9132"/>.
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
      <t>The considerations discussed in <xref target="RFC6973" format="default"/> were
      taken into account to assess whether the DOTS Call Home introduces
      privacy threats.</t>
      <t>Concretely, the protocol does not leak any new information that can
      be used to ease surveillance. In particular, the Call Home DOTS server
      is not required to share information that is local to its network (e.g.,
      internal identifiers of an attack source) with the Call Home DOTS
      client. Also, the recommended data to be included in Call Home DOTS
      messages is a subset of the Layer 3 / Layer 4 information that can be
      learned from the overall traffic flows that exit the Call Home DOTS
      server domain. Furthermore, Call Home DOTS clients do not publicly
      reveal attack identification information; that information is encrypted
      and only shared with an authorized entity in the domain to which the IP
      address/prefix is assigned, from which an attack was issued.</t>
      <t>The DOTS Call Home does not preclude the validation of mitigation
      requests received from a Call Home DOTS client. For example, a security
      service running on the CPE may require an administrator's consent before
      the CPE acts upon the mitigation request indicated by the Call Home DOTS
      client. How the consent is obtained is out of scope of this
      document.</t>
      <t>Note that a Call Home DOTS server can seek an administrator's
      consent, validate the request by inspecting the relevant traffic for
      attack signatures, or proceed with both courses of action.</t>
      <t>The DOTS Call Home is only advisory in nature. Concretely, the DOTS
      Call Home does not impose any action to be enforced within the network
      hosting an attack source; it is up to the Call Home DOTS server (and/or
      network administrator) to decide whether and which actions are
      required.</t>
      <t>Moreover, the DOTS Call Home avoids misattribution by appropriately
      identifying the network to which a suspect attack source belongs
      (e.g., address sharing issues discussed in <xref target="mitigation" format="default"/>).</t>
      <t>Triggers to send a DOTS mitigation request to a Call Home DOTS server
      are deployment specific. For example, a Call Home DOTS client may rely
      on the output of some DDoS detection systems (flow exports or similar
      functions) deployed within the DOTS client domain to detect potential
      outbound DDoS attacks or may rely on abuse claims received from remote victim
      networks. These systems may be misused to track users and infer their
      activities. Such misuses are not required to achieve the functionality
      defined in this document (that is, protect the Internet and avoid
      altering the IP reputation of source networks). It is out of the scope
      to identify privacy threats specific to given attack detection
      technology. The reader may refer, for example, to <xref target="RFC7011" sectionFormat="of" section="11.8"/>.</t>

      <name>Some Home Network Issues</name>
      <t>Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more and more
      prevalent, in particular in home networks. With compute and memory
      becoming cheaper and cheaper, various types of IoT devices become
      available in the consumer market at affordable prices. But on the
      downside, there is a corresponding threat since most of these IoT
      devices are bought off-the-shelf and most manufacturers haven't
      considered security in the product design (e.g., <xref target="Sec-by-design" format="default"/>). IoT devices deployed in home networks
      can be easily compromised, they often do not have an easy mechanism to
      upgrade, and even when upgradable, IoT manufacturers may cease
      manufacture and/or discontinue patching vulnerabilities on IoT devices
      (Sections <xref target="RFC8576" sectionFormat="bare" section="5.4"/> and <xref target="RFC8576" sectionFormat="bare" section="5.5"/> of  <xref target="RFC8576"/>). These
      vulnerable and compromised devices will continue to be used for a long
      period of time in the home, and the end-user does not know that IoT
      devices in his/her home are compromised. The compromised IoT devices are
      typically used for launching DDoS attacks (<xref target="RFC8576" sectionFormat="of" section="3"/>) on victims while the owner/administrator of
      the home network is not aware about such misbehaviors. Similar to other
      DDoS attacks, the victim in this attack can be an application server, a
      host, a router, a firewall, or an entire network. Such misbehaviors can
      cause collateral damage that will affect end users, and can also harm
      the reputation of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) for being a source
      of attack traffic.</t>
      <t>Nowadays, network devices in a home network can offer network
      security functions (e.g., firewall <xref target="RFC4949" format="default"/> or
      Intrusion Protection System (IPS) service <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology" format="default"/> on a home router) to protect
      the devices connected to the home network from both external and
      internal attacks. It is natural to seek to provide DDoS defense in these
      devices as well, and over the years several techniques have been
      identified to detect DDoS attacks; some of these techniques can be
      enabled on home network devices but most of them are used within the
      ISP's network.</t>
      <t>Some of the DDoS attacks like spoofed RST or FIN packets, Slowloris
      <xref target="RS" format="default"/>, and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
      renegotiation are difficult to detect on a home network device without
      adversely affecting its performance. The reason is that typically home
      devices such as home routers have fast path to boost the throughput. For
      every new TCP/UDP flow, only the first few packets are punted through
      the slow path. Hence, it is not possible to detect various DDoS attacks
      in the slow path, since the attack payload is sent to the target server
      after the flow is switched to fast path. The reader may refer to <xref target="RFC6398" sectionFormat="of" section="2"/> for a brief definition of slow and
      fast paths.</t>
      <t>Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of all the packets of a flow would be
      able to detect some of the attacks. However, a full-fledged DPI to
      detect these type of DDoS attacks is functionally or operationally not
      possible for all the devices attached to the home network because of the
      memory and CPU limitations of the home routers. Furthermore, for certain
      DDoS attacks the logic needed to distinguish legitimate traffic from
      attack traffic on a per-packet basis is complex. This complexity is
      because that the packet itself may look "legitimate" and no attack
      signature can be identified. The anomaly can be identified only after
      detailed statistical analysis. In addition, network security services in
      home networks may not be able to detect all types of DDoS attacks using
      DPI. ISPs offering DDoS mitigation services have a DDoS detection
      capability that relies upon anomaly detection to identify zero day DDoS
      attacks and to detect DDoS attacks that cannot be detected using
      signatures and rate-limit techniques.</t>
      <t>ISPs can detect some DDoS attacks originating from a home network
      (e.g., <xref target="RFC8517" sectionFormat="of" section="2.6"/>), but the ISP
      usually does not have a mechanism to detect which device in the home
      network is generating the DDoS attack traffic. The primary reason for
      this is that devices in an IPv4 home network are typically behind a
      Network Address Translation (NAT) border <xref target="RFC2663" format="default"/>.
      Even in case of an IPv6 home network, although the ISP can identify the
      infected device in the home network launching the DDoS traffic by
      tracking its unique IPv6 address, the infected device can easily change
      its IPv6 address to evade remediation. A security function on the local
      home network is better positioned to track the compromised device across
      IPv6 address (and potentially even MAC address) changes and thus ensure
      that remediation remains in place across such events.</t>

      <name>Disambiguating Base DOTS Signal vs. DOTS Call Home</name>
      <t>With the DOTS signal channel Call Home, there is a chance that two
      DOTS agents can simultaneously establish two DOTS signal channels with
      different directions (base DOTS signal channel and DOTS signal channel
      Call Home). Here is one example drawn from the home network.
      Nevertheless, the outcome of the discussion is not specific to these
      networks, but applies to any DOTS Call Home scenario.</t>
      <t>In the Call Home scenario, the Call Home DOTS server in, for example,
      the home network can mitigate the DDoS attacks launched by the
      compromised device in its domain by receiving the mitigation request
      sent by the Call Home DOTS client in the ISP environment. In addition,
      the DOTS client in the home network can initiate a mitigation request to
      the DOTS server in the ISP environment to ask for help when the home
      network is under a DDoS attack. Such Call Home DOTS server and DOTS
      client in the home network can co-locate in the same home network
      element (e.g., the Customer Premises Equipment). In this case, with the
      same peer at the same time the home network element will have the base
      DOTS signal channel defined in <xref target="RFC9132" format="default"/> and the DOTS signal channel
      Call Home defined in this specification. Thus, these two signal channels
      need to be distinguished when they are both supported. Two approaches
      have been considered for distinguishing the two DOTS signal channels,
      but only the one that using the dedicated port number has been chosen as
      the best choice.</t>
      <t>By using a dedicated port number for each, these two signal channels
      can be separated unambiguously and easily. For example, the CPE uses the
      port number 4646 allocated in <xref target="RFC9132" format="default"/> to initiate the basic signal
      channel to the ISP when it acts as the DOTS client, and uses another
      port number to initiate the signal channel Call Home. Based on the
      different port numbers, the ISP can directly decide which kind of
      procedures should follow immediately after it receives the DOTS
      messages. This approach just requires two (D)TLS sessions to be
      established respectively for the basic signal channel and signal channel
      Call Home.</t>
      <t>The other approach is signaling the role of each DOTS agent (e.g., by
      using the DOTS data channel as depicted in <xref target="data" format="default"/>).
      For example, the DOTS agent in the home network first initiates a DOTS
      data channel to the peer DOTS agent in the ISP environment, at this time
      the DOTS agent in the home network is the DOTS client and the peer DOTS
      agent in the ISP environment is the DOTS server. After that, the DOTS
      agent in the home network retrieves the DOTS Call Home capability of the
      peer DOTS agent. If the peer supports the DOTS Call Home, the DOTS agent
      needs to subscribe to the peer to use this extension. Then, the reversal
      of DOTS role can be recognized as done by both DOTS agents. When the
      DOTS agent in the ISP environment, which now is the DOTS client, wants
      to filter the attackers' traffic, it requests the DOTS agent in the home
      network, which now is the DOTS server, for help.</t>
      <figure anchor="data">
        <name>Example of DOTS Data Channel Augmentation</name>
        <sourcecode name="" type="yangtree"><![CDATA[  
  augment /ietf-data:dots-data/ietf-data:capabilities:
      +--ro call-home-support?   boolean
    augment /ietf-data:dots-data/ietf-data:dots-client:
      +--rw call-home-enable?   boolean
]]></sourcecode>
      </figure>
      <t>Signaling the role will complicate the DOTS protocols, and this
      complexity is not required in context where the DOTS Call Home is not
      required or only when the DOTS Call Home is needed. Besides, the DOTS
      data channel may not work during attack time. Even if changing the above
      example from using the DOTS data channel to the DOTS signal channel, the
      more procedures will still reduce the efficiency. Using the dedicated
      port number is much easier and more concise compared to the second
      approach, and its cost that establishing two (D)TLS sessions is much
      less. So, using a dedicated port number for the DOTS Call Home is
      recommended in this specification. The dedicated port number can be
      configured locally or discovered using means such as <xref target="RFC8973" format="default"/>.</t>
