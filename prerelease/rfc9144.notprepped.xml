      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
            The revised NMDA <xref target="RFC8342" format="default"/> introduces a set of new datastores that each hold YANG-defined data <xref target="RFC7950" format="default"/> and represent a different "viewpoint" on the data that is maintained by a server. New YANG datastores that are introduced include &lt;intended&gt;, which contains validated configuration data that a client application intends to be in effect, and &lt;operational&gt;, which contains operational state data (such as statistics) as well as configuration data that is actually in effect.    
      </t>
      <t>
            NMDA introduces, in effect, a concept of "lifecycle" for management data, distinguishing between data that is part of a configuration that was supplied by a user, configuration data that has actually been successfully applied and that is part of the operational state, and the overall operational state that includes applied configuration data as well as status and statistics. 
      </t>
      <t>
            As a result, data from the same management model can be reflected in multiple datastores.  Clients need to specify the target datastore to be specific about 
            which viewpoint of the data they want to access.  For example, a client application can differentiate whether they are interested in the configuration that is supplied to a server and is supposed to be in effect or the configuration that has been applied and is actually in effect on the server.   
      </t>
      <t>Due to the fact that data can propagate from one datastore to another, it is possible for differences between datastores to occur.  Some of this is entirely expected, as there may be a time lag between when a configuration is given to the device and reflected in &lt;intended&gt; until when it actually takes effect and is reflected in &lt;operational&gt;.  However, there may be cases when a configuration item that was to be applied may not actually take effect at all or needs an unusually long time to do so.  This can be the case due to certain conditions not being met, certain parts of the configuration not propagating because they are considered inactive, resource dependencies not being resolved, or even implementation errors in corner conditions.  
      </t>
      <t>When the configuration that is in effect is different from the configuration that was applied, many issues can result.  It becomes more difficult to operate the network properly due to limited visibility of the actual operational status, which makes it more difficult to analyze and understand what is going on in the network.  Services may be negatively affected (for example, degrading or breaking a customer service), and network resources may be misallocated.  
      </t>
      <t>
            Applications can potentially analyze any differences between two datastores by retrieving the contents from both datastores and comparing them.  However, in many cases, this will be both costly and extremely wasteful. 
      </t>
      <t>
   This document introduces a YANG data model that defines RPCs
   intended to be used in conjunction with NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241" format="default"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040" format="default"/>. These RPCs allow a client to request a server to compare two NMDA datastores and report any differences.

      <name>Data Model Overview</name>
      <t>
    The core of the solution is a new management operation, &lt;compare&gt;, that compares the data tree contents of two datastores.  The operation checks whether there are any differences in values or in data nodes that are contained in either datastore and returns any differences as output.  The output is returned in the format specified in YANG Patch <xref target="RFC8072" format="default"/>.  
      </t>
      <t> 
    The YANG data model defines the &lt;compare&gt; operation as a new RPC.  The operation takes the following input parameters:
      </t>
      <dl spacing="normal">
        <dt>source:</dt><dd> The source identifies the datastore to serve as the reference for the comparison -- for example, &lt;intended&gt;.</dd>
        <dt>target:</dt><dd> The target identifies the datastore to compare against the source -- for example, &lt;operational&gt;.</dd>
        <dt>filter-spec:</dt><dd> This is a choice between different filter constructs to identify the parts of the datastore to be retrieved.  It acts as a node selector that specifies which data nodes are within the scope of the comparison and which nodes are outside the scope.  This allows a comparison operation to be applied only to a specific part of the datastore that is of interest, such as a particular subtree.  Note that the filter does not allow expressions that match against data node values, since this may incur implementation difficulties and is not required for normal use cases. </dd>
        <dt>all:</dt><dd> When set, this parameter indicates that all differences should be included, including differences pertaining to schema nodes that exist in only one of the datastores.  When this parameter is not included, a prefiltering step is automatically applied to exclude data from the comparison that does not pertain to both datastores: if the same schema node is not present in both datastores, then all instances of that schema node and all its descendants are excluded from the comparison. This allows client applications to focus on the differences that constitute true mismatches of instance data without needing to specify more complex filter constructs.</dd>
        <dt>report-origin:</dt><dd> When set, this parameter indicates that origin metadata should be included as part of RPC output. 
        When this parameter is omitted, origin metadata in comparisons that involve 
        &lt;operational&gt; is by default omitted.
        Note that origin metadata only applies to &lt;operational&gt;; it is therefore also omitted in comparisons that do not involve &lt;operational&gt; regardless of whether or not the parameter is set.  
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <t>
    The operation provides the following output parameter:
      </t>
      <dl spacing="normal">
        <dt>differences:</dt><dd> This parameter contains the list of differences.  Those differences are encoded per the YANG Patch data model defined in <xref target="RFC8072"/>.  When a datastore node in the source of the comparison is not present in the target of the comparison, this can be indicated either as a "delete" or as a "remove" in the patch as there is no differentiation between those operations for the purposes of the comparison.
The YANG Patch data model is augmented to indicate the value of source datastore nodes in addition to the patch itself that would need to be applied to the source to produce the target.   When the target datastore is &lt;operational&gt; and the input parameter "report-origin" is set, origin metadata is included as part of the patch. Including origin metadata can help explain the cause of a difference in some cases -- for example, when a data node is part of &lt;intended&gt; but the origin of the same data node in &lt;operational&gt; is reported as "system".</dd>
      </dl>
      <t>The data model is defined in the ietf-nmda-compare YANG
        module. Its structure is shown in the following figure. The notation syntax 
        follows <xref target="RFC8340" format="default"/>.</t>

      <name>Performance Considerations</name>
      <t>
The &lt;compare&gt; operation can be computationally expensive.  While responsible client applications are expected to use the operation responsibly and sparingly only when warranted, implementations need to be aware of the fact that excessive invocation of this operation will burden system resources and need to ensure that system performance will not be adversely impacted.  One possibility for an implementation to mitigate against this is to limit the number of requests that are served to a client, or to any number of clients, in any one time interval, by rejecting requests made at a higher frequency than the implementation can reasonably sustain.</t>
      <t>
While useful, tools such as YANG data models that allow for the	monitoring of server resources, system performance, 
and statistics about RPCs and RPC rates are outside the scope of this document. 
When defined, any such model should be general in nature and not limited to the RPC operation defined in this document.

      <t>
   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241" format="default"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040" format="default"/>.  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242" format="default"/>.  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/>.
</t>
      <t>
   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC8341" format="default"/> provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content. 
      </t>
      <t>NACM specifies access for the server in its entirety, and the same access rules apply to all datastores. 
Any subtrees to which a requestor does not have read access are silently 
skipped and not included in the comparison.</t>
<t>
   The RPC operation defined in this YANG module, &lt;compare&gt;, may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to this operation.  This is the sensitivity/vulnerability of RPC operation &lt;compare&gt;:
      </t>
      <t>
  Comparing datastores for differences requires a certain amount of processing resources at the server.  An attacker could attempt to attack a server by making a high volume of comparison requests. Server implementations can guard against such scenarios in several ways.  For one, they can implement the NACM in order to require proper authorization for requests to be made.  Second, server implementations can limit the number of requests that they serve to a client in any one time interval, rejecting requests made at a higher frequency than the implementation can reasonably sustain.

      <name>Possible Future Extensions</name>
      <t>It is conceivable to extend the &lt;compare&gt; operation with a number of possible additional features in the future.  </t>

      <t>
    Specifically, it is possible to define an extension with an optional feature for dampening. This will allow clients to specify a minimum time period for which a difference must persist for it to be reported.  This will enable clients to distinguish between differences that are only fleeting from ones that are not and that may represent a real operational issue and inconsistency within the device.  
      </t>
      <t>For this purpose, an additional input parameter can be added to specify the dampening period.  Only differences that pertain 
           for at least the dampening time are reported.   
           A value of 0 or omission of the parameter indicates no 
           dampening. 
           Reporting of differences <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> correspondingly be delayed by the dampening period from the time the request is received.
      </t>
      <t> 
    To implement this feature, a server implementation might run a comparison when the RPC is first invoked and temporarily store the result.  Subsequently, it could wait until after the end of the dampening period to check whether the same differences are still observed.  The differences that still persist are then returned.
