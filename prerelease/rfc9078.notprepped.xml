      <name>Introduction</name>

      <t>The popularity of social media has led to user comfort with easily signaling summary reactions
                to an author's posting, by using emoji graphics, such as with a 'thumbs up', 'heart', or
                'smiley' indication. Sometimes the permitted repertoire is constrained to a small set, and
                sometimes a more extensive range of indicators is supported. </t>
      <t>This specification extends this existing practice in social media and instant messaging into
                Internet Mail.</t>
      <t>While it is already possible to include symbols and graphics as part of an email reply's
                content, there has not been an established means of signaling the semantic substance that
                such data are to be taken as a summary 'reaction' to the original message -- that is, a
                mechanism to identify symbols as specifically providing a summary reaction to the cited
                message rather than merely being part of the free text in the body of a response. Such a
                structured use of the symbol(s) allows recipient Mail User Agents (MUAs) to correlate this reaction to the
                original message and possibly to display the information distinctively.</t>
      <t>This facility defines a new MIME Content-Disposition, to be used in conjunction with the
                In-Reply-To header field, to specify that a part of a message containing one or more emojis
                can be treated as a summary reaction to a previous message.</t>

      <name>Reaction Content-Disposition</name>
      <t>A message sent as a reply <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include a part containing: </t>

      <artwork><![CDATA[Content-Disposition: reaction
]]></artwork>

      <t>If such a field is specified, the Content-Type of the part <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be:</t>

      <artwork><![CDATA[Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

          <t>The content of this part is restricted to a single line of emoji. The
            <xref target="RFC5234"/> is: </t>

          <sourcecode name="" type="abnf"><![CDATA[part-content    = emoji *(WSP emoji) CRLF
                                
emoji           = emoji-sequence
emoji-sequence  = { defined in [Emoji-Seq] }

base-emojis     = thumbs-up / thumbs-down / grinning-face / 
                  frowning-face / crying-face 
                  ; Basic set of emojis, drawn from [Emoji-Seq]

; grinning-face   = {U+1F600}
; frowning-face   = {U+2639}
; crying-face     = {U+1F622}
]]></sourcecode>
      <t>The part-content is either the message's single MIME body or the content portion of the first MIME multipart body part.</t>
      <t>The ABNF rule emoji-sequence is inherited from <xref target="Emoji-Seq"/>. It defines a set of
                Unicode code point sequences, which must then be encoded as UTF-8. Each sequence forms a
                single pictograph. The BNF syntax used in <xref target="Emoji-Seq"/> differs from <xref target="RFC5234"/> and
                <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be interpreted as used in Unicode documentation. The referenced document describes these
                as sequences of code points.</t>

        <aside><t>Note: The part-content can first be parsed into candidate reactions,
                        separated by WSP. Each candidate reaction that does not constitute a single
                        emoji-sequence (as per <xref target="Emoji-Seq"/>) is invalid. Invalid candidates can
                        be treated individually, rather than affecting the remainder of the part-content's
                        processing. The remaining candidates form the set of reactions to be processed. This
                        approach assumes use of a mechanism for emoji sequence validation that is not
                        specified here.</t></aside>

      <t>The rule base-emojis is provided as a simple, common list, or 'vocabulary' of emojis. It was
                developed from some existing practice in social networking and is intended for similar use.
                However, support for it as a base vocabulary is not required. Having providers and consumers
                employ a common set will facilitate user interoperability, but different sets of users might
                want to have different, common (shared) sets.</t>
            <t>The reaction emoji or emojis are linked to the current message's In-Reply-To field, which references
                an earlier message and provides a summary reaction to that earlier message <xref target="RFC5322"/>. For processing details, see <xref target="processing"/>.</t>
      <t>Reference to unallocated code points <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be treated as an error; the corresponding UTF-8-encoded code points <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be processed using the system default method for denoting an
                unallocated or undisplayable code point. </t>
        <aside><t>Note: The "emoji" token looks simple. It isn't. Implementers are
                        well advised not to assume that emoji sequences are trivial to parse or validate.
                        Among other concerns, an implementation of the Unicode Character Database is required.
                        An emoji is more than a stand-in for a simple alternation of characters. Similarly,
                        one emoji sequence is not interchangeable with, or equivalent to, another one, and
                        comparisons require detailed understanding of the relevant Unicode mechanisms. Use of
                        an existing Unicode implementation will typically prove extremely helpful, as will an
                        understanding of the error modes that may arise with a chosen implementation.</t></aside>

    <section anchor="processing">
      <name>Reaction Message Processing</name>
      <t>The presentation aspects of reaction processing are necessarily MUA specific and beyond the
                scope of this specification. In terms of the message itself, a recipient MUA that supports
                this mechanism operates as follows: </t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>If a received message R's header contains an In-Reply-To field, check to see if it
                        references a previous message that the MUA has sent or received. </li>
        <li>If R's In-Reply-To: does reference one, then check R's message content for a part with
                        a "reaction" Content-Disposition header field, at either the outermost level or as
                        part of a multipart at the outermost level.</li>
        <li>If such a part is found and the content of the part conforms to the restrictions
                        outlined above, remove the part from the message and process the part as a reaction. </li>
      </ol>
        <aside><t>Note: A message's content might include other, nested messages. These can
                        be analyzed for reactions, independently of the containing message, applying the above
                        algorithm for each contained message, separately.</t></aside>
      <t>Again, the handling of a message that has been successfully processed is MUA specific and
                beyond the scope of this specification.</t>

      <name>Usability Considerations</name>
      <t>This specification defines a mechanism for the structuring and carriage of information. It does
                not define any user-level details of use. However, the design of the user-level mechanisms
                associated with this facility is paramount. This section discusses some issues to
                consider.</t>
      <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
        <dt>Creation:  </dt>
        <dd>Because an email environment is different from a typical social
                        media platform, there are significant -- and potentially challenging -- choices in the
                        design of the user interface, to support indication of a reaction. Is the reaction to
                        be sent only to the original author, or should it be sent to all recipients? Should
                        the reaction always be sent in a discrete message containing only the reaction, or
                        should the user also be able to include other message content? (Note that carriage of
                        the reaction in a normal email message enables inclusion of this other content.)</dd>
        <dt>Display:  </dt>
        <dd>Reaction indications might be more useful when displayed in close
                        visual proximity to the original message, rather than merely as part of an email
                        response thread. 
                        The handling of
                        multiple reactions, from the same person, is also an opportunity
                        for making a user experience design choice that could be interesting.</dd>
        <dt>Culture:  </dt>
        <dd>The use of an image, intended to serve as a semantic signal, is
                        determined and affected by cultural factors, which differ in complexity and nuance. It
                        is important to remain aware that an author's intent when sending a particular emoji
                        might not match how the recipient interprets it. Even simple, commonly used emojis can
                        be subject to these cultural differences.</dd>

      <section>
        <name>Example Message</name>
        <t>A simple message exchange might be:</t>

        <t>Repeating the caution that actual use of this capability requires careful usability design
                    and testing, this section describes simple examples -- which have not been tested -- of
                    how the reaction response might be displayed in a summary list of messages:</t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>Summary:</dt>
          <dd>Summary listings of messages in a folder include columns such

          <dt>Message:</dt>
          <dd>A complete message is often displayed with a tailored section
                            for header fields, enhancing the format and showing only selected header fields. A
                            pseudo-field might be added for reactions, again showing the symbol and a
                            count.</dd>

    <section>
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>This specification employs message content that is a strict subset of existing possible
                content and thus introduces no new content-specific security considerations. The fact that
                this content is structured might seem to make it a new threat surface, but there is no
                analysis demonstrating that it does.</t>
      <t>This specification defines a distinct Content-Disposition value for specialized message
                content. Processing that handles the content differently from other content in the message
                body might introduce vulnerabilities. Since this capability is likely to produce new user
                interaction features, that might also produce new social engineering vulnerabilities.</t>
    </section>
    <section>
      <name>IANA Considerations</name>
      <t>IANA has registered the Reaction MIME Content-Disposition parameter, per <xref target="RFC2183"/>.</t>
      <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">

      <name>Experimental Goals</name>
      <t>The basic, email-specific mechanics for this capability are well established and
                well understood. Points of concern, therefore, are: </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Technical issues in using emojis within a message body</li>
        <li>Market interest</li>
        <li>Usability</li>

      <t> So the questions to answer for this Experimental specification are:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Is there demonstrated interest by MUA developers?</li>
        <li>If MUA developers add this capability, is it used by authors?</li>
        <li>Does the presence of the Reaction capability create any operational problems for
                        recipients?</li>
        <li>Does the presence of the Reaction capability demonstrate additional security
                        issues?</li>
        <li>What specific changes to the specification are needed?</li>
        <li>What other comments will aid in use of this mechanism?</li>

      <name>Acknowledgements</name>
      <t>This specification had substantive commentary on three IETF mailing lists.</t>
      <t>This work began as a private exercise, in July 2020, with private discussion, for draft-crocker-reply-emoji. It morphed into draft-crocker-inreply-react, with significant discussion on the ietf-822 mailing list <eref target="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-822" brackets="angle"/>, September through November 2020. The discussion
                produced a fundamental change from proposing a new header field to instead defining a new
                Content-Disposition type, as well as significantly enhancing its text concerning Unicode. It
                also produced two additional coauthors.</t>
      <t>In November 2020, the Dispatch mailing list <eref target="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/dispatch" brackets="angle"/> was queried about the draft, but it produced no discussion,
                though it did garner one statement of interest.</t>
      <t>A 4-week Last Call was issued on this document, January 2021, resulting in quite a bit of fresh
                discussion on the last-call mailing list <eref target="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/last-call" brackets="angle"/> and producing further changes to this document. After
                Last Call completed, additional concerns regarding the Unicode-related details surfaced, producing yet more changes to the document. It also produced a challenge that prompted the
                current version of this Acknowledgements section.</t>
      <t>Readers who are interested in the details of the document's history are encouraged to peruse the
                archives for the three lists, searching Subject fields for "react".</t>
