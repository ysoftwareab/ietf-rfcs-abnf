      <t>
      This document describes the function and responsibilities
      of the RFC Independent Submission Editor (ISE).
      The Independent Submission stream is one of the stream producers
      that create draft RFCs,
      with the ISE as its stream approver.
      The ISE is overall responsible for activities within
      the Independent Submission stream, working with draft editors and 
      reviewers, and interacts with the RFC Production Center
      and Publisher, and the RFC Series Editor (RSE).
      The ISE is appointed by the IAB, and also interacts
      with the
      IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (LLC).</t>
      <t>This version obsoletes RFC 6548 to replace all references to the
      Internet Administrative Support Activity (IASA) and related structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0
      structure.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
      The RFC Editor Model
      <xref target="RFC8728" format="default"/>
      defines a set of streams that produce draft RFCs, which are
      submitted for publication. This document defines the management
      function for the Independent Submission stream, specifically the
     role of Independent Submission Editor (ISE).</t>
      <t>
      The previous version of this
      document <xref target="RFC6548" format="default"/> is a derivative of 
      <xref target="RFC5620" section="3.2" sectionFormat="comma" format="default"/>, 
      and was separated out from <xref target="RFC6635" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>
      This document updates the Independent Submission Editor Model to 
      align it with the IASA 2.0 structure <xref target="RFC8711" format="default"/>
      that creates the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company
      ("LLC") managed by a board of directors ("LLC Board").  
      This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC6548" format="default"/>.

      <name>Independent Submission Editor</name>
      <t>
      The ISE is 
      an individual who is responsible for the
      Independent Submission stream of RFCs, as defined by 
      <xref target="RFC8729" format="default"/>.
      The Independent Submission stream and the
      ISE are not under the authority or
      direction of the RSE or the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC)
      (see <xref target="RFC8728" format="default"/>).
      As noted below, the ISE is appointed by and is responsible
      directly to the IAB.

        <name>Qualifications</name>
        <t>
        The ISE is a senior position for
        which the following qualifications are desired:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>Technical competence, i.e., broad technical experience
	    and perspective across a wide range of Internet
	    technologies and applications, and also the
	    ability to work effectively with portions of that spectrum
	    in which they have no personal expertise.</li>
          <li>Thorough familiarity with the RFC series.</li>
          <li>An ability to define and constitute advisory and
	    document review arrangements.  If those arrangements
	    include an Editorial Board similar to the current one or
	    some equivalent arrangement, the ability to assess the
            technical competence of potential Editorial Board members
            (see <xref target="editorial_board" format="default"/>).</li>
          <li>Good standing in the technical community, in and beyond
	    the IETF.</li>
          <li> Demonstrated editorial skills, good command of the
	    English language, and demonstrated history of being able
	    to work effectively with technical documents and materials
	    created by others.</li>
          <li>The ability to work effectively in a multi-actor
	    environment with divided authority and responsibility
	    similar to that described in
            <xref target="RFC6635" format="default"/>.
	  </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section anchor="Resp" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Responsibilities</name>
        <t> 
        The ISE is an individual who may
        have assistants and who is responsible for:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>Maintaining technical quality of the Independent Submission
            stream.</li>
          <li>Reviewing, approving, and processing Independent Submissions.</li>
          <li>Forwarding draft RFCs in the Independent Submission stream
            to the RFC Production Center.</li>
          <li>Defining and developing the scope of the Independent Submission
            stream as a part of the overall RFC Editor function
            <xref target="RFC6635" format="default"/>.</li>
          <li>Reviewing and approving RFC errata for Independent Submissions.</li>
          <li>Coordinating work and conforming to general RFC Series
	    policies as specified by the IAB and RSE.</li>
          <li> Providing statistics and documentation as requested by the
            RSE and/or LLC.</li>
        </ol>
        <t>
        The ISE may choose to select individuals to participate in
         an Advisory Board for assistance in special topics as the
         ISE deems appropriate.  Such an Advisory Board exists
         at the pleasure of the ISE, and its members serve at the
         pleasure of the ISE. 
        </t>
        <t>
  	The individual with the listed qualifications is
	selected by the IAB after input has been collected from the
	community.
        </t>
        <t>
        While the ISE itself is considered a volunteer function, the
	IAB considers maintaining the Independent Submission stream
	part of the IAB's supported activities.  Therefore, the LLC
	should include these costs in the IASA budget.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="editorial_board" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Independent Submission Editorial Board</name>
      <t>
      The ISE is supported by an Editorial
      Board for the review of Independent Submission stream documents.
      This board is known as the Independent Submission Editorial
      Board. This volunteer Editorial Board exists at the pleasure of
      the ISE, and its members 
      serve at the pleasure of the ISE. The existence of this board is
      simply noted within this model, and additional discussion of
      such is considered out of scope of this document.
