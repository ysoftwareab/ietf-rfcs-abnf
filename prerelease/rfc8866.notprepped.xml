    <abstract>
      <t>This memo defines the Session Description Protocol (SDP). SDP is
      intended for describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of session
      announcement, session invitation, and other forms of multimedia session
      initiation. This document obsoletes RFC 4566.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>When initiating multimedia teleconferences, voice-over-IP calls,
      streaming video, or other sessions, there is a requirement to convey
      media details, transport addresses, and other session description
      metadata to the participants.</t>
      <t>SDP provides a standard representation for such information,
      irrespective of how that information is transported. SDP is purely a
      format for session description -- it does not incorporate a transport
      protocol, and it is intended to use different transport protocols as
      appropriate, including the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) <xref target="RFC2974" format="default"/>, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261" format="default"/>, Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) <xref target="RFC7826" format="default"/>, electronic mail <xref target="RFC5322" format="default"/> using the MIME extensions <xref target="RFC2045" format="default"/>,
      and the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) <xref target="RFC7230" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>SDP is intended to be general purpose so that it can be used in a
      wide range of network environments and applications. However, it is not
      intended to support negotiation of session content or media encodings:
      this is viewed as outside the scope of session description.</t>
      <t>This memo obsoletes <xref target="RFC4566" format="default"/>. The changes relative to
      <xref target="RFC4566" format="default"/> are outlined in <xref target="changes" format="default"/> of this memo.</t>

        <name>Session Initiation</name>
        <t>The <xref target="RFC3261" format="default">Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)</xref>
        is an application-layer control protocol for creating, modifying, and
        terminating sessions such as Internet multimedia conferences, Internet
        telephone calls, and multimedia distribution. The SIP messages used to
        create sessions carry session descriptions that allow participants to
        agree on a set of compatible media types <xref target="RFC6838" format="default"/>. 
        These session descriptions
        are commonly formatted using SDP. When used with SIP, the <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"> offer/answer model</xref> provides a limited
        framework for negotiation using SDP.</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Streaming Media</name>
        <t>The <xref target="RFC7826" format="default">Real-Time Streaming Protocol
        (RTSP)</xref>, is an application-level protocol for control over the
        delivery of data with real-time properties. RTSP provides an
        extensible framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery of
        real-time data, such as audio and video. An RTSP client and server
        negotiate an appropriate set of parameters for media delivery,
        partially using SDP syntax to describe those parameters.</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Email and the World Wide Web</name>
        <t>Alternative means of conveying session descriptions include
        electronic mail and the World Wide Web (WWW). For both email and WWW
        distribution, the media type "application/sdp" is used. This enables
        the automatic launching of applications for participation in the
        session from the WWW client or mail reader in a standard manner.</t>
        <t>Note that descriptions of multicast sessions sent only via email
        or the WWW do not have the property that the receiver of a session
        description can necessarily receive the session because the multicast
        sessions may be restricted in scope, and access to the WWW server or
        reception of email is possibly outside this scope.</t>

        <name>Multicast Session Announcement</name>
        <t>In order to assist the advertisement of multicast multimedia
        conferences and other multicast sessions, and to communicate the
        relevant session setup information to prospective participants, a
        distributed session directory may be used. An instance of such a
        session directory periodically sends packets containing a description
        of the session to a well-known multicast group. These advertisements
        are received by other session directories such that potential remote
        participants can use the session description to start the tools
        required to participate in the session.</t>
        <t>One protocol used to implement such a distributed directory is the
        <xref target="RFC2974" format="default">SAP</xref>. SDP provides the recommended
        session description format for such session announcements.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Requirements and Recommendations</name>
      <t>The purpose of SDP is to convey information about media streams in
      multimedia sessions to allow the recipients of a session description to
      participate in the session. SDP is primarily intended for use with
      Internet protocols, although it is sufficiently general that it can describe
      multimedia conferences in other network environments. Media streams can
      be many-to-many. Sessions need not be continually active.</t>
      <t>Thus far, multicast-based sessions on the Internet have differed from
      many other forms of conferencing in that anyone receiving the traffic
      can join the session (unless the session traffic is encrypted). In such
      an environment, SDP serves two primary purposes. It is a means to
      communicate the existence of a session, and it is a means to convey
      sufficient information to enable joining and participating in the
      session. In a unicast environment, only the latter purpose is likely to
      be relevant.</t>
      <t>An SDP description includes the following:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Session name and purpose</li>
        <li>Time(s) the session is active</li>
        <li>The media comprising the session</li>
        <li>Information needed to receive those media (addresses, ports,
          formats, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <t>As resources necessary to participate in a session may be limited,
      some additional information may also be desirable:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Information about the bandwidth to be used by the session</li>
        <li>Contact information for the person responsible for the
          session</li>
      </ul>
      <t>In general, SDP must convey sufficient information to enable
      applications to join a session (with the possible exception of
      encryption keys) and to announce the resources to be used to any
      nonparticipants that may need to know. (This latter feature is
      primarily useful when SDP is used with a multicast session announcement
      protocol.)</t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Media and Transport Information</name>
        <t>An SDP description includes the following media information:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The type of media (video, audio, etc.)</li>
          <li>The media transport protocol (RTP/UDP/IP, H.320, etc.)</li>
          <li>The format of the media (H.261 video, MPEG video, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <t>In addition to media format and transport protocol, SDP conveys
        address and port details. For an IP multicast session, these
        comprise:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The multicast group address for media</li>
          <li>The transport port for media</li>
        </ul>
        <t>This address and port are the destination address and destination
        port of the multicast stream, whether being sent, received, or
        both.</t>
        <t>For unicast IP sessions, the following are conveyed:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The remote address for media</li>
          <li>The remote transport port for media</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The semantics of the address and port depend on context. 
        Typically, this <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be the remote address and remote port 
        to which media is to be sent or received. 
        Details may differ based on the network type, address type, 
        protocol, and media specified, and whether the SDP is being distributed 
        as an advertisement or negotiated in an offer/answer <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/> exchange.
        (E.g., Some address types or protocols may not have a notion of port.) 
        Deviating from typical behavior should be done cautiously 
        since this complicates implementations (including middleboxes that must 
        parse the addresses to open Network Address Translation (NAT) or 
        firewall pinholes).</t>

      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Timing Information</name>
        <t>Sessions may be either bounded or unbounded in time. Whether or not
        they are bounded, they may be only active at specific times. SDP can
        convey:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>An arbitrary list of start and stop times bounding the
            session</li>
          <li>For each bound, repeat times such as "every Wednesday at 10am
            for one hour"</li>
        </ul>
        <t>This timing information is globally consistent, irrespective of
        local time zone or daylight saving time (see <xref target="timing" format="default"/>).</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Obtaining Further Information about a Session</name>
        <t>A session description could convey enough information to decide
        whether or not to participate in a session. SDP may include additional
        pointers in the form of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) <xref target="RFC3986" format="default"/> 
        for more information about the session.
        (Note that use of URIs to indicate remote resources is subject to 
        the security considerations from <xref target="RFC3986" format="default"/>.)

      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Internationalization</name>
        <t>The SDP specification recommends the use of the ISO 10646 character
        set in the UTF-8 encoding <xref target="RFC3629" format="default"/> to allow many
        different languages to be represented. However, to assist in compact
        representations, SDP also allows other character sets such as
        <xref target="ISO.8859-1.1998" format="default"/> to be used when desired. 
        Internationalization only applies to
        free-text subfields (session name and background information), and not to
        SDP as a whole.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="SDP-specification" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>SDP Specification</name>
      <t>An SDP description is denoted by the media type "application/sdp"
      (See <xref target="iana" format="default"/>).</t>
      <t>An SDP description is entirely textual. SDP field names and attribute
      names use only the US-ASCII subset of UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629" format="default"/>, 
      but textual fields and
      attribute values <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use the full ISO 10646 character set in UTF-8
      encoding, or some other character set defined by the "a=charset:"
      attribute (<xref target="charset" format="default"/>). 
      Field and attribute values that use the full UTF-8 character
      set are never directly compared, hence there is no requirement for UTF-8
      normalization. The textual form, as opposed to a binary encoding such as
      ASN.1 or XDR, was chosen to enhance portability, to enable a variety of
      transports to be used, and to allow flexible, text-based toolkits to be
      used to generate and process session descriptions. However, since SDP
      may be used in environments where the maximum permissible size of a
      session description is limited, the encoding is deliberately compact.
      Also, since descriptions may be transported via very unreliable means
      or damaged by an intermediate caching server, the encoding was designed
      with strict order and formatting rules so that most errors would result
      in malformed session descriptions that could be detected easily and
      discarded.</t>
      <t>An SDP description consists of a number of lines of text of the
      form:</t>
      <sourcecode name="" type=""><![CDATA[
   <type>=<value>
]]></sourcecode>
      <t>where &lt;type&gt; is exactly one case-significant character and
      &lt;value&gt; is structured text whose format depends on &lt;type&gt;.
      In general, &lt;value&gt; is either a number of subfields delimited by a
      single space character or a free format string, and is case-significant
      unless a specific field defines otherwise. Whitespace separators are not used
      on either side of the "=" sign, however, the value can contain a leading
      whitespace as part of its syntax, i.e., that whitespace is part of the value.</t>
      <t>An SDP description <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> conform to the syntax defined in <xref target="abnf" format="default"/>.
      The following is an overview of the syntax.</t>
      <t>An SDP description consists of a session-level section followed by
      zero or more media descriptions. The session-level section starts with a
      "v=" line and continues to the first media description (or the end of
      the whole description, whichever comes first). Each media description
      starts with an "m=" line and continues to the next media description
      or the end of the whole session description, whichever comes first. In
      general, session-level values are the default for all media unless
      overridden by an equivalent media-level value.</t>
      <t>Some lines in each description are required and some are optional,
      but when present, they must appear in exactly the order given here. (The fixed order
      greatly enhances error detection and allows for a simple parser).
      In the following overview, optional items are marked with a "*".</t>
      <sourcecode type=""><![CDATA[
   Session description
      v=  (protocol version)
      o=  (originator and session identifier)
      s=  (session name)
      i=* (session information)
      u=* (URI of description)
      e=* (email address)
      p=* (phone number)
      c=* (connection information -- not required if included in
           all media descriptions)
      b=* (zero or more bandwidth information lines)
      One or more time descriptions: 
        ("t=", "r=" and "z=" lines; see below)
      k=* (obsolete)
      a=* (zero or more session attribute lines)
      Zero or more media descriptions

   Time description
      t=  (time the session is active)
      r=* (zero or more repeat times)
      z=* (optional time zone offset line)

   Media description, if present
      m=  (media name and transport address)
      i=* (media title)
      c=* (connection information -- optional if included at
           session level)
      b=* (zero or more bandwidth information lines)
      k=* (obsolete)
      a=* (zero or more media attribute lines)
]]></sourcecode>
      <t>The set of type letters is deliberately small and not intended to be
      extensible -- an SDP parser <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> completely ignore or reject any session
      description that contains a type letter that it does not understand. The
      attribute mechanism ("a=", described in <xref target="attribspec" format="default"/>) is the primary means for
      extending SDP and tailoring it to particular applications or media. Some
      attributes (the ones listed in <xref target="attrs" format="default"/>) have
      a defined meaning, but others may be added on a media-
      or session-specific basis. (Attribute scopes in addition to media-specific
      and session-specific scopes may also be defined in extensions to this document,
      e.g., <xref target="RFC5576" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8864" format="default"/>.)
      An SDP parser <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore any attribute it doesn't understand.</t>
      <t>An SDP description may contain URIs that reference external content
      in the "u=", "k=", and "a=" lines. These URIs may be dereferenced in
      some cases, making the session description non-self-contained.</t>
      <t>The connection ("c=") information in the session-level section
      applies to all the media descriptions of that session unless overridden by connection
      information in the media description. 
      For instance, in the example below, each audio media description behaves as if 
      it were given a "c=IN IP4 198.51.100.1".
</t>
      <t>An example SDP description is:</t>
      <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
      v=0

]]></sourcecode>
      <t>Text-containing fields such as the session-name-field and information-field are octet
      strings that may contain any octet with the exceptions of 0x00 (Nul),
      0x0a (ASCII newline), and 0x0d (ASCII carriage return). The sequence
      CRLF (0x0d0a) is used to end a line, although parsers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be
      tolerant and also accept lines terminated with a single newline
      character. If the "a=charset:" attribute is not present, these octet
      strings <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be interpreted as containing ISO-10646 characters in UTF-8
      encoding. When the "a=charset:" attribute is present the session-name-field,
      information-field, and some attribute fields are interpreted according
      to the selected character set.</t>

          <li>If the session is multicast, the connection address will be an

            the connection address contains the unicast IP address of the
            expected data source, data relay, or data sink as determined by
            additional attribute-fields (<xref target="attribspec" format="default"/>). 
            It is not expected that unicast
            addresses will be given in a session description that is
            communicated by a multicast announcement, though this is not
            prohibited.</li>

            have a time to live (TTL) value present in addition to the
            multicast address. The TTL and the address together define the
            scope with which multicast packets sent in this session will be
            sent. TTL values <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be in the range 0-255. Although the TTL <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
            be specified, its use to scope multicast traffic is deprecated;
            applications <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use an administratively scoped address
            instead.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The TTL for the session is appended to the address using a slash as
        a separator. An example is:</t>
        <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
   c=IN IP4 233.252.0.1/127
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>"IP6" multicast does not use TTL scoping, and hence the TTL value
        <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be present for "IP6" multicast. It is expected that IPv6 scoped
        addresses will be used to limit the scope of multimedia
        conferences.</t>
        <t>Hierarchical or layered encoding schemes are data streams where the
        encoding from a single media source is split into a number of layers.
        The receiver can choose the desired quality (and hence bandwidth) by
        only subscribing to a subset of these layers. Such layered encodings
        are normally transmitted in multiple multicast groups to allow
        multicast pruning. This technique keeps unwanted traffic from sites
        only requiring certain levels of the hierarchy. For applications
        requiring multiple multicast groups, we allow the following notation
        to be used for the connection address:</t>
        <sourcecode name="" type=""><![CDATA[
   <base multicast address>[/<ttl>]/<number of addresses>
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>If the number of addresses is not given, it is assumed to be one.
        Multicast addresses so assigned are contiguously allocated above the
        base address, so that, for example:</t>
        <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
   c=IN IP4 233.252.0.1/127/3
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>would state that addresses 233.252.0.1, 233.252.0.2, and
        233.252.0.3 are to be used with a TTL of 127. This is semantically
        identical to including multiple "c=" lines in a media description:</t>
        <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
   c=IN IP4 233.252.0.1/127
   c=IN IP4 233.252.0.2/127
   c=IN IP4 233.252.0.3/127
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>Similarly, an IPv6 example would be:</t>
        <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
   c=IN IP6 ff00::db8:0:101/3
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>which is semantically equivalent to:</t>

   c=IN IP6 ff00::db8:0:102
   c=IN IP6 ff00::db8:0:103
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>(remember that the TTL subfield is not present in "IP6"
        multicast).</t>

        representation of time values in seconds
        since January 1, 1900 UTC. To convert these values to Unix
        time (UTC), subtract decimal 2208988800.</t>
        <t>Some time representations will
        wrap in the year 2036. Because SDP uses an arbitrary length
        decimal representation, it does not have this issue. Implementations
        of SDP need to be prepared to handle these larger values.</t>
        <t>If the &lt;stop-time&gt; is set to zero, then the session is not
        bounded, though it will not become active until after the
        &lt;start-time&gt;. If the &lt;start-time&gt; is also zero, the
        session is regarded as permanent.</t>
        <t>User interfaces <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> strongly discourage the creation of
        unbounded and permanent sessions as they give no information about
        when the session is actually going to terminate, and so make
        scheduling difficult.</t>
        <t>The general assumption may be made, when displaying unbounded
        sessions that have not timed out to the user, that an unbounded
        session will only be active until half an hour from the current time
        or the session start time, whichever is the later. If behavior other
        than this is required, a &lt;stop-time&gt; <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be given and modified as
        appropriate when new information becomes available about when the
        session should really end.</t>
        <t>Permanent sessions may be shown to the user as never being active
        unless there are associated repeat times that state precisely when the
        session will be active.</t>

        <t>An"r=" line (repeat-field) specifies repeat times for a session. 
        If needed to express complex schedules, multiple repeat-fields may
        be included. For example, if a
        session is active at 10am on Monday and 11am on Tuesday for one hour
        each week for three months, then the &lt;start-time&gt; in the
        corresponding "t=" line would be the representation of 10am on the
        first Monday, the &lt;repeat interval&gt; would be 1 week, the
        &lt;active duration&gt; would be 1 hour, and the offsets would be zero
        and 25 hours. The corresponding "t=" line stop time would be the
        representation of the end of the last session three months later. By
        default, all subfields are in seconds, so the "r=" and "t=" lines might
        be the following:</t>
        <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[

   r=604800 3600 0 90000   ; 1 week, 1 hour, zero, 25 hours    
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>To make the description more compact, times may also be given in
        units of days, hours, or minutes. The syntax for these is a number
        immediately followed by a single case-sensitive character. Fractional
        units are not allowed -- a smaller unit should be used instead. The
        following unit specification characters are allowed:</t>

        <t>A "z=" line (zone-field) is an optional modifier to the repeat-fields it immediately follows.
        It does not apply to any other fields.</t>
        <t>To schedule a repeated session that spans a change from daylight
        saving time to standard time or vice versa, it is necessary to specify
        offsets from the base time. This is required because different time
        zones change time at different times of day, different countries
        change to or from daylight saving time on different dates, and some
        countries do not have daylight saving time at all.</t>
        <t>Thus, in order to schedule a session that is at the same time
        winter and summer, it must be possible to specify unambiguously by
        whose time zone a session is scheduled. To simplify this task for
        receivers, we allow the sender to specify the time (represented as seconds 
        since January 1, 1900 UTC) that a time zone adjustment happens  
        and the offset from the time when the session
        was first scheduled. The "z=" line allows the sender to specify a list
        of these adjustment times and offsets from the base time.</t>
        <t>An example might be the following:</t>
        <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[

        <t>This specifies that at time 3730928400 (Sun 25-Mar-2018 1:00 UTC, 
        the onset of British Summer Time)  the time base by which the

        that at time 3749680800 (Sun 28-Oct-2018 2:00 UTC, the end of British 
        Summer Time) the session's original time base is restored.
        Adjustments are always relative to the specified start time -- they

        <t>If a session is likely to last several years, it is expected that

        <t>Attributes are the primary means for extending SDP. Attributes may

        e.g., <xref target="RFC5576" format="default"/> and  
        <xref target="RFC8864" format="default"/>.)</t>
        <t>A media description may contain any number of "a=" lines (attribute-fields)
        that are media description specific. These are referred to as media-level
        attributes and add information about the media description. Attribute-fields
        can also be added before the first media description; these session-level
        attributes convey additional information that applies to the session
        as a whole rather than to individual media descriptions.</t>
        <t>Attribute-fields may be of two forms:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>A property attribute is simply of the form "a=&lt;attribute-name&gt;".
            These are binary attributes, and the presence of the attribute
            conveys that the attribute is a property of the session. An
            example might be "a=recvonly".</li>
          <li>A value attribute is of the form
            "a=&lt;attribute-name&gt;:&lt;attribute-value&gt;". For example, a whiteboard
            could have the value attribute "a=orient:landscape".</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Attribute interpretation depends on the media tool being invoked.
        Thus receivers of session descriptions should be configurable in their
        interpretation of session descriptions in general and of attributes in
        particular.</t>
        <t>Attribute names <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the US-ASCII subset of
        ISO-10646/UTF-8.</t>
        <t>Attribute values are octet strings, and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use any octet value
        except 0x00 (Nul), 0x0A (LF), and 0x0D (CR). By default, attribute
        values are to be interpreted as in ISO-10646 character set with UTF-8
        encoding. Unlike other text fields, attribute values are NOT normally
        affected by the "a=charset:" attribute as this would make comparisons
        against known values problematic. However, when an attribute is
        defined, it can be defined to be charset dependent, in which case its
        value should be interpreted in the session charset rather than in
        ISO-10646.</t>
        <t>Attributes <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be registered with IANA (see <xref target="iana" format="default"/>).

        <t>A session description may contain a number of media descriptions.
        Each media description starts with an "m=" line (media-field) and is terminated by

        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>&lt;media&gt;</dt>
          <dd>is the media type. This document defines the values "audio", "video", "text", "application", and "message". This list is extended by other memos and may be further extended by additional memos registering media types in the future (see <xref target="iana" format="default"/>). For example, <xref target="RFC6466" format="default"/> defined the "image" media type.</dd>
          <dt>&lt;port&gt;</dt>
          <dd><t>is the transport port to which the
            media stream is sent. The meaning of the transport port depends on
            the network being used as specified in the relevant "c=" line, and
            on the transport protocol defined in the &lt;proto&gt; subfield
            of the media-field. Other ports used by the media application
            (such as the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) port <xref target="RFC3550" format="default"/>) <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be derived algorithmically from the base
            media port or <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be specified in a separate attribute (for
            example, the "a=rtcp:" attribute as defined in <xref target="RFC3605" format="default"/>).</t>
    
          <t>If noncontiguous ports are used or if they don't follow the
            parity rule of even RTP ports and odd RTCP ports, the "a=rtcp:"
            attribute <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used. Applications that are requested to send
            media to a &lt;port&gt; that is odd and where the "a=rtcp:" attribute is
            present <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> subtract 1 from the RTP port: that is, they <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
            send the RTP to the port indicated in &lt;port&gt; and send the
            RTCP to the port indicated in the "a=rtcp:" attribute.</t>
       
            <t>For applications where hierarchically encoded streams are being
            sent to a unicast address, it may be necessary to specify multiple
            transport ports. This is done using a similar notation to that
            used for IP multicast addresses in the "c=" line: </t>
        <sourcecode name="" type=""><![CDATA[
    m=<media> <port>/<number of ports> <proto> <fmt> ...
]]></sourcecode>
            <t>In such a case, the ports used depend on the transport
            protocol. For RTP, the default is that only the even-numbered
            ports are used for data with the corresponding one-higher odd
            ports used for the RTCP belonging to the RTP session, and the
            &lt;number of ports&gt; denoting the number of RTP sessions. For
            example: </t>
        <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
       m=video 49170/2 RTP/AVP 31
]]></sourcecode>
          <t>would specify that ports 49170 and 49171 form one RTP/RTCP pair,
            and 49172 and 49173 form the second RTP/RTCP pair. RTP/AVP is the
            transport protocol, and 31 is the format (see the description of &lt;fmt&gt; below).</t>
          <t>This document does not include a mechanism for declaring hierarchically 
	    encoded streams using noncontiguous ports.
	    (There is currently no attribute defined that can accomplish this. 
	    The "a=rtcp:" attribute defined in <xref target="RFC3605" format="default"/> does not handle hierarchical encoding.)
	    If a need arises to declare noncontiguous ports then it will be necessary to define a new attribute to do so.</t>
            <t>If multiple addresses are specified in the "c=" line and
            multiple ports are specified in the "m=" line, a one-to-one
            mapping from port to the corresponding address is implied. For
            example: </t>
        <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
       m=video 49170/2 RTP/AVP 31
       c=IN IP4 233.252.0.1/127/2
]]></sourcecode>
          <t>would imply that address 233.252.0.1 is used with ports 49170
            and 49171, and address 233.252.0.2 is used with ports 49172 and
            49173.</t>
            <t>The mapping is similar if multiple addresses are specified using multiple "c=" lines.
            For example: </t>
        <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
       m=video 49170/2 RTP/AVP 31
       c=IN IP6 ff00::db8:0:101
       c=IN IP6 ff00::db8:0:102
]]></sourcecode>
          <t>would imply that address ff00::db8:0:101 is used with ports 49170
            and 49171, and address ff00::db8:0:102 is used with ports 49172 and
            49173.</t>
          <t>This document gives no meaning to assigning the same media address to 
	    multiple media descriptions. 
	    Doing so does not implicitly group those media descriptions in any way.
	    An explicit grouping framework (for example, <xref target="RFC5888" format="default"/>) 
	    should instead be used to express the intended semantics. 
	    For instance, see <xref target="RFC8843" format="default"/>.</t>

            of the transport protocol is dependent on the address type subfield
            in the relevant "c=" line. Thus a "c=" line with an address type of "IP4" indicates that
            the transport protocol runs over IPv4. The following transport
            protocols are defined, but may be extended through registration of
            new protocols with IANA (see <xref target="iana" format="default"/>): </t>
            <ul spacing="normal">

          <t>The main reason to specify the transport protocol in addition
            to the media format is that the same standard media formats may be
            carried over different transport protocols even when the network
            protocol is the same -- a historical example is vat (MBone's popular multimedia audio tool) Pulse Code
            Modulation (PCM) audio and RTP PCM audio; another might be TCP/RTP
            PCM audio. In addition, relays and monitoring tools that are
            transport-protocol-specific but format-independent are
            possible.</t>

          <dd><t>is a media format description. The
            fourth and any subsequent subfields describe the format of the

            of the &lt;proto&gt; subfield.</t>

          <t>If the &lt;proto&gt; subfield is "RTP/AVP" or "RTP/SAVP", the
            &lt;fmt&gt; subfields contain RTP payload type numbers.  When a list of 
payload type numbers is given, this implies that all of these 
payload formats MAY be used in the session, and these payload 
formats are listed in order of preference, with the first format listed 
being preferred. When multiple payload formats are listed,
the first acceptable payload format 
from the beginning of the list <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used for the session.

            For dynamic payload type assignments, the "a=rtpmap:"
            attribute (see <xref target="rtpmap" format="default"/>) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used to map from
            an RTP payload type number to a media encoding name that
            identifies the payload format. The "a=fmtp:" attribute <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used
            to specify format parameters (see <xref target="fmtp" format="default"/>).</t>
          <t>If the &lt;proto&gt; subfield is "udp", the &lt;fmt&gt;
            subfields <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reference a media type describing the format under
            the "audio", "video", "text", "application", or "message"
            top-level media types. The media type registration <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> define
            the packet format for use with UDP transport.</t>
          <t>For media using other transport protocols, the &lt;fmt&gt;
            subfield is protocol specific. Rules for interpretation of the
            &lt;fmt&gt; subfield <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be defined when registering new
            protocols (see <xref target="MediaTypes"/>).</t>
          <t><xref target="RFC4855" section="3" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/> states that the payload
            format (encoding) names defined in the RTP profile are commonly
            shown in upper case, while media subtype names are commonly shown
            in lower case. It also states that both of these names are
            case-insensitive in both places, similar to parameter names which

        <t>This attribute maps from an RTP payload type number (as used in an
        "m=" line) to an encoding name denoting the payload format to be used.

        parameters. Note that the payload type number is indicated in a 7-bit
        field, limiting the values to inclusively between 0 and 127.</t>
        <t>Although an RTP profile can make static assignments of payload type
        numbers to payload formats, it is more common for that assignment to
        be done dynamically using "a=rtpmap:" attributes. As an example of a
        static payload type, consider u-law PCM encoded single-channel audio
        sampled at 8 kHz. This is completely defined in the RTP audio/video
        profile as payload type 0, so there is no need for an "a=rtpmap:"
        attribute, and the media for such a stream sent to UDP port 49232 can
        be specified as: </t>
        <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
          m=audio 49232 RTP/AVP 0
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>An example of a dynamic payload type is 16-bit linear encoded
        stereo audio sampled at 16 kHz. If we wish to use the dynamic RTP/AVP
        payload type 98 for this stream, additional information is required to
        decode it: </t>
        <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
          m=audio 49232 RTP/AVP 98
          a=rtpmap:98 L16/16000/2
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>Up to one "a=rtpmap:" attribute can be defined for each media format
        specified. Thus, we might have the following: </t>
        <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
          m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96 97 98

          a=rtpmap:98 L16/11025/2
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>RTP profiles that specify the use of dynamic payload types <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
        define the set of valid encoding names and/or a means to register
        encoding names if that profile is to be used with SDP. The "RTP/AVP"
        and "RTP/SAVP" profiles use media subtypes for encoding names, under
        the top-level media type denoted in the "m=" line. In the example
        above, the media types are "audio/L8" and "audio/L16".</t>
        <t>For audio streams, encoding-params indicates the number
        of audio channels. This parameter is <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> and may be omitted if
        the number of channels is one, provided that no additional parameters
        are needed.</t>
        <t>For video streams, no encoding parameters are currently
        specified.</t>
        <t>Additional encoding parameters <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be defined in the future, but
        codec-specific parameters <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be added. Parameters added to an
        "a=rtpmap:" attribute <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> only be those required for a session
        directory to make the choice of appropriate media to participate in a
        session. Codec-specific parameters should be added in other attributes
        (for example, "a=fmtp:").</t>
        <t>Note: RTP audio formats typically do not include information about
        the number of samples per packet. If a non-default (as defined in the
        RTP Audio/Video Profile <xref target="RFC3551" format="default"/>) packetization is required, the "a=ptime:"

        <t>Multiple "a=sdplang:" attributes can be provided either at session or

        <t>As a session-level attribute, it specifies the language for the

the "a=lang:" attribute itself does not provide any information about multiple languages being intended to be used during the session, or if the intention is to only select one of the languages.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>SDP is frequently used with the <xref target="RFC3261" format="default">Session
      Initiation Protocol</xref> using the <xref target="RFC3264" format="default">offer/answer
      model</xref> to agree on parameters for unicast sessions. When used in
      this manner, the security considerations of those protocols apply.</t>
      <t>SDP is a session description format that describes multimedia
      sessions. Entities receiving and acting upon an SDP message <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be
      aware that a session description cannot be trusted unless it has been
      obtained by an authenticated and integrity-protected transport protocol from a known and trusted
      source. Many different transport protocols may be used to distribute
      session descriptions, and the nature of the authentication and integrity protection  will differ
      from transport to transport. For some transports, security features are
      often not deployed. In case a session description has not been obtained
      in a trusted manner, the endpoint <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> exercise care because, among
      other attacks, the media sessions received may not be the intended ones,
      the destination to where the media is sent  may not be the expected one, any
      of the parameters of the session may be incorrect, or the media security
      may be compromised. It is up to the endpoint to make a sensible decision,
      taking into account the security risks of the application and the user
      preferences - the endpoint may decide to ask the user whether or not to accept the
      session.</t>
      <t>On receiving a session description over an unauthenticated transport
      mechanism or from an untrusted party, software parsing the session description
      should take a few precautions. Similar concerns apply if integrity protection is not in place. 
      Session descriptions contain information
      required to start software on the receiver's system. Software that
      parses a session description <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be able to start other software
      except that which is specifically configured as appropriate software to
      participate in multimedia sessions. It is normally considered
      inappropriate for software parsing a session description to start, on a
      user's system, software that is appropriate to participate in multimedia
      sessions, without the user first being informed that such software will
      be started and giving the user's consent. Thus, a session description
      arriving by session announcement, email, session invitation, or WWW page
      <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> deliver the user into an interactive multimedia session unless
      the user has explicitly pre-authorized such action. As it is not always
      simple to tell whether or not a session is interactive, applications
      that are unsure should assume sessions are interactive.
      Software processing URLs contained in session descriptions should also 
      heed the security considerations identified in <xref target="RFC3986" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>In this specification, there are no attributes that would allow the
      recipient of a session description to be informed to start multimedia
      tools in a mode where they default to transmitting. Under some
      circumstances it might be appropriate to define such attributes. If this
      is done, an application parsing a session description containing such
      attributes <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> either ignore them or inform the user that joining
      this session will result in the automatic transmission of multimedia
      data. The default behavior for an unknown attribute is to ignore
      it.</t>
      <t>In certain environments, it has become common for intermediary
      systems to intercept and analyze session descriptions contained within
      other signaling protocols. This is done for a range of purposes,
      including but not limited to opening holes in firewalls to allow media
      streams to pass, or to mark, prioritize, or block traffic selectively.
      In some cases, such intermediary systems may modify the session
      description, for example, to have the contents of the session
      description match NAT bindings dynamically created. These behaviors are
      <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14> unless the session description is conveyed in such a
      manner that allows the intermediary system to conduct proper checks to
      establish the authenticity of the session description, and the authority
      of its source to establish such communication sessions. SDP by itself
      does not include sufficient information to enable these checks: they
      depend on the encapsulating protocol (e.g., SIP or RTSP).
      The use of some procedures and SDP extensions 
      (e.g., Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/> 
      and ICE-SIP-SDP <xref target="RFC8839" format="default"/>) 
      may avoid the need for intermediaries to modify SDP.</t>
      <t>SDP <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used to convey keying material (e.g., using 
      the "a=crypto:" attribute <xref target="RFC4568" format="default"/>) unless it can be guaranteed that the channel over 
      which the SDP is delivered is both private and authenticated.</t>

              <li>Attribute value: the name of an ABNF syntax rule defining
                the syntax of the value. Absence of a rule name indicates that
                the attribute takes no values. Enclosing the rule name in "["

            documented with a Standards Track RFC that specifies the attribute
            more precisely.</t>
            <t>Submitters of registrations should ensure that the
            specification is in the spirit of SDP attributes, most notably
            that the attribute is platform independent in the sense that it
            makes no implicit assumptions about operating systems and does not
            name specific pieces of software in a manner that might inhibit
            interoperability.</t>
            <t>Submitters of registrations should also carefully choose the
            attribute usage level. They should not choose only "session" when
            the attribute can have different values when media is
            disaggregated, i.e., when each "m=" section has its own IP address
            on a different endpoint. In that case, the attribute type chosen
            should be "session, media" or "media" (depending on desired semantics). 
            The default rule is that for all new
            SDP attributes that can occur both in session and media level, the
            media level overrides the session level. When this is not the case
            for a new SDP attribute, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be explicitly stated.</t>

      <name>Summary of Changes from RFC 4566</name>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Generally clarified and refined terminology. Aligned terms used in
   text with the ABNF. The terms &lt;attribute&gt;, &lt;att-field&gt;, and
   "att-field" are now &lt;attribute-name&gt;. The terms &lt;value&gt; and
   &lt;att-value&gt; are now &lt;attribute-value&gt;. The term "media" is now
   &lt;media&gt;. </li>
        <li>Identified now-obsolete items: "a=cat:" (<xref target="cat" format="default"/>), 
            "a=keywds:" (<xref target="keywds" format="default"/>), and "k=" 
            (<xref target="key-field" format="default"/>).</li>
        <li>Updated normative and informative references, and added references 
	       to additional relevant related RFCs.</li>
        <li>Reformatted the SDP Attributes section (<xref target="attrs" format="default"/>) for readability. 
	       The syntax of attribute values is now given in ABNF.</li>
        <li>Made mandatory the sending of RTCP with inactive media streams (<xref target="inactive" format="default"/>).</li>
        <li>Removed the section "Private Sessions". That section dated back to a time
	    when the primary use of SDP was with SAP (Session Announcement Protocol),
	    which has fallen out of use. Now the vast majority of uses of SDP is
	    for establishment of private sessions. The considerations for that are
	    covered in <xref target="security" format="default"/>.</li>
        <li>Expanded and clarified the specification of the "a=lang:" (<xref target="lang" format="default"/>) 
	       and "a=sdplang:" (<xref target="sdplang" format="default"/>) attributes.</li>
        <li>Removed some references to SAP because it is no longer in widespread use.</li>
        <li>Changed the way &lt;fmt&gt; values for UDP transport are registered (<xref target="protoreg" format="default"/>).</li>
        <li>Changed the mechanism and documentation required for 
	       registering new attributes (<xref target="newatt" format="default"/>).</li>
        <li>Tightened up IANA registration procedures for extensions. 
	       Removed phone number and long-form name (<xref target="SDP_Parameters" format="default"/>).</li>
        <li>Expanded the IANA &lt;nettype&gt; registry to identify valid &lt;addrtype&gt; subfields (<xref target="nettypereg" format="default"/>).</li>
        <li>Reorganized the several IANA "att-field" registries 
	       into a single &lt;attribute-name&gt; registry (<xref target="AttributeNames" format="default"/>).</li>
        <li>
		<t>Revised ABNF syntax (<xref target="abnf" format="default"/>) for clarity
                   and for alignment with text. Backward compatibility is 
                   maintained with a few exceptions.  Of particular note: </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>Revised the syntax of time descriptions ("t=", "r=", "z=") to 
               remove ambiguities. Clarified that "z=" only modifies the 
               immediately preceding "r=" lines. Made "z=" without a 
	       preceding "r=" a syntax error (<xref target="tzadj" format="default"/>). 
	       (This is incompatible with certain aberrant usage.)</li>
            <li>Updated the "IP6-address" and "IP6-multicast" rules, consistent 
               with the syntax in <xref target="RFC3986" format="default"/>, mirroring a bug fix made to 
               <xref target="RFC3261" format="default"/> by <xref target="RFC5954" format="default"/>. 
	       Removed rules that were unused as a result of this change.</li>
            <li>The "att-field" rule has been renamed "attribute-name" because
               elsewhere "*-field" always refers to a complete line. However,
               the rulename "att-field" remains defined as a synonym for
               backward compatibility with references from other RFCs.</li>
            <li>The "att-value" rule has been renamed "attribute-value".</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Revised normative statements that were redundant with ABNF syntax,
            making the text non-normative.</li>

        <li>Revised IPv4 unicast and multicast addresses in the 
	       example SDP descriptions per <xref target="RFC5735"/> and <xref
	       target="RFC5771"/>.</li>
        <li>Changed some examples to use IPv6 addresses, and added additional
            examples using IPv6.</li>
        <li>Incorporated case-insensitivity rules from <xref target="RFC4855" format="default"/>.</li>
        <li>Revised sections that incorrectly referenced NTP (<xref target="origin" format="default"/>, 
            <xref target="timing" format="default"/>, <xref target="repeattime" format="default"/>, and 
            <xref target="tzadj" format="default"/>).</li>
        <li>Clarified the explanation of the impact and use of the "a=charset:" attribute
            (<xref target="charset" format="default"/>).</li>
        <li>Revised the description of the "a=type:" attribute to remove implication that it
            sometimes changes the default media direction to something other than "a=sendrecv"
            (<xref target="type" format="default"/>).</li>
