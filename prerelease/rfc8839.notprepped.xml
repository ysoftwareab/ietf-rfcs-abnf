Readers should be familiar with the terminology defined in <xref

format="default"/>, and the following:
</t>

      <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
        <dt>Default Destination/Candidate:</dt>
        <dd>
The default destination for a component of a data stream is the transport
address that would be used by an agent that is not ICE aware. A default
candidate for a component is one whose transport address matches the default
destination for that component. For the RTP component, the default connection
address is in the "c=" line of the SDP, and the port and transport protocol
are in the "m=" line. For the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) component, the
address and port are indicated using the "rtcp" attribute defined in <xref
target="RFC3605" format="default"/>, if present; otherwise, the RTCP component
address is the same as the address of the RTP component, and its port is one
greater than the port of the RTP component.

        <t><xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/> defines ICE candidate
        exchange as the process for ICE agents (initiator and responder) to
        exchange their candidate information required for ICE processing at
        the agents. For the purposes of this specification, the candidate
        exchange process corresponds to the Offer/Answer protocol <xref

An agent compliant with this specification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include an SDP "ice-options"

attributes for both the RTP and RTCP components.
</t>
          <t>
The agent includes an SDP "rtcp" attribute following the procedures
in <xref target="RFC3605" format="default"/>. Hence, in the cases where the RTCP
port value is one higher than the RTP port value and the RTCP component
address the same as the address of the RTP component, the SDP "rtcp" attribute
might be omitted.
</t>
          <t>
NOTE: <xref target="RFC5245" format="default"/> required that an agent always includes the 
SDP "rtcp" attribute, even if the RTCP port value was one higher than the
RTP port value. This specification aligns the "rtcp" attribute procedures
with <xref target="RFC3605" format="default"/>.
</t>

          <name>Verifying ICE Support Procedures</name>
          <t>
            An ICE agent indicates support of ICE by including
            at least the SDP "ice-pwd" and "ice-ufrag" attributes in an offer or answer.
            An ICE agent compliant with this specification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also include an 
            SDP "ice-options" attribute with an "ice2" attribute value.
          </t>
          <t>
The agents will proceed with the ICE procedures defined in <xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/> and
this specification if, for each data stream in the SDP it received, the
default destination for each component of that data stream appears in
a "candidate" attribute. For example, in the case of RTP, the
connection address, port, and transport protocol in the
"c=" and "m=" lines, respectively, appear in a "candidate"
attribute, and the value in the "rtcp" attribute appears in a "candidate"
attribute.
</t>
          <t>
This specification provides no guidance on how an agent should proceed
in the cases where the above condition is not met with the few
exceptions noted below:
</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
            <li>
The presence of certain Application Layer Gateways might modify
the transport address information as described in <xref target="sec-alg-sip" format="default"/>.
The behavior of the responding agent in such a situation is
implementation dependent. Informally, the responding agent might
consider the mismatched transport address information as a
plausible new candidate learned from the peer and continue its
ICE processing with that transport address included.
Alternatively, the responding agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include an "ice-mismatch"
attribute in its answer for such data streams.  If an agent chooses to
include an "ice-mismatch" attribute in its answer for a data stream,
then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also omit "candidate" attributes, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> terminate
the usage of ICE procedures, and <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/> 
procedures <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used instead for this data stream.

</li>
            <li>
The transport address from the peer for the default destination
is set to IPv4/IPv6 address values "0.0.0.0"/"::" and port value of "9".
This <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be considered as an ICE failure by the peer agent, and
the ICE processing <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> continue as usual.

</li>
            <li>
In some cases, the controlling/initiator agent may receive an SDP answer
that may omit "candidate" attributes for the data stream, and instead
include a media-level "ice-mismatch" attribute.  This signals to the
offerer that the answerer supports ICE, but that ICE processing was not
used for this data stream. In this case, ICE processing <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be terminated
for this data stream, and <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/> procedures <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be followed instead.

</li>
            <li>
The transport address from the peer for the default destination is
an FQDN. Regardless of the procedures used to resolve FQDN or the
resolution result, this <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be considered as an ICE failure by
the peer agent, and the ICE processing <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> continue as usual.

Once the agent has successfully nominated a pair <xref target="RFC8445"
format="default"/>, the state of the checklist associated with the pair is set
to Completed. Once the state of each checklist is set to either Completed or
Failed, for each Completed checklist, the agent checks whether the nominated
pair matches the default candidate pair. If there are one or more pairs that
do not match, and the peer did not indicate support for the 'ice2' ice-option,
the controlling agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> generate a subsequent offer in which
the connection address, port, and transport protocol in the "c=" and "m="
lines associated with each data stream match the corresponding local
information of the nominated pair for that data stream (<xref
target="sec-send-subsequent-offer-after-nom" format="default"/>).  If the peer
did indicate support for the 'ice2' ice-option, the controlling agent does not
immediately need to generate an updated offer in order to align a connection
address, port, and protocol with a nominated pair. However, later in the
session, whenever the controlling agent does send a subsequent offer, it
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> do the alignment as described above.
          </t>
          <t>
If there are one or more checklists with the state set to Failed, the
controlling agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> generate a subsequent offer in order to
remove the associated data streams by setting the port value of the data
streams to zero (<xref target="sec-send-subsequent-offer-remove"
format="default"/>), even if the peer did indicate support for the 'ice2'
ice-option. If needed, such offer is used to align the connection address,
port, and transport protocol, as described above.
          </t>
          <t>
As described in <xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/>, once the controlling agent has nominated
a candidate pair for a checklist, the agent <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> nominate another pair
for that checklist during the lifetime of the ICE session (i.e., until
ICE is restarted).
</t>

          <t>
  <xref target="RFC8863" format="default"/> provides a mechanism for
  allowing the ICE process to run long enough in order to find working candidate pairs,
  by waiting for potential peer-reflexive candidates, even though no candidate pairs were
  received from the peer or all current candidate pairs associated with a checklist have
  either failed or been discarded.

An agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> restart ICE processing for an existing data stream <xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/>.
</t>
              <t>
The rules governing the ICE restart imply that setting the connection address
in the "c=" line to "0.0.0.0" (for IPv4)/ "::" (for IPv6) will cause an ICE restart.
Consequently, ICE implementations <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> utilize this mechanism for call hold,
and instead <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use "inactive" and "sendonly" as described in 
<xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/>.
</t>
              <t>
To restart ICE, an agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> change both the "ice-pwd" and the "ice-ufrag" for
the data stream in an offer. However, it is permissible to use a session-level
attribute in one offer, but to provide the same "ice-pwd" or "ice-ufrag" as a
media-level attribute in a subsequent offer. This <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be considered
as ICE restart.
</t>
              <t>
An agent sets the rest of the ICE-related fields in the SDP for this data stream as it
would in an initial offer of this data stream (<xref target="sec-encoding" format="default"/>).
Consequently, the set of candidates <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include some, none, or all of the
previous candidates for that data stream and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include a totally new set of
candidates. The agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> modify the attribute values of the SDP "ice-options" and
SDP "ice-pacing" attributes, and it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> change its role using the SDP "ice-lite" attribute.
The agent <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> modify the SDP "ice-options", "ice-pacing", and "ice-lite" attributes in a
subsequent offer unless the offer is sent in order to request an ICE restart.

Once a candidate pair has been nominated for a data stream, the connection address,
port, and transport protocol in each "c=" and "m=" line associated with that data
stream <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> match the data associated with the nominated pair for that

In addition, if the agent is controlling, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the
"remote-candidates" attribute for each data stream whose checklist
is in the Completed state. The attribute contains the remote candidates
corresponding to the nominated pair in the valid list for each
component of that data stream. It is needed to avoid a race condition
whereby the controlling agent chooses its pairs, but the updated offer
beats the connectivity checks to the controlled agent, which doesn't
even know these pairs are valid, let alone selected. See <xref target="sec-why-remote" format="default"/>

If the ICE state is Running, a lite implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include all of
its candidates for each component of each data stream in "candidate"
attributes in any subsequent offer. The candidates are formed identically
to the procedures for initial offers.

A lite implementation <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> add additional host candidates in a

to modify the username fragments and passwords, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> request an 
ICE restart (<xref target="sec-suboffer-restarts" format="default"/>) for that data stream.
</t>
            <t>
If ICE has completed for a data stream, and if the agent is controlled,
the default destination for that data stream <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to the
remote candidate of the candidate pair for that component in the valid list.
For a lite implementation, there is always just a single candidate pair in
the valid list for each component of a data stream. Additionally, the agent
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include a "candidate" attribute for each default destination.
</t>
            <t>
If the ICE state is Completed, and if the agent is controlling (which only
happens when both agents are lite), the agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the

If ICE is Completed for a data stream, and the offer for that data
stream lacked the "remote-candidates" attribute, the rules for
construction of the answer are identical to those for the offerer,
except that the answerer <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include the "remote-candidates"
attribute in the answer.
</t>
          <t>
A controlled agent will receive an offer with the "remote-candidates"
attribute for a data stream when its peer has concluded ICE processing
for that data stream. This attribute is present in the
offer to deal with a race condition between the receipt of the offer,
and the receipt of the Binding response that tells the answerer the
candidate that will be selected by ICE. See <xref target="sec-why-remote" format="default"/> for an
explanation of this race condition. Consequently, processing of an
offer with this attribute depends on the winner of the race.
</t>
          <t>
The agent forms a candidate pair for each component of the data stream by:
</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
Setting the remote candidate equal to the offerer's default
destination for that component (i.e., the contents of the "m=" and
"c=" lines for RTP, and the "rtcp" attribute for RTCP)

</li>
            <li>
Setting the local candidate equal to the transport address for
that same component in the "remote-candidates" attribute in the
offer.

</li>
          </ul>
          <t>
The agent then sees if each of these candidate pairs is present
in the valid list.  If a particular pair is not in the valid list,
the check has "lost" the race.  Call such a pair a "losing pair".
</t>
          <t>
The agent finds all the pairs in the checklist whose remote
candidates equal the remote candidate in the losing pair:
</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">

            <li>
If none of the pairs is In-Progress, and at least one is Failed,
it is most likely that a network failure, such as a network
partition or serious packet loss, has occurred.  The agent <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
generate an answer for this data stream as if the "remote-
candidates" attribute had not been present, and then restart ICE
for this stream.

</li>
            <li>
If at least one of the pairs is In-Progress, the agent <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> wait
for those checks to complete, and as each completes, redo the
processing in this section until there are no losing pairs.

</li>
          </ul>
          <t>
Once there are no losing pairs, the agent can generate the answer.
It <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> set the default destination for media to the candidates in
the "remote-candidates" attribute from the offer (each of which will
now be the local candidate of a candidate pair in the valid list).
It <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include a "candidate" attribute in the answer for each
candidate in the "remote-candidates" attribute in the offer.

For a given data stream, the answerer <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include the same

subsequent answer unless the answer is sent for an offer that was used to request an ICE restart
(<xref target="sec-suboffer-restarts" format="default"/>). If any of the SDP attributes have been modified in

If the received offer contains the "remote-candidates" attribute for a
data stream, the agent forms a candidate pair for each component of the
data stream by:
</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
Setting the remote candidate equal to the offerer's default destination
for that component (i.e., the contents of the "m=" and "c=" lines for RTP,
and the "rtcp" attribute for RTCP).

</li>
              <li>
Setting the local candidate equal to the transport address for that same
component in the "remote-candidates" attribute in the offer.

</li>
            </ul>
            <t>
The state of the checklist associated with that data stream is set to Completed.
</t>
            <t>
Furthermore, if the agent believed it was controlling, but the offer contained
the "remote-candidates" attribute, both agents believe they are controlling.
In this case, both would have sent updated offers around the same time.
</t>
            <t>
However, the signaling protocol carrying the offer/answer exchanges
will have resolved this glare condition, so that one agent is always
the 'winner' by having its offer received before its peer has sent
an offer. The winner takes the role of controlling, so that the
loser (the answerer under consideration in this section) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
change its role to controlled.
</t>
            <t>
   Consequently, if the agent was controlling based on the rules 
   in <xref target="RFC8445" sectionFormat="of" section="8.2" format="default"/>
   and was going to send an updated offer, it no longer needs to.

</t>
            <t>
Besides the potential role change, change in the valid list, and
state changes, the construction of the answer is performed identically
to the construction of an offer.

There may be certain situations where the offerer receives
an SDP answer that lacks ICE candidates although the initial answer
included them. One example of such an "unexpected" answer might 
happen when an ICE-unaware Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA)
introduces a media server during call hold using third party
call control procedures <xref target="RFC3725" format="default"/>. 
Omitting further details on how this is done, this could
result in an answer that was constructed by the B2BUA 
being received at the holding UA. With the B2BUA being
ICE-unaware, that answer would not include ICE candidates.
</t>
            <t>
Receiving an answer without ICE attributes in this situation might be
unexpected, but would not necessarily impair the user experience.
</t>
            <t>
When the offerer receives an answer indicating support for ICE, the
offer performs one of the following actions:
</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
If the offer was a restart, the agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> perform ICE restart
procedures as specified in <xref target="sec-restart-subsequent" format="default"/>.</li>
              <li>
If the offer/answer exchange removed a data stream, or an
answer rejected an offered data stream, an agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> flush the
valid list for that data stream. It <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also terminate any
STUN transactions in progress for that data stream.
</li>
              <li>
If the offer/answer exchange added a new data stream, the agent
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> create a new checklist for it (and an empty valid list to
start of course), which in turn triggers the candidate
processing procedures <xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/>.
</li>
              <li>
If the checklist state associated with a data stream is Running, the agent
recomputes the checklist. If a pair on the new checklist was
also on the previous checklist, its candidate pair state is copied over.
  Otherwise, its candidate pair state is set to Frozen. If none of the checklists
  are active (meaning that the candidate pair states in each checklist
  are Frozen), appropriate procedures in <xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/>
  are performed to move candidate pair(s) to the Waiting state to
  further continue ICE processing.
</li>
              <li>
If the ICE state is Completed, and the SDP answer conforms to
<xref target="sec-subsequent-answer" format="default"/>, the agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> remain in the 
Completed ICE state.

</li>
            </ul>
            <t>
However, if the ICE support is no longer indicated in the SDP answer,
the agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> fall back to <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/> 
procedures and <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> drop the dialog because of the 
missing ICE support or unexpected answer.

        <t>
The "ice-pwd" and "ice-ufrag" attributes can appear at either the session-level
or media-level. When present in both, the value in the media-level takes precedence.
Thus, the value at the session-level is effectively a default that applies to all

or media-level, there <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be an "ice-pwd" and "ice-ufrag" attribute for each data stream.

</t>
        <t>
The "ice-ufrag" and "ice-pwd" attributes <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be chosen randomly at the beginning of

</t>
        <t><xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/> requires the "ice-ufrag" attribute to contain at least 24 bits of
randomness, and the "ice-pwd" attribute to contain at least 128 bits of
randomness. This means that the "ice-ufrag"
attribute will be at least 4 characters long, and the "ice-pwd" at least 22 characters long,
since the grammar for these attributes allows for 6 bits of information per character.
The attributes <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be longer than 4 and 22 characters, respectively, of course, up to
256 characters. The upper limit allows for buffer sizing in implementations.
Its large upper limit allows for increased amounts of randomness to be added over time.
For compatibility with the 512-character limitation for the STUN username attribute value
and for bandwidth conservation considerations, the "ice-ufrag" attribute <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be longer

Note that ICE is not intended for NAT traversal for SIP signaling, which is assumed to be
provided via another mechanism <xref target="RFC5626" format="default"/>.
</t>
      <t>
When ICE is used with SIP, forking may result in a single offer generating a
multiplicity of answers. In that case, ICE proceeds completely in parallel and
independently for each answer, treating the combination of its offer and
each answer as an independent offer/answer exchange, with its own set of local
candidates, pairs, checklists, states, and so on.
</t>
      <section anchor="sec-latency" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Latency Guidelines</name>
        <t>
ICE requires a series of STUN-based connectivity checks to take place between
endpoints. These checks start from the answerer on generation of its answer,
and start from the offerer when it receives the answer.
These checks can take time to complete, and as such, the selection of
messages to use with offers and answers can affect perceived user latency.
Two latency figures are of particular interest. These are the post-pickup delay
and the post-dial delay. The post-pickup delay refers to the time between when
a user "answers the phone" and when any speech they utter can be delivered to
the caller. The post-dial delay refers to the time between when a user enters
the destination address for the user and ringback begins as a consequence of
having successfully started alerting the called user agent.
</t>
        <t>
Two cases can be considered -- one where the offer is present in the initial
INVITE and one where it is in a response.
</t>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Offer in INVITE</name>
          <t>
To reduce post-dial delays, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the caller begin gathering
candidates prior to actually sending its initial INVITE, so that the candidates
can be provided in the INVITE. This can be started upon
user interface cues that a call is pending, such as activity on a keypad or
the phone going off-hook.
</t>
          <t>
On the receipt of the offer, the answerer <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> generate an answer in a
provisional response as soon as it has completed gathering
the candidates. ICE requires that a provisional response with an SDP be
transmitted reliably. This can be done through the existing
Provisional Response Acknowledgment (PRACK)
mechanism <xref target="RFC3262" format="default"/> or through an ICE-specific optimization, wherein,
the agent retransmits the provisional response with the exponential backoff
timers described in <xref target="RFC3262" format="default"/>. Such retransmissions <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> cease on receipt
of a STUN Binding request with the transport address matching the candidate address
for one of the data streams signaled in that SDP or on transmission of the answer
in a 2xx response. If no Binding request is received prior to the last retransmit,
the agent does not consider the session terminated. For the ICE-lite peers, the 
agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> cease retransmitting the 18x response after
sending it four times since there will be no Binding request sent, and
the number four is arbitrarily chosen to limit the number of 18x retransmits.
</t>
          <t>
Once the answer has been sent, the agent <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> begin its connectivity checks.
Once candidate pairs for each component of a data stream enter the valid list,
the answerer can begin sending media on that data stream.
</t>
          <t>
However, prior to this point, any media that needs to be sent towards the
caller (such as SIP early media <xref target="RFC3960" format="default"/>) <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be transmitted. For this
reason, implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> delay alerting the called party until candidates
for each component of each data stream have entered the valid list.
In the case of a PSTN gateway, this would mean that the setup message into the
PSTN is delayed until this point. Doing this increases the post-dial delay, but
has the effect of eliminating 'ghost rings'.
Ghost rings are cases where the called party hears the phone ring, picks up, but
hears nothing and cannot be heard. This technique works without requiring support
for, or usage of, preconditions <xref target="RFC3312" format="default"/>. It also has the benefit of guaranteeing
that not a single packet of media will get clipped, so that post-pickup delay is zero.
If an agent chooses to delay local alerting in this way, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> generate a 180
response once alerting begins.

          <t>
In addition to uses where the offer is in an INVITE, and the answer is in the
provisional and/or 200 OK response, ICE works with cases where the offer appears
in the response.
In such cases, which are common in third party call control <xref target="RFC3725" format="default"/>, ICE
agents <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> generate their offers in a reliable provisional response
(which <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> utilize <xref target="RFC3262" format="default"/>), and not alert the user on receipt of the INVITE.
The answer will arrive in a PRACK.
This allows for ICE processing to take place prior to alerting, so that there is no
post-pickup delay, at the expense of increased call setup delays.
Once ICE completes, the callee can alert the user and then generate a 200 OK
when they answer.
The 200 OK would contain no SDP, since the offer/answer exchange has completed.
</t>
          <t>
Alternatively, agents <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> place the offer in a 2xx instead (in which case the
answer comes in the ACK).
When this happens, the callee will alert the user on receipt of the INVITE,
and the ICE exchanges will take place only after the user answers.
This has the effect of reducing call-setup delay, but can cause substantial
post-pickup delays and media clipping.

ICE interacts very well with forking.
Indeed, ICE fixes some of the problems associated with forking.
Without ICE, when a call forks and the caller receives multiple incoming
data streams, it cannot determine which data stream corresponds to
which callee.
</t>
        <t>
With ICE, this problem is resolved.
The connectivity checks which occur prior to transmission of media carry
username fragments which in turn are correlated to a specific callee.
Subsequent media packets that arrive on the same candidate pair as the
connectivity check will be associated with that same callee.
Thus, the caller can perform this correlation as long as it has received an answer.

targets for media in an offer/answer.
If ICE changes the transport address where media is received, this change
is reflected in an updated offer that changes the default destination for
media to match ICE's selection. As such, it appears like any other re-INVITE would,
and is fully treated in RFCs 3312 and 4032, which apply without regard to the fact
that the destination for media is changing due to ICE negotiations occurring

        Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) are functions present in a Network Address Translation (NAT)
        device that inspect the contents of packets and modify them, in order to facilitate NAT traversal
        for application protocols. Session Border Controllers (SBCs) are close cousins of ALGs, but are
        less transparent since they actually exist as application-layer SIP intermediaries. ICE has
        interactions with SBCs and ALGs.
      </t>
      <t>
        If an ALG is SIP aware but not ICE aware, ICE will work through it as long as the ALG correctly
        modifies the SDP. A correct ALG implementation behaves as follows:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
            The ALG does not modify the "m=" and "c=" lines or the "rtcp" attribute if they contain

          </li>
        <li>
          <t>
            If the "m=" and "c=" lines contain internal addresses, the modification depends on the state of the ALG:

          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
                If the ALG already has a binding established that maps an external port to an internal connection
                address and port matching the values in the "m=" and "c=" lines or "rtcp" attribute, the ALG uses that
                binding instead of creating a new one.
              </li>
            <li>
                If the ALG does not already have a binding, it creates a new one and modifies the SDP, rewriting

        Unfortunately, many ALGs are known to work poorly in these corner cases.

        ICE can help diagnose these conditions, which often show up as a mismatch between the set of candidates and
        the "m=" and "c=" lines and "rtcp" attributes. The "ice-mismatch" attribute is used for this purpose.
      </t>
      <t>
        ICE works best through ALGs when the signaling is run over TLS.
        This prevents the ALG from manipulating the SDP messages and interfering with ICE operation.
        Implementations that are expected to be deployed behind ALGs <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide for TLS transport of the SDP.
      </t>
      <t>
        If an SBC is SIP aware but not ICE aware, the result depends on the behavior of the SBC.
        If it is acting as a proper Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), the SBC will remove any SDP attributes
        it doesn't understand, including the ICE attributes. Consequently, the call will appear to both
        endpoints as if the other side doesn't support ICE. This will result in ICE being disabled, and
        media flowing through the SBC, if the SBC has requested it. If, however, the SBC passes the ICE attributes
        without modification, yet modifies the default destination for media (contained in the "m=" and "c=" lines
        and "rtcp" attribute), this will be detected as an ICE mismatch, and ICE processing is aborted for the call.
        It is outside of the scope of ICE for it to act as a tool for "working around" SBCs.
        If one is present, ICE will not be used and the SBC techniques take precedence.

        <name>Attacks on the Offer/Answer Exchanges</name>
        <t>
          An attacker that can modify or disrupt the offer/answer exchanges themselves can readily
          launch a variety of attacks with ICE. They could direct media to a target of a DoS attack,
          they could insert themselves into the data stream, and so on. These are similar to the general
          security considerations for offer/answer exchanges, and the security considerations in
          <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/> apply. These require techniques for message integrity and encryption
          for offers and answers, which are satisfied by the TLS mechanism <xref target="RFC3261" format="default"/> when
          SIP is used. As such, the usage of TLS with ICE is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>.

        <name>The Voice Hammer Attack</name>
        <t>
          The voice hammer attack is an amplification attack, and can be triggered even if the attacker
          is an authenticated and valid participant in a session.
          In this attack, the attacker initiates sessions to other agents, and maliciously includes
          the connection address and port of a DoS target as the destination for media traffic
          signaled in the SDP. This causes substantial amplification; a single offer/answer exchange
          can create a continuing flood of media packets, possibly at high rates (consider video sources).
          The use of ICE can help to prevent against this attack.
        </t>

        <t>
          Specifically, if ICE is used, the agent receiving the malicious SDP will first perform connectivity
          checks to the target of media before sending media there. If this target is a third-party host, the
          checks will not succeed, and media is never sent.  The ICE extension defined in <xref target="RFC7675" format="default"/>
          can be used to further protect against voice hammer attacks.
        </t>
        <t>
          Unfortunately, ICE doesn't help if it's not used, in which case an attacker could simply
          send the offer without the ICE parameters. However, in environments where the set of clients is known,
          and is limited to ones that support ICE, the server can reject any offers or answers that don't
          indicate ICE support.
        </t>
        <t>
          SIP user agents (UA) <xref target="RFC3261" format="default"/> that are not willing to receive non-ICE answers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include
          an "ice" option tag <xref target="RFC5768" format="default"/> in the SIP Require header field in their offer. UAs that
          reject non-ICE offers will generally use a 421 response code, together with an option tag "ice" in the
          Require header field in the response.

      <name>The "remote-candidates" Attribute</name>

      <t>
The "remote-candidates" attribute exists to eliminate a race condition between the updated offer and the response to the STUN Binding request that moved a candidate into the valid list.
This race condition is shown in <xref target="fig-race-flow" format="default"/>.
On receipt of message 4, agent L adds a candidate pair to the valid list.
If there was only a single data stream with a single component, agent L could now send an updated offer.
   However, the check from agent R has not yet 
   received a response, and agent R receives the updated offer 
   (message 7) before getting the response (message 9).  
Thus, it does not yet know that this particular pair is valid.
To eliminate this condition, the actual candidates at R that were selected by the offerer (the remote candidates) are included in the offer itself, and the answerer delays its answer until those pairs validate.

      <name>Why Is the Conflict Resolution Mechanism Needed?</name>
      <t>
When ICE runs between two peers, one agent acts as controlled, and the other as controlling.
Rules are defined as a function of implementation type and offerer/answerer to determine who is controlling and who is controlled.
However, the specification mentions that, in some cases, both sides might believe they are controlling, or both sides might believe they are controlled.
How can this happen?
</t>
      <t>
The condition when both agents believe they are controlled shows up in third party call control cases.
Consider the following flow:
</t>
      <figure anchor="fig-conflict">
        <name>Role Conflict Flow</name>
        <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
          A         Controller          B
          |(1) INV()     |              |
          |<-------------|              |
          |(2) 200(SDP1) |              |
          |------------->|              |
          |              |(3) INV()     |
          |              |------------->|
          |              |(4) 200(SDP2) |
          |              |<-------------|
          |(5) ACK(SDP2) |              |
          |<-------------|              |
          |              |(6) ACK(SDP1) |
          |              |------------->|
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
This flow is a variation on flow III of RFC 3725 <xref target="RFC3725" format="default"/>.
In fact, it works better than flow III since it produces fewer messages.
In this flow, the controller sends an offerless INVITE to agent A, which responds with its offer, SDP1.
The agent then sends an offerless INVITE to agent B, which it responds to with its offer, SDP2.
The controller then uses the offer from each agent to generate the answers.
When this flow is used, ICE will run between agents A and B, but both will believe they are in the controlling role.
With the role conflict resolution procedures, this flow will function properly when ICE is used.
</t>
      <t>
At this time, there are no documented flows that can result in the case where both agents believe they are controlled.
However, the conflict resolution procedures allow for this case, should a flow arise that would fit into this category.
</t>
    </section>
    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Why Send an Updated Offer?</name>
      <t>
<xref target="RFC8445" section="12.1" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/> 
describes rules for sending media.
Both agents can send media once ICE checks complete, without waiting for an updated offer.
Indeed, the only purpose of the updated offer is to "correct" the SDP so that the default destination for media matches where media is being sent based on ICE procedures (which will be the highest-priority nominated candidate pair).
</t>
      <t>
This raises the question -- why is the updated offer/answer exchange needed at all?
Indeed, in a pure offer/answer environment, it would not be.
The offerer and answerer will agree on the candidates to use through ICE, and then can begin using them.
As far as the agents themselves are concerned, the updated offer/answer provides no new information.
However, in practice, numerous components along the signaling path look at the SDP information.
These include entities performing off-path QoS reservations, NAT traversal components such as ALGs and Session Border Controllers (SBCs), and diagnostic tools that passively monitor the network.
For these tools to continue to function without change, the core property of SDP -- that the existing, pre-ICE definitions of the addresses used for media -- the "m=" and "c=" lines and the "rtcp" attribute -- must be retained.
For this reason, an updated offer must be sent.
