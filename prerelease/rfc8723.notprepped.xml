    <abstract>
      <t>In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary
to be able to manipulate some parameters in Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
packets, while still providing strong end-to-end security
guarantees. This document defines a cryptographic transform for the
Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) that uses two separate but related
cryptographic operations to provide hop-by-hop and end-to-end
security guarantees.  Both the end-to-end and hop-by-hop
cryptographic algorithms can utilize an authenticated encryption
with associated data (AEAD) algorithm or take advantage of future SRTP
transforms with different properties.

      <t>Cloud conferencing systems that are based on switched conferencing
have a central Media Distributor (MD) device that receives media from
endpoints and distributes it to other endpoints, but does not need
to interpret or change the media content.  For these systems, it is
desirable to have one cryptographic key that enables encryption and
authentication of the media
end-to-end while still allowing certain information in the header of
an RTP packet to be changed by the MD.  
At the same time, a separate cryptographic key
provides integrity and optional confidentiality for the media
flowing between the MD and the endpoints.  The
framework document <xref target="I-D.ietf-perc-private-media-framework" format="default"/>
describes this concept in more detail.
</t>
      <t>This specification defines a transform for 
SRTP that uses 1) the AES Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) algorithm <xref target="RFC7714" format="default"/> to
provide encryption and integrity for an RTP packet for the
end-to-end cryptographic key and 2) a hop-by-hop cryptographic
encryption and integrity between the endpoint and the MD. 
The MD decrypts and checks integrity of
the hop-by-hop security. The MD <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> change some of
the RTP header information that would impact the end-to-end
integrity. In that case, the original value of any RTP header field
that is changed is included in an "Original Header Block" that is
added to the packet. The new RTP packet is encrypted with the
hop-by-hop cryptographic algorithm before it is sent. The receiving
endpoint decrypts and checks integrity using the hop-by-hop
cryptographic algorithm and then replaces any parameters the MD 
changed using the information in the Original Header
Block before decrypting and checking the end-to-end integrity.
</t>
      <t>One can think of the double transform as a normal SRTP transform for encrypting
the RTP in a way such that things that only know half of the key, can
decrypt and modify part of the RTP packet but not other parts,
including the media payload.

      <name>Cryptographic Context</name>

      <t>This specification uses a cryptographic context with two parts:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>An inner (end-to-end) part that is used by endpoints that originate and
consume media to ensure the integrity of media end-to-end, and</li>
        <li>An outer (hop-by-hop) part that is used between endpoints and MDs 
to ensure the integrity of media over a single hop and to
enable an MD to modify certain RTP header fields. RTCP
is also handled using the hop-by-hop cryptographic part.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> cipher for the hop-by-hop and end-to-end algorithms is
AES-GCM.  Other combinations of SRTP ciphers that support the
procedures in this document can be added to the IANA registry.
</t>
      <t>The keys and salt for these algorithms are generated with the following
steps:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Generate key and salt values of the length required for the combined
inner (end-to-end) and outer (hop-by-hop) algorithms.</li>
        <li>Assign the key and salt values generated for the inner (end-to-end)
algorithm to the first half of the key and the first half of the
salt for the double algorithm.</li>
        <li>Assign the key and salt values for the outer (hop-by-hop) algorithm
to the second half of the key and second half of the salt for the
double algorithm. The first half of the key is referred to as the
inner key while the second half is referred to as the outer key.
When a key is used by a cryptographic algorithm, the salt that is used is
the part of the salt generated with that key.</li>
        <li>the synchronization source (SSRC) is the same for both the inner and outer algorithms as
it cannot be changed.</li>
        <li>The sequence number (SEQ) and rollover counter (ROC) are tracked independently for the inner and outer
algorithms.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>If the MD is to be able to modify header fields but
not decrypt the payload, then it must have a cryptographic key for the
outer algorithm but not the inner (end-to-end) algorithm.  This
document does not define how the MD should be
provisioned with this information.  One possible way to provide
keying material for the outer (hop-by-hop) algorithm is to use

        <name>Key Derivation</name>
        <t>Although SRTP uses a single master key to derive keys for an SRTP
session, this transform requires separate inner and outer keys.
In order to allow the inner and outer keys to be managed
independently via the master key, the transforms defined in this
document <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used with the following pseudorandom function
(PRF), which preserves the separation between the two halves of the
key.  Given a positive integer <tt>n</tt> representing the desired output

      <t>The OHB contains the original values of any
modified RTP header fields. In the encryption process, the OHB is
included in an SRTP packet as described in <xref target="rtp-operations" format="default"/>.  In the
decryption process, the receiving endpoint uses it to reconstruct
the original RTP header so that it can pass the proper additional authenticated data (AAD) value to
the inner transform.
</t>
      <t>The OHB can reflect modifications to the following fields in an RTP header: the
payload type (PT), the SEQ, and the marker bit.  All other fields in the
RTP header <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> remain unmodified; since the OHB cannot reflect their original
values, the receiver will be unable to verify the end-to-end integrity of the packet.
</t>
      <t>The OHB has the following syntax (in ABNF <xref target="RFC5234" format="default"/>):

PT = OCTET
SEQ = 2OCTET
Config = OCTET
OHB = [ PT ] [ SEQ ] Config
]]></sourcecode>
      <t>If present, the PT and SEQ parts of the OHB contain the original payload type
and sequence number fields, respectively. The final "Config" octet of the OHB
specifies whether these fields are present, and the original value of the
marker bit (if necessary):

      <t>In particular, an all-zero OHB Config octet (<tt>0x00</tt>) indicates that
there have been no modifications from the original header.

      <t>As implied by the use of the word "double" above, this transform
applies AES-GCM to the SRTP packet twice.  This allows media
distributors to be able to modify some header fields while allowing
endpoints to verify the end-to-end integrity of a packet.
</t>
      <t>The first, "inner" application of AES-GCM encrypts the SRTP payload
and protects the integrity of a version of the SRTP header with extensions
truncated.  Omitting extensions from the inner integrity check means
that they can be modified by an MD holding only the outer key.
</t>
      <t>The second, "outer" application of AES-GCM encrypts the ciphertext
produced by the inner encryption (i.e., the encrypted payload and
authentication tag), plus an OHB that expresses any changes made
between the inner and outer transforms.
</t>
      <t>An MD that has the outer key but not the inner key may

      <t>Repair mechanisms, in general, will need to perform recovery on
encrypted packets (double-encrypted when using this transform),
since the MD does not have access to the plaintext of
the packet, only an intermediate, E2E-encrypted form.
</t>
      <t>When the recovery mechanism calls for the recovery packet itself to
be encrypted, it is encrypted with only the outer, hop-by-hop key.  This
allows an MD to generate recovery packets without
having access to the inner, end-to-end keys.  However, it also results in
recovery packets being triple-encrypted, twice for the base
transform, and once for the recovery protection.

        <t>When using RTX <xref target="RFC4588" format="default"/> with the double transform, the cached payloads <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the
double-encrypted packets, i.e., the bits that are sent over the wire to the
other side. When encrypting a retransmission packet, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
encrypted like a packet in repair mode (i.e., with only the hop-by-hop key).
</t>
        <t>If the MD were to cache the inner, E2E-encrypted

        <t>When using RED <xref target="RFC2198" format="default"/> with the double transform, the processing at the sender
and receiver is the same as when using RED with any other SRTP
transform.
</t>
        <t>The main difference between the double transform and any other transform is that
in an intermediated environment, usage of RED must be end-to-end.  
An MD cannot synthesize RED packets, because it lacks
access to the plaintext media payloads that are combined to form a
RED payload.
</t>
        <t>Note that Flexible Forward Error Correction (Flex FEC) may often provide similar or better repair
capabilities compared to RED.  For most applications, Flex FEC is a
better choice than RED; in particular, Flex FEC has modes in which
the MD can synthesize recovery packets.

        <t>When using Flex FEC <xref target="RFC8627" format="default"/> with

double-encrypting the packet, then performing FEC.  Processing of
repair packets proceeds in the opposite order, performing FEC
recovery and then decrypting.  This ensures that the original media
is not revealed to the MD but, at the same time, allows
the MD to repair media.  When encrypting a packet
that contains the Flex FEC data, which is already encrypted, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
be encrypted with only the outer, hop-by-hop transform.

      <name>Recommended Inner and Outer Cryptographic Algorithms</name>

      <t>This specification recommends and defines AES-GCM as both the inner
and outer cryptographic algorithms, identified as
DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_128_GCM_AEAD_AES_128_GCM and
DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_256_GCM_AEAD_AES_256_GCM.  These algorithms provide for
authenticated encryption and will consume additional processing time
double-encrypting for hop-by-hop and end-to-end.  However, the
approach is secure and simple; thus, it is  viewed as an acceptable
trade-off in processing efficiency.
</t>
      <t>Note that names for the cryptographic transforms are of the form
DOUBLE_(inner algorithm)_(outer algorithm).
</t>
      <t>While this document only defines a profile based on AES-GCM, it is
possible for future documents to define further profiles with
different inner and outer algorithms in this same framework.  For example,
if a new SRTP transform were defined that encrypts some or all of the
RTP header, it would be reasonable for systems to have the option of
using that for the outer algorithm.  Similarly, if a new transform were
defined that provided only integrity, that would also be reasonable to
use for the outer transform as the payload data is already encrypted by the
inner transform.
</t>
      <t>The AES-GCM cryptographic algorithm introduces an additional 16
octets to the length of the packet.  When using AES-GCM for both the
inner and outer cryptographic algorithms, the total additional
length is 32 octets.  The OHB will consume an additional 1-4 octets.
Packets in repair mode will carry additional repair data, further
increasing their size.
</t>

    <section anchor="sec" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>This SRTP transform provides protection against two classes of
attacker:  a network attacker that knows neither the inner nor outer
keys and a malicious MD that knows the outer key.  Obviously, it
provides no protections against an attacker that holds both the
inner and outer keys.
</t>
      <t>The protections with regard to the network are the same as with the
normal SRTP AES-GCM transforms.  The major difference is that the
double transforms are designed to work better in a group context.
In such contexts, it is important to note that because these
transforms are symmetric, they do not protect against attacks within
the group.  Any member of the group can generate valid SRTP packets
for any SSRC in use by the group.
</t>
      <t>With regard to a malicious MD, the recipient can verify the
integrity of the base header fields and confidentiality and
integrity of the payload.  The recipient has no assurance, however,
of the integrity of the header extensions in the packet.
</t>
      <t>The main innovation of this transform relative to other SRTP
transforms is that it allows a partly trusted MD to decrypt, modify,
and re-encrypt a packet.  When this is done, the cryptographic
contexts used for decryption and re-encryption <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use different,
independent master keys.  If the same context is
used, the nonce formation rules for SRTP will cause the same key and
nonce to be used with two different plaintexts, which substantially
degrades the security of AES-GCM.
</t>
      <t>In other words, from the perspective of the MD, re-encrypting
packets using this protocol will involve the same cryptographic
operations as if it had established independent AES-GCM crypto
contexts with the sender and the receiver. This property allows
the use of an MD that supports AES-GCM but does not modify any
header fields, without requiring any modification to the MD.
