      <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by a
	network to DetNet flows.
        DetNet provides a capability for the delivery of data flows with
        extremely low packet loss rates and bounded end-to-end delivery
        latency.
	General background and concepts of DetNet can be found in the DetNet
	architecture <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"/>.

        <xref target="fig_ip_detnet" format="default"/> illustrates an IP
        DetNet with an MPLS-based DetNet network as a sub-network between the
        relay nodes.  An IP flow is mapped to one or more PWs and MPLS (TE)
        LSPs.  The end systems still originate IP-encapsulated traffic,
        identified as DetNet flows.  The relay nodes follow procedures defined
        in <xref target="ip-over-mpls" format="default"/> to map each DetNet
        flow to MPLS LSPs. While not shown, relay nodes can provide service
        sub-layer functions such as PREOF using DetNet over MPLS, and this is
        indicated by the solid line for the MPLS-facing portion of the Service
        component. Note that the Transit node is MPLS (TE) LSP aware and
        performs switching based on MPLS labels; it need not have any
        specific knowledge of the DetNet service or the corresponding DetNet
        flow identification. See <xref target="ip-over-mpls"
        format="default"/> for details on the mapping of IP flows to MPLS, and
        <xref target="RFC8964" format="default"/> for general support of
        DetNet services using MPLS.

      <t>
        This section defines how IP-encapsulated flows are carried over a
        DetNet MPLS data plane as defined in <xref target="RFC8964"
        format="default"/>.  Since both non-DetNet and DetNet IP packets are
        identical on the wire, this section is applicable to any node that
        supports IP over DetNet MPLS, and this section refers to both cases as
        DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS.

      <section anchor="sec_ip_mpls_dt_dp_scen" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS Data Plane Scenarios</name>
        <t>
          An example use of DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS is presented here.
        </t>
        <t>

          <xref target="fig_ip_detnet" format="default"/> illustrates IP
          DetNet-enabled End Systems (hosts) connected to DetNet-enabled IP
          networks (DN IP), operating over a DetNet-aware MPLS network.  In this
          figure, we have a case where the relay nodes act as T-PEs and sit at
          the boundary of the MPLS domain since the non-MPLS domain is DetNet
          aware.  This case is very similar to the DetNet MPLS Network (Figure
          2 in <xref target="RFC8964" format="default"/>).  However, in Figure
          2 of <xref target="RFC8964" format="default"/>, the T-PEs are
          located at the end system and MPLS spans the whole DetNet service.

          The primary difference in this document is that the relay nodes are
          at the edges of the MPLS domain and therefore function as T-PEs, and
          that MPLS service sub-layer functions are not provided over the
          DetNet IP network.  The transit node functions shown above are
          identical to those described in <xref target="RFC8964"
          format="default"/>.
        </t>


        <t>
          <xref target="fig_ip_pw_detnet" format="default"/> illustrates how
          relay nodes can provide service protection over an MPLS domain.  In
          this case, CE1 and CE2 are IP DetNet end systems that are
          interconnected via an MPLS domain such as that described in <xref
          target="RFC8964" format="default"/>. Note that R1 and R3 sit at the
          edges of an MPLS domain and therefore are similar to T-PEs, while R2
          sits in the middle of the domain and is therefore similar to an
          S-PE.

          <xref target="fig_ip_detnet" format="default"/> illustrates
          DetNet-enabled end systems connected to DetNet-enabled (DN) MPLS
          networks.  A similar situation occurs when end systems are not DetNet
          aware.  In this case, edge nodes sit at the boundary of the MPLS
          domain since it is also a DetNet domain boundary.  The edge nodes
          provide DetNet service proxies for the end applications by
          initiating and terminating DetNet service for the application's IP
          flows.  While the node types differ, there is essentially no
          difference in data plane processing between relays and edges.  There
          are likely to be differences in Controller Plane operation,
          particularly when distributed control plane protocols are used.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is still possible to provide DetNet service protection for
          non-DetNet-aware end systems. This case is basically the
          same as <xref target="fig_ip_pw_detnet" format="default"/>, with the exception
          that CE1 and CE2 are non-DetNet-aware end systems and R1 and R3
          become edge nodes.

        In <xref target="fig_dn_ip_mpls_sn_ex" format="default"/>, "App-flow"
        indicates the payload carried by the DetNet IP data plane.  "IP" and
        "NProto" indicate the fields described in Sections <xref

        section="5.1.1"/> (IP Header Information) and <xref target="RFC8939"
        sectionFormat="bare" section="5.1.2"/> (Other

        format="default"/>, respectively.
        
                "App-flow for MPLS" indicates that an individual DetNet IP
                flow is the payload from the perspective of the DetNet MPLS
                data plane defined in <xref target="RFC8964"
                format="default"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
	    Per <xref target="RFC8964" sectionFormat="of" section="5.1"
	    format="default"/>, the DetNet MPLS data plane uses a single
	    S-Label to support a single App-flow.  DetNet IP Flow
	    Identification Procedures in <xref target="RFC8939"
	    sectionFormat="of" section="5.1" format="default"/> states that a
	    single DetNet flow is identified based on IP- and next-level
	    protocol header information. <xref target="RFC8939"
	    sectionFormat="of" section="4.4" format="default"/> (DetNet Flow
	    Aggregation) defines the ways in which aggregation is supported
	    through the use of prefixes, wildcards, lists, and port ranges.
	    Collectively, this results in the fairly straightforward
	    procedures defined in the next section.
        </t>
        <t>
        As shown in <xref target="fig_ip_pw_detnet" format="default"/>, DetNet relay nodes
        are responsible for the mapping of a DetNet flow, at the service
        sub-layer, from the IP to MPLS DetNet data planes and back
        again. Their related DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS data plane
        operation is comprised of two sets of procedures: the mapping of
        flow identifiers and ensuring proper traffic treatment.
        </t>
        <t>
      Mapping of IP to DetNet MPLS is similar for DetNet IP flows and IP flows.
      The six-tuple of IP is mapped to the S-Label in both cases.
      The various fields may be mapped or ignored when going from IP to MPLS.

        The main differences of mapping IP to DetNet MPLS (compared to plain MPLS) are
		that (1) there is a mandatory flow identification to make the forwarding 
		decision (i.e., forwarding is not based on FEC), (2) the d-CW (DetNet 
		Control Word) is mandatory for the MPLS encapsulation, and 


(3) during forwarding over the DetNet MPLS network, treatment specific to
DetNet flows is needed.

        support DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS at the MPLS ingress node:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">

<li>


 Each MPLS App-Flow is selected from the incoming IP traffic using the IP flow
 identification information defined in <xref target="RFC8939"

            The DetNet MPLS service that is to be used to send the matching IP

	  The S-Label value that identifies the encapsulated App-flow traffic.

        <li>
            For each S-Label, how the received traffic is to be handled. The
            traffic may be processed as any other DetNet IP traffic as defined
            in this document or in <xref target="RFC8939" format="default"/>,
            or the traffic may be directly treated as an MPLS App-flow for
            additional processing according to <xref target="RFC8964"
            format="default"/>.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
        It is the responsibility of the DetNet Controller Plane to
        properly provision both flow identification information and
        the flow-specific resources needed to provide the traffic
        treatment to meet each flow's service requirements.
        This applies for aggregated and individual flows.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
       General security
       considerations for DetNet are described in detail in <xref target="RFC9055" format="default"/>.
       DetNet MPLS and DetNet IP security considerations equally apply to this document and
       are described in <xref target="RFC8964" format="default"/>
       and <xref target="RFC8939" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
       Security aspects that are unique to DetNet are those whose aim is to
       protect the support of specific quality-of-service aspects of DetNet, which are
       primarily to deliver data flows with extremely low packet loss rates
       and bounded end-to-end delivery latency.
      </t>
      <t>
        The primary considerations for the data plane are to maintain
        integrity of data and delivery of the associated DetNet service
        traversing the DetNet network.  Application flows can be protected
        through whatever means is provided by the underlying technology. For
        example, encryption may be used, such as that provided by IPsec <xref
        target="RFC4301" format="default"/> for IP flows and/or by an
        underlying sub-net using MACsec <xref target="IEEE802.1AE-2018"
        format="default"/> for IP-over-Ethernet (Layer 2) flows.
      </t>
      <t>
        From a data plane perspective, this document does not add or modify any
        header information.
      </t>
      <t>
        At the management and control level, DetNet flows are identified on a
        per-flow basis, which may provide Controller Plane attackers with
        additional information about the data flows (when compared to
        Controller Planes that do not include per-flow identification).  This
        is an inherent property of DetNet, which has security implications that
        should be considered when determining if DetNet is a suitable
        technology for any given use case.
      </t>
      <t>
        To provide uninterrupted availability of the DetNet service,
        provisions can be made against DoS attacks and delay attacks. To
        protect against DoS attacks, excess traffic due to malicious or
        malfunctioning devices can be prevented or mitigated, for example,
        through the use of existing mechanisms such as policing and shaping
        applied at the input of a DetNet domain. To prevent DetNet packets
        from being delayed by an entity external to a DetNet domain, DetNet
        technology definitions can allow for the mitigation of
        man-in-the-middle attacks (for example, through use of authentication
        and authorization of devices within the DetNet domain).
