       <t>
	 Well-known issues with multicast have prevented the deployment of
	 multicast in 802.11 <xref target="dot11" format="default"/> and other local-area
	 wireless environments, as described in <xref target="mc-props" format="default"/> and <xref target="mc-prob-stmt" format="default"/>.  Performance issues have been observed
	 when multicast
	 packet transmissions of IETF protocols are used over IEEE 802 wireless
	 media.  Even though enhancements for multicast transmissions have been
	 designed at both IETF and IEEE 802, incompatibilities still exist
	 between specifications, implementations, and configuration choices.
       </t>
       <t> Many IETF protocols depend on multicast/broadcast for delivery of
	 control messages to multiple receivers. Multicast allows data to be sent to 
	 multiple interested recipients without the source needing to send duplicate
	 data to each recipient. With broadcast traffic, data is sent to every device 
	 regardless of their expressed interest in the data. Multicast is used for various
	 purposes such as Neighbor Discovery, network flooding, and address
	 resolution, as well as minimizing media occupancy for the
	 transmission of data that is intended for multiple receivers.
	 In addition to protocol use of broadcast/multicast for
	 control messages, more applications, such as Push To Talk in
	 hospitals or video in enterprises, universities, and homes, are
	 sending multicast IP to end-user devices, which are increasingly
	 using Wi-Fi for their connectivity. </t>
       <t> IETF protocols typically rely on network protocol layering in order
	 to reduce or eliminate any dependence of higher-level protocols on
	 the specific nature of the MAC-layer protocols or the physical media.
	 In the case of multicast transmissions, higher-level protocols have
	 traditionally been designed as if transmitting a packet to an IP
	 address had the same cost in interference and network media access,
	 regardless of whether the destination IP address is a unicast address
	 or a multicast or broadcast address. This model was reasonable for
	 networks where the physical medium was wired, like Ethernet.
	 Unfortunately, for many wireless media, the costs to access the
	 medium can be quite different.  Multicast over Wi-Fi has often been
	 plagued by such poor performance that it is disallowed.
	 Some enhancements have been designed
	 in IETF protocols that are assumed to work primarily over wireless
	 media.  However, these enhancements are usually implemented in limited
	 deployments and are not widespread on most wireless networks.</t>
       <t> IEEE 802 wireless protocols have been designed with certain features
	 to support multicast traffic. For instance, lower modulations are
	 used to transmit multicast frames so that these can be received by
	 all stations in the cell, regardless of the distance or path
	 attenuation from the base station or Access Point (AP).  

 However, these
	 lower modulation transmissions occupy the medium longer;
	 they hamper efficient transmission of traffic using
	 higher-order modulations to nearby stations.
	 For these and other reasons, IEEE 802 Working Groups such as 802.11
	 have designed features to improve the performance of multicast
	 transmissions at Layer 2 <xref target="ietf_802-11" format="default"/>.
	 In addition to protocol design features, certain operational and
	 configuration enhancements can ameliorate the network
	 performance issues created by multicast traffic,
	 as described in <xref target="optim3" format="default"/>.</t>
       <t> There seems to be general agreement that these problems will not
	 be fixed anytime soon, primarily because it's expensive to do so
	 and because of the unreliability of multicast.  Compared to unicast over Wi-Fi,
	 multicast is often treated as somewhat of a second-class citizen even
	 though there are many protocols using multicast.  Something needs to
	 be provided in order to make them more reliable.  IPv6
	 Neighbor Discovery saturating the Wi-Fi link is only part of the
	 problem.  Wi-Fi traffic classes may help.  This document is intended
	 to help make the determination about
	 what problems should be solved by the IETF and what problems
	 should be solved by the IEEE (see <xref target="discussion" format="default"/>).
       </t>
       <t> This document details various problems caused by multicast transmission
	 over wireless networks, including high packet error rates, no
	 acknowledgements, and low data rate.  It also explains some
	 enhancements that have been designed at the IETF and IEEE 802.11 to ameliorate
	 the effects of the radio medium on multicast traffic.  Recommendations are also provided
	 to implementors about how to use and combine these enhancements.
	 Some advice about the operational choices that can be made is also
	 included.  It is likely that this document will also be considered
	 relevant to designers of future IEEE wireless specifications. </t>

      <name>Identified Multicast Issues</name>
      <section anchor="l2_issues" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Issues at Layer 2 and Below</name>
        <t> In this section, some of the issues related to the use of multicast
	   transmissions over IEEE 802 wireless technologies are described.</t>
        <section anchor="reliability" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Multicast Reliability</name>
          <t> Multicast traffic is typically much less reliable than unicast
	    traffic. Since multicast makes point-to-multipoint communications,
	    multiple acknowledgements would be needed to guarantee reception
	    at all recipients. However, since there are no ACKs for multicast
	    packets, it is not possible for the AP to
	    know whether or not a retransmission is needed.  Even in the wired
	    Internet, this characteristic often causes undesirably high error
	    rates.  This has contributed to the relatively slow uptake of
	    multicast applications even though the protocols have long been
	    available.  The situation for wireless links is much worse and is
	    quite sensitive to the presence of background traffic.
	    Consequently, there can be a high packet error rate (PER)
	    due to lack of retransmission and because the sender never backs
	    off.  PER is the ratio, in percent, of the number of packets not successfully 
	    received by the device. It is not uncommon for there to be a packet loss rate of 5%
	    or more, which is particularly troublesome for video and other
	    environments where high data rates and high reliability are
	    required.  </t>
        </section>


    <section anchor="lower_rate" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Lower and Variable Data Rate</name>
          <t> Multicast over wired differs from multicast over wireless because
	    transmission over wired links often occurs at
	    a fixed rate.  Wi-Fi, on the other hand, has a transmission rate
	    that varies depending upon the STA's proximity to the AP.
	    The throughput of video flows and the capacity of the broader
	    Wi-Fi network will change with device movement. This impacts the ability for QoS
	    solutions to effectively reserve bandwidth and provide admission
	    control. </t>
          <t> For wireless stations authenticated and linked with an AP, the power
	    necessary for good reception can vary from station to station.  For
	    unicast, the goal is to minimize power requirements while maximizing
	    the data rate to the destination.  For multicast, the goal is simply
	    to maximize the number of receivers that will correctly receive the
	    multicast packet; generally, the AP has
	    to use a much lower data rate at a power level high enough for even
	    the farthest station to receive the packet, for example, as briefly


	    mentioned in <xref target="RFC5757" sectionFormat="of" section="4"/>.  Consequently, the data
	    rate of a video stream, for instance, would be constrained by the
	    environmental considerations of the least-reliable receiver
	    associated with the AP. </t>

          <t> Because more robust modulation and coding schemes (MCSs)
	    have a longer range but also a lower data rate, multicast/broadcast
	    traffic is generally transmitted at the slowest rate of all the
	    connected devices. This is also known as the basic rate.
	    The amount of additional interference depends on the
	    specific wireless technology.  In fact, backward compatibility and
	    multi-stream implementations mean that the maximum unicast rates
	    are currently up to a few Gbps, so there can be more than
	    3 orders of magnitude difference in the transmission rate between
	    multicast/broadcast versus optimal unicast forwarding.  Some
	    techniques employed to increase spectral efficiency, such as spatial
	    multiplexing in Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems, are not available with more than
	    one intended receiver; it is not the case that backwards
	    compatibility is the only factor responsible for lower multicast
	    transmission rates. </t>
          <t> Wired multicast also affects wireless LANs when the AP extends
	    the wired segment; in that case, multicast/broadcast frames
	    on the wired LAN side are copied to the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).  Since broadcast
	    messages are transmitted at the most robust MCS,
	    many large frames are sent at a slow rate over the air. </t>
        </section>


    <section anchor="interference" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Capacity and Impact on Interference</name>
          <t> Transmissions at a lower
	    rate require longer occupancy of the wireless medium and thus
	    take away from the airtime of other communications and
	    degrade the overall capacity.  Furthermore, transmission at higher
	    power, as is required to reach all multicast STAs associated
	    with the AP, proportionately increases the area of interference with other 
	    consumers of the radio spectrum. </t>
        </section>

    <section anchor="power_save" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Power-Save Effects on Multicast</name>
          <t> One of the characteristics of multicast transmission over Wi-Fi is that every
	    station has to be configured to wake up to receive the multicast frame,
	    even though the received packet may ultimately be discarded.  This
	    process can have a large effect on the power consumption by
	    the multicast receiver station. For this reason, there are workarounds,
	    such as Directed Multicast Service (DMS) described in <xref target="optim2"/>, to
	    prevent unnecessarily waking up stations.</t>
          <t> Multicast (and unicast) can work poorly with the power-save mechanisms defined in
	    IEEE 802.11e for the following reasons.
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li> Clients may be unable to stay in sleep mode due to
		multicast control packets frequently waking them up.</li>


            <li> A unicast packet is delayed until an STA wakes up and requests
		it.  Unicast traffic may also be delayed to improve power
		save and efficiency and to increase the probability of aggregation.</li>
            <li> Multicast traffic is delayed in a wireless network if any of
		the STAs in that network are power savers.
		All STAs associated with the AP have to be
		awake at a known time to receive multicast traffic.</li>
            <li> Packets can also be discarded due to buffer limitations in
		the AP and non-AP STA.</li>
          </ul>

  <section anchor="l3_issues" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Issues at Layer 3 and Above</name>
        <t> This section identifies some representative IETF protocols and
	  describes possible negative effects due to performance degradation
	  when using multicast transmissions for control messages.
	  Common uses of multicast include:
        </t>
        <ul>
          <li> Control plane signaling </li>
          <li> Neighbor Discovery </li>
          <li> Address resolution </li>
          <li> Service Discovery </li>
          <li> Applications (video delivery, stock data, etc.) </li>
          <li> On-demand routing </li>
          <li> Backbone construction </li>
          <li> Other Layer 3 protocols (non-IP) </li>
	  </ul>
        <t>
	User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is the most common transport-layer
	protocol for multicast applications.
	By itself, UDP is not reliable -- messages may be lost or
	delivered out of order.
        </t>
        <section anchor="IPv4" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>IPv4 Issues</name>
          <t> The following list contains some representative
	    discovery protocols that utilize broadcast/multicast and are used with IPv4.
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li>ARP <xref target="RFC0826" format="default"/></li>

          </ul>
          <t> After initial configuration, ARP (described in more detail later), DHCP, and uPnP occur much less
	    commonly, but service discovery can occur at any time.  Some
	    widely deployed service discovery protocols (e.g., for finding a
	    printer) utilize mDNS (i.e., multicast), which is often dropped by operators.  Even if multicast 
	    snooping <xref target="RFC4541" format="default"/> (which provides the benefit of conserving 
	    bandwidth on those segments of the network where no node has expressed interest in receiving 
	    packets addressed to the group address) is utilized, many devices can register at once and cause serious
	    network degradation.</t>
        </section>


      <section anchor="IPv6" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>IPv6 Issues</name>
          <t> IPv6 makes extensive use of multicast, including the following:
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li> DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415" format="default"/></li>
            <li> Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) <xref target="RFC7761" format="default"/></li>
            <li> IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/></li>
            <li> Multicast DNS (mDNS) <xref target="RFC6762" format="default"/></li>
            <li> Router Discovery <xref target="RFC4286" format="default"/></li>
          </ul>
          <t> IPv6 NDP Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages used in Duplicate Address 
	    Detection (DAD) and address lookup make use of link-scope multicast.  In
	    contrast to IPv4, an IPv6 node will typically use multiple
	    addresses and may change them often for privacy reasons.  This
	    intensifies the impact of multicast messages that are associated
	    with the mobility of a node.  Router advertisement (RA) messages
	    are also periodically multicast over the link.
          </t>
          <t> Neighbors may be considered lost if several consecutive
	    Neighbor Discovery packets fail.
          </t>
        </section>


	<section anchor="mld" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>MLD Issues</name>
          <t> Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) <xref target="RFC4541" format="default"/> is
	    used to identify members of a multicast group that are connected to
	    the ports of a switch.  Forwarding multicast frames into a
	    Wi-Fi-enabled area can use switch support for hardware
	    forwarding state information. However, since IPv6 makes heavy use
	    of multicast, each STA with an IPv6 address will require state on
	    the switch for several and possibly many solicited-node multicast
	    addresses. A solicited-node multicast address is an IPv6 multicast 
	    address used by NDP to verify whether an IPv6 address is already 
	    used by the local link. Multicast addresses that do not have forwarding state
	    installed (perhaps due to hardware memory limitations on the
	    switch) cause frames to be flooded on all ports of the switch. Some 
	    switch vendors do not support MLD for link-scope multicast due to
	    the increase it can cause in state. </t>
        </section>


      <section anchor="spurious" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Spurious Neighbor Discovery</name>
          <t> On the Internet, there is a "background radiation" of scanning
	    traffic (people scanning for vulnerable machines) and backscatter
	    (responses from spoofed traffic, etc.). This means that routers
	    very often receive packets destined for IPv4 addresses regardless of
	    whether those IP addresses are in use. In the cases where the IP
	    is assigned to a host, the router broadcasts an ARP request, receives an ARP
	    reply, and caches it; then, traffic can be delivered to the host.
	    When the IP address is not in use, the router broadcasts one (or
	    more) ARP requests and never gets a reply. This means that it does
	    not populate the ARP cache, and the next time there is traffic for
	    that IP address, the router will rebroadcast the ARP requests.
          </t>
          <t> The rate of these ARP requests is proportional to the size of the
	    subnets, the rate of scanning and backscatter, and how long the
	    router keeps state on non-responding ARPs. As it turns out, this
	    rate is inversely proportional to how occupied the subnet is
	    (valid ARPs end up in a cache, stopping the broadcasting; unused
	    IPs never respond, and so cause more broadcasts).  Depending on
	    the address space in use, the time of day, how occupied the
	    subnet is, and other unknown factors, thousands of broadcasts per second 
	    have been observed. Around 2,000 broadcasts per second have been observed at
	    the IETF NOC during face-to-face meetings. </t>
          <t> With Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/>, nodes 
      accomplish address resolution by multicasting a Neighbor Solicitation 
      that asks the target node to return its link-layer address.  Neighbor 
      Solicitation messages are multicast to the solicited-node multicast 
      address of the target address.  The target returns its link-layer address 
      in a unicast Neighbor Advertisement message.  A single request-response 
      pair of packets is sufficient for both the initiator and the target to resolve 
      each other's link-layer addresses; the initiator includes its link-layer 
      address in the Neighbor Solicitation.</t>
          <t> On a wired network, there is not a huge difference between unicast,
	    multicast, and broadcast traffic.  Due to hardware filtering
	    (see, e.g., <xref target="Deri-2010" format="default"/>), inadvertently flooded
	    traffic (or excessive Ethernet multicast) on wired networks
	    can be quite a bit less costly compared to wireless cases where sleeping 
	    devices have to wake up to process packets.  Wired Ethernets tend to be switched
	    networks, further reducing interference from multicast.  There is
	    effectively no collision / scheduling problem except at extremely

        <t> Methods have been developed to help save battery life; for example,

	The AP acts on behalf of STAs in various ways.  To enable use of

	for delivery to the STA at the time when the STA is scheduled for
	reception.  If an AP, for instance, expresses a Delivery Traffic
	Indication Message (DTIM) of 3, then
	the AP will send a multicast packet every 3 packets.  In fact,
	when any single wireless STA associated with an AP has
	802.11 power-save mode enabled, the AP buffers all multicast
	frames and sends them only after the next DTIM beacon.  </t>
        <t> In practice, most APs will send a multicast every 30 packets.
	For unicast, the AP could send a Traffic Indication Message (TIM),
	but, for multicast, the AP sends a broadcast to everyone.  DTIM does
	power management, but STAs can choose whether to wake up

          <t>
	   In many situations, it's a good choice to use unicast instead of
	   multicast over the Wi-Fi link.  This avoids most of the
	   problems specific to multicast over Wi-Fi, since the individual
	   frames are then acknowledged and buffered for power-save clients
	   in the way that unicast traffic normally operates.
          </t>
          <t>
	   This approach comes with the trade-off of sometimes sending
	   the same packet multiple times over the Wi-Fi link.  However,
	   in many cases, such as video into a residential home network,
	   this can be a good trade-off since the Wi-Fi link may have enough
	   capacity for the unicast traffic to be transmitted to each
	   subscribed STA, even though multicast addressing may have been
	   necessary for the upstream access network.
          </t>
          <t>

        <t> For the block acknowledgement mechanism, the AP transmits each

	Retransmissions are group addressed but hidden from non-11aa STAs.

	status from receivers; retransmissions are based upon these

        <t> GCR is suitable for all group sizes including medium to large

	block acknowledgement requests to only a small subset of the group.
	GCR does require changes to both AP and STA implementations.</t>
        <t> GCR may introduce unacceptable latency. After sending a group of
	data frames to the group, the AP has to do the following:

          <dd>
            <t> An ARP Sponge
	    sits on a network and learns which IP addresses are actually in
	    use. It also listens for ARP requests, and, if it sees an ARP for
	    an IP address that it believes is not used, it will reply with
	    its own MAC address. This means that the router now has an IP-to-MAC mapping, which it caches. If that IP is later assigned to a
	    machine (e.g., using DHCP), the ARP Sponge will see this and will
	    stop replying for that address. Gratuitous ARPs (or the machine
	    ARPing for its gateway) will replace the sponged address in the
	    router ARP table. This technique is quite effective; unfortunately, the ARP Sponge daemons were not really designed for
	    this use (one of the most widely deployed ARP Sponges
	    <xref target="arpsponge" format="default"/> was
	    designed to deal with the disappearance of participants from an
	    Internet Exchange Point (IXP)) and so are not optimized for this purpose.  

One daemon is
	    needed per subnet; the tuning is tricky (the scanning rate versus
	    the population rate versus retries, etc.), and sometimes daemons just stop, 
	    requiring a restart of the daemon that causes disruption. </t>
             
          </dd>
          <dt>Router mitigations</dt>
          <dd>
            <t> Some
	    routers (often those based on Linux) implement a "negative ARP
	    cache" daemon. If the router does not see a reply to
	    an ARP, it can be configured to cache this information for some
	    interval. Unfortunately, the core routers in use often do
	    not support this. Instead, when a host connects to a network and gets an IP
	    address, it will ARP for its default gateway (the router). The
	    router will update its cache with the IP to host MAC mapping
	    learned from the request (passive ARP learning). </t>
             
          </dd>
          <dt>Firewall unused space</dt>
          <dd>
            <t> The
	    distribution of users on wireless networks / subnets may change in various
	    use cases, such as conference venues (e.g., Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) are renamed, some SSIDs
	    lose favor, etc.).  This makes utilization for particular SSIDs
	    difficult to predict ahead of time, but usage can be monitored
	    as attendees use the different networks. Configuring multiple
	    DHCP pools per subnet and enabling them sequentially can create
	    a large subnet from which only addresses in the lower portions
	    are assigned. Therefore, input IP access lists can be applied,
	    which deny traffic to the upper, unused portions. Then the
	    router does not attempt to forward packets to the unused portions
	    of the subnets and so does not ARP for it. This method has proven
	    to be very effective but is somewhat of a blunt axe, is fairly
	    labor intensive, and requires coordination. </t>
             
          </dd>
          <dt>Disabling/Filtering ARP requests</dt>
          <dd>
            <t> In general, the router does not need to ARP for
	    hosts; when a host connects, the router can learn the IP-to-MAC
	    mapping from the ARP request sent by that host.  Consequently, it
	    should be possible to disable and/or filter ARP requests from the
	    router.  Unfortunately, ARP is a very low-level/fundamental part
	    of the IP stack and is often offloaded from the normal control
	    plane. While many routers can filter Layer 2 traffic, this is
	    usually implemented as an input filter and/or has limited
	    ability to filter output broadcast traffic. 

This means that the seemingly simple and obvious solution to "just disable ARP or filter it outbound" is made difficult or awkward in practice by implementations and/or architectural issues.

          <dd>
            <t> Broadcasts can often be 
	    caused by outside Wi-Fi scanning / backscatter traffic. In order to reduce the impact of
	    broadcasts, NAT can be used on the entire (or a large portion) of a network. This would
	    eliminate NAT translation entries for unused addresses, and the router would never ARP 
	    for them. There are, however, many reasons to avoid using NAT in such a blanket fashion.

	    But this conflicts with the need and desire of some
	    organizations to have the network as open as possible and to
	    honor the end-to-end principle. An attendee on a meeting network
	    should be an Internet host and should be able to receive
	    unsolicited requests. Unfortunately, keeping the network working
	    and stable is the first priority, and a stateful firewall may be
	    required in order to achieve this.</dd>

	is oriented towards minimality, with the result that many such
	functions are relegated to operation within higher-layer protocols.
	This leads to a patchwork of non-interoperable and vendor-specific
	solutions.  See <xref target="uli" format="default"/> for additional discussion
	and a proposal for a task group to resolve similar issues, in which
	the multicast problems might be considered for mitigation. </t>
      <t> Similar considerations hold for most other wireless media.  A brief
	introduction is provided in <xref target="RFC5757" format="default"/> for the following:
      </t>
      <ul>
        <li> 802.16 WiMAX </li>
        <li> 3GPP/3GPP2 </li>
        <li> DVB-H/DVB-IPDC </li>
        <li> TV Broadcast and Satellite Networks </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
   <section anchor="recommendations" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Recommendations</name>
      <t>	This section provides some recommendations about the usage and
	combinations of some of the multicast enhancements described in Sections
	<xref target="optim2" format="counter"/> and <xref target="optim3" format="counter"/>.</t>
      <t> Future protocol documents utilizing multicast signaling should
	be carefully scrutinized if the protocol is likely to be used over
	wireless media. </t>
      <t> The use of proxy methods should be encouraged to conserve network bandwidth
	and power utilization by low-power devices.  

The device can send a unicast message to its proxy, and then the proxy can take care
	of any needed multicast operations.  </t>
      <t> Multicast signaling for wireless devices should be done in a way that is
	compatible with low duty-cycle operation. </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="discussion" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Ongoing Discussion Items</name>
      <t>	This section suggests two discussion items for further resolution. </t>
      <t> First, standards (and private) organizations should develop guidelines to help clarify when
	multicast packets would be better served by being sent wired rather than wireless.  
For example, 802.1ak <xref target="IEEE802.1ak"/> works on
	both Ethernet and Wi-Fi, and organizations could help with deployment decision making
	by developing guidelines for multicast over Wi-Fi, including options for when traffic should be sent wired.
      </t>


      <t>
	Second, reliable registration to Layer 2 multicast groups and a reliable
	multicast operation at Layer 2 might provide a good multicast over Wi-Fi solution.
	There shouldn't be a need to support 2<sup>24</sup> groups to get solicited node
	multicast working: it is possible to simply select a number of
	bits that make sense for a given network size to limit the
	number of unwanted deliveries to reasonable levels.  
The IEEE 802.1,
	802.11, and 802.15 Working Groups should be encouraged to revisit Layer 2 multicast issues and provide
	workable solutions.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="sec" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
	This document does not introduce or modify any security mechanisms. 
	Multicast deployed on wired or wireless networks as discussed in this document can be 
	made more secure in a variety of ways. 
<xref target="RFC4601" format="default"/>, for instance,
  specifies the use of IPsec to ensure authentication of the link-local messages 
  in the Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) routing protocol.  
  <xref target="RFC5796" format="default"/> specifies mechanisms to authenticate the PIM-SM link-local messages 
  using the IP security (IPsec) Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) or (optionally) the
   Authentication Header (AH).
      </t>
      <t>When using mechanisms that convert multicast traffic to unicast traffic for traversing radio links, 
    the AP (or other entity) is forced to explicitly track which subscribers care about certain multicast traffic.  
    This is generally a reasonable trade-off but does result in another entity that is tracking what entities 
    subscribe to which multicast traffic.  While such information is already (by necessity) tracked elsewhere, 
    this does present an expansion of the attack surface for that potentially privacy-sensitive information.</t>
      <t>
	As noted in <xref target="group_key" format="default"/>, the unreliable nature of
	multicast transmission over wireless media can cause subtle problems
	with multicast group key management and updates. 

<xref target="group_key"/> states that when TKIP (WPA, now deprecated) or AES-CCMP (WPA2/WPA3) encryption is in use, AP-to-client (FromDS) multicasts have to be encrypted with a separate encryption key that 
	is known to all of the clients (this is called the Group Key). Quoting further from that
	website, "... most clients are able to get connected and surf the web,
	check email, etc. even when FromDS multicasts are broken. So a lot of
	people don't realize they have multicast problems on their network..."
      </t>
      <t>This document encourages the use of proxy methods to conserve network bandwidth and
        power utilization by low-power devices. Such proxy methods in general have security considerations that 
        require the proxy to be trusted to not misbehave. One such proxy method listed is an ARP Sponge that listens for ARP requests, and, if it sees an ARP for an IP address that it believes is not used, it will reply 
        with its own MAC address. ARP poisoning and false advertising could potentially undermine (e.g., DoS) 
        this and other proxy approaches.</t>
