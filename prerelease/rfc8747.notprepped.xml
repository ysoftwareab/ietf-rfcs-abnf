      <t>
	By including a <tt>cnf</tt> (confirmation) claim in a CWT,
	the issuer of the CWT declares that the presenter possesses a particular key
	and that the recipient can cryptographically confirm that
	the presenter has possession of that key.
	The value of the <tt>cnf</tt> claim is a CBOR map
	(which is defined in <xref target="RFC7049"
	sectionFormat="of" section="2.1"/>)
	and the members of that map identify the proof-of-possession key.
      </t>
      <t>
	The presenter can be identified in one of several ways by the CWT,
	depending upon the application requirements.
	For instance, some applications may use
	the CWT <tt>sub</tt> (subject) claim <xref target="RFC8392" format="default"/>
	to identify the presenter.
	Other applications may use
	the <tt>iss</tt> (issuer) claim <xref target="RFC8392" format="default"/>
	to identify the presenter.
	In some applications, the subject identifier might be relative to
	the issuer identified by the <tt>iss</tt> claim.
	The actual mechanism used is dependent upon the application.
	The case in which the presenter is the subject of the CWT is analogous to
	Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 <xref
	target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os" format="default"/> SubjectConfirmation
	usage. 
      </t>
      <section anchor="Confirmation" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Confirmation Claim</name>
        <t>
  The <tt>cnf</tt> claim in the CWT is used to carry confirmation methods. Some of
 them use proof-of-possession keys, while others do not. This design is
 analogous to the SAML 2.0 <xref target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os" format="default"/> SubjectConfirmation
 element in which a number of different subject confirmation methods can
 be included (including proof-of-possession key information).
</t>
        <t>
	  The set of confirmation members that a
	  CWT must contain to be considered valid is context dependent
	  and is outside the scope of this specification.
	  Specific applications of CWTs will require implementations
	  to understand and process some confirmation members in particular ways.
	  However, in the absence of such requirements, all confirmation members
	  that are not understood by implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored.
        </t>
        <t>
	 <xref target="CnfReg" format="default"/>  establishes the
	  IANA "CWT Confirmation Methods" registry for CWT <tt>cnf</tt>
	  member values and registers the members defined by this specification.
	  Other specifications can register
	  other members used for confirmation, including other members for
	  conveying proof-of-possession keys using different key
	  representations.
        </t>
        <t>

		present. Note that if an application 
		needs to represent multiple proof-of-possession keys in the same CWT, one way
		for it to achieve this is to use other claim names (in addition to
		<tt>cnf</tt>) to hold the additional proof-of-possession
		key information. These claims could use the same syntax and semantics as the
		<tt>cnf</tt> claim. Those claims would be defined by
		applications or other specifications and could be registered in the

	  The proof-of-possession key can also be identified using

	  Note that the use of a Key ID to identify a proof-of-possession key
	  needs to be carefully circumscribed, 
	  as described below and in <xref target="Operational" format="default"/>.
	  In cases where the Key ID is not a cryptographic value derived from the key
	  or where not all of the parties involved are validating the cryptographic derivation,
	  implementers should expect collisions where different keys are assigned the same Key ID.

	  In the world of constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices,

        <t>Note that the value of a Key ID for a specific key is not

        <t>
	  Proof of possession is often demonstrated by having the presenter sign
	  a value determined by the recipient using the key possessed by the presenter.
	  This value is sometimes called a "nonce" or a "challenge".
          There are, however, also other means to demonstrate freshness of the exchange
	  and to link the proof-of-possession key to the participating parties,
	  as demonstrated by various authentication and key exchange protocols.
        </t>
        <t>
	  The means of communicating the nonce and the nature of its contents
	  are intentionally not described in this specification,
	  as different protocols will communicate this information in different ways.
	  Likewise, the means of communicating the signed nonce is also not specified,
	  as this is also protocol specific.
        </t>
        <t>
	  Note that other means of proving possession of the key
	  exist, which could be used in conjunction with a CWT's confirmation key.
	  Applications making use of such alternate means are encouraged
	  to register them in the IANA "CBOR Web Token (CWT) Confirmation Methods" registry
	  established in <xref target="CnfReg" format="default"/>.

      <t>
        All the security considerations that
        are discussed in <xref target="RFC8392" format="default"/> also apply here.
        In addition, proof of possession introduces its own unique security issues.
	Possessing a key is only valuable if it is kept secret.
	Appropriate means must be used to ensure that unintended parties
	do not learn private key or symmetric key values.
      </t>
      <t>
	Applications utilizing proof of possession <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also utilize audience restriction,
	as described in <xref target="RFC8392"
	sectionFormat="of" section="3.1.3"/>,
	because it provides additional protections.
	Audience restriction can be used by recipients to reject messages intended for different recipients.
	(Of course, applications not using proof of possession can also benefit
	from using audience restriction to reject messages intended for different recipients.)
      </t>
      <t>
	CBOR Web Tokens with proof-of-possession keys are used in context of an architecture,
	such as the ACE OAuth Framework <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" format="default"/>,
	in which protocols are used by a presenter to request these tokens
	and to subsequently use them with recipients.
	Proof of possession only provides the intended security gains when the
	proof is known to be current and not subject to replay attacks;
	security protocols using mechanisms such as nonces and timestamps can be used to
	avoid the risk of replay when performing proof of possession for a
	token.

	Note that a discussion of the architecture or specific protocols that
	CWTs with proof-of-possession keys are used with is beyond the scope of this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
	As is the case with other information included in a CWT,
	it is necessary to apply data origin authentication and integrity protection
	(via a keyed message digest or a digital signature).
	Data origin authentication ensures that the recipient of the CWT
	learns about the entity that created the CWT,
	since this will be important for any policy decisions.
	Integrity protection prevents an adversary from changing
	any elements conveyed within the CWT payload.
	Special care has to be applied when carrying symmetric keys inside the CWT
	since those not only require integrity protection
	but also confidentiality protection.
      </t>
      <t>
	As described in Section <xref target="RFC7515" section="6" sectionFormat="bare">Key
	Identification</xref> and Appendix <xref target="RFC7515" section="D"
	sectionFormat="bare">Notes on Key Selection</xref> of <xref
	target="RFC7515"/>, it is important to make 
	explicit trust decisions about the keys. 
	Proof-of-possession signatures made with keys
	not meeting the application's trust criteria <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be relied upon.

	A proof-of-possession key can be used as a correlation handle if the same key

      <t>
	The use of CWTs with proof-of-possession keys requires additional information
	to be shared between the involved parties in order to ensure correct processing.
	The recipient needs to be able to use credentials to verify the authenticity and
	integrity of the CWT. Furthermore, the recipient may need to be able to decrypt
	either the whole CWT or the encrypted parts thereof (see <xref target="SymmetricPoP" format="default"/>).
	This requires the recipient to know information about the issuer.
	Likewise, there needs to be agreement between the issuer and the recipient
	about the claims being used (which is also true of CWTs in general).
      </t>
      <t>
	When an issuer creates a CWT containing a Key ID claim, it needs to make sure that
	it does not issue another CWT with different claims containing the same Key ID
	within the lifetime of the CWTs, unless intentionally desired.
	Failure to do so may allow one party to impersonate another party,
	with the potential to gain additional privileges.
	A case where such reuse of a Key ID would be intentional is when a presenter obtains
	a CWT with different claims (e.g., extended scope) for the same recipient but wants to
	continue using an existing security association (e.g., a DTLS session) bound to the key
	identified by the Key ID.
	Likewise, if PoP keys are used for multiple different kinds of CWTs in an application
	and the PoP keys are identified by Key IDs, care must be taken to keep the keys
	for the different kinds of CWTs segregated so that an attacker cannot
	cause the wrong PoP key to be used by using a valid Key ID
	for the wrong kind of CWT.
	Using an audience restriction for the CWT would be one strategy to mitigate this risk.

      <t>
	The following registration procedure is used for all the
	registries established by this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
	Values are registered on a Specification Required
	<xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/> basis after a three-week review period on the &lt;cwt-reg-review@ietf.org&gt; mailing
	list, on the advice of one or more designated experts. However, to allow for the
	allocation of values prior to publication, the designated experts may approve
	registration once they are satisfied that such a specification will be published.
      </t>
      <t>
	Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
	an appropriate subject
	(e.g., "Request to Register CWT Confirmation Method: example").
	Registration requests that are undetermined for
	a period longer than 21 days can be brought directly to IANA's attention
	(using the iana@iana.org mailing list) for resolution.
      </t>
      <t>
	Designated experts should determine whether a registration request contains
	enough information for the registry to be populated with the new values and
	whether the proposed new functionality already exists.
	In the case of an incomplete registration
	or an attempt to register already existing functionality,
	the designated experts should ask for corrections or reject the registration.
      </t>
      <t>
	It is suggested that multiple designated experts be appointed who are able to
	represent the perspectives of different applications using this specification
	in order to enable broadly informed review of registration decisions.
	In cases where a registration decision could be perceived as
	creating a conflict of interest for a particular expert,
	that expert should defer to the judgment of the other experts.
