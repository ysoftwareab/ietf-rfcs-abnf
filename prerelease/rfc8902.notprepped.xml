      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The TLS protocol <xref target="RFC8446"/> allows the use of X.509
      certificates and raw public keys to authenticate servers and
      clients. This document describes an experimental extension following the
      procedures laid out by <xref target="RFC7250"/> to support use of the certificate
      format specified by the IEEE in <xref target="IEEE1609.2"/> and profiled by the
      European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in <xref
      target="TS103097"/>. These standards specify secure communications in
      vehicular environments. These certificates are referred to in this
      document as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Certificates.</t>
      <t>The certificate types are optimized for bandwidth and processing time
      to support delay-sensitive applications and also to provide both
      authentication and authorization information to enable fast access
      control decisions in ad hoc networks found in Intelligent
      Transport Systems (ITS). The standards specify different types of
      certificates to support a full Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
      specification; the certificates to be used in this context are
      end-entity certificates, i.e., certificates that have the IEEE 1609.2
      appPermissions field present.</t>

      <t>Use of ITS certificates is becoming widespread in the ITS
      setting. ITS communications, in practice, make heavy use of 10 MHz
      channels with a typical throughput of 6 Mbps. (The 802.11OCB modulation
      that gives this throughput is not the one that gives the highest
      throughput, but it provides for a robust signal over a range up to
      300-500 m, which is the "sweet spot" communications range for ITS
      operations like collision avoidance). The compact nature of ITS
      certificates as opposed to X.509 certificates makes them appropriate for
      this setting. </t>
      <t>The ITS certificates are also suited to the machine-to-machine (M2M)
      ad hoc network setting because their direct encoding of permissions (see
      <xref target="ITS-permissions"/>) allows a receiver to make an immediate
      accept/deny decision about an incoming message without having to refer
      to a remote identity and access management server. The EU has committed
      to the use of ITS certificates in Cooperative Intelligent Transport
      Systems deployments. A multi-year project developed a certificate policy
      for the use of ITS certificates, including a specification of how
      different root certificates can be trusted across the system (hosted at
      &lt;<eref
      target="https://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en"/>&gt;,
      direct link at &lt;<eref
      target="https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/c-its_certificate_policy_release_1.pdf"/>&gt;).</t>


      <t> The EU has committed funding for the first five years of operation
      of the top-level Trust List Manager entity, enabling organizations such
      as motor vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and national
      road authorities to create root certificate authorities (CAs) and have
      them trusted. In the US, the US Department of Transportation (USDOT)
      published a proposed regulation, active as of late 2019 though not
      rapidly progressing, requiring all light vehicles in the US to implement
      vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, including the use of ITS
      certificates (available at &lt;<eref
      target="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/12/2016-31059/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards-v2v-communications"/>&gt;). As
      of 2019, ITS deployments across the US, Europe, and Australia were using
      ITS certificates. Volkswagen has committed to deploying V2X using ITS
      certificates. New York, Tampa, and Wyoming are deploying traffic
      management systems using ITS certificates. GM deployed V2X in the
      Cadillac CTS, using ITS certificates.</t>
      <t> ITS certificates are also used in a number of standards that build
      on top of the foundational IEEE and ETSI standards, particularly the
      Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) J2945/x series of standards for
      applications and ISO 21177 <xref target="ISO21177"/>, which builds a framework for exchanging
      multiple authentication tokens on top of the TLS variant specified in
      this document.

        <name>Experiment Overview</name>

        <t>This document describes an experimental extension to the TLS
        security model. It uses a form of certificate that has not previously
        been used in the Internet.  Systems using this Experimental approach
        are segregated from systems using standard TLS by the use of a new
        certificate type value, reserved through IANA (see <xref
        target="IANA"/>).  An implementation of TLS that is not involved in
        the Experiment will not recognize this new certificate type and will
        not participate in the experiment; TLS sessions will either negotiate
        the use of existing X.509 certificates or fail to be established. </t>
        <t>This extension has been encouraged by stakeholders in the
        Cooperative ITS community in order to support ITS use-case
        deployment, and it is anticipated that its use will be widespread. </t>

      <name>Extension Overview</name>
      <t> The TLS extensions "client_certificate_type" and
      "server_certificate_type" <xref target="RFC7250"/> are used to negotiate
      the type of Certificate messages used in TLS to authenticate the server
      and, optionally, the client. Using separate extensions allows for mixed
      deployments where the client and server can use certificates of different types. It is expected that ITS
 deployments will see both peers using ITS certificates due to the homogeneity of the ecosystem, but there is no barrier at a technical level that prevents mixed certificate usage. This document defines a new certificate type, 1609Dot2, for usage with
TLS 1.3. The updated CertificateType enumeration and corresponding addition to the CertificateEntry structure are shown below. CertificateType values are sent in the "server_certificate_type" and "client_certificate_type" extensions, and the CertificateEntry
 structures are included in the certificate chain sent in the Certificate message.
	 	 
	In the case of TLS 1.3, the "client_certificate_type" <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> contain a list of supported certificate types proposed by the client as provided in the figure below:
	 


      </t>
<sourcecode>
  /* Managed by IANA */
   enum {
       X509(0),
       RawPublicKey(2),
       1609Dot2(3),
       (255)
   } CertificateType;
   
   struct {
       select (certificate_type) {
       
           /* certificate type defined in this document.*/
            case 1609Dot2:
            opaque cert_data&lt;1..2^24-1>;
            
            /* RawPublicKey defined in RFC 7250*/
           case RawPublicKey:
           opaque ASN.1_subjectPublicKeyInfo&lt;1..2^24-1>;
              
           /* X.509 certificate defined in RFC 8446*/
           case X.509:
           opaque cert_data&lt;1..2^24-1>;

          Extension extensions&lt;0..2^16-1>;
      } CertificateEntry;
</sourcecode>


      <t> As per <xref target="RFC7250"/>, the server processes the received
      [endpoint]_certificate_type extension(s) and selects one of the offered
      certificate types, returning the negotiated value in its
      EncryptedExtensions (TLS 1.3) message. Note that there is no requirement
      for the negotiated value to be the same in client_certificate_type and
      server_certificate_type extensions sent in the same message.</t>

      <t> In the case of TLS 1.3, in order to negotiate the support of ITS
      certificate-based authentication, clients and servers include the

      considerations that need to be taken into account before implementing

        <name>Securely Obtaining Certificates from an Online Repository</name>
        <t>In particular, the certificates used to establish a secure connection <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be obtained from an online repository. An online repository may be used to obtain the CA certificates in the chain of either participant in the secure session.
ETSI TS 102 941 <xref target="TS102941" format="default"/> provides a mechanism that can be used to securely obtain ITS certificates.</t>

        <name>Expiry of Certificates</name>
        <t>Conventions around certificate lifetime differ between ITS
        certificates and X.509 certificates, and in particular, ITS
        certificates may be relatively short lived compared with typical X.509
        certificates. A party to a TLS session that accepts ITS certificates
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> check the expiry time in the received ITS
        certificate and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> terminate a session when the
        certificate received in the handshake expires. </t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Algorithms and Cryptographic Strength</name>
        <t> All ITS certificates use public-key cryptographic algorithms with
        an estimated strength on the order of 128 bits or more, specifically,
        Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based on curves with keys of length
        256 bits or longer. An implementation of the techniques specified in
        this document <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> require that if X.509 certificates
        are used by one of the parties to the session, those certificates are
        associated with cryptographic algorithms with (pre-quantum-computer)
        strength of at least 128 bits.</t>

      <section anchor="ITS-permissions" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Interpreting ITS Certificate Permissions</name>
        <t> ITS certificates in TLS express the certificate holders
        permissions using two fields: a PSID, also known as an ITS Application
        Identifier (ITS-AID), which identifies a broad set of application
        activities that provide a context for the certificate holder's
        permissions, and a Service Specific Permissions (SSP) field associated
        with that PSID, which identifies which specific application activities
        the certificate holder is entitled to carry out within the broad set
        of activities identified by that PSID.  For example, SAE <xref
        target="SAEJ29453" format="default"/> uses PSID 0204099 to indicate
        activities around reporting weather and managing weather response
        activities, and an SSP that states whether the certificate holder is a
        Weather Data Management System (WDMS, i.e., a central road manager),
        an ordinary vehicle, or a vehicle belonging to a managed road
        maintenance fleet. For more information about PSIDs, see <xref
        target="IEEE1609.12" format="default"/>, and for more information about
        the development of SSPs, see <xref target="SAEJ29455"
        format="default"/>.</t>

        <name>Psid and Pdufunctionaltype in CertificateVerify</name>

        <t> The CertificateVerify message for TLS 1.3 is an Ieee1609Dot2Data
        of type signed, where the signature contained in this Ieee1609Dot2Data
	was generated using an ITS certificate. This certificate may
        include multiple PSIDs. When a CertificateVerify message of this form
        is used, the HeaderInfo within the Ieee1609Dot2Data
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have the pduFunctionalType field present and set
        to tlsHandshake. The background to this requirement is as follows: an
        ITS certificate may (depending on the definition of the application
        associated with its PSID(s)) be used to directly sign messages or to
        sign TLS CertificateVerify messages, or both. To prevent the
        possibility that a signature generated in one context could be
        replayed in a different context, i.e., that a message signature could
        be replayed as a CertificateVerify, or vice versa, the
        pduFunctionalType field provides a statement of intent by the signer
        as to the intended use of the signed message. If the pduFunctionalType
        field is absent, the message is a directly signed message for the
        application and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be interpreted as a
        CertificateVerify.</t>
        <t> Note that each PSID is owned by an owning organization that has
        sole rights to define activities associated with that PSID. If an
        application specifier wishes to expand activities associated with an
        existing PSID (for example, to include activities over a secure
        session such as specified in this document), that application
        specifier must negotiate with the PSID owner to have that
        functionality added to the official specification of activities
        associated with that PSID.</t>
