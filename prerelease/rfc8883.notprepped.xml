      <t>
    Network nodes may discard packets if they are unable to process
    protocol headers of packets due to processing constraints or limits.
    When such packets are dropped, the sender receives no indication, so
    it cannot take action to address the cause of discarded packets. This
    specification defines several new ICMPv6 errors that can be sent by a
    node that discards packets because it is unable to process the
    protocol headers. A node that receives such an ICMPv6 error may use
    the information to diagnose packet loss and may modify what it sends
    in future packets to avoid subsequent packet discards.

      <t>
    This document specifies several new ICMPv6 errors that can be sent
    when a node discards a packet due to it being unable to process the
    necessary protocol headers because of processing constraints or
    limits. New ICMPv6 code points are defined to supplement those defined
    in <xref target="RFC4443" format="default"/>.
    Six of the errors are specific to the processing of extension headers;
    another error is used when the aggregate protocol headers in a packet
    exceed the processing limits of a node.

        <name>Extension Header Limits</name>

        <t>
    In IPv6, optional internet-layer information is carried in one or
    more IPv6 extension headers <xref target="RFC8200" format="default"/>.
    Extension headers are placed
    between the IPv6 header and the upper-layer header in a packet. The
    term "header chain" refers collectively to the IPv6 header, extension
    headers, and upper-layer headers occurring in a packet. Individual
    extension headers may have a maximum length of 2048 octets and must
    fit into a single packet. Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options
    contain a list of options in type-length-value (TLV) format. Each
    option includes a length of the data field in octets: the minimum
    size of an option (non-pad type) is two octets, and the maximum size
    is 257 octets. The number of options in an extension header is only
    limited by the length of the extension header and the Path MTU from
    the source to the destination. Options may be skipped over by a
    receiver if they are unknown and the Option Type indicates to skip
    (first two high order bits are 00).
        </t>
        <t>
    Per <xref target="RFC8200" format="default"/>, except for Hop-by-Hop Options, extension
    headers are not examined or processed by intermediate nodes. However, in
    deployed networks, many intermediate nodes do examine extension headers for various
    purposes. For instance, a node may examine all extension headers to
    locate the transport header of a packet in order to implement transport-layer filtering or to track connections to implement a stateful firewall.
        </t>
        <t>
    Destination hosts are expected to process all extension headers and
    options in Hop-by-Hop and Destination Options.
        </t>
        <t>
    Due to the variable lengths, high maximum lengths, or potential for a denial-of-service attack of extension headers, many devices impose
    operational limits on extension headers in packets they process.
    <xref target="RFC7045" format="default"/> discusses the requirements of intermediate
    nodes that discard packets because of unrecognized extension headers.
    <xref target="RFC8504" format="default"/> discusses limits that may be applied to the
    number of options in Hop-by-Hop Options or Destination Options extension
    headers. Both intermediate nodes and end hosts may apply limits to
    extension header processing. When a limit is exceeded, the typical
    behavior is to silently discard the packet.
        </t>
        <t>
    This specification defines six Parameter Problem codes that may be sent
    by a node that discards a packet due to the processing limits of extension
    headers being exceeded. The information in these ICMPv6 errors may be
    used for diagnostics to determine why packets are being dropped.
    Additionally, a source node that receives these ICMPv6 errors may be
    able to modify its use of extension headers in subsequent packets sent
    to the destination in order to avoid further occurrences of packets being
    discarded.

        <name>Aggregate Header Limits</name>
        <t>
    Some hardware devices implement a parsing buffer of a fixed size to
    process packets. The parsing buffer is expected to contain all the
    headers (often up to a transport-layer header for filtering) that a
    device needs to examine. If the aggregate length of headers in a
    packet exceeds the size of the parsing buffer, a device will either
    discard the packet or defer processing to a software slow path. In
    any case, no indication of a problem is sent back to the sender.
        </t>
        <t>
    This document defines one code for ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable
    that is sent by a node that is unable to process the headers of a
    packet due to the aggregate size of the packet headers exceeding a
    processing limit. The information in this ICMPv6 error may be used for
    diagnostics to determine why packets are being dropped. Additionally, a
    source node that receives this ICMPv6 error may be able to modify
    the headers used in subsequent packets to try to avoid further
    occurrences of packets being discarded.
        </t>

      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Nonconformant Packet Discard</name>
        <t>
    The ICMP errors defined in this specification may be applicable to
    scenarios in which a node is dropping packets outside the auspices
    of any standard specification. For instance, an intermediate node
    might send a "Headers too long" code in a case where it drops a
    packet because it is unable to parse deeply enough to extract the transport-layer information needed for packet filtering. Such behavior might be
    considered nonconformant (with respect to
    <xref target="RFC8200" format="default"/>, for instance).
        </t>
        <t>
    This specification does not advocate behaviors that might be
    considered nonconformant. However, packet discard does occur in real
    deployments, and the intent of this specification is to provide
    visibility as to why packets are being discarded. In the spirit that
    providing some reason is better than a silent drop, the sending of ICMP
    errors is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> even in cases where a node
    might be discarding packets per a nonconformant behavior.

        <t>
    An ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable error with code for "Headers
    too long" <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be sent when a node discards a packet because
    the aggregate length of the headers in the packet exceeds the
    processing limits of the node. The Pointer in the extended
    ICMPv6 structure is set to the offset of the first octet that
    exceeds the limit.
        </t>
        <t>
    This error is sent in response to a node dropping a packet
    because the aggregate header chain exceeds the processing
    limits of a node. The aggregate header chain may be composed of
    protocol headers other than an IPv6 header and IPv6 extension
    headers. For instance, in the case of a node parsing a UDP
    encapsulation protocol, the encapsulating UDP header would be
    considered to be in the aggregate header chain.
        </t>
        <t>
    As noted in <xref target="priority"/>, the ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable
    error with code for "Headers too long" has the lowest
    precedence of the ICMP errors discussed in this specification.
    If a packet contains an error corresponding to a Parameter
    Problem code, then a node <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send the Parameter Problem
    error instead of sending the ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable
    error with code for "Headers too long".

    ICMP is fundamentally an unreliable protocol and, in real deployment,
    it may consistently fail over some paths. As with any other use of
    ICMP, it is assumed that the errors defined in this document are only
    the best effort to be delivered. No protocol should be implemented that
    relies on reliable delivery of ICMP messages. If necessary,
    alternative or additional mechanisms may be employed to augment the
    processes used to deduce the reason that packets are being
    discarded. For instance, ICMP error messages may be correlated with
    information attained through Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery
    (PLPMTUD) <xref target="RFC4821" format="default"/> or Happy Eyeballs for IPv6
    <xref target="RFC8305" format="default"/>. Details of the

    End hosts may implement limits on processing extension headers as

    Hardware devices that process packet headers may have limits as to
    how many headers or bytes of headers they can process. For instance,
    a middlebox hardware implementation might have a parsing buffer that
    contains some number of bytes of packet headers to process. Parsing
    buffers typically have a fixed size such as 64, 128, or 256
    bytes. In addition, hardware implementations (and some software
    implementations) often don't have loop constructs. Processing of a
    TLV list might be implemented as an unrolled loop so that the number
    of TLVs that can be processed is limited.
