    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the 608 (Rejected) Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP) response code. This response code enables calling parties to learn
      that an intermediary rejected their call attempt. No one will deliver,
      and thus answer, the call. As a 6xx code, the caller will be aware that
      future attempts to contact the same User Agent Server will likely fail.
      The initial use case driving the need for the 608 response code is when
      the intermediary is an analytics engine. In this case, the rejection is
      by a machine or other process. This contrasts with the 607 (Unwanted)
      SIP response code in which a human at the target User Agent Server
      indicates the user did not want the call. In some jurisdictions, this
      distinction is important. This document also defines the use of the
      Call-Info header field in 608 responses to enable rejected callers to
      contact entities that blocked their calls in error. This provides a
      remediation mechanism for legal callers that find their calls
      blocked.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>

      <t>The IETF has been addressing numerous issues surrounding how to
      handle unwanted and, depending on the jurisdiction, illegal calls <xref
      format="default" target="RFC5039"/>. Secure Telephone Identity Revisited
      (STIR) <xref format="default" target="RFC7340"/> and Signature-based
      Handling of Asserted information using toKENs (SHAKEN) <xref
      format="default" target="SHAKEN"/> address the cryptographic signing and
      attestation, respectively, of signaling to ensure the integrity and
      authenticity of the asserted caller identity.</t>

      <t>This document describes a new <xref format="default"
      target="RFC3261">Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)</xref> response code,
      608, which allows calling parties to learn that an intermediary rejected
      their call. As described below, we need a distinct indicator to
      differentiate between a user rejection and an intermediary's rejection
      of a call. In some jurisdictions, service providers may not be permitted
      to block calls, even if unwanted by the user, unless there is an
      explicit user request. Moreover, users may misidentify the nature of a
      caller.</t>

      <t>For example, a legitimate caller may call a user who finds the call
      to be unwanted. However, instead of marking the call as unwanted, the
      user may mark the call as illegal. With that information, an analytics
      engine may determine to block all calls from that source. However, in
      some jurisdictions, blocking calls from that source for other users may
      not be legal. Likewise, one can envision jurisdictions that allow an
      operator to block such calls, but only if there is a remediation
      mechanism in place to address false positives.</t>

      <t>Some call-blocking services may return responses such as 604 (Does
      Not Exist Anywhere). This might be a strategy to try to get a
      destination's address removed from a calling database. However, other
      network elements might also interpret this to mean the user truly does
      not exist, which might result in the user not being able to receive
      calls from anyone, even if they wanted to receive the calls. In many
      jurisdictions, providing such false signaling is also illegal.</t>

      <t>The 608 response code addresses this need of remediating falsely
      blocked calls. Specifically, this code informs the SIP User Agent Client
      (UAC) that an intermediary blocked the call and provides a redress
      mechanism that allows callers to contact the operator of the
      intermediary.</t>

      <t>In the current call handling ecosystem, users can explicitly reject a
      call or later mark a call as being unwanted by issuing a <xref
      format="default" target="RFC8197">607 SIP response code
      (Unwanted)</xref>. Figures <xref format="counter" target="uas_reject"/>
      and <xref format="counter" target="reject_ladder"/> show the operation
      of the 607 SIP response code. The User Agent Server (UAS) indicates the
      call was unwanted. As <xref format="default" target="RFC8197"/>
      explains, not only does the called party desire to reject that call,
      they can let their proxy know that they consider future calls from that
      source unwanted. Upon receipt of the 607 response from the UAS, the
      proxy may send unwanted call indicators, such as the value of the From
      header field and other information elements, to a call analytics engine.
      For various reasons described in <xref format="default"
      target="RFC8197"/>, if a network operator receives multiple reports of
      unwanted calls, that may indicate that the entity placing the calls is
      likely to be a source of unwanted calls for many people. As such, other
      customers of the service provider may want the service provider to
      automatically reject calls on their behalf.</t>

      <t>There is another value of the 607 rejection code. Presuming the proxy
      forwards the response code to the UAC, the calling UAC or intervening
      proxies will also learn the user is not interested in receiving calls
      from that sender.</t>

      <t>For calls rejected with a 607 from a legitimate caller, receiving a
      607 response code can inform the caller to stop attempting to call the
      user. Moreover, if a legitimate caller believes the user is rejecting
      their calls in error, they can use other channels to contact the user.
      For example, if a pharmacy calls a user to let them know their
      prescription is available for pickup and the user mistakenly thinks the
      call is unwanted and issues a 607 response code, the pharmacy, having an
      existing relationship with the customer, can send the user an email or
      push a note to the pharmacist to ask the customer to consider not
      rejecting their calls in the future.</t>

      <t>Many systems that allow the user to mark the call unwanted (e.g.,
      with the 607 response code) also allow the user to change their mind and
      unmark such calls. This mechanism is relatively easy to implement as the
      user usually has a direct relationship with the service provider that is
      blocking calls.</t>

      <t>However, things become more complicated if an intermediary, such as a
      third-party provider of call management services that classifies calls
      based on the relative likelihood that the call is unwanted,
      misidentifies the call as unwanted. <xref format="default"
      target="cae_reject"/> shows this case. Note that the UAS typically does
      not receive an INVITE since the called party proxy rejects the call on
      behalf of the user. In this situation, it would be beneficial for the
      caller to learn who rejected the call so they can correct the
      misidentification.</t>

      <t>In this situation, one might consider having the intermediary use the
      607 response code. 607 indicates to the caller that the subscriber does
      not want the call. However, <xref format="default" target="RFC8197"/>
      specifies that one of the uses of 607 is to inform analytics engines
      that a user (human) has rejected a call. The problem here is that
      network elements downstream from the intermediary might interpret the
      607 as coming from a user (human) who has marked the call as unwanted,
      as opposed to coming from an algorithm using statistics or machine
      learning to reject the call. An algorithm can be vulnerable to the
      base-rate fallacy <xref format="default" target="BaseRate"/> rejecting
      the call. In other words, those downstream entities should not rely on
      another entity "deciding" the call is unwanted. By distinguishing
      between a (human) user rejection and an intermediary engine's
      statistical rejection, a downstream network element that sees a 607
      response code can weigh it as a human rejection in its call analytics,
      versus deciding whether to consider a 608 at all, and if so, weighing it
      appropriately.</t>

      <t>It is useful for blocked callers to have a redress mechanism. One can
      imagine that some jurisdictions will require it. However, we must be
      mindful that most of the calls that intermediaries block will, in fact,
      be illegal and eligible for blocking. Thus, providing alternate contact
      information for a user would be counterproductive to protecting that
      user from illegal communications. This is another reason we do not
      propose to simply allow alternate contact information in a 607 response
      message.</t>

      <t>Why do we not use the same mechanism an analytics service provider
      offers their customers? Specifically, why not have the analytics service
      provider allow the called party to correct a call blocked in error? The
      reason is that while there is an existing relationship between the
      customer (called party) and the analytics service provider, it is
      unlikely there is a relationship between the caller and the analytics
      service provider. Moreover, there are numerous call blocking providers
      in the ecosystem. Therefore, we need a mechanism for indicating an
      intermediary rejected a call that also provides contact information for
      the operator of that intermediary without exposing the target user's
      contact information.</t>


      <t>The protocol described in this document uses existing SIP protocol
      mechanisms for specifying the redress mechanism. In the Call-Info header
      field passed back to the UAC, we send additional information specifying
      a redress address. We choose to encode the redress address using <xref
      format="default" target="RFC7095">jCard</xref>. As we will see later in
      this document, this information needs to have its own application-layer
      integrity protection. Thus, we use jCard rather than <xref
      format="default" target="RFC6350">vCard</xref>, as we have a marshaling
      mechanism for creating a JavaScript Object Notation <xref
      format="default" target="RFC8259">(JSON)</xref> object, such as a jCard,
      and a standard integrity format for such an object, namely, JSON Web
      Signature <xref format="default" target="RFC7515">(JWS)</xref>. The SIP
      community is familiar with this concept as it is the mechanism used by
      <xref format="default" target="RFC8224">STIR</xref>.</t>

      <t>Integrity protecting the jCard with a cryptographic signature might
      seem unnecessary at first, but it is essential to preventing potential
      network attacks. <xref format="default" target="Security"/> describes
      the attack and why we sign the jCard in more detail.</t>

          <name>JWT Payload</name>

          <t>The payload contains two JSON values. The first JSON Web Token
          (JWT) claim that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present is the <xref
          format="default" target="RFC7519">"iat" (issued at) claim</xref>.
          The "iat" <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to the date and time of the
          issuance of the 608 response. This mandatory component protects the
          response from replay attacks.</t>

          <t>The second JWT claim that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present is the
          "jcard" claim. The value of the <xref format="default"
          target="RFC7095">jcard</xref> claim is a JSON array conforming to
          the JSON jCard data format defined in <xref target="RFC7095"/>. <xref
          format="default" target="JWT-IANA"/> describes the registration. In
          the construction of the jcard claim, the "jcard" <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
          include at least one of the URL, EMAIL, TEL, or ADR properties. UACs
          supporting this specification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prepared to
          receive a full jCard. Call originators (at the UAC) can use the
          information returned by the jCard to contact the intermediary that
          rejected the call to appeal the intermediary's blocking of the call
          attempt. What the intermediary does if the blocked caller contacts
          the intermediary is outside the scope of this document.</t>

        <t>A UAC conforming to this specification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include
        the sip.608 feature-capability indicator in the Feature-Caps header
        field of the INVITE request.</t>

        <t>Upon receiving a 608 response, UACs perform normal SIP processing
        for 6xx responses.</t>
 
        <t>As for the disposition of the jCard itself, the UAC
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> check the "iat" claim in the JWT. As noted in
        <xref format="default" target="JWT"/>, we are concerned about replay
        attacks. Therefore, the UAC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reject jCards that
        come with an expired "iat". The definition of "expired" is a matter of
        local policy. A reasonable value would be on the order of a minute due
        to clock drift and the possibility of the playing of an audio
        announcement before the delivery of the 608 response.</t>
      </section>

      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Legacy Interoperation</name>

        <t>If the UAC indicates support for 608 and the intermediary issues a
        608, life is good, as the UAC will receive all the information it
        needs to remediate an erroneous block by an intermediary. However,
        what if the UAC does not understand 608? For example, how can we
        support callers from a legacy, non-SIP, public-switched network
        connecting to the SIP network via a media gateway?</t>

        <t>We address this situation by having the first network element that
        conforms with this specification play an announcement. See <xref
        format="default" target="announcement"/> for requirements on the
        announcement. The simple rule is a network element that inserts the
        sip.608 feature capability <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to convey at a
        minimum how to contact the operator of the intermediary that rejected
        the call attempt.</t>

        <t>The degenerate case is the intermediary is the only element that
        understands the semantics of the 608 response code. Obviously, any SIP
        device will understand that a 608 response code is a 6xx error.
        However, there are no other elements in the call path that understand
        the meaning of the value of the Call-Info header field. The
        intermediary knows this is the case as the INVITE request will not
        have the sip.608 feature capability. In this case, one can consider
        the intermediary to be the element "inserting" a virtual sip.608
        feature capability. If the caveats described in Sections <xref
        format="counter" target="announcement"/> and <xref format="counter"
        target="Security"/> do not hold, the intermediary <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
        play the announcement.</t>

        <t>Now we take the case where a network element that understands the
        608 response code receives an INVITE for further processing. A network
        element conforming with this specification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> insert
        the sip.608 feature capability per the behaviors described in <xref
        section="4.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC6809"/>.</t>

        <t>Do note that even if a network element plays an announcement
        describing the contents of the 608 response message, the network
        element <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> forward the 608 response code message as
        the final response to the INVITE.</t>

        <t>One aspect of using a feature capability is that only the network
        elements that will either consume (UAC) or play an announcement (media
        gateway, session border controller (SBC) <xref format="default"
        target="RFC7092"/>, or proxy) need to understand the sip.608 feature
        capability. If the other network elements conform to <xref
        section="16.6" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC3261"/>, they will pass
        header fields such as "Feature-Caps: *;+sip.608" unmodified and
        without need for upgrade.</t>

        <t>Because the ultimate disposition of the call attempt will be a
        600-class response, the network element conveying the announcement in
        the legacy direction <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the 183 Session Progress
        response to establish the media session. Because of the small chance
        the UAC is an extremely old legacy device and is using UDP, the UAC
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include support for <xref format="default"
        target="RFC3262">100rel</xref> in its INVITE, the network element
        conveying the announcement <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> Require 100rel in the
        183, and the UAC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> issue a Provisional Response
        ACKnowledgement (PRACK) to which the network element
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> respond 200 OK PRACK.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="announcement" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Announcement Requirements</name>

        <t>There are a few requirements on the element that handles the
        announcement for legacy interoperation.</t>

        <t>As noted above, the element that inserts the sip.608 feature
        capability is responsible for conveying the information referenced by
        the Call-Info header field in the 608 response message. However, this
        specification does not mandate how to convey that information.</t>

        <t>Let us take the case where a telecommunications service provider
        controls the element inserting the sip.608 feature capability. It
        would be reasonable to expect the service provider would play an
        announcement in the media path towards the UAC (caller). It is
        important to note the network element should be mindful of the media
        type requested by the UAC as it formulates the announcement. For
        example, it would make sense for an INVITE that only indicated audio
        codecs in the <xref format="default" target="RFC4566">Session
        Description Protocol (SDP)</xref> to result in an audio announcement.
        Likewise, if the INVITE only indicated <xref format="default"
        target="RFC4103">real-time text</xref> and the network element can
        render the information in the requested media format, the network
        element should send the information in a text format.</t>

        <t>It is also possible for the network element inserting the sip.608
        feature capability to be under the control of the same entity that
        controls the UAC. For example, a large call center might have legacy
        UACs, but have a modern outbound calling proxy that understands the
        full semantics of the 608 response code. In this case, it is enough
        for the outbound calling proxy to digest the Call-Info information and
        handle the information digitally rather than "transcoding" the
        Call-Info information for presentation to the caller.</t>

]]></sourcecode>

        <t>The location https://block.example.net/complaint-jws resolves to a
        JWS. One would construct the JWS as follows.</t>

        <t>The JWS header of this example jCard could be:</t>

        <sourcecode name="" type="json">
{ "alg":"ES256",
  "typ":"vcard+json",
  "x5u":"https://certs.example.net/reject_key.cer"
}
</sourcecode>

        <t>Now, let us construct a minimal jCard. For this example, the jCard
        refers the caller to an email address,
        remediation@blocker.example.net:</t>

        <sourcecode name="" type="json">
["vcard",
  [
    ["version", {}, "text", "4.0"],
    ["fn", {}, "text", "Robocall Adjudication"],
    ["email", {"type":"work"}, "text", 
     "remediation@blocker.example.net"]
  ]
]
</sourcecode>

        <t>With this jCard, we can now construct the JWT:</t>

        <sourcecode name="" type="json">{
  "iat":1546008698,
  "jcard":["vcard",
    [
      ["version", {}, "text", "4.0"],
      ["fn", {}, "text", "Robocall Adjudication"],
      ["email", {"type":"work"},
       "text", "remediation@blocker.example.net"]
    ]
  ]
} </sourcecode>

        <t>To calculate the signature, we need to encode the JSON Object
        Signing and Encryption (JOSE) header and JWT into base64url. As an
        implementation note, one can trim whitespace in the JSON objects to
        save a few bytes. UACs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prepared to receive
        pretty-printed, compact, or bizarrely formatted JSON. For the purposes
        of this example, we leave the objects with pretty whitespace. Speaking
        of pretty vs. machine formatting, these examples have line breaks in
        the base64url encodings for ease of publication in the RFC format. The
        specification of base64url allows for these line breaks, and the
        decoded text works just fine. However, those extra line-break octets
        would affect the calculation of the signature. Implementations
        <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> insert line breaks into the base64url
        encodings of the JOSE header or JWT. This also means UACs
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prepared to receive arbitrarily long octet
        streams from the URI referenced by the Call-Info header field.</t>

        absence or the number of proxies is not relevant to the operation of
        the protocol. They are in the figure to show that proxies that do not
        understand the sip.608 feature capability can still participate in a
        network offering 608 services.</t>

        <t>When the SBC receives the 608 response code, it correlates that
        with the original INVITE from the UAC. The SBC remembers that it
        inserted the sip.608 feature capability, which means it is responsible
        for somehow alerting the UAC the call failed and disclosing whom to
        contact. At this point, the SBC can play a prompt, either natively or
        through a mechanism such as <xref format="default"
        target="RFC4240">NETANN</xref>, that sends the relevant information in
        the appropriate media to the UAC. Since this is a potentially long
        transaction and there is a chance the UAC is using an unreliable
        transport protocol, the UAC will have indicated support for
        provisional responses, the SBC will indicate it requires a PRACK from
        the UAC in the 183 response, the UAC will provide the PRACK, and the
        SBC will acknowledge receipt of the PRACK before playing the
        announcement.</t>

        <t>As an example, the SBC could extract the FN and TEL jCard fields
        and play something like a special information tone (see Section
        6.21.2.1 of Telcordia <xref format="default"
        target="SR-2275">SR-2275</xref> or Section 7 of <xref format="default"
        target="ITU.E.180.1998">ITU-T E.180</xref>), followed by "Your call
        has been rejected by...", followed by a text-to-speech translation of
        the FN text, followed by "You can reach them on...", followed by a
        text-to-speech translation of the telephone number in the TEL
        field.</t>

        <t>Note that the SBC also still sends the full 608 response code,
        including the Call-Info header field, towards the UAC.</t>

      <t>Intermediary operators need to be mindful to whom they are sending
      the 608 response. The intermediary could be rejecting a truly malicious
      caller. This raises two issues. The first is the caller, now alerted
      that an intermediary is automatically rejecting their call attempts, may
      change their call behavior to defeat call-blocking systems. The second,
      and more significant risk, is that by providing a contact in the
      Call-Info header field, the intermediary may be giving the malicious
      caller a vector for attack. In other words, the intermediary will be
      publishing an address that a malicious actor may use to launch an attack
      on the intermediary. Because of this, intermediary operators may wish to
      configure their response to only include a Call-Info header field for
      INVITE, or other signed initiating methods, that pass validation by
      <xref format="default" target="RFC8224">STIR</xref>.</t>

      <t>Another risk is as follows. Consider an attacker that floods a proxy
      that supports the sip.608 feature. However, the SDP in the INVITE
      request refers to a victim device. Moreover, the attacker somehow knows
      there is a 608-aware gateway connecting to the victim who is on a
      segment that lacks the sip.608 feature capability. Because the mechanism
      described here can result in sending an audio file to the target of the
      SDP, an attacker could use the mechanism described by this document as
      an amplification attack, given a SIP INVITE can be under 1 kilobyte and
      an audio file can be hundreds of kilobytes. One remediation for this is
      for devices that insert a sip.608 feature capability to only transmit
      media to what is highly likely to be the actual source of the call
      attempt. A method for this is to only play media in response to a
      STIR-signed INVITE that passes validation. Beyond requiring a valid STIR
      signature on the INVITE, the intermediary can also use remediation
      procedures such as doing the connectivity checks specified by <xref
      format="default" target="RFC8445">Interactive Connectivity
      Establishment</xref>. If the target did not request the media, the check
      will fail.</t>

      <t>Yet another risk is a malicious intermediary that generates a
      malicious 608 response with a jCard referring to a malicious agent. For
      example, the recipient of a 608 may receive a TEL URI in the vCard. When
      the recipient calls that address, the malicious agent could ask for
      personally identifying information. However, instead of using that
      information to verify the recipient's identity, they are phishing the
      information for nefarious ends. A similar scenario can unfold if the
      malicious agent inserts a URI that points to a phishing or other site.
      As such, we strongly recommend the recipient validates to whom they are
      communicating with if asking to adjudicate an erroneously rejected call
      attempt. Since we may also be concerned about intermediate nodes
      modifying contact information, we can address both issues with a single
      solution. The remediation is to require the intermediary to sign the
      jCard. Signing the jCard provides integrity protection. In addition, one
      can imagine mechanisms such as used by <xref format="default"
      target="SHAKEN">SHAKEN</xref>.</t>

      <t>Similarly, one can imagine an adverse agent that maliciously spoofs a
      608 response with a victim's contact address to many active callers who
      may then all send redress requests to the specified address (the basis
      for a denial-of-service attack). The process would occur as follows: (1)
      a malicious agent senses INVITE requests from a variety of UACs and (2)
      spoofs 608 responses with an unsigned redress address before the
      intended receivers can respond, causing (3) the UACs to all contact the
      redress address at once. The jCard encoding allows the UAC to verify the
      blocking intermediary's identity before contacting the redress address.
      Specifically, because the sender signs the jCard, we can
      cryptographically trace the sender of the jCard. Given the protocol
      machinery of having a signature, one can apply local policy to decide
      whether to believe that the sender of the jCard represents the owner of
      the contact information found in the jCard. This guards against a
      malicious agent spoofing 608 responses.</t>

      <t>Specifically, one could use policies around signing certificate
      issuance as a mechanism for traceback to the entity issuing the jCard.
      One check could be verifying that the identity of the subject of the
      certificate relates to the To header field of the initial SIP request,
      similar to validating that the intermediary was vouching for the From
      header field of a SIP request with that identity. Note that we are only
      protecting against a malicious intermediary and not a hidden
      intermediary attack (formerly known as a "man-in-the-middle attack").
      Thus, we only need to ensure the signature is fresh, which is why we
      include "iat". For most implementations, we assume that the intermediary
      has a single set of contact points and will generate the jCard on
      demand. As such, there is no need to directly correlate HTTPS fetches to
      specific calls. However, since the intermediary is in control of the
      jCard and Call-Info response, an intermediary may choose to encode
      per-call information in the URI returned in a given 608 response.
      However, if the intermediary does go that route, the intermediary
      <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use a non-deterministic URI reference mechanism and
      be prepared to return dummy responses to URI requests referencing calls
      that do not exist so that attackers attempting to glean call metadata by
      guessing URIs (and thus calls) will not get any actionable information
      from the HTTPS GET.</t>

      <t>Since the decision of whether to include Call-Info in the 608
      response is a matter of policy, one thing to consider is whether a
      legitimate caller can ascertain whom to contact without including such
      information in the 608. For example, in some jurisdictions, if only the
      terminating service provider can be the intermediary, the caller can
      look up who the terminating service provider is based on the routing
      information for the dialed number. Thus, the Call-Info jCard could be
      redundant information. However, the factors going into a particular
      service provider's or jurisdiction's choice of whether to include
      Call-Info is outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>This document liberally lifts from <xref format="default"
      target="RFC8197"/> in its text and structure. However, the mechanism and
      purpose of 608 is quite different than 607. Any errors are the current
      editor's and not the editor of RFC 8197. Thanks also go to Ken Carlberg
      of the FCC, Russ Housley, Paul Kyzivat, and Tolga Asveren for their
      suggestions on improving the document. Tolga's suggestion to provide a
      mechanism for legacy interoperability served to expand the document by
      50%. In addition, Tolga came up with the jCard attack. Finally, Christer
      Holmberg, as always, provided a close reading and fixed a SIP
      feature-capability bug found by Yehoshua Gev.</t>

      <t>Of course, we appreciated the close read and five pages of comments
      from our estimable Area Director, Adam Roach. In addition, we received
      valuable comments during IETF Last Call and JWT review from Ines Robles,
      Mike Jones, and Brian Campbell, and IESG review from Alissa Cooper, Eric
      Vyncke, Alexey Melnikov, Benjamin Kaduk, Barry Leiba, and with most
      glee, Warren Kumari.</t>

      <t>Finally, Bhavik Nagda provided clarifying edits as well and, more
      especially, wrote and tested an implementation of the 608 response code
      in Kamailio. Code is available at <eref
      target="https://github.com/nagdab/608_Implementation"/>. Grace Chuan
      from MIT regenerated and verified the JWT while working at the FCC.</t>
