      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        Bluetooth Low Energy (hereinafter, Bluetooth LE) was first introduced
   in the Bluetooth 4.0 specification.  Bluetooth LE (which has been
   marketed as Bluetooth Smart) is a low-power wireless technology
   designed for short-range control and monitoring applications.
   Bluetooth LE is currently implemented in a wide range of consumer
   electronics devices, such as smartphones and wearable devices.  Given
   the high potential of this technology for the Internet of Things, the
   Bluetooth Special Interest Group (Bluetooth SIG) and the IETF have
   produced specifications in order to enable IPv6 over Bluetooth LE,
   such as the Internet Protocol Support Profile (IPSP) <xref target="IPSP" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC7668" format="default">RFC 7668</xref>, respectively.  
   Bluetooth 4.0 only supports Bluetooth LE
   networks that follow the star topology.  As a consequence, <xref target="RFC7668" format="default">RFC 7668</xref> was
   specifically developed and optimized for that type of network
   topology.  However, the functionality described in <xref target="RFC7668" format="default">RFC 7668</xref> is not
   sufficient and would fail to enable an IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links.  This
   document specifies mechanisms that are needed to enable IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links. 
   This document does not specify the routing protocol to be used in an
   IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links.

	   The terms "6LoWPAN Node" (6LN), "6LoWPAN Router" (6LR), and "6LoWPAN Border Router" (6LBR) are defined as in <xref target="RFC6775" format="default"/>, with an addition that Bluetooth LE central and Bluetooth LE peripheral (see <xref target="blue"/>) can both be adopted by a 6LN, a 6LR, or a 6LBR.

      <name>Bluetooth LE Networks and the IPSP</name>
      <t>
        Bluetooth LE defines two Generic Access Profile (GAP) roles of relevance herein: the Bluetooth LE central role and the Bluetooth LE peripheral role.
In Bluetooth 4.0, a device in the central role, which is called "central" from now on, was able to manage multiple simultaneous connections with a number of devices in the peripheral role,
        called "peripherals" hereinafter. Bluetooth 4.1 (now deprecated) introduced the possibility for a peripheral to be connected to more than one central
        simultaneously, therefore allowing extended topologies beyond the star topology for a Bluetooth LE network <xref target="BTCorev4.1"/>. In addition, a device may simultaneously
        be a central in a set of link-layer connections, as well as a peripheral in others. 
      </t>
      <t>
        On the other hand, the IPSP enables discovery of IP-enabled devices 
        and the establishment of a link-layer connection for transporting IPv6 packets. The IPSP defines the Node and Router roles for devices that 
        consume/originate IPv6 packets and for devices that can route IPv6 packets, respectively.
   Consistent with Bluetooth 4.1, Bluetooth 4.2 <xref target="BTCorev4.2" format="default"/>, and subsequent Bluetooth versions, a device may implement both roles simultaneously.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document assumes a mesh network composed of Bluetooth LE links, where link-layer
   connections are established between neighboring IPv6-enabled
   devices (see <xref target="three-b" format="none">Section 3.3.2, item 3.b,</xref> and an example in <xref target="Appendix"/>).  The IPv6 forwarding devices of the mesh have to implement both IPSP Node and Router roles, while simpler leaf-only nodes can implement only the Node role. In an IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links, a node is a
   neighbor of another node, and vice versa, if a link-layer connection
   has been established between both by using the IPSP functionality for
   discovery and link-layer connection establishment for IPv6 packet
   transport.

        <name>Protocol Stack</name>
        <t>
 	      <xref target="fig_BLEMeshStack" format="default"/> illustrates the protocol stack for IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE
   links.  The core Bluetooth LE protocol stack comprises two main sections: the Controller and the Host. The former includes the Physical Layer
   and the Link Layer, whereas the latter is composed of the Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP), the Attribute Protocol (ATT), 
   and the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT). The Host and the Controller sections are connected by means of the Host-Controller Interface (HCI). 
   A device that supports the IPSP Node role instantiates one  Internet Protocol Support Service (IPSS), which runs atop GATT.

        <t>Bluetooth 4.2 defines a default MTU for Bluetooth LE of 251 bytes.  Excluding the L2CAP header of 4 bytes, a protocol data unit (PDU)
   size of 247 bytes is available for the layer above L2CAP. (Note: Earlier Bluetooth LE versions offered a maximum amount of 23 bytes for the layer atop L2CAP.)
   The L2CAP provides a fragmentation and reassembly solution for transmitting or receiving larger PDUs. At each link, the IPSP defines means for 
   negotiating a link-layer connection that provides an MTU of 1280 octets or higher for the IPv6 layer <xref target="IPSP"/>.
   As per the present specification, the MTU size for IPv6 mesh over BLE links is 1280 octets.
        </t>
        <t>
            Similarly to <xref target="RFC7668"/>, fragmentation functionality from 6LoWPAN standards is
   not used for IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links. Bluetooth LE's fragmentation support provided 
   by L2CAP is used.

        <name>Subnet Model</name>
        <t>
            For IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links, a multilink model has been
   chosen, as further illustrated in <xref target="fig_SubnetModel"/>.  As IPv6 over Bluetooth
   LE is intended for constrained nodes and for Internet of Things use
   cases and environments, the complexity of implementing a separate
   subnet on each peripheral-central link and routing between the
   subnets appears to be excessive.  In this specification, the benefits
   of treating the collection of point-to-point links between a central
   and its connected peripherals as a single multilink subnet rather
   than a multiplicity of separate subnets are considered to outweigh
   the multilink model's drawbacks as described in <xref target="RFC4903" format="default"/>. 
   With the multilink subnet model, the routers have to take on the responsibility of tracking the multicast state and forwarding 
   multicast in a loop-free manner.
   Note that the route-over functionality defined in <xref target="RFC6775" format="default"/>
   is essential to enabling the multilink subnet model for IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links.

        The following aspects of the Neighbor Discovery optimizations for 6LoWPAN <xref target="RFC6775" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC8505" format="default"/> are applicable to Bluetooth LE 6LNs: 
          </t>
          <ol>
	    <li><t>
        A Bluetooth LE 6LN <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> register its non-link-local addresses with
            its routers by sending a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message with the Extended Address Registration Option (EARO) and process the
            Neighbor Advertisement (NA) accordingly.  
            The EARO option includes a Registration Ownership Verifier (ROVR) field <xref target="RFC8505" format="default"/>.  In the case of Bluetooth LE, by default, the ROVR field
            is filled with the 48-bit device address used by the Bluetooth LE node converted into 64-bit Modified EUI-64 format <xref target="RFC4291" format="default"/>. 
            Optionally, a cryptographic ID (see <xref target="RFC8928" format="default">RFC 8928</xref>) <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be placed in the ROVR field. If a cryptographic ID is used,
            address registration and multihop DAD formats and procedures defined in <xref target="RFC8928"/> <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used unless 
            an alternative mechanism offering equivalent protection is used. 
          </t>
          <t> 
         As per <xref target="RFC8505"/>, a 6LN link-local address does not need to be unique in the multilink subnet. A link-local address only needs to be unique
         from the perspective of the two nodes that use it to communicate (e.g., the 6LN and the 6LR in an NS/NA exchange). Therefore, the exchange 
         of Extended Duplicate Address Request (EDAR) and Extended Duplicate Address Confirmation (EDAC) messages between the 6LR and a 6LBR, which ensures that an address is unique across the domain covered by the 6LBR, does not
         need to take place for link-local addresses.
          </t>
          <t>
     If the 6LN registers multiple addresses that are not based on the
   Bluetooth device address using the same compression context, the
   header compression efficiency may decrease, since only the last registered address can be fully elided (see <xref target="RFC7668" sectionFormat="of" section="3.2.4"/>).
          </t></li>
          <li><t>
     For sending Router Solicitations and processing Router Advertisements, the hosts that participate in an IPv6 mesh over BLE <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>, respectively, follow Sections <xref target="RFC6775" sectionFormat="bare" section="5.3"/> and <xref target="RFC6775" sectionFormat="bare" section="5.4"/>
         of <xref target="RFC6775" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC8505" sectionFormat="of" section="5.6"/>.

     The router behavior for 6LRs and 6LBRs is described in <xref target="RFC6775" sectionFormat="of" section="6"/> and updated by <xref target="RFC8505"/>. However, as per this specification:
     </t><ol type="a">
         <li>Routers <bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14> use multicast NSs to discover other routers' link-layer addresses.</li>

        <li anchor="three-b">As per <xref target="RFC6775" sectionFormat="of" section="6.2"/>, in a dynamic configuration scenario, a 6LR comes up as a non-router and waits to receive a Router Advertisement 
           for configuring its own interface address first before setting its interfaces to advertising interfaces and turning into a router. 
           In order to support such an operation in an IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links, a 6LR first uses the IPSP Node role only. Once the 6LR has established
           a connection with another node currently running as a router and receives a Router Advertisement from that router, the 6LR configures its own 
           interface address, turns into a router, and runs as an IPSP Router. In contrast with a 6LR, a 6LBR uses the IPSP Router role since the 6LBR
           is initialized; that is, the 6LBR uses both the IPSP Node and IPSP Router roles at all times.  See an example in <xref target="Appendix_B"/>.</li>

        matching each address prefix advertised via a Prefix Information Option (PIO) <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/> for use in stateless address autoconfiguration.
        Note that 6CO is not needed for context-based compression when the context is pre-provisioned or provided by out-of-band means
        as, in these cases, the in-band indication (6CO) becomes superfluous.

        The specific optimizations of <xref target="RFC7668"/> for header compression, which
   exploited the star topology and Address Registration Option (ARO) (note that the latter has been updated by EARO as per <xref target="RFC8505"/>), cannot be generalized in an IPv6
   mesh over Bluetooth LE links.  Still, a subset of those optimizations
   can be applied in some cases in such a network.  These cases comprise link-local interactions, non-link-local packet
   transmissions originated by a 6LN (i.e., the first hop from a 6LN), and non-link-local
   packets intended for a 6LN that are originated or forwarded by a neighbor
   of that 6LN (i.e., the last hop toward a 6LN).  For all other packet transmissions, context-based compression <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used.
 
          </t>
          <t>
        When a device transmits a packet to a neighbor, the sender <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> fully elide the source Interface Identifier (IID) if the source IPv6 address is the link-local address based on the sender's Bluetooth device address (SAC=0, SAM=11). The sender also <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> fully elide the destination IPv6 address if it is the link-local address based on the neighbor's Bluetooth device address (DAC=0, DAM=11). 
          </t>
          <t>
        When a 6LN transmits a packet with a non-link-local source address
   that the 6LN has registered with EARO in the next-hop router for the
   indicated prefix, the source address <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be fully elided if it is
   the latest address that the 6LN has registered for the indicated
   prefix (SAC=1, SAM=11).
   If the source non-link-local address is not
   the latest registered by the 6LN and the first 48 bits of the IID match
   the latest address are registered by the 6LN, then the last 16 bits of the IID
   <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be carried inline (SAC=1, SAM=10). Otherwise, if the first 48 bits of the IID do not match,
   then the 64 bits of the IID <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be fully carried inline (SAC=1, SAM=01).

          <t>
       When a router transmits a packet to a neighboring 6LN with a non-link-local destination address, the router <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> fully elide the
   destination IPv6 address if the destination address is the latest
   registered by the 6LN with EARO for the indicated context (DAC=1,
   DAM=11).  If the destination address is a non-link-local address and
   not the latest registered and if the first 48 bits of the IID match those of the latest registered address,
   then the last 16 bits of the IID <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be carried inline (DAC=1, DAM=10). Otherwise, if the first 48 bits of the IID do not match,
   then the 64 bits of the IID <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be fully carried in-line (DAC=1, DAM=01).

          <t>
     The Bluetooth LE Link Layer does not support multicast.  Hence,
   traffic is always unicast between two Bluetooth LE neighboring nodes.  
   If a node needs to send a multicast packet to several neighbors, it has 
   to replicate the packet and unicast it on each link.  However, this may 
   not be energy efficient, and particular care must be taken if the node 
   is battery powered.  A router (i.e., a 6LR or a 6LBR) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> keep track
   of neighboring multicast listeners, and it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> forward multicast 
   packets to neighbors that have not registered as listeners for multicast groups to which the packets are destined.

      <t>
     IPv6 mesh over BLE requires a routing protocol to
   find end-to-end paths.  Unfortunately, the routing protocol may
   generate additional opportunities for threats and attacks to the
   network.

      </t>
      <t>
     <xref target="RFC7416" format="default">RFC 7416</xref> provides a systematic overview of threats and
   attacks on the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks
   (RPL), as well as countermeasures. In that document, described threats and attacks comprise threats due to failures to authenticate, threats due to failure to keep routing information, threats and attacks on integrity, and threats and attacks on availability. Reported countermeasures comprise
confidentiality attack, integrity attack, and availability attack countermeasures.
      </t>
      <t>
     While this specification does not
   state the routing protocol to be used in IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE
   links, the guidance of <xref target="RFC7416"/> is useful when RPL is used in
   such scenarios.  Furthermore, such guidance may partly apply for
   other routing protocols as well.
      </t>
      <t>
     The ROVR can be derived from the Bluetooth device address.  However, such a ROVR can be
   spoofed; therefore, any node connected to the subnet and aware of
   a registered-address-to-ROVR mapping could perform address theft and
   impersonation attacks. Use of Address Protected Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC8928" format="default"/> provides protection
   against such attacks.

      <name>Bluetooth LE Connection Establishment Example</name>
   <t>
      This appendix provides an example of Bluetooth LE connection establishment and use of IPSP roles in an IPv6 mesh over BLE that uses dynamic configuration. The example follows text in <xref target="three-b" format="none">Section 3.3.2, item 3.b</xref>. 
      </t>
      <t>
      The example assumes a network with one 6LBR, two 6LRs, and three 6LNs, as shown in <xref target="fig_Appendix" format="default"/>. Connectivity between the 6LNs and the 6LBR is only possible via the 6LRs.
      </t>
      <t>
      The following text describes the different steps in the example as time evolves. Note that other sequences of events that may lead to the same final scenario are also possible.
      </t>
      <t>
      At the beginning, the 6LBR starts running as an IPSP router, whereas the rest of devices are not yet initialized (<xref target="step1" format="none">Step 1</xref>). Next, the 6LRs start running as IPSP nodes, i.e., they use Bluetooth LE advertisement packets to announce their presence and support of IPv6 capabilities (<xref target="step2" format="none">Step 2</xref>). 
      The 6LBR (already running as an IPSP router) discovers the presence of the 6LRs and establishes one Bluetooth LE connection with each 6LR (<xref target="step3" format="none">Step 3</xref>). After establishment of those link-layer connections (and after reception of Router Advertisements from the 6LBR),  
      the 6LRs start operating as routers and also initiate the IPSP Router role (<xref target="step4" format="none">Step 4</xref>). (Note: whether the IPSP Node role is kept running simultaneously is an implementation decision). Then, 6LNs start running the IPSP Node role (<xref target="step5" format="none">Step 5</xref>). 
      Finally, the 6LRs discover the presence of the 6LNs and establish connections with the latter (<xref target="step6" format="none">Step 6</xref>).

      <name>Node-Joining Procedure</name>
      <t>
      This appendix provides a diagram that illustrates the node-joining procedure. First of all, the joining node advertises its presence in order to allow establishment of Bluetooth LE connections with neighbors that already belong to a network. The neighbors typically run as a 6LR or as a 6LBR. After Bluetooth LE connection establishment, the joining node starts acting as a 6LN. 
      </t>
      <t><xref target="fig_AppendixB" format="default"/> shows the sequence of messages that are exchanged by the 6LN and a neighboring 6LR that already belongs to the network after the establishment of a Bluetooth LE connection between both devices. Initially, the 6LN sends a Router Solicitation (RS) message (1). Then, the 6LR replies 
      with an RA, which includes the PIO (2). After discovering the non-link-local prefix in use in the network, the 6LN creates its non-link-local address and registers that address with EARO (3) in the 6LR, and then multihop DAD is performed (4).
      The next step is the transmission of the NA message sent by the 6LR in response to the NS previously sent by the 6LN (5). 
      If the non-link-local address of the 6LN has been successfully validated, the 6LN can operate as a member of the network it has joined.
