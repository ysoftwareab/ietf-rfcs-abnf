      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>RFC 7274 <xref target="RFC7274" format="default"/> made some changes to the terminology
         used for MPLS Special-Purpose Labels but did not define consistent
         terminology. </t>
      <t>One thing that RFC 7274 did was to deprecate the use of the term
         "reserved labels" when describing a range of labels allocated from a
         registry maintained by IANA.  The term "Reserved" in such a registry
         means "set aside, not to be used", but that range of labels was
         available for allocation according to the policies set out in that
         registry.  The name "Special-Purpose Labels" was introduced in RFC
         7274 in place of the previous term, and the abbreviation "SPL" was
         recommended.</t>
      <t>At the time of writing the first draft version of this document, the IETF was in the
         process of allocating the very first SPLs from the Extended SPL (eSPL)
         range <xref target="RFC8595" format="default"/>.  This document discusses and recommends
         terminology and abbreviations to be used when talking about and
         documenting Special-Purpose Labels.</t>
      <t>This document updates RFC 3032  <xref target="RFC3032" format="default"/> and RFC 7274
         <xref target="RFC7274" format="default"/> in that it changes the terminology for both
         Base SPLs (previously referred to simply as "Special-Purpose Labels") and Extended SPLs.</t>
      <t>This document applies that terminology change to the relevant IANA registry
         and also clarifies the use of the Entropy Label Indicator (7) when immediately
         preceded by the Extension Label (15).</t>

            <li>The values 256-1048575 are currently not available for

     this rule, and that RFC would need to define the ranges that are

        <name>GMPLS Special-Purpose Labels</name>
        <t>Note that IANA maintains a registry that is called "Special-Purpose Generalized Label Values". 
  Labels in that registry have special meaning when present in certain
            signaling objects, are 32 bits long, and are not to be confused with MPLS
            forwarding-plane labels.  This document does not make any changes to the GMPLS
            registry or to how labels from that registry are described.

    <section anchor="terminology" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Terminology and Abbreviations</name>
     <t>
  Prior to the publication of this document, IANA maintained a name space
  for "Special-Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Values" 
  code points <xref target="SPL-NAME-SPACE" format="default"/>.  Within this name space, there are two
  registries.  One was called the "Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values"
  registry <xref target="bSPL" format="default"/>.  The other was called the "Extended Special-Purpose
  MPLS Label Values" registry <xref target="eSPL" format="default"/>.
     </t>

     <t>
  The difference in the name of the name space and the first registry
  is only that the MPLS abbreviation is expanded.  This document makes
  no change to the name of the name space itself (i.e., "Special-Purpose
  Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Values").  This document
  changes the name of the first registry to "Base Special-Purpose MPLS
  Label Values" but leaves the name of the latter registry unchanged
  as "Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values".
     </t>

      <t>The following conventions will be used in specifications and when talking
         about SPLs.
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Collectively, the two (unrelated) ranges (0-15 and 16-1048575) are
               known as "Special-Purpose Labels" (SPLs).</li>
        <li>SPLs from the range 0-15 are called "Base Special-Purpose Labels" (bSPLs).</li>
        <li>SPLs from the range 16-1048575 are called "Extended
               Special-Purpose Labels" (eSPLs).  (Note that the reserved values 0-15 from the
               "Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values" registry do not need a
        name, as they are not available for allocation and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used.)</li>
        <li>The combination of the Extension Label (XL) (value 15, which is a
               bSPL and is also called the "xSPL") and an eSPL is called a
               "Composite Special-Purpose Label" (cSPL).</li>
      </ul>
      <t>This results in label stacks such as the examples shown
         in Figures&nbsp;<xref target="stack-example-1" format="counter"/> and <xref target="stack-example-2" format="counter"/>.</t>

      <name>Clarification on Handling of the Entropy Label Indicator</name>
      <t><xref target="RFC7274" sectionFormat="of" section="3.1"/>
 contains two paragraphs that describe the
         handling of the Entropy Label Indicator (label 7).  These paragraphs have introduced
         some confusion about whether the Entropy Label Indicator can be present when
         immediately preceded by the Extension Label.  This document updates
         <xref target="RFC7274"/> by replacing those paragraphs as follows.</t>
      <t>OLD
      </t>
<blockquote>
     <t>
        Values 0-15 of the "Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values"
               registry are set aside as reserved.  Furthermore, values 0-6 and 8-15
               <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> appear in the data plane following an XL; an LSR processing
               a packet with an XL at the top of the label stack followed by a label
               with value 0-6 or 8-15 <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> drop the packet.
     </t>
        <t>Label 7 (when received) retains its meaning as Entropy Label
               Indicator (ELI) whether a regular special-purpose label or an ESPL;
               this is because of backwards compatibility with existing implemented
               and deployed code and hardware that looks for the ELI without
               verifying if the previous label is XL or not.  However, when an LSR
               inserts an entropy label, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> insert the ELI as a regular
               special-purpose label, not as an ESPL.</t>
</blockquote>
      <t>NEW
      </t>
<blockquote>
        <t>Values 0-15 of the "Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values"
               registry are set aside as reserved.  Furthermore, an implementation
               <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> place a label with a value in the range 0-15 in the label stack immediately following
               an XL; an LSR processing a packet with an XL at the top of the label
               stack immediately followed by a label with a value in the range 0-15 <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> drop the packet.</t>
        <t>When inspecting a label stack to find an Entropy Label Indicator
               (ELI -- label 7), a preexisting implementation may fail to inspect the
               previous label and thus not notice that it is an XL.  Such systems can
               continue to process the entropy information and forward the packet when
               the previous label is an XL without causing harm.  However, the packet
               will be dropped when the XL reaches the top of the stack at another LSR.</t>
