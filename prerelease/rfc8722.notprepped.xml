      <t>
	Many Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols make use
	of commonly defined values that are passed in messages or
	packets.  To ensure consistent interpretation of these values
	between independent implementations, there is a need to ensure
	that the values and associated semantic intent are uniquely
	defined.  The IETF uses registry functions to record assigned
	protocol parameter values and their associated semantic
	intentions.  For each IETF protocol parameter, it is current
	practice for the IETF to delegate the role of Protocol
	Parameter Registry Operator to a nominated entity.  This
	document provides a description of, and the requirements for,
	these delegated functions. This document obsoletes RFC 6220 to
	replace all references to the IETF Administrative Support Activity
	(IASA) and related structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0 Model.

	Many IETF protocols make use of commonly defined values that
	are passed within messages or packets.  To ensure consistent
	interpretation of these values between independent
	implementations, there is a need to ensure that the values
	and associated semantic intent are uniquely defined.  The
	IETF uses registries to record each of the possible values
	of a protocol parameter and their associated semantic
	intent.  These registries, their registration policy, and
	the layout of their content are defined in the so-called
	"IANA Considerations" sections of IETF documents.
      </t>
      <t>
	The organizational separation between the IETF and its
	Protocol Parameter Registry Operators parallels ones that are fairly common among
	standards development organizations (SDOs) although less
	common among technology consortia and similar bodies.  These
	functions have been separated into different organizations for
	several reasons.  They include dealing with administrative
	issues, addressing concerns about maintaining an adequate
	distance between basic policy and specific allocations, and
	avoiding any potential conflicts of interest that might arise
	from commercial or organizational relationships.  For example,
	most ISO and ISO/IEC JTC1 standards that require registration
	activities specify a Registration Authority (RA) or
	Maintenance Agency (MA) that, in turn, control the actual
	registration decisions.  The databases of what is registered
	for each standard may then be maintained by a secretariat or
	database function associated with the RA or MA or, less
	frequently, by the secretariat of the body that created and
	maintains the standard itself.
      </t>
      <t>
	This structural separation of roles exists within several
	places in the IETF framework (e.g., the RFC Editor
	function).  The Internet Architecture Board (IAB), on behalf
	of the IETF, has the responsibility to define and manage the
	relationship with the Protocol Parameter Registry Operator role.  This
	responsibility includes the selection and management of the
	Protocol Parameter Registry Operator, as well as management
	of the parameter registration process and the guidelines for
	parameter allocation.
      </t>
      <t>
	As with other SDOs, although it may delegate authority for
	some specific decisions, the IETF asserts authority and
	responsibility for the management of all of its protocol
	parameters and their registries, even while it generally
	remains isolated from the selection of particular values once
	a registration is approved.  This document describes the
	function of these registries as they apply to individual
	protocol parameters defined by the IETF Internet Standards
	Process (see RFC 6410 <xref target="BCP9" format="default"/>) to allow for an orderly implementation by
	the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC),
	and others as needed, under guidance from the IAB. This
	document obsoletes RFC 6220 to replace all references to the
	IASA and related structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0
	Model <xref target="RFC8711" format="default"/>.

      </t>
      <t>
	Below we provide a description of the requirements for these
	delegated functions, which the IETF traditionally refers to as
	the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Roles and Responsibilities Concerning IETF Protocol Parameter Registries</name>
      <t>
	The IETF's longstanding practice is to outsource the
	management and implementation of some important functions
	(e.g., <xref target="RFC8728" format="default"/>).  The protocol parameter
	registry function falls into this category of outsourced
	functions, and what follows here is the description of the
	roles and responsibilities with respect to the registration of
	IETF protocol parameters.
      </t>
      <t>
	Specifically, this document describes the operation and role
	of a delegated IETF Protocol Parameter Registry Operator, to 
	be selected and administered by the IETF Administrative
	Support Activity (IASA) <xref target="RFC8711" format="default"/>.  While there is generally a
	single Protocol Parameter Registry Operator, additional
	Operators may be selected to implement specific registries,
	and that has been done occasionally.  Having a single Protocol Parameter Registry Operator
	facilitates coordination among registries, even those that are
	not obviously related, and also makes it easier to have
	consistency of formats and registry structure, which aids
	users of the registries and assists with quality control.
      </t>
      <t>
	Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants
	and other well-known values.  Even after a protocol has been
	defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be
	assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new
	encryption or authentication algorithm for IPsec).  To ensure
	that such quantities have consistent values and
	interpretations in different implementations, their assignment
	must be administered by a central authority.  For IETF
	protocols, that role is provided by a delegated Protocol
	Parameter Registry Operator.  For any particular protocol
	parameter there is a single delegated Registry Operator.

        <t>
	  The IETF Protocol Parameter Registry function is undertaken
	  under the auspices of the Internet Architecture Board.
        </t>
        <t>
	  The roles of the Protocol Parameter Registry Operator (Registry Operator) are as

            </t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
		A Registry Operator may be requested to review
		Internet-Drafts that are being considered by the
		Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), with the
		objective of offering advice to the IESG regarding the
		contents of the "IANA Considerations" section, whether
		such a section, when required, is clear in terms of
		direction to the Registry Operator, and whether the
		section is consistent with the current published
		Registry Operator guidelines.
	      </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>

            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
	      To operate a registry of protocol parameter
	      assignments.
	    </li>
              <li>
                <t>
	      The delegated Registry Operator registers values for
	      Internet protocol parameters only as directed by the
	      criteria and procedures specified in RFCs, including
	      Standards Track documents <xref target="BCP9" format="default"/>, Best
	      Current Practice documents, and other RFCs that
	      require protocol parameter assignment.

                </t>
                <t>

	      If values for Internet protocol parameters were not
	      specified, or in case of ambiguity, the Registry
	      Operator will continue to assign and register only
	      those protocol parameters that have already been
	      delegated to the Registry Operator, following past and current
	      practice for such assignments, unless otherwise
	      directed in terms of operating practice by the IESG.
	      In the case of ambiguity, the Registry Operator is
	      expected to identify the ambiguity to the IAB or IESG
	      as appropriate and either suggest better text or ask
	      the appropriate parties for clarification.

              <li>
                <t>

                  <li> any other information specified as being included in the
		registration data in the RFC document that describes the
		parameter.
		</li>
                  <li>
		  If in doubt or in case of a technical dispute, the
		  Registry Operator will seek and follow technical
		  guidance exclusively from the IESG.  Where
		  appropriate, the IESG will appoint an expert to
		  advise the Registry Operator.
		</li>

              </li>
              <li>
	      The Registry Operator will work with the IETF to develop

              <li>
	      Unless special circumstances apply to subsets of the
