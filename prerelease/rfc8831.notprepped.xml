    <abstract>
      <t>The WebRTC framework specifies protocol support for direct, interactive,
rich communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web browsers.
This document specifies the non-media data transport aspects of the WebRTC
framework. It provides an architectural overview of how the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is used in the WebRTC context as a generic
transport service that allows web browsers to exchange generic data from peer to
peer.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>In the WebRTC framework, communication between the parties consists of media
(for example, audio and video) and non-media data.
Media is sent using the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
and is not specified further here.
Non-media data is handled by using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) <xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/> encapsulated
in DTLS. DTLS 1.0 is defined in <xref target="RFC4347" format="default"/>; the present
latest version, DTLS 1.2, is defined in <xref target="RFC6347" format="default"/>; and 
an upcoming version, DTLS 1.3, is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13"/>.</t>

      <t>The encapsulation of SCTP over DTLS
(see <xref target="RFC8261" format="default"/>) over ICE/UDP
(see <xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/>) provides a NAT traversal
solution together with confidentiality, source authentication, and
integrity-protected transfers.
This data transport service operates in parallel to the SRTP media transports,
and all of them can eventually share a single UDP port number.</t>
<t>SCTP, as specified in <xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/> with the partial reliability
extension (PR-SCTP) defined in <xref target="RFC3758" format="default"/> and the additional policies
defined in <xref target="RFC7496" format="default"/>,
provides multiple streams natively with reliable, and the relevant
partially reliable, delivery modes for user messages.
Using the reconfiguration extension defined in <xref target="RFC6525" format="default"/>
allows an increase in the number of streams during the lifetime of an SCTP
association and allows individual SCTP streams to be reset.
Using <xref target="RFC8260" format="default"/> allows the interleave of large messages to
avoid monopolization and adds support for
prioritizing SCTP streams.</t>
      <t>The remainder of this document is organized as follows:
Sections <xref target="sec-use-cases" format="counter"/> and <xref target="sec-req" format="counter"/> provide use cases
and requirements for both unreliable and reliable peer-to-peer data channels;
<xref target="sec-p-a-2" format="default"/> discusses SCTP over DTLS over UDP; and
<xref target="sec-sctp-usage" format="default"/> specifies how SCTP should be
used by the WebRTC protocol framework for transporting non-media data
between web browsers.</t>

        <li>Multiple simultaneous data channels must be supported.
Note that there may be zero or more SRTP media streams in parallel with the data

        <li>Both reliable and unreliable data channels must be supported.</li>
        <li>Data channels of a PeerConnection must be congestion controlled
either individually, as a class, or in conjunction with the SRTP media streams
of the PeerConnection.  This ensures that data channels don't cause congestion
problems for these SRTP media streams, and that the WebRTC PeerConnection does
not cause excessive problems when run in parallel with TCP connections.</li>
        <li>The application should be able to provide guidance as to the
relative priority of each data channel relative to each other
and relative to the SRTP media streams.
This will interact with the congestion control algorithms.</li>
        <li>Data channels must be secured, which allows for confidentiality,
integrity, and source authentication.
See <xref target="RFC8826" format="default"/> and
<xref target="RFC8827" format="default"/> for detailed information.</li>
<li>Data channels must provide message fragmentation support such that
IP-layer fragmentation can be avoided no matter how large a message the
JavaScript application passes to be sent. It also must ensure that large
data channel transfers don't unduly delay traffic on other data
channels.</li>
        <li>The data channel transport protocol must not encode local IP addresses
inside its protocol fields; doing so reveals potentially private information
and leads to failure if the address is depended upon.</li>
        <li>The data channel transport protocol should support unbounded-length "messages"
(i.e., a virtual socket stream) at the application layer for such things as
image-file-transfer; implementations might enforce a reasonable message size
limit.</li>
        <li>The data channel transport protocol should avoid IP fragmentation. It
must support Path MTU (PMTU) discovery and must not rely on ICMP or ICMPv6
being generated or being passed back, especially for PMTU discovery.</li>

      <name>SCTP over DTLS over UDP Considerations</name>
      <t>The important features of SCTP in the WebRTC context are the following:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Usage of TCP-friendly congestion control.</li>
        <li>modifiable congestion control for integration with the
   SRTP media stream congestion control.</li>
        <li>Support of multiple unidirectional streams, each providing its own
   notion of ordered message delivery.</li>
        <li>Support of ordered and out-of-order message delivery.</li>
<li>Support of arbitrarily large user messages by providing fragmentation
   and reassembly.</li>
        <li>Support of PMTU discovery.</li>
        <li>Support of reliable or partially reliable message transport.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The WebRTC data channel mechanism does not support SCTP multihoming.
The SCTP layer will simply act as if it were running on a single-homed host,
since that is the abstraction that the DTLS layer (a connection-oriented,
unreliable datagram service) exposes.</t>
      <t>The encapsulation of SCTP over DTLS defined in
<xref target="RFC8261" format="default"/> provides confidentiality,
source authentication, and integrity-protected transfers.
Using DTLS over UDP in combination with Interactive Connectivity Establishment 
(ICE) <xref target="RFC8445"/> enables middlebox traversal
in IPv4- and IPv6-based networks.
SCTP as specified in <xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/> <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used in
combination with the extension defined in <xref target="RFC3758" format="default"/> and
provides the following features for transporting non-media data between
browsers:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Support of multiple unidirectional streams.</li>
        <li>Ordered and unordered delivery of user messages.</li>
        <li>Reliable and partially reliable transport of user messages.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>Each SCTP user message contains a Payload Protocol Identifier (PPID)
that is passed to SCTP by its upper layer on the sending side and
provided to its upper layer on the receiving side.
The PPID can be used to multiplex/demultiplex multiple upper layers over
a single SCTP association.
In the WebRTC context, the PPID is used to distinguish between
UTF-8 encoded user data,
binary-encoded user data, and
the Data Channel Establishment Protocol (DCEP) defined in
<xref target="RFC8832" format="default"/>.
Please note that the PPID is not accessible via the JavaScript API.</t>
<t>The encapsulation of SCTP over DTLS, together with the SCTP features listed
above, satisfies all the requirements listed in <xref target="sec-req" format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>This stack (especially in contrast to DTLS over SCTP <xref target="RFC6083" format="default"/> and
in combination with SCTP over UDP <xref target="RFC6951" format="default"/>)
has been chosen for the following reasons:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>supports the transmission of arbitrarily large user messages;</li>
        <li>shares the DTLS connection with the SRTP media channels of the
PeerConnection; and</li>
        <li>provides privacy for the SCTP control information.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>Referring to the protocol stack shown in <xref target="fig-sctp-layering" format="default"/>:</t>
<ul spacing="normal">
<li>the usage of DTLS 1.0 over UDP is specified in <xref target="RFC4347" format="default"/>;</li>
<li>the usage of DTLS 1.2 over UDP in specified in <xref target="RFC6347" format="default"/>;</li>
<li>the usage of DTLS 1.3 over UDP is specified in an upcoming document
<xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13"/>; and</li>
<li>the usage of SCTP on top of DTLS is specified in
<xref target="RFC8261" format="default"/>.</li>
</ul>
<t>Please note that the demultiplexing Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)
<xref target="RFC5389"/> vs. SRTP vs. DTLS is done
as described in <xref target="RFC5764" sectionFormat="of" section="5.1.2"/>, and SCTP
is the only payload of DTLS.</t>
      <t>Since DTLS is typically implemented in user application space, the SCTP
stack also needs to be a user application space stack.</t>
      <t>The ICE/UDP layer can handle IP address changes during a session without
needing interaction with the DTLS and SCTP layers.
However, SCTP <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be notified when an address change has happened.
In this case, SCTP <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> retest the Path MTU and reset the congestion
state to the initial state.
In the case of window-based congestion control like the one specified in
<xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/>, this means setting the congestion window and
slow-start threshold to its initial values.</t>
      <t>Incoming ICMP or ICMPv6 messages can't be processed by
the SCTP layer, since there is no way to identify the corresponding
association. Therefore, SCTP <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support performing Path MTU discovery
without relying on ICMP or ICMPv6 as specified in <xref target="RFC4821" format="default"/>
by using probing messages specified in <xref target="RFC4820" format="default"/>.
The initial Path MTU at the IP layer <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> exceed 1200 bytes for IPv4
and 1280 bytes for IPv6.</t>
      <t>In general, the lower-layer interface of an SCTP implementation should be
adapted to address the differences between IPv4 and IPv6 (being connectionless)
or DTLS (being connection oriented).</t>
      <t>When the protocol stack shown in <xref target="fig-sctp-layering" format="default"/> is used, DTLS
protects the complete SCTP packet, so it provides confidentiality, integrity, and
source authentication of the complete SCTP packet.</t>
<t>SCTP provides congestion control on a per-association basis. This means
that all SCTP streams within a single SCTP association share the same
congestion window. Traffic not being sent over SCTP is not covered by
SCTP congestion control.
Using a congestion control different from the standard one might improve
the impact on the parallel SRTP media streams.</t>
      <t>SCTP uses the same port number concept as TCP and UDP.
Therefore, an SCTP association uses two port numbers, one at each SCTP
endpoint.</t>

        <t>In the WebRTC context, the SCTP association will be set up when the
two endpoints of the WebRTC PeerConnection agree on opening it, as negotiated
by the JavaScript Session Establishment Protocol (JSEP), which is typically an
exchange of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC8829" format="default"/>.

        <t>Each SCTP endpoint continuously supervises the reachability of its peer by

an SCTP association to another SCTP endpoint. The streams are used to
provide the notion of in-sequence delivery and for multiplexing.
Each user message is sent on a particular stream, either ordered or unordered.
Ordering is preserved only for ordered messages sent on the same stream.</t>

        <name>Data Channel Definition</name>
        <t>Data channels are defined such that their accompanying application-level API
can closely mirror the API for WebSockets, which implies bidirectional streams
of data and a textual field called 'label' used to identify the meaning of the
data channel.</t>
        <t>The realization of a data channel is a pair of one incoming stream and
one outgoing SCTP stream having the same SCTP stream identifier.
How these SCTP stream identifiers are selected is protocol and implementation

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>reliable or unreliable message transmission:
In case of unreliable transmissions, the same level of unreliability is used.

          <li>a priority, which is a 2-byte unsigned integer:

        <name>Opening a Data Channel</name>
        <t>Data channels can be opened by using negotiation within the SCTP association
(called in-band negotiation) or out-of-band negotiation.
Out-of-band negotiation is defined as any method that results in an agreement
as to the parameters of a channel and the creation thereof.
The details are out of scope of this document. Applications using data
channels need to use the negotiation methods consistently on both endpoints.</t>
        <t>A simple protocol for in-band negotiation is specified in
<xref target="RFC8832" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>When one side wants to open a channel using out-of-band negotiation, it
picks a stream.
Unless otherwise defined or negotiated, the streams are picked based on
the DTLS role (the client picks even stream identifiers, and
the server picks odd stream identifiers).
However, the application is responsible for avoiding collisions with
existing streams.
If it attempts to reuse a stream that is part of an existing data channel,
the addition <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> fail.
In addition to choosing a stream, the application <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also determine
the options to be used for sending messages.
The application <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure in an application-specific manner that
the application at the peer will also know the selected stream to
be used, as well as the options for sending data from that side.</t>

        <t>All data sent on a data channel in both directions <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent over the
underlying stream using the reliability defined when the data channel was
opened, unless the options are changed or per-message options are specified
by a higher level.</t>
        <t>The message orientation of SCTP is used to preserve the message boundaries
of user messages. Therefore, senders <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> put more than one application
message into an SCTP user message. Unless the deprecated PPID-based
fragmentation and reassembly is used, the sender <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include exactly one
application message in each SCTP user message.</t>
        <t>The SCTP Payload Protocol Identifiers (PPIDs) are used to signal the
interpretation of the "payload data". The following PPIDs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used
(see <xref target="sec-IANA" format="default"/>):
</t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>WebRTC String:</dt>
          <dd>
to identify a non-empty JavaScript string encoded in UTF-8.</dd>
          <dt>WebRTC String Empty:</dt>
          <dd>
to identify an empty JavaScript string encoded in UTF-8.</dd>
          <dt>WebRTC Binary:</dt>
          <dd>
to identify non-empty JavaScript binary data
(ArrayBuffer, ArrayBufferView, or Blob).</dd>
          <dt>WebRTC Binary Empty:</dt>
          <dd>
to identify empty JavaScript binary data
(ArrayBuffer, ArrayBufferView, or Blob).</dd>
        </dl>
        <t>SCTP does not support the sending of empty user messages. Therefore, if an
empty message has to be sent, the appropriate PPID (WebRTC String Empty or
WebRTC Binary Empty) is used, and the SCTP user message of one zero byte is
sent. When receiving an SCTP user message with one of these PPIDs, the receiver
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore the SCTP user message and process it as an empty message.</t>
        <t>The usage of the PPIDs "WebRTC String Partial" and "WebRTC Binary Partial"
is deprecated. They were used for a PPID-based fragmentation and reassembly
of user messages belonging to reliable and ordered data channels.</t>
        <t>If a message with an unsupported PPID is received or some error condition
related to the received message is detected by the receiver
(for example, illegal ordering), the receiver <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> close the corresponding
data channel. This implies in particular that extensions using additional
PPIDs can't be used without prior negotiation.</t>
        <t>The SCTP base protocol specified in <xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/> does not
support the interleaving of user messages. Therefore, sending a large user
message can monopolize the SCTP association.
To overcome this limitation, <xref target="RFC8260" format="default"/>
defines an extension to support message interleaving, which <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used.
As long as message interleaving is not supported, the sender
<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> limit the maximum message size to 16 KB to avoid monopolization.</t>
        <t>It is recommended that the message size be kept within certain size bounds,
as applications will not be able to support arbitrarily large single
messages. This limit has to be negotiated, for example, by using
<xref target="RFC8841" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>The sender <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> disable the Nagle algorithm (see <xref target="RFC1122" format="default"/>)
to minimize the latency.</t>

        <name>Closing a Data Channel</name>
        <t>Closing of a data channel <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be signaled by resetting the corresponding
outgoing streams <xref target="RFC6525" format="default"/>. This means that if one side
decides to close the data channel, it resets the corresponding outgoing stream.
When the peer sees that an incoming stream was reset, it also resets its
corresponding outgoing stream. Once this is completed, the data channel is closed.
Resetting a stream sets the Stream Sequence Numbers (SSNs) of the stream back to
'zero' with a corresponding notification to the application layer
that the reset has been performed. Streams are available for reuse after a reset
has been performed.</t>
        <t><xref target="RFC6525" format="default"/> also guarantees that all the messages are delivered
(or abandoned) before the stream is reset.</t>
