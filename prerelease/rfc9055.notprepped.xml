    <abstract>
      <t>A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance
      guarantees to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates and
      bounded latency (including bounded latency variation, i.e.,
      "jitter"). As a result, securing a DetNet requires that in addition to
      the best practice security measures taken for any mission-critical
      network, additional security measures may be needed to secure the
      intended operation of these novel service properties.</t>
      <t> This document addresses DetNet-specific security considerations from
      the perspectives of both the DetNet system-level designer and component
      designer. System considerations include a taxonomy of relevant threats
      and attacks, and associations of threats versus use cases and service
      properties. Component-level considerations include ingress filtering and
      packet arrival-time violation detection.</t>
      <t>This document also addresses security considerations specific to the
      IP and MPLS data plane technologies, thereby complementing the Security
      Considerations sections of those documents.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>A deterministic IP network ("<xref target="RFC8655" format="title"/>" <xref
          target="RFC8655" format="default"/>) can carry data flows for real-time applications with
        extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency. The bounds on latency defined by DetNet
        (as described in <xref target="RFC9016" format="default"/>) include both worst-case latency
        (Maximum Latency, <xref target="RFC9016" section="5.9.2"/>) and worst-case jitter (Maximum
        Latency Variation, <xref target="RFC9016" section="5.9.3"/>). Data flows with deterministic
        properties are well established for Ethernet networks (see Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN),
          <xref target="IEEE802.1BA" format="default"/>); DetNet brings these capabilities to the IP
        network.</t>
      <t>Deterministic IP networks have been successfully deployed in real-time Operational
        Technology (OT) applications for some years; however, such networks are typically isolated
        from external access, and thus the security threat from external attackers is low. An
        example of such an isolated network is a network deployed within an aircraft, which is "air
        gapped" from the outside world. DetNet specifies a set of technologies that enable creation
        of deterministic flows on IP-based networks of a potentially wide area (on the scale of a
        corporate network), potentially merging OT traffic with best-effort Information Technology
        (IT) traffic, and placing OT network components into contact with IT network components,
        thereby exposing the OT traffic and components to security threats that were not present in
        an isolated OT network. </t>
      <t>These DetNet (OT-type) technologies may not have previously been deployed on a wide area
        IP-based network that also carries IT traffic, and thus they can present security
        considerations that may be new to IP-based wide area network designers; this document
        provides insight into such system-level security considerations. In addition, designers of
        DetNet components (such as routers) face new security-related challenges in providing DetNet
        services, for example, maintaining reliable isolation between traffic flows in an
        environment where IT traffic co-mingles with critical reserved-bandwidth OT traffic; this
        document also examines security implications internal to DetNet components. </t>
      <t>Security is of particularly high importance in DetNet because many of the use cases that
        are enabled by DetNet <xref target="RFC8578" format="default"/> include control of physical
        devices (power grid devices, industrial controls, building controls, etc.) that can have
        high operational costs for failure and present potentially attractive targets for cyber
        attackers. </t>
      <t>This situation is even more acute given that one of the goals of DetNet is to provide a
        "converged network", i.e., one that includes both IT traffic and OT traffic, thus exposing
        potentially sensitive OT devices to attack in ways that were not previously common (usually
        because they were under a separate control system or otherwise isolated from the IT network,
        for example <xref target="ARINC664P7" format="default"/>). Security considerations for OT
        networks are not a new area, and there are many OT networks today that are connected to wide
        area networks or the Internet; this document focuses on the issues that are specific to the
        DetNet technologies and use cases. </t>
      <t>Given the above considerations, securing a DetNet starts with a scrupulously well-designed
        and well-managed engineered network following industry best practices for security at both
        the data plane and controller plane, as well as for any Operations, Administration, and
        Maintenance (OAM) implementation; this is the assumed starting point for the considerations
        discussed herein. Such assumptions also depend on the network components themselves
        upholding the security-related properties that are to be assumed by DetNet system-level
        designers; for example, the assumption that network traffic associated with a given flow can
        never affect traffic associated with a different flow is only true if the underlying
        components make it so. Such properties, which may represent new challenges to component
        designers, are also considered herein. </t>
      <t>Starting with a "well-managed network", as noted above, enables us to exclude some of the
        more powerful adversary capabilities from the Internet Threat Model of <xref target="BCP72"
          format="default"/>, such as the ability to arbitrarily drop or delay any or all traffic.
        Given this reduced attacker capability, we can present security considerations based on
        attacker capabilities that are more directly relevant to a DetNet.</t>
      <t>In this context, we view the "conventional" (i.e., non-time-sensitive) network design and
        management aspects of network security as being primarily concerned with preventing denial
        of service, i.e., they must ensure that DetNet traffic goes where it's supposed to and that
        an external attacker can't inject traffic that disrupts the delivery timing assurance of the
        DetNet. The time-specific aspects of DetNet security presented here take up where those
        "conventional" design and management aspects leave off. </t>
      <t>However, note that "conventional" methods for mitigating (among all the others)
        denial-of-service attacks (such as throttling) can only be effectively used in a DetNet when
        their use does not compromise the required time-sensitive or behavioral properties required
        for the OT flows on the network. For example, a "retry" protocol is typically not going to
        be compatible with a low-latency (worst-case maximum latency) requirement; however, if in a
        specific use case and implementation such a retry protocol is able to meet the timing
        constraints, then it may well be used in that context. Similarly, if common security
        protocols such as TLS/DTLS or IPsec are to be used, it must be verified that their
        implementations are able to meet the timing and behavioral requirements of the
        time-sensitive network as implemented for the given use case. An example of "behavioral
        properties" might be that dropping of more than a specific number of packets in a row is not
        acceptable according to the service level agreement.</t>
      <t>The exact security requirements for any given DetNet are necessarily specific to the use
        cases handled by that network. Thus, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the specific
        security requirements of their use cases, for example, those outlined in the DetNet Use
        Cases <xref target="RFC8578" format="default"/> and the Security Considerations sections of
        the DetNet documents applicable to the network technologies in use, for example, <xref
          target="RFC8939" format="default"/> for an IP data plane and <xref target="RFC8964"
          format="default"/> for an MPLS data plane. Readers can find a general introduction to the
        DetNet Architecture in <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"/>, the DetNet Data Plane in
          <xref target="RFC8938" format="default"/>, and the Flow Information Model in <xref
          target="RFC9016" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>The DetNet technologies include ways to: </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li> Assign data plane resources for DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes
          (routers) along the path of the flow</li>
        <li> Provide explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not dynamically change with the
          network topology in ways that affect the quality of service received by the affected
          flow(s) </li>
        <li> Distribute data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of
          the data in each packet in spite of the loss of a path</li>
      </ul>
      <t>This document includes sections considering DetNet component design as well as system
        design. The latter includes a taxonomy and analysis of threats, threat impacts and
        mitigations, and an association of attacks with use cases (based on <xref target="RFC8578"
          sectionFormat="of" section="11"/>). </t>
      <t>This document is based on the premise that there will be a very broad range of DetNet
        applications and use cases, ranging in size and scope from individual industrial machines to
        networks that span an entire country <xref target="RFC8578" format="default"/>. Thus, no
        single set of prescriptions (such as exactly which mitigation should be applied to which
        segment of a DetNet) can be applicable to all of them, and indeed any single one that we
        might prescribe would inevitably prove impractical for some use case, perhaps one that does
        not even exist at the time of this writing. Thus, we are not prescriptive here; we are
        stating the desired end result, with the understanding that most DetNet use cases will
        necessarily differ from each other, and there is no "one size fits all". </t>

      <name>Security Considerations for DetNet Component Design</name>
      <t>This section provides guidance for implementers of components to be used in a DetNet. </t>
      <t>As noted above, DetNet provides resource allocation, explicit routes, and redundant path
        support. Each of these has associated security implications, which are discussed in this
        section, in the context of component design. Detection, reporting and appropriate action in
        the case of packet arrival-time violations are also discussed.</t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Resource Allocation</name>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Inviolable Flows</name>
          <t>A DetNet system security designer relies on the premise that any resources allocated to
            a resource-reserved (OT-type) flow are inviolable; in other words, there is no physical
            possibility within a DetNet component that resources allocated to a given DetNet flow
            can be compromised by any type of traffic in the network. This includes malicious
            traffic as well as inadvertent traffic such as might be produced by a malfunctioning
            component, or due to interactions between components that were not sufficiently tested
            for interoperability. From a security standpoint, this is a critical assumption, for
            example, when designing against DoS attacks. In other words, with correctly designed
            components and security mechanisms, one can prevent malicious activities from impacting
            other resources.</t>

          <t>However, achieving the goal of absolutely inviolable flows may not be technically or
            economically feasible for any given use case, given the broad range of possible use
            cases (e.g., <xref target="RFC8578"/>) and their associated security considerations as
            outlined in this document. It can be viewed as a continuum of security requirements,
            from isolated ultra-low latency systems that may have little security vulnerability
            (such as an industrial machine) to broadly distributed systems with many possible attack
            vectors and OT security concerns (such as a utility network). Given this continuum, the
            design principle employed in this document is to specify the desired end results,
            without being overly prescriptive in how the results are achieved, reflecting the
            understanding that no individual implementation is likely to be appropriate for every
            DetNet use case. </t>
        </section>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">

          <name>Design Trade-Off Considerations in the Use Cases Continuum</name>
          <t>For any given DetNet use case and its associated security requirements, it is important
            for the DetNet system designer to understand the interaction and design trade-offs that
            inevitably need to be reconciled between the desired end results and the DetNet
            protocols, as well as the DetNet system and component design. </t>
          <t>For any given component, as designed for any given use case (or scope of use cases), it
            is the responsibility of the component designer to ensure that the premise of inviolable
            flows is supported to the extent that they deem necessary to support their target use
            cases. </t>
          <t>For example, the component may include traffic shaping and policing at the ingress to
            prevent corrupted, malicious, or excessive packets from entering the network, thereby
            decreasing the likelihood that any traffic will interfere with any DetNet OT flow. The
            component may include integrity protection for some or all of the header fields such as
            those used for flow ID, thereby decreasing the likelihood that a packet whose flow ID
            has been compromised might be directed into a different flow path. The component may
            verify every single packet header at every forwarding location, or only at certain
            points. In any of these cases, the component may use dynamic performance analytics
              (<xref target="DpaMitigation" format="default"/>) to cause action to be initiated to
            address the situation in an appropriate and timely manner, either at the data plane or
            controller plane, or both in concert. The component's software and hardware may include
            measures to ensure the integrity of the resource allocation/deallocation process. Other
            design aspects of the component may help ensure that the adverse effects of malicious
            traffic are more limited, for example, by protecting network control interfaces or
            minimizing cascade failures. The component may include features specific to a given use
            case, such as configuration of the response to a given sequential packet loss count. </t>
          <t>Ultimately, due to cost and complexity factors, the security properties of a component
            designed for low-cost systems may be (by design) far inferior to a component with
            similar intended functionality, but designed for highly secure or otherwise critical
            applications, perhaps at substantially higher cost. Any given component is designed for
            some set of use cases and accordingly will have certain limitations on its security
            properties and vulnerabilities. It is thus the responsibility of the system designer to
            assure themselves that the components they use in their design are capable of satisfying
            their overall system security requirements. </t>
        </section>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Documenting the Security Properties of a Component</name>
          <t>In order for the system designer to adequately understand the security-related behavior
            of a given component, the designer of any component intended for use with DetNet needs
            to clearly document the security properties of that component. For example, to address
            the case where a corrupted packet in which the flow identification information is
            compromised and thus may incidentally match the flow ID of another ("victim") DetNet
            flow, resulting in additional unauthorized traffic on the victim, the documentation
            might state that the component employs integrity protection on the flow identification
            fields. </t>
        </section>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Fail-Safe Component Behavior</name>
          <t>Even when the security properties of a component are understood and well specified, if
            the component malfunctions, for example, due to physical circumstances unpredicted by
            the component designer, it may be difficult or impossible to fully prevent malfunction
            of the network. The degree to which a component is hardened against various types of
            failures is a distinguishing feature of the component and its design, and the overall
            system design can only be as strong as its weakest link. </t>
          <t>However, all networks are subject to this level of uncertainty; it is not unique to
            DetNet. Having said that, DetNet raises the bar by changing many added latency scenarios
            from tolerable annoyances to unacceptable service violations. That in turn underscores
            the importance of system integrity, as well as correct and stable configuration of the
            network and its nodes, as discussed in <xref target="Introduction" format="default"/>.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Flow Aggregation Example</name>
          <t>As another example regarding resource allocation implementation, consider the
            implementation of Flow Aggregation for DetNet flows (as discussed in <xref
              target="RFC8938" format="default"/>). In this example, say there are N flows that are
            to be aggregated; thus, the bandwidth resources of the aggregate flow must be sufficient
            to contain the sum of the bandwidth reservation for the N flows. However, if one of
            those flows were to consume more than its individually allocated bandwidth, this could
            cause starvation of the other flows. Thus, simply providing and enforcing the calculated
            aggregate bandwidth may not be a complete solution; the bandwidth for each individual
            flow must still be guaranteed, for example, via ingress policing of each flow (i.e.,
            before it is aggregated). Alternatively, if by some other means each flow to be
            aggregated can be trusted not to exceed its allocated bandwidth, the same goal can be
            achieved. </t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Explicit Routes</name>
        <t>The DetNet-specific purpose for constraining the ability of the DetNet to reroute OT
          traffic is to maintain the specified service parameters (such as upper and lower latency
          boundaries) for a given flow. For example, if the network were to reroute a flow (or some
          part of a flow) based exclusively on statistical path usage metrics, or due to malicious
          activity, it is possible that the new path would have a latency that is outside the
          required latency bounds that were designed into the original TE-designed path, thereby
          violating the quality of service for the affected flow (or part of that flow). </t>
        <t>However, it is acceptable for the network to reroute OT traffic in such a way as to
          maintain the specified latency bounds (and any other specified service properties) for any
          reason, for example, in response to a runtime component or path failure. </t>
        <t>So from a DetNet security standpoint, the DetNet system designer can expect that any
          component designed for use in a DetNet will deliver the packets within the agreed-upon
          service parameters. For the component designer, this means that in order for a component
          to achieve that expectation, any component that is involved in controlling or implementing
          any change of the initially TE-configured flow routes must prevent rerouting of OT flows
          (whether malicious or accidental) that might adversely affect delivering the traffic
          within the specified service parameters.</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">


        <name>Redundant Path Support</name>
        <t>The DetNet provision for redundant paths (i.e., PREOF, or "Packet Replication,
          Elimination, and Ordering Functions"), as defined in the DetNet Architecture <xref
            target="RFC8655" format="default"/>, provides the foundation for high reliability of a
          DetNet by virtually eliminating packet loss (i.e., to a degree that is implementation
          dependent) through hitless redundant packet delivery. </t>
        <aside>
          <t>Note: At the time of this writing, PREOF is not defined for the IP data plane.</t>

        <t>It is the responsibility of the system designer to determine the level of reliability
          required by their use case and to specify redundant paths sufficient to provide the
          desired level of reliability (in as much as that reliability can be provided through the
          use of redundant paths). It is the responsibility of the component designer to ensure that
          the relevant PREOF operations are executed reliably and securely to avoid potentially
          catastrophic situations for the operational technology relying on them. </t>
        <t>However, note that not all PREOF operations are necessarily implemented in every network;
          for example, a packet reordering function may not be necessary if the packets are either
          not required to be in order or if the ordering is performed in some other part of the
          network.</t>
        <t>Ideally, a redundant path for a flow could be specified from end to end; however, given
          that this is not always possible (as described in <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"
          />), the system designer will need to consider the resulting end-to-end reliability and
          security resulting from any given arrangement of network segments along the path, each of
          which provides its individual PREOF implementation and thus its individual level of
          reliability and security. </t>
        <t>At the data plane, the implementation of PREOF depends on the correct assignment and
          interpretation of packet sequence numbers, as well as the actions taken based on them,
          such as elimination (including elimination of packets with spurious sequence numbers).
          Thus, the integrity of these values must be maintained by the component as they are
          assigned by the DetNet Data Plane Service sub-layer and transported by the Forwarding
          sub-layer. This is no different than the integrity of the values in any header used by the
          DetNet (or any other) data plane and is not unique to redundant paths. The integrity
          protection of header values is technology dependent; for example, in Layer 2 networks, the
          integrity of the header fields can be protected by using MACsec <xref
            target="IEEE802.1AE-2018" format="default"/>. Similarly, from the sequence number
          injection perspective, it is no different from any other protocols that use sequence
          numbers; for particulars of integrity protection via IPsec Authentication Headers, useful
          insights are provided by <xref target="RFC4302" sectionFormat="of" section="3"
            format="default"/>.</t>

        <name>Timing (or Other) Violation Reporting</name>
        <t>A task of the DetNet system designer is to create a network such
        that for any incoming packet that arrives with any timing or bandwidth
        violation, an appropriate action can be taken in order to prevent
        damage to the system. The reporting step may be accomplished through
        dynamic performance analysis (see <xref target="DpaMitigation"
        format="default"/>) or by any other means as implemented in one or
        more components. The action to be taken for any given circumstance
        within any given application will depend on the use case. The action
        may involve intervention from the controller plane, or it may be taken
        "immediately" by an individual component, for example, if a very fast
        response is required. </t>
        <t>The definitions and selections of the actions that can be taken are
        properties of the components. The component designer implements these
        options according to their expected use cases, which may vary widely
        from component to component. Clearly, selecting an inappropriate
        response to a given condition may cause more problems than it is
        intending to mitigate; for example, a naive approach might be to have
        the component shut down the link if a packet arrives outside of its
        prescribed time window. However, such a simplistic action may serve
        the attacker better than it serves the network. Similarly, simple
        logging of such issues may not be adequate since a delay in response
        could result in material damage, for example, to mechanical devices
        controlled by the network. Thus, a breadth of possible and effective
        security-related actions and their configuration is a positive
        attribute for a DetNet component.</t>
        <t>Some possible violations that warrant detection include cases where
        a packet arrives: </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Outside of its prescribed time window</li>
          <li>Within its time window but with a compromised timestamp that
          makes it appear that it is not within its window</li>
          <li>Exceeding the reserved flow bandwidth</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Some possible direct actions that may be taken at the data plane include traffic policing
          and shaping functions (e.g., those described in <xref target="RFC2475" format="default"
          />), separating flows into per-flow rate-limited queues, and potentially applying active
          queue management <xref target="RFC7567" format="default"/>. However, if those (or any
          other) actions are to be taken, the system designer must ensure that the results of such
          actions do not compromise the continued safe operation of the system. For example, the
          network (i.e., the controller plane and data plane working together) must mitigate in a
          timely fashion any potential adverse effect on mechanical devices controlled by the
          network. </t>

      <name>DetNet Security Considerations Compared with Diffserv Security Considerations</name>
      <t>DetNet is designed to be compatible with Diffserv <xref target="RFC2474" format="default"/>
        as applied to IT traffic in the DetNet. DetNet also incorporates the use of the 6-bit value
        of the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field of the Type of Service (IPv4) and
        Traffic Class (IPv6) bytes for flow identification. However, the DetNet interpretation of
        the DSCP value for OT traffic is not equivalent to the per-hop behavior (PHB) selection
        behavior as defined by Diffserv. </t>
      <t>Thus, security considerations for DetNet have some aspects in common with Diffserv, in fact
        overlapping 100% with respect to IP IT traffic. Security considerations for these aspects
        are part of the existing literature on IP network security, specifically the Security
        Considerations sections of <xref target="RFC2474" format="default"/> and <xref
          target="RFC2475" format="default"/>. However, DetNet also introduces timing and other
        considerations that are not present in Diffserv, so the Diffserv security considerations are
        a subset of the DetNet security considerations. </t>
      <t>In the case of DetNet OT traffic, the DSCP value is interpreted differently than in
        Diffserv and contributes to determination of the service provided to the packet. In DetNet,
        there are similar consequences to Diffserv for lack of detection of, or incorrect handling
        of, packets with mismarked DSCP values, and many of the points made in the Diffserv Security
        discussions (<xref target="RFC2475" sectionFormat="of" section="6.1" format="default"/>,
          <xref target="RFC2474" sectionFormat="of" section="7" format="default"/>, and <xref
          target="RFC6274" sectionFormat="of" section="3.3.2.1" format="default"/>) are also
        relevant to DetNet OT traffic though perhaps in modified form. For example, in DetNet, the
        effect of an undetected or incorrectly handled maliciously mismarked DSCP field in an OT
        packet is not identical to affecting the PHB of that packet, since DetNet does not use the
        PHB concept for OT traffic. Nonetheless, the service provided to the packet could be
        affected, so mitigation measures analogous to those prescribed by Diffserv would be
        appropriate for DetNet. For example, mismarked DSCP values should not cause failure of
        network nodes. The remarks in <xref target="RFC2474" format="default"/> regarding IPsec and
        Tunneling Interactions are also relevant (though this is not to say that other sections are
        less relevant). </t>
      <t>In this discussion, interpretation (and any possible intentional re-marking) of the DSCP
        values of packets destined for DetNet OT flows is expected to occur at the ingress to the
        DetNet domain; once inside the domain, maintaining the integrity of the DSCP values is
        subject to the same handling considerations as any other field in the packet.</t>

      <name>Security Threats</name>
      <t>This section presents a taxonomy of threats and analyzes the possible threats in a
        DetNet-enabled network. The threats considered in this section are independent of any
        specific technologies used to implement the DetNet; <xref target="TechnologySpecificThreats"
          format="default"/> considers attacks that are associated with the DetNet technologies
        encompassed by <xref target="RFC8938" format="default"/>. </t>
      <t> We distinguish controller plane threats from data plane threats. The attack surface may be
        the same, but the types of attacks, as well as the motivation behind them, are different.
        For example, a Delay attack is more relevant to the data plane than to the controller plane.
        There is also a difference in terms of security solutions; the way you secure the data plane
        is often different than the way you secure the controller plane. </t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Threat Taxonomy</name>
        <t>This document employs organizational elements of the threat models of <xref
            target="RFC7384" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC7835" format="default"/>. This
          model classifies attackers based on two criteria: </t>

        <dl newline="true">
          <dt>Internal vs. external:</dt>
          <dd> Internal attackers either have access to a trusted segment of the network or possess
            the encryption or authentication keys. External attackers, on the other hand, do not
            have the keys and have access only to the encrypted or authenticated traffic. </dd>

          <dt>On-path vs. off-path:</dt>
          <dd> On-path attackers are located in a position that allows interception, modification,
            or dropping of in-flight protocol packets, whereas off-path attackers can only attack by
            generating protocol packets. </dd>
        </dl>

        <t>Regarding the boundary between internal vs. external attackers as
        defined above, note that in this document we do not make concrete
        recommendations regarding which specific segments of the network are
        to be protected in any specific way, for example, via encryption or
        authentication. As a result, the boundary as defined above is not
        unequivocally specified here. Given that constraint, the reader can
        view an internal attacker as one who can operate within the perimeter
        defined by the DetNet Edge Nodes (as defined in the DetNet
        Architecture <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"/>), allowing that
        the specifics of what is encrypted or authenticated within this
        perimeter will vary depending on the implementation. </t>
        <t>Care has also been taken to adhere to <xref target="RFC3552"
        sectionFormat="of" section="5" format="default"/>, both with respect
        to which attacks are considered out of scope for this document, and
        also which are considered to be the most common threats (explored
        further in <xref target="ThreatAnalysis" format="default"/>). Most of
        the direct threats to DetNet are active attacks (i.e., attacks that
        modify DetNet traffic), but it is highly suggested that DetNet
        application developers take appropriate measures to protect the
        content of the DetNet flows from passive attacks (i.e., attacks that
        observe but do not modify DetNet traffic), for example, through the
        use of TLS or DTLS. </t>
        <t>DetNet-Service, one of the service scenarios described in <xref
        target="I-D.varga-detnet-service-model" format="default"/>, is the
        case where a service connects DetNet islands, i.e., two or more
        otherwise independent DetNets are connected via a link that is not
        intrinsically part of either network. This implies that there could be
        DetNet traffic flowing over a non-DetNet link, which may provide an
        attacker with an advantageous opportunity to tamper with DetNet
        traffic. The security properties of non-DetNet links are outside of
        the scope of DetNet Security, but it should be noted that use of
        non-DetNet services to interconnect DetNets merits security analysis
        to ensure the integrity of the networks involved. </t>

          <t>An attacker can maliciously delay DetNet data flow traffic. By delaying the traffic,

            delays or to high delay variation. The delay may be constant or modulated.</t>

        <section anchor="ModificationThreat" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>DetNet Flow Modification or Spoofing</name>
          <t>An attacker can modify some header fields of en route packets in a way that causes the
            DetNet flow identification mechanisms to misclassify the flow. Alternatively, the
            attacker can inject traffic that is tailored to appear as if it belongs to a legitimate
            DetNet flow. The potential consequence is that the DetNet flow resource allocation
            cannot guarantee the performance that is expected when the flow identification works
            correctly.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="SegmentThreat" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Resource Segmentation (Inter-segment Attack) Vulnerability</name>
          <t>DetNet components are expected to split their resources between DetNet flows in a way
            that prevents traffic from one DetNet flow from affecting the performance of other
            DetNet flows and also prevents non-DetNet traffic from affecting DetNet flows. However,
            perhaps due to implementation constraints, some resources may be partially shared, and
            an attacker may try to exploit this property. For example, an attacker can inject
            traffic in order to exhaust network resources such that DetNet packets that share
            resources with the injected traffic may be dropped or delayed. Such injected traffic may
            be part of DetNet flows or non-DetNet traffic.</t>

          <t>Another example of a Resource Segmentation attack is the case in which an attacker is
            able to overload the exception path queue on the router, i.e., a "slow path" typically
            taken by control or OAM packets that are diverted from the data plane because they
            require processing by a CPU. DetNet OT flows are typically configured to take the "fast
            path" through the data plane to minimize latency. However, if there is only one queue
            from the forwarding Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) to the exception
            path, and for some reason the system is configured such that any DetNet packets must be
            handled on this exception path, then saturating the exception path could result in the
            delaying or dropping of DetNet packets. </t>

            <t>Redundancy is intended to increase the robustness and survivability of DetNet flows,
              and replication over multiple paths can potentially mitigate an attack that is limited
              to a single path. However, the fact that packets are replicated over multiple paths
              increases the attack surface of the network, i.e., there are more points in the

            <name>Replication-Related Header Manipulation</name>
            <t>An attacker can manipulate the replication-related header fields. This capability
              opens the door for various types of attacks. For example:</t>

            <dl newline="true">

              <dt>Forward both replicas: </dt>
              <dd>Malicious change of a packet SN (Sequence Number) can cause both replicas of the
                packet to be forwarded. Note that this attack has a similar outcome to a replay
                attack. </dd>

              <dt>Eliminate both replicas: </dt>
              <dd>SN manipulation can be used to cause both replicas to be eliminated. In this case,
                an attacker that has access to a single path can cause packets from other paths to
                be dropped, thus compromising some of the advantage of path redundancy. </dd>

              <dt>Flow hijacking: </dt>
              <dd>An attacker can hijack a DetNet flow with access to a single path by
                systematically replacing the SNs on the given path with higher SN values. For
                example, an attacker can replace every SN value S with a higher value S+C, where C
                is a constant integer. Thus, the attacker creates a false illusion that the attacked
                path has the lowest delay, causing all packets from other paths to be eliminated in
                favor of the attacked path. Once the flow from the compromised path is favored by
                the eliminating bridge, the flow has effectively been hijacked by the attacker. It
                is now possible for the attacker to either replace en route packets with malicious
                packets, or to simply inject errors into the packets, causing the packets to be
                dropped at their destination. </dd>

              <dt>Amplification: </dt>
              <dd>An attacker who injects packets into a flow that is to be replicated will have
                their attack amplified through the replication process. This is no different than
                any attacker who injects packets that are delivered through multicast, broadcast, or
                other point-to-multi-point mechanisms. </dd>

      <name>Security Threat Impacts</name>

      <t>When designing security for a DetNet, as with any network, it may be prohibitively
        expensive or technically infeasible to thoroughly protect against every possible threat.
        Thus, the security designer must be informed (for example, by an application domain expert
        such as a product manager) regarding the relative significance of the various threats and
        their impact if a successful attack is carried out. In this section, we present an example
        of a possible template for such a communication, culminating in a table (<xref
          target="ThreatIndustryMapping" format="default"/>) that lists a set of threats under
        consideration, and some values characterizing their relative impact in the context of a
        given industry. The specific threats, industries, and impact values in the table are
        provided only as an example of this kind of assessment and its communication; they are not
        intended to be taken literally.</t>
      <t>This section considers assessment of the relative impacts of the attacks described in <xref
          target="ThreatSection" format="default"/>. In this section, the impacts as described
        assume that the associated mitigation is not present or has failed. Mitigations are
        discussed in <xref target="ThreatMitigation" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t> In computer security, the impact (or consequence) of an incident can be measured in loss
        of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information. In the case of OT or time
        sensitive networks (though not to the exclusion of IT or non-time-sensitive networks), the
        impact of an exploit can also include failure or malfunction of mechanical and/or other
        physical systems. </t>
      <t>DetNet raises these stakes significantly for OT applications, particularly those that may
        have been designed to run in an OT-only environment and thus may not have been designed for
        security in an IT environment with its associated components, services, and protocols. </t>
      <t>The extent of impact of a successful vulnerability exploit varies considerably by use case
        and by industry; additional insight regarding the individual use cases is available from
          "<xref target="RFC8578" format="title"/>" <xref target="RFC8578" format="default"/>. Each
        of those use cases is represented in <xref target="ThreatIndustryMapping" format="default"
        />, including Pro Audio, Electrical Utilities, Industrial M2M (split into two areas: M2M
        Data Gathering and M2M Control Loop), and others. </t>
      <t>Aspects of Impact (left column) include Criticality of Failure, Effects of Failure,
        Recovery, and DetNet Functional Dependence. Criticality of failure summarizes the
        seriousness of the impact. The impact of a resulting failure can affect many different
        metrics that vary greatly in scope and severity. In order to reduce the number of variables,
        only the following were included: Financial, Health and Safety, Effect on a Single
        Organization, and Effect on Multiple Organizations. Recovery outlines how long it would take
        for an affected use case to get back to its pre-failure state (Recovery Time Objective, RTO)
        and how much of the original service would be lost in between the time of service failure
        and recovery to original state (Recovery Point Objective, RPO). DetNet dependence maps how
        much the following DetNet service objectives contribute to impact of failure: time
        dependency, data integrity, source node integrity, availability, and latency/jitter.</t>
      <t>The scale of the Impact mappings is low, medium, and high. In some use cases, there may be
        a multitude of specific applications in which DetNet is used. For simplicity, this section
        attempts to average the varied impacts of different applications. This section does not
        address the overall risk of a certain impact that would require the likelihood of a failure
        happening. </t>
      <t>In practice, any such ratings will vary from case to case; the ratings shown here are given
        as examples.</t>

          <t>Note that "Delay attack" also includes the possibility of a "negative delay" or early
            arrival of a packet, or possibly adversely changing the timestamp value. </t>
          <t> Delayed messages in a DetNet link can result in the same behavior as dropped messages
            in ordinary networks, since the services attached to the DetNet flow are likely to have
            strict delivery time requirements.</t>
          <t>For a single-path scenario, disruption within the single flow is a real possibility. In
            a multipath scenario, large delays or instabilities in one DetNet flow can also lead to
            increased buffer and processor resource consumption at the eliminating router.</t>
          <t>A data plane Delay attack on a system controlling substantial moving devices, for
            example, in industrial automation, can cause physical damage. For example, if the
            network promises a bounded latency of 2 ms for a flow, yet the machine receives it with
            5 ms latency, the control loop of the machine may become unstable. </t>

        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Controller Plane Delay Attacks</name>
          <t>In and of itself, this is not directly a threat to the DetNet service, but the effects
            of delaying control messages can have quite adverse effects later.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>Delayed teardown can lead to resource leakage, which in turn can result in failure
              to allocate new DetNet flows, finally giving rise to a denial-of-service attack.</li>
            <li>Failure to deliver, or severely delaying, controller plane messages adding an
              endpoint to a multicast group will prevent the new endpoint from receiving expected
              frames thus disrupting expected behavior.</li>
            <li>Delaying messages that remove an endpoint from a group can lead to loss of privacy,
              as the endpoint will continue to receive messages even after it is supposedly
              removed.</li>

        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Flow Modification</name>
          <t>If the contents of a packet header or body can be modified by the attacker, this can
            cause the packet to be routed incorrectly or dropped, or the payload to be corrupted or
            subtly modified. Thus, the potential impact of a Modification attack includes disrupting
            the application as well as the network equipment.</t>

          <section numbered="true" toc="default">

            <t>Spoofing data plane messages can result in increased resource consumption on the
              routers throughout the network as it will increase buffer usage and processor
              utilization. This can lead to resource exhaustion and/or increased delay.</t>
            <t>If the attacker manages to create valid headers, the false messages can be forwarded
              through the network, using part of the allocated bandwidth. This in turn can cause
              legitimate messages to be dropped when the resource budget has been exhausted.</t>
            <t>Finally, the endpoint will have to deal with invalid messages being delivered to the
              endpoint instead of (or in addition to) a valid message.</t>

          <t>Injection of false messages in a DetNet flow could lead to exhaustion of the available
            bandwidth for that flow if the routers attribute these false messages to the resource
            budget of that flow. </t>
          <t>In a multipath scenario, injected messages will cause increased processor utilization
            in elimination routers. If enough paths are subject to malicious injection, the
            legitimate messages can be dropped. Likewise, it can cause an increase in buffer usage.
            In total, it will consume more resources in the routers than normal, giving rise to a
            resource-exhaustion attack on the routers.</t>
          <t>If a DetNet flow is interrupted, the end application will be affected by what is now a
            non-deterministic flow. Note that there are many possible sources of flow interruptions,
            for example, but not limited to, such physical-layer conditions as a broken wire or a
            radio link that is compromised by interference. </t>

          <name>Controller Plane Segmentation</name>
          <t> In a successful Controller Plane Segmentation attack, control messages are acted on by
            nodes in the network, unbeknownst to the central controller or the network engineer.
            This has the potential to: </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>create new DetNet flows (exhausting resources)</li>
            <li>drop existing DetNet flows (denial of service)</li>

          <t>If an attacker can inject control messages without the central controller knowing, then
            one or more components in the network may get into a state that is not expected by the
            controller. At that point, if the controller initiates a command, the effect of that
            command may not be as expected, since the target of the command may have started from a

          <dt>Description: </dt>
          <dd>
            <t>Integrity protection in the scope of DetNet is the ability to detect if a packet
              header has been modified (maliciously or otherwise) and if so, take some appropriate
              action (as discussed in <xref target="DpaMitigation" format="default"/>). The decision
              on where in the network to apply integrity protection is part of the DetNet system
              design, and the implementation of the protection method itself is a part of a DetNet
              component design.</t>
            <t>The most common technique for detecting header modification is
            the use of a Message Authentication Code (MAC) (see <xref
            target="TechnologySpecificThreats" format="default"/> for
            examples). The MAC can be distributed either in line (included in
            the same packet) or via a side channel. Of these, the in-line
            method is generally preferred due to the low latency that may be
            required on DetNet flows and the relative complexity and
            computational overhead of a sideband approach. </t>
            <t> There are different levels of security available for integrity
            protection, ranging from the basic ability to detect if a header
            has been corrupted in transit (no malicious attack) to stopping a
            skilled and determined attacker capable of both subtly modifying
            fields in the headers as well as updating an unkeyed
            checksum. Common for all are the 2 steps that need to be performed
            in both ends. The first is computing the checksum or MAC. The
            corresponding verification step must perform the same steps before
            comparing the provided with the computed value. Only then can the
            receiver be reasonably sure that the header is authentic.</t>
            <t> The most basic protection mechanism consists of computing a
            simple checksum of the header fields and providing it to the next
            entity in the packets path for verification. Using a MAC combined
            with a secret key provides the best protection against
            Modification and Replication attacks (see Sections <xref
            target="ModificationThreat" format="counter"/> and <xref
            target="ReplicationThreat" format="counter"/>). This MAC usage
            needs to be part of a security association that is established and
            managed by a security association protocol (such as IKEv2 for
            IPsec security associations). Integrity protection in the
            controller plane is discussed in <xref
            target="ControllerProtectSection" format="default"/>. The secret
            key, regardless of the MAC used, must be protected from falling
            into the hands of unauthorized users. Once key management becomes
            a topic, it is important to understand that this is a delicate
            process and should not be undertaken lightly. BCP 107 <xref
            target="BCP107" format="default"/> provides best practices in this
            regard.</t>
            <t> DetNet system and/or component designers need to be aware of
            these distinctions and enforce appropriate integrity-protection
            mechanisms as needed based on a threat analysis. Note that adding
            integrity-protection mechanisms may introduce latency; thus, many
            of the same considerations in <xref
            target="EncryptionConsiderations" format="default"/> also apply
            here.</t>

          <dt>Packet Sequence Number Integrity Considerations: </dt>
          <dd>

            <t>The use of PREOF in a DetNet implementation implies the use of
            a sequence number for each packet. There is a trust relationship
            between the component that adds the sequence number and the
            component that removes the sequence number. The sequence number
            may be end-to-end source to destination, or it may be
            added/deleted by network edge components. The adder and remover(s)
            have the trust relationship because they are the ones that ensure
            that the sequence numbers are not modifiable. Thus, sequence
            numbers can be protected by using authenticated encryption or by a
            MAC without using encryption. Between the adder and remover there
            may or may not be replication and elimination functions. The
            elimination functions must be able to see the sequence
            numbers. Therefore, if encryption is done between adders and
            removers, it must not obscure the sequence number. If the sequence
            removers and the eliminators are in the same physical component,
            it may be possible to obscure the sequence number; however, that
            is a layer violation and is not recommended practice. </t>

          <dd>With some queuing methods such as <xref

          introduce synthetic traffic in order to regularize the timing of
          packet transmission. (Synthetic traffic typically consists of randomly
          generated packets injected in the network to mask observable
          transmission patterns in the flows, which may allow an attacker to
          gain insight into the content of the flows). This can subsequently
          reduce the value of passive monitoring from internal threats (see
          <xref target="ThreatSection" format="default"/>) as it will be much
          more difficult to associate discrete events with particular network

          constant traffic rate even when no user data is transmitted, thus
          making it difficult to collect information about the times at which
          users are active and the times at which DetNet flows are added or

          <dt>Traffic Insertion Challenges: </dt>

            <t>Once an attacker is able to monitor the frames traversing a
            network to such a degree that they can differentiate between
            best-effort traffic and traffic belonging to a specific DetNet
            flow, it becomes difficult to not reveal to the attacker whether a
            given frame is valid traffic or an inserted frame. Thus, having
            the DetNet components generate and remove the synthetic traffic may or
            may not be a viable option unless certain challenges are solved;
            for example, but not limited to:</t>

            <ul>

              <li>Inserted traffic must be indistinguishable from valid stream traffic from the
                viewpoint of the attacker. </li>

              <li>DetNet components must be able to safely identify and remove
              all inserted traffic (and only inserted traffic). </li>

              <li>
                <t>The controller plane must manage where to insert and remove
                synthetic traffic, but this information must not be revealed to an

                <t>An alternative design is to have the insertion and removal
                of synthetic traffic be performed at the application layer rather
                than by the DetNet itself. For example, the use of RTP padding
                to reduce information leakage from variable-bit-rate audio
                transmission via the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol

            <t>Reconnaissance attacks (<xref target="ReconnaissanceThreat" format="default"/>) can
              be mitigated to some extent through the use of encryption, thereby preventing the
              attacker from accessing the packet header or contents. Specific encryption protocols
              will depend on the lower layers that DetNet is forwarded over. For example, IP flows
              may be forwarded over IPsec <xref target="RFC4301" format="default"/>, and Ethernet
              flows may be secured using MACsec <xref target="IEEE802.1AE-2018" format="default"/>. </t>

            <t>However, despite the use of encryption, a reconnaissance attack can provide the
              attacker with insight into the network, even without visibility into the packet. For
              example, an attacker can observe which nodes are communicating with which other nodes,
              including when, how often, and with how much data. In addition, the timing of packets
              may be correlated in time with external events such as action of an external device.
              Such information may be used by the attacker, for example, in mapping out specific
              targets for a different type of attack at a different time. </t>

            <t>DetNet nodes do not have any need to inspect the payload of any DetNet packets,
              making them data agnostic. This means that end-to-end encryption at the application
              layer is an acceptable way to protect user data. </t>

            <t>Note that reconnaissance is a threat that is not specific to DetNet flows; therefore,
              reconnaissance mitigation will typically be analyzed and provided by a network
              operator regardless of whether DetNet flows are deployed. Thus, encryption
              requirements will typically not be defined in DetNet technology-specific
              specifications, but considerations of using DetNet in encrypted environments will be
              discussed in these specifications. For example, <xref target="RFC8939"
                sectionFormat="of" section="5.1.2.3" format="default"/> discusses flow
              identification of DetNet flows running over IPsec. </t>

          <dd>As noted above, encryption can be used to mitigate reconnaissance attacks (<xref
              target="ReconnaissanceThreat" format="default"/>). However, for a DetNet to provide
            differentiated quality of service on a flow-by-flow basis, the network must be able to
            identify the flows individually. This implies that in a reconnaissance attack, the

        <section anchor="EncryptionConsiderations" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Encryption Considerations for DetNet</name>
          <t>Any compute time that is required for encryption and decryption processing ("crypto")
            must be included in the flow latency calculations. Thus, cryptographic algorithms used in a
            DetNet must have bounded worst-case execution times, and these values must be used in
            the latency calculations. Fortunately, encryption and decryption operations typically
            are designed to have constant execution times in order to avoid side channel leakage. </t>
          <t>Some cryptographic algorithms are symmetric in encode/decode time (such as AES), and others
            are asymmetric (such as public key algorithms). There are advantages and disadvantages
            to the use of either type in a given DetNet context. The discussion in this document
            relates to the timing implications of crypto for DetNet; it is assumed that integrity
            considerations are covered elsewhere in the literature.</t>
          <t>Asymmetrical crypto is typically not used in networks on a packet-by-packet basis due
            to its computational cost. For example, if only endpoint checks or checks at a small
            number of intermediate points are required, asymmetric crypto can be used to
            authenticate distribution or exchange of a secret symmetric crypto key; a successful
            check based on that key will provide traffic origin verification as long as the key is
            kept secret by the participants. TLS (v1.3 <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/>, in
            particular, Section <xref target="RFC8446" sectionFormat="bare" section="4.1">"Key
              Exchange Messages"</xref>) and IKEv2 <xref target="RFC6071" format="default"/> are
            examples of this for endpoint checks.</t>
          <t>However, if secret symmetric keys are used for this purpose, the key must be given to
            all relays, which increases the probability of a secret key being leaked. Also, if any
            relay is compromised or faulty, then it may inject traffic into the flow. Group key
            management protocols can be used to automate management of such symmetric keys; for an
            example in the context of IPsec, see <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipsecme-g-ikev2"
              format="default"/>. </t>
          <t>Alternatively, asymmetric crypto can provide traffic origin verification at every
            intermediate node. For example, a DetNet flow can be associated with an (asymmetric)
            keypair, such that the private key is available to the source of the flow and the public
            key is distributed with the flow information, allowing verification at every node for
            every packet. However, this is more computationally expensive. </t>
          <t>In either case, origin verification also requires replay detection as part of the
            security protocol to prevent an attacker from recording and resending traffic, e.g., as
            a denial-of-service attack on flow forwarding resources.</t>
          <t>In the general case, cryptographic hygiene requires the generation of new keys during
            the lifetime of an encrypted flow (e.g., see <xref target="RFC4253" sectionFormat="of"
              section="9" format="default"/>), and any such key generation (or key exchange)
            requires additional computing time, which must be accounted for in the latency
            calculations for that flow. For modern ECDH (Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman)
            key-exchange operations (such as x25519 <xref target="RFC7748" format="default"/>),
            these operations can be performed in constant (predictable) time; however, this is not
            universally true (for example, for legacy RSA key exchange <xref target="RFC4432"
              format="default"/>). Thus, implementers should be aware of the time properties of
            these algorithms and avoid algorithms that make constant-time implementation difficult
            or impossible.</t>

          <dt>Description: </dt>


          <dd>Control and signaling messages can be protected through the use of any or all of
            encryption, authentication, and integrity-protection mechanisms. Compared with data
            flows, the timing constraints for controller and signaling messages may be less strict,
            and the number of such packets may be fewer. If that is the case in a given application,
            then it may enable the use of asymmetric cryptography for the signing of both payload
            and headers for such messages, as well as encrypting the payload. Given that a DetNet is
            managed by a central controller, the use of a shared public key approach for these
            processes is well proven. This is further discussed in <xref
              target="EncryptionConsiderations" format="default"/>. </dd>

          <dt>Related attacks: </dt>

          <dt>Description: </dt>
          <dd>
            <t>Incorporating Dynamic Performance Analytics (DPA) implies that the DetNet design
              includes a performance monitoring system to validate that timing guarantees are being
              met and to detect timing violations or other anomalies that may be the symptom of a
              security attack or system malfunction. If this monitoring system detects unexpected
              behavior, it must then cause action to be initiated to address the situation in an
              appropriate and timely manner, either at the data plane or controller plane or both in
              concert. </t>
            <t>The overall DPA system can thus be decomposed into the "detection" and "notification"
              functions. Although the time-specific DPA performance indicators and their
              implementation will likely be specific to a given DetNet, and as such are nascent
              technology at the time of this writing, DPA is commonly used in existing networks so
              we can make some observations on how such a system might be implemented for a DetNet
              given that it would need to be adapted to address the time-specific performance
              indicators. </t>

          </dd>

          <dt>Detection Mechanisms: </dt>
          <dd>
            <t>Measurement of timing performance can be done via "passive" or "active" monitoring,
              as discussed below. </t>
            <t>Examples of passive monitoring strategies include:</t>

            <ul>
              <li>Monitoring of queue and buffer levels, e.g., via active queue management (e.g.,
                  <xref target="RFC7567" format="default"/>). </li>

              <li>Monitoring of per-flow counters. </li>

              <li>Measurement of link statistics such as traffic volume, bandwidth, and QoS. </li>

              <li>Detection of dropped packets. </li>

              <li>Use of commercially available Network Monitoring tools. </li>
            </ul>

            <t>Examples of active monitoring include: </t>

            <ul>

              <li>In-band timing measurements (such as packet arrival times), e.g., by timestamping
                and packet inspection. </li>

              <li>
                <t>Use of OAM. For DetNet-specific OAM considerations, see
                <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip-oam" format="default"/> and
                <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls-oam"
                format="default"/>. Note: At the time of this writing,
                specifics of DPA have not been developed for the DetNet OAM
                but could be a subject for future investigation.</t>

		  <ul>
		    <li>For OAM for Ethernet specifically, see also
		    Connectivity Fault Management (CFM <xref
		    target="IEEE802.1Q" format="default"/>), which defines
		    protocols and practices for OAM for paths through 802.1
		    bridges and LANs.
		    </li>
		  </ul>

              </li>


              <li>Out-of-band detection. Following the data path or parts of a data path, for
                example, Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD, e.g., <xref target="RFC5880"
                  format="default"/>). </li>


            </ul>

            <t>Note that for some measurements (e.g., packet delay), it may be necessary to make and
              reconcile measurements from more than one physical location (e.g., a source and
              destination), possibly in both directions, in order to arrive at a given performance
              indicator value. </t>


          </dd>

          <dt>Notification Mechanisms: </dt>
          <dd>

            <t>Making DPA measurement results available at the right place(s) and time(s) to effect
              timely response can be challenging. Two notification mechanisms that are in general
              use are NETCONF/YANG Notifications and the proprietary local telemetry interfaces
              provided with components from some vendors. The Constrained Application Protocol
              (CoAP) Observe Option <xref target="RFC7641" format="default"/> could also be relevant
              to such scenarios. </t>

            <t>At the time of this writing, YANG Notifications are not addressed by the DetNet YANG
              documents; however, this may be a topic for future work. It is possible that some of
              the passive mechanisms could be covered by notifications from non-DetNet-specific YANG
              modules; for example, if there is OAM or other performance monitoring that can monitor
              delay bounds, then that could have its own associated YANG data model, which could be
              relevant to DetNet, for example, some "threshold" values for timing measurement
              notifications. </t>

            <t>At the time of this writing, there is an IETF Working Group for network/performance
              monitoring (IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)). See also previous work by the completed
              Remote Network Monitoring Working Group (RMONMIB). See also "<xref target="RFC6632"
                format="title"/>", <xref target="RFC6632" format="default"/>. </t>

            <t>Vendor-specific local telemetry may be available on some commercially available
              systems, whereby the system can be programmed (via a proprietary dedicated port and
              API) to monitor and report on specific conditions, based on both passive and active
              measurements. </t>

          </dd>

          <dt>Related attacks: </dt>

          <dd>

            <t>Performance analytics can be used to detect various attacks, including the ones
              described in <xref target="DelayThreat" format="default"/> (Delay attack), <xref
                target="SegmentThreat" format="default"/> (Resource Segmentation attack), and <xref
                target="SyncThreat" format="default"/> (Time-Synchronization attack). Once detection
              and notification have occurred, the appropriate action can be taken to mitigate the
              threat. </t>

            <t>For example, in the case of data plane Delay attacks, one possible mitigation is to
              timestamp the data at the source and timestamp it again at the destination, and if the
              resulting latency does not meet the service agreement, take appropriate action. Note
              that DetNet specifies packet sequence numbering; however, it does not specify use of
              packet timestamps, although they may be used by the underlying transport (for example,
              TSN <xref target="IEEE802.1BA" format="default"/>) to provide the service. </t>

          <t>DetNet is expected to run over various transmission mediums, with Ethernet being the
            first identified. Attacks such as Delay or Reconnaissance might be implemented
            differently on a different transmission medium; however, the impact on the DetNet as a
            whole would be essentially the same. We thus conclude that all attacks and impacts that

            would also be applicable to DetNet over other transmission mediums. </t>

            for other mediums, other mitigations would have to be implemented to provide analogous

          <name>Hot Swap</name>
          <t>A DetNet network is not expected to be "plug and play"; it is expected that there is
            some centralized network configuration and control system. However, the ability to "hot
            swap" components (e.g., due to malfunction) is similar enough to "plug and play" that
            this kind of behavior may be expected in DetNet networks, depending on the
            implementation. </t>
          <t>An attack surface related to hot swap is that the DetNet network must at least consider
            input at runtime from components that were not part of the initial configuration of the
            network. Even a "perfect" (or "hitless") replacement of a component at runtime would not
            necessarily be ideal, since presumably one would want to distinguish it from the
            original for OAM purposes (e.g., to report hot swap of a failed component). </t>

          <t>This implies that an attack such as Flow Modification, Spoofing, or Inter-segment
            (which could introduce packets from a "new" component, i.e., one heretofore unknown on
            the network) could be used to exploit the need to consider such packets (as opposed to
            rejecting them out of hand as one would do if one did not have to consider introduction
            of a new component).</t>
          <t>To mitigate this situation, deployments should provide a method for dynamic and secure
            registration of new components, and (possibly manual) deregistration and re-keying of
            retired components. This would avoid the situation in which the network must accommodate
            potentially insecure packet flows from unknown components. </t>
          <t>Similarly, if the network was designed to support runtime replacement of a clock
            component, then presence (or apparent presence) and thus consideration of packets from a
            new such component could affect the network, or the time synchronization of the network,
            for example, by initiating a new Best Master Clock selection process. These types of
            attacks should therefore be considered when designing hot-swap-type functionality (see
              <xref target="RFC7384" format="default"/>). </t>

          <t>Packets that are part of a resource-reserved DetNet flow are not to be dropped by the
            DetNet due to congestion. Packets may however be dropped for intended reasons, for
            example, security measures. For example, consider the case in which a packet becomes
            corrupted (whether incidentally or maliciously) such that the resulting flow ID
            incidentally matches the flow ID of another DetNet flow, potentially resulting in
            additional unauthorized traffic on the latter. In such a case, it may be a security
            requirement that the system report and/or take some defined action, perhaps when a
            packet drop count threshold has been reached (see also <xref target="DpaMitigation"
              format="default"/>). </t>
          <t>A data plane attack may force packets to be dropped, for example, as a result of a
            Delay attack, Replication/Elimination attack, or Flow Modification attack. </t>
          <t>The same result might be obtained by a Controller plane attack, e.g., Path Manipulation
            or Signaling Packet Modification.</t>
          <t>An attack may also cause packets that should not be delivered to be delivered, such as
            by forcing packets from one (e.g., replicated) path to be preferred over another path
            when they should not be (Replication attack), or by Flow Modification, or Path Choice or
            Packet Injection. A Time-Synchronization attack could cause a system that was expecting
            certain packets at certain times to accept unintended packets based on compromised
            system time or time windowing in the scheduler. </t>

          <t>There are many proprietary "fieldbuses" used in Industrial and other industries, as

            intended to provide an open-standards-based alternative to such buses/networks. In cases
            where a DetNet intersects with such fieldbuses/networks or their protocols, such as by

          <name>Deterministic vs. Best-Effort Traffic</name>
          <t>Most of the themes described in this document address OT (reserved) DetNet flows --
            this item is intended to address issues related to IT traffic on a DetNet.</t>
          <t>DetNet is intended to support coexistence of time-sensitive operational (OT,
            deterministic) traffic and informational (IT, "best effort") traffic on the same
            ("unified") network. </t>

          <t>With DetNet, this coexistence will become more common, and mitigations will need to be
            established. The fact that the IT traffic on a DetNet is limited to a
            corporate-controlled network makes this a less difficult problem compared to being
            exposed to the open Internet; however, this aspect of DetNet security should not be
            underestimated. </t>
          <t>An Inter-segment attack can flood the network with IT-type traffic with the intent of
            disrupting the handling of IT traffic and/or the goal of interfering with OT traffic.
            Presumably, if the DetNet flow reservation and isolation of the DetNet is well designed
            (better-designed than the attack), then interference with OT traffic should not result
            from an attack that floods the network with IT traffic. </t>
          <t>The handling of IT traffic (i.e., traffic that by definition is not guaranteed any
            given deterministic service properties) by the DetNet will by definition not be given
            the DetNet-specific protections provided to DetNet (resource-reserved) flows. The
            implication is that the IT traffic on the DetNet network will necessarily have its own
            specific set of product (component or system) requirements for protection against
            attacks such as DoS; presumably they will be less stringent than those for OT flows, but
            nonetheless, component and system designers must employ whatever mitigations will meet
            the specified security requirements for IT traffic for the given component or DetNet. </t>
          <t>The network design as a whole also needs to consider possible application-level
            dependencies of OT-type applications on services provided by the IT part of the network;
            for example, does the OT application depend on IT network services such as DNS or OAM?
            If such dependencies exist, how are malicious packet flows handled? Such considerations
            are typically outside the scope of DetNet proper, but nonetheless need to be addressed
            in the overall DetNet network design for a given use case.</t>

            may not have been designed to be sufficiently secure, or secure at all, against the
            sorts of attacks described in this document. Deployment of such a component on a DetNet

      <name>Security Considerations for OAM Traffic</name>
      <t>This section considers DetNet-specific security considerations for packet traffic that is
        generated and transmitted over a DetNet as part of OAM (Operations, Administration, and
        Maintenance). For the purposes of this discussion, OAM traffic falls into one of two basic
        types:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>OAM traffic generated by the network itself. The additional bandwidth required for such
          packets is added by the network administration, presumably transparent to the customer.
          Security considerations for such traffic are not DetNet specific (apart from such traffic
          being subject to the same DetNet-specific security considerations as any other DetNet data
          flow) and are thus not covered in this document.</li>
        <li>OAM traffic generated by the customer. From a DetNet security point of view, DetNet
          security considerations for such traffic are exactly the same as for any other customer
          data flows.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>From the perspective of an attack, OAM traffic is indistinguishable from DetNet traffic,
        and the network needs to be secure against injection, removal, or modification of traffic of
        any kind, including OAM traffic. A DetNet is sensitive to any form of packet injection,
        removal, or manipulation, and in this respect DetNet OAM traffic is no different. Techniques
        for securing a DetNet against these threats have been discussed elsewhere in this
        document.</t>

      <t>
        <xref target="ThreatSection" format="default"/>, <xref
        target="ThreatSection" format="title" />, describes threats that are
        independent of a DetNet implementation. This section considers threats
        specifically related to the IP- and MPLS-specific aspects of DetNet
        implementations. </t>
      <t>The primary security considerations for the data plane specifically
      are to maintain the integrity of the data and the delivery of the
      associated DetNet service traversing the DetNet network. </t>
      <t>The primary relevant differences between IP and MPLS implementations
      are in flow identification and OAM methodologies.</t>
      <t>As noted in <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"/>, DetNet
      operates at the IP layer <xref target="RFC8939" format="default"/> and
      delivers service over sub-layer technologies such as MPLS <xref
      target="RFC8964" format="default"/> and IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive
      Networking (TSN) <xref target="RFC9023" format="default"/>. Application
      flows can be protected through whatever means are provided by the layer
      and sub-layer technologies. For example, technology-specific encryption
      may be used for IP flows (IPsec <xref target="RFC4301"
      format="default"/>). For IP-over-Ethernet (Layer 2) flows using an
      underlying sub-net, MACsec <xref target="IEEE802.1AE-2018"
      format="default"/> may be appropriate. For some use cases, packet
      integrity protection without encryption may be sufficient. </t>
      <t>However, if the DetNet nodes cannot decrypt IPsec traffic, then
      DetNet flow identification for encrypted IP traffic flows must be
      performed in a different way than it would be for unencrypted IP DetNet
      flows. The DetNet IP data plane identifies unencrypted flows via a
      6-tuple that consists of two IP addresses, the transport protocol ID,
      two transport protocol port numbers, and the DSCP in the IP header. When
      IPsec is used, the transport header is encrypted and the next protocol
      ID is an IPsec protocol, usually Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP),
      and not a transport protocol, leaving only three components of the
      6-tuple, which are the two IP addresses and the DSCP. If the IPsec
      sessions are established by a controller, then this controller could
      also transmit (in the clear) the Security Parameter Index (SPI) and thus
      the SPI could be used (in addition to the pair of IP addresses) for flow
      identification. Identification of DetNet flows over IPsec is further
      discussed in <xref target="RFC8939" sectionFormat="of" section="5.1.2.3"
      format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Sections below discuss threats specific to IP and MPLS in more detail.</t>

      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>IP</name>
        <t>IP has a long history of security considerations and architectural protection mechanisms.
          From a data plane perspective, DetNet does not add or modify any IP header information, so
          the carriage of DetNet traffic over an IP data plane does not introduce any new security
          issues that were not there before, apart from those already described in the
          data-plane-independent threats section (<xref target="ThreatSection" format="default"/>). </t>
        <t>Thus, the security considerations for a DetNet based on an IP data plane are purely
          inherited from the rich IP security literature and code/application base, and the
          data-plane-independent section of this document. </t>
        <t>Maintaining security for IP segments of a DetNet may be more challenging than for the
          MPLS segments of the network given that the IP segments of the network may reach the edges
          of the network, which are more likely to involve interaction with potentially malevolent
          outside actors. Conversely, MPLS is inherently more secure than IP since it is internal to
          routers and it is well known how to protect it from outside influence. </t>
        <t>Another way to look at DetNet IP security is to consider it in the light of VPN security.
          As an industry, we have a lot of experience with VPNs running through networks with other
          VPNs -- it is well known how to secure the network for that. However, for a DetNet, we
          have the additional subtlety that any possible interaction of one packet with another can
          have a potentially deleterious effect on the time properties of the flows. So the network
          must provide sufficient isolation between flows, for example, by protecting the forwarding
          bandwidth and related resources so that they are available to DetNet traffic, by whatever
          means are appropriate for the data plane of that network, for example, through the use of
          queuing mechanisms. </t>
        <t>In a VPN, bandwidth is generally guaranteed over a period of time whereas in DetNet, it
          is not aggregated over time. This implies that any VPN-type protection mechanism must also
          maintain the DetNet timing constraints. </t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>MPLS</name>
        <t>An MPLS network carrying DetNet traffic is expected to be a "well-managed" network. Given
          that this is the case, it is difficult for an attacker to pass a raw MPLS-encoded packet
          into a network because operators have considerable experience at excluding such packets at
          the network boundaries as well as excluding MPLS packets being inserted through the use of
          a tunnel.</t>
        <t>MPLS security is discussed extensively in <xref target="RFC5920" format="default"/>
            ("<xref target="RFC5920" format="title"/>") to which the reader is referred. </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="RFC6941" format="default"/> builds on <xref target="RFC5920"
            format="default"/> by providing additional security considerations that are applicable
          to the MPLS-TP extensions appropriate to the MPLS Transport Profile <xref target="RFC5921"
            format="default"/> and thus to the operation of DetNet over some types of MPLS network. </t>

        <t>
          <xref target="RFC5921" format="default"/> introduces to MPLS new Operations,
          Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) capabilities; a transport-oriented path protection
          mechanism; and strong emphasis on static provisioning supported by network management
          systems. </t>
        <t>The operation of DetNet over an MPLS network builds on MPLS and pseudowire encapsulation.
          Thus, for guidance on securing the DetNet elements of DetNet over MPLS, the reader is also
          referred to the security considerations of <xref target="RFC4385" format="default"/>,
            <xref target="RFC5586" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC3985" format="default"/>,
            <xref target="RFC6073" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC6478" format="default"
          />. </t>
        <t>Having attended to the conventional aspects of network security, it is necessary to
          attend to the dynamic aspects. The closest experience that the IETF has with securing
          protocols that are sensitive to manipulation of delay are the two-way time transfer (TWTT)
          protocols, which are NTP <xref target="RFC5905" format="default"/> and the Precision Time
          Protocol <xref target="IEEE1588" format="default"/>. The security requirements for these
          are described in <xref target="RFC7384" format="default"/>. </t>
        <t>One particular problem that has been observed in operational tests of TWTT protocols is
          the ability for two closely but not completely synchronized flows to beat and cause a
          sudden phase hit to one of the flows. This can be mitigated by the careful use of a
          scheduling system in the underlying packet transport. </t>
        <t>Some investigations into protection of MPLS systems against dynamic attacks exist, such
          as <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-opportunistic-encrypt" format="default"/>; perhaps
          deployment of DetNets will encourage additional such investigations.</t>

      <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
      <t>Privacy in the context of DetNet is maintained by the base technologies specific to the
        DetNet and user traffic. For example, TSN can use MACsec, IP can use IPsec, and applications
        can use IP transport protocol-provided methods, e.g., TLS and DTLS. MPLS typically uses
        L2/L3 VPNs combined with the previously mentioned privacy methods. </t>
      <t>However, note that reconnaissance threats such as traffic analysis and monitoring of
        electrical side channels can still cause there to be privacy considerations even when
        traffic is encrypted.</t>
