      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>In scenarios where network configuration information becomes invalid without any explicit signaling of that condition (such as when a Customer Edge (CE) router crashes and reboots without knowledge of the previously employed configuration information), hosts on the local network will continue using stale information for an unacceptably long period of time, thus resulting in connectivity problems. This problem is documented in detail in <xref target="RFC8978" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>This document specifies improvements to CE routers that help mitigate the aforementioned problem for residential and small office scenarios. It specifies recommendations for the default behavior of CE routers but does not preclude the availability of configuration knobs that might allow an operator or user to manually configure the CE router to deviate from these recommendations. This document updates RFC 7084.

      <t>This section specifies and clarifies requirements for CE routers that can help mitigate the problem discussed in <xref target="intro" format="default"/>, particularly when they employ prefixes learned via DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) <xref target="RFC8415" format="default"/> on the WAN side with Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref target="RFC4862" format="default"/> or DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415" format="default"/> on the LAN side. The recommendations in this document help improve robustness at the CE router (on which the user or ISP may have no control) and do not preclude implementation of host-side improvements such as those specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-slaac-renum" format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>This document specifies additional WAN-side prefix-delegation (WPD) requirements to those specified in <xref target="RFC7084" format="default"/>:

      </t>

<dl>

<dt>WPD-9:</dt>
<dd>CE routers <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> automatically send DHCPv6-PD RELEASE
messages upon restart events. See <xref target="dhcpv6-release"
format="default"/> for further details.
</dd>

<dt>WPD-10:</dt>
<dd>CE routers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> by default use a WAN-side Identity
Association IDentifier (IAID) value that is stable between CE router restarts,
DHCPv6 client restarts, or interface state changes (e.g., transient PPP
interfaces), unless the CE router employs the IAID techniques discussed in
<xref target="RFC7844" sectionFormat="of" section="4.5" format="default"/>.
See <xref target="dhcpv6-iaid" format="default"/> for further details.
</dd>

</dl>

      <t>This document also replaces LAN-side requirement L-13 from <xref target="RFC7084" format="default"/> with:

</t>

<dl>
<dt>L-13:</dt>
<dd>CE routers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> signal stale configuration information as
specified in <xref target="sig-stale-config" format="default"/>.
</dd>

</dl>

      <t>Finally, this document specifies the following additional LAN-side requirements to those from <xref target="RFC7084" format="default"/>:

      </t>

<dl>  

<dt>L-15:</dt>
<dd>

CE routers <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> advertise prefixes via SLAAC or assign
addresses or delegate prefixes via DHCPv6 on the LAN side using lifetimes that
exceed the remaining lifetimes of the corresponding prefixes learned on the
WAN side via DHCPv6-PD.  For more details, see <xref target="dhcpv6-pd-slaac"
format="default"/>.
</dd>

<dt>L-16:
</dt>
<dd>CE routers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> advertise capped SLAAC option lifetimes,

        <t>
	  Some CE routers are known to automatically send DHCPv6-PD RELEASE
	  messages upon restart events. However, this may inadvertently
	  trigger a flash-renumbering scenario, along with the associated
	  problems discussed in <xref target="RFC8978" format="default"/>,
	  that this document attempts to mitigate.
	</t>
        <t>
As a result, requirement WPD-9 from <xref target="CPE" format="default"/>
specifies that CE routers <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> automatically send
DHCPv6-PD RELEASE messages upon restart events.
</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="dhcpv6-iaid" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Stability of IAIDs</name>
        <t>
   <xref target="RFC8415" format="default"/> requires that the IAID for an IA
   <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be consistent across restarts of the DHCP
   client. However, some popular CE routers are known to select new random
   IAIDs, e.g., every time the underlying PPP session is established or when
   the device is rebooted. This could be the result of extrapolating the
   behavior described in <xref target="RFC7844" format="default"/> or simply a
   consequence of not storing IAIDs on stable storage along with failure to
   employ an algorithm that consistently generates the same IAID upon
   reboots. Thus, requirement WPD-10 from <xref target="CPE"
   format="default"/> prevents CE routers from inadvertently triggering
   flash-renumbering events on the local network.

              lifetimes) are introduced. However, a number of scenarios may
              lead to the so-called "flash-renumbering" events, where a prefix
              being employed on a network suddenly becomes invalid and
              replaced by a new prefix <xref target="RFC8978"
              format="default"/>. One such scenario is when an Internet
              Service Provider (ISP) employs dynamic prefixes and the CE
              router crashes and reboots. The requirements in this section are
              meant to allow CE routers to deprecate stale information in such
              scenarios.
		</li>
              <li>The recommendations in this section expand from requirement
              L-13 in <xref target="RFC7084" sectionFormat="of" section="4.3"
              format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8415"
              sectionFormat="of" section="6.3" format="default"/>.</li>
              <li>Hosts configuring addresses via SLAAC on the local network
              may employ addresses configured for the previously advertised
              prefixes for at most the "Valid Lifetime" of the corresponding
              PIOs of the last received Router Advertisement messages. Since
              Router Advertisement messages may be lost or fail to be received
              for various reasons, CE routers need to try to
              deprecate stale prefixes for a period of time equal to the
              "Valid Lifetime" of the PIO employed when originally advertising
              the prefix.</li>
              <li>The requirements in this section to store information on
              stable storage are conveyed as "<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>" (as
              opposed to "<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>"), since they may represent a
              challenge for some implementations.</li>
              <li>Advertising DHCPv6-leased prefixes with zero lifetimes on
              the LAN side would handle the case where a CE router has no
              stable storage but receives the prefixes via DHCPv6 with 0
              lifetimes.</li>
              <li>The above text does not include DHCPv6 Advertise messages
              sent in response to DHCPv6 Solicit messages, since <xref
              target="RFC8415" sectionFormat="of" section="18.3.9"
              format="default"/> requires that a DHCPv6 server that is not
              going to assign an address or delegated prefix received as a
              hint in the Solicit message <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include that
              address or delegated prefix in the Advertise
              message. Additionally, any subsequent Request messages will
              trigger the response specified in this section and therefore
              cause the address or prefix to be deprecated.</li>
