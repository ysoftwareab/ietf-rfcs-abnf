    <abstract>
      <t>Encrypted Key Transport (EKT) is an extension to DTLS
(Datagram Transport Layer Security) and the Secure Real-time
Transport Protocol (SRTP) that provides for the secure
transport of SRTP master keys, rollover counters, and other
information within SRTP. This facility enables SRTP for decentralized
conferences by distributing a common key to all of the conference
endpoints.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is designed to allow decentralized
groups with minimal control to establish sessions, such as for
multimedia conferences.  Unfortunately, Secure RTP (SRTP) <xref target="RFC3711" format="default"/>
cannot be used in many minimal-control scenarios, because it requires
that synchronization source (SSRC) values and other data be
coordinated among all of the participants in a session. For example,
if a participant joins a session that is already in progress, that
participant needs to be informed of the SRTP keys along with the SSRC,
rollover counter (ROC), and other details of the other SRTP sources.
</t>
      <t>The inability of SRTP to work in the absence of central control was
well understood during the design of the protocol; the omission was
considered less important than optimizations such as bandwidth
conservation. Additionally, in many situations, SRTP is used in
conjunction with a signaling system that can provide the central
control needed by SRTP. However, there are several cases in which
conventional signaling systems cannot easily provide all of the
coordination required.
</t>
      <t>This document defines Encrypted Key Transport (EKT) for SRTP and
reduces the amount of external signaling control that is needed in an
SRTP session with multiple receivers. EKT securely distributes the
SRTP master key and other information for each SRTP source. With this
method, SRTP entities are free to choose SSRC values as they see fit
and to start up new SRTP sources with new SRTP master keys within a
session without coordinating with other entities via external signaling
or other external means.
</t>
      <t>EKT extends DTLS and SRTP to enable a common key encryption key
(called an "EKTKey") to be distributed to all endpoints, so that each
endpoint can securely send its SRTP master key and current SRTP
ROC to the other participants in the session. This data
furnishes the information needed by the receiver to instantiate an
SRTP receiver context.
</t>
      <t>EKT can be used in conferences where the central Media Distributor or
conference bridge cannot decrypt the media, such as the type defined
in <xref target="RFC8871" format="default"/>. It can also be used for
large-scale conferences where the conference bridge or Media
Distributor can decrypt all the media but wishes to encrypt the media
it is sending just once and then send the same encrypted media to a large
number of participants. This reduces encryption CPU time
in general and is necessary when sending multicast media.
</t>
      <t>EKT does not control the manner in which the SSRC is generated. It
is only concerned with distributing the security parameters that an
endpoint needs to associate with a given SSRC in order to decrypt
SRTP packets from that sender.
</t>
      <t>EKT is not intended to replace external key establishment
mechanisms. Instead, it is used in conjunction with those methods, and
it relieves those methods of the burden of delivering the context for
each SRTP source to every SRTP participant.  This document defines
how EKT works with the DTLS-SRTP approach to key establishment, by
using keys derived from the DTLS-SRTP handshake to encipher the
EKTKey in addition to the SRTP media.
</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="overview" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Overview</name>
      <t>This specification defines a way for the server in a DTLS-SRTP
negotiation (see <xref target="dtls-srtp-kt" format="default"/>) to provide an EKTKey to the client
during the DTLS handshake. The EKTKey thus obtained can be used to
encrypt the SRTP master key that is used to encrypt the media sent by
the endpoint. This specification also defines a way to send the
encrypted SRTP master key (with the EKTKey) along with the SRTP packet
(see <xref target="srtp_ekt" format="default"/>). Endpoints that receive this packet and know the EKTKey can use
the EKTKey to decrypt the SRTP master key, which can then be used to decrypt
the SRTP packet.
</t>
      <t>One way to use this specification is described in the architecture defined
by <xref target="RFC8871" format="default"/>. Each participant in the
conference forms a DTLS-SRTP connection to a common Key Distributor
that distributes the same EKTKey to all the endpoints.
Then, each endpoint picks its own SRTP master key for the media
it sends. When sending media, the endpoint may also include the
SRTP master key encrypted with the EKTKey in the SRTP packet.
This allows all the endpoints to decrypt the media.

      <t>EKT defines a new method of providing SRTP master keys to an
endpoint. In order to convey the ciphertext corresponding to the SRTP
master key, and other additional information, an additional field,
called the "EKTField", is added to the SRTP packets. The EKTField appears
at the end of the SRTP packet. It appears after the optional
authentication tag, if one is present; otherwise, the EKTField
appears after the ciphertext portion of the packet.
</t>
      <t>EKT <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used in conjunction with SRTP's MKI (Master Key
Identifier) or with SRTP's &lt;From, To&gt; <xref target="RFC3711" format="default"/>, as those SRTP
features duplicate some of the functions of EKT. Senders <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
include the MKI when using EKT. Receivers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> simply ignore any MKI
field received if EKT is in use.
</t>
      <t>This document defines the use of EKT with SRTP.  Its use with the
      Secure Real-time Transport Control Protocol (SRTCP)
would be similar, but that topic is left for a future specification.  SRTP
is preferred for transmitting keying material because (1)&nbsp;it shares fate
with the transmitted media, (2)&nbsp;SRTP rekeying can occur without
concern for RTCP transmission limits, and (3)&nbsp;it avoids the need
for SRTCP compound packets with RTP translators and mixers.

            <li>The final byte is checked to determine which EKT format is in

the SRTP part is not known until the decryption has
occurred. At this point in the processing, there is no easy way to

</t>
          <t><xref target="outbound-processing" format="default"/> recommends that SRTP senders continue using
an old key for some time after sending a new key in an EKT Tag.
Receivers that wish to avoid packet loss due to decryption failures
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> perform trial decryption with both the old key and the new key,
keeping the result of whichever decryption succeeds.  Note that this

integrity protection.

          <t>When receiving a new EKTKey, implementations need to use the
ekt_ttl field (see <xref target="ekt_key" format="default"/>)
to create a time after which this key cannot be used, and they also
need to create a counter that keeps track of how many times the key
has been used to encrypt data, to ensure that it does not exceed the T value
for that cipher (see <xref target="cipher" format="default"/>). If either of
these limits is exceeded,
the key can no longer be used for encryption. At this point, implementations
need to either use call signaling to renegotiate a new session
or terminate the existing session.  Terminating the session is a
reasonable implementation choice because these limits should not be
exceeded, except under an attack or error condition.

        <t>EKT uses an authenticated cipher to encrypt and authenticate the
EKTPlaintext.  This specification defines the interface to the cipher,
in order to abstract the interface away from the details of that
function. This specification also defines the default cipher that is
used in EKT. The default cipher described in <xref target="DefaultCipher" format="default"/> <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
be implemented, but another cipher that conforms to this interface
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used.  The cipher used for a given EKTCiphertext value is
negotiated using the supported_ekt_ciphers extension (see <xref target="dtls-srtp-extensions"/>) and indicated with the

</t>
        <t>An EKTCipher consists of an encryption function and a decryption
function. The encryption function E(K, P) takes the following inputs:
</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>a secret key K with a length of L bytes, and</li>
          <li>a plaintext value P with a length of M bytes.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The encryption function returns a ciphertext value C whose length is N
bytes, where N may be larger than M. The decryption function D(K,&nbsp;C)
takes the following inputs:
</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>a secret key K with a length of L bytes, and</li>
          <li>a ciphertext value C with a length of N bytes.</li>

        <t>The decryption function returns a plaintext value P that is M bytes
long, or it returns an indication that the decryption operation failed
because the ciphertext was invalid (i.e., it was not generated by the
encryption of plaintext with the key K).
</t>
        <t>These functions have the property that D(K, E(K, P)) = P for all
values of K and P. Each cipher also has a limit T on the number of
times that it can be used with any fixed key value.  The EKTKey <bcp14>MUST
NOT</bcp14> be used for encryption more than T times.  Note that if the same
FullEKTField is retransmitted three times, that only counts as one
encryption.

        <name>Timing and Reliability Considerations</name>
        <t>A system using EKT learns the SRTP master keys distributed with
the FullEKTField sent with SRTP, rather than with call signaling.
 A
receiver can immediately decrypt an SRTP packet, provided the SRTP
packet contains a FullEKTField.
</t>
        <t>This section describes how to reliably and expediently deliver new
SRTP master keys to receivers.
</t>
        <t>There are three cases to consider. In the first case, a new
        sender joins a session and needs to communicate its SRTP
        master key to all the receivers.  In the second case, a sender
        changes its SRTP master key, which needs to be communicated to all
        the receivers. In the third case, a new receiver joins a session
        already in progress and needs to know the sender's SRTP
        master key.
</t>
<t>The three cases are as follows:</t>
        <dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
          <dt>New sender:</dt>
          <dd>
A new sender <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send a packet containing the
FullEKTField as soon as possible, ideally in its initial SRTP packet.  To accommodate packet loss, it is
<bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the FullEKTField be transmitted in three consecutive packets.
If the sender does not send a FullEKTField in its
initial packets and receivers have not otherwise been provisioned
with a decryption key, then decryption will fail and SRTP packets
will be dropped until the receiver receives a FullEKTField from the
sender.</dd>
          <dt>Rekey:</dt>
          <dd>
By sending an EKT Tag over SRTP, the rekeying event shares fate with the
SRTP packets protected with that new SRTP master key. To accommodate
packet loss, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that three consecutive packets
containing the FullEKTField be transmitted.</dd>
          <dt>New receiver:</dt>
          <dd>
When a new receiver joins a session, it does not need to communicate
its sending SRTP master key (because it is a receiver). Also, when a new
receiver joins a session, the sender is generally unaware of the
receiver joining the session; thus, senders <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> periodically
transmit the FullEKTField. That interval depends on how frequently new
receivers join the session, the acceptable delay before those
receivers can start processing SRTP packets, and the acceptable
overhead of sending the FullEKTField. If sending audio and video, the
<bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> frequency is the same as the rate of intra-coded video
frames. If only sending audio, the <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> frequency is every
100&nbsp;ms.</dd>
        </dl>
        <t>If none of the above three cases apply, a ShortEKTField <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be sent.
        </t>

        <t>
In general, sending FullEKTField tags less frequently will consume less
bandwidth but will increase the time it takes for a join or rekey to
take effect.  Applications should schedule the sending of FullEKTField tags in
a way that makes sense for their bandwidth and latency requirements.

      <name>Use of EKT with DTLS-SRTP</name>
      <t>This document defines an extension to DTLS-SRTP called "SRTP EKTKey
Transport", which enables secure transport of EKT keying material from
the DTLS-SRTP peer in the server role to the client. This allows
such a peer to process EKT keying material in SRTP and
retrieve the embedded SRTP keying material.
  This combination of
protocols is valuable because it combines the advantages of DTLS,
which has strong authentication of the endpoint and flexibility,
along with allowing secure multi-party RTP with loose coordination
and efficient communication of per-source keys.
</t>
      <t>In cases where the DTLS termination point is more trusted than the

      <t>SRTP master keys <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be randomly generated, and <xref target="RFC4086" format="default"/> offers
some guidance about random number generation. SRTP master keys <bcp14>MUST
NOT</bcp14> be reused for any other purpose, and SRTP master keys <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be
derived from other SRTP master keys.
</t>
      <t>The EKT Cipher includes its own authentication/integrity check.
</t>
      <t>The presence of the SSRC in the EKTPlaintext ensures that an attacker
cannot substitute an EKTCiphertext from one SRTP stream into another
SRTP stream.  This mitigates the impact of cut-and-paste attacks
that arise due to the lack of a cryptographic binding between the
EKT Tag and the rest of the SRTP packet.  SRTP tags can only be
cut-and-pasted within the stream of packets sent by a given RTP
endpoint; an attacker cannot "cross the streams" and use an EKT Tag
from one SSRC to reset the key for another SSRC.  The Epoch field
in the FullEKTField also prevents an attacker from rolling back to a
previous key.
</t>
      <t>An attacker could send packets containing a FullEKTField, in an
attempt to consume additional CPU resources of the receiving system by
causing the receiving system to decrypt the EKT ciphertext and
detect an authentication failure. In some cases, caching the previous
values of the ciphertext as described in <xref target="inbound-processing" format="default"/> helps
mitigate this issue.
</t>
      <t>In a similar vein, EKT has no replay protection, so an attacker
could implant improper keys in receivers by capturing EKTCiphertext
values encrypted with a given EKTKey and replaying them in a
different context, e.g., from a different sender.  When the
underlying SRTP transform provides integrity protection, this attack
will just result in packet loss.  If it does not, then it will
result in random data being fed to RTP payload processing.  An
attacker that is in a position to mount these attacks, however,
could achieve the same effects more easily without attacking EKT.
</t>
      <t>The key encryption keys distributed with EKTKey messages are group
shared symmetric keys, which means they do not provide protection
within the group.  Group members can impersonate each other; for
example, any group member can generate an EKT Tag for any SSRC.  The
entity that distributes EKTKeys can decrypt any keys distributed
using EKT and thus any media protected with those keys.
</t>
      <t>Each EKT Cipher specifies a value T that is the maximum number of
times a given key can be used. An endpoint <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> encrypt more than
T different FullEKTField values using the same EKTKey. In addition, the
EKTKey <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used beyond the lifetime provided by the TTL
described in <xref target="dtls-srtp-extensions" format="default"/>.
</t>
      <t>The key length of the EKT Cipher
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be at least as long as the SRTP cipher and at least as long
as the DTLS-SRTP ciphers.
</t>
      <t>Part of the EKTPlaintext is known or is easily guessable to an
attacker. Thus, the EKT Cipher <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> resist known plaintext attacks. In
practice, this requirement does not impose any restrictions on our
choices, since the ciphers in use provide high security even when much
plaintext is known.
</t>
      <t>An EKT Cipher <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> resist attacks in which both ciphertexts and
plaintexts can be adaptively chosen by an attacker querying both
the encryption and decryption functions.
</t>
      <t>In some systems, when a member of a conference leaves the conference,
that conference is rekeyed so that the member who left the conference no longer has the key. When
changing to a new EKTKey, it is possible that the attacker could block
the EKTKey message getting to a particular endpoint and that endpoint
would keep sending media encrypted using the old key. To mitigate that
risk, the lifetime of the EKTKey <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be limited by using the ekt_ttl.
