      <t>
        This specification defines a new Session Description
        Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework extension called 'BUNDLE'. 
        The extension can be used with the SDP offer/answer mechanism 
        to negotiate the usage of a single transport (5-tuple) for 
        sending and receiving media described by multiple SDP media descriptions 
        ("m=" sections). Such transport is referred to as a BUNDLE transport, 
        and the media is referred to as bundled media. The "m=" sections that
        use the BUNDLE transport form a BUNDLE group.

        <t>
        When the SDP offer/answer mechanism <xref format="default" target="RFC3264"/>  
        is used to negotiate the establishment of multimedia communication sessions, if separate 
        transports (5-tuples) are negotiated for each individual media stream, each transport consumes 
        additional resources (especially when Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
        <xref format="default" target="RFC8445"/> is used). 
        For this reason, it is attractive to use a single transport for multiple media streams.

        <name>BUNDLE Mechanism</name>
        <t>
        This specification defines a way to use a single transport (BUNDLE transport) 
        for sending and receiving media (bundled media) described by multiple SDP media descriptions 
        ("m=" sections). The address:port combination used by an endpoint for sending and receiving 
        bundled media is referred to as the BUNDLE address:port. The set of SDP attributes that are 
        applied to each "m=" section within a BUNDLE group is referred to as BUNDLE attributes. 
        The same BUNDLE transport is used for sending and receiving bundled media, which
        means that the symmetric Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) mechanism <xref format="default" target="RFC4961"/> is always used for RTP-based bundled media.
        </t>

        <t>
        This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework <xref format="default" target="RFC5888"/> extension called 'BUNDLE'. The extension can be used with the Session Description
        Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism <xref format="default" target="RFC3264"/>
        to negotiate which "m=" sections will become part of a BUNDLE group. In addition, the offerer and 
        answerer <xref format="default" target="RFC3264"/> use the BUNDLE extension to negotiate 
        the BUNDLE addresses:ports (offerer BUNDLE address:port and answerer BUNDLE address:port) and the 
        set of BUNDLE attributes (offerer BUNDLE attributes and answerer BUNDLE attributes) that will be applied to
        each "m=" section within the BUNDLE group.
        </t>

        <t>
        The use of a BUNDLE transport allows the usage of a single set of
        ICE <xref format="default" target="RFC8445"/> candidates for the whole BUNDLE group.
        </t>
        <t>
        A given BUNDLE address:port <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only be associated with a single BUNDLE group. If an SDP offer 
        or SDP answer (hereafter referred to as "offer" and "answer") contains multiple BUNDLE groups, the procedures in this specification apply to each 
        group independently. All RTP-based bundled media associated with a given BUNDLE group belong to a single
        RTP session <xref format="default" target="RFC3550"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
        The BUNDLE extension is backward compatible. Endpoints that do not support the extension
        are expected to generate offers and answers without an SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute and
        assign a unique address:port to each "m=" section within an offer and answer, according
        to the procedures in
       <xref format="default" target="RFC3264"/> and <xref format="default" target="RFC4566"/>.

        <name>Protocol Extensions</name>
        <t>
        In addition to defining the new SDP Grouping Framework extension, this specification defines
        the following protocol extensions and RFC updates.  This specification:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
          defines a new SDP attribute, 'bundle-only', which can be used to

          within a BUNDLE group.
        </li>
          <li>  
          updates RFC 3264 <xref format="default" target="RFC3264"/>, to also allow assigning a zero port value to an "m=" section 
          in cases where the media described by the "m=" section is not disabled or rejected.
        </li>
          <li>
          defines a new RTCP <xref format="default" target="RFC3550"/> SDES item, 'MID', and a new RTP SDES header
          extension that can be used to associate RTP streams with "m=" sections.
        </li>
          <li>
          updates <xref format="default" target="RFC7941"/> by adding an exception,
          for the MID RTP header extension, to the requirement regarding protection 
          of an SDES RTP header extension carrying an SDES item for the MID RTP 
          header extension.

<name>Contradiction regarding bundle-only "m=" sections</name>
<t>
  Since the approval of the WebRTC specification documents, the IETF has become
  aware of an inconsistency between the document specifying JSEP and the
  document specifying BUNDLE (RFC 8829 and this RFC, respectively).  Rather than
  delaying publication further to come to a resolution, the documents are being
  published as they were originally approved.  The IETF intends to restart work
  on these technologies, and revised versions of these documents will be
  published as soon as a resolution becomes available.
</t>
<t>
  The specific issue involves the handling of "m=" sections that are designated
  as bundle-only, as discussed in <xref target="RFC8829" section="4.1.1"
  sectionFormat="comma"/>. Currently, there is divergence between JSEP and
  BUNDLE, as well as between these specifications and existing browser
  implementations:
</t>
<ul>
  <li>JSEP prescribes that said "m=" sections should use port zero and add an "a=bundle-only" attribute in initial offers, but not in answers or subsequent offers.
  </li>
  <li>BUNDLE prescribes that these "m=" sections should be marked as described in the previous point, but in all offers and answers.
  </li>
  <li>Most current browsers do not mark any "m=" sections with port zero and instead use the same port for all bundled "m=" sections; some others follow the JSEP behavior.
  </li>
</ul>

      <t>
       This section defines a new SDP Grouping Framework <xref format="default" target="RFC5888"/> extension, 'BUNDLE'. The BUNDLE extension can be used with the SDP
       offer/answer mechanism to negotiate a set of "m=" sections that will become part of a BUNDLE 
       group. Within a BUNDLE group, each "m=" section uses a BUNDLE transport for sending and 
       receiving bundled media. Each endpoint uses a single address:port combination for sending and
       receiving the bundled media.
      </t>
      <t>
       The BUNDLE extension is indicated using an SDP 'group' attribute with a semantics value 
       <xref format="default" target="RFC5888"/> of "BUNDLE".
       An identification-tag is assigned to each bundled
       "m=" section, and each identification-tag is listed in the SDP 'group:BUNDLE'
       attribute identification-tag list. Each "m=" section whose identification-tag
       is listed in the identification-tag list is associated with a given
       BUNDLE group.
      </t>
      <t>
       SDP bodies can contain multiple BUNDLE groups. Any given bundled "m="

       time.

      <t>
      In order to ensure that an answerer that does not support the BUNDLE extension always

      section. According to <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/>, an answerer
      will reject such an "m=" section.
      By including an SDP 'bundle-only' attribute in a bundled "m=" section, the offerer can
      request that the answerer accepts the "m=" section only if the answerer supports the BUNDLE
      extension and if the answerer keeps the "m=" section within the associated BUNDLE group.

            Multiple bundled "m=" sections might describe RTP-based media. As all RTP-based
            media associated with a BUNDLE group belong to the same RTP session, in order

        <name>Associating RTP/RTCP Streams with the Correct SDP Media Description</name>
        <t>
            As described in <xref target="RFC3550" format="default"/>, RTP packets are associated with RTP
            streams <xref target="RFC7656" format="default"/>. Each RTP stream is identified by an SSRC
            value, and each RTP packet includes an SSRC field that is
            used to associate the packet with the correct RTP stream.
            RTCP packets also use SSRCs to identify which RTP streams the
            packet relates to. However, an RTCP packet can contain multiple SSRC
            fields, in the course of providing feedback or reports on different RTP
            streams, and therefore can be associated with multiple such streams.
        </t>
        <t>
            In order to be able to process received RTP/RTCP packets
            correctly, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be possible to associate an RTP stream with
            the correct "m=" section, as the "m=" section and SDP attributes
            associated with the "m=" section contains information needed to
            process the packets.
        </t>
        <t>
            As all RTP streams associated with a BUNDLE group use the
            same transport for sending and receiving RTP/RTCP
            packets, the local address:port combination part of the transport
            cannot be used to associate an RTP stream with the correct "m=" section. 
            In addition, multiple RTP streams might be associated with the same "m="
            section.
        </t>
        <t>
            An offerer and answerer can inform each other which SSRC
            values they will use for an RTP stream by using the SDP 'ssrc'
            attribute <xref format="default" target="RFC5576"/>.
            However, an offerer will not know which SSRC values the
            answerer will use until the offerer has received the answer
            providing that information. Due to this, before the offerer has
            received the answer, the offerer will not be able to associate
            an RTP stream with the correct "m=" section using the SSRC value
            associated with the RTP stream. In addition, the offerer and
            answerer may start using new SSRC values mid-session, without
            informing each other about using the SDP 'ssrc' attribute.
        </t>
        <t>
            In order for an offerer and answerer to always be able to
            associate an RTP stream with the correct "m=" section, the offerer
            and answerer using the BUNDLE extension <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support the
            mechanism defined in <xref format="default" target="sec-receiver-id"/>, 
            where the offerer and answerer insert the identification-tag associated 
            with an "m=" section (provided by the remote peer) into RTP and RTCP 
            packets associated with a BUNDLE group.
        </t>
        <t>
             When using this mechanism, the mapping from an SSRC to an
             identification-tag is carried in RTP header extensions or RTCP SDES
             packets, as specified in <xref format="default" target="sec-receiver-id"/>. 
             Since a compound RTCP packet can contain multiple RTCP SDES packets, 
             and each RTCP SDES packet can contain multiple chunks, a single RTCP 
             packet can contain several mappings of SSRC to identification-tag. The 
             offerer and answerer maintain tables used for routing that are updated 
             each time an RTP/RTCP packet contains new information that affects how 
             packets are to be routed.
        </t>
        <t>
            However, some legacy implementations may not include this identification-tag
            in their RTP and RTCP traffic when using the BUNDLE mechanism and
            instead use a mechanism based on the payload type to associate RTP streams
            with SDP "m=" sections.  In this situation, each "m=" section needs to
            use unique payload type values, in order for the payload type to be a
            reliable indicator of the relevant "m=" section for the RTP stream. If an
            implementation fails to ensure unique payload type values, it will be 
            impossible to associate the RTP stream using that payload type value
            to a particular "m=" section. 
            Note that when using the payload type to associate RTP streams with
            "m=" sections, an RTP stream, identified by its SSRC, will be mapped
            to an "m=" section when the first packet of that RTP stream is
            received, and the mapping will not be changed even if the payload
            type used by that RTP stream changes.  In other words, the SSRC
            cannot "move" to a different "m=" section simply by changing the
            payload type.
        </t>
        <t>
             Applications can implement RTP stacks in many different
             ways. The algorithm below details one way that RTP streams can be
             associated with "m=" sections, but it is not meant to be prescriptive
             about exactly how an RTP stack needs to be implemented.
             Applications <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use any algorithm that achieves equivalent results to
             those described in the algorithm below.

             To prepare to associate RTP streams with the correct

        </t>
 
        <ul empty="false" spacing="normal">
          <li>
                 Construct a table mapping a MID to an "m=" section for each "m="

          <li>
                 Construct a table mapping the SSRC of each outgoing RTP stream

                 type is configured for receiving in more than one "m=" section
                 in the BUNDLE group, do not include it in the table, as it
                 cannot be used to uniquely identify an "m=" section.
             </li>
          <li>
                 Note that for each of these tables, there can only be one
                 mapping for any given key (MID, SSRC, or PT). In other
                 words, the tables are not multimaps.
             </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
             As "m=" sections are added or removed from the BUNDLE groups, or

             updated.
        </t>
        <t>
             When an RTP packet is received, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be delivered to the RTP
             stream corresponding to its SSRC. That RTP stream <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> then be
             associated with the correct "m=" section within a BUNDLE group, for
             additional processing, according to the following steps:
        </t>
        <ul empty="false" spacing="normal">
          <li>
                 If the MID associated with the RTP stream is not in the
                 table mapping a MID to an "m=" section, then the RTP stream is not
                 decoded and the payload data is discarded.
             </li>
          <li>
                 If the packet has a MID, and the packet's extended sequence number
                 is greater than that of the last MID update, as discussed in
                 <xref target="RFC7941" sectionFormat="comma" section="4.2.2"/>, update the MID associated
                 with the RTP stream to match the MID carried in the RTP packet, and then
                 update the mapping tables to include an entry that maps the SSRC of
                 that RTP stream to the "m=" section for that MID.
             </li>
          <li>
                 If the SSRC of the RTP stream is in the incoming SSRC
                 mapping table, check that the payload type used by the RTP
                 stream matches a payload type included on the matching
                 "m=" section. If so, associate the RTP stream with that
                 "m=" section. Otherwise, the RTP stream is not decoded and the
                 payload data is discarded.
             </li>
          <li>
                 If the payload type used by the RTP stream is in the
                 payload type table, update the incoming SSRC mapping table
                 to include an entry that maps the RTP stream's SSRC to the
                 "m=" section for that payload type. Associate the RTP stream
                 with the corresponding "m=" section.
             </li>
          <li>
                 Otherwise, mark the RTP stream as "not for decoding" and

             </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
           If the RTP packet contains one or more Contributing Source (CSRC)
           identifiers, then each CSRC is looked up in the incoming SSRC table,
           and a copy of the RTP packet is associated with the corresponding
           "m=" section for additional processing.
        </t>
        <t>
              For each RTCP packet received (including each RTCP packet that is
              part of a compound RTCP packet), the packet is processed as usual by
              the RTP layer, then associated with the appropriate "m=" sections, and
              processed for the RTP streams represented by those "m=" sections.
              This routing is type dependent, as each kind of RTCP packet has its own 
              mechanism for associating it with the relevant RTP streams.
        </t>
        <t>
              RTCP packets that cannot be associated with an appropriate "m=" section
              <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> still be processed as usual by the RTP layer, which updates the metadata
              associated with the corresponding RTP streams. This situation can occur with 
              certain multiparty RTP topologies or when RTCP packets are sent containing 
              a subset of the SDES information.
        </t>
        <t>
              Additional rules for processing various types of RTCP packets are
              explained below.

        <ul empty="false" spacing="normal">
          <li>
                If the RTCP packet is of type SDES, for each chunk in the packet
                whose SSRC is found in the incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy
                of the SDES packet to the "m=" section associated with that SSRC.
                In addition, for any SDES MID items contained in these chunks,
                if the MID is found in the table mapping a MID to an "m=" section,
                update the incoming SSRC table to include an entry that
                maps the RTP stream associated with the chunk's SSRC to the "m=" section 
                associated with that MID, unless the packet is older than the packet 
                that most recently updated the mapping for this SSRC, as discussed in
                <xref target="RFC7941" sectionFormat="comma" section="4.2.6"/>.
            </li>
          <li>
                Note that if an SDES packet is received as part of a compound RTCP
                packet, the SSRC to "m=" section mapping might not exist until the
                SDES packet is handled (e.g., in the case where RTCP for a source
                is received before any RTP packets). Therefore, it can be beneficial 
                for an implementation to delay RTCP packet routing, such that it 
                either prioritizes processing of the SDES item to generate or update 
                the mapping or buffers the RTCP information that needs to be 
                routed until the SDES item(s) has been processed. If the 
                implementation is unable to follow this recommendation, the 
                consequence could be that some RTCP information from this 
                particular RTCP compound packet is not provided to higher layers.
                The impact from this is likely minor, when this information relates 
                to a future incoming RTP stream.
            </li>
          <li>
                If the RTCP packet is of type BYE, it indicates that the RTP streams
                referenced in the packet are ending. Therefore, for each SSRC
                indicated in the packet that is found in the incoming SSRC table,
                first deliver a copy of the BYE packet to the "m=" section associated
                with that SSRC, and then remove the entry for that SSRC from the
                incoming SSRC table after an appropriate delay to
                account for "straggler packets", as specified in <xref target="RFC3550" sectionFormat="comma" section="6.2.1"/>.
            </li>
          <li>
                If the RTCP packet is of type Sender Report (SR) or Receiver Report (RR), for each report block in
                the report whose "SSRC of source" is found in the outgoing
                SSRC table, deliver a copy of the SR or RR packet to the "m=" section
                associated with that SSRC. In addition, if the packet is of type
                SR, and the sender SSRC for the packet is found in the
                incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy of the SR packet to the "m=" section

          <li>
                If the implementation supports the RTCP Extended Report (XR) and the packet is of
                type XR, as defined in <xref target="RFC3611" format="default"/>,
                for each report block in the report whose "SSRC of source"
                is found in the outgoing SSRC table, deliver a copy of the
                XR packet to the "m=" section associated with that SSRC.
                In addition, if the sender SSRC for the packet is found in the
                incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy of the XR packet to the "m=" section

                media source SSRC, and this SSRC is used for routing certain
                subtypes of feedback messages. However, several subtypes of
                PSFB and RTPFB messages include a target SSRC(s) in a section called

        This section describes how to use the BUNDLE grouping extension together
        with the ICE mechanism <xref format="default" target="RFC8445"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The generic procedures for negotiating the usage of ICE using SDP, defined
        in <xref target="RFC8839" format="default"/>, also apply to the usage of ICE
        with BUNDLE, with the following exceptions:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
            When the BUNDLE transport has been established, ICE connectivity checks and keepalives 
            only need to be performed for the BUNDLE transport, instead of per individual bundled "m=" section 
            within the BUNDLE group.
          </li>
        <li>
            The generic SDP attribute offer/answer considerations (<xref format="default" target="sec-sdp-oa-cat"/>) also apply to ICE-related 
            attributes. Therefore, when an offerer sends an initial BUNDLE offer (in order to negotiate a BUNDLE group), the offerer
            includes ICE-related media-level attributes in each bundled "m=" section (excluding any bundle-only "m=" sections),
            and each "m=" section <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain unique ICE properties. When an answerer generates an answer (initial BUNDLE answer or subsequent) 
            that contains a BUNDLE group, and when an offerer sends a subsequent offer that contains a BUNDLE group, ICE-related media-level 
            attributes are only included in the tagged "m=" section (suggested offerer-tagged "m=" section or answerer-tagged "m=" section), and
            the ICE properties are applied to each bundled "m=" section within the BUNDLE group.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
        NOTE: Most ICE-related media-level SDP attributes belong to the TRANSPORT multiplexing category
        <xref target="RFC8859" format="default"/>, and the generic SDP attribute offer/answer
        considerations for the TRANSPORT multiplexing category apply to the attributes. However, in the case of
        ICE-related attributes, the same considerations also apply to ICE-related media-level attributes that
        belong to other multiplexing categories.
      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE: The following ICE-related media-level SDP attributes are defined in
        <xref target="RFC8839" format="default"/>: 'candidate', 'remote-candidates', 'ice-mismatch',
        'ice-ufrag', 'ice-pwd', and 'ice-pacing'.
      </t>
      <t>
        Initially, before ICE has produced selected candidate pairs that will be used for media, there might
        be multiple transports established (if multiple candidate pairs are tested). Once ICE has selected
        candidate pairs, they form the BUNDLE transport.
      </t>
      <t>
        Support and usage of the ICE mechanism together with the BUNDLE extension
        is <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>, and the procedures in this section only apply when the
        ICE mechanism is used. Note that applications might mandate usage
        of the ICE mechanism even if the BUNDLE extension is not used.
      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE: If the Trickle ICE mechanism <xref target="RFC8840" format="default"/>
        is used, an offerer and answerer might assign a port value of '9' and an IPv4 
        address of '0.0.0.0' (or, the IPv6 equivalent '::') to multiple bundled "m=" sections
        in the initial BUNDLE offer. The offerer and answerer will follow the normal procedures
        for generating the offers and answers, including picking a bundled "m=" section as the
        suggested offerer-tagged "m=" section, selecting the tagged "m=" sections, etc. The only
        difference is that media cannot be sent until one or more candidates have been provided.
        Once a BUNDLE group has been negotiated, trickled candidates associated with a bundled
        "m=" section will be applied to all bundled "m=" sections within the BUNDLE group.

          Each usage of the DTLS association within the BUNDLE

          whether an offer or answer will trigger the
          establishment of a new DTLS association or
          an existing DTLS association will be used; and
        </li>

        <li>
          If the DTLS client supports DTLS-SRTP,
          it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the 'use_srtp' extension
          in the DTLS ClientHello message
          <xref format="default" target="RFC5764"/>.
          The client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the extension even if the usage

      </ul>
      <t>
        NOTE: The inclusion of the 'use_srtp' extension during the initial

      <name>RTP/RTCP Extensions for identification-tag Transport</name>
      <t>
        Offerers and answerers <xref format="default" target="RFC3264"/>
        can associate identification-tags with "m=" sections within offers
        and answers, using the procedures in <xref format="default" target="RFC5888"/>. Each identification-tag uniquely represents an "m=" section.
      </t>
      <t>
        This section defines a new RTCP SDES item <xref format="default" target="RFC3550"/>, 'MID', which is used to carry identification-tags within RTCP
        SDES packets. This section also defines a new RTP SDES header extension
        <xref format="default" target="RFC7941"/>, which
        is used to carry the 'MID' RTCP SDES item in RTP packets.
      </t>
      <t>
        The SDES item and RTP SDES header extension make it possible for a receiver to associate
        each RTP stream with a specific "m=" section, with which the receiver has
        associated an identification-tag, even if those "m=" sections are part of the same RTP session.
        The RTP SDES header extension also ensures that the media recipient gets the identification-tag
        upon receipt of the first decodable media and is able to associate the media with the
        correct application.
      </t>
      <t>
        A media recipient informs the media sender about the identification-tag
        associated with an "m=" section through the use of a 'id' attribute
        <xref format="default" target="RFC5888"/>. The media sender then
        inserts the identification-tag in RTCP and RTP packets sent to the media recipient.
      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE: The text above defines how identification-tags are carried in offers
        and answers. The usage of other signaling protocols for carrying identification-tags
        is not prevented, but the usage of such protocols is outside the scope of this document.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref format="default" target="RFC3550"/> defines general procedures
        regarding the RTCP transmission interval. The RTCP MID SDES item <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be sent in
        the first few RTCP packets after joining the session and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be sent regularly
        thereafter. The exact number of RTCP packets in which this SDES item is sent is
        intentionally not specified here, as it will depend on the expected packet-loss
        rate, the RTCP reporting interval, and the allowable overhead.
      </t>
      <t>
        The RTP SDES header extension for carrying the 'MID' RTCP SDES <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be included
        in some RTP packets at the start of the session and whenever the SSRC changes. It might
        also be useful to include the header extension in RTP packets that comprise access points in the media
        (e.g., with video I-frames). The exact number of RTP packets in which this header
        extension is sent is intentionally not specified here, as it will depend on expected
        packet-loss rate and loss patterns, the overhead the application can tolerate, and
        the importance of immediate receipt of the identification-tag.
      </t>
      <t>
        For robustness, endpoints need to be prepared for situations where the
        reception of the identification-tag is delayed and <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> terminate sessions
        in such cases, as the identification-tag is likely to arrive soon.

          The payload, containing the identification-tag, of the RTP SDES header extension element
          can be encoded using either the 1-byte or the 2-byte header <xref format="default" target="RFC7941"/>. The identification-tag payload is UTF-8
          encoded, as in SDP.
        </t>
        <t>
          The identification-tag is not zero terminated. Note that the set of header extensions
          included in the packet needs to be padded to the next 32-bit boundary using zero
          bytes <xref format="default" target="RFC8285"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          As the identification-tag is included in an RTCP SDES item, an RTP SDES header
          extension, or both, there needs to be some consideration about the packet expansion
          caused by the identification-tag. To avoid Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) issues
          for the RTP packets, the header extension's size needs to be taken into account when
          encoding the media.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is recommended that the identification-tag be kept short. Due to the properties of
          the RTP header extension mechanism, when using the 1-byte header, a tag that is 1-3 bytes
          will result in a minimal number of 32-bit words used for the RTP SDES header extension,
          in case no other header extensions are included at the same time. Note, do take into
          account that some single characters when UTF-8 encoded will result in multiple octets.
          The identification-tag <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> contain any user information, and applications <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> avoid 
          generating the identification-tag using a pattern that enables user or application 
          identification.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The security considerations defined in <xref format="default" target="RFC3264"/> and <xref format="default" target="RFC5888"/> apply to the BUNDLE extension. BUNDLE
      does not change which information, e.g., RTP streams, flows over
      the network, with the exception of the usage of the MID SDES item as
      discussed below.
      Primarily, it changes which addresses and ports, and
      thus in which (RTP) sessions, the information flows to. This
      affects the security contexts being used and can cause previously
      separated information flows to share the same security context. This has very
      little impact on the performance of the security mechanism of the RTP
      sessions. In cases where one would have applied different security
      policies on the different RTP streams being bundled, or where the
      parties having access to the security contexts would have differed
      between the RTP streams, additional analysis of the implications are
      needed before selecting to apply BUNDLE.</t>

      <t>The identification-tag, independent of transport, RTCP SDES packet, or
      RTP header extension, can expose the value to parties beyond the
      signaling chain. Therefore, the identification-tag values <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
      generated in a fashion that does not leak user information, e.g.,
      randomly or using a per-bundle group counter, and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be 3 bytes or
      less to allow them to efficiently fit into the MID RTP header
      extension. Note that if implementations use different methods for
      generating identification-tags, this could enable fingerprinting of the
      implementation making it vulnerable to targeted attacks. The
      identification-tag is exposed on the RTP stream level when included in
      the RTP header extensions; however, what it reveals of the RTP media
      stream structure of the endpoint and application was already possible to
      deduce from the RTP streams without the MID SDES header extensions. As
      the identification-tag is also used to route the media stream to the
      right application functionality, it is important that the value
      received is the one intended by the sender; thus, integrity and the
      authenticity of the source are important to prevent denial of service on
      the application. Existing SRTP configurations and other security
       mechanisms protecting the whole RTP/RTCP packets will provide the
      necessary protection.</t>

      <t>When the BUNDLE extension is used, the set of configurations of the
	  security mechanism used in all the bundled media descriptions will need to
	  be compatible so that they can be used simultaneously, at least
	  per direction or endpoint. When using SRTP, this will be the case, at least
	  for the IETF-defined key-management solutions due to their SDP attributes
	  ("a=crypto", "a=fingerprint", "a=mikey") and their classification in <xref
	  target="RFC8859" format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>The security considerations of "RTP Header
	  Extension for the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Source Description Items"
	  <xref target="RFC7941" format="default"/> require that when RTCP is confidentiality protected, any SDES
	  RTP header extension carrying an SDES item, such as the MID RTP header
      extension, is also protected using commensurate strength algorithms.
      However, assuming the above requirements and recommendations are
      followed, there are no known significant security risks with leaving the
      MID RTP header extension without confidentiality protection. 
      Therefore, this specification updates RFC 7941 by adding the exception that this requirement 
      <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be ignored for the MID RTP header extension. Security mechanisms for RTP/RTCP are 
      discussed in "Options for Securing RTP Sessions" <xref target="RFC7201" format="default"/>, 
      for example, SRTP <xref target="RFC3711" format="default"/> can provide the necessary security 
      functions of ensuring the integrity and source authenticity.

      <name>Design Considerations</name>
      <t>
        One of the main issues regarding the BUNDLE grouping extensions has been whether,
        in offers and answers, the same port value can be inserted in "m="
        lines associated with a BUNDLE group, as the purpose of the extension is to negotiate
        the usage of a single transport for media specified by the "m=" sections. Issues 
        with both approaches, discussed in the Appendix, have been raised. The outcome was to 
        specify a mechanism that uses offers with both different and identical port values.
      </t>
      <t>
        Below are the primary issues that have been considered when defining the "BUNDLE"
        grouping extension:

        <li>Time to gather, and the number of, ICE candidates.</li>
        <li>Different error scenarios and when they occur.</li>
        <li>SDP offer/answer impacts, including usage of port number value zero.</li>

        RFC 4961 specifies a way of doing symmetric RTP, but that is a later
        extension to RTP, and Bob cannot assume that Alice supports RFC 4961. This
        means that Alice may be sending RTP from a different port than 10000 or
        10002 -- some implementations simply send the RTP from an ephemeral
        port. When Bob's endpoint receives an RTP packet, the only way that Bob
        knows if the packet is to be passed to the video or audio codec is by looking at
        the port it was received on.
        This prompted some SDP implementations to use a port number as an index to find the 
        correct "m=" line in the SDP, since each "m"= section contains a different port number. As a result, some
        implementations that do support symmetric RTP and ICE still use an SDP data
        structure where SDP with "m=" sections with the same port such as:

        <name>Usage of Port Number Value Zero</name>
        <t>
        In an offer or answer, the media specified by an "m=" section can be
        disabled/rejected by setting the port number value to zero. This is different
        from, e.g., using the SDP direction attributes, where RTCP traffic will
        continue even if the SDP 'inactive' attribute is indicated for the
        associated "m=" section.
        </t>
        <t>
        If each "m=" section associated with a BUNDLE group would contain different
        port values, and one of those port values would be used for a BUNDLE address:port
        associated with the BUNDLE group, problems would occur if an endpoint wants to
        disable/reject the "m=" section associated with that port, by setting the port
        value to zero. After that, no "m=" section would contain the port value that
        is used for the BUNDLE address:port. In addition, it is unclear what would happen
        to the ICE candidates associated with the "m=" section, as they are also used for
        the BUNDLE address:port.

        <name>B2BUA and Proxy Interoperability</name>
        <t>
        Some back-to-back user agents may be configured in a mode where if
        the incoming call leg contains an SDP attribute the B2BUA does not
        understand, the B2BUA still generates that SDP attribute in the Offer
        for the outgoing call leg. Consider a B2BUA that did not understand
        the SDP 'rtcp' attribute, defined in RFC 3605, yet acted this way.
        Further assume that the B2BUA was configured to tear down any call
        where it did not see any RTCP for 5 minutes. In this case, if the B2BUA
        received an Offer like:

      It would be looking for RTCP on port 49171 but would not see any
      because the RTCP would be on port 53020, and after five minutes, it would
      tear down the call. Similarly, a B2BUA that did not understand BUNDLE yet
      put it in its offer may be looking for media on the wrong port and
      tear down the call. It is worth noting that a B2BUA that generated an
      Offer with capabilities it does not understand is not compliant with the
      specifications.

          Sometimes intermediaries do not act as B2BUAs, in the sense that
          they don't modify SDP bodies nor do they terminate SIP dialogs.
          However, they may still use SDP information (e.g., IP address and
          port) in order to control traffic gating functions and to set
          traffic policing rules. There might be rules that will trigger
          a session to be terminated in case media is not sent or received
          on the ports retrieved from the SDP. This typically occurs once the
          session is already established and ongoing.

          However, they may still use SDP information (e.g., codecs and
          media types) in order to control bandwidth allocation functions.
          The bandwidth allocation is done per "m=" section, which means that
          it might not be enough if media specified by all "m=" sections
          try to use that bandwidth. That may simply lead to either bad
          user experience or termination of the call.

        <name>Candidate Gathering</name>
        <t>
        When using ICE, a candidate needs to be gathered for each port. This
        takes approximately 20 ms extra for each extra "m=" section due to the NAT
        pacing requirements. All of this gathering can be overlapped with other
        things while, e.g., a web page is loading to minimize the impact. If the client
        only wants to generate Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) or STUN ICE candidates for one of the "m="
        lines and then use Trickle ICE <xref target="RFC8838" format="default"/>
        to get the non-host ICE candidates for the rest of the "m=" sections, it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> do
        that and will not need any additional gathering time.
        </t>
        <t>
        Some people have suggested a TURN extension to get a bunch of TURN
        allocations at once. This would only provide a single STUN result, so in
        cases where the other end did not support BUNDLE, it may cause more use of
        the TURN server, but it would be quick in the cases where both sides
        supported BUNDLE and would fall back to a successful call in the other
        cases.
