      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t><xref target="RFC5440" format="default"/> describes the Path Computation Element (PCE)
      Communication Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP enables communication between a
      Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between a PCE and another
      PCE, for the purpose of the computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) as well as Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label
      Switched Path (TE LSP) characteristics.
      </t>
      <t><xref target="RFC8231" format="default"/> specifies a set of extensions to PCEP
      to enable stateful control of TE LSPs within and across PCEP sessions in
      compliance with <xref target="RFC4657" format="default"/>. It includes mechanisms to
      effect LSP State Synchronization between PCCs and PCEs, delegation of
      control over LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of
      path computations within and across PCEP sessions. The operational model
      whereby LSPs are initiated from the PCE is described in <xref target="RFC8281" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t><xref target="RFC4872" format="default"/> defines the RSVP ASSOCIATION object, which
      was defined in the context of GMPLS-controlled LSPs to be used to
      associate recovery LSPs with the LSP they are protecting. This object
      also has broader applicability as a mechanism to associate RSVP
      state. <xref target="RFC6780" format="default"/> describes how the ASSOCIATION object can
      be more generally applied by defining the Extended ASSOCIATION
      object.</t>
      <t> This document introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs.
       This grouping can then be used to define associations between sets of LSPs or between a
       set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters
       or behaviors), and it is equally applicable to the stateful PCE (active
       and passive modes) and the stateless PCE.
       The associations could be created dynamically and conveyed to a PCEP
       peer within PCEP, or they could be configured manually by an operator
       on the PCEP peers. Refer to <xref target="Operation-overview" format="default"/> for
       more details.

        <t>A stateful PCE provides the ability to update existing LSPs and to
     instantiate new ones. There are various situations where several
     LSPs need to share common information. For example, to support
     PCE-controlled make-before-break, an association between the original
     path and the reoptimized path is desired. Similarly, for end-to-end
     protection, an association between working and protection LSPs is
     required (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-path-protection" format="default"/>). For diverse paths, an
     association between a group of LSPs could be used (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-diversity" format="default"/>).  Another use for an LSP grouping would be to apply
     a common set of configuration parameters or behaviors to a set of LSPs.
        </t>
        <t>
      For a  stateless PCE, it might be useful to associate a PCReq message to an association group, thus enabling it to associate
      a common set of policies, configuration parameters, or behaviors with the request.
        </t>
        <t>Some associations could be created dynamically, such as an association
     between the working and protection LSPs of a tunnel, whereas
     some associations could be created by the operator manually, such as
     a policy-based association where the LSP could join an
     operator-configured existing association.</t>
        <t>
     Rather than creating separate mechanisms for each use case, this document
     defines a generic mechanism that can be reused as needed.

        <name>Relationship to the SVEC List</name>
        <t>Note that <xref target="RFC5440" format="default"/> defines a mechanism for the
       synchronization of a set of PCReq messages by using the SVEC
       (Synchronization VECtor) object, which specifies the list of
       synchronized requests that can be either dependent or independent. The
       SVEC object identifies the relationship between the set of
       PCReq messages, identified by "Request-ID-number" in the RP
       (Request Parameters) object. <xref target="RFC6007" format="default"/> further clarifies
       the use of the SVEC list for synchronized path computations when
       computing dependent requests, and it describes a number of usage
       scenarios for SVEC lists within single-domain and multi-domain
       environments.</t>
        <t>The motivations behind the association group defined in this document
   and the SVEC object are quite different, though some use cases may
   overlap.  PCEP extensions that define a new Association Type should
   clarify the relationship between the SVEC object and the Association
   Type, if any.</t>

      <section anchor="Operation-overview" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Operational Overview</name>
        <t>
     LSPs are associated with other LSPs with which they interact by
     adding them to a common association group.  Association groups as
     defined in this document can be applied to LSPs originating at the same
     headend or different headends.</t>
        <t>Some associations could be created dynamically by a PCEP speaker, and
     the associations (along with the set of LSPs) are conveyed to a PCEP
     peer. Whereas some associations are configured by the operator
     beforehand on the PCEP peers in question, a PCEP speaker could then ask
     an LSP to join the Operator-configured Association. Usage of dynamic and
     configured associations is usually dependent on the type of
     association.</t>
        <t>For Operator-configured Associations, the association
parameters, such as the Association Identifier (Association ID), Association Type, and
the Association Source IP address, are manually configured by the
operator. In the case of a dynamic association, the association parameters,
such as the Association ID, are allocated dynamically by the
PCEP speaker. The Association Source is set as the local PCEP speaker
address unless local policy dictates otherwise, in which case the
Association Source is set based on the local policy.</t>
        <t>The dynamically created association can be reported to the PCEP peer
     via the PCEP messages as per the stateful extensions. When the
     Operator-configured Association is known to the PCEP peer beforehand, a
     PCEP peer could ask an LSP to join the Operator-configured Association
     via the stateful PCEP messages.</t>
        <t>The associations are properties of the LSP and thus could be stored in
    the LSP state database. The dynamic association exists as long as the LSP
state exists. In the case of PCEP session termination, the LSP state cleanup
    <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also take care of associations.</t>
        <t>Multiple types of associations can exist, each with its own
     Association ID space. The definition of the different Association
     Types and their behaviors is outside the scope of this document.  The
     establishment and removal of the association relationship can be done on
     a per-LSP basis. An LSP may join multiple association groups that have
     the same Association Type or different Association Types.</t>

      <section anchor="Range" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Operator-Configured Association Range</name>
        <t>Some Association Types are dynamic, some are operator configured,
       and some could be both. For the Association Types that could be both
       dynamic and operator configured and use the same
       Association Source, it is necessary to distinguish a range of
       Association IDs that are marked for Operator-configured
       Associations, to avoid any Association ID clashes within the
       scope of the Association Source. This document assumes that these two
       ranges are configured.
</t>
        <t>A range of Association IDs for each Association Type (and
       Association Source) is kept for the Operator-configured
       Associations. Dynamic associations <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> use the
       Association ID from this range. </t>
        <t>This range, as set at the PCEP speaker (a PCC or PCE, as an
       Association Source), needs to be communicated to a PCEP peer in the
       Open message. A new TLV is defined in this specification for this
       purpose (<xref target="Range-tlv" format="default"/>). See <xref target="ex" format="default"/> for an
       example.</t>
        <t>The Association ID range for sources other than the PCEP
       speaker (for example, a Network Management System (NMS)) is not
       communicated in PCEP, and the procedure for Operator-configured
       Association Range settings is outside the scope of this document.</t>

        <t>The PCEP ASSOC-Type-List TLV format is compliant with the PCEP TLV format defined

   field defines the length of the value portion in octets.  The TLV is
   padded to 4-octet alignment, and padding is not included in the

   the total size of the TLV would be 8 octets).</t>

          <t>An ASSOC-Type-List TLV within an OPEN object in an Open
   message is included by a PCEP speaker in order to advertise a set of one or
   more supported Association Types.  The ASSOC-Type-List TLV <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> appear more than
   once in an OPEN object.  If it appears more than once, the PCEP
   session <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be rejected with Error-Type 1 and Error-value 1 (PCEP
   session establishment failure / Reception of an invalid Open
   message). As specified in <xref target="RFC5440" format="default"/>, a PCEP peer that does not recognize the
   ASSOC-Type-List TLV will silently ignore it.</t>
          <t>The Association Type (to be defined in future documents) can specify if
the Association Type advertisement is mandatory for it. 
Thus, the ASSOC-Type-List TLV <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be included if at least one mandatory
 Association Type needs to be advertised, and the ASSOC-Type-List TLV <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be
 included otherwise. For an Association Type that specifies that the
 advertisement is mandatory, a missing Assoc-Type in the ASSOC-Type-List TLV
 (or a missing ASSOC-Type-List TLV) is to be interpreted as meaning that the
 Association Type is not supported by the PCEP speaker.</t>
          <t>The absence of the ASSOC-Type-List TLV in an OPEN object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
   interpreted as an absence of information in the list of supported
   Association Types (rather than an indication that the Association Type is
   not supported). In this case, the PCEP
   speaker could still use the ASSOCIATION object: if the peer does not
   support the association, it will react as per the procedure described
   in <xref target="Rules" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>If the use of the ASSOC-Type-List TLV is triggered by support for a
   mandatory Association Type, then it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the PCEP
   implementation include all supported Association Types (including optional
   types) to ease the operations of the PCEP peer.</t>

        <t>A PCEP speaker <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include an OP-CONF-ASSOC-RANGE TLV within an OPEN object in an Open
   message sent to a PCEP peer in order to advertise the Operator-configured Association Range for an Association Type. 
   The OP-CONF-ASSOC-RANGE TLV <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> appear more than
   once in an OPEN object.  If it appears more than once, the PCEP
   session <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be rejected with Error-Type 1 and Error-value 1 (PCEP
   session establishment failure / Reception of an invalid Open
   message).</t>
        <t>As specified in <xref target="RFC5440" format="default"/>, a PCEP peer that does not recognize the
   OP-CONF-ASSOC-RANGE TLV will silently ignore it.</t>
        <t>The Operator-configured Association Range <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be included for each
   Association Type that could be both dynamic and operator configured. For
   Association Types that are only dynamic or only operator configured, this
   TLV <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be skipped, in which case the full range of Association IDs
   is considered dynamic or operator configured, respectively. Each
   Association Type (to be defined in future documents) can specify the default
   value for its Operator-configured Association Range.</t>
        <t>The absence of the OP-CONF-ASSOC-RANGE TLV in an OPEN object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
   interpreted as an absence of an explicit Operator-configured Association Range at the PCEP peer. 
   In this case, the default behavior as per each Association Type applies. If the Association 
   Source is not a PCEP speaker, the default value for the Operator-configured Association Range is used for the Association Source.</t>
        <t>If the Assoc-Type is not recognized or supported by the PCEP speaker, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore that respective (Start-Assoc-ID + Range). If the Assoc-Type is recognized/supported but Start-Assoc-ID or Range is set incorrectly, the PCEP
   session <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be rejected with Error-Type 1 and Error-value 1 (PCEP
   session establishment failure / Reception of an invalid Open
   message). The incorrect range includes the case when the
   (Start-Assoc-ID + Range) crosses the largest Association ID value of
   0xffff.</t>
        <t>A given Assoc-Type <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> appear more than once in the
   OP-CONF-ASSOC-RANGE TLV in the case of a non-contiguous
   Operator-configured Association Range. The PCEP speaker originating this
   TLV <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> send overlapping ranges for an Association Type. If a PCEP
   peer receives overlapping ranges for an Association Type, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> consider
   the Open message malformed and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reject the PCEP session with
   Error-Type 1 and Error-value 1 (PCEP session establishment failure /
   Reception of an invalid Open message).</t>
        <t>There may be cases where an Operator-configured Association was

   remove any associations that are not in the new operator-configured range
   (by disassociating any LSPs that are part of it (and notifying the
   PCEP peer of this change)). If a PCEP speaker receives an association for an
   Operator-configured Association and the Association ID is not in
   the Operator-configured Association Range for the Association Type and

        <t>
    Association groups can be operator configured on the necessary PCEP
    speakers, and the PCEP speakers can join the existing association groups. 
    In addition, a PCC or a PCE can create association groups dynamically, and
    the PCEP speaker can also report the associations to its peer via PCEP
    messages. The Operator-configured Associations are created via
    configurations (where all association parameters are manually set) and
    exist until explicitly removed via configurations. The PCEP speaker can
    add LSPs to these configured associations and provide this information
    via stateful PCEP messages. The dynamic associations are created
    dynamically by the PCEP speaker (where all association parameters are
    populated dynamically). The association group is attached to the LSP
    state, and the association group exists until there is at least one LSP as
    part of the association. As described in <xref target="id" format="default"/>, the
    association parameters are the combination of Association Type,
    Association ID, and Association Source, as well as the optional Global
    Association Source and Extended Association ID TLVs; this combination
    uniquely identifies an association group. The information
    related to the Association Types encoded via the TLVs of a particular
    Association Type (not described in this document) is the association
    information (<xref target="id" format="default"/>).</t>

        <t>If a PCEP speaker does not recognize the ASSOCIATION object in the
    stateful message, it will return a PCErr message with Error-Type  "Unknown
    Object" as described in <xref target="RFC5440" format="default"/>. In the case of a PCReq
    message, the PCE would react based on the P flag as per <xref target="RFC5440" format="default"/>. If a PCEP speaker understands the ASSOCIATION object
    but does not support the Association Type, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return a PCErr message
    with Error-Type 26 "Association Error" and
    Error-value 1 "Association Type is not supported". If any association
    parameters are invalid in the ASSOCIATION object, the PCEP speaker would
    consider this object malformed and process it as a malformed message <xref target="RFC5440" format="default"/>. On receiving a PCEP message with an ASSOCIATION
    object, if a PCEP speaker finds that too many LSPs belong to the
    association group, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return a PCErr message with Error-Type 26
     "Association Error" and Error-value 2 "Too
    many LSPs in the association group". If a PCEP speaker cannot handle a new
    association, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return a PCErr message with Error-Type 26
     "Association Error" and Error-value 3 "Too many
    association groups". These numbers <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be set by the operator or chosen
    based on a local policy. </t>
        <t>If a PCE peer is unwilling or unable to process the ASSOCIATION object
    in the stateful message, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return a PCErr message with the
    Error-Type "Not supported object" and follow the relevant procedures
    described in <xref target="RFC5440" format="default"/>. In the case of a PCReq message, the
    PCE would react based on the P flag as per <xref target="RFC5440" format="default"/>. On
    receiving a PCEP message with an ASSOCIATION object, if a PCEP speaker
    could not add the LSP to the association group for any reason, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
    return a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 
    "Association Error" and Error-value 7 "Cannot join the association
    group".</t>
        <t>If a PCEP speaker receives an ASSOCIATION object for an Operator-configured Association 
      and the Association ID is not in the Operator-configured Association Range
      for the Association Type and Association Source, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 
      "Association Error" and Error-value 8 "Association ID not in range".
        </t>
        <t>If a PCEP speaker receives an ASSOCIATION object in a PCReq message
      and the association is not known (the association is not configured, 
      was not created dynamically, or was not learned from a PCEP peer), it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return a
      PCErr message with Error-Type 26 "Association
      Error" and Error-value 4 "Association unknown".</t>
        <t>If the association information (related to the association group as a
    whole) received from the peer does not match the local operator-configured
    information, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 "Association Error" and Error-value 5
    "Operator-configured association information mismatch". On receiving
    association information (related to the association group as a whole) that
    does not match the association information previously received about the
    same association from a peer, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return a PCErr message with
    Error-Type 26 "Association Error" and
    Error-value 6 "Association information mismatch". Note that information
    related to each LSP within the association as part of the association
    information TLVs could be different.
        </t>
        <t>If a PCEP speaker receives an ASSOCIATION object with the R bit set for
    removal and the association group (identified by association parameters)
    is not known, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return a PCErr message with Error-Type 26
     "Association Error" and Error-value 4
    "Association unknown".</t>
        <t>The dynamic associations are cleared along with the LSP state
    information as per <xref target="RFC8231" format="default"/>. When a PCEP session is
    terminated, after expiry of the State Timeout Interval at the PCC, the LSP
    state associated with that PCEP session is reverted to operator-defined
    default parameters or behaviors. The same procedure is also followed for
    the association groups. On session termination at the PCE, when the LSP
    state reported by the PCC is cleared, the association groups are also
    cleared. When there are no LSPs in an association group, the association
    is considered empty and thus deleted.</t>
        <t>If the LSP is delegated to another PCE on session failure,
    the associations (and association information) set by the PCE remain
    intact, unless updated by the new PCE that takes over. </t>
        <t>Upon LSP delegation revocation, the PCC <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> clear the association
    created by the PCE, but in order to avoid traffic loss, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
    perform this action in a make-before-break fashion (same as <xref target="RFC8231" format="default"/>).</t>

   related to a malicious PCEP speaker are introduced, as associations could

   attack vector. An attacker could attempt to create too many associations in
   an attempt to load the PCEP peer. The PCEP peer responds with a PCErr

   LSP operations by creating bogus associations. Further, association groups
   could provide an adversary with the opportunity to eavesdrop on the

      <name>Example of an Operator-Configured Association Range</name>
      <t>Consider an Association Type T1 (which allows both dynamic and
    Operator-configured Associations with a default range of
    &lt;0x1000, 0xffff&gt;). Consider that, because of the needs of the
    network, the PCE needs to create more dynamic associations and would like
    to change the Association Range to &lt;0xbffe, 0xffff&gt; instead. During
    PCEP session establishment, the PCE would advertise the new range. The PCC
    could skip advertising, as the default values are used. If a PCC is
    creating a dynamic association (with the PCC as the Association Source),
    it needs to pick a free Association ID for type T1 in the range
    &lt;0x1, 0x0fff&gt;, whereas if a PCE is creating a dynamic association
    (with the PCE as the Association Source), it needs to pick a free
    Association ID from the range &lt;0x1, 0xbffd&gt;. Similarly, if
    an Operator-configured Association is manually configured with the PCC as
    the Association Source, it should be from the range &lt;0x1000,
    0xffff&gt;, whereas if the PCE is the Association Source, it should be
    from the range &lt;0xbffe, 0xffff&gt;. If the Association Source is
    not a PCEP peer (for example, an NMS), then the default range of
    &lt;0x1000, 0xffff&gt; is considered.</t>
