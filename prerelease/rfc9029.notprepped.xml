      <t>RFC 7752 defines the Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS).  IANA created
         a registry consistent with that document called "Border Gateway Protocol - Link
         State (BGP-LS) Parameters" with a number of subregistries.  The
         allocation policy applied by IANA for those registries is "Specification Required",
         as defined in RFC 8126.</t>
      <t>This document updates RFC 7752 by changing the allocation policy for all of
         the registries to "Expert Review" and by updating the guidance to the designated
         experts.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>"North-Bound Distribution of Link-State and Traffic Engineering (TE) Information Using BGP" <xref target="RFC7752" format="default"/> requested IANA to create
         a registry called "Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS)
         Parameters" with a number of subregistries.  The allocation policy
         applied by IANA for those registries is "Specification Required", as defined in
      <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/>.</t>
            <t>The "Specification Required" policy requires evaluation of any assignment
         request by a "designated expert", and guidelines for any such experts are
         given in <xref target="RFC7752" sectionFormat="of" section="5.1"/>.  In addition, this policy requires that "the
         values and their meanings must be documented in a permanent and readily
         available public specification, in sufficient detail so that
         interoperability between independent implementations is possible" <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/>.
         Further, the intention behind "permanent and readily available" is that "a
         document can reasonably be expected to be findable and retrievable long after
         IANA assignment of the requested value" <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Another allocation policy called "Expert Review" is defined in <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/>.
         This policy also requires Expert Review but has no requirement for a
         formal document.</t>
      <t>All reviews by designated experts are guided by advice given in the
         document that defined the registry and set the allocation policy.</t>
      <t>This document updates <xref target="RFC7752" format="default"/> by changing the allocation policy for all of
         the registries to "Expert Review" and updating the guidance to the
         designated experts.</t>

      <t>IANA maintains a registry called "Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) Parameters".
         This registry contains four subregistries:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>BGP-LS NLRI-Types</li>
        <li>BGP-LS Protocol-IDs</li>

        <li>BGP-LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute TLVs</li>
      </ul>
      <t>IANA has changed the assignment policy for each of these registries to "Expert Review".</t>
      <t>IANA has also added this document as a reference for the registries mentioned above.</t>

        <name>Guidance for Designated Experts</name>	

<t><xref target="RFC7752" sectionFormat="of" section="5.1"/> gives guidance to designated experts.  This section replaces that guidance.</t>

        <t>In all cases of review by the designated expert described here,
           the designated expert is expected to check the clarity of purpose and use of the
           requested code points.  The following points apply to the registries
           discussed in this document:

        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>Application for a code point allocation may be made to the
                designated experts at any time and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be accompanied
                by technical documentation explaining the use of the code
                point.  Such documentation <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be presented in the
                form of an Internet-Draft but <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> arrive in any form that
                can be reviewed and exchanged amongst reviewers.</li>
          <li>The designated experts <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> only consider requests that arise
                from Internet-Drafts that have already been accepted as working group
                documents or that are planned for progression as AD-Sponsored
                documents in the absence of a suitably chartered working group.</li>
          <li>In the case of working group documents, the designated experts
                <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> check with the working group chairs that there is
                consensus within the working group to make the allocation at this
                time.  In the case of AD-Sponsored documents, the designated
                experts <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> check with the AD for approval to make the
                allocation at this time.</li>
          <li>If the document is not adopted by the IDR Working Group (or its
                successor), the designated expert <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> notify the IDR mailing list
                (or its successor) of the request and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> provide access to the
                document.  The designated expert <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> allow two weeks for any response.
                Any comments received <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be considered by the designated expert
                as part of the subsequent step.</li>
          <li>The designated experts <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> then review the assignment requests
                on their technical merit.  The designated experts <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> raise
                issues related to the allocation request with the
                authors and on the IDR (or successor) mailing list
                for further consideration before the assignments
                are made.</li>
          <li>The designated expert <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure that any request for
                a code point does not conflict with work that is active or already
                published within the IETF.</li>
          <li>Once the designated experts have granted approval, IANA will
                update the registry by marking the allocated code points with a
                reference to the associated document.</li>
          <li>In the event that the document is a working group document or is
                AD Sponsored, and that document fails to progress to publication
                as an RFC, the working group chairs or AD <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> contact IANA
                to coordinate about marking the code points as deprecated.  A
                deprecated code point is not marked as allocated for use and is not
                available for allocation in a future document.  The WG chairs may
                inform IANA that a deprecated code point can be completely
                deallocated (i.e., made available for new allocations) at any time
                after it has been deprecated if there is a shortage of unallocated
                code points in the registry.</li>

    <section anchor="Security" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The security considerations described in <xref target="RFC7752" sectionFormat="of" section="8"/> still apply.</t>
      <t>Note that the change to the Expert Review guidelines makes the registry and the designated experts slightly more
         vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks through excessive and bogus requests for code points.  It is expected that
         the registry cannot be effectively attacked because the designated experts would, themselves, fall to any such
         attack first.  Designated experts are expected to report to the IDR Working Group chairs and responsible Area
         Director if they believe an attack to be in progress and should immediately halt all requests for allocation.
         This may temporarily block all legitimate requests until mitigations have been put in place.</t>
