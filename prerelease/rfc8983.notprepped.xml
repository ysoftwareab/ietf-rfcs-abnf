      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>As described in <xref target="RFC7849" format="default"/>, if the subscription
      data or network configuration allows only one IP address family (IPv4 or
      IPv6), the cellular host must not request a second PDP-Context (<xref target="RFC6459" sectionFormat="of" section="3.2"/>) to the same Access Point Name
      (APN) for the other IP address family (AF). The Third Generation
      Partnership Project (3GPP) network informs the cellular host about
      allowed Packet Data Protocol (PDP) types by means of Session Management
      (SM) cause codes. In particular, the following cause codes can be
      returned: </t>

<dl>

<dt>cause #50 "PDP type IPv4 only allowed":
</dt>
<dd>This cause code is used by the network to indicate that only PDP type IPv4
is allowed for the requested Public Data Network (PDN) connectivity.
</dd>

<dt>cause #51 "PDP type IPv6 only allowed":
</dt>
<dd>This cause code is used by the network to indicate that only PDP type IPv6
is allowed for the requested PDN connectivity.
</dd>

<dt>cause #52 "single address bearers only allowed":
</dt>
<dd>This cause code is used by the network to indicate that the requested PDN connectivity is accepted with the restriction that only single IP version bearers are allowed.
</dd>

</dl>
     
      <t>If the requested IPv4v6 PDP-Context is not supported by the network
      but IPv4 and IPv6 PDP types are allowed, then the cellular host will be
      configured with an IPv4 address or an IPv6 prefix by the network. It
      must initiate another PDP-Context activation of the other address family
      in addition to the one already activated for a given APN. The purpose of
      initiating a second PDP-Context is to achieve dual-stack connectivity
      (that is, IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity) by means of two PDP-Contexts.</t>
      <t>When the User Equipment (UE) attaches to the 3GPP network using a
      non-3GPP access network (e.g., Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)),
      there are no equivalent IKEv2
      capabilities <xref target="RFC7296" format="default"/> notification codes for the
      3GPP network to inform the UE why an IP address family is not assigned
      or whether that UE should retry with another address family.</t>
      <t>This document fills that void by introducing new IKEv2 notification
      status types for the sake of deterministic UE behaviors (<xref target="new" format="default"/>).</t>
      <t>These notification status types are not specific to 3GPP
      architectures but can be used in other deployment contexts. Cellular
      networks are provided as an illustration example.</t>

      <name>Why Not INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE?</name>


      <t>The following address assignment failures may be encountered when an
      initiator requests assignment of IP addresses/prefixes:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>An initiator asks for IPvx, but IPvx address assignment is not
          supported by the responder.</li>
        <li>An initiator requests both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but only IPv4
          address assignment is supported by the responder.</li>
        <li>An initiator requests both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but only IPv6
          prefix assignment is supported by the responder.</li>
        <li>An initiator asks for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but only one
          address family can be assigned by the responder for policy
          reasons.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>
      <xref target="RFC7296" sectionFormat="of" section="3.15.4"/> defines a
      generic notification error type (INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE) that is
      related to a failure to handle an address assignment request. The
      responder sends INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE only if no addresses can be
      assigned. This behavior does not explicitly allow an initiator to
      determine why a given address family is not assigned, nor whether it
      should try using another address family. INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE is a
      catch-all error type when an address-related issue is encountered by an
      IKEv2 responder.</t>
      <t>INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE does not provide sufficient hints to the
      IKEv2 initiator to adjust its behavior.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="new" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>IP6_ALLOWED and IP4_ALLOWED Status Types</name>
      <t>IP6_ALLOWED and IP4_ALLOWED notification status types (see <xref target="sec-IANA" format="default"/>) are defined to inform the initiator about the
      responder's address family assignment support capabilities and to
      report to the initiator the reason why an address assignment failed.
      These notification status types are used by the initiator to adjust its
      behavior accordingly (<xref target="update" format="default"/>).</t>
      <t>No data is associated with these notifications.</t>

    <section anchor="update" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Update to RFC 7296</name>

      <t>If the initiator is dual stack (i.e., supports both IPv4 and IPv6),
      it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include configuration attributes for both address
      families in its configuration request (absent explicit
      policy/configuration otherwise).  More details about IPv4 and IPv6
      configuration attributes are provided in <xref target="RFC7296"
      sectionFormat="of" section="3.15"/>. These attributes are used to infer
      the requested/assigned AFs listed in <xref
      target="notification_status"/>.</t>
      <t>The responder <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the IP6_ALLOWED and/or IP4_ALLOWED
      notification status type in a response to an address assignment request
      as indicated in <xref target="notification_status"/>.</t>
