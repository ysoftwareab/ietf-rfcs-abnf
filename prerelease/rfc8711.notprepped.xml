    <abstract>
      <t>The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally
established in 2005. In the years since then, the needs of the IETF
evolved in ways that required changes to its administrative
structure. The purpose of this RFC is to document and describe
the IETF Administrative Support Activity, version 2.0 (IASA 2.0). It
defines the roles and responsibilities of the IETF Administration LLC
Board (IETF LLC Board), the IETF Executive Director, and the Internet Society in the
fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards process.  It
also defines the membership and selection rules for the IETF
LLC Board.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally
established in 2005.  In the years since then, the needs of the 
IETF evolved in ways that required changes to its administrative 
structure.  The purpose of this document is to document and describe
the IASA 2.0 structure.</t>
      <t>Under IASA 2.0, the work of the IETF's administrative and fundraising 
tasks is conducted by an administrative organization, the IETF Administration 
LLC (IETF LLC). Under this structure, the IETF 
Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) is eliminated, and its oversight 
and advising functions transferred to the IETF LLC Board.</t>
      <t>The IETF LLC provides the corporate legal home for the IETF, the Internet 
Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and 
financial support for the operation of the RFC Editor.</t>
      <t><xref target="I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs" format="default"/> discusses the challenges facing the
original IASA structure as well as several options for reorganizing the
IETF's administration under different legal structures. This document
outlines how the chosen option is structured and describes how
the organization fits together with existing and new IETF
community structures.</t>
      <t>Under IASA 2.0, most of the responsibilities that <xref target="RFC4071" format="default"/> assigned to 
the IETF Administrative Director (IAD) and the Internet Society (ISOC) were 
transferred to the IETF LLC and IETF Administration LLC Executive Director 
(IETF Executive Director). It is the job of the IETF LLC to meet the 
administrative needs of the IETF and to ensure that the IETF LLC meets the 
needs of the IETF community.</t>
      <t>Eliminating the IAOC meant that changes were required in how
trustees could be appointed to the IETF Trust. The details of how this
is done are outside the scope of this document but are covered in
<xref target="RFC8714" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC4071" format="default"/>, which specified the original IASA, 
<xref target="RFC4333" format="default"/>, which specified the selection guidelines and process for IAOC 
members, and <xref target="RFC7691" format="default"/>, which specified terms for IAOC members.</t>

      <name>Scope Limitation</name>
      <t>The document does not propose any changes related to the
standards process as currently conducted
by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and Internet
Architecture Board (IAB) (see BCP 9 <xref target="RFC2026" format="default"/> and
BCP 39 <xref target="RFC2850" format="default"/>). In addition, no changes are made to the appeals 
chain, the process for making and confirming IETF and IAB appointments (see
BCP 10 <xref target="RFC8713" format="default"/>), 
the technical work of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) (see <xref
target="RFC2014" format="default"/>), or to ISOC's membership in or support of other organizations.</t>

      <name>LLC Agreement with the Internet Society</name>
      <t>The LLC Agreement between the IETF LLC and ISOC is available 
at <xref target="IETF-LLC-A" format="default"/>. This IASA 2.0 structure, and thus this document, 
depends on the LLC Agreement and will refer to it to help 
explain certain aspects of the legal
relationship between the IETF LLC and ISOC.</t>
      <t>The LLC Agreement was developed
between legal representatives of the IETF and ISOC and includes all
critical terms of the relationship, while still enabling maximum
unilateral flexibility for the IETF LLC Board.  The LLC Agreement includes only basic
details about how the Board manages itself or manages IETF LLC staff,
so that the Board has flexibility to make changes without amending
the agreement. The Board can independently develop policy or procedures
documents that fill gaps.</t>

        <name>General IETF LLC Responsibilities</name>
        <t>The IETF LLC is established to provide administrative support to the IETF. It has no authority over the standards development activities of the IETF.</t>
        <t>The responsibilities of the IETF LLC are:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Operations. The IETF LLC is responsible for supporting the ongoing operations of the IETF, including meetings and non-meeting activities.</li>
          <li>Finances. The IETF LLC is responsible for managing the IETF's finances and budget.</li>
          <li>Fundraising. The IETF LLC is responsible for raising money on behalf of the IETF.</li>
          <li>Compliance. The IETF LLC is responsible for establishing and enforcing policies to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The manner by which these responsibilities under the IETF LLC are organized
is intended to address the problems described in Sections 
<xref target="I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs" section="3.1.1" sectionFormat="bare"/>, 
<xref target="I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs" section="3.1.2" sectionFormat="bare"/>, and 
<xref target="I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs" section="3.1.3" sectionFormat="bare"/>
of <xref target="I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs" format="default"/>.
Specifically, this is
intended to bring greater clarity around roles, responsibilities,
representation, decision-making, and authority.</t>
        <t>In addition, by having the IETF LLC manage the IETF's finances and conduct the IETF's fundraising, confusion about who is responsible for representing the IETF to sponsors and who directs the uses of sponsorship funds should be eliminated. Finally, having the IETF LLC reside in a defined, distinct legal entity, and taking responsibility for operations, enables the organization to execute its own contracts without the need for review and approval by ISOC.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="principles" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>IETF LLC Working Principles</name>
        <t>The IETF LLC is expected to conduct its work according to the following principles:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Transparency. The IETF LLC is expected to keep the IETF community informed about its work, 
subject to reasonable confidentiality concerns, and to engage with the community to obtain 
consensus-based community input on key issues and otherwise as needed. The IETF community expects 
complete visibility into the financial and legal structure of the IETF LLC. This includes information 
about the IETF LLC annual budget and associated regular financial reports, results of financial and any 
other independent audits, tax filings, significant contracts, or other significant long-term financial 
commitments that bind the IETF LLC. Whatever doesn't have a specific 
justification for being kept confidential is expected to be made public. The Board is expected to develop 
and maintain a public list of confidential items, describing the nature of the information and the reason 
for confidentiality. The Board will also publish its operating procedures.</li>
          <li>Responsiveness to the community. The IETF LLC is expected to act consistently with the documented consensus of the IETF community, to be responsive to the community's needs, and to adapt its decisions in response to consensus-based community feedback.</li>
          <li>Diligence. The IETF LLC is expected to act responsibly so as to minimize risks to IETF participants and to the future of the IETF as a whole, such as financial risks.</li>
          <li>Unification: The IETF LLC provides the corporate legal home for the IETF, the Internet 
Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and 
financial support for the operation of the RFC Editor.</li>
          <li>Transfer or Dissolution: Consistent with <xref target="IETF-LLC-A" format="default"/>, the IETF LLC subsidiary may be transferred from ISOC to 
another organization, at the request of either party. Similarly, the IETF LLC may be dissolved if necessary. Should 
either event occur, the IETF community should be closely involved in any decisions and plans. Any transfer, 
transition, or dissolution should be conducted carefully and with minimal potential disruption to the IETF.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The transparency and responsiveness principles are designed to address the concern outlined in 
<xref target="I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs" section="3.3" sectionFormat="of"/> about the need for improved timeliness of sharing of information and decisions and seeking community comments. The issue of increased transparency was important throughout the IASA 2.0 process, with little to no dissent.  It was recognized that there will naturally be confidentiality requirements about some aspects of contracting, personnel matters, and other narrow areas.</t>

        <name>Principles of the IETF and ISOC Relationship</name>
        <t>The principles of the relationship between the IETF and ISOC are outlined in <xref target="RFC8712" format="default"/>. 
In short, the IETF is responsible for the development of the Internet Standards and ISOC aids the IETF by 
providing it a legal entity within which the IETF LLC exists, as well as with financial support.</t>

        <name>Relationship of the IETF LLC Board to the IETF Leadership</name>
        <t>The IETF LLC Board is directly accountable to the IETF community for the
performance of the IASA 2.0.  However, the nature of the Board's work
involves treating the IESG, IRTF, and IAB as major internal customers of the
administrative support services.  The Board and the IETF Executive Director should not
consider their work successful unless the IESG, IRTF, and IAB are also
satisfied with the administrative support that the IETF is receiving.</t>

        <t>The IETF LLC Board is directly accountable to the IETF community for the performance of the IASA 2.0, including hiring and managing the IETF Executive Director. In extreme cases of dissatisfaction with the IETF LLC, the IETF community can utilize the recall process as noted in <xref target="director-removal" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>Anyone in the community of IETF participants may ask the Board for a formal review of a decision or action by the IETF Executive Director or Board if they believe this was not undertaken in accordance with IETF BCPs or IETF 
LLC Board policies and procedures.</t>
        <t>A formal request for review must be addressed to the IETF LLC Board chair and must include a description of the decision or action to be reviewed, an explanation of how, in the requestor's opinion, the decision or action violates the BCPs or IASA 2.0 operational guidelines, and a suggestion for how the situation could be rectified.</t>
        <t>The IETF LLC shall respond to such requests within a reasonable period, typically within 90 days, and shall publicly publish information about the request and the corresponding response and/or result.</t>

        <name>IETF Executive Director and Staff Responsibilities</name>
        <t>The IETF LLC is led by an IETF Executive Director chosen by the Board. The IETF Executive Director is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the IETF LLC, including hiring staff to perform various operational functions. The IETF Executive Director and any staff may be employees or independent contractors.</t>
        <t>Allowing for the division of responsibilities among multiple staff members and contractors is designed to address some of the concerns raised in 
Section <xref target="I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs" section="3.2" sectionFormat="bare"/> (Lack of Resources) and 
Section <xref target="I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs" section="3.4" sectionFormat="bare"/> (Funding/Operating Model Mismatch and Rising Costs) of <xref target="I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>Based on the amount of work previously undertaken by the IAD and others involved in the IETF administration, the design of the IETF LLC anticipated that the IETF Executive Director may need to hire multiple additional staff members. For example, resources to manage fundraising, to manage the various contractors that are engaged to fulfill the IETF's administrative needs, and to support outreach and communications were envisioned.</t>
        <t>The IETF has historically benefited from the use of contractors for
	accounting, finance, meeting planning, administrative assistance,
	legal counsel, tools, and web site support, as well as other services
	related to the standards process (e.g., RFC Editor and IANA). Prior to making the transition from IASA to IASA 2.0, the IETF budget reflected specific support from ISOC for communications and fundraising as well as some general support for accounting, finance, legal, and other services. The division of responsibilities between staff and contractors is at the discretion of the IETF Executive Director and their staff.</t>
        <t>The IETF has a long history of community involvement in the execution of certain administrative functions, in particular development of IETF tools, the operation of the meeting network by the Network Operations Center (NOC), and some outreach and communications activities conducted by the Education and Mentoring Directorate. The IETF LLC staff is expected to respect the IETF community's wishes about community involvement in these and other functions going forward as long as the staff feels that they can meet the otherwise-stated needs of the community. Establishing the framework to allow the IETF LLC to staff each administrative function as appropriate may require the IETF community to document its consensus expectations in areas where no documentation currently exists.</t>
        <t>In summary, the IETF Executive Director, with support from the team that they alone direct and lead, is responsible for:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Developing and refining an annual budget and other strategic financial planning documents at the direction of the Board.</li>
          <li>Executing on the annual budget, including reporting to the Board regularly with forecasts and actual performance to budget.</li>
          <li>Hiring and/or contracting the necessary resources to meet their goals, within the defined limits of the IETF 
Executive Director's authority and within the approved budget. This includes managing and leading any such 
resources, including performing regular performance reviews.</li>
          <li>Following the pre-approval guidelines set forth by the Board for contracts or other decisions that have financial costs that exceed a certain threshold of significance. Such thresholds are expected to be set reasonably high so that the need for such approvals is infrequent and only occurs when something is truly significant or otherwise exceptional. It is expected that the IETF Executive Director is sufficiently empowered to perform the job on a day-to-day basis, being held accountable for meeting high-level goals rather than being micromanaged.</li>
          <li>Regularly updating the Board on operations and other notable issues as reasonable and appropriate.</li>
          <li>Ensuring that all staff and/or other resources comply with any applicable policies established or approved by the Board, such as ethics guidelines and/or a code of conduct.</li>
        </ul>

      <section anchor="board-responsibilities" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>IETF LLC Board Responsibilities</name>
        <t>This section is intended to provide a summary of key IETF LLC Board responsibilities, 
but the precise and legally binding responsibilities are defined in the LLC Agreement 
<xref target="IETF-LLC-A" format="default"/> and applicable law. 
   If there are unintentional differences or other
   confusion, the LLC Agreement and applicable law are authoritative.</t>
        <t>Board members have fiduciary obligations imposed by the LLC Agreement and applicable law, 
including duties of loyalty, care, and good faith. The Board is responsible
for setting broad strategic direction for the LLC, adopting an annual budget, hiring or terminating an 
IETF Executive Director (or amending the terms of their engagement), adopting any employee benefit plans, 
consulting the relevant IETF communities on matters related to the LLC as appropriate, approving any 
changes to the LLC governance structure, incurring any debt, and approving entering into agreements 
that meet a significant materiality threshold to be determined by the Board. The IETF LLC 
Board is expected to delegate management of day-to-day activities and related decision-making to staff.</t>
        <t>Per Section 5(d) of the LLC Agreement and as also described in
	<xref target="principles" format="default"/> of this document, the Board shall, 
as appropriate, act transparently and provide the IETF community with an opportunity to review 
and discuss any proposed changes to the IETF LLC structure prior to their adoption.</t>
        <t>The role of the Board is to ensure that the strategy and conduct of the IETF LLC is consistent with the IETF's needs -- both its concrete needs and its needs for transparency and accountability.  The Board is not intended to directly define the IETF's needs; to the extent that is required, the IETF community should document its needs in consensus-based RFCs (e.g., as the community did in <xref target="RFC8718" format="default"/>) and provide more detailed input via consultations with the Board (such as takes place on email discussion lists or at IETF meetings).</t>
        <t>Key IETF LLC Board responsibilities include:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Setting broad strategic direction for the LLC.</li>
          <li>Hiring or terminating an IETF Executive Director (or amending the terms of their engagement).</li>
          <li>Delegating management of day-to-day activities and related decision-making to staff.</li>
          <li>Adopting any employee benefit plans.</li>
          <li>Consulting the relevant IETF communities on matters related to the LLC, as appropriate.</li>
          <li>Approving any changes to the LLC governance structure.</li>
          <li>Adopting an annual budget and, as necessary, incur any debt.</li>
          <li>Preparing accurate and timely financial statements for ISOC, in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles.</li>
          <li>Providing assistance to help facilitate ISOC's tax compliance, including but not limited to assistance related to preparing the Form 990 and responding to any United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) questions and audits.</li>
          <li>Approving entering into agreements that meet a significant materiality threshold to be 
determined by the Board.</li>
          <li>Limiting its activities to the purposes as set forth in Section 4 of the LLC Agreement, in a manner 
consistent with ISOC's charitable purposes.</li>
          <li>Establishing an investment policy.</li>
          <li>Using best efforts to conduct all of its activities in strict compliance with the LLC Agreement and all 
applicable laws, rules, and regulations.</li>
          <li>Ensuring that IETF LLC is run in a manner that is transparent and accountable to the IETF community.</li>
          <li>Developing policies, including those noted in <xref target="llc-policies" format="default"/>, procedures, and a compliance program.</li>
          <li>Obtaining Commercial General Liability and other appropriate insurance policies, with
agreed-upon coverage limits.</li>

        <name>Board Design Goals</name>
        <t>A goal of this Board composition is to balance the need for the IETF LLC to be accountable to the IETF community with the need for this Board to have the expertise necessary to oversee a small non-profit company. The Board is smaller than the previous IAOC and the other leadership bodies of the IETF, in part to keep the Board focused on its rather limited set of strategic responsibilities as noted in <xref target="board-responsibilities" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>This board structure, with limited strategic responsibilities noted in <xref target="board-responsibilities" format="default"/> and limited size, together with the staff responsibilities noted in <xref target="staff-responsibilities" format="default"/>, is designed to overcome the challenges described in

concerning oversight. This establishes a clear line of oversight over staff performance: the IETF LLC Board oversees the IETF Executive Director's performance and has actual legal authority to remove a non-performing IETF Executive Director. The IETF Executive Director is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the IETF LLC.</t>
        <t>Finally, the Board is expected to operate transparently, to further address the concern raised in 
<xref target="I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs" section="3.3" sectionFormat="of"/>. The default transparency rule arrived at during the IASA 2.0 design process is detailed in <xref target="principles" format="default"/>. The Board will need to establish how it will meet that commitment.</t>

      <name>IETF LLC Board Membership, Selection, and Accountability</name>
      <t>The section outlines the composition of the IETF LLC Board, selection of IETF LLC Board Directors, and related details.</t>
      <section anchor="board-composition" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Board Composition</name>
        <t>There is a minimum of 5 directors, which is expandable to 6 or 7.
	The IETF LLC Board is comprised of the following:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>1 IETF Chair or delegate selected by the IESG</li>
          <li>1 Appointed by the ISOC Board of Trustees</li>
          <li>3 Selected by the IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom), confirmed by the IESG</li>
          <li>Up to 2 Appointed by the IETF LLC Board itself, on an as-needed basis, confirmed by the IESG</li>
        </ul>
        <t>For the first slot listed above, the presumption is that the IETF
Chair will serve on the board. At the IESG's discretion, another area
director may serve instead, or exceptionally the IESG may run a
selection process to appoint a director. The goal of having this slot
on the board is to maintain coordination and communication between the
board and the IESG.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="llc-directors" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>IETF LLC-Appointed Directors</name>
        <t>As noted above, a maximum of two Directors may be appointed by the
IETF LLC Board. They can obviously choose to appoint none, one, or
two. These appointments need not be on an exceptional basis; they
can be routine, and may occur at any time of the year since it is
on an as-needed basis.</t>
        <t>The appointment of a Board-appointed Director requires a two-thirds
majority vote of the Directors then in office, and the appointee shall
take office immediately upon appointment and IESG confirmation. The term of each appointment
is designated by the Board, with the maximum term being three years,
or until their earlier resignation, removal, or death.  The Board may
decide on a case-by-case basis how long each term shall be, factoring
in the restriction for consecutive terms in <xref target="term-limit" format="default"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="director-recruitment" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Recruiting IETF LLC Board Directors</name>
        <t>The Board itself is expected to take an active role in recruiting potential new Directors, regardless of the process that may be used to appoint them. In particular, the NomCom is primarily focused on considering requirements expressed by the Board and others, reviewing community feedback on candidates, conducting candidate interviews, and ultimately appointing Directors. The  Board and others can recruit potential Directors and get them into the consideration process of the NomCom or into open consideration processes of the other appointing bodies if those bodies choose to use such processes.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="term-length" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>IETF LLC Board Director Term Length</name>
        <t>The term length for a Director is three years. The exceptions to this
guideline are:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The terms for some Directors during the first full formation of
the IETF LLC Board in order to establish staggered terms and for any
appointments to fill a vacancy.</li>
          <li>The Director slot occupied by the IETF Chair ex officio or a
delegate selected by the IESG will serve a two-year term. This
applies regardless of whether the appointed individual is on the
IESG, rotates off the IESG during the two-year term, or is not on
the IESG. This makes the term length for this slot the same as the
term lengths established in <xref target="RFC8713" section="3.4" sectionFormat="comma" format="default"/>.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section anchor="term-limit" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>IETF LLC Board Director Limit</name>
        <t>A director may serve no more than two consecutive terms. 
A director cannot serve a third term until three years have 
passed since their second consecutive term. An
exception is if a Director role is occupied by the IETF Chair ex
officio, since that person's service is governed instead by the term
lengths established in <xref target="RFC8713" section="3.4" sectionFormat="comma" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>The term limits specified above apply to an individual, even if that
individual is appointed in different ways over time. For example, an
individual appointed to two terms by the ISOC Board of Trustees
may not immediately be appointed to a third term by the IETF
NomCom. A Director appointed by the IETF LLC itself may only
serve for one term by that appointment method, and any subsequent
terms would have to be via other methods; in any case, the term
limits above apply to that individual.</t>
        <t>Lastly, partial terms of less than three years for the initial appointments to the first full Board, for which some Directors will have terms of one or two years, do not count against the term limit.</t>
        <t>The limit on consecutive terms supports the healthy regular introduction of new ideas and energy into the Board and mitigates potential long-term risk of ossification or conflict, without adversely impacting the potential pool of director candidates over time.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="staggered-terms" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Staggered Terms</name>
        <t>The Internet Society Board of Trustees, the IESG, the Nominating Committee, and the
IETF LLC Board are expected to coordinate with each other to ensure that
collectively their appointment or selection processes provide for no
more than three Directors' terms concluding in the same year.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="director-removal" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>IETF LLC Board Director Removal</name>
        <t>NomCom-appointed and IESG-appointed Directors may be removed with or without cause. A vote in favor of
removal must be no fewer than the number of Directors less two.  So
for example, if there are seven directors, then five votes are
required. Directors may also be removed via the IETF recall process
defined in <xref target="RFC8713" section="7" sectionFormat="comma" format="default"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="director-vacancy" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Filling an IETF LLC Board Director Vacancy</name>
        <t>It shall be the responsibility of each respective body that appointed or selected a Director that vacates the Board 
to appoint a new Director to fill the vacancy.  For example, if a Director selected by the NomCom departs the Board 
prior to the end of their term for whatever reason, then it is the responsibility of the NomCom (using its mid-term 
rules, as specified in <xref target="RFC8713" section="3.5" sectionFormat="comma" format="default"/>) as the original appointing body to designate a 
replacement that will serve out the remainder of the term of the departed Director.  However, this obligation will 
not apply to vacancies in Board-appointed positions.</t>

        <t>At all meetings of the Board, two-thirds of the Directors then in office shall constitute 
a quorum for the transaction of business. Unless a greater affirmative vote is expressly required for 
an action under applicable law, the LLC Agreement, or an applicable Board policy, the affirmative vote of

    <section anchor="ietf-llc-funding" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>IETF LLC Funding</name>
      <t>The IETF LLC must function within a budget of costs balanced against limited revenues. The IETF community expects 
the IETF LLC to work to attain that goal, in order to maintain a viable support function that provides the 
environment within which the work of the IETF, IAB, IRTF, and RFC Editor can remain vibrant and productive.</t>
      <t>The IETF LLC was generating income from a few key sources at the time that this document was written, as enumerated below.

        <t>In addition to these official financial statements and forms, the IETF LLC is also expected to report on a regular basis 
to the IETF community on the current and future annual budget, budget forecasts vs. actuals over the course of a fiscal

        <t>Meeting revenues are another important source of funding that supports the IETF, coming mainly from the fees paid 
by IETF meeting participants. The IETF Executive Director sets those meeting fees, in consultation with other IETF 
LLC staff and the IETF community, with approval by the IETF LLC Board. Setting these fees and projecting the number

        <t>Sponsorships and donations are an essential component of the financial support for the IETF. Within the general 
bounds noted in <xref target="fundraising-practices" format="default"/>, the IETF LLC is responsible for fundraising activities in order 
to establish, maintain, and grow a strong foundation of donation revenues. This can and does include both 
direct financial contributions as well as in-kind contributions, such as equipment, software licenses, and services.</t>
        <t>Sponsorships and donations to the IETF LLC do not (and must not) convey to sponsors and donors any special oversight 
or direct influence over the IETF's technical work or other activities of the IETF or IETF LLC. This helps 
ensure that no undue influence may be ascribed to those from whom funds are raised, and so helps to maintain 
an open and consensus-based IETF standards process.</t>
        <t>To the extent that the IETF LLC needs to undertake any significant special projects for the IETF, the IETF LLC 
may need to fundraise distinctly for those special projects. As a result, the IETF LLC may conduct fundraising to support 
the IETF in general as well as one or more special fundraising efforts (which may also be accounted for distinctly and be held in a separate bank account or investment, as needed).</t>

A key part of this responsibility is establishing, maintaining, and successfully meeting an annual budget. This

with ISOC, sponsors, and donors that funds are being appropriately spent, and that financial oversight is being conducted 
properly. This is also essential to the IETF LLC meeting applicable legal and tax requirements and is a core part of 
the Board's fiduciary responsibilities.</t>
