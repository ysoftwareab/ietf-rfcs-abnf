      <t>This document describes a mechanism for a restarting router to signal
      to its neighbors that it is restarting, allowing them to reestablish
      their adjacencies without cycling through the DOWN state while still
      correctly initiating database synchronization.</t>
      <t>This document additionally describes a mechanism for a router to
      signal its neighbors that it is preparing to initiate a restart while
      maintaining forwarding-plane state. This allows the neighbors to
      maintain their adjacencies until the router has restarted but also
      allows the neighbors
      to bring the adjacencies down in the event of other
      topology changes.</t>
      <t>This document additionally describes a mechanism for a restarting
      router to determine when it has achieved Link State Protocol Data Unit
      (LSP) database synchronization with its neighbors and a mechanism to
      optimize LSP database synchronization while minimizing transient
      routing disruption when a router starts.</t>

      <name>Overview</name>
      <t>The Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing
      protocol <xref target="RFC1195" format="default"/> <xref
      target="ISO10589" format="default"/> is a link state intra-domain routing
      protocol. Normally, when an IS-IS router is restarted, temporary
      disruption of routing occurs due to events in both the restarting router
      and the neighbors of the restarting router.</t>
      <t>The router that has been restarted computes its own routes before
      achieving database synchronization with its neighbors. The results of
      this computation are likely to be non-convergent with the routes
      computed by other routers in the area/domain.</t>
      <t>Neighbors of the restarting router detect the restart event and cycle
      their adjacencies with the restarting router through the DOWN state. The
      cycling of the adjacency state causes the neighbors to regenerate their
      LSPs describing the adjacency concerned. This in turn causes a temporary
      disruption of routes passing through the restarting router.</t>
      <t>In certain scenarios, the temporary disruption of the routes is
      highly undesirable. This document describes mechanisms to avoid or
      minimize the disruption due to both of these causes.</t>
      <t>When an adjacency is reinitialized as a result of a neighbor
      restarting, a router does three things:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
        <li>It causes its own LSP(s) to be regenerated, thus triggering
	Shortest Path First (SPF)
          runs throughout the area (or in the case of Level 2, throughout the
          domain).</li>
        <li>It sets SRMflags on its own LSP database on the adjacency
          concerned.</li>
        <li>In the case of a Point-to-Point link, it transmits a complete set
          of Complete Sequence Number PDUs (CSNPs), over the adjacency.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>In the case of a restarting router process, the first of these is
      highly undesirable, but the second is essential in order to ensure
      synchronization of the LSP database.</t>
      <t>The third action above minimizes the number of LSPs that must be
      exchanged and, if made reliable, provides a means of determining when
      the LSP databases of the neighboring routers have been synchronized.
      This is desirable whether or not the router is being restarted (so that
      the overload bit can be cleared in the router's own LSP, for
      example).</t>
      <t>This document describes a mechanism for a restarting router to signal
      to its neighbors that it is restarting. The mechanism further allows the
      neighbors to reestablish their adjacencies with the restarting router
      without cycling through the DOWN state while still correctly initiating
      database synchronization.</t>
      <t>This document additionally describes a mechanism for a restarting
      router to determine when it has achieved LSP database synchronization
      with its neighbors and a mechanism to optimize LSP database
      synchronization and minimize transient routing disruption when a router
      starts.</t>
      <t>It is assumed that the three-way handshake <xref target="RFC5303" format="default"/>
      is being used on Point-to-Point circuits.</t>

      <name>Conventions Used in This Document</name>
      <t>If the control and forwarding functions in a router can be maintained
      independently, it is possible for the forwarding function state to be
      maintained across a resumption of control function operations. This
      functionality is assumed when the terms "restart/restarting" are used in
      this document.</t>
      <t>The terms "start/starting" are used to refer to a router in which the
      control function has either commenced operations for the first time or
      has resumed operations, but the forwarding functions have not been
      maintained in a prior state.</t>
      <t>The terms "(re)start/(re)starting" are used when the text is
      applicable to both a "starting" and a "restarting" router.</t>
      <t>The terms "normal IIH" or "IIH normal" refer to IS-IS Hellos (IIHs)
      in which the Restart TLV (defined later in this document) has no flags
      set.</t>

        <name>Timers</name>
        <t>Three additional timers (T1, T2, and T3) are required to support
        the mechanisms defined in this document. Timers T1 and T2 are used
        both by a restarting router and a starting router. Timer T3 is used
        only by a restarting router.</t>
        <t>NOTE: These timers are NOT applicable to a router that is
        preparing to do a planned restart.</t>
        <t>An instance of the timer T1 is maintained per interface and
        indicates the time after which an unacknowledged (re)start attempt
        will be repeated. A typical value is 3 seconds.</t>
        <t>An instance of the timer T2 is maintained for each LSP database
        (LSPDB) present in the system. For example, for a Level 1/2 system,
        there will be an instance of the timer T2 for Level 1 and an instance
        for Level 2. This is the maximum time that the system will wait for
        LSPDB synchronization. A typical value is 60 seconds.</t>
        <t>A single instance of the timer T3 is maintained for the entire
        system. It indicates the time after which the router will declare that
        it has failed to achieve database synchronization (by setting the
        overload bit in its own LSP). This is initialized to 65535 seconds
        but is set to the minimum of the remaining times of received IIHs
        containing a Restart TLV with the Restart Acknowledgement (RA) set and
        an indication that the neighbor has an adjacency in the UP state to
        the restarting router. (See <xref target="itema" format="none">item a</xref> in <xref target="useofrrrabitssection"/>.)</t>

        <name>Restart TLV</name>
        <t>A new TLV is defined to be included in IIH PDUs. The TLV includes
        flags that are used to convey information during a (re)start. The
        absence of this TLV indicates that the sender supports none of the
        functionality defined in this document. Therefore, if a router
        supports any of the functionality defined in this document it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include this TLV in all transmitted IIHs.</t>

        <t>Note: Very early draft versions of the restart functionality

        RFC 5306 allowed for the possibility of interoperating with 
        legacy implementations by stating that a router that 
        is expecting an RA on a LAN circuit should assume that the
        acknowledgement is directed at the local system if the TLV
        is received with RA set and Restarting Neighbor System ID
        is not present. It is an implementation choice whether to
        continue to accept (on a LAN) a TLV with RA set and
        Restarting Neighbor System ID absent. Note that the omission
        of the Restarting Neighbor System ID only introduces ambiguity
        in the case where there are multiple systems on a LAN
        simultaneously performing restart.</t>

          <name>Use of RR and RA Bits</name>
          <t>The RR bit is used by a (re)starting router to signal to its
          neighbors that a (re)start is in progress, that an existing
          adjacency <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be maintained even under circumstances when the
          normal operation of the adjacency state machine would require the
          adjacency to be reinitialized, to request a set of CSNPs, and to
          request setting of the SRMflags.</t>
          <t>The RA bit is sent by the neighbor of a (re)starting router to
          acknowledge the receipt of a Restart TLV with the RR bit set.</t>
          <t>When the neighbor of a (re)starting router receives an IIH with
          the Restart TLV having the RR bit set, if there exists on this
          interface an adjacency in the UP state with the same System ID and, in
          the case of a LAN circuit, with the same source LAN address, then
          irrespective of the other contents of the "Intermediate System
          Neighbors" option (LAN circuits) or the "Point-to-Point Three-Way
          Adjacency" option (Point-to-Point circuits):</t>

              first IIH with the RR bit set that this system has received

              being in "Restart mode" and the adjacency Holding Time is
              refreshed -- otherwise, the Holding Time is not refreshed. The
              Remaining Time transmitted according to (b) below <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reflect

              Receipt of an IIH with the RR bit reset will clear the "Restart
              mode" state. This procedure allows the restarting router to
              cause the neighbor to maintain the adjacency long enough for
              restart to successfully complete while also preventing
              repetitive restarts from maintaining an adjacency indefinitely.

              the corresponding interface an IIH including the Restart TLV
              with the RR bit clear and the RA bit set, in the case of
              Point-to-Point adjacencies having updated the "Point-to-Point
              Three-Way Adjacency" option to reflect any new values received
              from the (re)starting router. (This allows a restarting router
              to quickly acquire the correct information to place in its
              hellos.) The Remaining Time <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to the current time
              (in seconds) before the holding timer on this adjacency is due

              acknowledgement and Holding Time in the case where multiple
              systems on a LAN restart at approximately the same time. This

          generated by this router in its previous incarnation may exist in
          the LSP databases of other routers in the network. These copies are
          likely to appear "newer" than LSPs initially generated by the
          starting router due to the reinitialization of LSP fragment sequence
          numbers by the starting router. This may cause temporary blackholes
          to occur until the normal operation of the update process causes the
          starting router to regenerate and flood copies of its own LSPs with
          higher sequence numbers. The temporary blackholes can be avoided if
          the starting router's neighbors suppress advertising an adjacency to

              adjacency long enough for restart to successfully complete.
              Whether or not an adjacency is marked as being in Planned
              Restart State has no effect on adjacency state transitions.</li>
            <li>immediately (i.e., without waiting for any currently running
              timer interval to expire, but with a small random delay of a few
              tens of milliseconds on LANs to avoid "storms") transmit over
              the corresponding interface an IIH including the Restart TLV
              with the PR bit clear and the PA bit set. The Remaining Time
              <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to the current time (in seconds) before the holding
              timer on this adjacency is due to expire. If the corresponding
              interface is a LAN interface, then the Restarting Neighbor
              System ID <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be set to the System ID of the router from
              which the IIH with the PR bit set was received. This is required
              to correctly associate the acknowledgement and Holding Time in
              the case where multiple systems on a LAN are planning a restart
              at approximately the same time.</li>
          </ol>
          <t>NOTE: Receipt of an IIH with PA bit set indicates to the router
          planning a restart that the neighbor is aware of the planned restart
          and -- in the absence of topology changes as described below -- will
          maintain the adjacency for the Remaining Time included in the IIH
          with PA set.</t>
          <t>By definition, a restarting router maintains forwarding state
          across the control-plane restart (see <xref target="conventions"/>). But while a
          control-plane restart is in progress, it is expected that the
          restarting router will be unable to respond to topology changes. It
          is therefore useful to signal a planned restart so that the
          neighbors of the restarting router can determine whether it is safe
          to maintain the adjacency if other topology changes occur prior to
          the completion of the restart. Signaling a planned restart in the
          absence of maintained forwarding-plane state is likely to lead to
          significant traffic loss and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be done.</t>
          <t>Neighbors of the router that have signaled planned restart <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
          maintain the adjacency in a Planned Restart State until it receives
          an IIH with the RR bit set, it receives an IIH with both PR and RR bits
          clear, or the adjacency Holding Time expires -- whichever occurs
          first. Neighbors that choose not to follow the recommended behavior
          need to consider the impact on traffic delivery of not using the
          restarting router for forwarding traffic during the restart
          period.</t>
          <t>While the adjacency is in Planned Restart State, some or all of
          the following actions <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be taken:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="a">
            <li>If additional topology changes occur, the adjacency that is
              in Planned Restart State <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be brought down even though the
              Holding Time has not yet expired. Given that the neighbor that has
              signaled a planned restart is not expected to update its
              forwarding plane in response to signaling of the topology
              changes (since it is restarting) traffic that transits that
              node is at risk of being improperly forwarded. On a LAN circuit,
              if the router in Planned Restart State is the DIS at any
              supported level, the adjacency or adjacencies <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be brought down
              whenever any LSP update is either generated or received so as
              to trigger a new DIS election. Failure to do so will compromise
              the reliability of the update process on that circuit. What
              other criteria are used to determine what topology changes will
              trigger bringing the adjacency down is a local implementation
              decision.</li>
            <li>If a Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) <xref target="RFC5880" format="default"/> Session to the neighbor
              that signals a planned restart is in the UP state and
              subsequently goes down, the event <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be ignored since it is
              possible this is an expected side effect of the restart. Use of
              the Control-Plane Independent state as signaled in BFD control
              packets <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be considered in the decision to ignore a BFD
              Session DOWN event.</li>
            <li>On a Point-to-Point circuit, transmission of LSPs, CSNPs, and
              Partial Sequence Number PDU (PSNPs) <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be suppressed. It is expected that the PDUs will not
              be received.</li>

        <t>Adjacency (re)acquisition is the first step in (re)initialization.

          <name>Adjacency Reacquisition during Restart</name>
          <t>The restarting router explicitly notifies its neighbor that the
          adjacency is being reacquired and, hence, that it <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>
          reinitialize the adjacency. This is achieved by setting the RR bit
          in the Restart TLV. When the neighbor of a restarting router
          receives an IIH with the Restart TLV having the RR bit set, if there
          exists on this interface an adjacency in the UP state with the same
          System ID and, in the case of a LAN circuit, with the same source
          LAN address, then the procedures described in <xref target="useofrrrabitssection"/> are
          followed.</t>
          <t>A router that does not support the restart capability will ignore
          the Restart TLV and reinitialize the adjacency as normal, returning
          an IIH without the Restart TLV.</t>
          <t>On restarting, a router initializes the timer T3, starts the
          timer T2 for each LSPDB, and for each interface (and in the case of
          a LAN circuit, for each level) starts the timer T1 and transmits an
          IIH containing the Restart TLV with the RR bit set.</t>
          <t>On a Point-to-Point circuit, the restarting router <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> set the
          "Adjacency Three-Way State" to "Init", because the receipt of the
          acknowledging IIH (with RA set) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> cause the adjacency to enter
          the UP state immediately.</t>
          <t>On a LAN circuit, the LAN-ID assigned to the circuit <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be
          the same as that used prior to the restart. In particular, for any
          circuits for which the restarting router was previously DIS, the use
          of a different LAN-ID would necessitate the generation of a new set
          of pseudonode LSPs and corresponding changes in all the LSPs
          referencing them from other routers on the LAN. By preserving the
          LAN-ID across the restart, this churn can be prevented. To enable a
          restarting router to learn the LAN-ID used prior to restart, the
          LAN-ID specified in an IIH with RR set <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored.</t>
          <t>Transmission of "normal IIHs" is inhibited until the conditions
          described below are met (in order to avoid causing an unnecessary
          adjacency initialization). Upon expiry of the timer T1, it is
          restarted and the IIH is retransmitted as above.</t>
          <t>When a restarting router receives an IIH a local adjacency is
          established as usual, and if the IIH contains a Restart TLV with the
          RA bit set (and on LAN circuits with a Restart Neighbor System ID
          that matches that of the local system), the receipt of the
          acknowledgement over that interface is noted. When the RA bit is set
          and the state of the remote adjacency is UP, then the timer T3 is
          set to the minimum of its current value and the value of the
          Remaining Time field in the received IIH.</t>
          <t>On a Point-to-Point link, receipt of an IIH not containing the
          Restart TLV is also treated as an acknowledgement, since it
          indicates that the neighbor is not restart capable. However, since
          no CSNP is guaranteed to be received over this interface, the timer
          T1 is canceled immediately without waiting for a complete set of
          CSNPs. Synchronization may therefore be deemed complete even though
          there are some LSPs that are held (only) by this neighbor (see
          <xref target="dbsyncsection"/>). In this case, we also want to be certain that the
          neighbor will reinitialize the adjacency in order to guarantee that
          the SRMflags have been set on its database, thus ensuring eventual
          LSPDB synchronization. This is guaranteed to happen except in the
          case where the Adjacency Three-Way State in the received IIH is UP
          and the Neighbor Extended Local Circuit ID matches the Extended
          Local Circuit ID assigned by the restarting router. In this case,
          the restarting router <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> force the adjacency to reinitialize by
          setting the local Adjacency Three-Way State to DOWN and sending a
          normal IIH.</t>
          <t>In the case of a LAN interface, receipt of an IIH not containing
          the Restart TLV is unremarkable since synchronization can still
          occur so long as at least one of the non-restarting neighboring
          routers on the LAN supports restart. Therefore, T1 continues to run
          in this case. If none of the neighbors on the LAN are restart
          capable, T1 will eventually expire after the locally defined number
          of retries.</t>
          <t>In the case of a Point-to-Point circuit, the LocalCircuitID and
          Extended Local Circuit ID information contained in the IIH can be
          used immediately to generate an IIH containing the correct three-way
          handshake information. The presence of Neighbor Extended Local
          Circuit ID information that does not match the value currently in
          use by the local system is ignored (since the IIH may have been
          transmitted before the neighbor had received the new value from the
          restarting router), but the adjacency remains in the initializing
          state until the correct information is received.</t>
          <t>In the case of a LAN circuit, the source neighbor information
          (e.g., SNPAAddress) is recorded and used for adjacency establishment
          and maintenance as normal.</t>
          <t>When BOTH a complete set of CSNPs (for each active level, in the
          case of a Point-to-Point circuit) and an acknowledgement have been
          received over the interface, the timer T1 is canceled.</t>
          <t>Once the timer T1 has been canceled, subsequent IIHs are
          transmitted according to the normal algorithms but including the
          Restart TLV with both RR and RA clear.</t>
          <t>If a LAN contains a mixture of systems, only some of which
          support the new algorithm, database synchronization is still
          guaranteed, but the "old" systems will have reinitialized their
          adjacencies.</t>
          <t>If an interface is active but does not have any neighboring
          router reachable over that interface, the timer T1 would never be
          canceled, and according to <xref target="restartingsection"/>, the SPF would never be
          run. Therefore, timer T1 is canceled after some predetermined
          number of expirations (which <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be 1).</t>

          <t>The starting router wants to ensure that in the event that a

          is achieved by sending IIHs with the RR bit clear and the SA bit set
          in the Restart TLV. The RR bit remains clear and the SA bit remains

          TLV with the RR bit clear and SA bit set. Upon expiry of the timer
          T1, it is restarted and the IIH is retransmitted with both RR and SA

        together with their remaining lifetime. In the case of a LAN

        neighbors that are not restarting. If there are multiple interfaces on
        the (re)starting router, the recorded set of LSPIDs is the union of

        <t>As LSPs are received (by the normal operation of the update
        process) over any interface, the corresponding LSPID entry is removed
        (it is also removed if an LSP arrives before the CSNP containing the
        reference). When an LSPID has been held in the list for its indicated
        remaining lifetime, it is removed from the list. When the list of
        LSPIDs is empty and the timer T1 has been canceled for all the

        time of (re)starting may or may not be present, but the normal
        operation of the update process will guarantee that they will
        eventually be received. At this point, the local database is deemed to

        <t>Since LSPs mentioned in the CSNP(s) with a zero remaining lifetime

          <t>The operation of a router starting, as opposed to restarting, is

            <name>Restarting</name>
            <t>In order to avoid causing unnecessary routing churn in other
            routers, it is highly desirable that the router's own LSPs
            generated by the restarting system are the same as those
            previously present in the network (assuming no other changes have
            taken place). It is important therefore not to regenerate and
            flood the LSPs until all the adjacencies have been reestablished
            and any information required for propagation into the local LSPs
            is fully available. Ideally, the information is loaded into the
            LSPs in a deterministic way, such that the same information occurs
            in the same place in the same LSP (and hence the LSPs are
            identical to their previous versions). If this can be achieved,
            the new versions may not even cause SPF to be run in other
            systems. However, provided the same information is included in the
            set of LSPs (albeit in a different order, and possibly different
            LSPs), the result of running the SPF will be the same and will not
            cause churn to the forwarding tables.</t>
            <t>In the case of a restarting router, none of the router's own
            LSPs are transmitted, nor are the router's own forwarding tables
            updated while the timer T3 is running.</t>
            <t>Redistribution of inter-level information <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be regenerated
            before this router's LSP is flooded to other nodes. Therefore, the
            Level-n non-pseudonode LSP(s) <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be flooded until the other
            level's T2 timer has expired and its SPF has been run. This
            ensures that any inter-level information that is to be propagated
            can be included in the Level-n LSP(s).</t>
            <t>During this period, if one of the router's own (including
            pseudonodes) LSPs is received, which the local router does not
            currently have in its own database, it is NOT purged. Under normal
            operation, such an LSP would be purged, since the LSP clearly
            should not be present in the global LSP database. However, in the
            present circumstances, this would be highly undesirable, because
            it could cause premature removal of a router's own LSP -- and
            hence churn in remote routers. Even if the local system has one or
            more of the router's own LSPs (which it has generated but not yet
            transmitted), it is still not valid to compare the received LSP
            against this set, since it may be that as a result of propagation
            between Level 1 and Level 2 (or vice versa), a further router's
            own LSP will need to be generated when the LSP databases have
            synchronized.</t>
            <t>During this period, a restarting router <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send CSNPs as it
            normally would. Information about the router's own LSPs <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be
            included, but if it is included, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be based on LSPs that have
            been received, not on versions that have been generated (but not
            yet transmitted). This restriction is necessary to prevent
            premature removal of an LSP from the global LSP database.</t>
            <t>When the timer T2 expires or is canceled, indicating that
            synchronization for that level is complete, the SPF for that level
            is run in order to derive any information that is required to be
            propagated to another level, but the forwarding tables are not yet
            updated.</t>
            <t>Once the other level's SPF has run and any inter-level
            propagation has been resolved, the router's own LSPs can be
            generated and flooded. Any own LSPs that were previously ignored,
            but that are not part of the current set of own LSPs (including
            pseudonodes), <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> then be purged. Note that it is possible that a
            Designated Router change may have taken place and, consequently,
            the router <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> purge those pseudonode LSPs that it previously
            owned but that are now no longer part of its set of pseudonode
            LSPs.</t>
            <t>When all the T2 timers have expired or been canceled, the
            timer T3 is canceled, and the local forwarding tables are
            updated.</t>
            <t>If the timer T3 expires before all the T2 timers have expired
            or been canceled, this indicates that the synchronization process
            is taking longer than the minimum Holding Time of the neighbors.
            The router's own LSP(s) for levels that have not yet completed
            their first SPF computation are then flooded with the overload bit
            set to indicate that the router's LSPDB is not yet synchronized
            (and therefore other routers <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> compute routes through this
            router). Normal operation of the update process resumes, and the
            local forwarding tables are updated. In order to prevent the
            neighbor's adjacencies from expiring, IIHs with the normal
            interface value for the Holding Time are transmitted over all
            interfaces with neither RR nor RA set in the Restart TLV. This
            will cause the neighbors to refresh their adjacencies. The
            router's own LSP(s) will continue to have the overload bit set
            until timer T2 has expired or been canceled.</t>

          <section numbered="true" toc="default">
            <name>Starting</name>
            <t>In the case of a starting router, as soon as each adjacency is
            established, and before any CSNP exchanges, the router's own
            zeroth LSP is transmitted with the overload bit set. This prevents
            other routers from computing routes through the router until it
            has reliably acquired the complete set of LSPs. The overload bit
            remains set in subsequent transmissions of the zeroth LSP (such as
            will occur if a previous copy of the router's own zeroth LSP is
            still present in the network) while any timer T2 is running.</t>
            <t>When all the T2 timers have been canceled, the router's own
            LSP(s) <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be regenerated with the overload bit clear (assuming
            the router is not in fact overloaded, and there is no other
            reason, such as incomplete BGP convergence, to keep the overload
            bit set) and flooded as normal.</t>
            <t>Other LSPs owned by this router (including pseudonodes) are
            generated and flooded as normal, irrespective of the timer T2. The
            SPF is also run as normal and the Routing Information Base (RIB)
            and Forwarding Information Base (FIB) updated as routes become
            available.</t>
            <t>To avoid the possible formation of temporary blackholes, the
            starting router sets the SA bit in the Restart TLV (as described
            in <xref target="adjacencyacqsection"/>) in all IIHs that it sends.</t>
            <t>When all T2 timers have been canceled, the starting router
            <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> transmit IIHs with the SA bit clear.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>Any new security issues raised by the procedures in this document
      depend upon the ability of an attacker to inject a false but apparently
      valid IIH, the ease/difficulty of which has not been altered.</t>
      <t>If the RR bit is set in a false IIH, neighbors who receive such an
      IIH will continue to maintain an existing adjacency in the UP state
      and may (re)send a complete set of CSNPs. While the latter action is
      wasteful, neither action causes any disruption in correct protocol
      operation.</t>
      <t>If the RA bit is set in a false IIH, a (re)starting router that
      receives such an IIH may falsely believe that there is a neighbor on the
      corresponding interface that supports the procedures described in this
      document. In the absence of receipt of a complete set of CSNPs on that
      interface, this could delay the completion of (re)start procedures by
      requiring the timer T1 to time out the locally defined maximum number of
      retries. This behavior is the same as would occur on a LAN where none of
      the (re)starting router's neighbors support the procedures in this
      document and is covered in Sections <xref
      target="adjacencyreacqsection" format="counter"/> and <xref
      target="adjacencyacqsection" format="counter"/>.</t>
      <t>If the SA bit is set in a false IIH, this could cause suppression of
      the advertisement of an IS neighbor, which could either continue for an
      indefinite period or occur intermittently with the result being a
      possible loss of reachability to some destinations in the network and/or
      increased frequency of LSP flooding and SPF calculation.</t>
      <t>If the PR bit is set in a false IIH, neighbors who receive such an
      IIH could modify the Holding Time of an existing adjacency
      inappropriately. In the event of topology changes, the neighbor might
      also choose to not flood the topology updates and/or bring the adjacency
      down in the false belief that the forwarding plane of the router
      identified as the source of the false IIH is not currently processing
      announced topology changes. This would result in unnecessary forwarding
      disruption.</t>
      <t>If the PA bit is set in a false IIH, a router that receives such an
      IIH may falsely believe that the neighbor on the corresponding interface
      supports the planned restart procedures defined in this document. If
      such a router is planning to restart, it might then proceed to initiate a
      restart in the false expectation that the neighbor has updated its
      Holding Time as requested. This may result in the neighbor bringing down
      the adjacency while the receiving router is restarting, causing
      unnecessary disruption to forwarding.</t>
      <t>The possibility of IS-IS PDU spoofing can be reduced by the use of
      authentication, as described in <xref target="RFC1195" format="default"/>
      and <xref target="ISO10589" format="default"/>, and especially by
      the use of cryptographic authentication, as described in <xref target="RFC5304" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC5310" format="default"/>.</t>

      <name>Summary of Changes from RFC 5306</name>
      <t>This document extends RFC 5306 by introducing support for signaling
      the neighbors of a restarting router that a planned restart is about to
      occur. This allows the neighbors to be aware of the state of the
      restarting router so that appropriate action may be taken if other
      topology changes occur while the planned restart is in progress. Since
      the forwarding plane of the restarting router is maintained based upon
      the pre-restart state of the network, additional topology changes
      introduce the possibility that traffic may be lost if paths via the
      restarting router continue to be used while the restart is in
      progress.</t>
      <t>In support of this new functionality, two new flags have been
      introduced:</t>

<dl newline="false" spacing="normal" indent="2">
<dt>PR -</dt>
<dd>Restart is planned</dd>

<dt>PA -</dt>
<dd>Planned restart acknowledgement</dd>
</dl>

      <t>No changes to the post-restart exchange between the restarting router
      and its neighbors have been introduced.</t>
