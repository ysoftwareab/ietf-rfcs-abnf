      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The IETF specifies and uses Performance Metrics of protocols and
      applications transported over its protocols. Performance Metrics are
      an important part of network operations using IETF protocols, and <xref target="RFC6390" format="default"/> specifies guidelines for their development.</t>
      <t>The definition and use of Performance Metrics in the IETF have been
      fostered in various working groups (WGs). Most notably: </t>
      <ul empty="false" spacing="normal">
        <li>The "IP Performance Metrics" (IPPM) WG is the WG primarily
          focusing on Performance Metrics definition at the IETF.</li>
        <li>The "Benchmarking Methodology" WG (BMWG) defines many Performance
          Metrics for use in laboratory benchmarking of internetworking
          technologies.</li>
        <li>The "Metric Blocks for use with RTCP's Extended Report Framework"
          (XRBLOCK) WG (concluded) specified many Performance Metrics related
          to "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)" <xref target="RFC3611" format="default"/>, which establishes a framework to allow new
          information to be conveyed in RTCP, supplementing the original
          report blocks defined in "RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time
          Applications" <xref target="RFC3550" format="default"/>.</li>
        <li>The "IP Flow Information eXport" (IPFIX) WG (concluded) specified
          an Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) process for new
          Information Elements. Some Information Elements related to Performance
          Metrics are proposed on a regular basis.</li>
        <li>The "Performance Metrics for Other Layers" (PMOL) WG (concluded)
          defined some Performance Metrics related to Session Initiation
          Protocol (SIP) voice quality <xref target="RFC6035" format="default"/>.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>It is expected that more Performance Metrics will be defined in the
      future -- not only IP-based metrics but also metrics that are
      protocol specific and application specific.</t>
      <t>Despite the importance of Performance Metrics, there are two related
      problems for the industry:</t>

      <ul empty="false" spacing="normal">
        <li>First, ensuring that when one party requests that
      another party measure (or report or in some way act on) a particular
      Performance Metric, both parties have exactly the same
      understanding of what Performance Metric is being referred to.</li>
        <li>Second,
      discovering which Performance Metrics have been specified, to avoid
      developing a new Performance Metric that is very similar but not quite
      interoperable.</li>
      </ul>

     <t>These problems can be addressed by creating a Registry
      for Performance Metrics with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
      (IANA).   As such, this document defines the new IANA Registry for Performance
      Metrics.</t>

      <t>Per this document, IANA has created and now maintains the Performance
      Metrics Registry, according to the maintenance procedures and the
      format defined in the sections below. The resulting
      Performance Metrics Registry is for use by the IETF and others. Although
      the Registry formatting specifications herein are primarily for Registry
      creation by IANA, any other organization that wishes to create a
      Performance Metrics Registry may use the same formatting specifications
      for their purposes. The authors make no guarantee of the Registry
      format's applicability to any possible set of Performance Metrics
      envisaged by other organizations, but we encourage others to apply it. In
      the remainder of this document, unless we explicitly say otherwise, we
      will refer to the IANA-maintained Performance Metrics Registry as simply
      the Performance Metrics Registry.</t>

      <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
        <dt>Performance Metric:</dt>
        <dd>A quantitative measure of performance, targeted to an IETF-specified
          protocol or targeted to an application transported over an
          IETF-specified protocol. Examples of Performance Metrics are the FTP
          response time for a complete file download, the DNS Response time to
          resolve the IP address(es), a database logging time, etc. This
          definition is consistent with the definition of a metric in <xref
          target="RFC2330" format="default"/> and broader than the definition
          of a Performance Metric in <xref target="RFC6390" format="default"/>.</dd>
        <dt>Registered Performance Metric:</dt>
        <dd>A Performance Metric expressed as an entry in
          the Performance Metrics Registry, administered by IANA. Such a
          Performance Metric has met all of the Registry review criteria defined
          in this document in order to be included in the Registry.</dd>
        <dt>Performance Metrics Registry:</dt>
        <dd>The IANA Registry
          containing Registered Performance Metrics.</dd>
        <dt>Proprietary Registry:</dt>
        <dd>A set of metrics that are
          registered in a proprietary Registry, as opposed to the Performance
          Metrics Registry.</dd>
        <dt>Performance Metrics Experts:</dt>
        <dd>A group of designated experts <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/>
          selected by the IESG to validate the Performance Metrics before
          updating the Performance Metrics Registry. The Performance Metrics
          Experts work closely with IANA.</dd>
        <dt>Parameter:</dt>
        <dd>An input factor defined as a
          variable in the definition of a Performance Metric. A Parameter is a
          numerical or other specified factor forming one of a set that
          defines a metric or sets the conditions of its operation. All
          Parameters must be known in order to make a measurement using a
          metric and interpret the results. There are two types of Parameters:
          Fixed and Runtime. For the Fixed Parameters, the value
          of the variable is specified in the Performance Metrics Registry
          Entry and different Fixed Parameter values results in different
          Registered Performance Metrics. For the Runtime Parameters, the
          value of the variable is defined when the Metric Measurement Method
          is executed and a given Registered Performance Metric supports
          multiple values for the Parameter. Although Runtime Parameters do
          not change the fundamental nature of the Performance Metric's
          definition, some have substantial influence on the network property
          being assessed and interpretation of the results.</dd>
      </dl>

    <aside><t>Note: Consider the case of packet loss in the following two
              Active Measurement Method cases. The first case is packet loss
              as background loss where the Runtime Parameter set includes a
              very sparse Poisson stream and only characterizes the times
              when packets were lost. Actual user streams likely see much
              higher loss at these times, due to tail drop or radio errors.
              The second case is packet loss ratio as the complimentary
              probability of delivery ratio where
              the Runtime Parameter set includes a very dense, bursty stream,
              and characterizes the loss experienced by a stream that
              approximates a user stream. These are both "Loss metrics", but
              the difference in interpretation of the results is highly
              dependent on the Runtime Parameters (at least), to the extreme
              where we are actually using loss ratio to infer its complimentary
              probability: delivery ratio.</t></aside>

      <t>This document is intended for two different audiences:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
        <li>For those preparing a candidate Performance Metric, it provides
        criteria that the proposal <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> meet (see <xref
        target="metrics-criteria"/>). It also provides instructions for
        writing the text for each column of the candidate Performance Metric
        and the references required for the new Performance Metrics Registry
        Entry (up to and including the publication of one or more immutable
        documents such as an RFC) (see <xref target="columns"/>).</li>
        <li>For the appointed Performance Metrics Experts and for IANA
        personnel administering the new IANA Performance Metrics Registry, it
        defines a set of acceptance criteria against which a candidate
        Registered Performance Metric should be evaluated, and requirements
        for the composition of a candidate Performance Metric Registry Entry.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>Other organizations that standardize performance metrics are
      encouraged to use the process defined in this memo to propose a
      candidate Registered Performance Metric.  In addition, this document may
      be useful for other organizations who are defining a Performance Metrics
      Registry of their own and may reuse the features of the Performance
      Metrics Registry defined in this document.</t>

      <t>This Performance Metrics Registry is applicable to Performance
      Metrics derived from Active Measurement, Passive Measurement, and any
      other form of Performance Metric. This Registry is designed to encompass
      Performance Metrics developed throughout the IETF and especially for the
      technologies specified in the following working groups: IPPM, XRBLOCK,
      IPFIX, and BMWG. This document analyzes a prior attempt to set up a
      Performance Metrics Registry and the reasons why this design was
      inadequate <xref target="RFC6248" format="default"/>. </t>

      <name>Motivations for the Performance Metrics Registry</name>
      <t>In this section, we detail several motivations for the Performance
      Metrics Registry.</t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Interoperability</name>
        <t>As with any IETF Registry, the primary intention is to manage the
        registration of Identifiers for use within one or more protocols. In
        the particular case of the Performance Metrics Registry, there are two
        types of protocols that will use the Performance Metrics in the
        Performance Metrics Registry during their operation (by referring to
        the index values): </t>

          <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
           <dt>Control Protocol:</dt><dd>This type of protocol is used to allow one
            entity to request that another entity perform a measurement using a
            specific metric defined by the Performance Metrics Registry. One
            particular example is the Large-scale Measurement of Broadband
            Performance (LMAP) framework <xref target="RFC7594" format="default"/>.
            Using the LMAP terminology, the Performance Metrics Registry is
            used in the LMAP Control Protocol to allow a Controller to
            schedule a Measurement Task for one or more Measurement Agents. In
            order to enable this use case, the entries in the Performance
            Metrics Registry must be sufficiently defined to allow a
            Measurement Agent implementation to trigger a specific Measurement
            Task upon the reception of a Control Protocol message. This
            requirement heavily constrains the types of entries that are
            acceptable for the Performance Metrics Registry.</dd>
          <dt>Report Protocol:</dt><dd>This type of protocol is used to allow an entity to report Measurement Results to another entity.  By referencing to a specific Registered Performance Metric, it is
            possible to properly characterize the Measurement Result data
            being reported. Using the LMAP terminology, the Performance
            Metrics Registry is used in the LMAP Report Protocol to allow a
            Measurement Agent to report Measurement Results to a
            Collector.</dd>
</dl>
        <t> It should be noted that the LMAP framework explicitly allows
        for using not only the IANA-maintained Performance Metrics Registry
        but also other registries containing Performance Metrics, i.e.,
        either (1)&nbsp;registries defined by other organizations or (2)&nbsp;private registries. However, others who
        are creating registries to be used in the context of an LMAP framework
        are encouraged to use the Registry format defined in this document,
        because this makes it easier for developers of LMAP Measurement Agents
        to programmatically use information found in those other
        registries' entries.</t>

      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Single Point of Reference for Performance Metrics</name>
        <t>A Performance Metrics Registry serves as a single point of
        reference for Performance Metrics defined in different working groups
        in the IETF. As we mentioned earlier, there are several working groups that
        define Performance Metrics in the IETF, and it is hard to keep track of
        all of them. This results in multiple definitions of similar Performance
        Metrics that attempt to measure the same phenomena but in slightly
        different (and incompatible) ways. Having a Registry would allow the
        IETF community and others to have a single list of relevant
        Performance Metrics defined by the IETF (and others, where
        appropriate). The single list is also an essential aspect of
        communication about Performance Metrics, where different entities that
        request measurements, execute measurements, and report the results can
        benefit from a common understanding of the referenced Performance
        Metric.</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Side Benefits</name>
        <t>There are a couple of side benefits of having such a Registry.
        First, the Performance Metrics Registry could serve as an inventory of
        useful and used Performance Metrics that are normally supported by
        different implementations of Measurement Agents. Second, the results
        of measurements using the Performance Metrics should be comparable
        even if they are performed by different implementations and in
        different networks, as the Performance Metric is properly defined.
        BCP 176 <xref target="RFC6576" format="default"/> examines whether the
        results produced by independent implementations are equivalent in the
        context of evaluating the completeness and clarity of metric
        specifications. <xref target="RFC6576"/> is a BCP <xref
        target="RFC2026"/> that defines the Standards Track advancement
        testing for (Active) IPPM Metrics, and the same process will likely
        suffice to determine whether Registered Performance Metrics are
        sufficiently well specified to result in comparable (or equivalent)
        results. If a Registered Performance Metric has undergone such
        testing, this <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be noted in "Comments and Remarks"
        (see <xref target="remarks"/>), with a reference to the test
        results.</t>

      <t>The current approach learns from this by tightly defining each
      Registered Performance Metric with only a few variable (Runtime)
      Parameters to be specified by the measurement designer, if any. The idea
      is that entries in the Performance Metrics Registry stem from different
      Measurement Methods that require input (Runtime) Parameters to set
      factors like Source and Destination addresses (which do not change the
      fundamental nature of the measurement). The downside of this approach is
      that it could result in a large number of entries in the Performance
      Metrics Registry. There is agreement that less is more in this context --
      it is better to have a reduced set of useful metrics rather than a large
      set of metrics, some with questionable usefulness.</t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Why This Attempt Should Succeed</name>
        <t>As mentioned in the previous section, one of the main issues with
        the previous Registry was that the metrics contained in the Registry
        were too generic to be useful. This document specifies stricter
        criteria for Performance Metric registration (see <xref
        target="metrics-criteria"/>) and
        imposes a group of Performance Metrics Experts that will provide
        guidelines to assess if a Performance Metric is properly
        specified.</t>
        <t>Another key difference between this attempt and the previous one is
        that in this case there is at least one clear user for the Performance
        Metrics Registry: the LMAP framework and protocol. Because the LMAP
        protocol will use the Performance Metrics Registry values in its
        operation, this actually helps to determine if a metric is properly
        defined -- in particular, since we expect that the LMAP Control Protocol will enable
        a Controller to request that a Measurement Agent perform a measurement
        using a given metric by embedding the Performance Metrics Registry
        Identifier in the protocol. Such a metric and method are properly
        specified if they are defined well enough so that it is possible (and
        practical) to implement them in the Measurement Agent. This was the failure of the previous attempt: a Registry Entry with an undefined Type-P (<xref target="RFC2330" sectionFormat="of" section="13"/>) allows measurement results to vary significantly.</t>

      <name>Definition of the Performance Metrics Registry</name>
      <t>This Performance Metrics Registry is applicable to Performance
      Metrics used for Active Measurement, Passive Measurement, and any other
      form of Performance Measurement. Each category of measurement has unique
      properties, so some of the columns defined below are not applicable for
      a given metric category. In this case, the column(s) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be populated
      with the "N/A" value (Not Applicable). However, the "N/A" value <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
      be used by any metric in the following columns: Identifier, Name, URI,
      Status, Requester, Revision, Revision Date, Description. In the future,
      a new category of metrics could require additional columns, and adding
      new columns is a recognized form of Registry extension. The
      specification defining the new column(s) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> give general guidelines
      for populating the new column(s) for existing entries.</t>
      <t>The columns of the Performance Metrics Registry are defined below.
      The columns are grouped into "Categories" to facilitate the use of the
      Registry. Categories are described at the "Section 7.x" heading level, and columns
      are described at the "Section 7.x.y" heading level. The figure below illustrates this
      organization. An entry (row) therefore gives a complete description of a
      Registered Performance Metric.</t>
      <t>Each column serves as a checklist item and helps to avoid omissions
      during registration and Expert Review <xref target="RFC8126"/>. </t>

          <t>This column provides a numeric Identifier for the Registered Performance Metric. The Identifier of each Registered Performance Metric <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be unique. Note that revising a Metric according to the process in <xref target="revise-reg-perf-metrics"/> creates a new entry in the Performance Metrics Registry with the same identifier.</t>
          <t>The Registered Performance Metric unique Identifier is an
          unbounded integer (range 0 to infinity).</t>
          <t>The Identifier 0 should be Reserved. The Identifier values from

          <t>If a Performance Metrics Expert providing review determines that

          <t>This column applies to Performance Metrics that generate traffic
          as part of their Measurement Method, including, but not necessarily
          limited to, Active Metrics. The generated traffic is referred to as a
          "stream", and this column describes its characteristics.</t>
          <t>Each entry for this column contains the following information:

            <dt>Reference:</dt><dd>The specification where the Parameters of the
              stream are defined</dd>
      </dl>
          <t>The packet generation stream may require Parameters such as the
          average packet rate and distribution truncation value for streams
          with Poisson-distributed inter-packet sending times. If such
          Parameters are needed, they should be included in either the Fixed
          Parameters column or the Runtime Parameters column, depending on
          whether they will be fixed or will be an input for the metric.</t>
          <t>The simplest example of stream specification is singleton
          scheduling (see <xref target="RFC2330" format="default"/>), where a
          single atomic measurement is conducted. Each atomic measurement
          could consist of sending a single packet (such as a DNS request) or
          sending several packets (for example, to request a web page). Other
          streams support a series of atomic measurements using pairs of
          packets, where the packet stream follows a schedule defining the
          timing between transmitted packets, and an atomic measurement
          assesses the reception time between successive packets (e.g., a
          measurement of Inter-Packet Delay Variation). More complex streams
          and measurement relationships are possible. Principally, two
          different streams are used in IPPM Metrics: (1)&nbsp;Poisson,
          distributed as described in <xref target="RFC2330"
          format="default"/> and (2)&nbsp;periodic, as described in <xref
          target="RFC3432" format="default"/>. Both Poisson and periodic have
          their own unique Parameters, and the relevant set of Parameter names
          and values should be included in either the Fixed Parameters column

          base64-encoded value) or "ip&nbhy;address" as defined in <xref target="RFC6991" format="default"/>.
          The actual encoding(s) used must be explicitly defined for each

          <name>Role</name>
          <t>In some Methods of Measurement, there may be several Roles
          defined, e.g., for a one-way packet delay Active Measurement, there
          is one Measurement Agent that generates the packets and another
          Agent that receives the packets. This column contains the name of
          the Role(s) for this particular entry. In the one-way delay example
          above, there should be two entries in the Registry's Role column, one
          for each Role (Source and Destination). When a Measurement Agent is
          instructed to perform the "Source" Role for the one-way delay metric,
          the Agent knows that it is required to generate packets. The values
          for this field are defined in the Reference Method of Measurement
          (and this frequently results in abbreviated Role names such as

          will identify a method of calibration for the metric, and, when
          available, the measurement system <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> perform the calibration
          when requested and produce the output with an indication that it is
          the result of a calibration method. In-situ calibration could be
          enabled with an internal loopback that includes as much of the
          measurement system as possible, performs address manipulation as
          needed, and provides some form of isolation (e.g., deterministic
          delay) to avoid send-receive interface contention. Some portion of
          the random and systematic error can be characterized in this way.</t>
          <t>For one-way delay measurements, the error calibration must
          include an assessment of the internal clock synchronization with its
          external reference (this internal clock is supplying timestamps for
          measurement). In practice, the time offsets of clocks at both the
          Source and Destination are needed to estimate the systematic error
          due to imperfect clock synchronization (the time offsets are
          smoothed; thus, the random variation is not usually represented in
          the results).</t>
          <t>Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can
          be used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric
          Units. For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal
          the portion of the output result resolution that is the result of
          system noise and is thus inaccurate.</t>

            editorial, or</li>
          <li>it corrects an ambiguity in the Registered Performance Metric's
            definition, which itself leads to issues severe enough to prevent
            the Registered Performance Metric's usage as originally defined,
            or</li>
          <li>it corrects missing information in the metric definition
            without changing its meaning (e.g., the explicit definition of
            'quantity' semantics for numeric fields without a Data Type
            Semantics value), or</li>
          <li>it harmonizes with an external reference that was itself
            corrected, or</li>
          <li>if the current Registry format has been revised by adding a new
          column that is not relevant to an existing Registered Performance
          Metric (i.e., the new column can be safely filled in with “Not
          Applicable”).</li>
          </ol>
        <t>If a Performance Metric revision is deemed permissible and
        backward compatible by the Performance Metrics Experts, according to
        the rules in this document, IANA <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> execute the change(s) in the
        Performance Metrics Registry. The requester of the change is appended
        to the original requester in the Performance Metrics Registry. The
        Name of the revised Registered Performance Metric, including the
        RFCXXXXsecY portion of the Name, <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> remain unchanged even when the
        change is the result of IETF Standards Action. The revised Registry
        Entry <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> reference the new immutable document, such as an RFC. For other standards bodies, it is likely to be necessary to reference
        a specific, dated version of a specification, in an appropriate
        category and column.</t>
        <t>Each Registered Performance Metric in the Performance Metrics
        Registry has a revision number, starting at zero. Each change to a
        Registered Performance Metric following this process increments the
        revision number by one.</t>
        <t>When a revised Registered Performance Metric is accepted into the
        Performance Metrics Registry, the date of acceptance of the most
        recent revision is placed into the Revision Date column of the
        Registry for that Registered Performance Metric.</t>
        <t>Where applicable, additions to Registered Performance Metrics in
        the form of text in the Comments or Remarks column should include the date, but such
        additions may not constitute a revision according to this process.</t>
        <t>Older versions of the updated Metric Entries are kept in the
        Registry for archival purposes. The older entries are kept with all
        fields unmodified (including Revision Date) except for the Status field,
        which <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be changed to 'Deprecated'.</t>
	<t>This process should not in any way be construed as allowing the
   Performance Metrics Experts to overrule IETF consensus.
   Specifically, any Registered Performance Metrics that were added to
   the Performance Metrics Registry with IETF consensus require IETF
   consensus for revision or deprecation.</t>

        <name>Non-Backward-Compatible Deprecation of Registered Performance Metrics</name>
        <t>This section describes how to make a non-backward-compatible update

          <li>the deprecation harmonizes with an external reference that was
            itself deprecated through that reference's accepted deprecation
            method.</li>
        </ol>
        <t>A request for deprecation is sent to IANA, which passes it to the
        Performance Metrics Experts for review. When deprecating a Performance
        Metric, the Performance Metric Description in the Performance Metrics
        Registry <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be updated to explain the deprecation, as well as to
        refer to the new Performance Metric created to replace the deprecated
        Performance Metric.</t>
        <t>When a new, non-backward-compatible Performance Metric replaces a
        (now) deprecated metric, the revision number of the new Registered
        Performance Metric is incremented over the value in the deprecated
        version, and the current date is entered as the Revision Date of the
        new Registered Performance Metric.</t>

        <t>The intentional use of deprecated Registered Performance Metrics
        should result in a log entry or human-readable warning by the
        respective application.</t>
        <t>Names and Metric IDs of deprecated Registered Performance Metrics
        must not be reused.</t>

        <name>Performance Metrics Name Elements</name>
        <t>This memo specifies and populates the Registries for the
        Performance Metric Name Elements.  The Name assigned to a Performance
        Metric Registry Entry consists of multiple Elements separated by an
        "_" (underscore), in the order defined in <xref 
        target="name-sec7-1-2"/>.  IANA has created the following registries,
        which contain the current set of possibilities for each Element in the
        Performance Metric Name.</t>
        <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
          <li>MetricType</li>
          <li>Method</li>
          <li>SubTypeMethod</li>
          <li>Spec</li>
          <li>Units</li>
          <li>Output</li>
        </ul>
        <t>At creation, IANA has populated the Registered Performance Metrics Name Elements 
        using the lists of values for each Name
        Element listed in <xref target="name-sec7-1-2"/>. The Name Elements in each Registry
        are case sensitive.</t>
        <t>When preparing a Metric Entry for registration, the developer
        <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> choose Name Elements from among the registered elements.
        However, if the proposed metric is unique in a significant way, it may
        be necessary to propose a new Name Element to properly describe the
        metric, as described below.</t>

        <t>A candidate Metric Entry proposes a set of values for its Name
        Elements. These are reviewed by IANA and an Expert Reviewer. It is
        possible that a candidate Metric Entry proposes a new value for a Name
        Element (that is, one that is not in the existing list of
        possibilities), or even that it proposes a new Name Element. Such new
        assignments are administered by IANA through the Specification
        Required policy <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/>, which includes Expert Review (i.e., review
        by one of a group of Performance Metrics Experts, who are appointed by
        the IESG upon recommendation of the Transport Area Directors).</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>New Performance Metrics Registry</name>
        <t>This document specifies the Performance Metrics Registry. 
        The Registry contains the following columns in the Summary category:</t>
        <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
          <li>Identifier</li>
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>URI</li>
          <li>Description</li>
          <li>Reference</li>
          <li>Change Controller</li>
          <li>Version</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Descriptions of these columns and additional information
        found in the template for Registry Entries (categories and columns)
        are further defined in <xref target="columns" format="default"/>.</t>

        <t>The Identifier 0 should be Reserved. The Registered Performance
        Metric unique Identifier is an unbounded integer (range 0 to
        infinity). The Identifier values from 64512 to 65535 are reserved for
        private or experimental use, and the user may encounter overlapping
        uses. When adding new Registered Performance Metrics to the
        Performance Metrics Registry, IANA <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> assign the lowest available
        Identifier to the new Registered Performance Metric. If a Performance
        Metrics Expert providing review determines that there is a reason to
        assign a specific numeric Identifier, possibly leaving a temporary gap
        in the numbering, then the Performance Metrics Expert <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> inform IANA of
        this decision.</t>
        <t>Names starting with the prefix "Priv_" are reserved for private use
        and are not considered for registration. The Name column entries are
        further defined in <xref target="columns" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>The URI column will have a URL to each completed
        Registry Entry. The Registry Entry text <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be HTMLized to aid the
        reader (similar to the way that Internet-Drafts are HTMLized, the same tool can perform the function), with links to referenced section(s) of an RFC or another
        immutable document.</t>
        <t>The Reference column will include an RFC number, an approved
        specification designator from another standards body, or some other
        immutable document.</t>

        <t>New assignments for the Performance Metrics Registry will be
   administered by IANA through the Specification Required policy
   <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/> (which includes Expert Review, i.e., review by one of a
   group of experts -- in the case of this document, the Performance
   Metrics Experts, who are appointed by the IESG upon recommendation of
   the Transport Area Directors) or by Standards Action.  The experts can be initially drawn
        from the Working Group Chairs, document editors, and members of the
        Performance Metrics Directorate, among other sources of experts.</t>
        <t>Extensions to the Performance Metrics Registry require IETF
        Standards Action. Only one form of Registry extension is
        envisaged:</t>
        <ul empty="false" spacing="normal">

        </ul>
        <t>If the Performance Metrics Registry is extended in this way,
        the version number of future entries complying with the extension
        <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be incremented (in either the unit or the tenths digit, depending on
