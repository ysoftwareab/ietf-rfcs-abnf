  This document describes OAuth client authentication and certificate-bound
  access and refresh tokens using mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  authentication with X.509 certificates.  OAuth clients are provided a
  mechanism for authentication to the authorization server using mutual TLS,
  based on either self-signed certificates or public key infrastructure (PKI).
  OAuth authorization servers are provided a mechanism for binding access
  tokens to a client's mutual-TLS certificate, and OAuth protected resources
  are provided a method for ensuring that such an access token presented to it
  was issued to the client presenting the token.

  The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework <xref target="RFC6749" format="default"/> enables third-party
  client applications to obtain delegated access to protected resources.
  In the prototypical abstract OAuth flow, illustrated in <xref target="protocol-flow-figure" format="default"/>,
  the client obtains an access token from an entity known as an
  authorization server and then uses that token when accessing protected resources,
  such as HTTPS APIs.

  The flow illustrated in <xref target="protocol-flow-figure" format="default"/> includes the following steps:
      </t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="(%C)" indent="5">
        <li>
      The client makes an HTTPS <tt>POST</tt> request to
      the authorization server and presents
      a credential representing the authorization grant. For
      certain types of clients (those that have been issued or otherwise established
      a set of client credentials) the request must be authenticated.
      In the response, the authorization server issues an access token to the client.
    </li>
        <li>
      The client includes the access token when making a request to access a protected resource.
    </li>
        <li>
      The protected resource validates the access token in order to authorize the request.
      In some cases, such as when the token is self-contained and cryptographically secured,
      the validation can be done locally by the protected resource.  Other cases require
      that the protected resource call out to the authorization server to determine the state
      of the token and obtain metainformation about it.
    </li>
      </ol>
      <t>
  Layering on the abstract flow above, this document standardizes enhanced
  security options for OAuth 2.0 utilizing client-certificate-based mutual
  TLS. <xref target="mtlsca" format="default"/> provides options for
  authenticating the request in Step
  (A). Step (C) is supported with semantics
  to express the binding of the token to the client certificate for both local
  and remote processing in Sections <xref target="x5t" format="counter"/> and
  <xref target="introspect" format="counter"/>, respectively. This ensures
  that, as described in <xref target="CertificateBoundAccessTokens"
  format="default"/>, protected resource access in Step
  (B) is only possible by the legitimate client using a
  certificate-bound token and holding the private key corresponding to the
  certificate.
</t>
      <t>
  OAuth 2.0
  defines a shared-secret method of client authentication but also
  allows for defining and using additional client authentication mechanisms
  when interacting directly with the authorization server.
  This document describes an additional mechanism of client authentication utilizing
  mutual-TLS certificate-based authentication that provides
  better security characteristics than shared secrets.
  While <xref target="RFC6749" format="default"/> documents client authentication for requests to the token endpoint,
  extensions to OAuth 2.0 (such as Introspection <xref target="RFC7662" format="default"></xref>,
  Revocation <xref target="RFC7009" format="default"></xref>, and the Backchannel Authentication Endpoint
  in <xref target="OpenID.CIBA" format="default"/>) define endpoints that also utilize client authentication,
  and the mutual-TLS methods defined herein are applicable to those endpoints as well.
</t>
      <t>
  Mutual-TLS certificate-bound access tokens ensure that
  only the party in possession of the
  private key corresponding to the certificate can utilize the token to
  access the associated resources. Such a constraint is
  sometimes referred to as key confirmation, proof-of-possession, or holder-of-key
  and is unlike the case of the
  bearer token described in <xref target="RFC6750" format="default"/>, where any party in
  possession of the access token can use it to access the associated resources.
  Binding an access token to the client's certificate
  prevents the use of stolen access tokens or replay of access tokens
  by unauthorized parties.
</t>
      <t>
  Mutual-TLS certificate-bound access tokens and mutual-TLS client authentication
  are distinct mechanisms that are complementary but don't necessarily need to be deployed or used together.
</t>
      <t>
  Additional client metadata parameters are introduced by this document in support of
  certificate-bound access tokens and mutual-TLS client authentication.
  The authorization server can obtain client metadata via the
  Dynamic Client Registration Protocol <xref target="RFC7591"
  format="default"></xref>, which defines mechanisms for dynamically registering
  OAuth 2.0 client metadata with authorization servers.
  Also the metadata defined by <xref target="RFC7591" format="default"></xref>, and registered extensions to
  it, imply a general data model for clients that is useful for
  authorization server implementations, even when the Dynamic Client
  Registration Protocol isn't in play. Such implementations will typically have
  some sort of user interface available for managing client configuration.

  Throughout this document the term "mutual TLS" refers to the process whereby, in addition to the normal TLS
  server authentication with a certificate, a client presents its X.509 certificate
  and proves possession of the corresponding private key to a server when negotiating a TLS session.

  In contemporary versions of TLS <xref target="RFC5246" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/>, this requires that the client send
  the Certificate and CertificateVerify messages during the handshake and
  for the server to verify the CertificateVerify and Finished messages.

      <t>
  This section defines, as an extension of 
  <xref target="RFC6749" sectionFormat="of" section="2.3">OAuth 2.0</xref>, two distinct methods of using
  mutual-TLS X.509 client certificates as client credentials.
  The requirement of mutual TLS for client authentication is determined by the authorization server,
  based on policy or configuration for the given client (regardless of whether the client was dynamically
  registered, statically configured, or otherwise established).
</t>
      <t>
  In order to utilize TLS for OAuth client authentication, the TLS
  connection between the client and the authorization server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have been established or re-established
  with mutual-TLS X.509 certificate authentication
  (i.e., the client Certificate and CertificateVerify messages are sent during
  the TLS handshake).



</t>
      <t>
  For all requests to the authorization server utilizing mutual-TLS client
  authentication, the client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the
  <tt>client_id</tt> parameter described in <xref target="RFC6749"
  sectionFormat="of" section="2.2">OAuth 2.0</xref>.  The presence of the
  <tt>client_id</tt> parameter enables the authorization server to easily
  identify the client independently from the content of the certificate. The
  authorization server can locate the client configuration using the client
  identifier and check the certificate presented in the TLS handshake against
  the expected credentials for that client.  The authorization server
  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> enforce the binding between client and certificate, as
  described in either Section <xref target="pki_method" format="counter"/> or <xref
  target="self_signed_method" format="counter"/> below.  If no certificate is
  presented, or that which is presented doesn't match that which is expected
  for the given <tt>client_id</tt>, the authorization server returns a normal
  OAuth 2.0 error response per <xref target="RFC6749" sectionFormat="of"
  section="5.2"></xref> with the <tt>invalid_client</tt> error code to
  indicate failed client authentication.
</t>
      <section anchor="pki_method" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>PKI Mutual-TLS Method</name>
        <t>
        The PKI (public key infrastructure) method of mutual-TLS OAuth client authentication
        adheres to the way in which X.509 certificates are traditionally used
        for authentication. It relies on a validated certificate chain <xref target="RFC5280" format="default"/>
        and a single subject distinguished name (DN) or a single
        subject alternative name (SAN) to authenticate the client.
        Only one subject name value of any type is used for each client.
        The TLS handshake is utilized to validate the client's possession
        of the private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate and to
        validate the corresponding certificate chain. The client is successfully authenticated
        if the subject information in the certificate matches the single expected subject configured or
        registered for that particular client
        (note that a predictable treatment of DN values, such as the distinguishedNameMatch
        rule from <xref target="RFC4517" format="default"/>, is needed in comparing the
        certificate's subject DN to the client's registered DN).
        Revocation checking is possible with the PKI method but if and how to check a certificate's
        revocation status is a deployment decision at the discretion of the authorization server.
        Clients can rotate their X.509 certificates
        without the need to modify the respective authentication data at the authorization
        server by obtaining a new certificate with the same subject from a trusted certificate authority (CA).

        <t>
        This method of mutual-TLS OAuth client authentication
        is intended to support client authentication using self-signed certificates.
        As a prerequisite, the client registers its X.509 certificates
        (using <tt>jwks</tt> defined in <xref target="RFC7591" format="default"/>) or a reference to a trusted source
        for its X.509 certificates (using <tt>jwks_uri</tt> from <xref target="RFC7591" format="default"/>)
        with the authorization server. During authentication,
        TLS is utilized to validate the client's possession of the private key
        corresponding to the public key presented within the certificate in the respective TLS handshake. In
        contrast to the PKI method, the client's certificate chain is not validated by the server in this case.
        The client is successfully authenticated if the
        certificate that it presented during the handshake matches one of the certificates
        configured or registered for that particular client.
        The Self-Signed Certificate method allows the use of mutual TLS to authenticate clients without
        the need to maintain a PKI. When used in conjunction with a <tt>jwks_uri</tt> for the
        client, it also allows the client to rotate its X.509 certificates without the
        need to change its respective authentication data directly with the authorization server.

      <name>Mutual-TLS Client Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</name>
      <t>
  When mutual TLS is used by the client on the connection to the token endpoint,
  the authorization server is able to bind the issued access token to the client certificate.
  Such a binding is accomplished by associating the certificate with the token in
  a way that can be accessed by the protected resource, such as embedding the certificate
  hash in the issued access token directly, using the syntax described in <xref target="x5t" format="default"/>,
  or through token introspection as described in <xref target="introspect" format="default"/>.
  Binding the access token to the client certificate in that fashion has the benefit of
  decoupling that binding from the client's authentication with the
  authorization server, which enables mutual TLS during protected resource access to
  serve purely as a proof-of-possession mechanism.
  Other methods of associating a certificate with an access token are possible,
  per agreement by the authorization server and the protected resource, but are
  beyond the scope of this specification.
</t>
      <t>
  In order for a resource server to use certificate-bound access tokens, it
  must have advance knowledge that mutual TLS is to be used for some or all
  resource accesses.  

   In particular, the access token
   itself cannot be used as input to the decision of whether or not to
   request mutual TLS because (from the TLS perspective) it is
   "Application Data", only exchanged after the TLS handshake has been
   completed, and the initial CertificateRequest occurs during the
   handshake, before the Application Data is available.

   Although subsequent opportunities for a TLS client to
  present a certificate may be available, e.g., via TLS 1.2 renegotiation
  <xref target="RFC5246" format="default"/> or TLS 1.3 post-handshake authentication <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/>, this document
  makes no provision for their usage.  It is expected to be common that a
  mutual-TLS-using resource server will require mutual TLS for all resources hosted
  thereupon or will serve mutual-TLS-protected and regular resources on separate
  hostname and port combinations, though other workflows are possible. 

How
  resource server policy is synchronized with the authorization server (AS) is out of scope for this
  document.
</t>
      <t>
  Within the scope of a mutual-TLS-protected resource-access flow,
  the client makes protected resource requests, as described in <xref target="RFC6750" format="default"/>,
  however, those requests <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be made over a mutually authenticated TLS connection
  using the same certificate that was used for mutual TLS at the token endpoint.
</t>
      <t>
  The protected resource <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> obtain, from its TLS implementation layer, the client certificate
  used for mutual TLS
  and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify that the certificate matches the
  certificate associated with the access token. If they do not match,
  the resource access attempt <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be rejected with an error, per <xref target="RFC6750" format="default"/>,
  using an HTTP 401 status code and the <tt>invalid_token</tt> error code.

        Mutual-TLS OAuth client authentication and certificate-bound access tokens
        can be used independently of each other.
        Use of certificate-bound access tokens without mutual-TLS OAuth client authentication, for example,
        is possible in support of binding access tokens to a TLS client certificate for public clients (those without
        authentication credentials associated with the <tt>client_id</tt>).
        The authorization server would configure the TLS stack in the same manner as for the Self-Signed Certificate method
        such that it does not verify that the certificate presented by the client during the handshake is
        signed by a trusted CA. Individual instances of a client would create a self-signed
        certificate for mutual TLS with both the authorization server and resource server. The authorization
        server would not use the mutual-TLS certificate to authenticate the client at the OAuth layer
        but would bind the issued access token
        to the certificate for which the client has proven possession of the corresponding private key.
        The access token is then bound to the certificate and can only be used by the client
        possessing the certificate and corresponding private key and utilizing them to negotiate mutual TLS on
        connections to the resource server.
        When the authorization server issues a refresh token to such a client, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also bind the refresh token
        to the respective certificate and check the binding when the refresh token is presented to get new
        access tokens.
        The implementation details of the binding of the refresh token are at the discretion of the authorization
        server.

      <t>
        The process of negotiating client certificate-based mutual TLS involves a TLS server requesting a certificate
        from the TLS client (the client does not provide one unsolicited). Although a server can be configured
        such that client certificates are optional, meaning that the connection is allowed to continue when the client
        does not provide a certificate, the act of a server requesting a certificate can result in undesirable
        behavior from some clients. This is particularly true of web browsers as TLS clients, which will typically
        present the end user with an intrusive certificate selection interface when the server requests a certificate.
      </t>

        Authorization servers supporting both clients using mutual TLS and conventional clients <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> chose to
        isolate the server side mutual-TLS behavior to only clients intending to do mutual TLS, thus
        avoiding any undesirable effects it might have on conventional clients. The following authorization server

    it may further isolate any potential impact of the server requesting client certificates by

      OAuth divides the roles and responsibilities such that the resource server relies
      on the authorization server to perform client authentication and obtain resource-owner (end-user)
      authorization. The resource server makes authorization decisions based on the access token
      presented by the client but does not directly authenticate the client per se.
      The manner in which an access token is bound to the client certificate and how a protected resource verifies the proof-of-possession
      decouples that from the specific method that the client used to authenticate with the
      authorization server. Mutual TLS during protected resource access can, therefore,
      serve purely as a proof-of-possession mechanism.
      As such, it is not necessary for the resource server to validate
      the trust chain of the client's certificate in any of the methods
      defined in this document.
      The resource server would, therefore, configure the TLS stack
      in a way that it does not verify whether the certificate presented by the client

        It also implies that access tokens are invalidated when a client updates the certificate,
        which can be handled similarly to expired access tokens where the client

          If, in the future, certificate thumbprints need to be computed using

          TLS certificate validation
          (for both client and server certificates) requires a local database of
          trusted certificate authorities (CAs). Decisions about what CAs to trust
          and how to make such a determination of trust are out of scope for this
          document.

        <name>X.509 Certificate Spoofing</name>
        <t>
          If the PKI method of client authentication is used, an attacker could try to impersonate a client using
          a certificate with the same subject (DN or SAN) but issued by a
	  different CA that the authorization server trusts.
          To cope with that threat, the authorization server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> only accept, as trust anchors,
          a limited number of CAs whose certificate issuance policy meets its security requirements.
          There is an assumption then that the client and server agree out of band on the set
          of trust anchors that the server uses to create and validate the
          certificate chain. Without this assumption the use of a subject
          to identify the client certificate would open the server up to
          certificate spoofing attacks.

        <name>X.509 Certificate Parsing and Validation Complexity</name>
        <t>
          Parsing and validation of X.509 certificates and certificate chains
	  is complex, and implementation
          mistakes have previously exposed security vulnerabilities.
          Complexities of validation include (but are not limited to)
          <xref target="CX5P" format="default"/> <xref target="DCW" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC5280" format="default"/>:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>checking of basic constraints, basic and extended key usage constraints, validity periods, and critical extensions;</li>
          <li>handling of embedded NUL bytes in ASN.1 counted-length strings and non-canonical or non-normalized string representations in subject names;</li>
          <li>handling of wildcard patterns in subject names;</li>
          <li>recursive verification of certificate chains and checking certificate revocation.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          For these reasons, implementors <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use an established and well-tested X.509 library
          (such as one used by an established TLS library) for validation of X.509 certificate chains
          and <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> attempt to write their own X.509 certificate validation procedures.

      <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
      <t>
        In TLS versions prior to 1.3, the client's certificate is sent unencrypted in the initial handshake and
        can potentially be used by third parties to monitor, track, and correlate client activity.
        This is likely of little concern for clients that act on behalf of a
	significant number of end users because
        individual user activity will not be discernible amidst the client activity as a whole.
        However, clients that act on behalf of a single end user, such as a native application on a mobile device,
        should use TLS version 1.3 whenever possible or consider the potential privacy implications of using mutual TLS on
        earlier versions.

          "Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)" <xref target="RFC7800" format="default"></xref> defined the
          <tt>cnf</tt> (confirmation) claim that enables
          confirmation key information to be carried in a JWT.
          However, the same proof-of-possession semantics are also useful for introspected access tokens
          whereby the protected resource obtains the confirmation key data as metainformation
          of a token introspection response and uses that information in verifying proof-of-possession.

          OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection <xref target="RFC7662" format="default"></xref> using the <tt>cnf</tt>
          structure.

          has the same semantics and format as the claim of the same name defined in <xref target="RFC7800" format="default"/>.
          While this specification only explicitly uses the <tt>x5t#S256</tt>
          confirmation method member (see <xref target="introspect" format="default"/>), it needs to define and register

      <name>Relationship to Token Binding</name>
      <t>
        OAuth 2.0 Token Binding <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-token-binding" format="default"></xref>
        enables the application of Token Binding to the various artifacts and tokens employed throughout OAuth.
        That includes binding of an access token to a Token Binding key, which bears some similarities in motivation
        and design to the mutual-TLS client certificate-bound access tokens defined in this document.
        Both documents define what is often called a proof-of-possession security mechanism
        for access tokens, whereby a client must demonstrate possession of cryptographic keying
        material when accessing a protected resource. The details differ somewhat between the two documents but both
        have the authorization server bind the access token that it issues to an asymmetric key pair
        held by the client. The client then proves possession of the private key from that pair
        with respect to the TLS connection over which the protected resource is accessed.
      </t>
      <t>
        Token Binding uses bare keys that are generated on the client,
        which avoids many of the difficulties of creating, distributing, and managing certificates
        used in this specification. However, at the time of
        writing, Token Binding is fairly new, and there is relatively little support for it in available
        application development platforms and tooling. Until better support for the underlying
        core Token Binding specifications exists, practical implementations of OAuth 2.0 Token Binding
        are infeasible. 
        Mutual TLS, on the other hand, has been around for some time and enjoys
        widespread support in web servers and development platforms. As a consequence, OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS
        Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens can be
        built and deployed now using existing platforms and tools.
        In the future, the two specifications are likely to be
        deployed in parallel for solving similar problems in different environments.
        Authorization servers may even support both specifications simultaneously using different
        proof-of-possession mechanisms for tokens issued to different clients.

        Scott "not Tomlinson" Tomilson and <contact fullname="Matt Peterson"/> were involved in
        design and development work on a mutual-TLS OAuth client authentication
        implementation that predates this document. Experience and learning from that work
        informed some of the content of this document.
