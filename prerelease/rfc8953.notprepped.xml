      <t>The Coordinating Attack Response at Internet Scale (CARIS) 2
      workshop <xref target="CARISEvent"></xref>, sponsored by the
      Internet Society, took place on 28 February and 1 
      March 2019 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Participants spanned
      regional, national, international, and enterprise Computer Security
      Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), operators, 
      service providers, network and security operators, transport operators
      and researchers, incident response researchers, vendors, and
      participants from standards communities. This workshop continued the
      work started at the first CARIS workshop <xref
      target="RFC8073"></xref>, with a focus on scaling 
      incident prevention and detection as the Internet industry moves to
      a stronger and a more ubiquitous deployment of session encryption.

      Considering the related initiative to form a research group (Stopping
      Malware and Researching Threats <xref target="SMART"></xref>) in the
      Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), the focus on prevention included
      consideration of research opportunities to improve protocols and
      determine if there are ways to improve attack detection during
      the protocol design phase that could later influence protocol
      development in the IETF. This is one way to think about scaling
      response, through prevention and allowing for new methods to evolve for
      detection in a post-encrypted world.

Although the proposed SMART Research Group has not yet progressed, the work to better
scale incident response continues through the projects proposed at CARIS2 as
well as in future CARIS workshops.</t>

    <section>
      <name>CARIS2 Goals</name>
      <t>The goal of each CARIS workshop has been to focus on the challenge of
 improving the overall security posture.  The approach has been to
 identify intrinsic or built-in protection capabilities for improved defense,
 automation, and scaling attack response through collaboration and
 improved architectural patterns.  

It has been assumed that additional training will likely not address the lack
of information security professionals to fill the job gap.  Currently, there
is approximately a <xref target="deficit">three-million-person deficit</xref>
for security professionals worldwide, and that is only expected to grow. In
preparing for the workshop, the chair and program committee considered that
this gap cannot be filled through training but requires measures to reduce the
number of information security professionals needed through new architectures
and research toward attack prevention. CARIS2 was specifically focused on the
industry shift toward the increased use of stronger session encryption (<xref
target="RFC8446">TLS&nbsp;1.3</xref>, <xref
target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport">QUIC</xref>, <xref
target="RFC8548">tcpcrypt</xref>, etc.) and how prevention and detection can
advance in this new paradigm. As such, the goals for this workshop
included:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li><t>Scale attack response, including ways to improve prevention, as
          the Internet shifts to use of stronger and more ubiquitous
          encryption.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>Determine research opportunities</li>

            <li>Consider methods to improve protocols and provide guidance
            toward goal. For instance, are there ways to build detection of
            threats into protocols, since they cannot be monitored on the wire
            in the future?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Identify promising research ideas to seed a research agenda to
          input to the proposed IRTF SMART Research Group.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <name>Workshop Collaboration</name>
      <t>Both CARIS workshops brought together a set of individuals who had
   not previously collaborated toward the goals of scaling attack
   response. 

 This is important as the participants span various areas of Internet
 technology work, conduct research, provide a global perspective, have access
 to varying data sets and infrastructure, and are influential in their area of
 expertise.

The specific goals, contributions, and participants of the CARIS2 workshop
were all considered in the design of the breakout sessions to both identify
and advance research through collaboration.

The breakout sessions varied in format to keep attendees engaged and
collaborating; some involved the full set of attendees while others utilized
groups.

        <name>Breakout 1 Results: Standardization and Adoption</name>
        <t>This breakout session considered points raised in the preceding
        talks on hurdles for automating security controls, detection, and
        response; the teams presenting noted several challenges they still
        face today. The breakout session worked toward identifying standard protocols
        and data formats that succeeded in achieving adoption as well as
        several that failed or only achieved limited adoption. The results
        from the evaluation were interesting and could aid in achieving
        greater adoption when new work areas are developed.  The following
	subsections detail the results.
        </t>
        <section>

        <name>Wide Adoption</name>
        <t>
   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol has replaced the Secure Sockets
   Layer (SSL) protocol.</t>
        <t>Observations: There was a clear need for session encryption at the
        transport layer to protect application data. E-commerce was a driving
        force at the time with a downside to those who did not adopt. Other
        positive attributes that aided adoption were modular design, clean
        interfaces, and being first to market.</t>
        
        <t>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) enables configuration
        management of devices with extension points for private configuration
        and management settings. SNMP is widely adopted and is only now, after
        decades, being replaced by a newer alternative, YANG (a data modeling
	language) that facilitates configuration management via the Network
	Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) or RESTCONF. SNMP facilitated an
        answer to a needed problem set: configuration, telemetry, and network
        management. Its development considered the connection between the
        user, vendor, and developers. Challenges did surface for adoption from
        SNMPv1.1 to 1.2, as there was no compelling reason for adoption. SNMPv3
        gained adoption due to its resilience to attacks by providing
        protection through improved authentication and encryption.</t>
        
        <t>IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) was identified as achieving wide
        adoption for several reasons. The low cost of entry, wide vendor
        support, diverse user base, and wide set of use cases spanning
        multiple technology areas were some of the key drivers cited.</t>
        <t>X.509 was explored for its success in gaining adoption. The
        solution being abstract from crypto, open, customizable, and
        extensible were some of the reasons cited for its successful adoption.
        The team deemed it a good solution to a good problem and observed that
        government adoption aided its success.</t>
        </section>

        <section>
        <name>Limited Adoption</name>
        <t>Next, each team evaluated solutions that have not enjoyed wide
        adoption.</t>
        <t>Although Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) and
	the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) are somewhat similar in their goals, the
        standards were selected for evaluation by two separate groups with
        some common findings.</t>
        <t>STIX
	has had limited adoption by the financial sector but no 
        single, definitive end user. The standard is still in development with
        the US government as the primary developer in partnership with OASIS.
        There is interest in using STIX to manage content, but users don't
        really care about what technology is used for the exchange. The
        initial goals may not wind up matching the end result for STIX, as
        managing content may be the primary use case.</t>

       
        <t>IODEF was specified
        by National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) and Computer
	Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and formalized in the
	IETF <xref target="RFC7970"/>. The user is the 
        security operations center (SOC). While there are several
        implementations, it is not widely adopted. In terms of exchange, users
        are more interested in indicators than full event information, and this
        applies to STIX as well. Sharing and trust are additional hurdles as
        many are not willing to disclose information.</t>
        
        <t>DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) has DNSSEC as a
        dependency, which is a hurdle toward adoption (too many
        dependencies). It has a roll-your-own adoption model, which is risky.
        While there are some large pockets of adoption, there is still much
        work to do to gain widespread adoption. A regulatory requirement gave
        rise to partial adoption in Germany, which naturally resulted in
        production of documentation written in German -- possibly giving rise
        to further adoption in German-speaking countries. There has also been
        progress made in the Netherlands through the creation of a website:
        <eref target="internet.nl" brackets="angle"/>. The website allows you to test your website for a
        number of standards (IPv6, DNSSEC, DANE, etc.). <eref
	target="internet.nl" brackets="angle"/> is a
        collaboration of industry organizations, companies, and the government
        in the Netherlands and is available for worldwide use.</t>
        
        <t>IP version 6 (IPv6) has struggled, and the expense of running a dual
        stack was one of the highest concerns on the list discussed in the
	workshop breakout. The end user for IPv6 is 
        everyone, and the breakout team considered it too ambiguous. Too many new requirements have been added
        over its 20-year life. The scope of necessary adoption is large with
        many peripheral devices. Government requirements for support have
        helped somewhat with improved interoperability and adoption, but
        features like NAT being added to IPv4 slowed adoption. With no new
        features being added to IPv4 and lessons learned, there's still a
        possibility for success.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <name>Breakout 2 Results: Preventative Protocols and Scaling Defense</name>
        <t>This breakout session followed the sessions on MUD, Protocol for
        Automated Vulnerability Assessment (PAVA), and Protocol for Automatic
        Security Configuration (PASC), which have themes of automation at scale. MUD
        was designed for Internet of Things (IoT), and as such, scaling was a major consideration.
        The PAVA and PASC work builds off of MUD and maintains some of the
        same themes. This breakout session was focused on groups brainstorming
        preventative measures and enabling vendors to deploy mitigations.</t>
        
        <t>One group dove a bit deeper into MUD and layer 2 (L2) discovery.
        MUD changes sets of filtering control
        management to the vendor or intermediary MUD vendors for a predictable
        platform that scales well.  While the overall value of MUD is clear, the
        use of MUD and what traffic is expected for a particular device should be considered
        sensitive information, as it could be used to exploit a device. MUD has
        an option of using L2 discovery to share MUD files. L2 discovery, like
        the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), is not encrypted from
        the local client to the DHCP server at this point in time (there is
        some interest to correct this, but it hasn't received enough support
        yet). As a result, it is possible to leak information and reveal data
        about the devices for which the MUD files would be applied. This could
        multicast out information such as network characteristics, firmware
        versions, manufacturers, etc. 



There was some discussion on the use of 802.11 to improve connections <xref
target="IEEE802.11"/>. Several participants from this group plan to research
this further and identify options to prevent information leakage while
achieving the stated goals of MUD.</t>
        
        <t>The next group discussed a proposal one of the participants had
        already begun developing, namely privacy for rendezvous service. The
        basic idea was to encrypt Server Name Indication (SNI) using DNS to obtain public keys. The
        suffix on server IPv6 would be unique to a TLS session (information
        missing). The discussion on this proposal was fruitful, as the full set
        of attendees engaged, with special interest from the incident
        responders to be involved in early review cycles. Incident responders
        are very interested to understand how protocols will change and to
        assess the overall impact of changes on privacy and security
        operations. Even if there are no changes to the protocol proposals
        stemming from this review, the group discussion landed on this being a
        valuable exchange to understand early the impacts of changes for
        incident detection and mitigation, to devise new strategies, and to
        provide assessments on the impact of protocol changes on security in
        the round.</t>

<t>
 The third group reported back on trust exchanges relying heavily on
 relationships between individuals.  They were concerned with scaling the
 trust model and finding ways to do that better.  The group dove deeper into
 this topic.

</t>
        
        <t>The fourth group discussed useful data for incident
        responders. This built on the first breakout session (<xref target="breakout_1"/>). The group
        determined that indicators of compromise (IoCs) are what most
        organizations and groups are able to successfully exchange. Ideally,
        these would be fixed and programmable. They discussed developing a
        richer format for sharing event threats. When reporting back to the group,
        a successful solution used in the EU was mentioned: the <xref
	target="MISP">Malware
	Information Sharing Platform (MISP)</xref>. This 
        will be considered in the review of existing efforts to determine if
        anything new is needed.</t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Breakout 3 Results: Incident Response Coordination</name>
        <t>Incident response coordination currently does not scale. This
        breakout session focused on brainstorming incident response and
        coordination, looking specifically at what works well for teams today,
        what is holding them back, and what risks loom ahead. Output from this
        session could be used to generate research and to dive deeper in a
        dedicated workshop on these topics.</t>

        <name>Breakout 4 Results: Monitoring and Measurement</name>
        
        <t>The fourth breakout session followed <contact fullname="Dave Plonka"/>'s talk on IPv6 aggregation
        to provide privacy for IPv6 sessions. Essentially, IPv6 provides
        additional capabilities for monitoring sessions end to end. Dave and
        his coauthor, <contact fullname="Arthur Berger"/>, primarily focus on measurement research
        but found a way to aggregate sessions to assist with maintaining user
        privacy. If you can devise methods to perform management and
        measurement, or even perform security functions, while accommodating
        methods to protect privacy, a stronger result is likely. This also
        precludes the need for additional privacy improvement work to defeat
        measurement objectives.</t>
        <t>This breakout session was focused on devising methods to perform monitoring
        and measurement, coupled with advancing privacy considerations. The
        full group listed out options for protocols to explore and ranked
        them, with the four highest then explored by the breakout groups. Groups
        agreed to work further on the proposed ideas.</t>

        <section>
        <name>IP Address Reputation</name>

        <t>There is a need to understand address assignment and configuration
        for hosts and services, especially with IPv6 <xref
	target="PlonkaBergerCARIS2"/> in (1) sharing IP-address-related 
        information to inform attack response efforts while still protecting
        the privacy of victims and possible attackers and (2) mitigating
        abuse by altering the treatment, e.g., dropping or rate-limiting, of
        packets. Currently, there is no database that analysts and researchers
        can consult to, for instance, determine the lifetimes of IPv6 addresses
        or the prefix length at which the address is expected to be stable
        over time. The researchers propose either introducing a new database (compare
        PeeringDB) or extending existing databases (e.g., the regional
	Internet registries (RIRs)) to
        contain such information and allowing arbitrary queries. The prefix
        information would either be provided by networks that are willing or
        based on measurement algorithms that reverse-engineer reasonable
        values based on Internet measurements <xref
	target="PlonkaBergerKIP"/>. 


In the former case, the incentive of networks to provide such information is
to ensure that privacy of their users is respected and to limit collateral
damage caused by access control lists affecting more of that network's
addresses than necessary, e.g., in the face of abuse.

        <name>Server Name Authentication Reputation C (SNARC)</name>
        <t>SNARC is a mechanism to
	assign value to trust indicators, used to
        make decisions about good or bad actors. 


The mechanism would be able to distinguish between client and server
connections and would be human readable. In addition, it builds on zero trust
networking and avoids consolidation, thus supporting legitimate new players.



SNARC has a similar theme to the IP reputation/BGP ranking idea mentioned
above.

SNARC is not currently defined by an RFC; however, such an RFC would help
customers and design teams on existing solutions.

The group plans to research visual aspects and underlying principles as they
begin work on this idea.  They plan to begin work in several stages,
researching "trust" indicators, "trust" value calculations, and research
actions to apply to "trust".

The overarching goal is to address blind trust, one of the challenges
identified with information/incident exchanges. <contact fullname="Trent

        <name>Logging</name>
        <t>The group presented the possibility of injecting logging
        capabilities at compile time for applications, resulting in a more
        consistent set of logs, covering an agreed set of conditions. Using
        a log-injecting compiler would increase logging for those
        applications and improve the uniformity of logged activity. Increasing
        logging capabilities at the endpoint is necessary as the shift toward
        increased use of encrypted transport continues. <contact fullname="Nalini

        <t>Fingerprinting has been used for numerous applications on the Web,
        including security, and will become of increasing importance with the
        deployment of stronger encryption. Fingerprinting provides a method to
        identify traffic without using decryption. The group discussed privacy
        considerations and balancing how you achieve the security benefits
        (identifying malicious traffic, information leakage, threat
        indicators, etc.). They are interested in deriving methods to validate
        the authenticity without identifying the source of traffic. They are
        also concerned with scaling issues. <contact fullname="William

        <name>Taxonomy and Gaps Session</name>
        <t>At the start of the second day of the workshop, <contact
        fullname="Kirsty Paine"/> and <contact fullname="Mirjam KÃ¼hne"/>
        prepared (and Kirsty led) a workshop-style session to discuss
        taxonomies used in incident response, attacks, and threat detection,
        comparing solutions and identifying gaps. 

  The primary objective was to determine a path forward by selecting the
  language to be used in the proposed SMART Research Group.


 Several taxonomies were presented for review and discussion. The topic
 remains open, but the following key points were highlighted by
 participants:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>A single taxonomy might not be the way to go, because which
            taxonomy you use depends on what problem you are trying to solve,
            e.g., attribution of the attack, mitigation steps, technical
            features, or organizational impact measurements.</li>
          <li>A tool to map between taxonomies should be automated, as there
            are requirements within groups or nations to use specific
            taxonomies.</li>
          <li>The level of detail needed for reporting to management and for
            the analyst investigating the incident can be very different. At
            the workshop, one attendee mentioned that, for management reporting,
            they only use 8 categories to lighten the load on analysts,
            whereas some of the taxonomies contain 52 categories.</li>
          <li>How you plan to use the taxonomy matters and may vary between
            use cases. Take, for instance, sharing data with external entities
            versus internal only. The taxonomy selected depends on what you
            plan to do with it. Some stated a need for attribute-based dynamic
            anthologies as opposed to rigid taxonomies used by others. A rigid
            taxonomy did not work for many from feedback in the session.</li>
          <li><xref target="RFC4949"></xref> was briefly discussed as a possibility; however, there
            is a clear need to update terminology in this publication around
            this space in particular. This is likely to be raised in the Security
	    Area Advisory Group (SAAG) during the open mic session,
            hopefully with proposed new definitions to demonstrate the issue
            and evolution of terms over time.</li>

<li>
  Within a taxonomy, prioritization matters to understand the impact of
  threats or an attack.  How do you map that between differing taxonomies?
  What is the problem to be solved, and what tooling is required?

</li>

      <li>Attack attribution had varying degrees of interest. 


Some felt the public sector cared more about attribution, not about
individuals.  They were interested in possible motivations behind an attack
and determining if there were other likely victims based on these motivations.

Understanding if the source was an individual actor, organized crime, or a
nation state mattered.
	  </li>

        </ul>
        <t>The result of this discussion was not to narrow down to one
        taxonomy but to think about mappings between taxonomies and the use
        cases for exchanging or sharing information, eventually giving rise to
        a common method to discuss threats and attacks. Researchers need a
        common vocabulary, not necessarily a common taxonomy.</t>

    <section>
      <name>Next Steps</name>
      <t>The next steps from the CARIS2 workshop are twofold:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
      <li>The research
      initiatives spawned from the second CARIS workshop require further exploration
      and development. Fostering this development and creating communities
      around each proposed project is the first step, with reports back out to
      the SMART mailing list.</li>
      <li>The second initiative will be planning for the next CARIS workshop.
      </li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <name>Summary</name>
      <t>When wrapping up the workshop, we reviewed the list of agreed projects to
      get a feel for actual interest as a follow up. Through the course of the
      two-day workshop, a larger set of potential research items had
      been generated, and this gave participants a chance to reassess commitments to
      better have them match expected outcomes. The highest ranking projects in
      terms of interest to drive the ideas forward included the following:</t>

      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Traffic fingerprinting</li>
        <li>SNARC</li>
        <li>Attack coordination solutions and automated security</li>
        <li>Cryptographic rendezvous</li>
        <li>L2 discovery</li>
      </ul>

      workshop summary report.</t>
