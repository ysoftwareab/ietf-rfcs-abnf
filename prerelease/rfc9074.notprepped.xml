      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The <xref target="RFC5545" format="default">iCalendar specification</xref>
      defines a set of components used to describe calendar data. One
      of those is the "VALARM" component, which appears as a
      subcomponent of the "VEVENT" and "VTODO" components. The "VALARM"
      component is used to specify a reminder for an event or
      task. Different alarm actions are possible, as are different
      ways to specify how the alarm is triggered.</t>
      <t>As iCalendar has become more widely used and as client-server
      protocols, such as <xref target="RFC4791" format="default">Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV
      (CalDAV)</xref>, have
      become more prevalent, several issues with "VALARM" components
      have arisen. Most of these relate to the need to extend the
      existing "VALARM" component with new properties and behaviors to
      allow clients and servers to accomplish specific tasks in an
      interoperable manner. For example, clients typically need a way
      to specify that an alarm has been dismissed by a calendar user
      or has been "snoozed" by a set amount of time. To date, this has
      been done through the use of custom "X-" properties specific to
      each client implementation, leading to poor
      interoperability.</t>
      <t>This specification defines a set of extensions to "VALARM"
      components to cover common requirements for alarms not currently
      addressed in iCalendar. Each extension is defined in a separate
      section below. For the most part, each extension can be
      supported independently of the others; though, in some cases, one
      extension will require another. In addition, this specification
      describes mechanisms by which clients can interoperably
      implement common features, such as "snoozing".</t>

      <name>Extensible Syntax for VALARM</name>
      <t><xref target="RFC5545" sectionFormat="of" section="3.6.6"/> defines the syntax
      for "VALARM" components and properties within them. However, as
      written, it is hard to extend this, e.g., by adding a new
      property common to all types of alarms. Since many of the
      extensions defined in this document need to extend the base
      syntax, an alternative form for the base syntax is defined here,
      with the goal of simplifying specification of the extensions
      while augmenting the existing functionality defined in
      <xref target="RFC5545" format="default"/> to allow for nested subcomponents
      (as required by

      to enable its use with "VALARM" components. Specific types of
      relationships between "VALARM" components can be identified by

      <name>Alarm Acknowledgement</name>
      <t>There is currently no way for a "VALARM" component to
      indicate whether it has been triggered and acknowledged. With
      the advent of a standard client/server protocol for calendaring
      and scheduling data (<xref target="RFC4791" format="default"/>), it is quite
      possible for an event with an alarm to exist on multiple clients
      in addition to the server. If each of those is responsible for
      performing the action when an alarm triggers, then multiple
      "alerts" are generated by different devices. In such a
      situation, a calendar user would like to be able to "dismiss"
      the alarm on one device and have it automatically dismissed on
      the others, too.</t>
      <t>Also, with recurring events that have alarms, it is important
      to know when the last alarm in the recurring set was
      acknowledged so that the client can determine whether past
      alarms have been missed.</t>
      <t>To address these needs, this specification adds an
      "ACKNOWLEDGED" property to "VALARM" components to indicate when
      the alarm was last acknowledged (or sent, if acknowledgement is
      not possible).
      This is defined by the
      syntax below.

          <dt>Description:</dt>
          <dd><t>This property is used to
            specify when an alarm was last sent or acknowledged. This
            allows clients to determine when a pending alarm has been
            acknowledged by a calendar user so that any alerts can be
            dismissed across multiple devices. It also allows clients
            to track repeating alarms or alarms on recurring events or
            to-dos to ensure that the right number of missed alarms
            can be tracked.</t>
            <t>Clients <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> set this property to the current
            date-time value in UTC when a calendar user acknowledges a
            pending alarm.
            Certain kinds of alarms, such as email-based alerts, might
            not provide feedback as to when the calendar user sees them.
            For those kinds of alarms, the
            client <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> set this property when the alarm is
            triggered and the action is successfully carried out.
            </t>
            <t>When an alarm is triggered on a
            client, clients can check to see if an "ACKNOWLEDGED"
            property is present. If it is, and the value of that
            property is greater than or equal to the computed trigger
            time for the alarm, then the client <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> trigger the
            alarm. Similarly, if an alarm has been triggered and an
            "alert" has been presented to a calendar user, clients can monitor
            the iCalendar data to determine whether an "ACKNOWLEDGED" property
            is added or changed in the alarm component. If the value
            of any "ACKNOWLEDGED" property in the alarm changes and is greater
            than or equal to the trigger time of the alarm, then
            clients <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> dismiss or cancel any "alert" presented to
            the calendar user.</t>

      <t>Currently, a "VALARM" is triggered when a specific date-time value is
      reached. It is also desirable to be able to trigger alarms based
      on location, e.g., when arriving at or departing from a
      particular location.</t>
      <t>This specification adds the following elements to "VALARM"
      components to indicate when an alarm can be triggered based on
      location.

      <t>
        Typically, when a "PROXIMITY" property is used, there is no
        need to specify a time-based trigger using the "TRIGGER"
        property. However, since "TRIGGER" is defined as a required
        property for a "VALARM" component, for backwards compatibility,
        it has to be present but ignored. To indicate a "TRIGGER"
        that is to be ignored, clients <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use a value a long time
        in the past. A value of "19760401T005545Z" has been commonly
        used for this purpose.

      <t>In addition to the security properties of iCalendar
      (see <xref target="RFC5545" sectionFormat="of" section="7"/>),
      a "VALARM", if not monitored properly, can be used to disturb
      users and/or leak personal information.  For instance, an
      undesirable audio alert could cause embarrassment; an
      unwanted display alert could be considered an annoyance; or an
      email alert could be used to leak a user's location to a third
      party or to send unsolicited email to multiple users.
      Therefore, CalDAV clients and servers that accept iCalendar data
      from a third party (e.g., via iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) <xref target="RFC5546" format="default"/>,
      a subscription feed, or a shared calendar) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> remove each
      "VALARM" from the data prior to storing in their calendar system.</t>
      <t>Security considerations related to unique identifiers for "VALARM"
      are discussed in <xref target="uid" format="default"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
      <t>A proximity "VALARM", if not used carefully, can leak a
      user's past, present, or future location.  For instance,
      storing an iCalendar resource containing proximity "VALARM"s to a
      shared calendar on CalDAV server can expose to anyone that has
      access to that calendar the user's intent to leave
      from or arrive at a particular location at some future time.
      Furthermore, if a CalDAV client updates the shared iCalendar
      resource with an "ACKNOWLEDGED" property when the alarm is
      triggered, this will leak the exact date and time that the user left
      from or arrived at the location.
      
      Therefore, CalDAV clients that implement proximity alarms
      <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> give users the option of storing and/or acknowledging the
      alarms on the local device only and not storing the alarm and/or
      acknowledgement on a remote server.</t>
