    <abstract>
      <t>Data centers are attached to the Internet or a backbone network by
      gateway routers.  One data center typically has more than one gateway
      for commercial, load-balancing, and resiliency reasons.  Other sites,
      such as access networks, also need to be connected across backbone
      networks through gateways.</t>
      <t>This document defines a mechanism using the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation
      attribute to allow data center gateway routers to advertise routes to
      the prefixes reachable in the site, including advertising them on behalf
      of other gateways at the same site.  This allows segment routing to be
      used to identify multiple paths across the Internet or backbone network
      between different gateways.  The paths can be selected for
      load-balancing, resilience, and quality purposes.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>

      <t>Data centers (DCs) are critical components of the infrastructure used
      by network operators to provide services to their customers.  DCs
      (sites) are interconnected by a backbone network, which consists of any
      number of private networks and/or the Internet.  DCs are attached to the
      backbone network by routers that are gateways (GWs).  One DC typically has more
      than one GW for various reasons including commercial preferences, load
      balancing, or resiliency against connection or device failure.</t>
      <t>Segment Routing (SR) (<xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/>) is a
      protocol mechanism that can be used within a DC as well as for steering
      traffic that flows between two DC sites.  In order for a source site
      (also known as an ingress site) that uses SR to load-balance the flows
      it sends to a destination site (also known as an egress site), it needs
      to know the complete set of entry nodes (i.e., GWs) for that egress DC
      from the backbone network connecting the two DCs.  Note that it is
      assumed that the connected set of DC sites and the border nodes in the
      backbone network on the paths that connect the DC sites are part of the
      same SR BGP - Link State (LS) instance (see <xref target="RFC7752"
      format="default"/> and <xref
      target="RFC9086" format="default"/>) so
      that traffic engineering using SR may be used for these flows.</t>


      <t>Other sites, such as access networks, also need to be connected
      across backbone networks through gateways.  For illustrative purposes,
      consider the ingress and egress sites shown in <xref
      target="david_hockney" format="default"/> as separate Autonomous Systems (ASes) (noting that
      the sites could be implemented as part of the ASes to which they are
      attached, or as separate ASes).  

      The various ASes that provide connectivity between the ingress and
      egress sites could each be constructed differently and use different
      technologies such as IP; MPLS using global table routing information
      from BGP; MPLS IP VPN; SR-MPLS IP VPN; or SRv6 IP VPN.

      That is, the ingress and egress sites can be connected by tunnels across
      a variety of technologies. This document describes how SR Segment
      Identifiers (SIDs) are used to identify the paths between the ingress
      and egress sites.</t>

      <t>The solution described in this document is agnostic as to whether the
      transit ASes do or do not have SR capabilities.  The solution uses SR to
      stitch together path segments between GWs and through the Autonomous
      System Border Routers (ASBRs).  Thus, there is a requirement that the
      GWs and ASBRs are SR capable.  The solution supports the SR path being
      extended into the ingress and egress sites if they are SR capable.</t>
      <t>The solution defined in this document can be seen in the broader
      context of site interconnection in <xref
      target="I-D.farrel-spring-sr-domain-interconnect" format="default"/>.
      That document shows how other existing protocol elements may be combined
      with the solution defined in this document to provide a full system, but
      it is not a necessary reference for understanding this document.</t>
      
      <t>Suppose that there are two gateways, GW1 and GW2 as shown in <xref
      target="david_hockney" format="default"/>, for a given egress site and
      that they each advertise a route to prefix X, which is located within the
      egress site with each setting itself as next hop.  One might think that
      the GWs for X could be inferred from the routes' next-hop fields, but
      typically it is not the case that both routes get distributed across the
      backbone: rather only the best route, as selected by BGP, is
      distributed.  This precludes load-balancing flows across both GWs.</t>

      <t>The obvious solution to this problem is to use the BGP feature that
      allows the advertisement of multiple paths in BGP (known as Add-Paths)
      (<xref target="RFC7911" format="default"/>) to ensure that all routes to X
      get advertised by BGP.  However, even if this is done, the identity of
      the GWs will be lost as soon as the routes get distributed through an
      ASBR that will set itself to be the
      next hop.  And if there are multiple ASes in the
      backbone, not only will the next hop change several times, but the
      Add-Paths technique will experience scaling issues.  This all means that
      the Add-Paths approach is effectively limited to sites connected over a
      single AS.</t>
      <t>This document defines a solution that overcomes this limitation and
      works equally well with a backbone constructed from one or more ASes
      using the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute (<xref target="RFC9012"
      format="default"/>) as follows:
      </t>
      <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
        <li>When a GW to a given site advertises a route to a prefix X within
        that site, it will include a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute that
        contains the union of the Tunnel Encapsulation attributes advertised
        by each of the GWs to that site, including itself.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>In other words, each route advertised by a GW identifies all of the
      GWs to the same site (see <xref target="DCGWautodisco"
      format="default"/> for a discussion of how GWs discover each other),
      i.e., the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute advertised by each GW contains
      multiple Tunnel TLVs, one or more from each active GW, and each Tunnel
      TLV will contain a Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV that identifies the GW
      for that Tunnel TLV.  Therefore, even if only one of the routes is
      distributed to other ASes, it will not matter how many times the next
      hop changes, as the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute will remain
      unchanged.</t>
      <t>To put this in the context of <xref target="david_hockney"
      format="default"/>, GW1 and GW2 discover each other as gateways for the
      egress site.  Both GW1 and GW2 advertise themselves as having routes to
      prefix X.  Furthermore, GW1 includes a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute,
      which is the union of its Tunnel Encapsulation attribute and GW2's
      Tunnel Encapsulation attribute.  Similarly, GW2 includes a Tunnel
      Encapsulation attribute, which is the union of its Tunnel Encapsulation
      attribute and GW1's Tunnel Encapsulation attribute.  The gateway in the
      ingress site can now see all possible paths to X in the egress site
      regardless of which route is propagated to it, and it can choose one or
      balance traffic flows as it sees fit.</t>

      <name>Site Gateway Auto-Discovery</name>
      <t>To allow a given site's GWs to auto-discover each other and to coordinate their operations,
        the following procedures are implemented:

      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>A route target (<xref target="RFC4360" format="default"/>) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
        attached to each GW's auto-discovery route (defined below), and its
        value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to a value that indicates the site identifier.  The
        rules for constructing a route target are detailed in <xref
        target="RFC4360" format="default"/>.  It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that a Type
        x00 or x02 route target be used.</li>
        <li>Site identifiers are set through configuration.  The site
        identifiers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the same across all GWs to the site (i.e., the
        same identifier is used by all GWs to the same site) and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
        unique across all sites that are connected (i.e., across all GWs to
        all sites that are interconnected).</li>
        <li>Each GW <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> construct an import filtering rule to import any
        route that carries a route target with the same site identifier that
        the GW itself uses.  This means that only these GWs will import those
        routes, and that all GWs to the same site will import each other's
        routes and will learn (auto-discover) the current set of active GWs
        for the site.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The auto-discovery route that each GW advertises consists of the following:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>IPv4 or IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) (<xref
        target="RFC4760" format="default"/>) containing one of the GW's
        loopback addresses (that is, with an AFI/SAFI pair that is one of the 
        following: IPv4/NLRI used for unicast forwarding (1/1); IPv6/NLRI used for
        unicast forwarding (2/1); IPv4/NLRI with MPLS Labels (1/4); or
        IPv6/NLRI with MPLS Labels (2/4)).</li>

       <li>A Tunnel Encapsulation attribute (<xref target="RFC9012"
       format="default"/>) containing the GW's encapsulation information
       encoded in one or more Tunnel TLVs.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>To avoid the side effect of applying the Tunnel Encapsulation
      attribute to any packet that is addressed to the GW itself, the address
      advertised for auto-discovery <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a different
      loopback address than is advertised for packets directed to the gateway
      itself.</t>
      <t>As described in <xref target="introduction" format="default"/>, each
      GW will include a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute with the GW
      encapsulation information for each of the site's active GWs (including
      itself) in every route advertised externally to that site.  As the
      current set of active GWs changes (due to the addition of a new GW or
      the failure/removal of an existing GW), each externally advertised route
      will be re-advertised with a new Tunnel Encapsulation attribute, which
      reflects the current set of active GWs.</t>
      <t>If a gateway becomes disconnected from the backbone network, or if
      the site operator decides to terminate the gateway's activity, it
      <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> withdraw the advertisements described above.  This
      means that remote gateways at other sites will stop seeing
      advertisements from or about this gateway.  Note that if the routing
      within a site is broken (for example, such that there is a route from
      one GW to another but not in the reverse direction), then it is
      possible that incoming traffic will be routed to the wrong GW to reach
      the destination prefix; in this degraded network situation, traffic may
      be dropped.</t>
      <t>Note that if a GW is (mis)configured with a different site identifier
      from the other GWs to the same site, then it will not be auto-discovered
      by the other GWs (and will not auto-discover the other GWs).  This would
      result in a GW for another site receiving only the Tunnel Encapsulation
      attribute included in the BGP best route, i.e., the Tunnel Encapsulation
      attribute of the (mis)configured GW or that of the other GWs.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="EPE" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Relationship to BGP - Link State and Egress Peer Engineering</name>
      <t>When a remote GW receives a route to a prefix X, it uses the Tunnel
      Egress Endpoint sub-TLVs in the containing Tunnel Encapsulation
      attribute to identify the GWs through which X can be reached.  It uses
      this information to compute SR Traffic Engineering (SR TE) paths across
      the backbone network looking at the information advertised to it in SR
      BGP - Link State (BGP-LS) (<xref
      target="RFC9085" format="default"/>) and
      correlated using the site identity.  SR Egress Peer Engineering (EPE)
      (<xref target="RFC9086"
      format="default"/>) can be used to supplement the information advertised
      in BGP-LS.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="advertising" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Advertising a Site Route Externally</name>
      <t>When a packet destined for prefix X is sent on an SR TE path to a GW
      for the site containing X (that is, the packet is sent in the ingress
      site on an SR TE path that describes the whole path including those
      parts that are within the egress site), it needs to carry the receiving
      GW's SID for X such that this SID becomes the next SID that is due to be
      processed before the GW completes its processing of the packet.  To
      achieve this, each Tunnel TLV in the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute
      contains a Prefix-SID sub-TLV (<xref target="RFC9012"
      format="default"/>) for X.</t>
      <t>As defined in <xref target="RFC9012" format="default"/>, the
      Prefix-SID sub-TLV is only for IPv4/IPV6 Labeled Unicast routes, so the
      solution described in this document only applies to routes of those
      types.  If the use of the Prefix-SID sub-TLV for routes of other types
      is defined in the future, further documents will be needed to describe
      their use for site interconnection consistent with this document.</t>
      <t>Alternatively, if MPLS SR is in use and if the GWs for a given egress
      site are configured to allow GWs at remote ingress sites to perform SR
      TE through that egress site for a prefix X, then each GW to the egress
      site computes an SR TE path through the egress site to X and places each
      in an MPLS Label Stack sub-TLV (<xref target="RFC9012"
      format="default"/>) in the SR Tunnel TLV for that GW.</t>

<t>
 If a site is configured to allow remote GWs to send packets to the site in
 the site's native encapsulation, then each GW to the site will also include
 multiple instances of a Tunnel TLV for that native encapsulation in
 externally advertised routes: one for each GW.  Each Tunnel TLV contains a
 Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV with the address of the GW that the Tunnel TLV
 identifies. A remote GW may then encapsulate a packet according to the rules
 defined via the sub-TLVs included in each of the Tunnel TLVs.</t>

      <t>From a protocol point of view, the mechanisms described in this
      document can leverage the security mechanisms already defined for BGP.
      Further discussion of security considerations for BGP may be found in
      the BGP specification itself (<xref target="RFC4271" format="default"/>)
      and in the security analysis for BGP (<xref target="RFC4272"
      format="default"/>).  The original discussion of the use of the TCP MD5
      signature option to protect BGP sessions is found in <xref
      target="RFC5925" format="default"/>, while <xref target="RFC6952"
      format="default"/> includes an analysis of BGP keying and authentication
      issues.</t>
      <t>The mechanisms described in this document involve sharing routing or
      reachability information between sites, which may mean disclosing
      information that is normally contained within a site.  So it needs to be
      understood that normal security paradigms based on the boundaries of
      sites are weakened and interception of BGP messages may result in
      information being disclosed to third parties.  Discussion of these
      issues with respect to VPNs can be found in <xref target="RFC4364"

        <li>Gateways to a site will know about all other gateways to the same

        be snooped or if a gateway can be subverted, then an attacker may learn
        the full set of gateways to a site.  This would facilitate more
        effective attacks on that site.</li>
        <li>The existence of multiple gateways to a site becomes more visible

        when only the locally attached backbone network (e.g., the AS that
        hosts the site) can see all of the gateways to a site.  For example, a
        Denial-of-Service attack on a single GW is mitigated by the existence
        of other GWs, but if the attacker knows about all the gateways, then
        the whole set can be attacked at once.</li>
        <li>A node in a site that does not have external BGP peering (i.e., is
        not really a site gateway and cannot speak BGP into the backbone
        network) may be able to get itself advertised as a gateway by letting
        other genuine gateways discover it (by speaking BGP to them within the
        site), so it may get those genuine gateways to advertise it as a
        gateway into the backbone network.  This would allow the malicious
        node to attract traffic without having to have secure BGP peerings
        with out-of-site nodes.</li>
        <li>An external party intercepting BGP messages anywhere between sites
        may learn information about the functioning of the sites and the
        locations of endpoints.  While this is not necessarily a significant
        security or privacy risk, it is possible that the disclosure of this
        information could be used by an attacker.</li>

        <li>If it is possible to modify a BGP message within the backbone, it
        may be possible to spoof the existence of a gateway.  This could cause
        traffic to be attracted to a specific node and might result in traffic
        not being delivered.
	</li>



      </ul>
      <t>All of the issues in the list above could cause disruption to site
      interconnection, but they are not new protocol vulnerabilities so much
      as new exposures of information that <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be protected
      against using existing protocol mechanisms such as securing the TCP
      sessions over which the BGP messages flow.  Furthermore, it is a general
      observation that if these attacks are possible, then it is highly likely
      that far more significant attacks can be made on the routing system.  It
      should be noted that BGP peerings are not discovered but always arise
      from explicit configuration.</t>
      <t>Given that the gateways and ASBRs are connected by tunnels that may
      run across parts of the network that are not trusted, data center
      operators using the approach set out in this network <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
      consider using gateway-to-gateway encryption to protect the data center
      traffic.  Additionally, due consideration <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be given
      to encrypting end-to-end traffic as it would be for any traffic that
      uses a public or untrusted network for transport.</t>

      <name>Manageability Considerations</name>
      <t>The principal configuration item added by this solution is the
      allocation of a site identifier.  The same identifier
      <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be assigned to every GW to the same site, and each
      site <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have a different identifier.  This requires
      coordination, probably through a central management agent.</t>
      <t>It should be noted that BGP peerings are not discovered but always
      arise from explicit configuration.  This is no different from any other
      BGP operation.</t>
      <t>The site identifiers that are configured and carried in route targets
      (see <xref target="DCGWautodisco" format="default"/>) are an important
      feature to ensure that all of the gateways to a site discover each
      other.  Therefore, it is important that this value is not misconfigured
      since that would result in the gateways not discovering each other and
      not advertising each other.</t>

        <name>Relationship to Route Target Constraint</name>

        <t>

 In order to limit the VPN routing information that is maintained at a given
 route reflector, <xref target="RFC4364"/> suggests that route reflectors use
 "Cooperative Route Filtering", which was renamed "Outbound Route Filtering"
 and defined in <xref target="RFC5291"/>.


<xref
        target="RFC4684" format="default"/> defines an extension to that
        mechanism to include support for multiple autonomous systems and
        asymmetric VPN topologies such as hub-and-spoke.  The mechanism in RFC
        4684 is known as Route Target Constraint (RTC).</t>

        <t>An operator would not normally configure RTC by default for any
        AFI/SAFI combination and would only enable it after careful
        consideration.  When using the mechanisms defined in this document,
        the operator should carefully consider the effects of filtering
        routes.  In some cases, this may be desirable, and in others, it could
        limit the effectiveness of the procedures.</t>
