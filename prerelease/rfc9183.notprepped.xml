      <t>
   A major issue in multilevel TRILL is how to manage RBridge nicknames.
   In this document, area border RBridges use a single nickname in both
   Level 1 and Level 2. RBridges in Level 2 must obtain unique nicknames
   but RBridges in different Level 1 areas may have the same nicknames.</t>

      <t>
   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) <xref target="RFC6325" format="default"/>
        <xref target="RFC7780" format="default"/> multilevel techniques are designed to improve TRILL
   scalability issues.</t>
      <t>
   "<xref target="RFC8243" format="title"/>" <xref target="RFC8243" format="default"/> is an educational
   document to explain multilevel TRILL and list possible concerns. It does
   not specify a protocol. As described in <xref target="RFC8243"
   format="default"/>, there have been two proposed approaches. One approach,
   which is referred to as the "unique nickname" approach, gives unique
   nicknames to all the TRILL switches in the multilevel campus either by
   having the Level 1/Level 2 border TRILL switches advertise which nicknames
   are not available for assignment in the area or by partitioning the 16-bit
   nickname into an "area" field and a "nickname inside the area" field. <xref
   target="RFC8397" format="default"/> is the Standards Track document
   specifying a "unique nickname" flavor of TRILL multilevel. The other
   approach, which is referred to in <xref target="RFC8243" format="default"/>
   as the "aggregated nickname" approach, involves assigning nicknames to the
   areas, and allowing nicknames to be reused inside different areas, by
   having the border TRILL switches rewrite the nickname fields when entering
   or leaving an area. <xref target="RFC8243" format="default"/> makes the
   case that, while unique nickname multilevel solutions are simpler,
   aggregated nickname solutions scale better.</t>
      <t>
   The approach specified in this Standards Track document is somewhat
   similar to the "aggregated nickname" approach in <xref target="RFC8243" format="default"/> but with a
   very important difference. In this document, the nickname of an area
   border RBridge is used in both Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2). No
   additional nicknames are assigned to represent L1 areas as such.
   Instead, multiple border RBridges are allowed and each L1 area is
   denoted by the set of all nicknames of those border RBridges of the
   area. For this approach, nicknames in the L2 area <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be unique but
   nicknames inside an L1 area can be reused in other L1 areas that also
   use this approach. The use of the approach specified in this document
   in one L1 area does not prohibit the use of other approaches in other
   L1 areas in the same TRILL campus, for example the use of the unique
   nickname approach specified in <xref target="RFC8397" format="default"/>. The TRILL packet format is
   unchanged by this document, but data plane processing is changed at
   Border RBridges and efficient high volume data flow at Border
   RBridges might require forwarding hardware change.</t>

      <t>
   In <xref target="fig-1"/>, RB2, RB20, RB3, and RB30 are area border TRILL switches
   (RBridges). Their nicknames are 2, 20, 3, and 30, respectively, and are
   used as TRILL switch identifiers in their areas <xref target="RFC6325" format="default"/>. Area
   border RBridges use the set of border nicknames to denote the L1 area
   that they are attached to. For example, RB2 and RB20 use nicknames
   {2,20} to denote the L1 area on the left.</t>
      <t>
   A source S is attached to RB27 and a destination D is attached to
   RB44. RB27 has a nickname (say, 27), and RB44 has a nickname (say, 44).
   (In fact, they could even have the same nickname, since the TRILL
   switch nickname will not be visible outside these Level 1 areas.)</t>
      <section anchor="sect-3.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Actions on Unicast Packets</name>
        <t>
   Let's say that S transmits a frame to destination D and let's say
   that D's location has been learned by the relevant TRILL switches
   already. These relevant switches have learned the following:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="%d)"><li>RB27 has learned that D is connected to nickname 3.</li>
          <li>RB3 has learned that D is attached to nickname 44.</li>
        </ol>
        <t>
   The following sequence of events will occur:

        </t>

<ol>

  <li>S transmits an Ethernet frame with source MAC = S and destination MAC =
  D.
  </li>

  <li>RB27 encapsulates with a TRILL header with ingress RBridge = 27 and
  egress RBridge = 3 producing a TRILL Data packet.
    </li>

   <li>RB2 and RB20 have announced in the Level 1 IS-IS area designated {2,20}
   that they are attached to the nicknames of all the border RBridges in the
   Level 2 area including RB3 and RB30. Therefore, IS-IS routes the packet to
   RB2 (or RB20, if RB20 is on the least-cost route from RB27 to RB3).
      </li>

      
    <li>RB2, when transitioning the packet from Level 1 to Level 2, replaces
    the ingress TRILL switch nickname with its own nickname, replacing 27 with
    2. Within Level 2, the ingress RBridge field in the TRILL header will
    therefore be 2, and the egress RBridge field will be 3. (The egress
    nickname <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be replaced with any area nickname selected
    from {3,30} such as 30. See <xref target="sect-4"/> for the detail of the
    selection method. Here, suppose the egress nickname remains 3.) Also, RB2
    learns that S is attached to nickname 27 in area {2,20} to accommodate
    return traffic. RB2 <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> synchronize with RB20 using the
    End Station Address Distribution Information (ESADI) protocol <xref
    target="RFC7357"/> that MAC = S is attached to nickname 27.
	</li>

     <li>The packet is forwarded through Level 2, to RB3, which has
     advertised, in Level 2, its L2 nickname as 3.
	  </li>


      <li>RB3, when forwarding into area {3,30}, replaces the egress nickname
      in the TRILL header with RB44's nickname (44) based on looking up
      D. (The ingress nickname <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be replaced with any area
      nickname selected from {2,20}. See <xref target="sect-4"/> for the
      detail of the selection method. Here, suppose the ingress nickname
      remains 2.)  So, within the destination area, the ingress nickname will
      be 2 and the egress nickname will be 44.
	    </li>


	          <li>RB44, when decapsulating, learns that S is attached to
	          nickname 2, which is one of the area nicknames of the
	          ingress.
	    </li>

        <name>Actions on Multi-destination Packets</name>
        <t>
   Distribution trees for flooding of multi-destination packets are calculated
   separately within each L1 area and in L2. When a multi-destination packet
   arrives at the border, it needs to be transitioned either from L1 to L2, or
   from L2 to L1. All border RBridges are eligible for Level
   transition. However, for each multi-destination packet, only one of them
   acts as the Designated Border RBridge (DBRB) to do the transition while
   other non-DBRBs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> drop the received copies.  By default,
   the border RBridge with the smallest nickname, considered as an unsigned
   integer, is elected DBRB.  All border RBridges of an area
   <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> agree on the mechanism used to determine the DBRB
   locally.  The use of an alternative is possible, but out of the scope of
   this document; one such mechanism is used in <xref target="sect-4"
   format="default"/> for load balancing.</t>
        <t>
	  As per <xref target="RFC6325" format="default"/>,

  multi-destination packets can be classified into three types: unicast
  packets with unknown destination MAC addresses (unknown-unicast packets),
  multicast packets, and broadcast packets. Now suppose that D's location has
  not been learned by RB27 or the frame received by RB27 is recognized as
  broadcast or multicast. What will happen within a Level 1 area (as it would
  in TRILL today) is that RB27 will forward the packet as multi-destination,
  setting its M bit to 1 and choosing an L1 tree, which would flood the packet
  on that distribution tree (subject to potential pruning).


	</t>

   <t>
   When the copies of the multi-destination packet arrive at area border
   RBridges, non-DBRBs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> drop the packet while the DBRB (say, RB2)
   needs to do the Level transition for the multi-destination packet.
   For an unknown-unicast packet, if the DBRB has learned the destination
   MAC address, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> convert the packet to unicast and set its M
   bit to 0. Otherwise, the multi-destination packet will continue to be
   flooded as a multicast packet on the distribution tree. The DBRB
   chooses the new distribution tree by replacing the egress nickname
   with the new tree root RBridge nickname from the area the packet is
   entering. The following sequence of events will occur:</t>

   <ol>
     <li>RB2, when transitioning the packet from Level 1 to Level 2, replaces
     the ingress TRILL switch nickname with its own nickname, replacing 27
     with 2. RB2 also <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> replace the egress RBridge nickname
     with an L2 tree root RBridge nickname (say, 39). In order to accommodate
     return traffic, RB2 records that S is attached to nickname 27 and
     <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the ESADI protocol <xref target="RFC7357"
     format="default"/> to synchronize this attachment information with other
     border RBridges (say, RB20) in the area.
     </li>
     
          <li>RB20 will receive the packet flooded on the L2 tree by RB2. It
          is important that RB20 does not transition this packet back to L1 as
          it does for a multicast packet normally received from another remote
          L1 area. RB20 should examine the ingress nickname of this packet. If
          this nickname is found to be a border RBridge nickname of the area
          {2,20}, RB2 must not forward the packet into this area.
	  </li>
	  
	       <li>The multi-destination packet is flooded on the Level 2 tree
	       to reach all border routers for all L1 areas including both RB3
	       and RB30. Suppose RB3 is the selected DBRB. The non-DBRB RB30
	       will drop the packet.
	       </li>
	       
	            <li>RB3, when forwarding into area {3,30}, replaces the
	            egress nickname in the TRILL header with the root RBridge
	            nickname of a distribution tree of L1 area {3,30} -- say,
	            30. (Here, the ingress nickname <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be
	            replaced with a different area nickname selected from
	            {2,20}, the set of border RBridges to the ingress area, as
	            specified in <xref target="sect-4" format="default"/>.)
	            Now suppose that RB27 has learned the location of D
	            (attached to nickname 3), but RB3 does not know where D is
	            because this information has fallen out of cache or RB3
	            has restarted or some other reason. In that case, RB3 must
	            turn the packet into a multi-destination packet and then
	            floods it on a distribution tree in the L1 area {3,30}.
		    </li>
		    
		         <li>RB30 will receive the packet flooded on the L1
		         tree by RB3. It is important that RB30 does not
		         transition this packet back to L2.  RB30 should also
		         examine the ingress nickname of this packet. If this
		         nickname is found to be an L2 Border RBridge
		         Nickname, RB30 must not transition the packet back to
		         L2.
			 </li>
			 
			      <li>The multicast listener RB44, when
			      decapsulating the received packet, learns that S
			      is attached to nickname 2, which is one of the
			      area nicknames of the ingress.

   Area border RBridges perform ingress/egress nickname replacement when they

   nickname will again be replaced when the packet transitions from Level 2 to
   Level 1. This nickname replacement enables the per-flow load balance, which

   When an L1 area is partitioned <xref target="RFC8243" format="default"/>,
   border RBridges will re-discover each other in both L1 and L2 through
   exchanging LSPs. In L2, the set of border RBridge nicknames for this

      <name>One Border RBridge Connects Multiple Areas</name>
      <t>
   It's possible that one border RBridge (say, RB1) connects multiple L1
   areas. RB1 <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use a single area nickname for itself for
   all these areas to minimize nickname consumption and the number of
   nicknames being advertised in L2; however, such a border RBridge might have
   to hold multiple nicknames -- for example, it might be the root of multiple
   L1 or multiple L2 distribution trees.</t>

      <t>
   Nicknames used within one of these L1 areas can be reused within other
   areas. It's important that packets destined to those duplicated nicknames
   are sent to the right area. Since these areas are connected to form a layer
   2 network, duplicated {MAC, Data Label} across these areas <bcp14>SHOULD
   NOT</bcp14> occur (see <xref target="RFC6325" section="4.2.6"
   sectionFormat="of" format="default"/> for tie breaking rules). Now suppose
   a TRILL Data packet arrives at the area border nickname of RB1. For a
   unicast packet, RB1 can look up the {MAC, Data Label} entry in its MAC
   table to identify the right destination area (i.e., the outgoing interface)
   and the egress RBridge's nickname.  For a multicast packet for each
   attached L1 area: either RB1 is not the DBRB and RB1 will not transition
   the packet, or RB1 is the DBRB. If RB1 is the DBRB, RB1 follows the
   following rules:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>If this packet originated from an area out of the connected areas,
      RB1 replicates this packet and floods it on the proper Level 1
      trees of all the areas in which it acts as the DBRB.</li>
        <li>If the packet originated from one of the connected areas, RB1
      replicates the packet it receives from the Level 1 tree and floods
      it on other proper Level 1 trees of all the areas in which it acts
      as the DBRB except the originating area (i.e., the area connected
      to the incoming interface). RB1 might also receive the replication
      of the packet from the Level 2 tree. This replication <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
      dropped by RB1. It recognizes such packets by their ingress
      nickname being the nickname of one of the border RBridges of an L1
      area for which the receiving border RBridge is DBRB.</li>

      <name>Manageability Considerations</name>
      <t>
   If an L1 Border RBridge Nickname is configured at an RBridge and that
   RBridge has both L1 and L2 adjacencies, the multilevel feature as specified
   in this document is turned on for that RBridge and normally uses an L2
   nickname in both L1 and L2 although, as provided below, such an RBridge may
   have to fall back to multilevel unique nickname behavior <xref
   target="RFC8397" format="default"/>, in which case it uses this L1 nickname.
   In contrast, unique nickname multilevel as specified in <xref
   target="RFC8397" format="default"/> is enabled by the presence of L1 and L2
   adjacencies without an L1 Border RBridge Nickname being configured.
   RBridges supporting only unique nickname multilevel do not support the
   configuration of an L2 Border RBridge Nickname.  RBridges supporting only
   the single-level TRILL base protocol specified in <xref target="RFC6325"
   format="default"/> do not support L2 adjacencies.</t>

      <t>
   RBridges that support and are configured to use single nickname multilevel
   as specified in this document <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support unique nickname
   multilevel <xref target="RFC8397" format="default"/>.  If there are
   multiple border RBridges between an L1 area and L2, and one or more of them
   only support or are only configured for unique nickname multilevel <xref
   target="RFC8397" format="default"/>, any of these border RBridges that are
   configured to use single nickname multilevel <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> fall back
   to behaving as a unique nickname border RBridge for that L1 area. Because
   overlapping sets of RBridges may be the border RBridges for different L1
   areas, an RBridge supporting single nickname <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to
   simultaneously support single nickname for some of its L1 areas and unique
   nickname for others. For example, RB1 and RB2 might be border RBridges for
   L1 area A1 using single nickname while RB2 and RB3 are border RBridges for
   area A2. If RB3 only supports unique nicknames, then RB2 must fall back to
   unique nickname for area A2 but continue to support single nickname for
   area A1. Operators <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be notified when this fallback
   occurs. The presence of border RBridges using unique nickname multilevel
   can be detected because they advertise in L1 the blocks of nicknames
   available within that L1 area.</t>
      <t>
   In both the unique nickname approach specified in <xref target="RFC8397"
   format="default"/> and the single nickname aggregated approach specified in
   this document, an RBridge that has L1 and L2 adjacencies uses the same
   nickname in L1 and L2.  If an RBridge is configured with an L1 Border
   RBridge Nickname for any a Level 1 area, it uses this nickname across the
   Level 2 area. This L1 Border RBridge Nickname cannot be used in any other
   Level 1 area except other Level 1 areas for which the same RBridge is a
   border RBridge with this L1 Border RBridge Nickname configured.</t>
      <t>
   In addition to the manageability considerations specified above, the
   manageability specifications in <xref target="RFC6325" format="default"/>
   still apply.</t>
      <t>
   Border RBridges replace ingress and/or egress nickname when a TRILL Data
   packet traverses a TRILL L2 area. A TRILL Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance (OAM) message will be forwarded through the multilevel single
   nickname TRILL campus using a MAC address belonging to the destination
   RBridge <xref target="RFC7455" format="default"/>.</t>

   For general TRILL Security Considerations, see <xref target="RFC6325"

      <t>
   The newly defined TRILL APPsub-TLVs in <xref target="sect-5"
   format="default"/> are transported in IS-IS PDUs whose authenticity can be
   enforced using regular IS-IS security mechanism <xref target="IS-IS"/>
   <xref target="RFC5310" format="default"/>. Malicious devices may also fake
   the APPsub-TLVs to attract TRILL Data packets, interfere with multilevel
   TRILL operation, induce excessive state in TRILL switches (or in any
   bridges that may be part of the TRILL campus), etc.  For this reason,
   RBridges <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be configured to use the IS-IS
   Authentication TLV (10) in their IS-IS PDUs so that IS-IS security <xref
   target="RFC5310" format="default"/> can be used to authenticate those PDUs
   and discard them if they are forged.</t>
      <t>
   Using a variation of aggregated nicknames, and the resulting possible
   duplication of nicknames between areas, increases the possibility of a
   TRILL Data packet being delivered to the wrong egress RBridge if areas are
   unexpectedly merged as compared with a scheme where all nicknames in the
   TRILL campus are, except as a transient condition, unique such as the
   scheme in <xref target="RFC8397" format="default"/>. However, in many
   cases, the data would be discarded at that egress RBridge because it would
   not match a known end station Data Label / MAC address.</t>

      <name>Level Transition Clarification</name>
      <t>
   It's possible that an L1 RBridge is only reachable from a non-DBRB
   border RBridge. If this non-DBRB RBridge refrains from Level
   transition, the question is, how can a multicast packet reach this L1
   RBridge? The answer is, it will be reached after the DBRB performs
   the Level transition and floods the packet using an L1 distribution
   tree.</t>
      <t>
   Take the following figure as an example. RB77 is reachable from the
   border RBridge RB30 while RB3 is the DBRB. RB3 transitions the
   multicast packet into L1 and floods the packet on the distribution
   tree rooted from RB3. This packet is finally flooded to RB77 via
   RB30.</t>

      <t>
   In the above example, the multicast packet is forwarded along a non-optimal
   path. A possible improvement is to have RB3 configured not to belong to
   this area. In this way, RB30 will surely act as the DBRB to do the Level
   transition.</t>
