    <abstract>
      <t>This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic
      Optimization (ALTO) protocol.  It extends the ALTO cost information
      service so that applications decide not only 'where' to connect but
      also 'when'.  This is useful for applications that need to perform bulk
      data transfer and would like to schedule these transfers during an
      off-peak hour, for example.  This extension introduces the ALTO Cost
      Calendar with which an ALTO Server exposes ALTO cost values in JSON
      arrays where each value corresponds to a given time interval.  The time
      intervals, as well as other Calendar attributes, are specified in the
      Information Resources Directory and ALTO Server responses.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol
      specified in <xref target="RFC7285" format="default"/> provides guidance
      to overlay applications that need to select one or several hosts from a
      set of candidates able to provide a desired resource.  This guidance is
      based on parameters that affect performance and efficiency of the data
      transmission between the hosts, such as the topological distance.  The
      goal of ALTO is to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) in the
      application while optimizing resource usage in the underlying network
      infrastructure.</t> 
      <t>The ALTO protocol in <xref target="RFC7285" format="default"/>
      specifies a network map that defines groupings of endpoints in
      provider-defined network regions identified by Provider-defined
      Identifiers (PIDs).  The Cost Map Service, Endpoint Cost Service (ECS),
      and Endpoint Ranking Service then provide ISP-defined costs and rankings
      for connections among the specified endpoints and PIDs and thus
      incentives for application clients to connect to ISP-preferred
      locations, for instance, to reduce their costs.  For the reasons
      outlined in the ALTO problem statement <xref target="RFC5693"
      format="default"/> and requirement AR-14 of <xref target="RFC6708"
      format="default"/>, ALTO does not disseminate network metrics that
      change frequently.  In a network, the costs can fluctuate for many
      reasons having to do with instantaneous traffic load or diurnal
      patterns of traffic demand or planned events, such as network
      maintenance, holidays, or highly publicized events.  Thus, an ALTO
      application wishing to use the Cost Map and Endpoint Cost Service at
      some future time will have to estimate the state of the network at that
      time, a process that is, at best, fragile and brittle, since the
      application does not have any visibility into the state of the network.
      Providing network costs for only the current time thus may not be
      sufficient, in particular for applications that can schedule their
      traffic in a span of time, for example, by deferring backups or other
      background traffic to off- peak hours.</t> 
      <t>In case the ALTO cost value changes are predictable over a certain
      period of time and the application does not require immediate data
      transfer, it can save time to get the whole set of cost values over this
      period in one single ALTO response.  Using this set to schedule data
      transfers allows optimizing the network resources usage and QoE. ALTO
      Clients and Servers can also minimize their workload by reducing and
      accordingly scheduling their data exchanges.</t> 
      <t>This document extends <xref target="RFC7285" format="default"/> to
      allow an ALTO Server to provide network costs for a given duration of
      time.  A sequence of network costs across a time span for a given pair
      of network locations is named an "ALTO Cost Calendar".  The Filtered
      Cost Map Service and Endpoint Cost Service are extended to provide Cost
      Calendars.  In addition to this functional ALTO enhancement, we expect
      to further save network and storage resources by gathering multiple cost
      values for one cost type into one single ALTO Server response.</t> 
      <t>In this document, an "ALTO Cost Calendar" is specified in terms of
      information resource capabilities that are applicable to time-sensitive
      ALTO metrics.  An ALTO Cost Calendar exposes ALTO cost values in JSON
      arrays, see <xref target="RFC8259" format="default"/>, where each value
      corresponds to a given time interval.  The time intervals, as well as
      other Calendar attributes, are specified in the Information Resources
      Directory (IRD) and in the Server response to allow the ALTO Client to
      interpret the received ALTO values.  Last, the extensions for ALTO
      Calendars are applicable to any cost mode, and they ensure backwards
      compatibility with legacy ALTO Clients -- those that only support <xref
      target="RFC7285" format="default"/>.</t> 
      <t>In the rest of this document, <xref target="sect-3"
      format="default"/> provides the design characteristics.  Sections <xref
      target="sect-4" format="counter"/> and <xref target="sect-5"
      format="counter"/> define the formal specifications for the IRD and the
      information resources. IANA, security considerations, and operational
      considerations are addressed respectively in Sections <xref
      target="sect-6" format="counter"/>, <xref target="sect-7"
      format="counter"/>, and <xref target="sect-8" format="counter"/>.</t>  
      <section anchor="sect-1.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Some Recent Known Uses</name>
        <t> A potential use case is implementing smart network services that
	allow applications to dynamically build end-to-end, virtual networks
	to satisfy given demands with no manual intervention. For  example,
	data-transfer automation applications may need a network service to
	determine the availability of bandwidth resources to decide when
	to transfer their data sets. The SENSE project  <xref
	target="SENSE" format="default"/> supports such
	applications by requiring that a network provides services such as the
	Time-Bandwidth-Product (TBP) service, which informs applications of
	bandwidth availability during a specific time period. ALTO Calendars
	can support this service if the Calendar start date and duration cover
	the period of interest of the requesting application.</t> 
        <t>The need of future scheduling of large-scale traffic that can be
	addressed by the ALTO protocol is also motivated by Unicorn, a unified
	resource orchestration framework for multi-domain, geo-distributed
	data analytics, see <xref target="UNICORN-FGCS"
	format="default"/>.</t>

      <name>Overview of ALTO Cost Calendars and Terminology</name>
      <t>This section gives a high-level overview of the design. 

      It assumes the reader is familiar with the ALTO protocol <xref
      target="RFC7285" format="default"/> and its Multi-Cost ALTO extension
      <xref target="RFC8189" format="default"/>.</t> 
      <section anchor="sect-3.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>ALTO Cost Calendar Overview</name>
        <t>An ALTO Cost Calendar provided by the ALTO Server provides 2
         information items:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>an array of values for a given metric, where each value
	  specifies the metric corresponding to a time interval, where the
	  value array can sometimes be a cyclic pattern that repeats a certain
	  number of times and</li> 
          <li>attributes describing the time scope of the Calendar, including
	  the size and number of the intervals and the date of the starting
	  point of the Calendar, allowing an ALTO Client to interpret the
	  values properly.</li> 
        </ul>
        <t>An ALTO Cost Calendar can be used like a "time table" to figure out
	the best time to schedule data transfers and also to proactively
	manage application traffic given predictable events, such as an expected
	spike in traffic due to crowd gathering (concerts, sports, etc.),
	traffic-intensive holidays, and network maintenance.  A Calendar may be
	viewed as a synthetic abstraction of, for example, real measurements
	gathered over previous periods on which statistics have been computed.
	However, like for any schedule, unexpected network incidents may
	require the current ALTO Calendar to be updated and resent to the
	ALTO Clients needing it.  The "ALTO Incremental Updates Using
	Server-Sent Events (SSE)" Service <xref target="RFC8895"
	format="default"/> can be used to  directly update the Calendar upon
	value changes if supported by both the Server and the Client.</t> 
        <t>
   Most likely, the ALTO Cost Calendar would be used for the Endpoint
   Cost Service, assuming that a limited set of feasible endpoints for a
   non-real time application is already identified, and that those
   endpoints do not need to be accessed immediately and that their
   access can be scheduled within a given time period.
	The Filtered Cost Map Service is also
	applicable as long as the size of the Map allows it.</t>

      <section anchor="sect-3.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>ALTO Cost Calendar Information Features</name>
        <t>
   The Calendar attributes are provided in the Information Resources
   Directory (IRD) and in ALTO Server responses.  The IRD announces
   attributes without date values
   in its information resources capabilities, whereas attributes with 
   time-dependent values are provided in the "meta" section of Server responses.  
   The ALTO Cost Calendar attributes provide the following information:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>attributes to describe the time scope of the Calendar value array:
            </t>
            <ul spacing="normal">

	      <li>"time-interval-size": the applicable time interval size for
	      each Calendar value, defined in seconds, that can cover a wide
	      range of values.</li> 
              <li>"number-of-intervals": the number of intervals provided in
	      the Calendar.</li> 
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>"calendar-start-time": specifying when the Calendar starts; that
	  is, to which date the first value of the Cost Calendar is
	  applicable.</li> 
          <li>"repeated": an optional attribute indicating how many iterations
	  of the provided Calendar will have the same values.  The Server may
	  use it to allow the Client to schedule its next request and thus
	  save its own workload by reducing processing of similar
	  requests.</li> 
        </ul>
        <t>Attribute "repeated" may take a very high value if a Calendar
	represents a cyclic value pattern that the Server considers valid for
	a long period.  In this case, the Server will only update the Calendar
	values once this period has elapsed or if an unexpected event occurs
	on the network. See <xref target="sect-8" format="default"/> for more
	discussion.</t> 
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-3.3" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>ALTO Calendar Design Characteristics</name>
        <t>The present document uses the notations defined in "Notation"
	(<xref target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of" section="8.2"/>).</t>
        <t>The extensions in this document encode requests and responses using
	JSON <xref target="RFC8259" format="default"/>.</t> 

        <t>In the base protocol <xref target="RFC7285"/>, an ALTO cost is
        specified as a generic JSONValue <xref target="RFC8259"
        format="default"/> to allow extensions. However, that section (<xref
        target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of" section="11.2.3.6"/>) states:</t>
	<blockquote>An implementation of the protocol in
	this document
	<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> assume that the cost is a JSONNumber and fail to
	parse if it is not, unless the implementation is using an extension to
	this document that indicates when and how costs of other data types
	are signaled.</blockquote>
        <t>The present document extends the definition of a legacy cost map
	given in <xref target="RFC7285" format="default"/> to allow a cost
	entry to be an array of values, with one value per time interval,
	instead of being just one number, when the Cost Calendar functionality
	is activated on this cost. Therefore, the implementor of this extension
	<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> consider that a cost entry is an array of values
	if this cost has been queried as a Calendar. </t> 
        <t> Specifically, an implementation of this extension
	<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> parse the "number-of-intervals" attribute of the
	Calendar attributes in an IRD entry announcing a service providing a
	Cost Calendar for a given cost type. The implementation then will know
	that a cost entry of the service will be an array of values, and the
	expected size of the array is that specified by the
	"number-of-intervals" attribute. The following rules attempt to ensure
	consistency between the array size announced by the Server and the
	actual size of the array received by the Client:</t> 
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The size of the array of values conveyed in a Cost Calendar and
	  received by the Client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be equal to the value of
	  attribute "number-of-intervals" indicated in the IRD for the
	  requested cost type.</li> 
          <li>When the size of the array received by the Client is different
	  from the expected size, the Client <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> ignore the
	  received array.</li> 
        </ul>
        <t>To realize an ALTO Calendar, this document extends the IRD and the
	ALTO requests and responses for Cost Calendars.</t> 
        <t>This extension is designed to be lightweight and to ensure
	backwards compatibility with base protocol ALTO Clients and with other
	extensions.  It relies on "Parsing of Unknown Fields" (<xref
	target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of" section="8.3.7"/>), which states:
	"Extensions may include additional fields within JSON objects defined
	in this document.  ALTO implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore
	unknown fields when processing ALTO messages."</t> 
        <t>The Calendar-specific capabilities are integrated in the
	information resources of the IRD and in the "meta" member of ALTO
	responses to Cost Calendars requests.  A Calendar and its capabilities
	are associated with a given information resource and within this
	information resource with a given cost type.  This design has several
	advantages:</t> 
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>it does not introduce a new mode,</li>
          <li>it does not introduce new media types, and</li>
          <li>it allows an ALTO Server to offer, for a cost type, different
	  Calendars with attributes that are specific to the information
	  resources providing a Calendar for this cost type, instead of being
	  globally specific to the cost type.</li> 
        </ul>
        <t>The applicable Calendared information resources are:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>the Filtered Cost Map and</li>
          <li>the Endpoint Cost Map.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The ALTO Server can choose in which frequency it provides cost
	Calendars to ALTO Clients.  It may either provide Calendar updates
	starting at the request date or carefully schedule its updates so as
	to take profit from a potential repetition/periodicity of Calendar
	values.</t> 
        <t>Since Calendar attributes are specific to an information resource,
	a Server may adapt the granularity of the calendared information so as
	to moderate the volume of exchanged data. For example, suppose a
	Server provides a Calendar for cost type name "routingcost". The
	Server may offer a Calendar in a Cost Map resource, which may be a
	voluminous resource, as an array of 6 intervals lasting each 4
	hours. It may also offer a Calendar in an Endpoint Cost Map resource,
	which is potentially less voluminous, as a finer-grained array of 24
	intervals lasting 1 hour each.</t> 
        <t>The ALTO Server does not support constraints on Calendars, provided
	Calendars are requested for numerical values, for two main
	reasons:</t> 
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Constraints on an array of values may be various. For instance,
	  some Clients may refuse Calendars with one single value violating a
	  constraint, whereas other ones may tolerate Calendars with values
	  violating constraints, for example, at given times. Therefore,
	  expressing constraints in a way that covers all possible Client
	  preferences is challenging.</li> 
          <li>If constraints were to be supported, the processing overhead
	  would be substantial for the Server as it would have to parse all
	  the values of the Calendar array before returning a response. </li> 
        </ul>
        <t>As providing the constraint functionality in conjunction with the
	Calendar functionality is not feasible for the reasons described
	above, the two features are mutually exclusive. The absence of
	constraints on Filtered Cost Map and Endpoint Cost Map Calendars
	reflects a divergence from the non-calendared information resources
	defined in <xref target="RFC7285" format="default"/> and extended in
	<xref target="RFC8189" format="default"/>, which support optional
	constraints. </t>

          <name>ALTO Cost Calendar for All Cost Modes</name>
          <t>An ALTO Cost Calendar is well suited for values encoded in the
	  "numerical" mode.  Actually, a Calendar can also represent metrics
	  in other modes considered as compatible with time-varying
	  values. For example, types of cost values (such as JSONBool) can also
	  be calendared (as their value may be 'true' or 'false' depending on
	  given time periods or likewise) values represented by strings, such
	  as "medium", "high", "low", "blue", and "open".</t> 
          <t>Note also that a Calendar is suitable as well for time-varying
	  metrics provided in the "ordinal" mode if these values are
	  time-varying and the ALTO Server provides updates of

          <t>The ALTO protocol extensions for Cost Calendars have been defined
	  so as to ensure that Calendar-capable ALTO Servers can provide

	<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> appear more than once in the

        <name>Calendars in a Delegate IRD</name>
        <t>It may be useful to distinguish IRD resources supported by the base
	ALTO protocol from resources supported by its extensions. To achieve
	this, one option is that a "root" ALTO Server implementing <xref
	target="RFC7285" format="default"/> resources and running at a given
	domain delegates "specialized" information resources, such as the ones
	providing Cost Calendars, to another ALTO Server running in a
	subdomain. The "root" ALTO Server can provide a Calendar-specific
	resource entry that has a media-type of
	"application/alto-directory+json" and that specifies the  URI allowing
	to retrieve the location of a Calendar-aware Server and discover its
	resources. This option is described in "Delegation Using IRD" (<xref
	target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of" section="9.2.4"/>).</t> 
        <t>This document provides an example where a "root" ALTO Server runs
	in a domain called "alto.example.com".  It delegates the announcement
	of Calendars capabilities to an ALTO Server running in a subdomain
	called "custom.alto.example.com".  The location of the "delegate
	Calendar IRD" is assumed to be indicated in the "root" IRD by the
	resource entry: "custom-calendared-resources".</t> 
        <t>
	Another benefit of delegation is that some cost types for some resources 
	may be more advantageous as Cost Calendars, and it makes little sense to get them 
	as a single value. For example, if a cost type has predictable and frequently 
	changing values calendared in short time intervals, such as a minute, 
	it saves time and network resources to track the cost values via a focused 
	delegate Server rather than the more general "root" Server.</t>

        <name>Example IRD with ALTO Cost Calendars</name>
        <t>This section provides an example ALTO Server IRD that supports
	various cost metrics and cost modes.  In particular, since <xref

	uses metric "routingcost" in the "numerical" mode.</t> 
        <t>For illustrative purposes, this section introduces 3 other
	fictitious example metrics and modes that should be understood as
	examples and should not be used or considered as normative.</t>

          <dt>"num-routingcost":</dt>
	  <dd>Refers to metric "routingcost" in the

          <dt>"num-owdelay":</dt>
	  <dd>Refers to fictitious performance metric "owdelay"
	  in the "numerical" mode to reflect the one-way packet transmission
	  delay on a path.  A related performance metric is currently under
	  definition in <xref target="I-D.ietf-alto-performance-metrics"
	  format="default"/>.</dd> 
          <dt>"num-throughputrating":</dt>
	  <dd>Refers to fictitious metric
	  "throughputrating" in the "numerical" mode to reflect the provider
	  preference in terms of end-to-end throughput.</dd> 
          <dt>"string-servicestatus":</dt>
	  <dd>Refers to fictitious metric
	  "servicestatus" containing a string to reflect the availability,
	  defined by the provider, of, for instance, path connectivity.</dd> 
        </dl>
        <t>The example IRD includes 2 particular URIs providing Calendars:</t>

	  "num-throughputrating", and "string-servicestatus".</dd> 
        </dl>
        <t>The design of the Calendar capabilities allows some Calendars with
	the same cost type name to be available in several information
	resources with different Calendar attributes.  This is the case for
	Calendars on "num-routingcost", "num-throughputrating", and
	"string-servicestatus", available in both the Filtered Cost Map and
	Endpoint Cost Service but with different time interval sizes for
	"num-throughputrating" and "string-servicestatus".</t>

          <dl newline="true" spacing="normal">

	    <dd>An array of one or more cost type names to which the value

            <dt>"calendar-start-time":</dt>
	    <dd>Indicates the date at which the first value of the Calendar

	    field using the IMF-fixdate format specified in <xref

	    the iteration provided in the returned response.</dd> 
          </dl>
          <t>For example, suppose the "calendar-start-time" member has value
	  "Mon, 30 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT", the "time-interval-size" member has
	  value '3600', the "number-of-intervals" member has value '24', and
	  the value of member "repeated" is equal to '4'.  This means that the
	  Calendar values are the same on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
	  Thursday on a period of 24 hours starting at 00:00:00 GMT.  The ALTO
	  Client thus may use the same Calendar for the next 4 days starting
	  at "calendar-start-time" and will only need to request a new one for
	  Friday, July 4th at 00:00:00 GMT.</t> 
          <t>Attribute "repeated" may take a very high value if a Calendar
	  represents a cyclic value pattern that the Server considers valid
	  for a long period and hence will only update once this period has
	  elapsed or if an unexpected event occurs on the network.  In the
	  latter case, the Client will be notified if it uses the "ALTO
	  Incremental Updates Using Server-Sent Events (SSE)" Service,
	  specified in <xref target="RFC8895" format="default"/>.  To this
	  end, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that ALTO Servers providing
	  ALTO Calendars also provide the "ALTO Incremental Updates Using
	  Server-Sent Events (SSE)" Service, which is specified in <xref
	  target="RFC8895" format="default"/>.  Likewise, ALTO Clients capable
	  of using ALTO Calendars <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also use the SSE
	  Service.  See also discussion in <xref target="sect-8"

          <name>Use Case and Example: FCM with a Bandwidth Calendar</name>
          <t>An example of non-real-time information that can be provisioned
	  in a Calendar is the expected path throughput.  While the
	  transmission rate can be measured in real time by end systems, the
	  operator of a data center is in the position of formulating
	  preferences for given paths at given time periods to avoid traffic
	  peaks due to diurnal usage patterns.  In this example, we assume
	  that an ALTO Client requests a Calendar of network-provider-defined
	  throughput ratings as specified in the IRD to schedule its bulk
	  data transfers as described in the use cases.</t> 
          <t>In the example IRD, Calendars for cost type name
	  "num-throughputrating" are available for the information resources
	  "filtered-cost-calendar-map" and "endpoint-cost-map-calendar".  The
	  ALTO Client requests a Calendar for "num-throughputrating" via a
	  POST request for a Filtered Cost Map.</t> 
          <t>
   We suppose in the present example that the ALTO Client sends its
   request on Tuesday, July 1st 2019 at 13:15.  The Server returns
   Calendars with arrays of 12 numbers for each source and destination
   pair.  The values for metric "throughputrating", in this example, are
   assumed to be encoded in 2 digits.</t>

          <t>When receiving the response, the Client sees that the Calendar
	  values for metric "routingcost" are repeated for 4 iterations.
	  Therefore, in its next requests until the "routingcost" Calendar is
	  expected to change, the Client will only need to request a Calendar
	  for "owdelay".</t> 
          <t>
   Without the ALTO Calendar extensions, the ALTO Client would have no
   clue on the dynamicity of the metric value change and would spend
   needless time requesting values at an inappropriate pace.  In
   addition, without the Multi-Cost ALTO capabilities, the ALTO Client
   would duplicate this waste of time as it would need to send one
   request per cost metric.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>As an extension of the base ALTO protocol <xref target="RFC7285"
      format="default"/>, this document fits into the architecture of the base
      protocol and hence the security considerations (<xref target="RFC7285"
      sectionFormat="of" section="15"/>) fully apply when this extension is
      provided by an ALTO Server.  For example, the same authenticity and
      integrity considerations (<xref target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of"
      section="15.1"/>) still fully apply; the same considerations for the
      privacy of ALTO users (<xref target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of"
      section="15.4"/>) also still fully apply.</t> 
      <t>
   The calendaring information provided by this extension requires
   additional considerations on three security considerations discussed
   in <xref target="RFC7285" format="default"/>: potential undesirable guidance to Clients
   (<xref target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of" section="15.2"/>), confidentiality of ALTO information
   (<xref target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of" section="15.3"/>), and
   availability of ALTO (<xref target="RFC7285"
   sectionFormat="of" section="15.5"/>).  For example, by providing network information in the
   future in a Calendar, this extension may improve availability of
   ALTO when the ALTO Server is unavailable but related information is
   already provided in the Calendar.</t>
      <t>
   For confidentiality of ALTO information, an operator should be
   cognizant that this extension may introduce a new risk, a malicious ALTO
   Client may get information for future events that are scheduled
   through Calendaring.  Possessing such information, the malicious Client may use
   it to generate massive connections to the network at times where its load
   is expected to be high.</t>
      <t>To mitigate this risk, the operator should address the risk of ALTO
      information being leaked to malicious Clients or third parties. As
      specified in "Protection Strategies" (<xref target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of"
      section="15.3.2"/>), the ALTO Server should 
      authenticate ALTO Clients and use the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
      protocol so that man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks to intercept an ALTO
      Calendar are not possible. "Authentication and Encryption" (<xref target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of"
      section="8.3.5"/>) ensures the availability of such a
      solution. It specifies that "ALTO
      Server implementations as well as ALTO Client implementations
      <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support the "https" URI scheme of <xref
      target="RFC2818" format="default"/> and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
      of <xref target="RFC5246" format="default"/>".</t> 
      <t>Section <xref target="RFC8446" sectionFormat="bare" section="1"/> of
      TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/> states: "While TLS 1.3 is not directly compatible with previous
      versions, all versions of TLS incorporate a versioning mechanism which
      allows Clients and Servers to interoperably negotiate a common version
      if one is supported by both peers". ALTO Clients and Servers
      <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> support both TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"
      format="default"/> and TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246" format="default"/>
      and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> support and use newer versions of TLS as long as
      the negotiation process succeeds.</t> 
      <t>The operator should be cognizant that the preceding mechanisms do not
      address all security risks. In particular, they will not help in the
      case of "malicious Clients" possessing valid authentication
      credentials. The threat here is that legitimate Clients have become
      subverted by an attacker and are now 'bots' being asked to participate
      in a DDoS attack. The Calendar information now becomes valuable in
      knowing exactly when to perpetrate a DDoS attack. A mechanism, such as a
      monitoring system that detects abnormal behaviors, may still be needed.</t> 

      <t>To avoid malicious or erroneous guidance from ALTO information, an
      ALTO Client should be cognizant that using calendaring information can
      have risks: (1) Calendar values, especially in "repeated" Calendars, may
      be only statistical and (2) future events may change. Hence, a more
      robust ALTO Client should adapt and extend protection strategies
      specified in <xref target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of" section="15.2"/>.
      For example, to be notified immediately when a particular ALTO value
      that the Client depends on changes, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>
      that both the ALTO Client and ALTO Server using this extension support
      "Application-Layer Traffic
              Optimization (ALTO) Incremental Updates Using Server-Sent
              Events (SSE)" <xref
      target="RFC8895" format="default"/>.</t> 
      <t>Another risk of erroneous guidance appears when the Server exposes an
      occurrence of a same cost type name in different elements of the
      Calendar objects array associated to an information resource. In this
      case, there is no way for the Client to figure out which Calendar object
      in the array is valid. The specification in this document recommends, in
      this case, that the Client uses the first encountered Calendar object
      occurrence containing the cost type name. However, the Client may want
      to avoid the risks of erroneous guidance associated to the use of
      potentially invalid Calendar values. To this end, as an alternative to
      the recommendation in this document, the Client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
      ignore the totality of occurrences of CalendarAttributes objects
      containing the cost type name and query this cost type using <xref
      target="RFC7285" format="default"/>.</t> 
    </section>
    <section anchor="sect-8" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Operational Considerations</name>
      <t>It is important that both the operator of the network and the
      operator of the applications consider both the feedback aspect and the
      prediction-based (uncertainty) aspect of using the Cost Calendar.</t> 
      <t>First, consider the feedback aspect and consider the Cost Calendar as
      a traffic-aware map service (e.g., Google Maps). Using the service
      without considering its own effect, a large fleet can turn a
      not-congested road into a congested one; a large number of individual
      cars each choosing a road with light traffic ("cheap link") can also
      result in congestion or result in a less-optimal global outcome (e.g.,
      the Braess' Paradox <xref target="BRAESS_PARADOX"
      format="default"/>).</t> 
      <t>Next, consider the prediction aspect. Conveying ALTO Cost Calendars
      tends to reduce the on-the-wire data exchange volume compared to
      multiple single-cost ALTO transactions. An application using Calendars
      has a set of time-dependent values upon which it can plan its
      connections in advance with no need for the ALTO Client to query
      information at each time. Additionally, the Calendar response attribute
      "repeated", when provided, saves additional data exchanges in that it
      indicates that the ALTO Client does not need to query Calendars during a
      period indicated by this attribute. The preceding is true only when
      "accidents" do not happen.</t> 
      <t>Although individual network operators and application operators can
      choose their own approaches to address the aforementioned issues, this
      document recommends the following considerations. First, a typical
      approach to reducing instability and handling uncertainty is to ensure
      timely update of information. The SSE Service, as discussed in <xref
      target="sect-7" format="default"/>, can handle updates if supported by
      both the Server and the Client. Second, when a network operator updates
      the Cost Calendar and when an application reacts to the update, they
      should consider the feedback effects. This is the best approach even
      though there is theoretical analysis <xref
      target="SELFISH_RTG_2002" format="default"/> and
      Internet-based evaluation <xref target="SELFISH_RTG_2003"
      format="default"/> showing that uncoordinated behaviors do not always
      cause substantial suboptimal results.</t> 
      <t>
         High-resolution intervals may be needed when values change, sometimes
         during very small time intervals but in a significant manner.  A way
         to avoid conveying too many entries is to leverage on the "repeated"
         feature.  A Server can smartly set the Calendar start time and number
         of intervals so as to declare them "repeated" for a large number of
         periods until the Calendar values change and are conveyed to
         requesting Clients.
      </t>
      <t>The newer JSON Data Interchange Format specification <xref
      target="RFC8259" format="default"/> used in ALTO Calendars replaces the
      older one <xref target="RFC7159" format="default"/> used in the base
      ALTO protocol <xref target="RFC7285" format="default"/>. The newer JSON
      mandates UTF-8 text encoding to improve interoperability. Therefore,
      ALTO Clients and Servers implementations using UTF-{16,32} need to be
      cognizant of the subsequent interoperability risks and
      <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> switch to UTF-8 encoding if they want to
      interoperate with Calendar-aware Servers and Clients.</t>
