      <t>
	This specification defines how a series of Security Event Tokens
        (SETs) can be delivered to an intended recipient
        using HTTP POST over TLS initiated as a poll by the recipient. The
        specification also defines how delivery can be assured, subject to
        the SET Recipient's need for assurance.

      <name>Introduction and Overview</name>
      <t>
        This specification defines how a stream of
	Security Event Tokens (SETs) <xref target="RFC8417" format="default"/>
        can be transmitted to an intended
        SET Recipient using HTTP <xref target="RFC7231" format="default"/>
        over TLS. The specification defines a method to poll for SETs
        using HTTP POST.
	This is an alternative SET delivery method to the one defined in
	<xref target="RFC8935" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	Poll-based SET delivery is intended for scenarios where all of
	the following apply:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The recipient of the SET is capable of making outbound HTTP requests.</li>
        <li>
	    The transmitter is capable of hosting a TLS-enabled HTTP endpoint that is accessible
	    to the recipient.
	  </li>
        <li>
	    The transmitter and recipient are willing to exchange data with one another.
	  </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
	In some scenarios, either push-based or poll-based delivery could be used,
	and in others, only one of them would be applicable.
      </t>
      <t>
	A mechanism for exchanging configuration metadata such as endpoint URLs,
	cryptographic keys,
	and possible implementation constraints such as buffer size limitations
	between the transmitter and recipient is
        out of scope for this specification.  How SETs are defined and the process
        by which security events are identified for SET Recipients are specified in
	<xref target="RFC8417" format="default"/>.

      <name>SET Delivery</name>
      <t>
	When a SET is available for a SET Recipient, the SET Transmitter
	queues the SET in a buffer so that
	a SET Recipient can poll for SETs using HTTP POST.
      </t>
      <t>
	In poll-based SET delivery using HTTP over TLS, zero or more SETs are
        delivered in a JSON <xref target="RFC8259" format="default"/> document
        to a SET Recipient in response to an HTTP POST request to the
        SET Transmitter. Then in a following request, the SET Recipient
        acknowledges received SETs and can poll for more.  All requests and
        responses are JSON documents and use a
        <tt>Content-Type</tt> of
        <tt>application/json</tt>, as described in
        <xref target="pollReq" format="default"/>.
      </t>

      <t>After successful (acknowledged) SET delivery, SET
      Transmitters are not required to retain or record SETs for
      retransmission. Once a SET is acknowledged, the SET Recipient <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be
      responsible for retention, if needed.
      Transmitters may also discard undelivered SETs under deployment-specific conditions,
      such as if they have not been polled for over too long a period of time
      or if an excessive amount of storage is needed to retain them.
      </t>
      <t>
	Upon receiving a SET, the SET Recipient reads the SET and validates
	it in the manner described in <xref
	target="RFC8935" sectionFormat="of" section="2"/>.
	The SET Recipient <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> acknowledge receipt to the SET Transmitter,
	and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> do so in a timely fashion, as described in <xref target="pollRequest" format="default"/>.
	The SET Recipient <bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14> use the event acknowledgement mechanism
        to report event errors other than those relating to the parsing and
        validation of the SET.
      </t>
      <section anchor="httpPoll" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Polling Delivery using HTTP</name>
        <t>This method allows a SET Recipient to use HTTP POST
	(<xref target="RFC7231" sectionFormat="of" section="4.3.3"/>) to acknowledge
	SETs and to check for and receive zero or more SETs. Requests
	<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be made at a periodic interval (short polling) or requests
	<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> wait, pending availability of new SETs using long polling,
	per <xref target="RFC6202" sectionFormat="of" section="2"/>.
	Note that short polling will result in retrieving zero or more SETs
	whereas long polling will typically result in retrieving one or more SETs
	unless a timeout occurs.
        </t>
        <t>The delivery of SETs in this method is facilitated by HTTP
	POST requests initiated by the SET Recipient in which:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The SET Recipient makes a request for available SETs
        using an HTTP POST to a pre-arranged endpoint provided by the SET
        Transmitter, or</li>
          <li>after validating previously received SETs, the SET Recipient
        initiates another poll request using HTTP POST that includes
        acknowledgement of previous SETs and requests the next batch
        of SETs.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The purpose of the acknowledgement is to inform the
	SET Transmitter that delivery has succeeded and
	redelivery is no longer required.
	Before acknowledgement, SET Recipients validate the received SETs
	and retain them in a manner appropriate to the recipient's
	requirements. The level and method of retention of SETs
	by SET Recipients is out of scope of this specification.</t>

      <section anchor="pollReq" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Polling HTTP Request</name>
        <t>When initiating a poll request, the SET Recipient constructs
	a JSON document that consists of polling request parameters
	and SET acknowledgement parameters in the form of JSON objects.
        </t>
        <t>When making a request, the HTTP <tt>Content-Type</tt> header field

              <dd>An <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> integer value
	    indicating the maximum number of unacknowledged SETs to be returned.
	    The SET Transmitter <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> send more SETs than the specified maximum.
	    If more than the maximum number of SETs
	    are available, the SET Transmitter determines which to return first;
	    the oldest SETs available <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be returned first,
	    or another selection algorithm <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used,
	    such as prioritizing SETs in some manner that makes sense for the use case.
	    A value of <tt>0</tt> <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used by
	    SET Recipients that would like to perform an acknowledge-only
	    request. This enables the Recipient to use separate HTTP requests

      <t>
	Earlier versions of this specification made the use of TLS optional
	and described security and privacy considerations resulting from use
	of unencrypted HTTP as the underlying transport.
	When the working group decided to mandate usage of HTTP over TLS,
	it also decided to preserve the description of these considerations
	in a non-normative manner.
      </t>
      <t>
	The considerations for using unencrypted HTTP with this protocol
	are the same as those described in <xref
	target="RFC8935" sectionFormat="of"
	section="A"/>,
	and are therefore not repeated here.
