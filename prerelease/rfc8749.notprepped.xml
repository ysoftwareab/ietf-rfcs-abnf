      <t>This document retires DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) and reclassifies
RFCs 4431 and 5074 as Historic. Furthermore, this document updates RFC 6698 by
excluding the DLV resource record from certificates and updates RFC 6840 by
excluding the DLV registries from the trust anchor selection.</t>

      <t>DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) was introduced to assist with the
      adoption of DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033" format="default"/> <xref
      target="RFC4034" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC4035"
      format="default"/> in a time when the root zone and many top-level
      domains (TLDs) were unsigned.
   DLV allowed entities with signed zones under an unsigned parent zone
   or entities with registrars that did not accept DS records to
   publish trust anchors outside of the normal DNS delegation chain.
The root zone was signed in July 2010, and as of May 2019,
      1389 out of 1531 TLDs have a secure delegation from the root; thus, DLV
      has served its purpose and can now retire.</t>

      <t>One could argue that DLV is still useful because there are still some unsigned
TLDs and entities under those zones that will not benefit from signing their zone.
However, keeping the DLV mechanism also has disadvantages:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>It reduces the pressure to get the parent zone signed.</li>
        <li>It reduces the pressure on registrars to accept DS records.</li>
        <li>It complicates validation code.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>In addition, not every validator actually implemented DLV (only BIND 9 and
Unbound), so even if an entity can use DLV to set up an alternate path to its
trust anchor, its effect is limited. Furthermore, there was one well-known DLV
registry (dlv.isc.org), which was deprecated (replaced with a signed
empty zone) on September 30, 2017. With the absence of a well-known DLV
registry service, it is unlikely that there is a real benefit for the protocol
on the Internet nowadays.</t>
      <t>One other possible reason to keep DLV is to distribute trust anchors
for private enterprises. There are no known uses of DLV for this.</t>
      <t>All things considered, it is probably not worth the effort of maintaining
the DLV mechanism.</t>

      <name>Moving DLV to Historic Status</name>
      <t>There are two RFCs that specify DLV:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
        <li>RFC 4431 <xref target="RFC4431" format="default"/> specifies the
	DLV resource record.</li> 
        <li>RFC 5074 <xref target="RFC5074" format="default"/> specifies the
	DLV mechanism for publishing trust 
anchors outside the DNS delegation chain and how validators can use them
to validate DNSSEC-signed data.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>This document moves both RFC 4431 <xref target="RFC4431"
      format="default"/> and RFC 5074 <xref target="RFC5074"
      format="default"/> to 
Historic status. This is a clear signal to implementers that the DLV
resource record and the DLV mechanism <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be implemented or deployed.</t>

        <t>The RFCs being moved to Historic status are referenced by a couple
of other RFCs. 
   The sections below describe the changes to those documents
   due to the DLV RFCs being reclassified as Historic.

            <blockquote>DNSSEC forms certificates (the binding of an identity to a key) by

            that when trust anchors come from different sources, a validator

            (both BIND 9 and Unbound have an option for a DLV trust anchor
            that can be used solely as a fallback).</t>

      <t> Once the DLV mechanism is retired, zones that rely on DLV for their
      validation will be treated as insecure.  The chance that this scenario
      actually occurs is very low, since no well-known DLV registry
      exists.</t>
