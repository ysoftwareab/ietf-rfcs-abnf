<t>
	For any unfamiliar or a priori ambiguous terminology 
	herein, see <xref target="terms" format="default"/>.
</t>
<section numbered="true" toc="default"> <name>Motivation and External Influences</name>
<t>
	Many considerations (especially safety and security) necessitate 
	Unmanned Aircraft System Remote Identification and tracking 
	(UAS RID).
</t>

<t>
	Unmanned Aircraft (UA) may be fixed-wing, rotary-wing (e.g., 
	helicopter), hybrid, balloon, rocket, etc. Small fixed-wing UA 
	typically have Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) capability; rotary-wing and
	hybrid UA typically have Vertical Take-Off and Landing 
	(VTOL) capability. UA may be single- or multi-engine. The most 
	common today are multicopters (rotary-wing, multi-engine). The 
	explosion in UAS was enabled by hobbyist development 
        of advanced flight stability algorithms for multicopters that enabled even
        inexperienced pilots to take off, fly to a location of interest,
        hover, and return to the takeoff location or land at a
	distance. UAS can be remotely piloted by a human (e.g., with a 
	joystick) or programmed to proceed from Global Navigation Satellite 
	System (GNSS) waypoint to waypoint in a weak form of autonomy; 
	stronger autonomy is coming. 
</t>
<t>
	Small UA are "low observable" as they:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" empty="false">
	<li>
		typically have small radar cross sections;
	</li>
	<li>
		make noise that is quite noticeable at short ranges but difficult to 
		detect at distances they can quickly close (500 meters in under 
		13 seconds by the fastest consumer mass-market drones available
		in early 2021);
	</li>
	<li>
		typically fly at low altitudes (e.g.,  
		under 400 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) for UA to which RID applies in the US, as 
		per <xref target="Part107" format="default"/>); and
	</li>
	<li>
		are highly maneuverable and thus can fly under trees and between
		buildings.
	</li>
</ul>
<t>
	UA can carry payloads (including sensors, cyber weapons, and kinetic weapons)
	or can be used themselves as weapons by flying them into targets. 
	They can be flown by clueless, careless, or criminal operators. 
	Thus, the most basic function of UAS RID is "Identification Friend 
	or Foe (IFF)" to mitigate the significant threat they present.
</t>
<t> 
        Diverse other applications can be enabled or facilitated by RID.
        Internet protocols typically start out with at least one entity
        already knowing an identifier or locator of another; but an entity 
	(e.g., UAS or Observer device) encountering an a priori
	unknown UA in physical space has no identifier or logical space 
	locator for that UA, unless and until one is provided somehow. RID 
	provides an identifier, which, if well chosen, can facilitate use 
	of a variety of Internet family protocols and services to support 
	arbitrary applications beyond the basic security functions of RID. 
	For most of these, some type of identifier is essential, e.g., 
	Network Access Identifier (NAI), Digital Object Identifier (DOI), 
	Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), domain name, or public key. DRIP 
	motivations include both the basic security and the broader 
	application support functions of RID. The general scenario is 
	illustrated in <xref target="Scenario" format="default"/>.

<t>
	<xref target="Scenario" format="default"/> illustrates a typical 
	case where there may be the following: 
</t>
<ul>
     <li> multiple Observers, some of them members of the general public
      and others government officers with public safety and security
      responsibilities,</li>

     <li> multiple UA in flight within observation range, each with its own
       pilot/operator,</li>

     <li> at least one registry each for lookup of public and (by authorized
       parties only) private information regarding the UAS and their
       pilots/operators, and</li>

     <li> in the DRIP vision, DNS resolving various identifiers and locators
       of the entities involved.</li> 
</ul>
<t>	
	Note the absence of any links to/from the UA in the figure; this is 
	because UAS RID and other connectivity involving the UA varies. 
	Some connectivity paths do or do not exist depending upon the 
	scenario. Command and Control (C2) from the Ground Control Station (GCS) to the UA via the 
	Internet (e.g., using LTE cellular) is expected to become much more 
	common as Beyond Visual Line Of Sight (BVLOS) operations increase; 
	in such a case, there is typically not also a direct wireless link 
	between the GCS and UA. Conversely, if C2 is running over a direct 
	wireless link, then the GCS typically has Internet 
	connectivity, but the UA does not. Further, paths that nominally exist, such as between 
	an Observer device and the Internet, may be severely intermittent. 
	These connectivity constraints are likely to have an impact, e.g., 
	on how reliably DRIP requirements can be satisfied. 
</t>
<t>
	An Observer of UA may need to classify them, as illustrated 
	notionally in <xref target="Classification" format="default"/>, for 
	basic airspace Situational Awareness (SA). 
   An Observer can classify a UAS as one of the following and treat as:
</t>
<ul>
   <li> Taskable: can ask it to do something useful.</li>

   <li> Low Concern: can reasonably assume it is not
     malicious and would cooperate with requests to modify its flight
     plans for safety concerns that arise.</li>

   <li> High Concern or Unidentified: can focus surveillance on it.</li>
</ul>

<t>
	The widely cited "Standard Specification for Remote ID and Tracking" <xref
        target="F3411-19" format="default"/> was developed by ASTM International, Technical Committee F38 (UAS), Subcommittee F38.02
	(Aircraft Operations), Work Item WK65041. 
        The published standard is
	available for purchase from ASTM and is also available as an ASTM membership premium;
	early draft versions are freely available as Open Drone ID specifications
	<xref target="OpenDroneID" format="default"/>. <xref target="F3411-19"
	format="default"/> is frequently referenced in DRIP, where building
	upon its link layers and both enhancing support for and expanding the
	scope of its applications are central foci.
</t>
<t>
	In many applications, including UAS RID, identification and 
	identifiers are not ends in themselves; they exist to enable 
	lookups and provision of other services.
</t>

<t>
	Using UAS RID to facilitate vehicular (i.e., Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)) communications and 
	applications such as Detect And Avoid (DAA), which would impose 
	tighter latency bounds than RID itself, is an obvious possibility; this is
	explicitly contemplated in the "Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft"
	rule of the US Federal Aviation 
	Administration (FAA) <xref target="FRUR" format="default"/>. However, usage of RID 
	systems and information beyond mere identification (primarily to 
	hold operators accountable after the fact), including DAA, were
	declared out of scope in ASTM F38.02 WK65041, based on a 
	distinction between RID as a security standard versus DAA as a safety 
	application. Standards Development Organizations 
	(SDOs) in the aviation community generally set a higher bar for safety than for security, 
	especially with respect to reliability. Each SDO has its own 
	cultural set of connotations of safety versus security; the denotative 
	definitions of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
	are cited in <xref target="terms" format="default"/>.
</t>

<t>
	<xref target="Opinion1" format="default"/> and <xref target="WG105" 
	format="default"/> cite the Direct Remote Identification (DRI) 
	previously required and specified, explicitly stating that whereas 
	DRI is primarily for security purposes, the "Network Identification 
	Service" <xref target="Opinion1" format="default"/> (in the context 
	of U-space <xref target="InitialView" format="default"/>) or 
	"Electronic Identification" <xref target="WG105" format="default"/> 
	is primarily for safety purposes (e.g., Air Traffic Management, 
	especially hazards deconfliction) and also is allowed to be used 
	for other purposes such as support of efficient operations. These 
	emerging standards allow the security- and safety-oriented systems 
	to be separate or merged. In addition to mandating both Broadcast 
	and Network RID one-way to Observers, they will use Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) to other UAS 
	(also likely to and/or from some manned aircraft). These reflect 
	the broad scope of the European Union (EU) U-space concept, as 
	being developed in the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) 
	Joint Undertaking, the U-space architectural principles of which 
	are outlined in <xref target="InitialView" format="default"/>.
</t>

<t>
	ASD-STAN is an Associated Body to CEN (European Committee for 
	Standardization) for Aerospace Standards. It has published an EU 
	standard titled "Aerospace series - Unmanned Aircraft Systems - Part 002: 
	Direct Remote Identification" <xref target="ASDSTAN4709-002" format="default"/>;
	a current (early 2021) informal overview is freely 
	available in <xref target="ASDRI" format="default"/> (note that <xref target="ASDRI" format="default"/> may not precisely reflect the final standard as it was published before <xref target="ASDSTAN4709-002" format="default"/>). It will 
	provide compliance to cover the identical DRI requirements 
	applicable to drones of the following classes:
</t>
<ul>
   <li>C1 (<xref target="Delegated" format="default"/>, Part 2) </li>
   <li>C2 (<xref target="Delegated" format="default"/>, Part 3) </li>
   <li>C3 (<xref target="Delegated" format="default"/>, Part 4) </li>
   <li>C5 (<xref target="Amended" format="default"/>, Part 16) </li>
   <li>C6 (<xref target="Amended" format="default"/>, Part 17) </li>
</ul>
<t>
	The standard contemplated in <xref target="ASDRI" 
	format="default"/> will provide UA capability to be identified in 
	real time during the whole duration of the flight, without specific 
	connectivity or ground infrastructure link, utilizing existing 
	mobile devices within broadcast range. It will use Bluetooth 4, 
	Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN) (also known 
	as "Wi-Fi Aware" <xref target="WiFiNAN" format="default"/>), and/or 
	IEEE 802.11 Beacon modes. The emphasis of the EU standard is 
	compatibility with <xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/>, 
	although there are differences in mandatory and optional message 
	types and fields.
</t>
<t>
	The DRI system contemplated in <xref target="ASDRI" format="default"/>
	will broadcast the following locally:
</t>
<ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	<li>
		the UAS operator registration number;
	</li>
	<li>
		the <xref target="CTA2063A" format="default"/>-compliant unique 
		serial number of the UA;
	</li>
	<li>
		a time stamp, the geographical position of the UA, and its 
		height AGL or above its takeoff point;
	</li>
	<li>
		the UA ground speed and route course measured clockwise from 
		true north;
	</li>
	<li>
		the geographical position of the Remote Pilot, or if that is 
		not available, the geographical position of the UA takeoff 
		point; and
	</li>
	<li>
		for classes C1, C2, C3, the UAS emergency status.
	</li>
</ol>
<t>
	Under the 
	standard contemplated in <xref target="ASDRI" format="default"/>, data will be sent in plaintext, and the UAS operator 
	registration number will be represented as a 16-byte string 
	including the (European) state code. The corresponding private ID 
	part will contain three characters that are not broadcast but used by 
	authorities to access regional registration databases for 
	verification.
</t>

<t>
	ASD-STAN also contemplates corresponding Network Remote Identification
	(NRI) functionality.  ASD-STAN plans to revise their current standard
	with additional functionality (e.g., DRIP) to be published no later
	than 2022 <xref target="ASDRI" format="default"/>.
</t>
<t>
	Security-oriented UAS RID essentially has two goals: 1) enable the 
	general public to obtain and record an opaque ID for any observed 
	UA, which they can then report to authorities and 2) enable 
	authorities, from such an ID, to look up information about the UAS 
	and its operator. Safety-oriented UAS RID has stronger 
	requirements.
</t>
<t>
	Dynamic establishment of secure communications between the Observer
	and the UAS pilot seems to have been contemplated by the FAA UAS ID
	and Tracking Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC) in <xref
	target="Recommendations" format="default"/>; however, aside from DRIP,
	it is not addressed in any of the subsequent regulations or
	international SDO technical specifications known to the authors as of
	early 2021.
</t>
</section>
<section numbered="true" toc="default"> <name>Concerns and Constraints</name>
<t> 
	Disambiguation of multiple UA flying in close proximity may be very 
	challenging, even if each is reporting its identity, position, and 
	velocity as accurately as it can.
</t>
<t>
	The origin of information in UAS RID and UAS Traffic Management 
	(UTM) generally is the UAS or its operator. Self-reports may be 
	initiated by the Remote Pilot at the console of the GCS (the UAS subsystem used to remotely operate the UA) 
	or automatically by GCS software; in Broadcast RID, they are typically 
	initiated automatically by a process on the UA. Data in 
	the reports may come from sensors available to the operator (e.g., 
	radar or cameras), the GCS (e.g., "dead reckoning" UA location, 
	starting from the takeoff location and estimating the displacements 
	due to subsequent piloting commands, wind, etc.), or the UA itself 
	(e.g., an on-board GNSS receiver). In Broadcast RID, all the data 
	must be sent proximately by the UA, and most of the data ultimately comes
	from the UA. Whether information comes proximately from the 
	operator or from automated systems configured by the operator, 
	there are possibilities of unintentional error in and
	intentional falsification of this data.
	Mandating UAS RID, 
	specifying data elements required to be sent, monitoring compliance,
	and enforcing compliance (or penalizing non-compliance) are matters for 
	Civil Aviation Authorities (CAAs) and potentially other authorities. Specifying message 
	formats and supporting technologies to carry those data elements has been addressed by 
	other SDOs. Offering technical means, as extensions to external 
	standards, to facilitate verifiable compliance and 
	enforcement/monitoring is an opportunity for DRIP.
</t>
<t>
	Minimal specified information must be made available to the public. 
	Access to other data, e.g., UAS operator Personally Identifiable 
	Information (PII), must be limited to strongly authenticated 
	personnel, properly authorized in accordance with applicable 
	policy. The balance between privacy and transparency remains a 
	subject for public debate and regulatory action; DRIP can only 
	offer tools to expand the achievable trade space and enable 
	trade-offs within that space. <xref target="F3411-19" 
	format="default"/>, the basis for most current (2021) thinking 
	about and efforts to provide UAS RID, specifies only how to get the 
	UAS ID to the Observer: how the Observer can perform these lookups 
	and how the registries first can be populated with information are 
	not specified therein.
</t>


<t>
	The need for nearly universal deployment of UAS RID is pressing: 
	consider how negligible the value of an automobile license plate 
	system would be if only 90% of the cars displayed plates. This 
	implies the need to support use by Observers of already-ubiquitous 
	mobile devices (typically smartphones and tablets). Anticipating 
        CAA requirements to support legacy devices, especially in light of
        <xref target="Recommendations" format="default"/>, <xref 
        target="F3411-19" format="default"/> specifies that any UAS sending
        Broadcast RID over Bluetooth must do so over Bluetooth 4, 
        regardless of whether it also does so over newer versions. As UAS 
        sender devices and Observer receiver devices are unpaired, this 
        unpaired state requires use of the extremely short BT4 "advertisement" 
        (beacon) frames. 
</t>
<t>
	Wireless data links to or from UA are challenging. Flight is often 
	amidst structures and foliage at low altitudes over varied terrain. 
	UA are constrained in both total energy and instantaneous power by 
	their batteries. Small UA imply small antennas. Densely populated 
	volumes will suffer from link congestion: even if UA in an airspace 
	volume are few, other transmitters nearby on the ground, sharing 
	the same license free spectral band, may be many. Thus, air-to-air 
	and air-to-ground links will generally be slow and unreliable.
</t>
<t>
	UAS Cost, Size, Weight, and Power (CSWaP) constraints are severe. 
	CSWaP is a burden not only on the designers of new UAS for sale
	but also on owners of existing UAS that must be retrofit. Radio 
	Controlled (RC) aircraft modelers, "hams" who use licensed amateur 
	radio frequencies to control UAS, drone hobbyists, and others who 
	custom build UAS all need means of participating in UAS RID
	that are sensitive to both generic CSWaP and application-specific 
	considerations.
</t>
<t>
  To accommodate the most severely constrained cases, all of the concerns described above
  conspire to motivate system design decisions that complicate the
  protocol design problem.
</t>
<t>	
	Broadcast RID uses one-way local data links. UAS may have Internet 
	connectivity only intermittently, or not at all, during flight.
</t>
<t>
	Internet-disconnected operation of Observer devices has been deemed 
	by ASTM F38.02 as too infrequent to address. However, the preamble to 
	<xref target="FRUR" format="default"/> cites "remote and rural 
	areas that do not have reliable Internet access" as a major reason 
	for requiring Broadcast rather than Network RID. <xref target="FRUR" format="default"/> also states:</t>
	<blockquote>
	Personal wireless devices that are capable of receiving 47 CFR 
	part 15 frequencies, such as smart phones, tablets, or other 
	similar commercially available devices, will be able to receive 
	broadcast remote identification information directly without 
	reliance on an Internet connection.
        </blockquote>
	<t>Internet-disconnected 
	operation presents challenges, e.g., for Observers needing access 
	to the <xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> web-based 
	Broadcast Authentication Verifier Service or needing to do external 
	lookups.
</t>
<t>
	As RID must often operate within these constraints, heavyweight 
	cryptographic security protocols or even simple cryptographic 
	handshakes are infeasible, yet trustworthiness of UAS RID 
	information is essential. Under <xref target="F3411-19" 
	format="default"/>, <em>even the most basic datum, the UAS ID 
	itself, can be merely an unsubstantiated claim</em>.
</t>

<t>
	Observer devices are ubiquitous; thus, they are popular targets for malware 
	or other compromise, so they cannot be generally trusted (although the user 
	of each device is compelled to trust that device, to some extent).
	A "fair witness" functionality (inspired by <xref target="Stranger"

	Despite work by regulators and SDOs, there are substantial gaps in 
	UAS standards generally and UAS RID specifically. <xref

	ongoing standardization activities, and gaps (as of 2020); Section 
	7.8 catalogs those related specifically to UAS RID. DRIP will 
	address the most fundamental of these gaps, as foreshadowed above.

<section numbered="true" toc="default"> <name>DRIP Scope</name>

<t>
 DRIP's initial objective is to make RID immediately actionable,
 especially in emergencies, in severely constrained UAS environments
 (both Internet and local-only connected scenarios), balancing legitimate
 (e.g., public safety) authorities' Need To Know trustworthy information
 with UAS operators' privacy.
	The phrase
	"immediately actionable" means information of sufficient 
	precision, accuracy, and timeliness for an Observer to use it as 
	the basis for immediate decisive action (e.g., triggering
	a defensive counter-UAS system, attempting to initiate 
	communications with the UAS operator, accepting the presence of the 
	UAS in the airspace where/when observed as not requiring further 
	action, etc.) with potentially severe consequences of any 
	action or inaction chosen based on that information. For further 
	explanation of the concept of immediate actionability, see <xref 
	target="ENISACSIRT" format="default"/>.
</t>
<t>
	Note that UAS RID must achieve nearly universal adoption, but DRIP can
	add value even if only selectively deployed. Authorities with
	jurisdiction over more sensitive airspace volumes may set a RID
	requirement, for flight in such volumes, that is higher than generally
	mandated.  Those with a greater need for high-confidence IFF can equip
	with DRIP, enabling strong authentication of their own aircraft and
	allied operators without regard for the weaker (if any) authentication
	of others.
</t>
<t>	
	DRIP (originally "Trustworthy Multipurpose Remote Identification
	(TM-RID)") could be applied to verifiably identify other types of
	registered things reported to be in specified physical
	locations. Providing timely trustworthy identification data is also
	prerequisite to identity-oriented networking. Despite the value of
	DRIP to these and other potential applications, UAS RID is the urgent
	motivation and clear initial focus of DRIP. Existing Internet
	resources (protocol standards, services, infrastructure, and business
	models) should be leveraged.

  This section defines a non-comprehensive set of terms expected to be
  used in DRIP documents.  This list is meant to be the DRIP
  terminology reference; as such, some of the terms listed below are
  not used in this document.
</t>
<t>
  To encourage comprehension necessary for adoption of DRIP by the
  intended user community, the UAS community's norms are respected
  herein, and definitions are quoted in cases where they have been
  found in that community's documents.  Most of the terms listed
  below are from that community (even if specific source documents
  are not cited); any terms that are DRIP-specific or defined by
  this document are marked "(DRIP)".
</t>
<t>
  Note that, in the UAS community, the plural form of an acronym,
  generally, is the same as the singular form, e.g., Unmanned Aircraft
  System (singular) and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (plural) are both
  represented as UAS.

<section numbered="true" toc="default"> <name>UAS RID Problem Space</name>
<t>
	CAAs worldwide are mandating UAS RID. The European Union Aviation 
	Safety Agency (EASA) has published <xref target="Delegated" 
	format="default"/> and <xref target="Implementing" 
	format="default"/> regulations. The US FAA has published a "final" 
	rule <xref target="FRUR" format="default"/> and has described the 
	key role that UAS RID plays in UAS Traffic Management
   (UTM) in 
	<xref target="FAACONOPS" format="default"/> (especially Section 
	2.6). At the time of writing, CAAs promulgate performance-based 
	regulations that do not specify techniques but rather cite 
	industry consensus technical standards as acceptable means of 
	compliance.
</t>	
<t>  
	The most widely cited such industry consensus technical standard
	for UAS RID is <xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/>, which 
	defines two means of UAS RID:
</t>

<ul spacing="normal">
	<li>
		Network RID defines a set of information for UAS to make 
		available globally indirectly via the Internet, through servers 
		that can be queried by Observers.
	</li>
	<li>
		Broadcast RID defines a set of messages for UA to transmit 
		locally directly one-way over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi (without IP or 
		any other protocols between the data link and application 
		layers), to be received in real time by local Observers.
	</li>
</ul>


<t>
	UAS using both means must send the same UAS RID application-layer 
	information via each <xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/>.
	The presentation may differ, as Network RID defines a data 
	dictionary, whereas Broadcast RID defines message formats (which 
	carry items from that same data dictionary). The interval (or rate) 
	at which it is sent may differ, as Network RID can accommodate 
	Observer queries asynchronous to UAS updates (which generally need 
	be sent only when information, such as location, changes), whereas 
	Broadcast RID depends upon Observers receiving UA messages at the 
	time they are transmitted.
</t>

<t>	
	Network RID depends upon Internet connectivity in several segments 
	from the UAS to each Observer.
  Broadcast RID should need Internet
  (or other Wide Area Network) connectivity only to retrieve registry 
  information, using, as the primary unique key for database lookup, 
  the UAS
   Identifier (UAS ID) that was directly locally received.	
	Broadcast RID does not assume IP connectivity of UAS; messages are 
	encapsulated by the UA <em>without IP</em>, directly in link-layer 
	frames (Bluetooth 4, Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi NAN, IEEE 802.11 Beacon, or 
	perhaps others in the future).
</t>


<t anchor="IDtypes">
	<xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> specifies three ID 
	Type values, and its proposed revision (at the time of writing) adds 
	a fourth:
</t>

<ol spacing="normal" type="%d" group="type">
	<li>
		A static, manufacturer-assigned, hardware serial number as 
		defined in "Small Unmanned Aerial Systems Serial 
		Numbers" <xref target="CTA2063A" format="default"/>.
	</li>
	<li>
		A CAA-assigned (generally static) ID, like the registration 
		number of a manned aircraft.
	</li>
	<li>
		A UTM-system-assigned Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) <xref target="RFC4122" 
		format="default"/>, which can but need not be dynamic.
	</li>
	<li>
		A Specific Session ID, of any of an 8-bit range of subtypes 
		defined external to ASTM and registered with ICAO, for which 
		subtype 1 has been reserved by ASTM for the DRIP entity ID.
	</li>

</ol>

<t>
	Per <xref target="Delegated" format="default"/>, the EU allows only 
	ID Type 1. Under <xref target="FRUR" format="default"/>, the US 
	allows ID Type 1 and ID Type 3. <xref target="NPRM" format="default"/> 
	proposed that a "Session ID" would be "e.g., a 
	randomly-generated alphanumeric code assigned by a Remote ID UAS 
	Service Supplier (USS) on a per-flight basis designed to provide 
	additional privacy to the operator", but given the omission of 
	Network RID from <xref target="FRUR" format="default"/>, how this 
	is to be assigned in the US is still to be determined.
</t>
<t>
	As yet, there are apparently no CAA public proposals to use ID 
	Type 2. In the preamble of <xref target="FRUR" format="default"/>, 
	the FAA argues that registration numbers should not be sent in RID, 
	insists that the capability of looking up registration numbers from 
	information contained in RID should be restricted to FAA and other 
	Government agencies, and implies that Session ID would be linked to 
	the registration number only indirectly via the serial number in 
	the registration database. The possibility of cryptographically 
	blinding registration numbers, such that they can be revealed under 
	specified circumstances, does not appear to be mentioned in 
	applicable regulations or external technical standards.
</t>
<t>
	Per <xref target="Delegated" format="default"/>, the EU also 
	requires an operator registration number (an additional identifier 
	distinct from the UAS ID) that can be carried in an <xref 
	target="F3411-19" format="default"/> optional Operator ID Message.
</t>

<t>
	<xref target="FRUR" format="default"/> allows RID requirements to 
	be met either by the UA itself, which is then designated a 
	"standard remote identification unmanned aircraft", or by an add-on 
	"remote identification broadcast module".

  The requirements for a module are different than for a standard RID UA. The
  module:
</t>

<ul>
  <li>must transmit its own serial number (neither the serial number of the UA
  to which it is attached, nor a Session ID),</li>
  <li>must transmit takeoff location as a proxy for the location of the
  pilot/GCS,</li>
  <li>need not transmit UA emergency status, and</li>
  <li>is allowed to be used only for operations within VLOS of the Remote
  Pilot.</li>
</ul>

<t>
	Jurisdictions may relax or waive RID requirements for certain 
	operators and/or under certain conditions. For example, <xref 
	target="FRUR" format="default"/> allows operators with UAS not 
	equipped for RID to conduct VLOS operations at counterintuitively 
	named "FAA-Recognized Identification Areas (FRIAs)"; radio-controlled model aircraft flying clubs and other eligible 
	organizations can apply to the FAA for such recognition of their 
	operating areas.
</t>
<section numbered="true" toc="default"> <name>Network RID</name>


<t>
  <xref target="NetRID" format="default"/> illustrates Network RID 
	information flows. Only two of the three typically wireless links 
	shown involving the UAS (UA-GCS, UA-Internet, and GCS-Internet) 
	need exist to support C2 and Network RID. All three may exist, at 
	the same or different times, especially in BVLOS operations. There 
	must be at least one information flow path (direct or indirect) between the 
	GCS and the UA, for the former to exercise C2 over the latter. If 
	this path is two-way (as increasingly it is, even for inexpensive small
	UAS), the UA will also send its status (and position, if 
	suitably equipped, e.g., with GNSS) to the GCS. There also must be 
	a path between at least one subsystem of the UAS (UA or GCS) and 
	the Internet, for the former to send status and position updates to 
	its USS (serving inter alia as a Net-RID SP).

<t>
	Direct UA-Internet wireless links are expected to become more 
	common, especially on larger UAS, but, at the time of writing, they are rare. 
	Instead, the RID data flow typically originates on the UA and 
	passes through the GCS, or it originates on the GCS. Network RID data 
	makes three trips through the Internet (GCS-SP, SP-DP, DP-Observer, 
	unless any of them are colocated), implying use of IP (and other 
	middle-layer protocols, e.g., TLS/TCP or DTLS/UDP) on those trips. 
	IP is not necessarily used or supported on the UA-GCS link (if 
	indeed that direct link exists, as it typically does now, but in 
	BVLOS operations often will not).
</t>
<t>
	Network RID is publish-subscribe-query. In the UTM context:
</t>
<ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	<li>
		The UAS operator pushes an "operational intent" (the current 
		term in UTM corresponding to a flight plan in manned aviation) 
		to the USS (call it USS#1) that will serve that UAS (call it 
		UAS#1) for that operation, primarily to enable deconfliction 
		with other operations potentially impinging upon that 
		operation's 4-D airspace volume (call it Volume#1).
	</li>
	<li> 
		Assuming the operation is approved and commences, UAS#1 
		periodically pushes location/status updates to USS#1, which 
		serves inter alia as the Network RID Service Provider 
		(Net-RID SP) for that operation.
	</li>
	<li>
		When users of any other USS (whether they be other UAS 
		operators or Observers) develop an interest in any 4-D airspace 
		volume (e.g., because they wish to submit an operational intent 
		or because they have observed a UA), they query their own USS 
		on the volumes in which they are interested.
	</li>

	<li>
		Their USS query, via the UTM
		Discovery and Synchronization
       Service (DSS), all other USS in the UTM system and learn of 
		any USS that have operations in those volumes (including any 
		volumes intersecting them); thus, those USS whose query volumes 
		intersect Volume#1 (call them USS#2 through USS#n) learn that 
		USS#1 has such operations.
	</li>
	<li> 
		Interested parties can then subscribe to track updates on that 
		operation of UAS#1, via their own USS, which serve as
		Network RID
       Display Providers (Net-RID DPs) for that operation.
	</li>
	<li> 
		USS#1 (as Net-RID SP) will then publish updates of UAS#1 status 
		and position to all other subscribed USS in USS#2 through USS#n 
		(as Net-RID DP).
	</li>

	<li>
		All Net-RID DP subscribed to that operation of UAS#1 will 
		deliver its track information to their users who subscribed to 
		that operation of UAS#1 (via means unspecified by <xref 
		target="F3411-19" format="default"/>, etc., but generally 
		presumed to be web browser based).
	</li> 
</ol>
<t>
	Network RID has several connectivity scenarios:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal">


  <li>
		<em>Persistently Internet-connected UA</em> can consistently
		directly source RID information; this requires wireless 
		coverage throughout the intended operational airspace volume, 
		plus a buffer (e.g., winds may drive the UA out of the volume). 
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Intermittently Internet-connected UA</em>, can usually 
		directly source RID information, but when offline (e.g., due to 
		signal blockage by a large structure being inspected using the 
		UAS), need the GCS to proxy source RID information.
	</li>

	<li>
		<em>Indirectly connected UA</em> lack the ability to send IP 
		packets that will be forwarded into and across the Internet 
		but instead have some other form of communications to another 
		node that can relay or proxy RID information to the Internet; 
		typically, this node would be the GCS (which to perform its 
		function must know where the UA is, although C2 link outages do 
		occur).
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Non-connected UA</em> have no means of sourcing RID 
		information, in which case the GCS or some other interface 
		available to the operator must source it. In the extreme case, 
		this could be the pilot or other agent of the operator using a 
		web browser or application to designate, to a USS or other UTM 
		entity, a time-bounded airspace volume in which an operation 
		will be conducted. This is referred to as a "non-equipped 
		network participant" engaging in "area operations". This may 
		impede disambiguation of ID if multiple UAS operate in the same 
		or overlapping 4-D volumes. In most airspace volumes, most 
		classes of UA will not be permitted to fly if non-connected.
	</li>
</ul>

<t>
	In most cases in the near term (2021), the Network RID first-hop 
	data link is likely to be either cellular (which can also support BVLOS C2 
	over existing large coverage areas) or Wi-Fi (which can also 
	support Broadcast RID). However, provided the data link can support 
	at least UDP/IP and ideally also TCP/IP, its type is generally 
	immaterial to higher-layer protocols. The UAS, as the ultimate 
	source of Network RID information, feeds a Net-RID SP (typically 
	the USS to which the UAS operator subscribes), which proxies for 
	the UAS and other data sources. An Observer or other ultimate 
	consumer of Network RID information obtains it from a Net-RID DP 
	(also typically a USS), which aggregates information from multiple 
	Net-RID SPs to offer airspace Situational Awareness (SA) coverage 
	of a volume of interest. Network RID Service and Display Providers 
	are expected to be implemented as servers in well-connected 
	infrastructure, communicating with each other via the Internet and 
	accessible by Observers via means such as web Application 
	Programming Interfaces (APIs) and browsers.
</t>
<t>
	Network RID is the less constrained of the defined means of UAS RID. 
	<xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> only specifies information exchanges from Net-RID 
	SP to Net-RID DP. It is presumed that IETF 
	efforts supporting the more constrained Broadcast RID (see next 
	section) can be generalized for Network RID and potentially also 
	for UAS-to-USS or other UTM communications.
</t>

<section anchor="broadcast-rid" numbered="true" toc="default"> <name>Broadcast RID</name>

<t>
	<xref target="B-RID" format="default"/> illustrates the Broadcast RID 
	information flow. Note the absence of the Internet from the figure. 
	This is because Broadcast RID is one-way direct transmission of 
	application-layer messages over an RF data link (without IP) from 
	the UA to local Observer devices. Internet connectivity is involved 
	only in what the Observer chooses to do with the information 
	received, such as verify signatures using a web-based Broadcast 
	Authentication Verifier Service and look up information in 
	registries using the UAS ID as the primary unique key.

<t>
	Broadcast RID is conceptually similar to
	Automatic Dependent
   Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B). However, for various technical 
	and other reasons, regulators including the EASA have not indicated 
	intent to allow, and FAA has explicitly prohibited, use of ADS-B 
	for UAS RID.
</t>

<t>
	<xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> specifies four Broadcast 
	RID data links: Bluetooth 4.x, Bluetooth 5.x with Extended 
	Advertisements and Long-Range Coded PHY (S=8), Wi-Fi NAN at 2.4 
	GHz, and Wi-Fi NAN at 5 GHz. A UA must broadcast (using 
	advertisement mechanisms where no other option supports broadcast) 
	on at least one of these. If sending on Bluetooth 5.x, it is 
	required to do so concurrently on 4.x (referred to in <xref 
	target="F3411-19" format="default"/> as "Bluetooth Legacy"); current 
	(2021) discussions in ASTM F38.02 on revising <xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/>, 
	motivated by drafts of European standards, suggest that both Bluetooth 
	versions will be required. If broadcasting Wi-Fi NAN at 5 GHz, it 
	is required to do so concurrently at 2.4 GHz; current 
	discussions in ASTM F38.02 include relaxing this. Wi-Fi Beacons are also 
	under consideration. Future revisions of <xref target="F3411-19" 
	format="default"/> may allow other data links.
</t>
<t>
	The selection of Broadcast RID media was driven by research into 
	what is commonly available on "ground" units (smartphones and 
	tablets) and what was found as prevalent or "affordable" in UA. 
	Further, there must be an API for the Observer's receiving 
	application to have access to these messages. As yet, only Bluetooth 
	4.x support is readily available; thus, the current focus is on 
	working within the 31-byte payload limit of the Bluetooth 4.x 
	"Broadcast Frame" transmitted as an "advertisement" on beacon 
	channels. After overheads, this limits the RID message to 25 bytes 
	and the UAS ID string to a maximum length of 20 bytes.
</t>

<t>
  A single Bluetooth 4.x advertisement frame can just barely fit any UAS ID long enough to 
be sufficiently unique for its purpose.</t>

  <t>
   There is related information, which especially includes, but is not limited to,
   the UA position and velocity, which must be represented by data
   elements long enough to provide precision sufficient for their
   purpose while remaining unambiguous with respect to their reference
  frame.</t>
  <t>
   In order to enable Observer devices to verify that 1) the claimed UAS ID is indeed owned by the sender 
and 2) the related information was indeed sent by the owner of that same UAS ID, authentication data elements 
would typically be lengthy with conventional cryptographic signature schemes.  They would be 
too long to fit in a single frame, even with the latest schemes currently being standardized.</t>

<t>
Thus, it is infeasible to bundle information related to the UAS ID and corresponding        
authentication data elements in a single Bluetooth 4.x frame; yet, somehow all these must   
be securely bound together.</t>

<t> 
  Messages that cannot be encapsulated in a
   single frame (thus far, only the Authentication Message) must be segmented
   into message "pages" (in the terminology of <xref target="F3411-19"
   format="default"/>). Message pages must somehow be correlated as belonging
   to the same message. Messages carrying position, velocity and other data
   must somehow be correlated with the Basic ID Message that carries the UAS
   ID.
   This correlation is expected to be done on the basis of Media Access
   Control (MAC) address. This may be complicated by MAC address
   randomization. Not all the common devices expected to be used by Observers
   have APIs that make sender MAC addresses available to user space receiver
   applications. MAC addresses are easily spoofed.
   Data elements are not
   so detached on other media (see Message Pack in the paragraph after next).
</t>

<t>
	<xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> Broadcast RID specifies
	several message types (see Section 5.4.5 and Table 3 of <xref
	target="F3411-19" format="default"/>). The table below lists
	these message types. The 4-bit Message Type field in the header can
	index up to 16 types. Only seven are defined at the time of writing. Only two are
	mandatory. All others are optional, unless required by a
	jurisdictional authority, e.g., a CAA. To satisfy both EASA and FAA
	rules, all types are needed, except Self-ID and Authentication, as the
	data elements required by the rules are scattered across several
	message types (along with some data elements not required by the
	rules).
</t>
<t>
	The Message Pack (type 0xF) is not actually a message but the 
	framed concatenation of at most one message of each type of any 
	subset of the other types, in type index order. Some of the 
	messages that it can encapsulate are mandatory; others are optional. 
	The Message Pack itself is mandatory on data links that can 
	encapsulate it in a single frame (Bluetooth 5.x and Wi-Fi).

<t>
	<xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> Broadcast RID specifies 
	very few quantitative performance requirements: static information 
	must be transmitted at least once per three seconds, and dynamic 
	information (the Location/Vector Message) must be transmitted at 
	least once per second and be no older than one second when sent. 
	<xref target="FRUR" format="default"/> requires all information be 
	sent at least once per second.
</t>
<t>
	<xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> Broadcast RID transmits 
	all information as cleartext (ASCII or binary), so static IDs 
	enable trivial correlation of patterns of use, which is unacceptable in many 
	applications, e.g., package delivery routes of competitors.
</t>

<t>
	Any UA can assert any ID using the <xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> required Basic ID Message, which lacks any 
	provisions for verification. The Location/Vector Message likewise 
	lacks provisions for verification and does not contain the ID, so it
	must be correlated somehow with a Basic ID Message: the developers 
	of <xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> have suggested using 
	the MAC addresses on the Broadcast RID data link, but these may be 
	randomized by the operating system stack to avoid the adversarial 
	correlation problems of static identifiers.
</t>
<t>
	The <xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> optional 
	Authentication Message specifies framing for authentication data
	but does not specify any authentication method, and the maximum 
	length of the specified framing is too short for conventional 
	digital signatures and far too short for conventional certificates 
	(e.g., X.509). Fetching certificates via the Internet is not always 
	possible (e.g., Observers working in remote areas, such as national 
	forests), so devising a scheme whereby certificates can be 
	transported over Broadcast RID is necessary. The one-way nature of 
	Broadcast RID precludes challenge-response security protocols 
	(e.g., Observers sending nonces to UA, to be returned in signed 
	messages). Without DRIP extensions to  <xref target="F3411-19" 
	format="default"/>, an Observer would be seriously challenged to 
	validate the asserted UAS ID or any other information about the UAS 
	or its operator looked up therefrom.
</t>


<t>
	At the time of writing, the proposed revision of <xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> defines a new Authentication Type 5 ("Specific Authentication Method (SAM)")
        to enable 
	SDOs other than ASTM to define authentication payload formats. The 
	first byte of the payload is the SAM Type, used to demultiplex such 
	variant formats. All formats (aside from those for private experimental 
	use) must be registered with ICAO, which assigns the SAM Type. Any 
	Authentication Message payload that is to be sent in exactly the 
	same form over all currently specified Broadcast RID media is 
	limited by lower-layer constraints to a total length of 201 bytes. 
	For Authentication Type 5, which is expected to be used by DRIP, the SAM 
	Type byte consumes the first of these, limiting DRIP authentication 
	payload formats to a maximum of 200 bytes.
</t>
</section>
<section numbered="true" toc="default"> <name>USS in UTM and RID</name>
<t>

  
	UAS RID and UTM are complementary; Network RID is a UTM service. 
	The backbone of the UTM system is comprised of multiple USS: one or 
	several per jurisdiction with some being limited to a single jurisdiction while 
	others span multiple jurisdictions. USS also serve as the 
	principal, or perhaps the sole, interface for operators and UAS into 
	the UTM environment. Each operator subscribes to at least one USS. 
	Each UAS is registered by its operator in at least one USS. Each 
	operational intent is submitted to one USS; if approved, that UAS 
	and operator can commence that operation. During the operation, 
	status and location of that UAS must be reported to that USS, which, 
	in turn, provides information as needed about that operator, UAS, 
	and operation into the UTM system and to Observers via Network RID.
</t>
<t>
	USS provide services not limited to Network RID; indeed, the primary
	USS function is deconfliction of airspace usage between different UAS (and their
	operators). It will occasionally deconflict UAS from non-UAS operations, such as
	manned aircraft and rocket
	launch. Most deconfliction involving a given operation is hoped to be
	completed prior to commencing that operation; this is called "strategic
	deconfliction". If that fails, "tactical deconfliction" comes into
	play; AirBorne DAA (ABDAA) may not involve USS, but Ground-Based DAA (GBDAA)
	likely will.  Dynamic
	constraints, formerly called "UAS Volume Restrictions (UVRs)", can be
	necessitated by circumstances such as local emergencies and extreme weather, specified by
	authorities on the ground, and propagated in UTM.
</t>
<t>
	No role for USS in Broadcast RID is currently specified by 
	regulators or by <xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/>. However, 
	USS are likely to serve as registries (or perhaps registrars) for 
	UAS (and perhaps operators); if so, USS will have a role in all 
	forms of RID. Supplemental Data Service Providers (SDSPs) are also 
	likely to find roles, not only in UTM as such but also in enhancing 
	UAS RID and related services.
   RID services are used
   in concert with USS, SDSP, or other UTM entities (if and as needed and available). 
   Narrowly defined, RID services provide
   regulator-specified identification information; more broadly defined,
   RID services may leverage identification to facilitate related
   services or functions, likely beginning with V2X.
</t>

<t>
	In addition to the gaps described above, there is a fundamental gap 
	in almost all current or proposed regulations and technical 
	standards for UAS RID. As noted above, ID is not an end in itself,
	but a means. Protocols specified in <xref target="F3411-19" 
	format="default"/> etc. provide limited information potentially 
	enabling (but no technical means for) an Observer to communicate 
	with the pilot, e.g., to request further information on the UAS 
	operation or exit from an airspace volume in an emergency. The 
	System Message provides the location of the pilot/GCS, so an 
	Observer could physically go to the asserted location to look for 
	the Remote Pilot; this is slow, at best, and may not be feasible. 
	What if the pilot is on the opposite rim of a canyon, or there are 
	multiple UAS operators to contact whose GCS all lie in different 
	directions from the Observer? An Observer with Internet 
	connectivity and access privileges could look up operator PII in a 
	registry and then call a phone number in hopes that someone who can 
	immediately influence the UAS operation will answer promptly during 
	that operation; this is unreliable, at best, and may not be prudent. 
	Should pilots be encouraged to answer phone calls while flying? 
	Internet technologies can do much better than this.
</t>


<t>	
  Thus, to achieve widespread adoption of a RID system supporting safe and secure
  operation of UAS, protocols must do the following (despite the intrinsic tension among 
   these objectives):
</t>
<ul>
  <li>preserve operator privacy,</li>
  <li>enable strong authentication, and</li>
  <li>enable the immediate use of information by authorized parties.</li>
</ul>

<t>
	Just as <xref 
	target="F3411-19" format="default"/> is expected to be approved by 
	regulators as a basic means of compliance with UAS RID regulations, 
	DRIP is likewise expected to be approved to address further issues, 
	starting with the creation and registration of Session IDs.
</t>
<t>
	DRIP will focus on making information obtained via UAS RID 
	immediately usable:
</t>
<ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	<li>
		by making it trustworthy (despite the severe constraints 
		of Broadcast RID);
	</li>
	<li>
		by enabling verification that a UAS is registered for RID, and, 
		if so, in which registry (for classification of trusted 
		operators on the basis of known registry vetting, even by 
		Observers lacking Internet connectivity at observation time);
	</li>
	<li>
		by facilitating independent reports of UA aeronautical data 
		(location, velocity, etc.) to confirm or refute the operator 
		self-reports upon which UAS RID and UTM tracking are based;
	</li>
	<li>
		by enabling instant establishment, by authorized parties, 
		of secure communications with the Remote Pilot.
	</li>
</ol>
<t>
	The foregoing considerations, beyond those addressed by baseline 
	UAS RID standards such as <xref target="F3411-19" 
	format="default"/>, imply the requirements for DRIP detailed in <xref target="reqs"/>.
</t>
</section>
</section>
<section numbered="true" toc="default" anchor="reqs"> <name>Requirements</name>
<t>
	The following requirements apply to DRIP as a set of related 
	protocols, various subsets of which, in conjunction with other IETF 
	and external technical standards, may suffice to comply with the 
	regulations in any given jurisdiction or meet any given user need. 
	It is not intended that each and every protocol of the DRIP set, alone, satisfy 
	each and every requirement. To satisfy these requirements, Internet 
	connectivity is required some of the time (e.g., to support DRIP 
	Entity Identifier creation/registration) but not all of the time 
	(e.g., authentication of an asserted DRIP Entity Identifier can be 
	achieved by a fully working and provisioned Observer device even 
	when that device is off-line so is required at all times).

<t>
	Requirements imposed either by regulation or by <xref 
	target="F3411-19" format="default"/> are not reiterated in this document, but they
	drive many of the numbered requirements listed here. The regulatory performance requirement in <xref 
	target="FRUR" format="default"/>
	currently would be satisfied by ensuring information refresh rates 
	of at least 1 Hertz, with latencies no greater than 1 second, at 
	least 80% of the time, but these numbers may vary between 
	jurisdictions and over time. Instead, the DRIP QoS requirement is 
	that parameters such as performance and reliability be specifiable by user policy,
	which does not imply satisfiable in all cases but 
	does imply (especially together with the Management requirement) that 
	when specifications are not met, appropriate parties are notified.
</t>


<t>
	The Provable Ownership requirement addresses the possibility that the
	actual sender is not the claimed sender (i.e., is a spoofer).  DRIP
	could meet this requirement by, for example, verifying an asymmetric
	cryptographic signature using a sender-provided public key from which
	the asserted UAS ID can be at least partially derived.  The Provable
	Binding requirement addresses the problem with MAC address correlation
	<xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> noted in <xref
	target="broadcast-rid" format="default"/>. The Provable Registration
	requirement may impose burdens not only on the UAS sender and the
	Observer's receiver, but also on the registry; yet, it cannot depend
	upon the Observer being able to contact the registry at the time of
	observing the UA.  The Readability requirement pertains to the
	structure and format of information at endpoints rather than its
	encoding in transit, so it may involve machine-assisted format
	conversions (e.g., from binary encodings) and/or decryption (see <xref
	target="priv" format="default"/>).
</t>
<t>
	The Gateway requirement is in pursuit of three objectives: (1) 
	mark up a RID message with where and when it was actually received, 
	which may agree or disagree with the self-report in the set of 
	messages; (2) defend against replay attacks; and (3) support 
	optional SDSP services such as multilateration, to complement UAS 
	position self-reports with independent measurements. This is the 
	only instance in which DRIP transports <xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> messages; most of DRIP pertains to the 
	authentication of such messages and identifiers carried in them.
</t>
<t>
	The Contact requirement allows any party that learns a UAS ID 
	(that is a DRIP Entity Identifier rather than another ID Type) 
	to request establishment of a communications session with the 
	corresponding UAS RID sender and certain entities associated with 
	that UAS, but AAA and policy restrictions, inter alia on 
	resolving the identifier to any locators (typically IP addresses), 
	should prevent unauthorized parties from distracting or harassing 
	pilots. Thus, some but not all Observers of UA, receivers of 
	Broadcast RID, clients of Network RID, and other parties can 
	become successfully initiating endpoints for these sessions.
</t>
<t>
	The QoS requirement is only that performance and reliability 
	parameters can be <em>specified</em> by policy, not that any such 
	specifications must be guaranteed to be met; any failure to meet 
	such would be reported under the Management requirement. Examples 
	of such parameters are the maximum time interval at which messages 
	carrying required data elements may be transmitted, the maximum 
	tolerable rate of loss of such messages, and the maximum tolerable 
	latency between a dynamic data element (e.g., GNSS position of UA) 
	being provided to the DRIP sender and that element being delivered 
	by the DRIP receiver to an application.
</t>
<t>	
	The Mobility requirement refers to rapid geographic mobility of 
	nodes, changes of their points of attachment to networks, and 
	changes to their IP addresses; it is not limited to micro-mobility 
	within a small geographic area or single Internet access provider.

</section>
<section numbered="true" toc="default"> <name>Rationale</name>
<t>
	The DRIP identifier can refer to various entities. In the primary
	initial use case, the entity to be identified is the UA. Entities to
	be identified in other likely use cases include, but are not limited to,
	the operator, USS, and Observer. In all cases, the entity identified
	must own the identifier (i.e., have the exclusive capability to use
	the identifier, such that receivers can verify the entity's ownership
	of it).
</t>
<t>
	The DRIP identifier can be used at various layers. In Broadcast RID,
	it would be used by the application running directly over the data
	link. In Network RID, it would be used by the application running over
	HTTPS (not required by DRIP but generally used by Network RID
	implementations) and possibly other protocols. In RID-initiated V2X
	applications such as DAA and C2, it could be used between the network
	and transport layers (e.g., with the Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
	<xref target="RFC9063" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC7401"
	format="default"/>) or between the transport and application
	layers (e.g., with DTLS <xref
	target="RFC6347" format="default"/>).
</t>
<t>
	Registry ID (which registry the entity is in) and Entity ID (which 
	entity it is, within that registry) are requirements on a single 
	DRIP Entity Identifier, not separate (types of) ID. In the most 
	common use case, the entity will be the UA, and the DRIP identifier 
	will be the UAS ID; however, other entities may also benefit from 
	having DRIP identifiers, so the entity type is not prescribed here.
</t>


<t>
	Whether a UAS ID is generated by the operator, GCS, UA, USS, 
	registry, or some collaboration among them is unspecified; 
	however, there must be agreement on the UAS ID among these 
	entities. Management of DRIP identifiers is the primary function of 
	their registration hierarchies, from the root (presumably IANA), 
	through sector-specific and regional authorities (presumably ICAO 
	and CAAs), to the identified entities themselves.
</t>
<t>
	While Uniqueness might be considered an implicit requirement for 
	any identifier, here the point of the explicit requirement is not 
	just that it should be unique, but also where and when it should be 
	unique: global scope within a specified space, from registration to 
	deregistration.
</t>
<t>
	While Non-spoofability imposes requirements for and on a DRIP 
	authentication protocol, it also imposes requirements on the 
	properties of the identifier itself. An example of how the nature 
	of the identifier can support non-spoofability is embedding a hash 
	of both the Registry ID and a public key of the entity in the 
	entity identifier, thus making it self-authenticating any time the 
	entity's corresponding private key is used to sign a message.
</t>
<t>	
	While Unlinkability is a privacy desideratum (see <xref target="priv"/>), 
	it imposes requirements on the DRIP identifier itself, as distinct 
	from other currently permitted choices for the UAS ID (including 
	primarily the static serial number of the UA or RID module).

</section>
<section numbered="true" toc="default"> <name>Rationale</name>
<t>
	Most data to be sent via Broadcast RID or Network RID is public;
	thus, the Encrypted Transport requirement for private data is 
	selective, e.g., for the entire payload of the Operator ID Message, 
	but only the pilot/GCS location fields of the System Message. 
	Safety critical data includes at least the UA location. Other data 
	also may be deemed safety critical, e.g., in some jurisdictions the 
	pilot/GCS location is implied to be safety critical.
</t>
<t>
	UAS have several potential means of assessing the likelihood that 
	local Observers authorized to access the plaintext will be able to 
	decrypt it or obtain it from a service able to decrypt it. If the 
	UAS is not participating in UTM, an Observer would have no means of 
	obtaining a decryption key or decryption services from a cognizant 
	USS. If the UAS is participating in UTM but has lost connectivity 
	with its USS, then an Observer within visual LOS of the UA is also 
	unlikely to be able to communicate with that USS (whether due to 
	the USS being offline or the UAS and Observer being in an area with 
	poor Internet connectivity). Either of these conditions (UTM 
	non-participation or USS unreachability) would be known to the UAS.
</t>


<t>	
	In some jurisdictions, the configurable enabling and disabling of 
	encryption may need to be outside the control of the operator. 
	<xref target="FRUR" format="default"/> mandates that manufacturers 
	design RID equipment with some degree of tamper resistance; the 
	preamble of <xref target="FRUR" format="default"/> and other FAA commentary suggest this is to reduce the 
	likelihood that an operator, intentionally or unintentionally, 
	might alter the values of the required data elements or	disable 
	their transmission in the required manner (e.g., as cleartext).
</t>
<t>
	How information is stored on end systems is out of scope for DRIP. 
	Encouraging privacy best practices, including end system storage 
	encryption, by facilitating it with protocol design reflecting such 
	considerations is in scope. Similar logic applies to methods for 
	designating information as public or private.
</t>
<t>
	The Privacy requirements above are for DRIP, neither for <xref
	target="F3411-19" format="default"/> (which, in the interest of
	privacy, requires obfuscation of location to any Network RID
	subscriber engaging in wide area surveillance, limits data retention
	periods, etc.), nor for UAS RID in any specific jurisdiction (which may
	have its own regulatory requirements). The requirements above are also

<section numbered="true" toc="default"> <name>Rationale</name>


<t>
	Registries are fundamental to RID. Only very limited information can
	be transmitted via Broadcast RID, but extended information is sometimes needed. The most
	essential element of information sent is the UAS ID itself, the unique
	key for lookup of extended information in registries.
The regulatory requirements for the registry information models for UAS and
their operators for RID and, more broadly, for U-space/UTM needs are in flux.
Thus, beyond designating the UAS ID as that unique key, the registry information
model is not specified in this document.
	While it is expected that
	registry functions will be integrated with USS, who will provide them
	is expected to vary between jurisdictions and has not yet been determined in
	most jurisdictions. However this evolves, the essential registry
	functions, starting with management of identifiers, are expected to
	remain the same, so those are specified herein.
</t>
<t>	
	While most data to be sent via Broadcast or Network RID is public, 
	much of the extended information in registries will be private. 
	Thus, AAA for registries is essential, not just to ensure that 
	access is granted only to strongly authenticated, duly authorized 
	parties, but also to support subsequent attribution of any leaks, 
	audit of who accessed information when and for what purpose, etc. 
	Specific AAA requirements will vary by jurisdictional 
	regulation, provider philosophy, customer demand, etc., so they are 
	left to specification in policies. Such policies should be human readable 
	to facilitate analysis and discussion, be machine readable to 
	enable automated enforcement, and use a language amenable to both, 
	e.g., eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML).
</t>
<t>
	The intent of the negative and positive access control requirements 
	on registries is to ensure that no member of the public would be 
	hindered from accessing public information, while only duly 
	authorized parties would be enabled to access private information. 
	Mitigation of denial-of-service attacks and refusal to allow 
	database mass scraping would be based on those behaviors, not on 
	identity or role of the party submitting the query per se;
	 however, 
   information on the identity of the party submitting the query might be 
   gathered on such misbehavior by security systems protecting DRIP
   implementations.
</t>
<t>
	"Internet direct contact information" means a locator (e.g., 
	IP address), or identifier (e.g., FQDN) that can be resolved to a 
	locator, which enables initiation of an end-to-end 
	communication session using a well-known protocol (e.g., SIP).

	It may be inferred from the General requirements (<xref target="gen-req"/>) for 
	Provable Ownership, Provable Binding, and Provable Registration, 
	together with the Identifier requirements (<xref target="id-req"/>), that DRIP 
	must provide:
</t>
	<ul>
		<li>
			message integrity
		</li>
		<li>
			non-repudiation
		</li>
		<li>
			defense against replay attacks
		</li>
		<li>
			defense against spoofing
		</li>
	</ul>
<t>	
	One approach to so doing involves verifiably binding the DRIP 
	identifier to a public key. Providing these security features, 
	whether via this approach or another, is likely to be especially 
	challenging for Observers without Internet connectivity at the time 
	of observation. For example, checking the signature of a registry 
	on a public key certificate received via Broadcast RID in a remote 
	area presumably would require that the registry's public key had 
	been previously installed on the Observer's device, yet there may 
	be many registries and the Observer's device may be storage 
	constrained, and new registries may come on-line subsequent to 
	installation of DRIP software on the Observer's device. See also 
	<xref target="Scenario" format="default"/> and the associated 
	explanatory text, especially the second paragraph after the figure. 
	Thus, there may be caveats on the extent to which requirements can 
	be satisfied in such cases, yet strenuous effort should be made to 
	satisfy them, as such cases are important, e.g., firefighting in a national 
	forest. Each numbered requirement a priori 
	expected to suffer from such limitations (General requirements for 
	Gateway and Contact functionality) contains language stating when 
	it applies.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="Privacy" numbered="true" toc="default"> 
<name>Privacy and Transparency Considerations</name>
<t>
	Privacy and transparency are important for legal reasons including 
	regulatory consistency. <xref target="EU2018" format="default"/> 
	states:</t>
	<blockquote>
	harmonised and interoperable national registration 
	systems ... should comply with the applicable Union and national law 
	on privacy and processing of personal data, and the information 
	stored in those registration systems should be easily accessible.
        </blockquote>
<t>	
	Transparency (where essential to security or safety) and privacy
	are also ethical and moral imperatives. Even in cases where old 
	practices (e.g., automobile registration plates) could be imitated, 
	when new applications involving PII (such as UAS RID) are addressed 
	and newer technologies could enable improving privacy, such 
	opportunities should not be squandered. Thus, it is recommended that 
	all DRIP work give due regard to <xref target="RFC6973" 
	format="default"/> and, more broadly, to <xref target="RFC8280" 
	format="default"/>.
</t>
<t>
	However, privacy and transparency are often conflicting goals, 
	demanding careful attention to their balance.
</t>

<t>
DRIP information falls into two classes:</t>
<ul spacing="normal" empty="false">
  <li>that which, to achieve the 
	purpose, must be published openly as cleartext, for the benefit of 
	any Observer (e.g., the basic UAS ID itself); and </li>
   <li>that which must 
	be protected (e.g., PII of pilots) but made available to properly 
	authorized parties (e.g., public safety personnel who urgently need 
   to contact pilots in emergencies).</li>
</ul>
<t>
	How properly authorized parties are authorized, authenticated, etc. 
	are questions that extend beyond the scope of DRIP, but DRIP may be 
	able to provide support for such processes. Classification of 
	information as public or private must be made explicit and 
	reflected with markings, design, etc. Classifying the information 
	will be addressed primarily in external standards; in this document, it will 
	be regarded as a matter for CAA, registry, and operator policies, 
	for which enforcement mechanisms will be defined within the scope 
	of the DRIP WG and offered. Details of the protection mechanisms will 
	be provided in other DRIP documents. Mitigation of adversarial 
	correlation will also be addressed.

<section anchor="Discussion" numbered="true" toc="default"> <name>Discussion and Limitations</name>


<t>
	This document is largely based on the process of one SDO -- ASTM.
	Therefore, it is tailored to specific needs and data formats of ASTM's
	"Standard Specification for Remote ID and Tracking" <xref
	target="F3411-19" format="default"/>. Other organizations (for
	example, in the EU) do not necessarily follow the same architecture.
</t>
<t>
	The need for drone ID and operator privacy is an open discussion 
	topic. For instance, in the ground vehicular domain, each car 
	carries a publicly visible plate number. In some countries, for 
	nominal cost or even for free, anyone can resolve the identity and 
	contact information of the owner. Civil commercial aviation and 
	maritime industries also have a tradition of broadcasting plane or 
	ship ID, coordinates, and even flight plans in plaintext. 
	Community networks such as OpenSky <xref target="OpenSky" 
	format="default"/> and Flightradar24 <xref target="FR24" 
	format="default"/> use this open information through ADS-B to 
	deploy public services of flight tracking. Many researchers also 
	use these data to perform optimization of routes and airport 
	operations. Such ID information should be integrity protected, but 
	not necessarily confidential.
</t>
<t>
	In civil aviation, aircraft identity is broadcast by a device known 
	as transponder. It transmits a four-octal digit squawk code, which 
	is assigned by a traffic controller to an airplane after approving 
	a flight plan. There are several reserved codes, such as 7600, that 
	indicate radio communication failure. The codes are unique in each 
	traffic area and can be re-assigned when entering another control 
	area. The code is transmitted in plaintext by the transponder and 
	also used for collision avoidance by a system known as Traffic 
	alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). The system could be 
	used for UAS as well initially, but the code space is quite limited 
	and likely to be exhausted soon. The number of UAS far exceeds the 
	number of civil airplanes in operation.
</t>
<t>
	The ADS-B system is utilized in civil aviation for each "ADS-B Out" 
	equipped airplane to broadcast its ID, coordinates, and altitude 
	for other airplanes and ground control stations. If this system is 
	adopted for drone IDs, it has additional benefit with backward 
	compatibility with civil aviation infrastructure; then, pilots and 
	dispatchers will be able to see UA on their control screens and 
	take those into account. If not, a gateway translation system 
	between the proposed drone ID and civil aviation system should be 
	implemented. Again, system saturation due to large numbers of UAS 
	is a concern.
</t>
<t>
	The Mode S transponders used in all TCAS and most "ADS-B Out"
	installations are assigned an ICAO 24-bit "address" (arguably 
	really an identifier rather than a locator) that is associated with 
	the aircraft as part of its registration. In the US alone, well 
	over 2<sup>20</sup> UAS are already flying; thus, a 24-bit space likely would 
	be rapidly exhausted if used for UAS (other than large UAS flying 
	in controlled airspace, especially internationally, under rules 
	other than those governing small UAS at low altitudes).
</t>

<t>
	Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are two wireless technologies currently 
	recommended by ASTM specifications due to their widespread use and 
	broadcast nature. However, those have limited range (max 100s of 
	meters) and may not reliably deliver UAS ID at high altitude or 
	distance. Therefore, a study should be made of alternative 
	technologies from the telecom domain (e.g., WiMAX / IEEE 802.16, 5G) or 
	sensor networks (e.g., Sigfox, LoRa). Such transmission technologies can 
	impose additional restrictions on packet sizes and frequency of 
	transmissions but could provide better energy efficiency and 
	range.
</t>
<t>	
	In civil aviation, Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications 
	(CPDLC) is used to transmit command and control between the pilots 
	and ATC. It could be considered for UAS as well due to long-range 
	and proven use despite its lack of security <xref target="CPDLC" 
	format="default"/>.
</t>
<t>
	L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS) is being 
	standardized by ICAO and IETF for use in future civil aviation 
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-raw-ldacs" format="default"/>. LDACS
	provides secure communication, positioning, and control for aircraft 
	using a dedicated radio band. It should be analyzed as a potential 
	provider for UAS RID as well. This will bring the benefit of a 
	global integrated system creating awareness of global airspace use.

	The work of the FAA's UAS Identification and Tracking 
	Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC) is the foundation of later ASTM 
	<xref target="F3411-19" format="default"/> and IETF DRIP efforts. 
	The work of <contact fullname="Gabriel Cox"/>, Intel Corp., and their Open Drone ID 
	collaborators opened UAS RID to a wider community. The work of ASTM 
	F38.02 in balancing the interests of diverse stakeholders is 
	essential to the necessary rapid and widespread deployment of UAS 
	RID. IETF volunteers who have extensively reviewed or otherwise
