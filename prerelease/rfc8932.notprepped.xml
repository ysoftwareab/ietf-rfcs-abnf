    <abstract>

      <t>This document presents operational, policy, and security
      considerations for DNS recursive resolver operators who choose to offer
      DNS privacy services.  With these recommendations, the operator can make
      deliberate decisions regarding which services to provide, as well as
      understanding how those decisions and the alternatives impact the
      privacy of users.
</t>
      <t>This document also presents a non-normative framework to assist
      writers of a Recursive operator Privacy Statement, analogous to DNS
      Security Extensions (DNSSEC) Policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements
      described in RFC 6841.
</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) is at the core of the Internet; almost every
activity on the Internet starts with a DNS query (and often several). However,
the DNS was not originally designed with strong security or privacy
mechanisms.
A number of developments have taken place in recent years that aim to
increase
the privacy of the DNS, and these are now seeing some deployment. This
latest evolution of the DNS presents new challenges to operators, and this
document attempts to provide an overview of considerations for privacy-focused
DNS services.
</t>
      <t>In recent years, there has also been an increase in the availability of
"public
resolvers" <xref target="RFC8499" format="default"/>, which users may prefer
to use instead of the default
network resolver, either because they offer a specific feature (e.g., good
reachability or encrypted transport) or because the network resolver lacks a
specific feature (e.g., strong privacy policy or unfiltered responses). These
public resolvers have tended to be at the forefront of adoption of
privacy-related
enhancements, but it is anticipated that operators of other resolver services
will follow.
</t>
      <t>Whilst protocols that encrypt DNS messages on the wire provide protection
against certain attacks, the resolver operator still has (in principle) full
visibility of the query data and transport identifiers for each
user. Therefore,
a trust relationship (whether explicit or implicit) is assumed to exist
between
each user and the operator of the resolver(s) used by that user. The ability
of
the operator to provide a transparent, well-documented, and secure privacy
service will likely serve as a major differentiating factor for
privacy-conscious users if they make an active selection of which resolver to
use.
</t>
      <t>It should also be noted that there are both advantages and
      disadvantages to a user choosing to configure a single resolver
(or a fixed set of resolvers) and an encrypted transport to use in all network
environments. For example, the user has a
clear expectation of which resolvers have visibility of their query data.
However, this resolver/transport selection may provide an added mechanism for
tracking them as they move across network environments. Commitments from
resolver
operators to minimize such tracking as users move between networks are also
likely to play a role in user selection of resolvers.
</t>
      <t>More recently, the global legislative landscape with regard to personal data
collection, retention, and pseudonymization has seen significant activity.
Providing detailed practice advice about these areas to the operator is out of
scope, but <xref target="data-sharing" format="default"/> describes some mitigations of data-sharing risk.
</t>
      <t>This document has two main goals:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>To provide operational and policy guidance related to DNS over encrypted
transports and to outline recommendations for data handling for operators of
DNS privacy services.</li>
        <li>To introduce the Recursive operator Privacy Statement (RPS) and present a
framework to assist writers of an RPS. An RPS is a
document that an operator should publish that outlines their operational
practices and commitments with regard to privacy, thereby providing a means
for clients to evaluate both the measurable and claimed privacy properties of
a given DNS privacy service. The framework identifies a set of elements and
specifies an outline order for them. This document does not, however, define a
particular privacy statement, nor does it seek to provide legal advice as to
the contents of an RPS.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>A desired operational impact is that all operators (both those providing
resolvers within networks and those operating large public services) can
demonstrate their commitment to user privacy, thereby driving all DNS
resolution
services to a more equitable footing. Choices for users would (in this ideal
world) be driven by other factors -- e.g., differing security policies or minor
differences in operator policy -- rather than gross disparities in privacy
concerns.
</t>

      <t>Community insight (or judgment?) about operational practices can change
quickly, and experience shows that a Best Current Practice (BCP) document
about
privacy and security is a point-in-time statement. Readers are advised to seek
out any updates that apply to this document.

    <section anchor="scope" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Scope</name>
      <t>"DNS Privacy Considerations" <xref target="RFC7626" format="default"/> describes
the general privacy issues
and threats associated with the use of the DNS by Internet users; much of
the threat analysis here is lifted from that document and <xref
target="RFC6973" format="default"/>. However,
this document is limited in scope to best-practice considerations for the
provision of DNS privacy services by servers (recursive resolvers) to clients
(stub resolvers or forwarders). Choices that are made exclusively by
the end user, or those for operators of authoritative nameservers, are out
of scope.
</t>
      <t>This document includes (but is not limited to) considerations in the
following
areas:
</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
        <li>Data "on the wire" between a client and a server.</li>
        <li>Data "at rest" on a server (e.g., in logs).</li>
        <li>Data "sent onwards" from the server (either on the wire or shared
with a
third party).</li>
      </ol>
      <t>Whilst the issues raised here are targeted at those operators who choose to
offer a DNS privacy service, considerations for areas 2 and 3 could equally
apply to operators who only offer DNS over unencrypted transports but who
would
otherwise like to align with privacy best practice.
</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="privacyrelated-documents" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Privacy-Related Documents</name>
      <t>There are various documents that describe protocol changes that have the
potential to either increase or decrease the privacy properties of the DNS in
various ways. Note that this does not imply that some documents are good or bad,
better or worse, just that (for example) some features may bring functional
benefits at the price of a reduction in privacy, and conversely some features
increase privacy with an accompanying increase in complexity. A selection of
the
most relevant documents is listed in <xref target="documents" format="default"/> for

DNS terminology is as described in <xref target="RFC8499"/>, except with
regard to the definition of privacy-enabling DNS server in <xref

the full definition of a DNS over (D)TLS privacy-enabling DNS server as given
in <xref target="RFC8310"/>, i.e., that such a server should also offer at
least one of the credentials described in <xref target="RFC8310" section="8"
sectionFormat="of"/> and implement the (D)TLS profile described in <xref
target="RFC8310" section="9" sectionFormat="of"/>.

      <t>In the following sections, we first outline the threats relevant to the
specific topic and then discuss the potential actions that can be taken to
mitigate them.

      <t>We describe two classes of threats:

	    services that
	    are not directly covered by <xref target="RFC6973"

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>We describe three classes of actions that operators of DNS privacy
services can take:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Threat mitigation for well-understood and documented privacy threats to the
users of the service and, in some cases, the operators of the service.</li>

        <li>Additional options that could further enhance the privacy and usability of
the

      </ul>
      <t>This document does not specify policy, only best practice. However, for DNS
privacy services to be considered compliant with these best-practice
guidelines,
they <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> implement (where appropriate) all:

      <ul spacing="normal">

      <t>The rest of this document does not use normative language but instead
refers
only to the three differing classes of action that correspond to the three
named levels of compliance stated above. However, compliance (to the indicated
level) remains a normative requirement.

nameserver behind such a proxy will appear to originate from the proxy, and DNS
techniques such as Access Control Lists (ACLs), Response Rate Limiting (RRL),

          <t>Data minimization refers to collecting, using, disclosing, and storing the
minimal data necessary to perform a task, and this can be achieved by
removing or obfuscating privacy-sensitive information in network traffic logs.
This is typically personal data or data that can be used to link a record to
an individual, but it may also include other confidential information -- for
example, on the structure of an internal corporate network.
</t>
          <t>The problem of effectively ensuring that DNS traffic logs contain no or
minimal
privacy-sensitive information is not one that currently has a generally agreed
solution or any standards to inform this discussion. This section presents an
overview of current techniques to simply provide reference on the current
status of this work.
</t>
          <t>Research into data minimization techniques (and particularly IP address
pseudonymization/anonymization) was sparked in the late 1990s / early 2000s,
partly driven by the desire to share significant corpuses of traffic captures
for research purposes. Several techniques reflecting different requirements in
this area and different performance/resource trade-offs emerged over the course
of the decade. Developments over the last decade have been both a blessing and
a
curse; the large increase in size between an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, for
example, renders some techniques impractical, but also makes available a much
larger amount of input entropy, the better to resist brute-force
re-identification attacks that have grown in practicality over the period.
</t>
          <t>Techniques employed may be broadly categorized as either anonymization or
pseudonymization. The following discussion uses the definitions from <xref
target="RFC6973" section="3" sectionFormat="comma"/>, with additional
observations from <xref target="van-Dijkhuizen-et-al" format="default"/>.
          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>Anonymization. To enable anonymity of an individual, there must exist a set
of
individuals that appear to have the same attribute(s) as the individual. To
the attacker or the observer, these individuals must appear indistinguishable
from each other.</li>
            <li>Pseudonymization. The true identity is deterministically replaced with an
alternate identity (a pseudonym). When the pseudonymization schema is known,
the process can be reversed, so the original identity becomes known again.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>In practice, there is a fine line between the two; for example,
	  it is difficult to categorize a deterministic algorithm for data
	  minimization of IP addresses that produces a group of pseudonyms for
	  a single given address.

very small
community of users risks exposing data in this way and ought to obfuscate this
traffic by mixing it with "generated" traffic to make client characterization
harder. The resolver could also employ aggressive prefetch techniques as a
further measure to counter traffic analysis.

          <t>At the time of writing, there are no standardized or widely recognized
techniques
to perform such obfuscation or bulk prefetches.
</t>
          <t>Another technique that particularly small operators may consider is
forwarding
local traffic to a larger resolver (with a privacy policy that aligns with
their
own practices) over an encrypted protocol, so that the upstream queries are
obfuscated among those of the large resolver.

      <t>The choice of which method to use for a particular application will depend
on
the requirements of that application and consideration of the threat analysis
of
the particular situation.
</t>

      <t>For example, a common goal is that distributed packet captures must be in
      an existing data format, such as PCAP <xref target="pcap"
      format="default"/> or Compacted-DNS (C-DNS) <xref target="RFC8618"
      format="default"/>, that can be used
      as input to existing analysis tools. In that case, use of a format-preserving
      technique is essential. This, though, is not cost free; several authors
      (e.g., <xref target="Brekne-and-Arnes" format="default"/>) have observed
      that, as the entropy in an IPv4 address is limited, if an attacker can

        <li>obtain a de-identified log of said traffic from that target,</li>

      <t>any format-preserving pseudonymization is vulnerable to an attack along the

        <dl spacing="normal">
          <dt>Format-preserving.</dt><dd> Normally, when encrypting, the original data length and
patterns in the data should be hidden from an attacker. Some applications of
de-identification, such as network capture de-identification, require that the
de-identified data is of the same form as the original data, to allow the data
to be parsed in the same way as the original.</dd>
          <dt>Prefix preservation.</dt><dd> Values such as IP addresses and MAC addresses contain
prefix information that can be valuable in analysis -- e.g., manufacturer ID in
MAC addresses, or subnet in IP addresses. Prefix preservation ensures that
prefixes are de-identified consistently; for example, if two IP addresses are from
the
same subnet, a prefix preserving de-identification will ensure that their
de-identified counterparts will also share a subnet. Prefix preservation may
be fixed (i.e., based on a user-selected prefix length identified in advance to
be preserved ) or general.</dd>
<dt>Replacement.</dt><dd> A one-to-one replacement of a field to a new value of the same
type -- for example, using a regular expression.</dd>
          <dt>Filtering.</dt><dd> Removing or replacing data in a field. Field
data can be overwritten, often with zeros, either partially (truncation or
reverse truncation) or
completely (black-marker anonymization).</dd>
          <dt>Generalization.</dt><dd> Data is replaced by more general data with reduced
specificity. One example would be to replace all TCP/UDP port numbers with one
of two fixed values indicating whether the original port was ephemeral
(&gt;=1024) or nonephemeral (&gt;1024). Another example, precision
degradation,
reduces the accuracy of, for example, a numeric value or a timestamp.</dd>


          <dt>Enumeration.</dt><dd> With data from a well-ordered set, replace
	  the first data item's data using a random initial value and then
	  allocate ordered values for

	  but loses precision and distance.</dd>

          <t>Since May 2010, Google Analytics has provided a facility <xref target="IP-Anonymization-in-Analytics" format="default"/> that allows website
owners to request that all their users' IP addresses are anonymized within
Google Analytics processing. This very basic anonymization simply sets to zero
the least significant 8 bits of IPv4 addresses, and the least significant 80
bits of IPv6 addresses. The level of anonymization this produces is perhaps
questionable. There are some analysis results <xref
target="Geolocation-Impact-Assessment" format="default"/> that suggest that the impact of
this on reducing the accuracy of determining the user's location from their IP
address is less than might be hoped; the average discrepancy in identification
of the user city for UK users is no more than 17%.

          <t>Since 2006, PowerDNS has included a de-identification tool, dnswasher
<xref target="PowerDNS-dnswasher" format="default"/>, with their PowerDNS
product. This is a
PCAP filter that
performs a one-to-one mapping of end-user IP addresses with an anonymized
address. A table of user IP addresses and their de-identified counterparts is
kept; the first IPv4 user addresses is translated to 0.0.0.1, the second to
0.0.0.2, and so on. The de-identified address therefore depends on the order
that
addresses arrive in the input, and when running over a large amount of data, the
address translation tables can grow to a significant size.

          <name>Prefix-Preserving Map</name>
          <t>Used in <xref target="tcpdpriv" format="default"/>,
this algorithm stores a set of original and anonymized IP
address pairs. When a new IP address arrives, it is compared with previous
addresses to determine the longest prefix match. The new address is anonymized
by using the same prefix, with the remainder of the address anonymized with a
random value. The use of a random value means that TCPdpriv is not
deterministic; different anonymized values will be generated on each run. 

The need to store previous addresses means that TCPdpriv has significant and
unbounded memory requirements. The need to allocate anonymized addresses
sequentially means that TCPdpriv cannot be used in parallel processing.

          <name>Cryptographic Prefix-Preserving Pseudonymization</name>
          <t>Cryptographic prefix-preserving pseudonymization was originally proposed as
an
improvement to the prefix-preserving map implemented in TCPdpriv, described in
<xref target="Xu-et-al" format="default"/> and implemented in the <xref target="Crypto-PAn" format="default"/>
tool.
Crypto-PAn is now frequently
used as an acronym for the algorithm. Initially, it was described for IPv4
addresses only; extension for IPv6 addresses was proposed in <xref target="Harvan" format="default"/>. This uses a cryptographic algorithm
rather than a random value, and thus pseudonymity is determined uniquely by
the
encryption key, and is deterministic. It requires a separate AES encryption
for
each output bit and so has a nontrivial calculation overhead. This can be
mitigated to some extent (for IPv4, at least) by precalculating results for
some number of prefix bits.

          <t>Proposed in <xref target="Ramaswamy-and-Wolf" format="default"/>,
Top-hash Subtree-replicated Anonymization (TSA)
originated in response to the requirement for faster processing than
Crypto-PAn.
It used hashing for the most significant byte of an IPv4 address and a
precalculated binary-tree structure for the remainder of the address. 

To save
memory space, replication is used within the tree structure, reducing the size
of the precalculated structures to a few megabytes for IPv4 addresses. Address
pseudonymization is done via hash and table lookup and so requires minimal
computation. However, due to the much-increased address space for IPv6, TSA is
not memory efficient for IPv6.

pseudonymization technique for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. IPv6 addresses are
encrypted directly with AES-128 using a key (which may be derived from a
passphrase). IPv4 addresses are similarly encrypted, but using a recently
proposed encryption <xref target="ipcrypt" format="default"/> suitable for
32-bit block lengths. However, the author of ipcrypt has since indicated <xref

low security, and further analysis has revealed it is vulnerable to attack.

          <t>van Rijswijk-Deij et al.
have recently described work using Bloom Filters <xref target="Bloom-filter" format="default"/>
to
categorize query traffic and record the traffic as the state of multiple
filters. The goal of this work is to allow operators to identify so-called
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) originating from specific subnets without
storing information about, or being able to monitor, the DNS queries of an
individual user. By using a Bloom Filter, it is possible to determine with a
high probability if, for example, a particular query was made, but the set of
queries made cannot be recovered from the filter. Similarly, by mixing queries
from a sufficient number of users in a single filter, it becomes practically
impossible to determine if a particular user performed a particular
query. Large
numbers of queries can be tracked in a memory-efficient way. As filter status
is
stored, this approach cannot be used to regenerate traffic and so cannot be
used with tools used to process live traffic.
