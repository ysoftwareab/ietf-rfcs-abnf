      <t>This document specifies a Session Description Protocol (SDP) grouping
      mechanism for RTP media streams that can be used to specify relations
      between media streams.</t>
      <t>This mechanism is used to signal the association between the SDP
      concept of "media description" and the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) concept of
      MediaStream/MediaStreamTrack using SDP signaling.</t>

        streams and attach identifiers to the groupings they form. It is

        information and procedures for using the "msid" attribute to signal the

        <name>Why a New Mechanism Is Needed</name>

        <t>When media is carried by RTP <xref target="RFC3550"
	format="default"/>, each RTP stream is distinguished inside an RTP
	session by its Synchronization Source (SSRC); each RTP
        session is distinguished from all other RTP sessions by being on a
        different transport association (strictly speaking, two transport
        associations, one used for RTP and one used for the RTP Control Protocol
	(RTCP), unless RTP/RTCP multiplexing <xref target="RFC5761" format="default"/> is used).</t> 

        <t>SDP <xref target="RFC4566" format="default"/> gives a format for describing an SDP
        session that can contain multiple media descriptions. According to the
        model used in <xref target="RFC8829" format="default"/>, each media
        description describes exactly one media source. If multiple media
        sources are carried in an RTP session, this is signaled using BUNDLE
        <xref target="RFC8843" format="default"/>; if BUNDLE is
        not used, each media source is carried in its own RTP session.</t>
        <t>The SDP Grouping Framework <xref target="RFC5888" format="default"/> can be used to
        group media descriptions. However, for the use case of WebRTC, there
        is the need for an application to specify some application-level
        information about the association between the media description and
        the group. This is not possible using the SDP Grouping Framework.</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>The WebRTC MediaStream</name>
        <t>The W3C WebRTC API specification <xref target="W3C-WebRTC" format="default"/> specifies that communication between
        WebRTC entities is done via MediaStreams, which contain
        MediaStreamTracks. A MediaStreamTrack is generally carried using a
        single SSRC in an RTP session, forming an RTP stream. The collision of
        terminology is unfortunate. There might possibly be additional SSRCs,
        possibly within additional RTP sessions, in order to support
        functionality like forward error correction or simulcast. These
        additional SSRCs are not affected by this specification.</t>
        <t>MediaStreamTracks are unidirectional; they carry media in one
        direction only.</t>
        <t>In the RTP specification, RTP streams are identified using the SSRC
        field. Streams are grouped into RTP sessions and also carry a CNAME.
        Neither CNAME nor RTP session corresponds to a MediaStream. Therefore,
        the association of an RTP stream to MediaStreams need to be explicitly
        signaled.</t>
        <t>WebRTC defines a mapping (documented in <xref target="RFC8829" format="default"/>) where one SDP media description is
        used to describe each MediaStreamTrack, and the BUNDLE mechanism <xref
	target="RFC8843" format="default"/> is
	used to group 
        MediaStreamTracks into RTP sessions. Therefore, the need is to specify
        the identifier (ID) of the MediaStreamTrack and its associated MediaStream for each
        media description, which can be accomplished with a media-level SDP
        attribute.</t>
        <t>This usage is described in <xref target="sect-media-stream" format="default"/>.</t>

      <name>The MSID Mechanism</name>
      <t>This document defines a new SDP <xref target="RFC4566" format="default"/> media-level
      "msid" attribute. 
   This new attribute allows endpoints to associate RTP
   streams that are described in separate media descriptions with the
   right MediaStreams, as defined in <xref target="W3C-WebRTC"
      format="default"/>. It also allows endpoints to carry an identifier for
      each MediaStreamTrack in its "appdata" field.</t>
      <t>The value of the "msid" attribute consists of an identifier and an
      optional "appdata" field.</t>
      <t>The name of the attribute is "msid".</t>
      <t>The value of the attribute is specified by the following ABNF <xref
      target="RFC5234" format="default"/> grammar:</t>

<sourcecode type="abnf" >
  msid-value = msid-id [ SP msid-appdata ]
  msid-id = 1*64token-char ; see RFC 4566
  msid-appdata = 1*64token-char  ; see RFC 4566
</sourcecode>
      <t>An example "msid" value for a group with the identifier "examplefoo"
      and application data "examplebar" might look like this:</t>

<sourcecode>
  msid:examplefoo examplebar
</sourcecode>

      <t>The identifier is a string of ASCII characters that are legal in a
      "token", consisting of between 1 and 64 characters.</t>
      <t>Application data (msid-appdata) is carried on the same line as the
      identifier, separated from the identifier by a space.</t>
      <t>The identifier ("msid-id") uniquely identifies a group within the scope
      of an SDP description.</t>
      <t>There may be multiple "msid" attributes in a single media description.
      This represents the case where a single MediaStreamTrack is present in
      multiple MediaStreams; the value of "msid-appdata" <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be identical for
      all occurrences.</t>
      <t>Multiple media descriptions with the same value for "msid-id" and
      "msid&nbhy;appdata" are not permitted.</t>
      <t>Endpoints can update the associations between RTP streams as
      expressed by "msid" attributes at any time.</t>
      <t>The "msid" attributes depend on the association of RTP streams with
      media descriptions but do not depend on the association of RTP
      streams with RTP transports. Therefore, their Mux Category (as defined in
      <xref target="RFC8859" format="default"/>) is NORMAL; the
      process of deciding on "msid" attributes doesn't have to take into
      consideration whether or not the RTP streams are bundled.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="sect-media-stream" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Procedures</name>
      <t>This section describes the procedures for associating media
      descriptions representing MediaStreamTracks within MediaStreams, as
      defined in <xref target="W3C-WebRTC" format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>In the Javascript API described in that specification, each
      MediaStream and MediaStreamTrack has an "id" attribute, which is a
      DOMString.</t>

      <t>The value of the "msid-id" field in the MSID consists of the "id"
      attribute of a MediaStream, as defined in the MediaStream's WebIDL
      specification <xref target="WEBIDL" format="default"/>. The special value "-" indicates "no MediaStream".</t>
      <t>The value of the "msid-appdata" field in the MSID, if present,
      consists of the
      "id" attribute of a MediaStreamTrack, as defined in the
      MediaStreamTrack's WebIDL specification.</t>
      <t>When an SDP session description is updated, a specific "msid-id"
      value continues to refer to the same MediaStream, and a specific
      "msid-appdata" to the same MediaStreamTrack. There is no memory apart
      from the currently valid SDP descriptions; if an MSID "identifier" value
      disappears from the SDP and appears in a later negotiation, it will be
      taken to refer to a new MediaStream.</t>
      <t>If the "msid" attribute does not conform to the ABNF given here, it
      <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be ignored.</t>

      <t>The following is a high-level description of the rules for handling
      SDP updates. Detailed procedures are located in <xref
      target="s-detailed-procedures" format="default"/>.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>When a new MSID "identifier" value occurs in a session
          description, and it is not "-", the recipient can signal to its
          application that a new MediaStream has been added.</li>
        <li>When a session description is updated to have media descriptions
          with an MSID "identifier" value, with one or more different
          "appdata" values, the recipient can signal to its application that
          new MediaStreamTracks have been added and note to which MediaStream
	  they have
          been added. This is done for each different MSID "identifier"
          value, including the special value "-", which indicates that a
          MediaStreamTrack has been added with no corresponding
          MediaStream.</li>
        <li>If an MSID "identifier" value with no "appdata" value appears,
	  it means that the sender did not inform the recipient of the desired
	  identifier of the MediaStreamTrack, and the recipient will assign
	  the "id" value of the created MediaStreamTrack on its own. All
	  MSIDs in a media section that do not have an "appdata" value are
	  assumed to refer to the same MediaStreamTrack.</li>
        <li>When a session description is updated to no longer list any "msid"
          attribute on a specific media description, the recipient can signal
          to its application that the corresponding MediaStreamTrack has
          ended.</li>
      </ul>

      <t>In addition to signaling that the track is ended when its "msid"
   attribute disappears from the SDP, the track will also be signaled as
      being ended when all associated SSRCs have disappeared by the rules of
      <xref target="RFC3550" />, Sections <xref target="RFC3550"
      section="6.3.4" sectionFormat="bare"/>
       (BYE packet received) and <xref
       target="RFC3550" section="6.3.5" sectionFormat="bare"/>
       (timeout), or when the corresponding media description is disabled by
      setting the port number to zero. Changing the direction of the media
      description (by setting "sendonly", "recvonly", or "inactive" attributes)
      will not end the MediaStreamTrack.</t>
      <t>The association between SSRCs and media descriptions is specified in
      <xref target="RFC8829" format="default"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="s-nonsignal" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Handling of Nonsignaled Tracks</name> 
        <t>Entities that do not use the mechanism described in this document will not send the
	"msid" attribute and thus will not send information allowing the mapping of RTP packets to MediaStreams. This means that there will be some incoming RTP packets for which the recipient has no predefined MediaStream ID value.</t>

        <t>Note that the handling described below is triggered by incoming RTP packets, not
        SDP negotiation.</t>

        <t>When communicating with entities that use the MSID mechanism, the only time incoming RTP packets 
        can be received without an associated MediaStream ID value is when, after the
        initial negotiation, a negotiation is performed where the answerer
        adds a MediaStreamTrack to an already established connection and
        starts sending data before the answer is received by the offerer. For
        initial negotiation, packets won't flow until the Interactive
	Connectivity Establishment (ICE) candidates and
        fingerprints have been exchanged, so this is not an issue.</t>
        <t>The recipient of those packets will perform the following
        steps:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">

          <li>When RTP packets are initially received, it will create an
            appropriate MediaStreamTrack based on the type of the media
            (carried in PayloadType) and use the MID RTP header extension
            <xref target="RFC8843" format="default"/> (if
            present) to associate the RTP packets with a specific media
            section.</li>
          <li>If the connection is not in the RTCSignalingState "stable", it
            will wait at this point.</li>
          <li>When the connection is in the RTCSignalingState "stable", it
            will assign ID values.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The following steps are performed to assign ID values:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>If there is an "msid" attribute, it will use that attribute to
            populate the "id" field of the MediaStreamTrack and associated
            MediaStreams, as described above.</li>
          <li>If there is no "msid" attribute, the identifier of the
            MediaStreamTrack will be set to a randomly generated string, and
            it will be signaled as being part of a MediaStream with the
            WebIDL "label" attribute set to "Non-WebRTC stream".</li>
          <li>After deciding on the "id" field to be applied to the
            MediaStreamTrack, the track will be signaled to the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The process above may involve a considerable amount of buffering
        before the "stable" state is entered. If the implementation wishes to
        limit this buffering, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> signal to the user that media has been
        discarded.</t>
        <t>It follows from the above that MediaStreamTracks in the "default"
        MediaStream cannot be closed by removing the "msid" attribute; the
        application must instead signal these as closed when the SSRC
        disappears, either according to the rules of Sections <xref target="RFC3550" section="6.3.4"
	sectionFormat="bare" /> and  <xref target="RFC3550" section="6.3.5"
	sectionFormat="bare" /> of <xref target="RFC3550"

        <t>IANA has registered the "msid" attribute in the

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>An adversary with the ability to modify SDP descriptions has the
      ability to switch around tracks between MediaStreams. This is a special
      case of the general security consideration that modification of SDP
      descriptions needs to be confined to entities trusted by the
      application.</t>
      <t>If implementing buffering as mentioned in <xref target="s-nonsignal" format="default"/>, the amount of buffering should be limited to
      avoid memory exhaustion attacks.</t>
      <t>Careless generation of identifiers can leak privacy-sensitive
      information. <xref target="W3C.CR-mediacapture-streams" format="default"/>
      recommends that identifiers be generated using a Universally Unique
      IDentifier (UUID) class 3 or 4 as a
      basis, which avoids such leakage.</t>
      <t>No other attacks have been identified that depend on this
      mechanism.</t>

      <name>Design Considerations, Rejected Alternatives</name>
      <t>One suggested mechanism has been to use CNAME instead of a new
      attribute. This was abandoned because CNAME identifies a synchronization
      context; one can imagine both wanting to have tracks from the same
      synchronization context in multiple MediaStreams and wanting to have
      tracks from multiple synchronization contexts within one MediaStream
      (but the latter is impossible, since a MediaStream is defined to impose
      synchronization on its members).</t>
      <t>Another suggestion has been to put the "msid" value within an attribute
      of RTCP SR (sender report) packets. This doesn't offer the ability to
      know that you have seen all the tracks currently configured for a
      MediaStream.</t>
      <t>A suggestion that survived for a number of drafts of this document was to define
      MSID as a generic mechanism, where the particular semantics of this
      usage of the mechanism would be defined by an "a=wms-semantic"
      attribute. This was removed in April 2015.</t>
