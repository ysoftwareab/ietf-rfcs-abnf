      <t>
        The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol
        describes a Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal mechanism
        for UDP-based multimedia sessions established with the
        Offer/Answer model. The ICE extension for Incremental
        Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE) defines a mechanism
        that allows ICE Agents to shorten session establishment delays
        by making the candidate gathering and connectivity checking
        phases of ICE non-blocking and by executing them in parallel.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with the Session
        Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The document also defines a new SIP Info
        Package to support this usage together with the corresponding media
        type.  Additionally, a new Session Description Protocol (SDP)
        "end-of-candidates" attribute and a new SIP option tag "trickle-ice"
        are defined.

      <t>
        The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol
        <xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/> describes
        a mechanism for Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal
        that consists of three main phases.
      </t>
      <t>
        During the first phase, an agent gathers a set of candidate
        transport addresses (source IP, port, and transport
        protocol).
        This is followed by a second phase
        where these candidates are sent to a
        remote agent within
        the Session Description Protocol (SDP) body of a SIP message.
        At the remote agent, the gathering procedure is repeated and
        candidates are sent to the first agent.
        Once the candidate information is available, a third phase
        starts in parallel where connectivity between all candidates
        in both sets is checked (connectivity checks).
        Once these phases
        have been completed, and only then, both agents can begin
        communication.
      </t>
      <t>
        According to <xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/>,
        the three phases above happen consecutively, in a blocking way,
        which can introduce undesirable setup delay during session
        establishment.
        The Trickle ICE extension
        <xref target="RFC8838" format="default"/> defines generic
        semantics required for these ICE phases to happen
        in a parallel, non-blocking way and hence speeds up session
        establishment.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines a usage of Trickle ICE with
        the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)<xref target="RFC3261" format="default"/>.
        It describes how ICE
        candidates are to be exchanged incrementally using SIP INFO
        requests <xref target="RFC6086" format="default"/>
        and how the Half Trickle and Full Trickle modes defined in
        <xref target="RFC8838" format="default"/> are to be used by
        SIP User Agents (UAs) depending on their expectations for
        support of Trickle ICE by a remote agent.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines a new Info Package as specified in
        <xref target="RFC6086" format="default"/> for use with Trickle ICE together
        with the corresponding media type,
        SDP attribute, and SIP option tag.

      <t>
        When using  ICE for SIP according to
        <xref target="RFC8839" format="default"/>,
        the ICE candidates are exchanged solely via
        SDP Offer/Answer as per <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/>.
        This specification defines an additional mechanism
        where candidates can be exchanged using SIP INFO messages
        and a newly defined Info Package <xref target="RFC6086" format="default"/>.
        This also allows ICE
        candidates to be sent in parallel to an ongoing Offer/Answer
        negotiation and/or after the completion of the Offer/Answer
        negotiation.
      </t>
      <t>
        Typically, in cases where Trickle ICE is fully supported,
        the Offerer sends an INVITE request
        containing a subset of candidates.
        Once an early dialog is established,
        the Offerer can continue sending
        candidates in INFO requests within that dialog.
      </t>
      <t>
        Similarly, an Answerer can send
        ICE candidates using INFO requests within
        the dialog established by its 18x provisional response.
        <xref target="fig-intro-example" format="default"/> shows such a sample

        <name>Discovery Issues</name>
        <t>
          In order to benefit from Trickle ICE's full potential and
          reduce session establishment latency to a minimum, Trickle ICE
          Agents need to generate SDP Offers and Answers that contain
          incomplete and potentially empty sets of candidates. Such Offers
          and Answers can only be handled meaningfully by agents that
          actually support incremental candidate provisioning, which
          implies the need to confirm such support before  using
          it.
        </t>
        <t>
          Contrary to other protocols,
          where "in advance" capability
          discovery is widely implemented, the mechanisms that allow this
          for SIP (i.e., a combination of UA capabilities
          <xref target="RFC3840" format="default"/> and Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) <xref target="RFC5627" format="default"/>)
          have only seen low levels of adoption.
          This presents an issue
          for Trickle ICE implementations as SIP UAs do not have an
          obvious means of verifying that their peer will support
          incremental candidate provisioning.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Half Trickle mode of operation defined in the Trickle
          ICE specification <xref target="RFC8838" format="default"/>
          provides one way around this, by requiring the first Offer to
          contain a complete set of local ICE candidates
          and using only
          incremental provisioning of remote candidates
          for the rest of the session.
        </t>
        <t>
          While using Half Trickle does provide a working solution, it
          also comes at the price of increased latency. Therefore,
          <xref target="disco" format="default"/> makes several alternative
          suggestions that enable SIP UAs to engage in Full Trickle
          right from their first Offer: <xref target="disco-prov" format="default"/>
          discusses the use of online provisioning as a means of
          allowing the use of Trickle ICE for all endpoints in controlled
          environments. <xref target="disco-gruu" format="default"/> describes
          anticipatory discovery for implementations that actually do
          support GRUU and UA capabilities, and
          <xref target="half-full-trickle" format="default"/> discusses the implementation
          and use of Half Trickle by SIP UAs where none of the above
          are an option.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Relationship with the Offer/Answer Model</name>
        <t>
          From the perspective of SIP middleboxes and proxies,
          the Offer/Answer exchange for
          Trickle ICE looks partly similar to the Offer/Answer exchange
          for regular ICE for SIP
          <xref target="RFC8839" format="default"/>.
          However, in order to have the full picture of the candidate
          exchange, the newly introduced INFO messages
          need to be considered as well.

          From an architectural viewpoint, as displayed in
          <xref target="fig-oa-and-trickle" format="default"/>, exchanging candidates
          through SIP INFO requests could be represented as signaling
          between ICE modules and not between Offer/Answer modules of
          SIP UAs. Then, such INFO requests
          do not impact the state of the Offer/Answer transaction other
          than providing additional candidates.
          Consequently, INFO requests are not considered Offers or Answers.
          Nevertheless, candidates that have been exchanged
          using INFO requests
          <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be included in subsequent Offers or Answers.
          The version number in the "o=" line of that subsequent Offer
          needs to be incremented by 1 per the rules

          <t>If the Offerer wants to send its initial Offer

          ICE once an Offer and an Answer have been exchanged,

            As shown in <xref target="offerer-can-trickle" format="default"/>,
            satisfying both conditions is relatively trivial for
            ICE Agents that have sent an Offer in an INVITE and that have
            received an Answer in a reliable provisional response.
            It is guaranteed to have confirmed support (or lack thereof) for
            Trickle ICE at the Answerer and to have
            fully initialized the SIP dialog at both ends.
            Offerers and Answerers (after receipt of the PRACK request)
            in the above situation can therefore
            freely commence trickling within the newly established dialog.

            In order to clear this ambiguity as soon as possible,
            the Answerer needs to retransmit the provisional response
            with the exponential backoff timers described in
            <xref target="RFC3262" format="default"/>.
            These retransmissions <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> cease on receipt
            of an INFO request carrying a "trickle-ice" Info Package body,
            on receipt of any other in-dialog request from the Offerer, or
            on transmission of the Answer in a 2xx response.
            The Offerer cannot send in-dialog requests until it receives
            a response, so the arrival of such a request proves that
            the response has arrived.
            Using the INFO request for dialog confirmation
            is similar to the procedure described in
            <xref target="RFC8839" sectionFormat="of" section="7.1.1"/>, except that
            the STUN binding request is replaced by the INFO request.
          </t>
          <t>
            The Offerer <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send a Trickle ICE INFO request as soon as
            it receives an SDP Answer in an unreliable provisional
            response. This INFO request <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> repeat the candidates
            that were already provided in the Offer (as would be the case
            when Half Trickle is performed or when new candidates have not
            been learned since then).
            The first case could happen when Half Trickle is used and
            all candidates are already in the initial offer.
            The second case could happen when Full Trickle is used and
            the Offerer is currently gathering additional candidates
            but did not yet get them.
            Also, if the initial Offer did not contain any candidates,
            depending on how the Offerer gathers its candidates and
            how long it takes to do so, this INFO could still contain no candidates.
          </t>
          <t>
            When Full Trickle is used and if newly learned candidates
            are available, the Offerer <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also deliver
            these candidates in said INFO request,
            unless it wants to hold back some candidates in reserve,
            e.g., in case these candidates
            are expensive to use and would only be trickled
            if all other candidates failed.
          </t>
          <t>
            The Offerer <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> include an "end-of-candidates" attribute
            in case candidate discovery has ended in the meantime
            and no further candidates are to be trickled.
          </t>
          <t>
            As soon as an Answerer has received such an INFO request,
            the Answerer has an indication that a dialog is established
            at both ends and trickling can begin

          When sending the Answer in the 200 OK response to the INVITE request,
          the Answerer needs to repeat
          exactly the same Answer that was previously sent
          in the unreliable provisional
          response in order to fulfill the corresponding requirements in
          <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/>.
          Thus, the Offerer needs to be prepared
          for receiving a different number of candidates
          in that repeated Answer than previously exchanged via trickling
          and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore the candidate information

          <t>
            The ability to convey arbitrary candidates in INFO
            message bodies allows ICE Agents to initiate trickling
            without actually sending an Answer.
            Trickle ICE Agents can therefore respond to an INVITE request
            with provisional responses without an SDP Answer
            <xref target="RFC3261" format="default"/>.
            Such provisional responses serve for establishing an early dialog.
          </t>
          <t>
            Agents that choose to establish the dialog in this way
            <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> retransmit these responses
            with the exponential backoff timers described in
            <xref target="RFC3262" format="default"/>.
            These retransmissions <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> cease on receipt
            of an INFO request carrying a "trickle-ice" Info Package body,
            on receipt of any in-dialog requests from the Offerer, or
            on transmission of the Answer in a 2xx response.
            The Offerer cannot send in-dialog requests until it receives
            a response, so the arrival of such a request proves that
            the response has arrived.
            This is again similar to the procedure described in
            <xref target="RFC8839" sectionFormat="of" section="6.1.1"/>,

        <name>Delivering Candidates in INFO Requests</name>
        <t>
        Whenever new ICE candidates become available for sending,
        agents encode them in "candidate" attributes as described
        by <xref target="RFC8839" format="default"/>. For example:
        </t>
        
  <sourcecode type="sdp"><![CDATA[
  a=candidate:1 1 UDP 2130706432 200a0b:12f0::1 5000 typ host ]]></sourcecode>
        <t>
          The use of SIP INFO requests happens within the context of the
          Info Package as defined in <xref target="info-package" format="default"/>.
          The media type
          <xref target="RFC6838" format="default"/>
          for their payload <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to
          "application/trickle-ice-sdpfrag" as defined in
          <xref target="trickle_ice_sdpfrag_def" format="default"/>.
          The INFO request body adheres to the grammar as specified in
          <xref target="trickle_ice_sdpfrag_grammar" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since neither the "candidate" nor the "end-of-candidates"
          attributes contain information that would allow correlating them to
          a specific "m=" line,
          it is handled through the use of
          pseudo "m=" lines.
        </t>
        <t>
          Pseudo "m=" lines follow the SDP syntax for "m=" lines as
          defined in
          <xref target="RFC4566" format="default"/> and are linked to the corresponding "m=" line
          in the SDP Offer or Answer via the identification tag
          in a "mid" attribute
          <xref target="RFC5888" format="default"/>.
          A pseudo  "m=" line does not provide semantics other
          than indicating to which "m=" line a candidate belongs.
          Consequently, the receiving agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore any remaining content of the pseudo "m=" line,
          which is not defined in this document.
          This guarantees that the  "application/trickle-ice-sdpfrag" bodies do not interfere with the Offer/Answer
          procedures as specified in <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
        When sending the INFO request, the agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>,
        if already known to the  agent, include the same content into
        the pseudo "m=" line as for the "m=" line in the corresponding Offer or Answer.
        However, since Trickle ICE might be decoupled from the Offer/Answer negotiation, the content might
        be unknown to the agent. In this case, the agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the following default values:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
              The media field is set to 'audio'.
            </li>
          <li>
              The port value is set to '9'.
            </li>
          <li>
              The proto value is set to 'RTP/AVP'.
            </li>
          <li>
              The fmt field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> appear only once and is set to '0'.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
        Agents <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include  a pseudo "m=" line and an
          identification tag in a "mid" attribute for every "m=" line
          whose candidate list they intend to update.
          Such "mid" attributes <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
          immediately precede the list of candidates for that specific
          "m=" line.
        </t>
        <t>
          All "candidate" or "end-of-candidates" attributes
          following a "mid" attribute, up until (and excluding) the next
          occurrence of a pseudo "m=" line, pertain to the "m=" line
          identified by that identification tag.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note, that there is no requirement that the INFO request body
          contains as many pseudo "m=" lines as the Offer/Answer
          contains "m=" lines, nor that the pseudo "m=" lines be in the same
          order as the "m=" lines that they pertain to.
          The correspondence can be made via the "mid" attributes
          since candidates are grouped in sections headed
          by "pseudo" "m=" lines.
          These sections contain "mid" attribute values that point
          back to the true "m=" line.
        </t>
        <t>
          An "end-of-candidates" attribute, preceding
          the first pseudo "m=" line, indicates the end of all trickling
          from that agent,
          as opposed to end of trickling for a specific "m=" line,
          which would be indicated by a media-level
          "end-of-candidates" attribute.
        </t>
        <t>
            Refer to
            <xref target="INFOexample" format="default"/>
            for an example of the INFO request content.
        </t>
        <t>
          The use of pseudo "m=" lines allows for a structure similar to
          the one in SDP Offers and Answers where
          separate media-level and session-level sections can be distinguished.
          In the current case, lines preceding the first
          pseudo "m=" line are considered to be session level.
          Lines appearing in between or after
          pseudo "m=" lines will be interpreted as media level.
        </t>

    <aside>
      <t>
              Note that while this specification uses the "mid"
              attribute from <xref target="RFC5888" format="default"/>, it does not
              define any grouping semantics.
	    </t>
    </aside>
        <t>
          All INFO requests <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> carry the "ice-pwd" and "ice-ufrag"
          attributes that allow mapping them to a specific ICE generation.
          An agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> discard any received INFO requests containing "ice-pwd" and "ice-ufrag"
          attributes that do not match those of the current ICE Negotiation Session.
        </t>
        <t>
          The "ice-pwd" and "ice-ufrag" attributes <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> appear at the same level
          as the ones in the Offer/Answer exchange.
          In other words, if they were present
          as session-level attributes, they will also appear
          at the beginning of all INFO request payloads, i.e., preceding
          the first pseudo "m=" line.
          If they were originally exchanged as media-level
          attributes, potentially overriding session-level values,
          then they will also be included in INFO request payloads
          following the corresponding pseudo "m=" lines.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that
          when candidates are trickled, <xref target="RFC8838" format="default"/> 
          requires that each candidate must be delivered
          to the receiving Trickle ICE implementation not more than once
          and in the same order as it was conveyed.
          If the signaling protocol provides any candidate retransmissions,
          they need to be hidden from the ICE implementation.
          This requirement is fulfilled as follows.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since the agent is not fully aware of the state of the ICE Negotiation Session at its peer,
          it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include all currently known and used local candidates in every INFO request.
          That is, the agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> repeat in the INFO request body
          all candidates that were previously sent under the same
          combination of "ice-pwd" and "ice-ufrag"
          in the same order as they were sent before.
          In other words, the sequence of a previously sent
          list of candidates <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> change in subsequent INFO requests,
          and newly gathered candidates <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be added
          at the end of that list.
          Although repeating all candidates creates some overhead, it also allows easier handling of problems
          that could arise from unreliable transports like, e.g., loss of messages and reordering,
          which can be detected through the CSeq: header field in the INFO request.
        </t>
        <t>
          In addition, an ICE Agent needs to adhere to
          <xref target="RFC8838" sectionFormat="of" section="17"/>
          on preserving candidate order while trickling.
        </t>
        <t>
          When receiving INFO requests carrying any candidates, agents
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> first identify and discard the attribute lines
          containing candidates they have already received in previous
          INFO requests or in the Offer/Answer exchange preceding them.
        </t>
        <t> Such candidates are considered to be equal if their IP address
          port, transport, and component ID are the same.
          After identifying and discarding the known candidates,
          the agents <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> forward the actual new candidates to the ICE Agents
          in the same order as they were received in the INFO request body.
          The ICE Agents will then process the new candidates
          according to the rules described in <xref target="RFC8838" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t> Receiving an "end-of-candidates" attribute in an INFO request body
        -- with the "ice-ufrag" and "ice-pwd" attributes matching the current ICE generation --
        is an indication from the peer agent that it will not send any further candidates.
        When included at the session level, i.e., before any pseudo "m=" line,
        this indication applies to the whole session;
        when included at the media level, the indication applies
        only to the corresponding "m=" line.
        Handling of such end-of-candidates indications is defined in
        <xref target="RFC8838" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The example in <xref target="INFOexample" format="default"/> shows the content
           of a candidate delivering INFO request. In the example, the
           "end-of-candidates" attributes indicate that
           the candidate gathering is finished and
           that no further INFO requests follow.

      <name>Initial Discovery of Trickle ICE Support</name>
      <t>
         SIP UAs are required by <xref target="RFC8838" format="default"/> to indicate their support of and intent to use Trickle ICE in their Offers and Answers by using the "ice-options:trickle" attribute, and they <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the SIP option-tag "trickle-ice" in
          a SIP Supported: or Require: header field.
          This makes discovery
          fairly straightforward for Answerers or for cases where
          Offers need to be generated within existing dialogs (i.e.,
          when sending UPDATE or re-INVITE requests).
          In both scenarios, prior
          SDP bodies will have provided the necessary information.
      </t>
      <t>
          Obviously, such information is not available at the time a first
          Offer is being constructed, and it is therefore impossible
          for ICE Agents to determine support for incremental
          provisioning that way. The following options are suggested as
          ways of addressing this issue.
      </t>
      <section anchor="disco-prov" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Provisioning Support for Trickle ICE</name>
        <t>
            In certain situations, it may be possible for integrators
            deploying Trickle ICE to know in advance that some or all
            endpoints reachable from within the deployment will support
            Trickle ICE.
            This is the case, for example, if Session Border Controllers
            (SBCs) with support for this specification are used
            to connect to UAs that do not support Trickle ICE.

            is out of scope here, this specification encourages trickle
            ICE implementations to allow the option in the way they find
            most appropriate.
        </t>
        <t>
            However, an Offerer assuming Trickle ICE support <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
            include a SIP Require: trickle-ice header field.
            That way, if the provisioned assumption of Trickle ICE support
            ends up being incorrect, the failure is (a) operationally
            easy to track down and (b) recoverable by the client,
            i.e., they can resend the request without the
            SIP Require: header field and without
            the assumption of Trickle ICE support.

            <xref target="RFC3840" format="default"/> provides a way for SIP UAs
            to query for support of specific capabilities using, among
            others, OPTIONS requests. On the other hand, support for
            GRUU according to
            <xref target="RFC5627" format="default"/>
            allows SIP requests to be addressed to specific UAs (as
            opposed to arbitrary instances of an address of record).
            Combining the two and using the "trickle-ice" option tag
            defined in <xref target="option-tag" format="default"/> provides SIP UAs with
            a way of learning the capabilities of specific SIP UA instances
            and then addressing them directly with INVITE requests that
            require Trickle ICE support.
        </t>
        <t>
            Such learning of capabilities may happen in different ways.
            One option for a SIP UA is to learn the
            GRUU instance ID of a peer through presence and then to query
            its capabilities with an OPTIONS request.
            Alternatively, it can also just send an OPTIONS request to
            the Address of Record (AOR) it intends to contact and then inspect the returned
            response(s) for support of both GRUU and Trickle ICE
            (<xref target="options-gruu" format="default"/>).
            It is noted that using the GRUU means that the INVITE request
            can go only to that particular device.
            This prevents the use of forking for that request.

            Confirming support for Trickle ICE through
            <xref target="RFC3840" format="default"/> gives SIP UAs the option to engage
            in Full Trickle negotiation (as opposed to the more lengthy
            Half Trickle) from the very first Offer they send.

            In cases where none of the other mechanisms in this section
            are acceptable, SIP UAs should use the Half Trickle mode
            defined in <xref target="RFC8838" format="default"/>.
            With Half Trickle, agents initiate sessions the same way
            they would when using ICE for SIP
            <xref target="RFC8839" format="default"/>.
            This means that, prior to actually sending an Offer, agents
            first gather ICE candidates in a blocking way and then
            send them all in that Offer. The blocking nature of the
            process implies that some amount of latency will
            be accumulated, and it is advised that agents try to
            anticipate it where possible, for example, when user
            actions indicate a high likelihood for an imminent call
            (e.g., activity on a keypad or a phone going off hook).
        </t>
        <t>
            Using Half Trickle results in Offers that are
            compatible with both ICE SIP endpoints <xref target="RFC8839" format="default"/> and legacy
            endpoints <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/>.

          As a reminder, once a single Offer or Answer has

          Trickle ICE will have been determined.
          No further use of Half Trickle will therefore be necessary

        <xref target="RFC8445" sectionFormat="of" section="5.1.1.1"/> and
        in <xref target="RFC5761" format="default"/>.
        These considerations are still valid for Trickle ICE; however,
        trickling provides more flexibility for the sequence of candidate exchange in case of RTCP multiplexing.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the Offerer supports RTP/RTCP multiplexing exclusively as specified
        in <xref target="RFC8858" format="default"/>,
        the procedures in that document apply for the handling of the "rtcp-mux-only", "rtcp", and "rtcp-mux" attributes.
      </t>
      <t>
        While a Half Trickle Offerer has to send an Offer compliant to
        <xref target="RFC8839" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC5761" format="default"/> including candidates for all components, the flexibility of a Full Trickle Offerer allows
        the sending of only RTP candidates (component 1) in the initial Offer
        assuming that RTCP multiplexing is supported by the Answerer.
        A Full Trickle Offerer would need to start gathering and trickling
        RTCP candidates (component 2)
        only after having received an indication in the Answer that
        the Answerer unexpectedly does not support RTCP multiplexing.
      </t>
      <t>
        A Trickle Answerer <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include an "rtcp-mux" attribute
        <xref target="RFC5761" format="default"/> in the "application/trickle-ice-sdpfrag" body
        if it supports and uses RTP and RTCP multiplexing.
        The Trickle Answerer needs to follow the guidance on the usage of the "rtcp" attribute as given in
         <xref target="RFC8839" format="default"/> and
         <xref target="RFC3605" format="default"/>.
        Receipt of this attribute at the Offerer in an INFO request prior to the Answer
        indicates that the Answerer supports and uses RTP and RTCP multiplexing.
        The Offerer can use this information, e.g., for stopping the gathering of RTCP candidates
        and/or for freeing corresponding resources.

        This INFO request indicates that the Answerer supports and uses Media Multiplexing as well.
        Note that the Answerer only includes a single pseudo "m=" line since candidates
         matching those from the second "m=" line in the offer are not needed from the Answerer.
      </t>
      <t>
        The INFO request also indicates that the Answerer accepted the suggested Offerer BUNDLE address.
        This allows the Offerer to omit gathering RTP and RTCP candidates for the other "m=" lines
        or releasing already gathered candidates.
        If the INFO request did not contain the "group:BUNDLE" attribute, the Offerer has to gather
        RTP and RTCP  candidates for the other "m=" lines  unless it wants to wait until receipt
        of an Answer that eventually confirms
        support or non-support for Media Multiplexing.

        <name>Rationale -- Why INFO?</name>
        <t>
          The decision to use SIP INFO requests as a candidate transport
          method is based primarily on their lightweight nature. Once a
          dialog has been established, INFO requests can be exchanged
          both ways with no restrictions on timing and frequency and no
          risk of collision.
        </t>
        <t> A critical fact is that the sending of Trickle ICE candidates
        in one direction is entirely uncoupled from sending candidates
        in the other direction.
        Thus, the sending of candidates in each direction can be
        done by a stream of INFO requests that is not correlated with
        the stream of INFO requests in the other direction.
        And since each INFO request cumulatively includes
        the contents of all previous INFO requests in that direction,
        the ordering between INFO requests need not be preserved.
        All of this permits using largely independent INFO requests.
        </t>
        <t>
            Contrarily, UPDATE or other Offer/Answer mechanisms assume
            that the messages in each direction are tightly coupled
            with messages in the other direction.
            Using Offer/Answer and UPDATE requests
          <xref target="RFC3311" format="default"/>
          would introduce the following complications:
        </t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>Blocking of messages: </dt>
          <dd>
              Offer/Answer is defined as a
              strictly sequential mechanism in <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/>.
              There can only be a maximum of one active exchange
              at any point of time.
              Both sides cannot simultaneously send Offers nor
              can they generate multiple Offers prior to
              receiving an Answer.
              Using UPDATE requests for
              candidate transport would therefore imply the
              implementation of a candidate pool at every agent where
              candidates can be stored until it is once again that
              agent's "turn" to emit an Answer or a new Offer.
              Such an approach would introduce non-negligible
              complexity for no additional value.
            </dd>
          <dt>Elevated risk of glare: </dt>
          <dd>
              The sequential nature of Offer/Answer also makes it
              impossible for both sides to send Offers simultaneously.
              What's worse is that there are no mechanisms in SIP to
              actually prevent that. <xref target="RFC3261" format="default"/>, where
              the situation of Offers crossing on the wire is described
              as "glare", only defines a procedure for addressing the
              issue after it has occurred. According to that procedure,
              both Offers are invalidated and both sides need to retry
              the negotiation after a period between 0 and 4 seconds.

              The high likelihood for glare and the average two-second
              backoff intervals to occur implies that the duration of
              Trickle ICE processing would not only fail to improve but
              actually exceed those of regular ICE.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
          INFO messages decouple the exchange of candidates from the
          Offer/Answer negotiation
          and are subject to none of the glare issues described above,
          which makes them a very convenient and lightweight mechanism
          for asynchronous delivery of candidates.
        </t>
        <t>
          Using in-dialog INFO messages also provides a way of
          guaranteeing that candidates are delivered end to end, between
          the same entities that are actually in the process of
          initiating a session. Out-of-dialog alternatives would have implied
          requiring support for GRUU
          <xref target="RFC5627" format="default"/> that, given GRUUs relatively low
          adoption levels, would have constituted too strong of a
          constraint to the adoption of Trickle ICE.

          The purpose of the ICE protocol is to establish a media path

           part of this establishment.
        </t>
        <t>
          Candidates sent by a Trickle ICE Agent after the Offer
          follow the same signaling path and reach the same
          entity as the Offer itself. While it is true that GRUUs can
          be used to achieve this, one of the goals of this
          specification is to allow operation of Trickle ICE in as many
          environments as possible including those without GRUU support.

        Trickle ICE uses two mechanisms for the exchange of candidate information.
        This imposes new requirements to certain middleboxes
        that are used in some networks, e.g., for monitoring purposes.
        While the first mechanism, SDP Offers and Answers,
         is already used by regular ICE and is assumed to be supported,
          the second mechanism, INFO request bodies,
          needs to be considered by such middleboxes as well when
         trickle ICE is used.
         Such middleboxes need to make sure that they remain
         in the signaling path of the INFO requests and
         understand the INFO request body.

            UTF-8-encoded content might be introduced via extension attributes.
            The "charset" attribute may be used to signal the presence of other
            character sets in certain parts of a trickle-ice-sdpfrag body (see
            <xref target="RFC4566" format="default"/>).
