Abstract 
 
   Proxylets are small fragments of code installed on Open Pluggable 
   Edge Service (OPES) [1] intermediary, and executed when condition(s) 
   expressed using the Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) [2] 
   match. This document defines: 
   o    the Êproxylet:∆ URI [3] scheme used in the OPES framework 
   o    the OPES Meta-data Markup Language (OMML), an XML based 
        language used to describe proxylet characteristics

Internet Draft          Proxylet Naming scheme              March 2000 
 
 
1. Introduction 
    
   OPES enables network services that run on intermediary located in 
   the network, preferably at its edges. Proxylets are programs, 
   developed in a language tailored to the specific intermediary 
   element, which executes on the intermediary and performs actions 
   when a pre-defined condition or pre-defined sets of conditions are 
   met. These conditions are expressed as rules using IRML. Proxylets 
   can be pre-installed on the intermediaries through administrative 
   means, downloaded/fetched to/by the intermediaries or administration 
   devices using the proxylet meta-data.  
    
   This documents attempts to define the proxylet URI scheme as well as 
   meta-data defining proxylet characteristics. This meta-data will 
   facilitate interoperability between proxylet provider and user. 
    
   This document is organized as follows: 
    
   o   Section 2 describes the "proxylet:" URI scheme. 
    
   o   Section 3 and 4 describes the proxylet DTD (Document Type 
       Definition) [4] and syntax. 
    
   o   Section 5 describes usage examples.  
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS]. 
    
2. Proxylet URI scheme 
 
2.1. Syntax 
 
   The ABNF [5] grammar defined in the next section is the only 
   authoritative syntax definition for the proxylet URI scheme. 
    
   proxylet://[<server>]/[resource-path] 
    
2.2. ABNF Grammar 
 
   The full ABNF:  
    
   uri   = "proxylet:" "//" [server]["/" resource-path] 
    
   server = // as specified in RFC2396. In most cases Êlocalhost∆ will 
   be used to specify the server as proxylets will run locally. 
    
   resource-path names a specific resource within the server. 
 
3. OPES Meta-data Markup Language Grammar  
    
   The following XML DTD defines the OMML grammar.

   <!ELEMENT proxylet           (owner, info)> 
   <!ELEMENT owner             (name, id, version)> 
   <!ELEMENT name               (#PCDATA)> 
   <!ELEMENT id                 (#PCDATA)>

4. OMML Syntax 
    
   The corresponding OMML syntax follows the rules defined by [4].  
    
4.1. "proxyletInfo" element 
   The "proxyletInfo" element is the root element and MAY/MUST contain 
   the elements defined below. 
    
4.2. "owner" element 
    
   The "owner" element specifies the owner of the proxylet. Each 
   proxylet can have exactly one owner. 
    
4.2.1 Attribute of "owner" 
    
   Name         Value 
   ------------------ 
   description  CDATA  
    
   The "description" attribute gives descriptive explanation of the 
   service provided by the proxylet, e.g. virus checking, translation, 
   etc. 
    
4.2.2 "name" element 
    
   The "name" element provides a descriptive name for the proxylet∆s 
   owner. This can be a company name, a namespace, etc. The "name" 
   element doesn∆t have to be unique among proxylet providers.  
 
4.2.3 "id" element 
    
   The "id" element MUST contain a unique identifier for the proxylet 
   owner. The domain name of the proxylet owner MUST be used as the 
   proxylet "id". 
 
4.2.5 "version" element

Internet Draft          Proxylet Naming scheme              March 2000 
 
 
   The "version" attribute specifies the version of this proxylet. The 
   version format will use a series of digit separated by colon, e.g. 
   1.2.3.4.5  
    
4.3 Examples of the "owner", "name", "id", "version" elements 
    
   <?xml version="1.0"?> 
   <proxylet> 
      <owner description="Virus Checking Proxylet"> 
          <name>Intel Corp.</name> 
          <id>www.intel.com/developer/proxylet/vcheck</id> 
          <version>3.1.2.4.2</version> 
      </owner> 
   </proxylet> 
    
4.4 "info" element 
    
   The "info" element provides generic information and characteristics 
   about this proxylet that will be used by the OPES intermediary to 
   know where to get this proxylet, determine if it can support this 
   proxylet and what are this proxylet∆s requirements in terms of 
   protocols supported, execution binding. 
 
4.4.1 Attribute of "info" 
    
   Name         Value 
   ------------------ 
   date         CDATA 
   contact      CDATA 
    
   The "date" attributes specifies the proxylet creation date.  
    
   The "contact" attributes specifies a contact information for this 
   proxylet such as name, address, e-mail, phone number, etc. 
    
4.4.2 "location" element 
 
   The "location" element specifies the proxylet∆s fully qualified name 
   where the domain name might be different from the "id" element. For 
   example company A owns and develops the proxylet and so the "id" 
   element will be <id>A.com</id> but company A makes this proxylet 
                       rd
   available through a 3  party vendor B.com where OPES intermediary 
   will get the service from. The location element would be 
   <location>b.com\proxylet.pl<\location>. 
 
4.4.3 "protocol" element 
 
   The "protocol" element contains the name of the protocols attribute 
   supported by this proxylet. Other protocols than the ones defined in 
   the "protocol" element MUST NOT be given to the proxylet for 
   processing. For now only "http" is supported. Future version of this 
   document will support additional protocols.

Internet Draft          Proxylet Naming scheme              March 2000 
 
 
4.4.4 "modified-header" element 
 
   The "modified-header" element contains the name of a protocol header 
   that MAY be modified by the proxylet during processing. 
 
4.4.5 Attribute of "protocol" 
    
   Name                 Value 
   -------------------------- 
   name                 CDATA 
    
   The "name" attribute specifies the acronym of the supported protocol 
   by this proxylet. 
 
 
4.4.6 "exec-environment" element 
 
   The "exec-environment" element specifies the execution environment 
   required to run this proxylet. 
 
5. Example 
    
5.1. Proxylet information provided to an OPES Administration server. 
    
   <?xml version="1.0"?> 
   <proxylet> 
      <owner description="Language Translation Proxylet"> 
          <name>Intel Corp.</name> 
          <id>www.intel.com/developer/proxylet/translate</id> 
          <version>3.1.2.4.2</version> 
      </owner> 
      <info contact="J.D., Intel Corp., (213)555-1212"> 
          <location>www.any.com/proxylet/translate.class</location> 
          <protocol name="http"  
              <modified-header>content-type</modified-header> 
              <modified-header>accept-language</modified-header> 
          </protocol> 
          <exec-environment>java 2.0</exec-environment> 
      </info> 
   </proxylet> 
    
 
5.2. Proxylet information used by IRML. 
 
   IRML defines an action that will result in a proxylet being called 
   when the rule matches. The proxylet meta-data has been transferred 
   to / fetch by the intermediary along with the proxylet. 
    
   <?xml version="1.0"?> 
   <rule processing-point=3> 
     <property name="Content-Type" matches="text/html"> 
        <action>proxylet:\\localhost\translate.class/action> 
   </rule>

7. Security Considerations 
    
   Although beyond the scope of this document, it is clearly necessary 
   to define a secure mechanism for transferring OMML information and 
   proxylets to OPES administration servers or intermediaries. This 
   will include authenticating and authorizing OMML information and 
   proxylet providers and intermediaries. 
    
8. Intellectual Property
