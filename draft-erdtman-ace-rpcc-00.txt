     Raw-Public-Key and Pre-Shared-Key as OAuth client credentials
                       draft-erdtman-ace-rpcc-00

Abstract

   This document describes Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication
   using Raw-Public-Key and Pre-Shared-Key as new mechanisms for OAuth
   client authentication.  Although defined for TLS the mechanisms are
   equally applicable for DTLS.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication
   using Raw-Public-Key and Pre-Shared-Key as the mechanism for OAuth
   client authentication.  Examples of endpoint requiering client
   authentication are token and introspection.

   The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749] defines a shared
   secret method of client authentication but also allows for the
   definition and use of additional client authentication mechanisms
   when interacting with the authorization server's token endpoint.
   This document describes two additional mechanisms of client
   authentication utilizing Raw-Public-Key [RFC7250] and Pre-Shared-Key
   TLS [RFC4279], which provide better security characteristics than
   shared secrets.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Pre-Shared-Key for Client Authentication

   The following section defines, as an extension of OAuth 2.0,
   Section 2.3 [RFC6749], using Pre-Shared-Key with TLS [RFC4279] to
   authenticate the client.  This method is registered as
   'tls_client_psk' in "OAuth Token Endpoint Authentication Methods"
   registry.

   The (D)TLS handshake MUST be done according to [RFC4279], with the
   client indicating support for one or more Pre-Shared-Key cipher
   suites and authorization server selecting a Pre-Shared-Key cipher
   suite.  In order to enable authorization server to select the correct
   pre-shared-key the client MUST send its client identifier in the psk-
   identity field of the ClientKeyExchange message.  How the
   authorization server maps a client identifier to the pre-shared-key
   is out of scope for this specification.

   Note that the client identity MUST be 2^16 bytes or shorter, in order
   to fit into the psk-identity field.

3.  Raw-Public-Key for Client Authentication

   The following section defines, as an extension of OAuth 2.0,
   Section 2.3 [RFC6749], the use of Raw-Public-Key with (D)TLS
   [RFC7250] to authenticate the client.  This method is registered
   as'tls_client_rpk' in "OAuth Token Endpoint Authentication Methods"
   registry.

   The (D)TLS handshake MUST be done according to [RFC7250], with the
   client indicating support for Raw-Public-Key certificates and the
   authorization server asking client send its Raw Public Key
   certificate.  To enable authorization server to validate the client
   RPK it MUST send its client identifier in the ClientHello or
   ClientKeyExchange message.

   Authorization servers MAY use the following method to map a Raw
   Public Key to a client identifier: The client identifier is generated
   from the Raw Public Key using the procedure specified in section 3 of
   [RFC6920].  The digest is calculated on the Raw Public Key only (not
   on the SubjectPublicKeyInfo used in the handshake).  An example is
   shown in Figure 1.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Token Endpoint Authentication Method Registration

   This specification requests registration of the following value in
   the IANA "OAuth Token Endpoint Authentication Methods" registry
   [IANA.OAuth.Parameters] established by [RFC7591].

5.1.1.  Registry Contents

   o  Token Endpoint Authentication Method Name: "tls_client_rpk"
   o  Change Controller: IESG
   o  Specification Document(s): [[ this specification ]]

5.1.2.  Registry Contents

   o  Token Endpoint Authentication Method Name: "tls_client_psk"
   o  Change Controller: IESG
   o  Specification Document(s): [[ this specification ]]

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD
