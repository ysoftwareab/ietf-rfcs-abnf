  Establishing an Appropriate Root Zone DNSSEC Trust Anchor at Startup
               draft-jabley-dnsop-validator-bootstrap-00

Abstract

   Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) allow cryptographic
   signatures to be used to validate responses received from the Domain
   Name System (DNS).  A DNS client which validates such signatures is
   known as a validator.

   The choice of appropriate root zone trust anchor for a validator is
   expected to vary over time as the corresponding cryptographic keys
   used in DNSSEC are changed.

   This document provides guidance on how validators might determine an
   appropriate trust anchor for the root zone to use at start-up, or
   when other mechanisms intended to allow key rollover to be tolerated
   gracefully are not available.

2.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].
   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are described in [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034] and [RFC4035].

   The root zone of the DNS was signed using DNSSEC in July 2011, and
   many top-level domain registries have since signed their zones,
   installing secure delegations for them in the root zone.  A single
   trust anchor for the root zone is hence increasingly sufficient for
   validators.

   Validators are deployed in a variety of environments, and there is
   variation in the amount of system administration that might
   reasonably be expected to be available.  For example, embedded
   devices might never be administered by a human operator, whereas
   validators deployed on general-purpose operating systems in
   enterprise networks might have technical staff available to assist
   with their configuration.

   This document includes descriptions of mechanisms for validator
   bootstrapping, intended to be sufficient for embedded devices.  The
   implementation of those mechanisms might be automatic in the case of
   unattended devices, or manual, carried out by a systems
   administrator, depending on local circumstances.

   The choice of appropriate trust anchor for a DNSSEC Validator is
   expected to vary over time as the corresponding KSK used in the root
   zone is changed.  The DNSSEC Policy and Practice Statement (DPS) for
   the root zone KSK maintainer [KSK-DPS] specifies that scheduled KSK
   rollover will be undertaken according to the semantics specified in
   [RFC5011].  Validators which are able to recognise and accommodate
   those semantics should need no additional support to be able to
   maintain an appropriate trust anchor over a root zone KSK rollover
   event.

   The possibility remains, however, that [RFC5011] signalling will not
   be available to a validator: e.g. certain classes of emergency KSK
   rollover may require a compromised KSK to be discarded more quickly
   than [RFC5011] specifies, or a validator might be off-line over the
   whole key-roll event.

   This document provides guidance on how DNSSEC Validators might
   determine an appropriate set of trust anchors to use at start-up, or
   when other mechanisms intended to allow key rollover to be tolerated
   gracefully are not available.

   The bootstrapping procedures described in this document are also

   expected to be useful for a deployed, running validator which is not
   able to accommodate a KSK roll using [RFC5011] signalling.

3.  Summary of Approach

   A validator that has no valid trust anchor initialises itself as
   follows.

3.1.  Initial State

   A validator in its initial state is capable of sending and receiving
   DNS queries and responses, but is not capable of validating
   signatures received in responses.

   A validator must confirm that its local clock is sufficiently
   accurate before trust anchors can be established, and before
   processing of DNSSEC signatures can proceed.  Discussion of timing
   considerations can be found in Section 4.

3.2.  Trust Anchor Retrieval

   Once the local clock has been synchronised, a validator may proceed
   to gather candidate trust anchors for consideration.  Discussion of
   trust anchor retrieval can be found in Section 5.

3.3.  Trust Anchor Selection

   Once a set of candidate trust anchors has been obtained, a validator
   attempts to find one trust anchor in the set which is appropriate for
   use.  This process involves verification of cryptographic signatures,
   and is discussed in Section 6.

3.4.  Full Operation

   The validator now has an accurate trust anchor for the root zone, and
   is capable of validating signatures on responses from the DNS.

Internet-Draft             Validator Boostrap               January 2011


4.  Timing Considerations

   DNSSEC signatures are valid for particular periods of time, as
   specified by the administrator of the zone containing the signatures.
   It follows that any validator must maintain an accurate local clock
   in order to verify that signatures are accurate.

   Trust anchors correspond to KSKs in particular zones.  Zone
   administrators may choose to replace KSKs from time to time, e.g. due
   to a key compromise or local key management policy, and the
   corresponding appropriate choice in trust anchor will change as KSKs
   are replaced.

   Trust anchors for the root zone in particular are published with
   intended validity periods, as discussed in Section 5.  A validator
   making use of such trust anchors also requires an accurate local
   clock in order to avoid configuring a local trust anchor which
   corresponds to an old key.

   Validators should take appropriate steps to ensure that their local
   clocks are set with sufficient accuracy, and in the case where local
   clocks are set with reference to external time sources over a network
   [RFC5905] that the time information received from those sources is
   authentic.

5.  Retrieval of Candidate Trust Anchors

   Candidate trust anchors may be retrieved using several mechanisms.
   The process of gaining trust in particular candidate trust anchors
   before using them is discussed in Section 6.

5.1.  Retrieval of Trust Anchors from Local Sources

   A trust anchor which is packaged with validator software can never be
   trusted, since the corresponding root zone KSK may have rolled since
   the software was packaged, and the trust anchor may be derived from a
   root zone KSK that was retired due to compromise.

   Validators should never use local trust anchors for bootstrapping.

5.2.  Retrieval of Trust Anchors from the DNS

   The current root zone trust anchor is a hash (in DS RDATA format) of
   a member of the root zone apex DNSKEY RRSet that has the SEP bit set.
   Such a trust anchor could be derived from a response to the query ".
   IN DNSKEY?", but there is no mechanism available to trust the result:
   without an existing, accurate trust anchor the validator has no means
   to gauge the authenticity of the response.

   Validators should never derive trust anchors from DNSKEY RRSets
   obtained from the DNS.

5.3.  Retrieval of Trust Anchors from the Root Zone KSK Manager

   The Root Zone KSK Manager publishes trust anchors corresponding to
   the root zone KSK as described in [I-D.jabley-dnssec-trust-anchor].

   A full history of previously-published trust anchors, including the
   trust anchor recommended for immediate use, is made available in an
   XML document at the following stable URLs:

   o  <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml>

   o  <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml>

   Validity periods for each trust anchor packaged in the root-
   anchors.xml document are provided as XML attributes, allowing an
   appropriate trust anchor for immediate use to be identified (but see
   Section 4).

   Individual trust anchors are also packaged as X.509 identity
   certificates, signed by various Certificate Authorities (CAs).  URLs
   to allow those certificates to be retrieved are included as optional

   elements in the XML document.

   For automatic bootstrapping, the recommended approach is as follows.

   1.  Retrieve <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml>

   2.  Identify the trust anchors which are valid for current use, with
       reference to the current time and date.

   3.  Retrieve the corresponding X.509 identity certificates for the
       key identified in the previous step, for use in establishing
       trust in the retrieved trust anchor (see Section 6).

6.  Establishing Trust in Candidate Trust Anchors

   Once a candidate trust anchor has been retrieved, the validator must
   establish that it is authentic before it can be used.  This document
   recommends that this be carried out by checking the signatures on
   each of the X.509 identity certificates retrieved in the previous
   step until a certificate is found which matches a CA trust anchor.

   This verification phase requires that validators ship with a useful
   set of CA trust anchors, and that corresponding identity certificates
   are published by the root zone KSK manager.  In some cases validator
   implementors may decide to use commercial CA services, perhaps a
   subset of the "browser list" that is commonly distributed with web
   browsers; alternatively a vendor may instantiate its own CA and make
   arrangements with the root zone KSK manager to have the corresponding
   identity certificate locations published in root-anchors.xml.

   The CA trust anchors packaged with validators should have an expected
   lifetime in excess of the anticipated life of the validator.  As a
   protection against CA failure, validators are recommended to ship
   with more than one CA trust anchor.

7.  Failure to Locate a Valid Trust Anchor

   A validator that has failed to locate a valid trust anchor may re-try
   the retrieval and trust establishment phases indefinitely, but must
   not perform validation on DNS responses until a valid trust anchor
   has been identified.
