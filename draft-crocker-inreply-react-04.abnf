   The rule emoji_sequence is inherited from [Emoji-Seq].  It permits
   one or more bytes to form a single presentation image.

   The emoji(s) express a recipient's summary reaction to the specific
   message referenced by the accompanying In-Reply-To header field.
   [Mail-Fmt].

   Reference to unallocated code points SHOULD NOT be treated as an
   error; associated bytes SHOULD be processed using the system default
   method for denoting an unallocated or undisplayable code point.

   The presentation aspects of reaction processing are necessarily MUA-
   specific and beyond the scope of this specification.  In terms of the
   message itself, recipient MUAs that support this mechanism operate as
   follows:

   1.  If an In-Reply-To field is present check to see if it references
       a previous message the MUA has received.

   2.  If a reference to an existing message is found check for a part
       with a "reaction" content-disposition at either the outermost
       level or as part of a multipart at the outermost level.

   3.  If such a part is found, and the content of the part conforms to
       the restrictions outlined above, remove the part from the message
       and process it as a reaction.

   4.  Processing terminates if no parts remain in the message.  If
       parts remain process the remaining message content as a reply.

   Again, the handling of a message that has been successfully processed
   is MUA-specific and beyond the scope of this specification.
