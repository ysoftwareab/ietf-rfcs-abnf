Abstract 
    
   This document specifies the architectural characteristics, expected 
   behavior, textual representation, and usage of IPv6 addresses of 
   different scopes. 
    
    

1. Introduction 

    
   Internet Protocol version 6 includes support for addresses of 
   different "scope", that is, both global and non-global (e.g., link-
   local, site-local, etc.) addresses.  While non-global addressing has 
   been introduced operationally in the IPv4 Internet, both in the use 
   of private address space ("net 10", etc.) and with administratively 
   scoped multicast addresses, the design of IPv6 formally incorporates

   the notion of address scope into its base architecture.  This 
   document specifies the architectural characteristics, expected 
   behavior, textual representation, and usage of IPv6 addresses of 
   different scopes. 
    
    

2. Definitions 

    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119]. 
    
    

3. Basic Terminology 

    
   The terms link, interface, node, host, and router are defined in [RFC 
   2460].  The definitions of unicast address scopes (link-local, site-
   local, and global) and multicast address scopes (interface-local, 
   link-local, etc.) are contained in [ADDRARCH]. 
    
    

4. Address Scope 

    
   Every IPv6 address has a specific scope, that is, a topological span 
   within which the address may be used as a unique identifier for an 
   interface or set of interfaces.  The scope of an address is encoded 
   as part of the address, as specified in [ADDRARCH]. 
    
   For unicast addresses, there are three defined scopes: 
    
           o Link-local scope, for uniquely identifying interfaces 
              within (i.e., attached to) a single link only. 
    
           o Site-local scope, for uniquely identifying interfaces 
              within a single site only.  A "site" is, by intent, not 
              rigorously defined, but is typically expected to cover a 
              region of topology that belongs to a single organization 
              and is located within a single geographic location, such 
              as an office, an office complex, or a campus.  A personal 
              residence may be treated as a site (for example, when the 
              residence obtains Internet access via a public Internet 
              service provider), or as a part of a site (for example, 
              when the residence obtains Internet access via an 
              employer's or school's site). 
    
           o Global scope, for uniquely identifying interfaces anywhere 
              in the Internet. 
    
   The IPv6 unicast loopback address, ::1, is treated as having link-
   local scope within an imaginary link to which a virtual "loopback 
   interface" is attached.

   Anycast addresses [ADDRARCH] are allocated from the unicast address 
   space and have the same scope properties as unicast addresses.  All 
   statements in this document regarding unicast apply equally to 
   anycast. 
    
   For multicast addresses, there are fourteen possible scopes, ranging 
   from interface-local to global (including both link-local and site-
   local).  The interface-local scope spans a single interface only; a 
   multicast address of interface-local scope is useful only for 
   loopback delivery of multicasts within a single node, for example, as 
   a form of inter-process communication within a computer.  Unlike the 
   unicast loopback address, interface-local multicast addresses may be 
   assigned to any interface. 
    
   There is a size relationship among scopes: 
    
           o for unicast scopes, link-local is a smaller scope than 
              site-local, and site-local is a smaller scope than global. 
    
           o for multicast scopes, scopes with lesser values in the 
              "scop" subfield of the multicast address [ADDRARCH, 
              section 2.7] are smaller than scopes with greater values, 
              with interface-local being the smallest and global being 
              the largest. 
    
   However, two scopes of different size may cover the exact same region 
   of topology. For example, a site may consist of a single link, in 
   which both link-local and site-local scope effectively cover the same 
   topological span. 
    
    

5. Scope Zones 

    
   A scope zone, or a simply a zone, is a connected region of topology 
   of a given scope.  For example, the set of links connected by routers 
   within a particular site, and the interfaces attached to those links, 
   comprise a single zone of site-local scope. Note that a zone is a 
   particular instance of a topological region (e.g., Alice∆s site or 
   Bob∆s site), whereas a scope is the size of a topological region 
   (i.e., a site or a link or a ...). 
    
   The zone to which a particular non-global address pertains is not 
   encoded in the address itself, but rather is determined by context, 
   such as the interface from which it is sent or received.  Thus, 
   addresses of a given (non-global) scope may be re-used in different 
   zones of that scope.  For example, Alice's site and Bob's site may 
   each contain a node with site-local address fec0::1. 
    
   Zones of the different scopes are instantiated as follows:

Internet Draft     IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture         March 2001 
    
           o Each interface on a node comprises a single zone of 
              interface-local scope (for multicast only). 
    
           o Each link, and the interfaces attached to that link, 
              comprises a single zone of link-local scope (for both 
              unicast and multicast). 
 
           o There is a single zone of global scope (for both unicast 
              and multicast), comprising all the links and interfaces in 
              the Internet. 
    
           o The boundaries of zones of scope other than interface-
              local, link-local, and global must be defined and 
              configured by network administrators.  A site boundary 
              serves as such for both unicast and multicast. 
    
   Zone boundaries are relatively static features, not changing in 
   response to short-term changes in topology.  Thus, the requirement 
   that the topology within a zone be "connected" is intended to include 
   links and interfaces that may be only occasionally connected.  For 
   example, a residential node or network that obtains Internet access 
   by dial-up to an employer's site may be treated as part of the 
   employer's site-local zone even when the dial-up link is 
   disconnected.  Similarly, a failure of a router, interface, or link 
   that causes a zone to become partitioned does not split that zone 
   into multiple zones; rather, the different partitions are still 
   considered to belong to the same zone. 
    
   Zones have the following additional properties: 
    
           o Zone boundaries cut through nodes, not links.  (Note that 
              the global zone has no boundary, and the boundary of an 
              interface-local zone encloses just a single interface.) 
    
           o Zones of the same scope cannot overlap, i.e., they can 
              have no links or interfaces in common. 
    
           o A zone of a given scope (less than global) falls 
              completely within zones of larger scope, i.e., a smaller 
              scope zone cannot include more topology than any larger 
              scope zone with which it shares any links or interfaces. 
    
   Each interface belongs to exactly one zone of each possible scope. 
    
    

6. Zone Indices 

    
   Considering the fact that the same non-global address may be in use 
   in more than one zone of the same scope (e.g., the use of site-local 
   address fec0::1 in both Alice's site and Bob's site), and that a node 
   may have interfaces attached to different zones of the same scope

   (e.g., having one interface attached to Alice's site and another to 
   Bob's site), a node requires an internal means of identifying to 
   which zone a non-global address belongs.  This is accomplished by 
   assigning, within the node, a distinct "zone index" to each zone of 
   the same scope to which that node is attached, and allowing all 
   internal uses of an address to be qualified by a zone index. 
    
   The assignment of zone indices is illustrated in the example in the 
   figure below:

     |                                                               |

         (imaginary    =================      a point-       a 
          loopback        an Ethernet         to-point     tunnel 
            link)                               link 
      
                       Figure 1 : Zone Indices Example 
    
    
   This example node has five interfaces: 
    
           o A loopback interface to the imaginary loopback link (a 
              phantom link that goes nowhere), 
    
           o Two interfaces to the same Ethernet, 
    
           o An interface to a point-to-point link, and 
    
           o A tunnel interface (e.g., the abstract endpoint of an 
              IPv6-over-IPv6 tunnel [RFC 2473], presumably established 
              over either the Ethernet or the point-to-point link.) 
    
   It is thus attached to five interface-local zones, identified by the 
   interface indices 1 through 5. 
    
   Because the two Ethernet interfaces are attached to the same link, 
   the node is attached to only four link-local zones, identified by 
   link indices 1 through 4.

   It is attached to two site-local zones: one to which the loopback 
   link, the Ethernet, and the point-to-point link belong, and one to 
   which the tunnel belongs (perhaps because it is a tunnel to another 
   organization).  These site-local zones are identified by the site 
   indices 1 and 2. 
    
   Note that each attached zone of the same scope must be assigned a 
   different index value, whereas attached zones of different scopes can 
   re-use the same index. 
    
   The zone indices are strictly local to the node.  For example, the 
   node on the other end of the point-to-point link may well be using 
   entirely different interface, link, and site index values for that 
   link. 
    
   An implementation should also support the concept of a "default" zone 
   for each scope.  It is convenient to reserve the index value zero, at 
   each scope, to mean "use the default zone".  This default index can 
   also be used as the zone qualifier for an address for which the node 
   is attached to only one zone, e.g., when using global addresses. 
    
   There is at present no way for a node to automatically determine 
   which of its interfaces belong to the same zones, e.g., the same link 
   or the same site.  In the future, protocols may be developed to 
   determine that information.  In the absence of such protocols, an 
   implementation must provide a means for manual assignment and/or 
   reassignment of zone indices.  Furthermore, to avoid the need to 
   perform manual configuration in most cases, an implementation should, 
   by default, initially assign zone indices as follows, and only as 
   follows: 
    
           o A unique interface index for each interface 
    
           o A unique link index for each interface 
 
           o A unique subnet (multicast "scop" value 3) index for each 
              interface 
    
   Then, manual configuration would be necessary only for the less 
   common cases of nodes with multiple interfaces to a single link or a 
   single subnet, interfaces to different sites, or interfaces to zones 
   of different (multicast-only) scopes. 
    
   Thus, the default zone index assignments for the example node from 
   Figure 1 would be as illustrated in Figure 2, below.  Manual 
   configuration would then be required to, for example, assign the same 
   link index to the two Ethernet interfaces as shown in Figure 1.

                 Figure 2 : Example of Default Zone Indices 
    
   As well as initially assigning zone indices, as specified above, an 
   implementation should automatically select a default zone for each 
   scope for which there is more than one choice, to be used whenever an 
   address is specified without a zone index (or with a zone index of 
   zero).  For instance, in the example shown in Figure 2, the 
   implementation might automatically select intf2, link2, and subnet2 
   as the default zones for each of those three scopes.  (Perhaps the 
   selection algorithm is to choose the first zone that includes an 
   interface other than the loopback interface as the default for each 
   scope.)  A means must also be provided for manually assigning the 
   default zone for a scope, overriding any automatic assignment. 
    
     Because the unicast loopback address, ::1, may not be assigned to 
     any interface other than the loopback interface, it is recommended 
     that whenever ::1 is specified without a zone index, or with the 
     default zone index, that it be interpreted as belonging to the 
     loopback link-local zone, regardless of which link-local zone has 
     been selected as the default.  If this is done, then in the common 
     case of nodes with only a single non-loopback interface (e.g., a 
     single Ethernet interface), it becomes possible to avoid any need 
     to qualify link-local addresses with a zone index: the unqualified 
     address ::1 would always refer to the link-local zone containing 
     the loopback interface, and all other unqualified link-local 
     addresses would refer to the link-local zone containing the non-
     loopback interface (as long as the default link-local zone were set 
     to be the zone containing the non-loopback interface). 
      
   Because of the requirement that a zone of a given scope fall 
   completely within zones of larger scope (see section 5, above), if 
   two interfaces are assigned to different zones of scope S, they must

Internet Draft     IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture         March 2001 
    
   also be assigned to different zones of all scopes smaller than S.  
   Thus, the manual assignment of distinct zone indices for one scope 
   may require the automatic assignment of distinct zone indices for 
   smaller scopes.  For example, the manual assignment of distinct site-
   local indices 1 and 2 in the node in Figure 1 would cause the 
   automatic creation of corresponding admin-local (i.e. multicast 
   "scop" value 4) indices 1 and 2, because admin-local scope is smaller 
   than site-local scope. 
    
   Taking all of the above considerations in account, the complete set 
   of zone indices for our example node from Figure 1 is shown in Figure 
   3, below.

   Although the examples above show the zones being assigned index 
   values sequentially, starting at one, the zone index values are 
   arbitrary.  An implementation may use any value it chooses to label a 
   zone as long as it meets the requirement that the index value of each 
   attached zone of the same scope be unique within the node.  
   Similarly, an implementation may choose an index value other than 
   zero to represent the default zone.  Implementations choosing to 
   follow the recommended basic API [RFC 2553] will want to restrict 
   their index values to those that can be represented by the 
   sin6_scope_id field of a sockaddr_in6. 
 
          (Authors' note to selves:  The Working Group seemed to be 
          in favor of allowing all zone indices for all scopes to

          have unique values in a sin6 scope id field, e.g., by 
          using the first four bits of the scope id to identify the 
          scope [using the same encoding as the scop field in 
          multicast addresses], and placing the zone id in the 
          remaining 28 bits.  This would probably be best specified 
          the advanced API spec, rather than here.) 
    

7. Sending Packets 

    
   When an upper-layer protocol sends a packet to a non-global 
   destination address, it must have a means of identifying to the IPv6 
   layer the intended zone, for cases in which the node is attached to 
   more than one zone of the destination address's scope. 
    
   Although identification of an outgoing interface is sufficient to 
   identify an intended zone (because each interface is attached to no 
   more than one zone of each scope), that is more specific than desired 
   in many cases.  For example, when sending to a site-local unicast 
   address, from a node that has more than one interface to the intended 
   site, the upper layer protocol may not care which of those interfaces 
   is used for the transmission, but rather would prefer to leave that 
   choice to the routing function in the IP layer.  Thus, the upper-
   layer requires the ability to specify a zone index, rather than an 
   interface identifier, when sending to a non-global, non-loopback 
   destination address. 
    
    
    

8. Receiving Packets 

    
   When an upper-layer protocol receives a packet containing a non-
   global source or destination address, the zone to which that address 
   pertains can be determined from the arrival interface, because the 
   arrival interface can be attached to only one zone of the same scope 
   as the address under consideration.  However, it is recommended that 
   the IP layer convey to the upper layer the correct zone indices for 
   the arriving source and destination addresses, in addition to the 
   arrival interface identifier. 
    
    

9. Forwarding 

    
   When a router receives a packet addressed to a node other than 
   itself, it must take the zone of the destination and source addresses 
   into account as follows: 
    
           o The zone of the destination address is determined by the 
              scope of the address and arrival interface of the packet.  
              The next-hop interface is chosen by looking up the 
              destination address in a (conceptual) routing table 


  
Deering, Haberman, Jinmei, Nordmark, Onoe, Zill                      9 
    

 
Internet Draft     IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture         March 2001 
    
              specific to that zone.  That routing table is restricted 
              to refer only to interfaces belonging to that zone. 
    
           o After the next-hop interface is chosen, the zone of the 
              source address is considered.  As with the destination 
              address, the zone of the source address is determined by 
              the scope of the address and arrival interface of the 
              packet.  If transmitting the packet on the chosen next-hop 
              interface would cause the packet to leave the zone of the 
              source address, i.e., cross a zone boundary of the scope 
              of the source address, then the packet is discarded and an 
              ICMP Destination Unreachable message [RFC 2463] with Code 
              2 ("beyond scope of source address") is sent to the source 
              of the packet. 
    
   Note that the above procedure applies for addresses of all scopes, 
   including link-local.  Thus, if a router receives a packet with a 
   link-local destination address that is not one of the router's own 
   link-local addresses on the arrival link, the router is expected to 
   try to forward the packet to the destination on that link (subject to 
   successful determination of the destination's link-layer address via 
   the Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC 2461]). The forwarded packet may 
   be transmitted back out the arrival interface, or out any other 
   interface attached to the same link. 
    
   A node that receives a packet addressed to itself and containing a 
   Routing Header with more than zero Segments Left [RFC 2460, section 
   4.4] swaps the original destination address with the next address in 
   the Routing Header.  Then the above forwarding rules are applied, 
   using the new destination address where the zone of the new 
   destination address should be determined by the scope of the previous 
   destination address and the interface to which the previous address 
   belongs (which is not necessarily equal to the incoming interface).  
   An implementation MUST NOT examine additional addresses in the 
   Routing header to determine whether they are crossing boundaries for 
   their scopes.  Thus, it is possible, though generally inadvisable, to 
   use a Routing Header to convey a non-global address across its 
   associated zone boundary. 
    
    

10. Routing 

    
   When a routing protocol determines that it is operating on a zone 
   boundary, it MUST protect inter-zone integrity and maintain intra-
   zone connectivity. 
    
   In order to maintain connectivity, the routing protocol must be able 
   to create forwarding information for the global prefixes as well as 
   for all of the zone prefixes for each of its attached zones.  The 
   most straightforward way of doing this is to create (conceptual) 
   forwarding tables for each specific zone. 

  
Deering, Haberman, Jinmei, Nordmark, Onoe, Zill                     10 
    

 
Internet Draft     IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture         March 2001 
    
    
   To protect inter-zone integrity, routers must be selective in the 
   prefix information that is shared with neighboring routers.  Routers 
   routinely exchange routing information with neighboring routers.  
   When a router is transmitting this routing information, it must not 
   include any information about zones other than the zones assigned to 
   the interface used to transmit the information.

   As an example, the router in Figure 4 must exchange routing 
   information on five interfaces.  The information exchanged is as 
   follows: 
    
           o Interface 1 
    
              o All global prefixes 
      
              o All site prefixes learned from Interfaces 1, 2, and 3 
    
           o Interface 2 
    
              o All global prefixes 
      
              o All site prefixes learned from Interfaces 1, 2, and 3 
    
           o Interface 3 
    
              o All global prefixes

   By imposing route exchange rules, zone integrity is maintained by 
   keeping all zone-specific routing information contained within the 
   zone. 
    
    

11. Mobility 

    
    A mobile node that moves outside its "home site" must maintain the 
   "home site-local addresses" for continued communication with nodes in 
   its "home site".  This implies that such a mobile node conceptually 
   will have one interface (for the traffic destined to and from its 
   home site) which is assigned the home site-local addresses in 
   addition to its other interfaces which might be part of the visited 
   site. 
    
   A mobile node may choose to autoconfigure site-local addresses in the 
   visited site.  However, such addresses add complexity to the mobile 
   node with little or no benefit.  Thus it is recommended that mobile 
   nodes only autoconfigure global addresses when moving to links 
   outside its home site. 
    
   A mobile node needs to be able to detect when it has moved to a 
   different site.  Thus in addition to the regular movement detection 
   in [MOBILE] it should inspect the site prefixes in the Router 
   Advertisement messages to determine when it is outside its home site.

          mobility aspects) 
    

12. Textual Representation 

    
   As already mentioned, to specify an IPv6 non-global address without 
   ambiguity, an intended scope zone should be specified as well.  As a 
   common notation to specify the scope zone, an implementation SHOULD 
   support the following format. 
    

  
Deering, Haberman, Jinmei, Nordmark, Onoe, Zill                     12 
    

 
Internet Draft     IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture         March 2001 
    
         <address>%<zone_id> 
          
      where 
         <address> is a literal IPv6 address, 
         <zone_id> is a string to identify the scope zone of the 
         address, and 
         `%' is a delimiter character to distinguish between <address> 
         and <zone_id>. 
      
   The following subsections describe detail definitions, concrete 
   examples, and additional notes of the format. 
    

  12.1 Non-Global Addresses 

    
   The format is applied to all kinds of unicast and multicast addresses 
   of non-global scope.  Although the format is meaningless and should 
   not be used for global addresses, an implementation which handles 
   addresses (e.g. name to address mapping functions) MAY allow users to 
   use such a notation. 
    

  12.2 Zone Indices 

    
   An implementation SHOULD support at least numerical indices as 
   <zone_id>, which are non-negative decimal integers.  Positive indices 
   MUST uniquely specify a single zone for a given address.  An 
   implementation MAY use zero ("0") to specify a "default" zone as 
   described in Section 6 of this document. 
    
   An implementation MAY support other kinds of non-null strings as 
   <zone_id>.  However, the strings must not conflict with the delimiter 
   character.  The precise semantics of such additional strings is 
   implementation dependent. 
    
   One possible candidate of such strings would be interface names, 
   since interfaces uniquely disambiguate any type of scopes.  In 
   particular, if an implementation can assume that there is a one-to-
   one mapping between links and interfaces (and the assumption is 
   usually reasonable,) using interface names as link indices would be 
   natural. 
    
   An implementation could also use interface names as <zone_id> for 
   larger scopes than links, but there might be some confusion in such 
   use.  For example, when more than one interface belongs to a same 
   site, a user would be confused about which interface should be used.  
   Also, a mapping function from an address to a name would encounter a 
   same kind of problem, when it prints an address with an interface 
   name as a zone index.  This document does not specify how these cases 
   should be treated and leaves it implementation dependent. 
    



  
Deering, Haberman, Jinmei, Nordmark, Onoe, Zill                     13 
    

 
Internet Draft     IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture         March 2001 
    
   It cannot be assumed that a same index is common to all nodes in a 
   zone (see Section 6).  Hence, the format MUST be used only within a 
   node and MUST NOT be sent on a wire. 
    

  12.3 Examples 

    
   Here are examples.  The following addresses 
    
         fe80::1234 (whose link index is 1) 
         fec0::5678 (whose site index is 2) 
         ff02::9abc (whose link index is 5) 
         ff08::def0 (whose organization index is 10) 
    
   would be represented as follows: 
    
         fe80::1234%1 
         fec0::5678%2 
         ff02::9abc%5 
         ff08::def0%10 
    
   If we use interface names as <zone_id>, those addresses could also be 
   represented as follows: 
    
         fe80::1234%ne0 
         fec0::5678%ether2 
         ff02::9abc%pvc1.3 
         ff08::def0%interface10 
    
   where the interface "ne0" belongs to link 1, "ether2" belongs to site 
   2, and so on. 
    

  12.4 Usage Examples 

    
   Applications that are supposed to be used in end hosts like telnet, 
   ftp, and ssh, may not explicitly support the notion of address scope, 
   especially of link-local addresses.  However, an expert user (e.g. a 
   network administrator) sometimes has to give even link-local 
   addresses to such applications. 
    
   Here is a concrete example. Consider a multi-linked router, called 
   "R1", that has at least two point-to-point interfaces (links).  Each 
   of the interfaces is connected to another router, called "R2" and 
   "R3", respectively.  Also assume that the point-to-point interfaces 
   are "unnumbered", that is, they have link-local addresses only. 
    
   Now suppose that the routing system on R2 hangs up and has to be 
   reinvoked.  In this situation, we may not be able to use a global 
   address of R2, because this is a routing trouble and we cannot expect 
   that we have enough routes for global reachability to R2. 
    


  
Deering, Haberman, Jinmei, Nordmark, Onoe, Zill                     14 
    

 
Internet Draft     IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture         March 2001 
    
   Hence, we have to login R1 first, and then try to login R2 using 
   link-local addresses.  In such a case, we have to give the link-local 
   address of R2 to, for example, telnet.  Here we assume the address is 
   fe80::2. 
    
   Note that we cannot just type like 
    
         % telnet fe80::2 
    
   here, since R1 has more than one link and hence the telnet command 
   cannot detect which link it should try to connect.  Instead, we 
   should type the link-local address with the link index as follows: 
    
         % telnet fe80::2%3 
    
   where 3 after the delimiter character `%' is the link index of the 
   point-to-point link. 
    
   Another example is an EBGP peering.  When two IPv6 ISPs establish an 
   EBGP peering, using a particular ISP's global addresses for the peer 
   would be unfair, and using their link-local addresses would be better 
   in a neutral IX.  In such a case, link-local addresses should be 
   specified in a router's configuration file and the link for the 
   addresses should be disambiguated, since a router usually connects to 
   multiple links. 
    

  12.5 Related API 

    
   The "Basic Socket API" [BASICAPI] defines how the format for non-
   global addresses should be treated in library functions that 
   translate a nodename to an address, or vice versa. 
    

  12.6 Omitting Zone Indices 

    
   The format defined in this document does not intend to invalidate the 
   original format for non-global addresses, that is, the format without 
   the scope index portion.  An implementation SHOULD rather provide a 
   user with a "default" zone of each scope and allow the user to omit 
   zone indices in textual representations. 
    
   Also, when an implementation can assume that there is no ambiguity of 
   any type of scopes on a node, it MAY even omit the whole 
   functionality to handle the format.  An end host with a single 
   interface would be an example of such a case. 
    

  12.7 Combinations of Delimiter Characters 

    
   There are other kinds of delimiter characters defined for IPv6 
   addresses.  In this subsection, we describe how they should be 
   combined with the format for non-global addresses.

   The IPv6 addressing architecture [ADDRARCH] also defines the syntax 
   of IPv6 prefixes.  If the address portion of a prefix is non-global 
   and its scope zone should be disambiguated, the address portion 
   SHOULD be in the format.  For example, the prefix fec0:0:0:1::/64 on 
   a site whose index is 2 should be represented as follows: 
    
         fec0:0:0:1::%2/64 
    
   In this combination, it is important to place the zone index portion 
   before the prefix length, when we consider parsing the format by a 
   name-to-address library function [RFC2553BIS].  That is, we can first 
   separate the address with the zone index from the prefix length, and 
   just pass the former to the library function. 
    
   The preferred format for literal IPv6 addresses in URL's are also 
   defined [RFC 2732].  When a user types the preferred format for an 
   IPv6 non-global address whose zone should be explicitly specified, 
   the user could use the format for the non-global address combined 
   with the preferred format. 
    
   However, the typed URL is often sent on a wire, and it would cause 
   confusion if an application did not strip the <zone_id> portion 
   before sending.  Also, the format for non-global addresses might 
   conflict with the URI syntax [RFC 2396], since the syntax defines the 
   delimiter character (`%') as the escape character. 
    
   Hence, this document does not specify how the format for non-global 
   addresses should be combined with the preferred format for literal 
   IPv6 addresses.  As for the conflict issue with the URI format, it 
   would be better to wait until the relationship between the preferred 
   format and the URI syntax is clarified.  In fact, the preferred 
   format for IPv6 literal addresses itself has same kind of conflict.  
   In any case, it is recommended to use an FQDN instead of a literal 
   IPv6 address in a URL, whenever an FQDN is available.

14. Security Considerations 

    
   The routing section of this document specifies a set of guidelines 
   that allow routers to prevent zone-specific information from leaking 
   out of each site.  If site boundary routers allow site routing 
   information to be forwarded outside of the site, the integrity of the 
   site could be compromised. 
    
   Since the use of the textual representation of non-global addresses 
   is restricted within a single node, it does not create a security 
   vulnerability from outside the node.  However, a malicious node might 
   send a packet that contains a textual IPv6 non-global address with a 
   zone index, intending to deceive the receiving node about the zone of 
   the non-global address.  Thus, an implementation should be careful 
   when it receives packets that contain textual non-global addresses as 
   data.
