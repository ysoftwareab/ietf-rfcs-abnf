                    IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Header Handling
                 draft-ietf-6man-hbh-header-handling-00

Abstract

   This note updates the IPv6 Specification (RFC 2460), specifically
   commenting on the Hop-by-Hop Options Header (section 4.3) and option
   format and handling (section 4.2).

   It also updates RFC 7045, which noted that RFC 2460 is widely
   violated in this respect, but merely legitimized this situation with
   a SHOULD.  The present document tries to address the issue more
   fundamentally.

1.  Introduction

   The IPv6 Specification [RFC2460] specifies a number of extension
   headers.  These, and the ordering considerations given, were defined
   based on experience with IPv4 options.  They were, however, prescient
   with respect to their actual use - the IETF community did not know
   how they would be used.  In at least one case, the Hop-by-Hop option,
   most if not all implementations implement it by punting to a software
   path.  In the words of [RFC7045],

      The IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options header SHOULD be processed by
      intermediate forwarding nodes as described in [RFC2460].  However,
      it is to be expected that high-performance routers will either
      ignore it or assign packets containing it to a slow processing
      path.  Designers planning to use a Hop-by-Hop option need to be
      aware of this likely behaviour.

   Fernando Gont, in his Observations on IPv6 EH Filtering in the Real
   World [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-in-real-world], and the operational
   community in IPv6 Operations, consider any punt to a software path to
   be an attack vector.  Hence, IPv6 packets containing the Hop-by-Hop
   Extension Header (and in some cases, any extension header) get
   dropped in transit.

   The subject of this document is implementation approaches to obviate
   or mitigate the attack vector, and updating the Hop-by-Hop option
   with respect to current issues.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Handling of options in extension headers

   Packets containing the Hop-by-Hop Extension Header SHOULD be
   processed at substantially the same rate as packets that do not.

   If a hop-by-hop header option is not implemented, or is not in use,
   in a given system (such as, for example, an interface that is not
   configured for RSVP receiving an RSVP Alert Option), the option MUST
   be skipped.

   If a hop-by-hop header is present in a packet's extension header
   chain and it is not the first extension header, the packet MUST be
   discarded by the first system that observes the fact (Section 2.2 of
   [RFC7045]).  This will normally be in the system using the IPv6
   address in the Destination Address, as [RFC2460] precludes other
   routers from parsing the header chain.  The only obvious exception to
   that is a router or firewall configured to parse the IPv6 header
   chain.

2.1.  Hop-by_hop Options

   At this writing, there are several defined Hop-by-Hop options:

   PAD Options:  The PAD1 and PADn options [RFC2460] define empty space.

   Router Alert Option:  The IPv6 Router Alert Option [RFC2711]
      [RFC6398] is intended to force the punting of a datagram to
      software, in cases in which RSVP or other protocols need that to
      happen.

   Jumbo Payload:  Carries a length field for a packet whose length
      exceeds 0xFFFF octets.  [RFC2675]

   RPL Option:  The RPL option carries routing information used in a RPL
      network[RFC6553]

   Quickstart Option  Identifies TCP quick-start configuration, and
      allows an intermediate router to reduce the configuration
      parameters as appropriate.  [RFC4782]

   Common Architecture Label IPv6 Security Option:  Encodes security
      labels on packets [RFC5570]

   SMF Option:  Simplified Multicast Forwarding Option[RFC6621]

   MPL Option:  Supports multicast in an RPL network
      [I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast]

   DFF Option:  Depth-First Forwarding [RFC6971]

   There are also options that have been defined for the Destination
   Options header.  These are not listed here.

   While this is not true of older implementations, modern equipment is
   capable of parsing the Extension Header chain, and can be extended to
   perform at least a cursory examination of the Hop-by-Hop options.
   For example, such implementations SHOULD be able to identify and skip
   the PAD1 and PADn options, and perform more complicated processing
   only if configured by software to do so.  More to the point: it isn't
   clear what the purpose of the JumboFrame option is if not to be
   understood by anyone that looks at it.

      Question asked by a reviewer: "Is this configurable?  How will
      router know that HbH needs to be skipped on one interface and not
      on others."

      Answer: the system knows whether RSVP has been configured on an
      interface.  When such configuration is present, it can configure
      the hardware with what it wants done with the Router Alert.  In
      the absence of such configuration, hardware should be configured
      to skip the option if found.

2.2.  Changing options in transit

   Section 4.2 of [RFC2460] explicitly allows for options that may be
   updated in transit.  It is likely that the original authors intended
   that to be very simple, such as having the originating end system
   provide the container, and having intermediate systems update it -
   perhaps performing some calculation, and in any event storing the
   resulting value.  Examples of such a use might be in [XCP] or [RCP].

   As a side comment, the Routing Header, which is an extension header
   rather than a list of options, is treated similarly; when a system is
   the destination of a packet and not the last one in the Routing



Baker                      Expires May 6, 2016                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                                             November 2015


   Header's list, it swaps the destination address with the indicated
   address in the list, and updates the hop count and the list depth
   accordingly.

   Such options must be marked appropriately (their option type is of
   the form XX1XXXXX), and are excluded from checksum calculations in AH
   and ESP.

2.3.  Adding headers or options in transit

   Use cases under current consideration take this a step further: a
   router or middleware process MAY add an extension header, MAY add an
   option to the header, which may extend the length of the Hop-by-Hop
   Extension Header, or MAY process such an option in a manner that
   extends both the length of the option and the Extension Header
   containing it.  The obvious implication is that other equipment in
   the network may not understand or implement the new option type.  As
   such, the Option Type value of such an option MUST indicate that it
   is to be skipped by a system that does not understand it.  Since, by
   definition, it is being updated in transit and not included in any AH
   or ESP integrity check if present, the Option Type MUST also indicate
   that it may be updated in transit, and so is excluded from AH and ESP
   processing.  By implication, such an Option Type MUST be of the form
   001XXXXX.

2.4.  Interactions with the Security Extension Header

   The interactions with the IP Authentication Header [RFC4302] and IP
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303], as in the case of
   existing option uses, is minimally defined.  AH and ESP call for the
   exclusion of mutable data in their calculations by zeroing it out
   prior to performing the integrity check calculation.  However, in the
   case that network operation has changed the length of the option or
   the extension header, that may still cause the integrity check to
   fail.  Specifications that define such options SHOULD consider the
   implications of this for AH and ESP.  An option whose insertion would
   affect the integrity check MUST be removed prior to the integrity
   check, and as a result the packet restored to its state as originally
   sent.

3.  Interoperation with RFC 2460

   There are four possible modes of interaction with routers that don't
   implement the Hop-By-Hop Option in the fast path:

   1.  Presume that they cannot handle the Hop-By-Hop option at close to
       wire speed, and that's OK.

Internet-Draft                                             November 2015


   2.  Presume that they will drop traffic containing Hop-By-Hop
       options.

   3.  Presume that they can handle the Hop-By-Hop option at or close to
       wire speed, and are configured to do so.

   4.  Presume that they don't exist, perhaps because older routers are
       configured to ignore all Hop-by-Hop options.

   If the first model actually works in a given network, it may be
   acceptable in that domain.  It is not a model that will work in the
   general Internet, however.

   The second model (which is most probable at this writing) is a
   description of the general Internet in 2015.

   The third and fourth models, if applicable in a given context, are
   what one might hope for.  Vendors are in a position to either have an
   option to ignore the Hop-By-Hop header in older equipment, or add
   such an option in upgraded software (fourth model).  New equipment is
   expected to follow the third model by implementing the
   recommendations in Section 2.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo asks the IANA for no new parameters.

5.  Security Considerations

   In general, modification of a datagram in transit is considered very
   closely from the viewpoint of the End-to-End Principle, which in this
   context may be summarized as "the network should do nothing that is
   of concern to the communicating applications or introduces
   operational issues."  The concept of changing the length of an
   Extension Header or an option contained within it (Section 2.3) is of
   concern in that context.  The obvious concern is around the
   interaction with AH or ESP, and a less obvious concern relates to
   Path MTU, which might change if the size of an underlying header
   changes.  Section 2.4 is intended to mitigate that issue.  However,
   some ramifications, such as with Path MTU, may not be completely
   solvable in the general Internet, but require use cases to be
   confined to a network or set of consenting networks.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   Data formats in this memo reveal no personally identifying
   information.
