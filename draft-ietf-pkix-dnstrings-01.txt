ABSTRACT

RFC 2253 [2] standardises a set of strings that can be used to 
represent attribute types in LDAP distinguished names. This list is 
does not cover the full set of attribute types used in the 
distinguished names of issuers and subjects in public key 
certificates. This document standardises the strings needed for these 
additional attribute types. It also defines the Permanent Identifier 
attribute type which may be used to identify objects.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


1. Introduction

X.501 [9] defines distinguished names in ASN.1 [10], where each 
attribute type of a RDN is identified using an object identifier. The 
encoding of distinguished names is both verbose and non-user 
friendly. RFC 2253 [2] standardises a set of strings for a limited 
number of attribute types that can be used in the LDAP encoding of 
X.500 distinguished names. This makes the LDAP encoding of 
distinguished names more compact and user friendly. The limited 
number of attribute types was initially chosen as they were thought 
to be sufficient for building a global DIT. These attribute types 
are:

                    String  X.500 AttributeType
                    ------------------------------
  CN      commonName
                    L       localityName
                    ST      stateOrProvinceName
                    O       organizationName
                    OU      organizationalUnitName
                    C       countryName
                    STREET  streetAddress
                    DC      domainComponent
                    UID     userid

RFC 2253 made provision for additional attribute types to be 
registered with IANA, should this become necessary. In fact, no 
additional attribute types were ever registered as it was thought 
that none were needed. The revision of RFC 2253 [5] removed the 
requirements for an IANA register and states that additional 
attribute types should be represented by their object identifiers.

RFC 3039 [4] lists the following attribute types that may be used to 
create subject and issuer distinguished names:

countryName;
      commonName;
      surname;
      givenName;
      pseudonym;
      serialNumber;
      organizationName;
      organizationalUnitName;
      stateOrProvinceName
      localityName and
      postalAddress.

The observant reader will notice that the serialNumber, pseudonym, 
and postalAddress attribute types are missing from the RFC 2253 set 
and consequently do not have standardised strings for use in LDAP 
distinguished names. Another example is the emailAddress attribute. 

2. Additional LDAP String Definitions

This document defines the following additional strings that SHOULD be 
used to represent their respective attribute types in LDAP 
distinguished names, as given in the following table:

                    String        X.500 AttributeType
                    ----------------------------------
  SERIALNUMBER      serialNumber
  ADDR              postalAddress     
                    PSEUDO            pseudonym
			  MAIL		  mail/rfc822Mailbox
			  PI			  permanentIdentifier
			  X509SN		  x509serialNumber
                    ISSUER            x509issuer
			  ISSUERSN          x509issuerSerial	
                    UPDATE            x509crlThisUpdate


Note. The strings are case insensitive as far as LDAPv3 is concerned
Note. The string ADDR was borrowed from RFC 2846 [8] rather than 
inventing a new one to represent the same information (an unformatted 
postal address).

3. Permanent Identifier Attribute Type

The definition for the permanentIdentifier attribute type is:
(definition to be added here or in another ID/standard)	


4.  Security Considerations

The following security considerations are specific to the handling of
distinguished names.  LDAP security considerations are discussed in 
[6] and other documents comprising the LDAP Technical Specification 
[7].


5. IANA Considerations

The IANA-maintained "Directory Systems Names" registry [IANADSN] of 
valid keywords for well known attributes used in the LDAPv2 string 
representation of a distinguished name [11] was made Historic
by [12]. If this IANA registry were to be re-activated, the contents 
of this document could be placed in this registry.
