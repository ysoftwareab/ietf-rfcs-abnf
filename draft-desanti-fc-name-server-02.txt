Internet Draft        Fibre-Channel Name Server MIB            July 2004


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related
   to the Fibre Channel network's Name Server function.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel
   provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols such
   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-
   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet
   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a
   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A
   Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may
   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are
   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch
   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single
   port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port
   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A
   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an

   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset
   of E_Port functionality.

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and
   most ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information
   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected to be persistent
   across agent and unit resets.

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers which
   identify the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port has
   both an address identifier and a WWN.  When a fabric is in use, the
   FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.
   Each octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address
   hierarchy, with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.

   The Fibre Channel Name Server provides a way for N_Ports and NL_Ports
   to register and discover Fibre Channel attributes.  Such attributes
   include names, addresses, types, features, etc. at various protocol
   layers, including upper layer protocols specific to Fibre Channel
   (which are sometimes called "FC-4s").  Communication with the Name
   Server is via Fibre Channel's CT (Common Transport for Generic
   Services) using "Information Units" (called CT_IU's) as either
   requests, responses or unsolicited.

   Registrations may be performed by a third party.  However, the Name
   Server may refuse such third party registration for unspecified
   reasons . Once registered, the attributes are made available to
   requestors.

   The Fibre Channel Name Server is defined in the FC-GS specification,
   The latest specification is [FC-GS-4]; the previous version was [FC-
   GS-3].


4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focussed
   on Fibre Channel switches.  It is being replaced by the more generic
   Fibre Channel Management MIB [FC-MGMT] which defines basic
   information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including
   extensions to the standard IF-MIB for Fibre Channel interfaces.

   This MIB extends beyond [FC-MGMT] to cover the functionality, in

Internet Draft        Fibre-Channel Name Server MIB            July 2004


   Fibre Channel switches, of providing Fibre Channel's Name Server
   function.

   This MIB also imports some common Textual Conventions from T11-TC-
   MIB, defined in [FC-FAM-MIB].


5.  MIB Overview

   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of,
   and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of Fibre
   Channel Name Server functionality.  (Note that there are no
   definitions in this MIB module of "managed actions" which can be
   invoked via SNMP.)

5.1.  Fibre Channel management instance

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [FC-MGMT] as a
   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.  Fibre
   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management
   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the
   implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a
   single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with
   each sub-agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management
   instance.

   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB
   [FC-MGMT] as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel
   management instance within the same SNMP context ([RFC3411] section
   3.3.1).

5.2.  Name Server Index

   As well as allowing for multiple Fibre Channel management instances,
   this MIB also allows for multiple instances of the Name Server
   functionality within each Fibre Channel management instance.
   Further, some of the Name Server instances managed by the same Fibre
   Channel management instance, can operate local to a particular Fibre
   Channel switch and some can operate independent of any particular
   switch.

   Therefore, all objects in this MIB are in tables which are INDEX-ed
   by at least fcmInstanceIndex and t11NsIndex, where the latter is an
   index value which uniquely identifies a Name Server instance within a
   Fibre Channel management instance.

Internet Draft        Fibre-Channel Name Server MIB            July 2004


5.3.  Fabric Index

   The current standard for an interconnecting Fabric consisting of
   multiple Fabric Switch elements is [FC-SW-3], which describes the
   operation of a single Fabric in a physical infrastructure.  It is
   possible that future standards will define how multiple Fabrics could
   operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.  In such a
   scenario, each Fabric would, of course, have its own management
   instrumentation.  Therefore, to *allow* for this future possibility,
   this MIB defines all Fabric-related information in tables which are
   INDEX-ed by an arbitrary integer, named a "Fabric Index".  In a
   Fabric which is conformant to [FC-SW-3], the value of this Fabric
   Index will always be 1.

5.4.  The MIB Groups

   This section describes the four MIB groups contained in the MIB.

5.4.1.  The t11NsDBGroup group

   This group contains information about the operation of the Name
   Server function, including an indication of whether each Name Server
   instance operates local to a particular Fibre Channel switch, or
   independently of any Fibre Channel switch.  It also contains the
   information currently registered with the Name Server.

5.4.2.  The t11NsStatsGroup group

   This group contains Name Server statistics.

5.4.3.  The t11NsNotifyControlGroup group

   This group contains those notification control and notification
   information objects which are required for monitoring Name Server
   registrations/de-registrations.

5.4.4.  The t11NsNotifyGroup group

   This group contains notifications which provide for the monitoring of
   Name Server registrations/de-registrations.

5.5.  The Actual Values of Objects

   The objects defined in the t11NsRegTable represent the values
   registered with the Name Server.  The SNMP agent MUST report the

   actual values, even if they are incorrectly formatted.  This is the
   reason why, for example, the two objects which represent IP-
   addresses, t11NsNodeIpAddress and t11NsPortIpAddress, have the SYNTAX
   of OCTET STRING, so that they are able to represent invalid values
   (which could not be represented using InetAddressType and
   InetAddress).

   Similarly, each pair of t11NsRejectReasonCode and
   t11NsRejReasonCodeExp objects holds the values of the actual reject
   code and explanation which was present in the generated Reject
   message (the "Reject CT_IU"), irrespective of whether such a reject
   code and explanation were appropriate or not.

11.  Security Considerations

   There is one management object defined in this MIB module with a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  This
   object and its sensitivity/vulnerability is:

   t11NsRejReqNotifyEnable -- the ability to enable/disable
   notifications.

Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
environments.  For example, the ability to change network topology or
network speed may afford an attacker the ability to obtain better

performance at the expense of other network users.  The support for SET
operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection can
have a negative effect on network operations.

Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to
even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the
network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
sensitivity/vulnerability:

     t11NsRegTable -- contains information about registered Nx_Ports.

     t11NsStatsTable -- contains statistics and state information about
     the Name Server.

SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  Even
if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.

It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including
full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication
and privacy).

Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic
security.  It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that
the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is
properly configured to give access to the objects only to those
principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
(change/create/delete) them.
