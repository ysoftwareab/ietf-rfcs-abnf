1.  Introduction

   This document defines a data model for Large-Scale Measurement
   Platforms (LMAP) [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework].  The data model is
   defined using the YANG [RFC6020] data modeling language.  It aims to
   be consistent with the LMAP Information Model
   [I-D.ietf-lmap-information-model].

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the LMAP terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), and "ro" means state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

   model.

3.  Relationship to the Information Model

   The LMAP information model [I-D.ietf-lmap-information-model] is
   devided into six sections.  They are mapped into the YANG data model
   as explained below:

   o  Pre-Configuration Information: This is not modeled explicitly
      since it is a subset of the configuration information.

   o  Configuration Information: This is modeled in the /lmap/agent
      subtree and the /lmap/schedules, /lmap/tasks, and /lmap/channels
      subtrees described below.  Some items have been left out because
      they are expected to be dealt with by the underlying protocol.

   o  Instruction Information: This is modeled in the /lmap/suppression
      subtree and the /lmap/schedules, /lmap/tasks, and /lmap/channels
      subtrees described below.

   o  Logging Information: Some of the logging information, in
      particular 'success/failure/warning messages in response to
      information updates from the Controller', will be handled by the

      protocol used to manipulate the lmap specific configuration.
      [[CREF1: It needs to be discussed whether we can rely on informal
      syslog messages that can be accessed via protocols such RFC 5277
      or whether we want to define specific notifications in the YANG
      data model. --JS]]

   o  Capability and Status Information: Some of the status information
      is modeled in the /lmap-state/agent subtree.  Information about
      network interfaces can be obtained from the interfaces YANG data
      model [RFC7223].  The list of supported tasks is modeled in the
      /lmap-state/tasks subtree including information about the last
      execution and the last failed execution.

   o  Reporting Information: This is modeled by the report notification.

   These six sections are build on the following common information
   objects:

   o  Schedules: This is modeled in the /lmap/schedules subtree.

   o  Channels: This is modeled in the /lmap/channels subtree.

   o  Task Configurations: This is modeled in the /lmap/tasks subtree.

   o  Timing Information: This is modeled in the /lmap/timings subtree.
