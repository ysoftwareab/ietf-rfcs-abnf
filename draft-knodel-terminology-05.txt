 Terminology, Power, and Inclusive Language in Internet-Drafts and RFCs
                      draft-knodel-terminology-05

Abstract

   This document argues for more inclusive language conventions
   sometimes used by RFC authors and the RFC Production Centre in
   Internet-Drafts that are work in progress, and in new RFCs that may
   be published in any of the RFC series, in order to foster greater
   knowledge transfer and improve diversity of participation in the
   IETF.

1.  Introduction

   According to [RFC7322], "The ultimate goal of the RFC publication
   process is to produce documents that are readable, clear, consistent,
   and reasonably uniform," and one function of the RFC Editor is to
   "[c]orrect larger content/clarity issues; flag any unclear passages
   for author review."  Documents that are published as RFCs are first
   worked on as Internet-Drafts.

   Given the importance of communication between people developing RFCs,
   Internet-Drafts (I-D's), and related documents, it is worth
   considering the effects of terminology that has been identified as
   exclusionary.  This document argues that certain obviously
   exclusionary terms should be avoided and replaced with alternatives.
   We propose nothing more than additional care in the choice of
   language just as care is taken in defining standards and protocols
   themselves.

   This document presents arguments for why exclusionary terms should be
   avoided in Internet-Drafts and RFCs and as an exercise describes the
   problems introduced by some specific terms and why their proposed
   alternatives improve technical documentation.  The example terms
   discussed in this document include "master-slave" and "whitelist-
   blacklist".  There is a final section on additional considerations
   and general action points to address future RFCs and I-D's.  Lastly,
   a summary of recommendations is presented.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology and Power in Internet-Drafts and RFCs

   According to the work of scholar Heather Brodie Graves from 1993,
   "one goal of the application of rhetorical theory in the technical
   communication classroom is to assess the appropriateness of
   particular terms and to evaluate whether these terms will facilitate
   or hinder the readers' understanding of the technical material"
   [BrodieGravesGraves].  This implies that in order to effectively
   communicate the content of I-Ds and RFCs to all readers, it is
   important for Authors to consider the kinds of terms or language



Knodel & ten Oever       Expires August 26, 2021                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                 Terminology                 February 2021


   conventions that may inadvertently get in the way of effective
   communication.  She continues, "complex and subtle configurations of
   sexist, racist, or ethnocentric language use in technical documents
   can derail or interfere with readers' ability and desire to
   comprehend and follow important information."

   Indeed, problems of language are problems of everyday speech.  Racist
   and sexist language is rampant and similarly counter-productive in
   other sectors, notably social work [Burgest].  The terms "master-
   slave," treated in detail below are present in other realms of
   technology, notably "automotive clutch and brake systems, clocks,
   flip-flop circuits, computer drives, and radio transmitters"
   [Eglash].

   However as noted in the research by Ron Eglash, this seemingly
   entrenched technical terminology is relatively recent.  It is not too
   late for these terms to be replaced with alternative metaphors that
   are more accurate, clearer, less distracting, and that do not offend
   their readers.  Language matters and metaphors matter.  Indeed,
   metaphors can be incredibly useful devices to make more human the
   complex technical concepts presented in RFCs.  Metaphors should not
   be avoided, but rather taken seriously.  Renowned linguist George
   Lakoff argued in 1980 that the ubiquitous use of metaphors in our
   everyday speech indicates a fundamental instinct to "structure our
   most basic understandings of experience" [Lakoff].  Metaphors
   structure relationships, and they frame possibilities and
   impossibilities [Wyatt].

   Like Graves, this document recognises the monumental challenge of
   addressing linguistics and power, and attempts to "promote awareness
   that may lead to eventual wide-spread change" [BrodieGravesGraves]
   and suggests first steps for actions that may remedy the inadvertent
   use of undesirable terms'.  To that end, the list below is a tersely
   written set of IETF-specific arguments as to why the RFC Editor
   should be encouraged to correct other content and clarity issues with
   respect to exclusionary language and metaphors:

   1.  The RFC series is intended to remain online in perpetuity.
       Societal attitudes to offensive and exclusionary language shift
       over time in the direction of more empathy, not less.

   2.  That exclusionary terms in RFCs are largely hidden from the
       larger public, or read only by engineers, is no excuse to ignore
       social-level reactions to the terms.  If the terms would be a
       poor choice for user-facing application features, the terms
       should be avoided in technical documentation and specifications,
       too.

   3.  At the time of this drafting, the digital technology community
       has a problem with monoculture.  And because the diversity of the
       technical community is already a problem, a key strategy to
       breaking monoculture is to ensure that technical documentation is
       addressed to a wider audience and greater multiplicity of
       readers.

   4.  And yet the technical community already includes members who take
       offense to these terms.  Eradicating the use of exclusionary
       terminology in official RFCs recognises the presence of and
       acknowledges the requests from black and brown engineers and from
       women and gender-non-conforming engineers to avoid the use of
       exclusionary terminology.

   This document does not try to prescribe terminology shifts for any
   and all language that could be deemed exclusionary.  Instead what
   follow are two examples of specific alternative suggestions to
   "master-slave" and "white-blacklist" and the rationale for the use of
   the alternatives.  Suggested actions for handling additional
   considerations are presented in a subsequent section.

3.1.  Master-Slave

   Master-slave is an offensive and exclusionary metaphor that will and
   should never become fully detached from history.  Aside from being
   unprofessional and exclusionary it stifled the participation of
   students whom Eglash interviewed for his research.  He asks: "If the
   master-slave metaphor affected these tough-minded engineers who had
   the gumption to make it through a technical career back in the days
   when they may have been the only black persons in their classes, what
   impact might it have on black students who are debating whether or
   not to enter science and technology careers at all?"  [Eglash]

   Aside from the arguably most important reason outlined above, these
   terms are becoming less used and therefore increasingly less
   compatible as more communities move away from its use (eg [NIST],
   [Python], [Drupal], [Github] and [Django].  The usage of 'master' and
   'slave' in hardware and software has been halted by the Los Angeles
   County Office of Affirmative Action, the Django community, the Python
   community and several other programming languages.  This was done
   because the language is offensive and hurts people in the community
   [Django2].  Root operator Internet Systems Consortium stopped using
   the terms because they were asked to [ISC].

   In addition to being inappropriate and arcane, the master-slave
   metaphor is both technically and historically inaccurate.  For
   instance, in DNS the 'slave' is able to refuse zone transfers on the
   ground that it is malformed.  The metaphor is incorrect historically



Knodel & ten Oever       Expires August 26, 2021                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 Terminology                 February 2021


   given the most recent centuries during which "the role of the master
   was to abdicate and the role of the slave was to revolt"
   [McClelland].  Yet in another sense slavery is also not 'just an
   historic term', whereas freedom from slavery is a human-rights issue
   [UDHR], it continues to exist in the present [Wikipedia].
   Furthermore, this term set wasn't revived until recently, after WWII,
   and after many of the technologies that adopted it were already in
   use with different terminology [Eglash].

   Ultimately master-slave is a poor choice since it is 1) being used
   less frequently already 2) in a variety of applications 3) to correct
   perceived exclusionary effects 4) at the request of concerned members
   of the technical community.

   To find alternatives to master-slave, one can look to myriad existing
   implementations.  There are also many other relationships that can be
   used as metaphors, Eglash's research calls into question the accuracy
   of the master-slave metaphor.  An alternative should be chosen based
   on the pairing that is most clear in context:

   o  Primary-secondary based on authority.  See for example [RFC8499].

   o  Primary-replica based originality.

   o  Active-standby based on state.

   o  Writer-reader based on function.

3.2.  Blacklist-Whitelist

   The metaphorical use of white-black to connote good-evil is
   exclusive.  While master-slave might seem like a more egregious
   example of racism, white-black is arguably worse because it is more
   pervasive and therefore more insidious.  While recent headlines have
   decried the technical community's use of master-slave, there is far
   less discussion about white-black despite its importance.  There is
   even a name for this pervasive language pitfall: the association of
   white with good and black with evil is known as the "bad is black
   effect" [Grewal].

   Indeed, there is an entire book on the subject, written by renowned
   authority on race, Frantz Fanon.  In his book "Black Skin, White
   Masks," Fanon makes several persuasive arguments that standard
   language encodes subconscious in-group, out-group preferences
   [Fanon].

   In the case of blacklist-whitelist in the technical documentation of
   I-Ds and RFCs, it is entirely a term of art and an arbitrary



Knodel & ten Oever       Expires August 26, 2021                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 Terminology                 February 2021


   metaphorical construct with no technical merit.  There are scientific
   uses of black that are related to light- black holes are black
   because light cannot escape them.  Blacklist-whitelist is not a
   metaphor for lightness or darkness, it is a good-evil metaphor and
   therefore this trope has significant impact on how people are seen
   and treated.  As we've seen with metaphors, its use is pervasive and,
   though not necessarily conscious, perceptions do get promulgated
   through culture and repetition.

   As with master-slave, we save our technical argument for last,
   referencing and presenting first the reasons for the use of non-
   offensive, alternative terminology for the sake of our humanity.
   Indeed, our technical argument is incredibly succinct: Why use a
   metaphor when a direct description is both succinct and clear?  There
   can be absolutely no ambiguity if one uses the terms, as suggested
   below, allow-block rather than white-black.

   There are alternatives to this terminology set that vastly improve
   clarity because they are not even metaphors, they're descriptions.
   The alternatives proposed here say exactly what they mean.

   o  Accept-list and Drop-list for threat signaling.  See for example
      [RFC8612], [RFC8782], and [RFC8783]).

   o  Blocklist-allowlist, deny-allow, exempt-allowlist or block-permit
      for permissions.

3.3.  Other Considerations

   As described in the preceding sections, the language used in
   technical documentation, like all written text, creates and
   reinforces expectations and stereotypes.  We propose nothing more
   than additional care in the choice of language just as care is taken
   in defining standards and protocols themselves.  The two examples
   provided above are not the only cases of exclusionary language to be
   avoided, and many more can be collected.  We use this section to
   broaden the context of other offensive and exclusionary terminologies
   to encompass additional concerns, why spotting and eradicating
   problematic terminologies is a valid endeavour for authors and
   editors of technical documentaion and how this might be systematised.

   There are many other metaphors present in technical documentation
   that are "terms of art" but that have no technical basis whatsoever.
   If any of these metaphors is offensive there is no excuse for its
   continued use.  A term like "man-in-the-middle" is not technically
   useful.  It is not a standard term, not as clear as its alternative
   "on-path attacker", and should therefore be avoided.  When presented
   with the opportunity to employ the use of metaphors or to



Knodel & ten Oever       Expires August 26, 2021                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                 Terminology                 February 2021


   unthinkingly repeat terms of art that connote gender or race, Authors
   should simply find a better way to explain themselves.  A fun read on
   the politics of colloquial speech by George Orwell should dissuade
   any clever Author from using tired explanatory metaphors [Orwell].

   Gendered pronouns and sexism are common place but easy to spot and
   replace.  Up until recently, strict English grammatists like Orwell
   decried the use of the neutral pronoun "they".  Without a neutral
   singular pronoun, "he" is assumed as the default singular pronoun
   when the gender of the person is unknown or ambiguous.  However, that
   has changed, and it is now widely accepted that "they" can be used as
   a neutral singular pronoun.  Since it is unlikely that all
   implementers and infrastructure operators are of any particular
   gender, "he" should never be used to refer to a person in I-Ds and
   RFCs.  An Author who uses male examples sets male-ness as a standard.

   Besides race and gender, our world is full of metaphors rooted in
   oppression, ableism, and colonialism.  Militarised metaphors are also
   a pervasive problem in language, perhaps even more so in technical
   communities because of the historical and actual relationship between
   technology and war.

   While it is not our intention to be exhaustive we hope to have made a
   persuasive case for authors and editors to pay attention to the finer
   details of metaphor, and the ways power is replicated in technical
   documentation unless detailed attention is paid.  The example terms
   above "master-slave" and "blacklist-whitelist" are already less
   common.  If the IETF community has learned anything from the deabte
   over the use of these terms, and this document, it is that language
   matters to us deeply as members of society and as engineers.  And
   because language, and society, change over time, we must approach
   future concerns with some degree of dispassion when the arguments
   presented in the first section can be clearly applied.

   There is harm in protracted discussion about the validity IETF
   participants and their experiences with exclusionary terminology.
   The racism in the community that has been surfaced as a result of
   this larger debate among technologists pushed away participants and
   observers.  This illustrates the need to, as Graves is cited above as
   saying, continue to raise awareness within our community for
   eventual, lasting change on the continued front of struggle against
   the racists amongst us.  Yet we recommend a living stylesheet, rather
   than repeated RFCs, be used as a mechanism for monitoring
   exclusionary language in IETF documents [inclusiveterminology].

   It is there that we welcome additional examples of terminology that
   might be avoided through more awareness and thoughtfulness.

4.  Summary of Recommendations

   To summarise, we have bulleted some very concrete action points that
   can be taken by Editors, reviewers and Authors, both present and
   future as they develop and publish Internet-Drafts and new RFCs.

   Authors SHOULD: * Replace the exclusionary terms "master-slave" and
   "blacklist-whitelist" with more accurate alternatives.  * Read and
   reflect upon the repository of exclusionary terminology
   [inclusiveterminology].  * Reflect on their use of metaphors
   generally.  * Consider changing existing exclusionary language in
   current (reference) implementations [socketwench].  * Consult the RFC
   style sheet maintained by the RFC editor and the community that can
   be found at https://github.com/ietf/terminology .

   RFC Editor MUST: * Offer alternatives for exclusionary terminology as
   an important act of correcting larger editorial issues and clarifying
   technical concepts and * Maintain the IETF repository that collects
   all terms that have been considered and indicate wheter they are
   deemed acceptable, and if not what terms Authors should consider
   instead.  * Suggest to Authors that even when referencing other
   specifications that have not replaced offensive terminology, the
   Authors could use another term in their document and include a note
   to say that they have used the new term as a replacement for the term
   used in the referenced document.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security is dependent on a wide range of actors that are implementing
   technical documentation.  Therefore it is crucial that language is
   clear, and understood by all that need to implement this
   documentation.  Correct and inclusive language is therefore conducive
   for secure implementations of technical documentation.
