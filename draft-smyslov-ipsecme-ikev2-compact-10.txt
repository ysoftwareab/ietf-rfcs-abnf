                    Compact Format of IKEv2 Payloads
                 draft-smyslov-ipsecme-ikev2-compact-10

Abstract

   This document describes a method for reducing the size of the
   Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) messages by using an
   alternative format for IKE payloads.  Standard format of many IKE
   payloads contains a lot of redundancy.  This document takes advantage
   of this fact and specifies a way to eliminate some redundancy by
   using denser encoding.  Reducing size of IKEv2 messages is desirable
   for low power consumption battery powered devices.  It also helps to
   avoid IP fragmentation of IKEv2 messages.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) specified in
   [RFC7296] is used in the IP Security (IPsec) architecture for the
   purposes of Security Association (SA) parameters negotiation and
   authenticated key exchange.  The protocol uses UDP as the transport
   for its messages, which size varies from less than one hundred bytes
   to several kBytes.

   Decreasing the size of IKEv2 messages is highly desirable for the
   Internet of Things (IoT) devices utilizing lower power consumption
   technology.  For some of such devices the power consumption for
   transmitting extra bits over network is prohibitively high (see
   appendix A of [IPSEC-IOT-REQS]).  Many such devices are battery
   powered without an ability to recharge or to replace the battery
   which serves for the life cycle of the device (often several years).
   For this reason the task of reducing the power consumption for such
   devices is very important and decreasing messages size is one of the
   ways to accomplish it.

   Large UDP messages may also cause fragmentation at the IP level,
   which may interact badly with Network Address Translators (NAT).  In
   particular, some NATs drop IP fragments that don't contain TCP/UDP
   port numbers (non-initial IP fragments), so that the IP datagram

   cannot be reassembled on the receiving end and IKE SA cannot be
   established.  One of the possible solutions to the problem is IKEv2
   fragmentation [RFC7383].  However, the IKEv2 fragmentation can only
   be applied to encrypted messages and thus cannot be used in the
   initial IKEv2 exchange, IKE_SA_INIT.  Usually the IKE_SA_INIT
   messages are relatively small and don't cause IP fragmentation.
   However, while more and more new algorithms and protocol extensions
   are included in IKEv2, these messages become larger and larger thus
   increasing the risk of IP fragmentation.  It is desirable to make
   IKEv2 messages more compact to help avoid this risk.

   IKEv2 messages are comprised of data structures called payloads.
   Each payload consists of a common part (Generic Payload Header)
   followed by a payload-specific data which is formatted differently
   depending on the payload's purpose.  Section 3 of [RFC7296] lists
   formats for all standard IKEv2 payloads.  As one can see some IKEv2
   payloads are formatted in such a way, that there are substantial
   redundancy in their encoding.  This document defines an alternative
   format for the IKEv2 payloads, which provides denser encoding, that
   allows making IKEv2 messages more compact.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Overview

   The idea behind the protocol is to develop an alternative compact
   encoding of IKEv2 payloads that meets the following requirements:

   1.  The compact encoding must be applicable to all already defined
       IKEv2 payloads as well as to future payloads, so it must not
       depend on payload format.  There may be few special cases if
       specific encoding is justified by much higher efficiency.

   2.  The compact encoding must be easily converted to standard
       encoding and vice versa.  This allows implementations to re-use
       existing composing/parsing code and to apply compact encoding/
       decoding as pre/post process steps in message processing.

   3.  The compact encoding/decoding algorithm must consume low
       resources in terms of code size, CPU consumption and memory
       footprint.

Internet-Draft                IKEv2 Compact               September 2021


   4.  The compact encoding must never increase the payload size and
       must be effective enough to noticeably decrease the size of most
       payloads.

   To meet these requirements the encoding algorithm must be independent
   from the particular payload format.  In other words, it must take any
   given payload and perform some kind of compression.  General purpose
   lossless compression algorithms are usually not very effective when
   they are applied to small amount of data.  Fortunately format of many
   IKEv2 payloads has a peculiarity that allows using simple and
   relatively efficient compression algorithm.

   Many IKEv2 payloads contain a lot of zero octets.  These octets come
   from the following sources:

   o  Many Payload Headers contain RESERVED fields that must be zeroed
      according to IKEv2 specification.

   o  Payload length is encoded in two octets, while most IKEv2 payloads
      are less than 256 octets in size.

   o  Substantial number of IKEv2 parameters is encoded in two octets,
      while the number of currently defined values for these parameters
      is less than one hundred (see [IKEV2-IANA]).

   The idea is to omit these zero octets from the compact payload and
   supply a bitmap that will indicate which octets were omitted.

   IKEv2 header also contains some redundancy - in particular the Length
   field occupies four octets, while IKEv2 messages are extremely
   unlikely to exceed few Kb in size.  However, some middleboxes perform
   an inspection of IKEv2 header and changing its format will likely
   interact badly with these middleboxes.  Thus, the possible saving of
   few octets doesn't justify modification of IKEv2 header.

4.  Compact Representation of IKEv2 Payloads

   This document defines one generic compact format suitable for
   compacting any IKEv2 payload and two specific compact formats - one
   for SA payload and the other for Notify payload containing status
   notification with no data.  The rationale for such a design is the
   following.

   One common generic compact format simplifies implementations and
   allows using it with any currently defined and not yet defined
   payloads.  However, it doesn't provide high level of efficiency.

   SA payload contains a lot of redundancy and can be encoded in highly
   efficient way.  Moreover, this payload grows up quickly once more new
   transforms are defined and implementations start using them.  In some
   cases the SA payload can be the largest payload in the IKE_SA_INIT
   exchange.  So, there is a natural desire to encode it differently to
   gain better result.  On the other hand, Notify payload with status
   notification containing no data is often used in IKEv2 initial
   exchange to negotiate support for various protocol extensions.  So,
   there are usually several such payloads in the IKE_SA_INIT request
   and response messages, ant it is anticipated that their number will
   increase as long as more and more IKEv2 extensions are defined.
   That's why this payload is also encoded differently to make initial
   messages more compact.

4.1.  Compact Generic Payload

   Generic IKEv2 payload is depicted below (Figure 1) for convenience.
   It consists of generic payload header followed by payload data.
   Brief description of generic payload header fields is provided below,
   readers should refer to Section 3.2 of [RFC7296] for full
   description.

   Some payloads have extended headers following the generic payload
   header.  For the purpose of compact payload encoding any extended
   header is treated as part of payload data.  Complete description of
   IKEv2 Payload formats can be found in Section 3 of [RFC7296].

   Figure 2 shows generic compact payload format.

   o  Next Payload (1 octet) - Identifier for the payload type of the
      next payload in the message.  The value is taken intact from
      original payload.

   o  Critical (1 bit) - This bit is set if the current payload cannot
      be skipped in case the receiver doesn't understand its type and
      cleared if it is safe to skip this payload.  The value is taken
      intact from original payload.

   o  Bmap (4 bits) - Bitmap, contains bitmap where each bit indicates
      whether one of the four first octets of original Payload Data was
      zero and thus was omitted from Compacted Payload Data.  If the bit
      is set, then the corresponding octet was zero and was omitted, if
      the bit is cleared, then either the corresponding octet was copied
      or it didn't present in the original Payload Data (in case the
      octet would be outside the original payload).  The rightmost bit
      of the map corresponds to the first of the four octets and the
      leftmost bit corresponds to the last of these four octets.

   o  XBL (3 bits) - Extended Bitmap Length, specifies the number of
      Extended Bitmap octets plus one.  Note, that by construction this
      field cannot be zero.

   o  Payload Length (1 octet) - Length in octets of compacted payload
      not including Extended Bitmap.

   o  Compacted Payload Data (variable) - Contains original payload data
      with some zero octets omitted.  Up to 52 zero octets from the
      beginning of original payload data can be omitted, the rest of
      original payload data is always copied.

   o  Extended Bitmap (variable, 0 - 6 octets) - contains extended
      bitmap.  Each octet of this bitmap represents how the
      corresponding eight octets of the original payload data were
      handled - original octets corresponding to the set bits were zero
      and thus were omitted from the compacted payload data, while
      octets corresponding to the cleared bits were copied.  First octet
      in the Extended Bitmap corresponds to octets from 5 to 12 of the
      original payload data, next octet - to octets from 13 to 20, etc.
      Note, that the Bmap field indicates how octets from 1 to 4 were
      handled.  In each octet of extended bitmap the rightmost bit
      represents the first of corresponding original octets and the
      leftmost bit represents the last one.

   An IKEv2 payload can be compacted if it meets two requirements:

   o  The payload length is less than 256 octets.  In other words, the
      high order octet of Payload Length field is zero.

   o  The RESERVED field in the generic payload header is zero.
      Section 3.2 of [RFC7296] requires that this field must always be
      zero when preparing payload.

   If payload doesn't meet these requirement it is included into the
   message without modification.  The regular and compact payloads can
   be present in any order in the compact IKEv2 message.  The receiving
   side can distinguish between them by analyzing the least significant
   three bits of RESERVED field in generic payload header.  These bits
   correspond to XBL field in compact generic payload header, and this
   field will always be non-zero in compact payload while these bits are
   required to be zero in regular payload.

   If payload meets the above requirements then it is compacted as
   follows.

   1.  The Next Payload and Critical fields are copied from original
       payload.

   2.  The first 4 octets of the original payload data are scanned one
       by one.  If the current octet is zero, then it is omitted from
       the Compacted Payload data and the corresponding bit (starting
       from the rightmost bit to the leftmost bit) in Bmap field is set.
       Otherwise the octet is copied and the corresponding bit is

       cleared.  If there are no more octets in the original payload
       data then the process stops and the rest of Bmap is zeroed.

   3.  If more octets are left in the original payload data, then the
       next 48 of them are scanned one by one.  Since the Extended
       Bitmap position isn't known yet a temporary bitmap of six octets
       is used.  If the current octet is zero, then it is omitted from
       the Compacted Payload Data and the corresponding bit (starting
       from the rightmost bit to the leftmost bit) in the corresponding
       octet of a temporary bitmap is set.  Otherwise the original octet
       is copied and the corresponding bit in temporary bitmap is
       cleared.  If there are no more octets in the original payload
       data then the process stops and the remaining bits of the current
       temporary bitmap octet are zeroed.

   4.  If more octets are left in the original payload data, they are
       copied to the Compacted Payload Data.

   5.  The Payload Length field is set to indicate the size of Compacted
       Payload Data plus 3.  It will indicate the offset of the Extended
       Bitmap from the beginning of compact payload.

   6.  The content of the temporary bitmap is copied to the Extended
       Bitmap field (after the Compacted Payload Data).  The temporary
       bitmap octets are copied one by one up to the first zero octet
       (if any).  In other words, the Extended Bitmap MUST NOT contain
       zero octets.

   7.  The XBL field is set to the number of octets placed in the
       Extended Bitmap plus one.

4.2.  Compact SA Payload

   SA payload is compacted differently than generic IKEv2 payload.  The
   specific format for Compact SA payload allows achieving very high
   level of compression.  High level of compression is important,
   because SA payload grows up quickly as more and more cryptographic
   transforms are defined, get widespread adoption and advertised by
   Initiators.

   Unlike generic compact payload, which retains its payload type and is
   distinguished from regular IKEv2 payload by analyzing the leftmost
   three bits of RESERVED field of the generic payload header, the
   Compact SA payload has its own payload type.  The reason is that its
   format (Figure 3) is completely different and the above method cannot
   be used.  The Compact SA payload is denoted CSA, and its payload type
   is <TBA by IANA>.

4.2.2.  Compact Transform Substructures

   Compact Transform substructures are encoded differently depending on
   Transform Type, Transform ID and presence of attributes to get most
   effective encoding for common use cases.  The leftmost bits of the
   first octet of the Compact Transform substructure are used to
   distinguish between different formats.  These bits are called Tag.
   The table below shows how Tag value correlates with Compact Transform
   substructure format.

      Table 1: Tag values and corresponding Compact Transform formats

   Short formats are the most efficient Compact Transform formats, they
   occupy only one octet; long format occupies either two or three
   octets depending on the Transform ID value.  Both short and long
   formats can be used only for some Transform Types and can represent
   only limited number of Transform IDs.  Moreover, both short and long
   formats cannot be used if Transform contains any attributes, except
   if it is the Encryption Transform and it contains the Key Length
   attribute and the value of the attribute is either 128 or 256.  The
   Table 1 summarizes the restrictions each format implies.

   Full format imposes no constraints on the Transform Type and
   Transform ID, as well on the attributes the transform could contain.

   Short formats allow encoding both Transform Type and Transform ID
   using single octet.  There are several variations of short format - a
   generic short format and a number of specific formats for different
   Transform Types that take advantage of the concrete Transform IDs
   defined in [IKEV2-IANA] for these Transform Types.

   o  T(ag) (1 bit) - MUST be 0.

   o  Type (3 bits) - Transform Type minus 6.  This allows Transform
      Types from 6 to 13 to be encoded using this format.

      that either no Key Length attribute is present in the original
      Transform or it is present and its value is 128.  Tag values 101
      indicates that Key Length attribute containing value 256 is
      present in the original Transform.

   o  E ( bit) - Extended Sequence Numbers Transform ID (either 0 or 1).

4.2.2.6.  Long Format

   Long format (Figures 10 and 11) is used when Transform doesn't meet
   requirements for short format encoding, but still meets the following
   requirements:

   1.  Transform Type is between 1 and 15.  At the time this document
       was written only Transform Types 1 to 5 were defined (see
       [IKEV2-IANA]).

   2.  Transform has no attributes.

   3.  Transform ID is less than or equal to 32767.

Internet-Draft                IKEv2 Compact               September 2021


   Long format allows to effectively encode Transform IDs for Transform
   Types that don't fit into the short format, e.g. private Transform
   IDs (if these transforms don't have associated attributes and its
   value is less than or equal to 32767).

   Long format can occupy two or three octets depending on the Transform
   ID value.  For values 0-127 only one octet is used to represent the
   value, for values 128-32767 two octets are used.  Values greater than
   32767 require using full format.

4.2.2.7.  Full Format

   Full format of Compact Transform substructure allows encoding of any
   transform without restrictions.  It is used when transform cannot be
   encoded neither in short format nor in long format.  The format
   (Figure 12) resembles regular Transform Substructure with all
   RESERVED fields removed.  The Compact Transform substructure fields
   are briefly described below.  Readers should refer to Section 3.3.2
   of [RFC7296] for detailed description of Compact Transform
   substructure fields with the same names, as in regular Transform
   substructure.

4.3.  Compact Notify Payload

   Notify payloads containing status notifications with no data are
   often used in IKEv2.  This is "de facto" standard way to negotiate
   various protocol extensions and for that reason usually several such
   Notify payloads are present in initial IKEv2 exchanges.  It is
   anticipated that the number of IKEv2 extensions will increase and
   thus the size of initial exchange messages will increase too.  This

Internet-Draft                IKEv2 Compact               September 2021


   is the reason that this kind of Notify payload is encoded
   specifically, to get more effective message compression.

   As well as Compact SA payload, Compact Notify payload has its own
   payload type.  The Compact Notify payload is denoted CN, and its
   payload type is <TBA by IANA>.

         Figure 13: Compact Notify Payload for Status Notification

   o  Next Payload (1 octet) - Identifier for the payload type of the
      next payload in the message.  The value is taken intact from
      original payload.

   o  Notify Type (1 octet) - The type of notification message minus
      16384.

   Despite the fact that Compact Notify payload has different payload
   type and different format than regular Notify payload, the associated
   semantics MUST be the same.

   Notify payload can be encoded as Compact Notify payload if it meets
   the following requirements (see Section 3.10 of [RFC7296] for Notify
   payload format):

   1.  Notify Message Type is between 16384 and 16639 (inclusive).  This
       corresponds to status notifications.

   2.  Protocol ID is zero.

   3.  SPI Size is zero, meaning no SPI is present.

   4.  Notification Data is empty.

   At the time this document was written about 40 percent of status
   notifications defined in [IKEV2-IANA] met these requirements.  If
   Notify payload doesn't meet these requirements, the generic compact
   format (Section 4.1) can be tried.

5.  Compact Format Negotiation

   Most IKEv2 extensions are negotiated in the following way.  The
   Initiator announces its support for some extension by including
   corresponding Vendor ID payload or Notify payload containing status
   notification in the request message of IKE_SA_INIT or IKE_AUTH
   exchanges.  If the Responder supports this extension it returns the
   same (or some specific) payload to the Initiator in response message.
   Responder that doesn't support compact format just ignores these
   payloads in accordance with IKEv2 specification.

   This method is inappropriate for negotiation of compact format,
   because Initiator should be able to send an initial request message
   in compact form and thus it must inform Responder somehow that the
   message must be parsed differently than regular IKEv2 message.  Since
   compact message may contain regular IKEv2 payloads, it is possible to
   define a new status notification and to include it without compacting
   as the very first payload in the initial request.  However, this
   spoils the whole idea of reducing initial messages size, since this
   payload will increase message size for no good reason.

   Instead this document specifies a different negotiation mechanism.
   An alternative initial exchange is defined, ALT_IKE_SA_INIT.
   Initiator wishing to use compact representations of IKEv2 payloads
   MUST start creating IKEv2 SA using ALT_IKE_SA_INIT exchange instead
   of IKE_SA_INIT.  The very first ALT_IKE_SA_INIT request may contain
   compact payloads.  If Responder receives ALT_IKE_SA_INIT request and
   doesn't support compact format, then according to Section 2.21.1 of
   [RFC7296] it discards the request.  It may also send INVALID_SYNTAX
   notification.  For the Initiator receiving no response after several
   retransmissions or receiving INVALID_SYNTAX notification is an
   indication that the Responder doesn't support compact format.  In
   this case the Initiator MAY restart initial request using regular
   IKE_SA_INIT request.

   If the Responder supports compact format then it response with
   ALT_IKE_SA_INIT response, confirming to the Initiator that using
   compact format is successfully negotiated.  Once using compact format
   is negotiated, compact payloads may appear in any message of
   subsequent exchanges in the context of the IKE SA being negotiated.
   If IKE SA is rekeyed, then the flag whether compact format is allowed
   MUST be inherited by the new SA from the old one.

   The semantics associated with ALT_IKE_SA_INIT exchange MUST be the
   same, as the semantics associated with IKE_SA_INIT exchange.  In
   other words, when ALT_IKE_SA_INIT exchange is used, the endpoints
   must behave exactly as if it is IKE_SA_INIT exchange.  The only
   difference (apart from different Exchange Types) is that IKE_SA_INIT

Internet-Draft                IKEv2 Compact               September 2021


   messages MUST NOT contain compact payloads, while ALT_IKE_SA_INIT MAY
   contain them.

6.  Interaction with other IKEv2 Extensions

   When using compact encoding with IKEv2 Session Resumption [RFC5723],
   the flag indicating whether peers negotiated compact format MUST be
   stored in the resumption ticket and used in an SA created as a result
   of resumption.

7.  Security Considerations

   Compact format of IKEv2 payloads doesn't change security properties
   of the protocol, which are described in Section 5 of [RFC7296].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new Payloads in the "IKEv2 Payload Types"
   registry:

     <TBA>       Compact SA Payload                CSA
     <TBA>       Compact Notify Payload            CN

   This document also defines a new Exchange Type in the "IKEv2 Exchange
   Types" registry:

     <TBA>       ALT_IKE_SA_INIT
