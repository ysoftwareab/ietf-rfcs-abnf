Internet-Draft         VPLS Extensions for PBB                July 2007 
    

   IEEE 802.1ah draft standard [IEEE802.1ah], also known as Provider 
   Backbone Bridges (PBB) defines an architecture and bridge protocols 
   for interconnection of multiple Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB 
   was defined in IEEE as a connectionless technology based on 
   multipoint VLAN tunnels. MSTP is used as the core control plane for 
   loop avoidance and load balancing. As a result, the coverage of the 
   solution is limited by STP scale in the core of large service 
   provider networks.   

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4762] provides a solution for 
   extending Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities, 
   through a routed MPLS backbone without running (M)STP across the 
   backbone. As a result, VPLS has been deployed on a large scale in 
   service provider networks.  

   This draft discusses extensions to the VPLS model required to 
   incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining the Service 
   Provider fit of the initial model.

1. Terminology 

   [IEEE802.1ah] provides terminology for Provider Backbone Bridging. 

   This document defines the following additional terms: 

   B-x: a component of the Backbone domain 

   B-VPLS: a VPLS that operates in the Backbone MAC domain, carrying one 
   or multiple I-VPLS instances 

   B-VSI: A VPLS Service Instance (VSI) that participates in a B-VPLS 

   B-FEC: A FEC associated with a certain B-VSI association 

   B-PW: A PW interconnecting two B-VSI Instances 

   I-x: a component of the customer domain 

   I-VPLS: a VPLS that participates in the customer MAC layer - i.e. it 
   uses the customer MAC addresses (basically the destination address) 
   to switch Ethernet frames 

   I-VSI: A VPLS Service Instance (VSI) that participates in an I-VPLS 

   I-FEC: A FEC associated with a certain I-VSI association 

   I-PW: A PW interconnecting two I-VSI Instances 

   PBB VPLS: a PBB Service built around an I-VPLS component aggregated 
   through a B-VPLS "tunnel" 

   PBB PE: a PE that contains an I-VSI and a related B-VSI. 

2. Introduction 

   The IEEE model for PBB is organized around a B-component handling the 
   provider backbone layer and an I-component concerned with the mapping

   of Customer/Provider Bridge (QinQ) domain (e.g. MACs, VLANs) to the 
   provider backbone (e.g. B-MACs, B-VLANs): i.e. the I-component 
   contains the boundary between the Customer and Backbone MAC domains. 
   PBB encapsulates customer payload in a provider backbone Ethernet 
   header, providing for Customer MAC hiding capabilities. 

   PBB requires the use of MSTP as the core control plane (B-domain) for 
   loop avoidance and load balancing. As a result, the coverage of the 
   solution is limited by STP scale in the core of large service 
   provider networks.  

   VPLS provides a solution for extending Ethernet LAN services, using 
   MPLS tunneling capabilities, through a routed MPLS backbone without 
   running (M)STP across the backbone. VPLS use of the structured FEC 
   129 [RFC4762] also allows for inter-domain, inter-provider 
   connectivity and enables auto-discovery options across the network 
   improving the service delivery options.  

   VPLS creates an emulated LAN Segment using as building blocks a set 
   of Virtual Switch Instances (VSIs) interconnected using Virtual Links 
   - i.e. based on Pseudo Wires (PWs) or native Ethernet.  

   In a large scale deployment, there might be a need to split the 
   backbone domain into two or more domains using the Hierarchical-VPLS 
   (H-VPLS) model described in [RFC4762]. This may be required for 
   administrative reasons, or to provide efficient handling of packet 
   replication. In this context VPLS scalability may be improved by 
   hiding the customer MAC addresses at the edge PEs so that the core 
   PEs (e.g. PE-rs) handle just the Provider MAC addresses.  

   This document proposes simple extensions to the VPLS model to allow 
   for selective inclusion of useful PBB capabilities while continuing 
   to avoid the use of MSTP in the backbone. The proposed solution 
   accommodates though the use of native Ethernet model, MSTP-based for 
   the PBBN [IEEE802.1ah] should a provider choose to deploy it.  

   The basic functions do not require changes to existing PW, MPLS data 
   or control plane. In this document, we are proposing some optional 
   extensions to PW signaling to optimize the MAC Withdraw process and 
   to address flood containment in the backbone VPLS. 

3. Reference Model 

   At a high level, a PBB VPLS may be represented as one or more I-
   VPLSes interconnected via a Backbone VPLS (B-VPLS) that may be seen 
   as a multi-point tunnel. Inside a particular PBB PE, a "PBB VPLS VSI" 
   may be modeled as an "I-VSI" mapped to a "B-VSI" operating on

   Customer and the Backbone MAC layer, respectively, as depicted in 
   Figure 1. The PBB PE provides equivalent function with a PBB IB-BEB - 
   see [IEEE802.1ah].

   the implementations to optimize the functions described in this 
   document as long as they provide for solution interoperability. 

   The I-VSIs may be mapped 1:1 or many:1 (m:1) to the B-VSIs. PBB 
   Customer MAC hiding and aggregation functions are provided by 
   encapsulating the Customer MAC frame into a Provider Ethernet Header 
   and by mapping the Customer MACs to Backbone MACs. An I-component 
   Service ID (ISID) may be used to provide additional multiplexing 
   capabilities (m:1 model).  

   Pseudo Wires or native Ethernet virtual ports may be associated with 
   these entities in Backbone and/or Customer domains. In Figure 1 they 
   are tagged with B-PW/B-ETH and I-PW/I-ETH, respectively. Each of 
   these domains may use a full mesh, a hub and spoke topology or a 
   combination as described in [RFC4762].  

    

4. Deployment Scenarios 

   VPLS is being deployed in the Service Provider networks as a solution 
   for Ethernet Multi-point service spanning multiple network domains 
   (e.g. Metro Ethernet networks interconnected via a 
   national/international MPLS backbone). Figure 2 shows an example of 
   three VPLS domains where PE 3 and PE4 are the core PEs. 

   For some very large Layer 2 VPNs (i.e., with large number of MAC 
   addresses), it may make sense to use a PBB "VPLS VSI" in the edge PEs 
   (1, 2, 5 and 6) to hide the customer MAC addresses from the core PEs. 
   Dynamically signaled B-PWs are used to provide B-VSI interconnect 
   over a routed MPLS backbone, eliminating the need for per service 
   configuration throughout the core.  

   Carrier of Carrier Services may be sold using this additional 
   hierarchy of services where the a Carrier may sell a L2 Service using 
   its MPLS infrastructure but use PBB to separate the addressing of its 
   Carrier customer from its backbone. 

   IEEE 802.1ah specification allows for 1:1 or m:1 I-component(s) to B-
   component mapping. The former option (1:1) may be chosen by a service 
   provider who is content with the level of service multiplexing 
   provided by the B-PWs. In this particular scenario there is no need 
   for using an ISID for identifying the service: i.e. the B-PW fully 
   identifies the end customer VSI (I-VSI).

   Alternatively the ISID may be used to provide an additional level of 
   service multiplexing, on top of the B-PW service label.  

   In the (m:1) model, there are use cases where the I-VPLS domains that 
   share the same B-VPLS overlap but in most practical scenarios that is 
   not the case. A broadcast and flood containment solution in that case 
   will be required. 

   While this document is focused on PBB VPLS solution where B-PWs are 
   used as core infrastructure, the model allows for native Ethernet 
   Access (QinQ and/or PBB) or even a full PBB solution to be deployed 
   using just the I-ETH or B-ETH interconnects between the related I-
   VSIs and respectively B-VSIs. However, these are the subject of 
   [IEEE802.1ah] and are out of the scope of this document. Description

   of the framework and requirements for interoperability between the 
   IEEE and VPLS model is given in [VPLS-PBB-Interop]. 

   Specific service provider requirements often define the boundaries of 
   PBB and VPLS domains within their networks. It is not in the scope of 
   this document to specify how far in the Metro Area Network (MAN) or 
   the Wide Area Network (WAN) PBB and VPLS boundaries extend. The PBB 
   VPLS may co-exist in the same PE with non PBB services (i.e., regular 
   VPLS or VLLs using MPLS PW where PBB Customer MAC hiding and 
   aggregation functions are not required). 

5. Data Plane 

   The core PEs (PE3 and PE4 in Figure 2) do not need to be aware about 
   the PBB encapsulation (i.e., just the regular Backbone Ethernet 
   header is used to forward the Ethernet frames). Existing VPLS and 
   PWE3 procedures, including Multi-Segment PWs (MS-PW) apply.  

   At the PBB PEs, additional PBB encapsulation/de-encapsulation is 
   required when passing the frame between the I and B components. ISID 
   look-up is used to differentiate between I-VSI entities whenever 
   (m:1) model is used. 

6. Auto-Discovery 

   Existing VPLS discovery procedures as per [L2VPN-Sig] may be used in 
   the B-VPLS domain and even inside each local I-VPLS domain.  

   End-to-end auto-discovery of I-VPLS instances coincides with BVPLS 
   discovery for the 1:1 I-VSI to B-VSI model. The (m:1) model requires 
   further examination. 

7. Signaling 

   The setup of the B-PWs and/or the I-PWs between related VSI entities 
   may be achieved using the existing PWE3 procedures - see [RFC4762]. 
   FEC 128 or FEC 129 may be used to identify each VSI instance 
   accordingly. 

   Lack of congruency among customer VPN domains might motivate Service 
   Providers to deploy an (1:1) model (I to B) as a simple solution for 
   flood containment. For this particular scenario, the backbone FEC and 
   related PW Service Labels fully identify the PBB VPLS in the control 
   and data plane, respectively. There is no need for the ISID to be 
   configured, signaled or used in the data plane to provide service 
   multiplexing/demultiplexing.

Internet-Draft         VPLS Extensions for PBB                July 2007 
    

   For the m:1 (I to B) model it is useful to include in the LDP 
   signaling the I-VPLS information associated with the PBB VPLS 
   instances. The ISID information and the associated BMAC on a certain 
   PBB PE may be signaled when required using a new LDP TLV, the "PBB 
   TLV".  

   This TLV may be used for the m:1 model in conjunction with the B-VPLS 
   FEC TLV to invoke MAC table pre-mature aging upon topology changes in 
   the related B-VPLS infrastructure or attached networks and to achieve 
   broadcast and flood containment per service instance as described in 
   section 7.1 and 7.2, respectively.  

   A suggested PBB TLV structure is given below: 

    0                   1                   2                   3   

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1   

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   

   |1|0|        PBB TLV (TBD)      |           Length              |  

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   | Sub-TLV Type  |    Length     |    Variable Length Value      | 

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   |                         Variable Length Value                 | 

   |                             "                                 | 

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   The PBB sub-TLV type values are TBD. The Length field is used to 
   define the length of the PBB sub-TLV including the type and the 
   length itself. Processing of the sub-TLVs should continue when 
   unknown ones are encountered, and they MUST be silently ignored. 

   One or more of the following sub-TLV may be included in the PBB TLV: 

   - I-VPLS ID sub-TLV type 

     A 4 octet value containing the ISID value of the related I-VPLS 

   - B-MAC Address sub-TLV type 

 
 
Balus, et al.          Expires January 8, 2008                 [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft         VPLS Extensions for PBB                July 2007 
    

     A 6 octet value containing the BMAC address associated with the I-
     VPLS ID(s) on the sender node.   

 
   Usage of this optional new TLV is specified in the following 
   sections.  

               7.1. MAC Address Withdraw 

   The use of Address Withdraw message with MAC List TLV is proposed in 
   [RFC4762] as a way to expedite removal of MAC addresses as the result 
   of a topology change (e.g. failure of a primary link or of a VPLS PE 
   used as one in a pair of switches in a dual-homing use case). These 
   existing procedures apply to B-VPLS and I-VPLS domains.  

   When it comes to reflecting failures in access networks across the 
   core (i.e. B-VPLS) domain certain additions should be considered as 
   described below.  

   MAC Switching in PBB is based on the mapping of customer MACs to 
   Provider MAC(s). A topology change in the access (I-domain) should 
   just invoke the flushing of Customer MAC entries in PBB PEs' FIB(s) 
   associated with the I-VPLS(s) impacted by the failure. Further 
   optimizations may consider flushing just the Customer MAC addresses 
   that are mapped to a specific destination BMAC.  

   These goals may be achieved by adding the PBB TLV associated with the 
   affected I-VPLS(s) in the Address Withdraw message to indicate the 
   particular domain(s) requiring MAC flush. At the other end, the 
   receiving PBB PEs may use the ISID(s) and/or the BMAC information to 
   flush only the related FIB entry/entries (customer/I-domain) 
   associated with these I-SIDs and learnt via the bridges with these 
   BMAC addresses. 

               7.2. Flood Containment in the Backbone VPLS  

   PBB is using a special Backbone Group MAC (BMAC) address every time 
   flooding in the B-domain is required. This BMAC is built (see 
   [IEEE802.1ah]) using a group OUI assigned for PBB usage followed by 
   the ISID value in the last 24 bit of the MAC address. 

   As I-VPLS components are added to a certain Backbone VPLS, the new 
   components identifying the PBB Service Instance may be used to 
   advertise the presence of a specific ISID on a certain PBB PE and 
   throughout the BVPLS core. At the Backbone VPLS PEs, the ISID 
   information may be used to build a flooding tree in the data plane 
   that will deliver traffic through the BVPLS infrastructure just to 
 
 
Balus, et al.          Expires January 8, 2008                [Page 10] 

Internet-Draft         VPLS Extensions for PBB                July 2007 
    

   the PBB PEs where the IVPLS endpoints are present. The dissemination 
   of the ISID information is achieved through the use of PBB TLV.  

   The above procedure assumes the same ISID value is used to identify 
   the customer VPN across the BVPLS domain. Inter-provider scenarios 
   will be discussed in a future version of the document. 

8. Multicast Handling 

   PBB MAC hiding may create difficulties for identifying customer 
   Multicast exchanges. It is important to be able to support both 
   regular and PBB VPLSes. That way the customer VPNs requiring large 
   volume of Multicast may be addressed using regular VPLS, allowing for 
   easy multicast snooping throughout the VPLS infrastructure. 

   Alternatively, the optimization for Flood Containment may be expanded 
   to allow for efficient Multicast handling in the BVPLS 
   infrastructure: i.e. Group BMAC addresses may be assigned per 
   Multicast tree to ensure efficient Multicast distribution on a per I-
   VPLS basis.  

9. Resiliency 

   [IEEE802.1ah] recommends the use of Provider MSTP (P-MSTP) to ensure 
   loop free topology for connectionless forwarding throughout PBBN.  

   Using BVPLS infrastructure instead of native Ethernet core eliminates 
   the need for backbone P-MSTP through the use of a full mesh of PWs 
   with split-horizon and/or via the H-VPLS scheme (Primary/Standby PWs) 
   - see [RFC4762]. 

   On the access side, for a PB network or a CE device dually connected 
   to PBB PEs, a loop spanning both I and B domains may occur. An STP-
   based or a local mechanism may be used to break this loop.  

   A solution that does not imply running MSTP end-to-end may involve 
   the MAC Withdraw scheme described in the signaling section to speed-
   up data plane convergence upon topology changes. 

10. OAM  

   Existing VPLS OAM tools may be used in each I-VPLS and B-VPLS domain. 
   Details of the required OAM tools and the correlation between these 
   two domains are out of scope of this draft.
