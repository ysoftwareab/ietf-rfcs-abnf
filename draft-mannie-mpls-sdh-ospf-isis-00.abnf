N=3*M:

   Internetworking between STM-1 and STS-3c is simpler to implement
   since the two frames have the same structure. The standard SONET
   concatenation allows only the STS-N multiplexing where N is a
   multiple of 3. This helps with SDH internetworking. Internetworking
   between STM-Mc and STS-Nc, where N=3*M is also simple to implement.
