1.  Introduction

   The User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3) is specified in RFC 3414
   [RFC3414].  Within USM, two different authentication protocols, HMAC-
   MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96, are defined based on the hash functions MD5
   and SHA-1, respectively.  This memo specifies new HMAC-SHA-2
   authentication protocols for USM using an HMAC based on the SHA-2
   family of hash functions [SHA] and truncated to 128 bits for SHA-224
   and SHA-256, to 192 bits for SHA-256, to 256 bits for SHA-384 and
   SHA-512, and to 384 bits for SHA-512.  These protocols are
   straightforward adaptations of the authentication protocols HMAC-
   MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96 to the SHA-2 based HMAC.  The use and support
   of HMAC-SHA-224-128, HMAC-SHA-256-128, HMAC-SHA-256-192, HMAC-
   SHA-384-256, HMAC-SHA-512-256, and HMAC-SHA-512-384 authentication
   protocols is OPTIONAL.  An implementer can choose any subset of the
   protocols specified in this document - implementing one does not
   require to support the rest.

2.  The HMAC-SHA-2 Authentication Protocols

   This section describes the HMAC-SHA-2 authentication protocols.  They
   use the SHA-2 hash functions, which are described in [SHA] and
   [RFC6234], in HMAC mode described in [RFC2104] and [RFC6234],
   truncating the output to 128 bits for SHA-224 and SHA-256, 192 bits
   for SHA-256, 256 bits for SHA-384 and SHA-512, and 384 bits for
   SHA-512.  [RFC6234] also provides source code for all the SHA-2
   algorithms and HMAC (without truncation).  It also includes test
   harness and standard test vectors for all the defined hash functions
   and HMAC examples.

Internet-Draft             HMAC-SHA-2_Auth_USM                March 2014


   The following protocols are defined:

      usmHMACSHA224128AuthProtocol: uses SHA-224 and truncates the
      output to 128 bits (16 octets);

      usmHMACSHA256128AuthProtocol: uses SHA-256 and truncates the
      output to 128 bits (16 octets);

      usmHMACSHA256192AuthProtocol: uses SHA-256 and truncates the
      output to 192 bits (24 octets);

      usmHMACSHA384256AuthProtocol: uses SHA-384 and truncates the
      output to 256 bits (32 octets);

      usmHMACSHA512256AuthProtocol: uses SHA-512 and truncates the
      output to 256 bits (32 octets);

      usmHMACSHA512384AuthProtocol: uses SHA-512 and truncates the
      output to 384 bits (48 octets).

2.1.  Deviations from the HMAC-SHA-96 Authentication Protocol

   All the HMAC-SHA-2 authentication protocols are straightforward
   adaptations of the HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96 authentication
   protocols.  Precisely, they differ from the HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-
   SHA-96 authentication protocols in the following aspects:

   o  The SHA-2 hash function is used to compute the message digest in
      the HMAC computation according to [RFC2104], as opposed to the MD5
      hash function [RFC1321] and SHA-1 hash function [SHA] used in
      HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96, respectively.  Consequently, the
      length of the message digest prior to truncation is 224 bits for
      SHA-224 based protocol, 256 bits for SHA-256 based protocol, 384
      bits for SHA-384 based protocol, and 512 bits for SHA-512 based
      protocol.

   o  The resulting message digest (output of HMAC) is truncated to

      *  16 octets for usmHMACSHA224128AuthProtocol and
         usmHMACSHA256128AuthProtocol

      *  24 octets for usmHMACSHA256192AuthProtocol

      *  32 octets for usmHMACSHA384256AuthProtocol and
         usmHMACSHA512256AuthProtocol

      *  48 octets for usmHMACSHA512384AuthProtocol

Internet-Draft             HMAC-SHA-2_Auth_USM                March 2014


      as opposed to the truncation to 12 octets in HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-
      SHA-96.

   o  The user's secret key to be used when calculating a digest MUST
      be:

      *  28 octets long and derived with SHA-224 for the SHA-224 based
         protocol usmHMACSHA224128AuthProtocol

      *  32 octets long and derived with SHA-256 for the SHA-256 based
         protocols usmHMACSHA256128AuthProtocol and
         usmHMACSHA256192AuthProtocol

      *  48 octets long and derived with SHA-384 for the SHA-384 based
         protocol usmHMACSHA384256AuthProtocol

      *  64 octets long and derived with SHA-512 for the SHA-512 based
         protocols usmHMACSHA512256AuthProtocol and
         usmHMACSHA512384AuthProtocol

      as opposed to the keys being 16 and 20 octets long in HMAC-MD5-96
      and HMAC-SHA-96, respectively.

2.2.  Processing

   This section describes the procedures for the HMAC-SHA-2
   authentication protocols.  The descriptions are based on the
   definition of services and data elements defined for HMAC-SHA-96 in
   RFC 3414 [RFC3414] with the deviations listed in Section 2.1.

2.2.1.  Processing an Outgoing Message

   Values of constants M and N used below, are:

      usmHMACSHA224128AuthProtocol: M=28, N=16;

      usmHMACSHA256128AuthProtocol: M=32, N=16;

      usmHMACSHA256192AuthProtocol: M=32, N=24;

      usmHMACSHA384256AuthProtocol: M=48, N=32;

      usmHMACSHA512256AuthProtocol: M=64, N=32;

      usmHMACSHA512384AuthProtocol: M=64, N=48.

   correspondingly.

Internet-Draft             HMAC-SHA-2_Auth_USM                March 2014


   This section describes the procedure followed by an SNMP engine
   whenever it must authenticate an outgoing message using one of the
   authentication protocols defined above.

   1.  The msgAuthenticationParameters field is set to serialization,
       according to the rules in [RFC3417], of an OCTET STRING
       containing N zero octets.

   2.  From the secret authKey of M octets, calculate the HMAC-SHA-2
       digest over it according to HMAC [RFC6234].  Take the first N
       octets of the final digest - this is the Message Authentication
       Code (MAC).

   3.  Replace the msgAuthenticationParameters field with the MAC
       obtained in the previous step.

   4.  The authenticatedWholeMsg is then returned to the caller together
       with statusInformation indicating success.

2.2.2.  Processing an Incoming Message

   Values of the constants M and N are the same as in Section 2.2.1, and
   are selected based on which authentication protocol is configured for
   the given USM usmUserTable entry.

   This section describes the procedure followed by an SNMP engine
   whenever it must authenticate an incoming message using the
   usmHMACSHA256AuthProtocol.

   1.  If the digest received in the msgAuthenticationParameters field
       is not N octets long, then an failure and an errorIndication
       (authenticationError) is returned to the calling module.

   2.  The MAC received in the msgAuthenticationParameters field is
       saved.

   3.  The digest in the msgAuthenticationParameters field is replaced
       by the N zero octets.

   4.  Using the secret authKey, the HMAC is calculated over the
       wholeMsg.

   5.  N first octets of the above HMAC are taken as the computed MAC
       value.

   6.  The msgAuthenticationParameters field is replaced with the MAC
       value that was saved in step 2.

Internet-Draft             HMAC-SHA-2_Auth_USM                March 2014


   7.  The newly calculated MAC is compared with the MAC saved in step
       2.  If they do not match, then a failure and an errorIndication
       (authenticationFailure) are returned to the calling module.

   8.  The authenticatedWholeMsg and statusInformation indicating
       success are then returned to the caller.

3.  Key Localization and Key Change

   For any of the protocols defined in Section 2, key localization and
   key change SHALL be performed according to [RFC3414] using the SHA-2
   hash function applied in the respective protocol.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC3414] also apply to the use of all
   the HMAC-SHA-2 authentication protocols in SNMP.  A general
   discussion of the security of the HMAC construction is given in
   [RFC2104].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign OIDs for the objects defined in the
   snmpUsmHmacSha2MIB module under the SnmpAuthProtocols subtree,
   maintained in the registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-
   numbers.
