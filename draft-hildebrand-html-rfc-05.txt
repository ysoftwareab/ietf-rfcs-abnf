         HyperText Markup Language Request For Comments Format
                      draft-hildebrand-html-rfc-05

Abstract

   In order to meet the evolving needs of the Internet community, the
   format for RFCs is changing from a plain-text, ASCII-only format to a
   canonical XML format that will in turn be rendered into several
   publication formats.  This document defines the HTML format that will
   be rendered for an RFC or Internet-Draft.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on November 7, 2015.

1.  Introduction

   As described in [I-D.flanagan-rfc-framework], the RFC Series is
   changing.  One of those changes includes the RFC Editor publishing a
   non-canonical HTML version of RFCs.

   This memo describes the HTML format that will be used as one of the
   publication formats for the RFC Series.  It defines a strict subset
   of HTML appropriate for RFC Series documents.  The visual layout of
   the document will be defined through a cascading style sheet (CSS)
   [W3C.REC-CSS2-20110607].  The CSS will be included in the HTML file
   but will be described in a separate document.

2.  Requirements for the HTML Format

   o  This section lists the design requirements used to create the HTML
      format described in this document.  These requirements build on
      those found in [RFC6949].

   o  The HTML has to render correctly on a list of browser versions
      that the RFC Editor will keep up to date outside of this document.

   o  These requirements are expected to change in the future to reflect
      the expectation that HTML rendering will be required for current
      versions of browsers and platforms, while ideally continuing to
      render correctly on recent versions of those browsers.

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                        May 2015


   o  The HTML documents may be re-rendered from the canonical XML
      format in the future to ensure the ongoing readability of the
      documents.  The intent is that any re-rendering would be due to
      exceptional circumstances rather than for minor annoyances.

   o  The HTML must display adequately in at least one text-based
      browser.  Some consumers of the RFC series can only access the
      series on text- based terminals.

   o  The HTML document will be self-contained, without requiring
      external files for images, CSS, JavaScript, or the like.  This
      will allow the HTML file to be moved over various non-HTTP
      transports (such as e-mail, FTP, and rsync) without breakage.

   o  Any use of JavaScript in the HTML document must not be required
      for comprehensive reading of the document, because some consumers
      of the RFC series routinely disable JavaScript for security
      purposes.

   o  The HTML document will allow easy local override of the default
      CSS formatting.  This will allow users who have a different visual
      style that they prefer to make RFCs display with that style
      without having to alter the contents of the HTML document.  This
      might also be valuable for allowing people with specific
      accessibility needs to use a customized CSS.

   o  HTML tags in documents will rarely have attributes whose only
      purpose is to affect the rendered styling, and those will only be
      used if it would not be possible to specify that styling in CSS.
      No such attributes are known at this time.

   o  Both user-defined and auto-generated anchors must be supported and
      linkable, with user-defined anchors appearing in an "id"
      attribute.  Auto-generated anchors will be generated for every
      heading, paragraph, and so on, not just those that do not have
      user-defined anchors.  User-defined anchors may, and auto-
      generated anchors will, appear next to paragraphs, figures,
      tables, blockquotes, and section titles.

   o  All section, subsections, figures, and paragraphs should have
      stable numbered link anchors.  Additionally, anchors expressed in
      the source XML should be exposed as anchors in the HTML output as
      well.

   o  The HTML must make it easy to separate sections along with all of
      their subsections into separate files.  This will make creating
      EPUB documents easier in the future.

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                        May 2015


   o  The abstract must be marked up or tagged in a way that popular
      search engines will extract it as a summary.

   o  The format will consist of a subset of HTML deemed to be widely
      implemented by common browsers at the time the specification is
      created, likely to continue to be widely-implemented, and unlikely
      to cause security issues.  This will maximize the chances that
      future HTML renderers (such as new web browsers) will continue to
      produce readable text from the HTML format without the format
      needing to be changed frequently.

2.1.  Requirements for Accessibility

   o  Normative information must be easily accessible to the following
      consumers:

      *  People with impaired vision, including those that use large
         fonts and those that use screen readers

      *  People with difficulty distinguishing between colors

      *  People who use devices with small screens, such as cell phones

      *  Other groups to be determined later

   o  Specific instances where goals for accessibility are important in
      the design choices of the format have been called out in the text.

   o  NOTE: designing for these consumers does not preclude the use of
      features they cannot use, but does require that key semantic data
      is not lost when read using the tools and settings that are
      required by a given constituency.

3.  HTML Version

   The RFC Editor will periodically determine which version of the HTML
   specification will be referenced for tools generating the format
   defined in this document.  The starting version will be that defined
   in [W3C.REC-html5-20141028], commonly known as "HTML5".  Although the
   HTML specification mandates several of the syntax and structure rules
   described in this document, they are called out here for emphasis.

4.  HTML Syntax

   The processor emitting HTML from the XML source will follow these
   rules:

   o  The HTML output is encoded as UTF-8, as specified in [RFC3629].



Hildebrand, et al.      Expires November 7, 2015                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                        May 2015


   o  The document is valid HTML.

   o  Double quotes (U+0022 QUOTATION MARK: ") are used to quote
      attribute values unless the HTML specification forbids quoting a
      particular attribute.

   o  Each logical line is terminated solely with a \n (U+000A: LINE
      FEED), otherwise known as "Unix-style" line endings.

   o  Other than \n (U+000A: LINE FEED), code points less than " "
      (U+0020: SPACE) (otherwise known as "control characters") are not
      used.  Any character references that would generate these code
      points (such as &#0009;) may not be used.  NOTE: this rule
      explicitly forbids \t (U+0009: CHARACTER TABULATION), \f (U+000C:
      FORM FEED), and \r (U+000D: CARRIAGE RETURN) from appearing in the
      output.

   o  Comments in the canonical XML, if any, will not be copied into the
      HTML.

   o  The HTML output will be pretty-printed, using whatever consistent
      rules the tooling team deems best.

   NOTE: none of these rules affect the rendered output of the HTML, but
   are intended to increase the chance that difference tools that
   operate on the HTML output easier to write.

5.  Common Items

   The following items are common across multiple parts of the HTML
   document:

5.1.  IDs

   HTML elements that are generated from XML elements that include an
   anchor attribute will use the value of the anchor attribute as the id
   of the corresponding HTML element.  If there is no anchor attribute,
   the slugifiedName attribute of the contained <name> element will be
   used.  Otherwise, the partNumber attribute will be used, where it
   exists.

   Some HTML constructs (such as <section> (Section 9.45)) will use
   multiple instances of these identifiers.

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                        May 2015


5.2.  Pilcrows

   Each paragraph, artwork, or sourcecode segment outside of a <figure>
   or <table> element will be appended with a space and a "pilcrow"
   (U+00B6: PILCROW SIGN), otherwise known as a "paragraph sign".  For
   the purposes of clarity, in this document pilcrows are rendered as
   "&para;".

   The pilcrow will normally be invisible unless the element it is
   attached to is moused over.  The pilcrow will be surrounded by a link
   that points to the element it is attached to.

   Pilcrows are never included inside a <table> or <figure> elements,
   since the figure number or table number serve as adequate link
   targets.

   Elements that might otherwise contain a pilcrow do not get marked
   with a pilcrow if they contain one or more child elements that are
   marked with a pilcrow.  For example:

   <blockquote id="p-1.2-1">
     <p id="p-1.2-2">Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought
       forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and
       dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
       <a href="#p-1.2-2" class="pilcrow">&para;</a></p>
     <!-- NO pilcrow here -->
   </blockquote>

5.3.  ASCII Equivalents

   Many elements in the v3 schema in [I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc] contain
   attributes for ASCII equivalents of the Unicode text contained in the
   element or the Unicode attribute value.  These alternatives are
   included in a <span> tag with the class "ascii".  The <span> is
   included inside the tag that is showing the text to the user.  For
   example:

   <span class="surname">
     HILDEBRAND
     <span class="ascii">Hildebrand</span>
   </span>

6.  Front Matter

   The front matter of the HTML format contains processing information,
   metadata of various types, and styling information that applies to
   the document as a whole.  This section describes HTML that is not
   necessarily a direct transform from the XML format.  For more details

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                        May 2015


   on each of the tags that generate content in this section, see
   Section 9.

6.1.  DOCTYPE

   The DOCTYPE of the document is "html", which declares that the
   document is compliant with HTML5.  The document will start with
   exactly this string:

   <!DOCTYPE html>

6.2.  Root Element

   The root element of the document is <html>.  This element includes a
   lang attribute, whose value is a [RFC5646] language tag describing
   the natural language of the document.  The language of the RFC Series
   is English and so the language tag to be included is 'en'.

6.3.  Head Element

   The root <html> will contain a <head> element that contains the
   following elements, as needed.

6.3.1.  Charset Declaration

   In order to be correctly processed by browsers that load the HTML
   using a mechanism that does not provide a valid MIME content-type or
   charset (such as from a local file system using a "file:" URL), the
   HTML <head> element contains a <meta> element, with charset attribute
   with value "utf-8":

   <meta charset="utf-8"/>

6.3.2.  Document Title

   The contents of the <title> element from the XML source will be
   placed inside an HTML <title> element in the header.

6.3.3.  Document metadata

   The following <meta> elements will be included:

   o  author - comma-separated <fullname>s of all of the <author>s from
      the XML source

   o  description - the abstract from the XML source





Hildebrand, et al.      Expires November 7, 2015                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                        May 2015


   o  generator - the name and version number of the software used to
      create the HTML

   o  keywords - comma-separated <keyword>s from the XML source

   For example:

   <meta name="author" content="Joe Hildebrand,Heather Flanagan">
   <meta name="keywords" content="html,css,rfc">
   <meta name="description" content="This document defines...">
   <meta name="generator" content="xmljade v0.2.4">

6.3.4.  Style

   The <head> element contains an embedded CSS style sheet in a <style>
   element.  The styles in the style sheet are to be set consistently
   between documents by the RFC Editor, according to the best practices
   of the day.

   To ensure consistent formatting, individual style attributes are not
   used in the main portion of the document except in highly exceptional
   circumstances; each use of such attributes will be individually
   justified.

   Different readers of a specification will desire different formatting
   when reading the HTML versions of RFCs.  To facilitate this, the
   <head> element also includes a <link> to a style sheet in the same
   directory as the HTML file, named "rfc-local.css".  Any formatting in
   the linked style sheet will override the formatting in the included
   style sheet.  For example:

   <style>
     body {}
     ...
   </style>
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="rfc-local.css">

6.3.5.  Links

   Each link (Section 9.30) from the XML source is copied into the
   header.

6.4.  Document Information

   Information about the document as a whole will appear as the first
   child of the HTML <body> element, embedded in an HTML <dl> element
   with id="identifiers".  The defined terms in the definition list are

   "Workgroup:", "Series:", "Status:", "Published:", and "Authors:".
   For example:

   <dl id="identifiers">
     <dt>Workgroup:</dt>
       <dd class="workgroup">rfc-interest</dd>
     <dt>Series:</dt>
       <dd class="series">Internet-Draft</dd>
     <dt>Status:</dt>
       <dd class="status">Informational</dd>
     <dt>Published:</dt>
       <dd><time datetime="2014-10-25"
                 class="published">2014-10-25</time></dd>
     <dt>Authors:</dt>
       <dd class="authors">
         <div class="author">

         <div class="author">
           <span class="initial">H.</span>

           (<span class="organization">RFC Editor</span>)</div>
       </dd>
   </dl>

6.5.  Table of Contents

   The table of contents will follow the boilerplate if the <rfc>
   element's tocInclude attribute has the value "true".  An <h2> heading
   containing the text "Table of Contents" will be followed by a <nav>
   element that contains a <ul> element for each depth of the section
   hierarchy.  Each section will be represented by a <li> element
   containing links by the section number (from the pn attribute) and by
   the name (from the slugifiedName attribute of the <name> child
   element).  Each <nav>, <ul>, and <li> element will have the class
   "toc".

   For example:

   ...

7.  Main Body

   The main body of the document is processed according to the rules in
   Section 9.

8.  Back Matter

   The back matter of the HTML document includes an index (if
   generated), information about the authors, and further information
   about the document itself.

8.1.  Index

   The index will be produced at the end of the document (before the
   author information) if and only if the <rfc> element has a
   indexInclude attribute with the value "true", and there is one or
   more <iref> elements in the document.

8.1.1.  Index Contents

   The index section will start with an <h2> heading containing the text
   "Index", followed by links to each of the lettered portions of the
   index.  Links are not generated for letters that do not occur as the
   first letter of an index item.

   For example:

   <h2>Index</h2>
   <div class="index">
     <div class="indexIndex">
       <a href="#rfc.index.C">C</a>
       <a href="#rfc.index.P">P</a>
     </div>
     ...

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                        May 2015


8.1.2.  Index Letters

   The index index is followed by a <ul> tag that contains a <li> tag
   for each first letter represented in the index.  This <li> tag has
   the class indexChar, and contains an <a> tag with the id pointed to
   by the index index, as well as an href to itself.  The <li> tag also
   includes a <ul> tag that will contain the index items.

   For example:

   <ul>
     <li class="indexChar">
       <a href="#rfc.index.C" id="rfc.index.C">C</a>
       <ul>
         <!-- items go here -->
       </ul>
     </li>
     ...

8.1.3.  Index Items

   Each index item can have multiple <iref> elements to point to, all
   with the same item attribute.  Each index item is represented by a
   <li> tag of class indexItem containing a <span> of class irefItem for
   the item text and one of class irefRefs for the generated references
   (if there is at least one reference to the item not having a
   subitem).  Each generated reference contains an <a> tag containing
   the section number where the <iref> was found, with an href pointing
   to the irefid of the <iref>.  If the primary attribute of the <iref>
   has the value "true", the <a> tag will have the class indexPrimary.
   Commas may be used to separate the generated references, surrounded
   by a <span> tag with class indexComma.

   For example:

   <li class="indexItem">
     <span class="irefItem">Bullets</span>
     <span class="irefRefs">
       <a class="indexPrimary" href="#s-Bullets-1">2</a>
       <span class="indexComma">,</span>
       <a href="#s-Bullets-2">2</a>
     </span>
     <!-- subitems go here -->
   </li>
   ...

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                        May 2015


8.1.4.  Index Sub-items

   If an index item has at least one subitem, the <li> of that item will
   contain a <ul>, with one <li> for each subitem, of class
   indexSubItem.  Each subitem is formatted similarly to items, except
   the class of the first <span> tag is irefSubItem.

   For example:

   <ul>
     <li class="indexSubItem">
       <span class="irefSubItem">Ordered</span>
       <span class="irefRefs">
         <a href="#s-Bullets-Ordered-1">2</a>
       </span>
     </li>
   </ul>
   ...

8.2.  Authors' Addresses

   At the end of the document, author information will be included
   inside an HTML <section> element.  The class names have been chosen
   to match the class names in hCard [1].

   Note: The following example shows several ASCII equivalents that are
   the same as their nominal equivalents for clarity; normally the ASCII
   equivalents would not be included for these cases.

   <section id="author-addresses">
     <h2>
       <a class="self-ref" href="#author-addresses">

8.3.  Document Information

   A few bits of metadata about the document that are less important to
   most readers are included after the author information.  The style
   sheet might de-emphasize their display, or hide them altogether.

   The finalized time is copied from the <rfc> element's prepTime
   attribute.  The rendered time is the time that this HTML was
   generated.

8.4.  XML Source

   At the very end of the document, the XML source that was used to
   produce this document will be included within a comment.  This
   comment may be preceded by another comment that describes the source.

   Any instances of "--" in the XML will be modified to use U+002D
   characters: "--".  Note that if the dashes in the original XML were
   in a comment start- (<!--) or end-delimiter (-->), the XML will not
   parse correctly without reversing this transformation.

   <!-- XML SOURCE START (note: each instance of
        two '-' (U+002D: HYPHEN-MINUS) characters
        changed to "&#x2d;&#x2d;") -->

9.  Elements

   This section describes how each of the XML elements from
   [I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc] is rendered to HTML.  Many of the descriptions
   have examples to clarify how elements will be rendered.

9.1.  <abstract>

   The abstract is rendered similarly to a <section> (Section 9.45) with
   anchor="abstract" and <name>Abstract</name>, but without a section
   number.

     <p id="p-abstract-1">This document defines...
       <a href="#p-abstract-1" class="pilcrow">&para;</a>
     </p>
   </section>

9.2.  <address>

   This element is used in Authors' Addresses (Section 8.2).

9.3.  <annotation>

   This element is rendered as a span of class "annotation" at the end
   of a reference (Section 9.40), the span containing appropriately-
   transformed elements from the children of the <annotation> tag.  A
   span of class "comma" is added before the annotation.

   <span class="comma">,</span>
   <span class="annotation">
     You <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> read this annotation.
   </span>

9.4.  <area>

   Not currently rendered to HTML.

9.5.  <artwork>

   Artwork can either consist of inline text or SVG.  If the artwork is
   not inside a <figure> element, a pilcrow (Section 5.2) is included.
   Inside a <figure> element, the figure title serves the purpose of the
   pilcrow.

9.5.1.  Text Artwork

   Text artwork is rendered inside an HTML <pre> element, which is
   contained by a <div> element for consistency with SVG artwork.  Note
   that CDATA blocks do not work consistently in HTML, so all <, >, and
   & must be escaped as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;, respectively.

   The <div> element will have CSS classes of "artwork" and "art-"
   prepended to the value of the <artwork> element's "type" attribute,
   if it exists.

9.5.2.  SVG Artwork

   SVG artwork MUST be included inline.  The SVG is wrapped in a <div>
   element with CSS classes "artwork" and "art-svg".

   Note: the alt attribute of <artwork> is not currently used for SVG;
   instead, the <title> and <desc> tags are used in the SVG.

   <div class="artwork art-svg" id="p-2-17">
     <svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

     </svg>
     <a href="#p-2-17" class="pilcrow">&para;</a></pre>
   </div>

9.5.3.  Other Artwork

   Other artwork will have a src attribute whose value begins with
   "data:".  Such artwork is rendered in an HTML image element.

   Note: such images are not yet allowed by the RFC Series Editor, even
   though the format supports them.

9.7.  <author>

   As seen in Authors' Addresses (Section 8.2), at the end of the
   document, each document author is rendered into an HTML <address>
   element with the CSS class "vcard".

   The HTML <address> element will contain an HTML <div> with CSS class
   "namerole".  That div will contain an HTML <span> element with CSS
   class "fn" containing the value of the "fullname" attribute of the
   <author> XML element, and an HTML <span> element with CSS class
   "role" containing the value of the "role" attribute of the <author>
   XML element (if there is a role).  Parentheses will surround the
   <span class="role">, if it exists.

9.9.  <bcp14>

   This element marks up words like MUST and SHOULD with an HTML <span>
   element with the CSS class "bcp14".

   You <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be joking.

9.10.  <blockquote>

   This element renders as the similar HTML <blockquote> element.  If
   there is a "cite" attribute, it is copied to the HTML cite attribute.
   If there is a "quoteFrom" attribute, it is placed inside a <cite>
   element at the end of the quote, with an <a> element surrounding it
   (if there is a "cite" attribute), linking to the "cite" URL.

   If the blockquote does not contain another element that get a pilcrow
   (Section 5.2), a pilcrow is added.

   Note that the "--" at the begining of the <cite> element should be a
   proper emdash, which is difficult to show in the current format of
   this format.

   <blockquote id="p-1.2-1"
     cite="http://...">
     <p id="p-1.2-2">Four score and seven years ago our fathers
       brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived

   HTML, so all <, >, and & must be escaped as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;,
   respectively.  If the input XML has a "type" attribute, another CSS
   class of "lang-" and the type is added.

   If the sourcecode is not inside a <figure> element, a pilcrow

11.  Security Considerations

   Since RFCs are sometimes exchanged outside the normal Web sandboxing

   loaded from a local file, more care must be taken with the HTML than
   is ordinary on the web.
