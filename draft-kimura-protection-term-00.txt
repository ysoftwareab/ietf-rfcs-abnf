Abstract

   This document addresses terminology and metrics for the performance
   benchmarking of lower-layer protection systems: Automatic Protection
   Switching (APS) for SONET/SDH, the Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) for
   Ethernet, and Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) for just below
   the IP-layer.  The benchmarks describe system performance in the IP-
   layer.

1. Introduction

   Reliability is needed for the IP networks of today, because the
   Internet has already become an important communication
   infrastructure, and quality-sensitive applications are being used on
   it.  To improve IP-layer reliability, protection technologies are
   implemented in lower layers.  Automatic Protection Switching (APS) is
   for SONET/SDH, the Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) is for Ethernet, and
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is for just below the IP-layer.
   Recovery time in IP-layer is different from that in lower layers
   because of the mechanism for recognizing when interfaces go up and
   down and the buffering effect of IP routers.  Protection performance
   specifications and methodologies for testing them are required to
   provide for the objective comparison of implementations.  Performance
   metrics are based on effects in the IP layer; different protection
   technologies are thus made comparable.

        least, the dedicated recovery path (1+1) or shared recovery path
        (m:n).

3.2.3 Protection Switching

    Definition:
        The detection of path failures and response to path failures by
        switching of the active path from the working path to recovery
        path.  A protection-switching scheme includes mechanisms for
        failure detection and switch-over.

3.2.5 Protection System

    Definition:
        A system which consists of two or more protection-capable nodes
        connected to each other by both working paths and recovery
        paths.

    Discussion:
        When a path failure occurs, the system detects the failure and
        switches the active path from the failed working path to the
        recovery path.  Some technologies for this are in lower layers:
        MPLS-based recovery, SONET/SDH-based recovery and Optical path
        recovery [5]-[8].

3.3 Reference Model for Protection Benchmarking

3.3.1 Pseudo-Failure Equipment

    Definition:
        Equipment which creates a pseudo path failure after receiving a
        signal from a tester.

    Discussion:
        An item of pseudo-failure equipment is used in benchmarking
        protection systems, since it provides more reliable and
        reproducible testing than actual path failure.

3.3.3 Reference Model for Protection Benchmarking

    Definition:
        A fundamental model which is used in benchmarking protection
        systems.  A System Under Test (SUT) consists of two protection-
        capable nodes connected by both a working path and a recovery
        path.  An item of pseudo-failure equipment is placed at a point
        along the working path.  A tester is set outside the two nodes
        and generates IP traffic.  The tester also sends the triggers
        for protection that cause the item of pseudo-failure equipment
        to simulate path failures.

    Discussion:
        Figure 1 shows the reference model for protection benchmarking.
        A SUT consists of two protection-capable nodes connected by both
        a working path and a recovery path.  The working path includes
        pseudo-failure equipment inside.  A tester, which is placed
        outside the two nodes, continuously sends IP packets that
        include sequence numbers and time stamps to one of the nodes and
        receives packets from the other node.  After the tester sent a
        trigger for protection to the pseudo-failure equipment, the
        system detects the failure and switches from the failed working
        path to the recovery path.  The tester records the sequence
        numbers and time stamps in the IP packets as well as the packet-
        reception times, during the time protection switching takes to
        detect and finish responding to a failure.

3.4.6 Additive Latency

    Definition:
        Difference between working-path latency and recovery-path
        latency.

    Discussion:
        If a recovery path takes more hops than a working path, the
        latency is increased by protection switching.

3.4.8 Loss-of-Service Time

    Definition:
        Loss-of-Service Time is defined as the time taken to switch-over
        to a recovery path and to restart the forwarding of packets
        after a path failure.

    Discussion:
        Loss-of-service time may be the sum of the failure-detection and
        switch-over times.  This time is derived from Loss of Service
        and the input traffic rate.

3.4.9 Recovery Time

    Definition:
        Recovery time is defined as the time when protection switching
        in response to a path failure is finished and stability is
        restored to the forwarding of packets: abnormal and abnormally
        received packets (lost, bit-error, out-of-order, and duplicated)
        are no longer present, induced latency is decreased, and latency
        becomes stable.

    Discussion:
        Recovery time may be the sum of the failure detection time,
        switch-over time and time taken for the system to be stabilized.
