1.  Introduction

   This document describes the service-specific implementation and
   requirements for Pseudo-Wires Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) of TDM
   circuits.  It discusses the emulation of circuits (such as T1, E1, T3
   and E3) over packet networks using IP, L2TP or MPLS.  It is
   structured as an extension to [MALIS].

   See [PATE] and [XIAO] for background, motivation and requirements
   concerning circuit emulation over PSNs.  [MARTINI] and [MALIS]
   provide information on the very similar emulation of SONET circuits.

   Figure 1 below shows a pair of T1s being carried over a TDM/SONET
   network.  The node marked "M" is an M13 multiplexer, while the nodes
   marked "S" are SONET ADMs.  Note that the physical T1s are terminated
   at the M13 and SONET ADM, but the framing and payload are carried
   transparently to the hub site.

   Figure 2 below shows the same pair of T1s being carried over a packet
   network.  Here the emulation is performed by the boxes marked "E",
   and the routers marked "R" carry the resulting packets.  Note that
   the emulation, routing and/or SONET functions could be combined in
   the same device.  Such combinations are likely, so an encapsulation
   format should be easy to incorporate into such applications and
   devices.

3.  Encapsulation Overview

3.1.  Packet Format

   Section 4 of [MALIS] defines a mapping for SONET SPEs into a format
   for transport over various Packet Switched Networks (PSNs).  That
   format is extended here to sub-SPE rates using the standard VT
   (virtual tributary) mapping mechanism.  The format for a TDM CEP
   (Circuit Emulation over Packet) packet is shown in Figure 3 below.

   The "PSN Header" could be an IP or GRE header, MPLS label or L2TP
   header.  See section 4 of [MALIS] for a description of the overall
   structure, and for the definition of the CEP Header.  The format of
   the "TDM Data" is described in the following sections.

3.2.  TDM Encapsulation

   This document builds upon existing standards for defining its
   encapsulations.  The SONET VT mapping for DS1/T1, E1, DS1C and DS2
   into VT1.5, VT2, VT3 and VT6 is defined in [GR253].  [G.707] defines
   the mapping of T1s, E1s and DS2 into VC-11, VC-12 and VC-2 containers
   within the SDH hierarchy.  Mapping of E3 and T3 into SDH VC-3
   container and to the SONET STS-1 container are defined as well.  Both
   synchronous and asynchronous mappings are defined for E1s and T1s.
   These mapping are well known and widely used for various
   applications.  This draft extends SONET/SDH circuit emulation [MALIS]
   to carry the tributary TDM signals.

   In order to save paper and wear and tear on the reader's eyeballs,
   SONET terminology is used throughout this document.  All SONET
   discussions are applicable for SDH terminology as well.

   An example of VT1.5 mapping into an STS-1 SPE is shown in Figure 4
   below.

                   Figure 4: SONET SPE Mapping of VT1.5

   The SPE always contains seven interleaved VT groups (VTGs).  Each VTG
   contains a single type of VT, and each VTG occupies 12 columns (108
   bytes) within each SPE.  A VTG can contain 4 VT1.5s (T1s), 3 VT2s
   (E1s), 2 VT3s or a single VT6.  Altogether, the SPE can carry 28 T1s
   or carry 21 E1s.  SONET carries DS3 signals within a single STS-1,

Internet Draft           draft-pate-pwe3-tdm-02        November 21, 2001

   The encapsulations described in this document use SONET containers to
   carry TDM signals.  Three formats are defined in this document:

   o The VT encapsulation maps a single T1, E1, DS1C or DS2 into a VT
     and then into packets.

   o The fractional STS-1 encapsulation defined herein can carry any
     number of VTs up to the maximal allowed within a single STS-1.

   o A DS3 is encapsulated within an STS-1 container and sent over an
     STS-1 emulated circuit.

   These encapsulations are described in more detail in the following
   sections.

4.  VT Encapsulation

   The VT encapsulation carries a single VT1.5 (T1), VT2 (E2), VT3 or
   VT6 circuit.  Structured and unstructured modes are supported.

4.1.  Multi-frame Format

   VTs are organized in SONET multi-frames, where a SONET multi-frame is
   a sequence of four SONET SPEs.  The SPE path overhead byte H4
   indicates the SPE number within the multi-frame.  The VT overhead
   bytes (V1, V2, V3 and V4) of each VT occupy the same SPE byte at a
   fixed position in SPEs 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the multi-frame,
   respectively.  The VT data can float relative to the SPE position.
   The VT overhead bytes V1, V2 and V3 are used as pointer and stuffing
   byte similar to the use of the H1, H2 and H3 TOH bytes.  V4 is
   currently unused.

   The structured VT mode does not carry the overhead bytes V1-V4 within
   the payload, but rather maps them into the CEP pointer and N/P
   indications.  The CEP pointer indicates the V5 byte within the
   payload.  The unstructured mode carries these overhead bytes within
   the payload, and uses the pointer to indicate the beginning of the
   multi-frame byte by pointing to the V1 byte.

   Figure 5 below indicates the number of bytes occupied by a VT within
   a multi-frame.

           Mapping   Bytes per Multi-frame         Reference
        -------------------------------------------------------------
           VT1.5         108 bytes           [GR253] section  3.4.1.1
           VT2           144 bytes           [G.707] section 10.1.4.1
           VT3           216 bytes           [GR253] section  3.4.1.3
           VT6           432 bytes           [GR253] section  3.4.1.4

Internet Draft           draft-pate-pwe3-tdm-02        November 21, 2001

   Each CEP packet carries a fixed payload size that can go up to a
   single SONET multi-frame.  This limitation is due to the restriction
   of carrying only one pointer within each CEP header.  In particular,
   a VT1.5 emulation packet can carry up to 108 bytes of payload in
   unstructured mode and up to 104 bytes in structured mode (leaving out
   V1-V4).

4.2.  VT Header

   The basic VT CEP header is defined in Figure 6 per section 4 of
   [MALIS]:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |0|R|D|N|P| Structure Pointer[0:12] |  Sequence Number[0:13]      |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                   Figure 6: Basic VT CEP Header Format

   The following fields are used within the header:

   o R bit: RDI indication.  The RDI indication is sent whenever a
     remote defect indication needs to be sent to the far side.

   o D bit: Support for DBA mode for unequipped and AIS indication
     payload.  See [MALIS] for more details.

   o N/P bits: (structured mode only) Indicate negative and positive
     pointer adjustment events.  They are also used to relay SONET/SDH
     maintenance signals such as AIS-V.  N indicates a negative pointer
     event, and P indicates a positive pointer event.  Both N and P are
     set to 1 to indicate AIS-V signal.

   o Structure pointer:

     -  In structured mode, the Structure Pointer MUST contain the
        offset of the V5 byte within the VT Fragment.  A value 0 means
        the first byte after the CEP header.  The maximal structure
        pointer value corresponds to the maximal number of VT bytes
        contained within a multi-frame, minus the 4 overhead bytes.  The
        Structure Pointer MUST be set to 0x1FF if a packet does not
        carry the V5 byte.

     -  In unstructured mode, the Structure Pointer MUST contain the
        offset of the V1 byte within the VT Fragment.  Value 0 means the
        first byte after the CEP header.  The maximal structure pointer
        value corresponds to the maximal number of VT bytes contained
        within a multi-frame.  The Structure Pointer MUST be set to
        0x1FF if a packet does not carry the V1 byte.

5.  Fractional STS-1 Encapsulation

   The fractional STS-1 encapsulation carries VTs within an STS-1
   container.  The STS-1 container includes the path overhead bytes, and
   the normal SONET encapsulation is used.  The additional benefit in
   using the fractional STS-1 encapsulation is that it does not require
   sending any unused VTs.

   The fractional STS-1 encapsulation can optionally carry a bit mask
   that specifies which VT is carried within the STS-1 payload and which
   VTs have been removed.  This optional bit mask attribute allows the
   ingress circuit emulation node to remove an unequipped VT on the fly,
   providing the egress circuit emulation node enough information for
   reconstructing the VTs in the right order.  In particular, the
   fractional STS-1 encapsulation can be used as a compressed version of
   the STS-1 encapsulation defined in [MALIS].

5.1.  Fractional STS-1 Mapping

   Figure 7 below shows a mapping of 3 VT1.5s, designated 1-1, 2-1 and
   3-1.  Note that the fixed stuffs shown in Figure 4 are not sent when
   using this mode.

                 Figure 7: Fractional SPE Mapping of VT1.5

   Note that Figure 7 shows the bytes from the VTs interleaved, as with
   the SONET SPE shown in Figure 4.  This interleaving reduces the
   buffering required at the ingress and egress PEs.  It also helps
   simplify the construction of combined PW/ADM PEs to operate in
   networks such as that shown in Figure 2.  The "fractional" SPE in
   Figure 7 could be expanded out to a full SPE by the addition of

   "dummy" VTs, Path Overhead and fixed stuffs.

   Section 3.3.3 of [GR253] states that "Four bytes (V5, J2, Z6 and Z7)
   are allocated for VT POH."  The same section also defines how these
   bits are set.

5.2.  Fractional STS-1 CEP header

   The fractional STS-1 CEP header uses the STS-1 CEP header
   encapsulation as defined in [MALIS].  Optionally, an additional 4
   byte header extension word is added.  The extended header is
   described in Figure .  The E bit is set to 1 to indicate use of the
   extended header [MALIS]

                Figure 8: Extended fractional STS-1 Header

   The following fields are used within the extended header:

     o  R, D, N, P, Structured Pointer, Sequence Number: All fields are
        used as defined in [MALIS] for STS-1 encapsulation.

     o  E: Extension bit.  E = 1 indicates that extended header is used.
        E = 0 indicates that extended header is not carried within the
        packet.

     o  Unequipped Bit Mask: Each bit within the bit mask refers to a
        different VT within the STS-1 container.  Bit zero refers to the
        first VT within the STS-1 SPE.  For an STS-1 carrying VT1.5s,
        all 28 bits are used.  For an STS-1 carrying VT2s, only the
        first 21 bits are used.  A bit set to 0 indicates that the
        fractional STS-1 payload carries the corresponding VT.

5.3.  BIP

   The B3 byte within the POH indicates the bit wise parity of the
   payload.  In applications where the Path is terminated at the PE
   (i.e. the fractional STS-1 is used to carry TDM signals between the
   ingress and egress emulation edges), the B3 is generated and should
   equal the bit-wise parity of the VTs carried within the fractional
   STS-1 payload.  In applications where the Path is not terminated at
   the PE (i.e. the fractional STS-1 is used to carry a compressed
   STS-1), the B3 value should be modified to reflect the removal of the
   unequipped VTs.  Let B3* be the bit wise parity of the removed
   unequipped VTs, and let B3p be the value carried within the

Pate et al.                 Expires May 2002                   [Page 10] 

Internet Draft           draft-pate-pwe3-tdm-02        November 21, 2001

   fractional STS-1 payload.  Then B3p = B3 || B3*, where || indicates a
   bit-wise OR operation.  The egress PE can reconstruct the unequipped
   VTs and modify the B3p value in the same manner to accommodate for
   the additional VTs added.  In this way the end-to-end B3 parity is
   preserved.

6.  DS3 Encapsulation

   A DS3 is encapsulated into an STS-1 SPE using the format defined in
   sections 3.4.2.1 (synchronous) and 3.4.2.2 (asynchronous) of [GR253].
   The STS-1 SPE is then encapsulated as defined in section 4 of
   [MALIS].

7.  Operational Considerations

7.1.  Time Slot Assignment (TSA)

   For an application like that shown in Figure 2, it may be desirable
   to change the TSA for a given VT.  For example, an operator may
   desire to take an E1 appearing in the first VT on the ingress side
   and place it in a different E1 on the egress side.  The PE MAY allow
   the operator to configure the assignment of Time Slots at each end of
   the PW.

7.2.  Timing

   See section 8 of [MALIS].

7.3.  Loopbacks

   When operating in a structured mode, a PE SHOULD process loopback
   messages as defined in [T1.403].  This allows better isolation of
   faults in a network.  It also facilitates the certification of
   equipment for operation in a carrier's network.

   There are also inband loopbacks that are used for voice equipment.
   These are falling out of favor due to their incompatibility with data
   services.  A PE that implements inband loopbacks must have the
   capability to disable them.

7.4.  Performance Processing

   [T1.403] defines a Network Performance Report Message (NPRM) that
   carries periodic reports on the performance of the link.  A PE
   operating in a structured mode SHOULD generate these messages, as
   they are frequently used for surveillance and trouble-shooting.

7.5.  LOS/AIS

   A TDM multiplexer, switch or other path-terminating device generates
   AIS in the downstream direction in response to a LOS or LOF
   condition.  This is done by sending a certain pattern in the data

Pate et al.                 Expires May 2002                   [Page 11] 

Internet Draft           draft-pate-pwe3-tdm-02        November 21, 2001

   stream.  Bandwidth can be saved by suppressing the AIS signal in the
   emulated stream and sending instead an indication in the control
   overhead.  [MALIS] discusses the propagation of AIS using the pointer
   bits in the TDM control word.

   A PE emulating TDM circuit must either replicate the AIS indication
   or indicate this condition in the control overhead.

7.6.  Session Multiplexing

   Session multiplexing is accomplished by use of the PW label shown in
   Figure 3.

8.  Security Considerations

   See section 11 of [MALIS].
