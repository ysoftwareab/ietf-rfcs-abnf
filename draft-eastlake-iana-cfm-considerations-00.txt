Abstract

   IEEE 802.1 has specified Continuity Fault Management (CFM) OAM
   facilities. CFM messages are structured with an Op-Code field and
   have provision for the inclusion of TLV (type, length, value)
   structured information. IEEE 802.1 has allocated blocks of CFM Op-
   Codes and TLV Types to the IETF. This document specifies the IANA
   Consideration for the assignment of values from these blocks.

INTERNET-DRAFT                    IANA Considerations for CFM Codepoints


1. Introduction

   The IEEE 802.1 Working Group has specified Continuity Fault
   Management (CFM) [802.1Q] OAM [RFC6291] facilities. CFM messages are
   structured with an Op-Code field and have provision for the inclusion
   of TLV (type, length, value) structured information.

   IEEE 802.1 has allocated the block of 32 CFM Op-Codes from 64 through
   95 and the block of 32 CFM TLV Types from 64 through 95 to the IETF.
   This document specifies the IANA Consideration for the assignment of
   values from these two blocks.

   IEEE 802.1 previously allocated similar blocks of the values from 32
   through 63 to ITU-T [Y.1731].



1.1 Terminology

   Capitalized IANA Considerations terms such as "Standards Action" are
   to be interpreted as described in [RFC5226].

2. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create an "CFM OAM IETF Parameters" Registry
   with two registries as follows:


         Registry Name: CFM OAM IETF Op-Codes

         Registration Procedures: Standards Action

         Reference: [802.1Q] [this document]

         Note: This parameter originates with the IEEE 802.1 Working
         Group that has allocated the block of values from 64 to 95 to
         the IETF.

         Value    Assignment    Reference
         =====    ==========    =========
         64-95    Unassigned    [this document]


         Registry Name: CFM OAM IETF TLV Types

         Registration Procedures: Standards Action

         Reference: [802.1Q] [this document]

         Note: This parameter originates with the IEEE 802.1 Working
         Group that has allocated the block of values from 64 to 95 to
         the IETF.

         Value    Assignment    Reference
         =====    ==========    =========
         64-95    Unassigned    [this document]



3. Security Considerations

   This document is concerned with assignment of values from the blocks
   of IEEE 802.1 CFM Op-Codes and TLV Types that the IEEE 802.1 Working
   Group has allocated to the IETF. It is not directly concerned with
   security.
