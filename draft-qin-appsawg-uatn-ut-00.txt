      Upload Acceleration Transport Network for Upstream Traffics
                      draft-qin-appsawg-uatn-ut-00

Abstract

   Moving data center closer to end users can provide numerous benefits
   for pre-uploaded content: lower latency, increased robustness of
   delivery, and improved quality of user experience.  For these
   reasons, many Online Storage Service Providers(OSSPs),Photos Sharing
   Service Providers (PSSPs), and Videos Sharing Service
   Providers(VSSPs), etc., are scaling up their infrastructure, and many
   above Upload Service Providers(USPs)are also deploying their own
   cloud platforms to improve data upload rate.  It is generally
   desirable that a given content item generated by end users can be
   quickly and robustly delivered to the destination regardless of that
   end user's location or attachment network.  This is the motivation
   for deploying Upload Acceleration Transport Network(UATN) so it can
   propose an open content delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end
   delivery of content from end users to the destination(data center or
   another end user, etc.).  However, no standards or open
   specifications currently exist to facilitate such an upload
   acceleration mechanism.

   The goal of this document is to explain the proposed UATN in detail
   for providing public upload acceleration service and interconnect
   existing upload acceleration systems as an open content delivery
   infrastructur.

1.  Introduction

   Traditional Internet data services are frequently that end users
   download content from data centers or Content Service Providers
   (CSPs) distribute their content to the customers, so upstream traffic
   volume generated by end users accounts for very small proportion of
   total Internet traffics.  However, as smart mobile devices and cloud
   services are proliferating, the direction of the Internet traffic
   volume is changing.  First, more and more mobile users like directly
   uploading and sharing their photos, videos, documents and other data
   by data centers.  Second, many OSSPs enter the market and provide
   free and larger storage space,in the meantime the emerging mobile
   devices are fully cloud-dependent that are not equipped with much
   storage but rely on large storage in data centers.  Third, some
   Service Providers (SPs) allow content delivery among their end users,
   one user can deliver content to another via Internet.  So upstream
   traffic grows drastically these days and expected to continue doing
   so in the future.

   Unfortunately, inherent limitations in the Internet's architecture
   make it difficult to achieve desired levels of performance natively
   on the Internet.  Designed as a best-effort network, the Internet
   provides no guarantees on end-to-end reliability or performance.  On
   the contrary, wide-area Internet communications are subject to a
   number of bottlenecks that adversely impact performance, including
   latency, packet loss, network outages, inefficient protocols, and
   inter-network friction.  In addition, existing acceleration
   technologies, such as CDNI[RFC6707], DECADE[RFC6390], that focus on
   content distribution do not necessarily apply to upstream traffic,
   upload service usually incurs poor user experience.  According to the
   report in [1], throughput measurements from over 3.1 million mobile
   devices have shown that compared with an average downstream
   throughput of over 3580 Kbps, the average upstream throughput is only
   about 630 Kbps.

   To improve user experience and overcome this challenge of massive
   upstream traffic, USPs are scaling up their infrastructure, and many
   USPs are also deploying their own cloud platforms to improve data
   upload rate.  It is generally desirable that a given content item
   generated by end users can be quickly and robustly uploaded to the
   destination regardless of that end user's location or attachment
   network.  However, a given USP's infrastructure may not have a
   footprint that expands close enough to the end user's current

   location or attachment network,or may not be better at that type
   content processing, to realize the user experience and cost benefit
   that a more efficient upload acceleration transport system would
   allow.  This is the motivation for deploying UATN so that it can
   provide public upload acceleration service, and can also interconnect
   existing standalone upload infrastructures so that their collective
   acceleration footprint can be leveraged for the end-to-end delivery
   of content from end users to the destination.  As an example, a VSSP
   could contract with a UATN Provider for the uploading of content, and
   that UATN Provider should assign one or more appropriate edge servers
   receiving the content on behalf of the VSSP.  And at last, the
   optimal route may be chosen to deliver the content to the VSSP's data
   center.

   A typical end-to-end content upload acceleration scenario may involve
   the following business arrangements:

   o  A business arrangement between the end user and the USP,
      authorizing upload content by the end users to the USP' data
      center.

   o  A business arrangement between the USP and an UATN Provider where
      the USP mandates that the UATN Provider perform the content
      receiving on behalf of the USP.

   o  A business arrangement between the UATN Provider and another (or
      other) UATN Provider(s) so that so they can interoperate as an
      open content delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery
      of content.

   The formation and details of any business relationships between a USP
   and a UATN Provider as well as between one UATN Provider and another
   UATN Provider are out of scope of this document.  However, this
   document concerns itself with the fact that no standards or open
   specifications currently exist to facilitate such UATN for upstream
   traffic from a technical perspective.

   One possible flow for performing an end-to-end content upload through
   UATN is described below:

   o  The initial content upload request from an end user is redirected
      to UATN.

   o  The UATN may assign the best edge server(s) (e.g., an edge server
      that is "closer" to the end user) receiving the end user's
      content.

   o  The content may be preprocessed by edgs server(s) according the
      policy of the destination data center.

   o  The UATN may choose the optimal route to deliver the content to
      the destination data center.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

   Upload Service Provider (USP):The service provider who operates data
   servers or cloud service that allows end users to directly upload or
   share their content, such as photos, videos, or other documents
   generated by them.  The content may be stored temporarily, or
   downloaded by other end users,or directly forwarded to another end
   user.  Note that a given entity may operate in more than one role.
   For example, a company may simultaneously operate as a USP,a CSP,
   etc.

   Upload Acceleration Transport Network (UATN): A transport network
   between end users and data centers that enables cache servers to
   provide content upload services on behalf of the USP.  A UATN may be
   wholly or partially realized through a set of cache servers and
   transport system with control and communication components.

   UATN Provider: The service provider who operates a UATN and offers a
   service of content upload acceleration, typically used by USPs.  Note
   that a given entity may operate in more than one role.  For example,a
   company may simultaneously operate as a USP,a CDN Provider, and a
   UATN Provider, etc.

2.  Use Cases and Scenarios

2.1.  End User to Data Center Use Case

   An example is depicted in Figure 1, where USP has deployed its own
   UATN or established an agreement with UATN Provider for the uploading
   of this content.  When a given end user requests uploading content to
   USP's data center, the UATN may allow the end user to directly upload
   the content to its cache server.  UATN also selects the optimum cache
   server to serve this uploading.  For instance, UATN considers that
   the Cache-1 is appropriate, because Cache-1 is an access cache and
   the end user is directly attached to it[RFC6770].  Through the UATN
   arrangements put in place between USP and end user(as a result of the
   upload acceleration service agreement established between USP and
   UNTA Provider),UATN can redirect the request to Cache-1 and the
   content is actually delivered to the USP's data center by UATN.

   End users benefit from this arrangement through a better
   QoE[RFC6390], because the content is uploaded to a nearby surrogate
   (e.g., lower latency, bottlenecks avoided)[RFC6707].  USPs benefit
   because they do not need to deploy such an extensive data server,
   they only need to make one business agreement and one technical
   arrangement with UATN Provider, but their end users can get a high
   service quality.  TSPs benefit because they do not need to expand the

   uplink bandwidth, and the upstream throughputs can be improved from
   end use's perspective.  To extend the example, other ASPs, such as
   CDN Providers may also benefit from this arrangement.  They can make
   their existing CDNs to provide upload services so that the upstream
   bandwidth can be fully used, and may receive some compensation for
   the delivery.

2.2.  End User to End User Use Case

   In this scenario, USP wishes to allow content delivery among its end
   users with high speed.  Consider the following example,illustrated in
   Figure 2: EU-1 wants to deliver content to EU-2, however, there may
   have a long "data path" between EU-1 and EU-2, such as TSPN, MANs,
   WANs, etc.  This will cause large delay and inversely proportional
   TCP throughput.  One technique for improving the user seen throughput
   is to introduce UATN between the sender and the receiver.  UATN
   resolves the problem by separating the current delivery communication
   into two parts, front-end service from the EU-1(the sender) to UATN
   and back-end service from the UATN to EU-2 (the receiver) to reduce
   access network and/or inter-network hop delay.

   As an example, suppose a French person wants to deliver content to
   the end user located in Africa.  The USP of this French user can ask
   a UATN Provider to provide acceleration that content generated by the
   French people will be first forwarded to the UATN Cache-1 and then is
   delivered to UATN Cache-2 through UATN's high reliability and
   performance transport system.  At last, the content is actually
   deliver to African user by UATN's Cache-2.

2.3.  Footprint Extension Use Cases

   In this use case, the USPs want to extend the infrastructure to
   support active users rapid growth:

   o  without compromising the quality of upload.

   o  keeping additional transit and other network costs at a reasonable
      level that receives content from geographically or topologically
      remote end users.

   o  without incurring the cost of deploying and operating data centers
      and the associated infrastructure that may not be justified in the
      corresponding geographic region (e.g., because of relatively low
      delivery volume, or conversely because of the high investments
      that would be needed to satisfy the high volume).

   In addition,if USPs have a geographically limited footprint (e.g.,
   restricted to one country), or do not serve all end users in a
   geographic area, they can also establish an agreement with a UATN
   Provide to provide their services beyond their own footprint.

   As an example, suppose a French USP wants to provider upload service
   to end users located in various countries in North Africa.  It can
   make an agreement with UATN Provider that covers North Africa instead
   of deploying its own data center in North Africa.  Overall, from the
   end use's perspective, the French USP provides an upload service for
   the whole North Africa with high data rate.  If there are several
   USPs that have make an agreement with the UATN Provider, cost will
   keep at a reasonable level, as shown in Figure 3.

2.4.  Offload Use Case

   A USP's access server or servers is/are likely to be dimensioned to
   support an expected maximum traffic load.  However, unexpected spikes
   in content popularity (flash crowd) may drive load beyond the
   expected peak.  The USP may use UATN so that some requests may be
   redirected to UATN to increase its effective capacity during the peak
   of traffic.

   For example, a USP can offload traffic to UATN for the duration of a
   specific maintenance operation or a special event, as in the scenario
   depicted in Figure 4.  For instance, during a major event, such as a
   celebrity's wedding or a major sport competition, many people in a
   confined space may deliver and upload photos, video related to this
   event, the USP and TSP are likely to experience a flash crowd during
   the event and will need to offload traffic.  While UATN can support a

   more typical traffic load and be able to handle the offloaded
   traffic.

2.5.  Public Colient Use Case

   One user tends to use multiple cloud services because each USP may
   provide different better functionality: e.g. one USP may be better at
   file processing, and another USP may be better at video processing.
   So one user needs to use multiple similar clients for high data
   upload rate(Because some USPs may use their own proprietary
   transmission protocols for maximizing throughput).  In this use case,
   UATN can provide public acceleration service for end user to avoid
   install multiple similar clients on their end devices.  UATN could
   preprocess the pre-uploaded content according the policy of the
   destination data center, such as transmission protocol, chunking
   strategy, etc.

   As an example, suppose USP1 provides videos sharing service, using
   HTTP as the carrier protocol.  USP2 provides photos sharing service,
   using HTTPs as the carrier protocol, as in the scenario depicted in
   Figure 5.  End user can upload both videos and photos quickly via
   internet explorer based on HTTP protocol.  First, the content will be
   uploaded to the UATN based HTTP.  Second, the UATN could send these
   content to the destinations respectively and adapts the carrier
   protocol accordingly.

3.  Upload Acceleration Transport Network Approach

   The UATN is a distributed system consisting of lots of widely
   deployed servers to enable the delivery of highly scalable
   distributed applications.  UATN is comprised of multiple delivery
   networks, each tailored to a different type of content.  For example,
   picture content, streaming media, or static web content.  At a high
   level, UATN shares a similar architecture, which is shown in
   Figure 6, but the underlying technology and implementation of each
   system component may differ in order to best suit the specific type
   of content.

   The main components of UATN are as follows:

   When the user types a USP's domain name into his/her browser, the
   domain name is translated by the mapping system into the IP address
   of an edge server to serve the content (arrow I).  The mapping system
   should collect and analysis historical and current data regarding the
   virtual network and server conditions.  This data is used to choose
   an edge server that is located close to the end user.

   Each edge server is part of the edge server platform, a distributed
   deployment of servers located in many sites.  These servers are
   responsible for processing requests from nearby EUs and receiving
   content generated by them (arrow 2).  Edge server may also preprocess
   the content according the policy of the destination.

   In order to respond to a request from a user, the UATN must deliver
   the content stored by edg server/servers to the designated data
   center.  The transport system is used to deliver content between edge
   server platform and designated data center in a reliable and
   efficient manner.  More generally, the transport system is
   responsible for moving data and content over the long-haul Internet
   with high reliability and performance.

   The communications and control system is used for disseminating
   status information, control messages, and configuration updates in a
   fault-tolerant and timely fashion.

   Finally, the user control portal serves two functions.  First, it
   provides a configuration management platform that allows a USP to
   retain fine-grained control how the content is uploaded to their data
   center by the end user.  These configurations can be told timely to
   the edge platform via the communications and control system.  Note
   that this configuration management applies to the third party UATN
   providers, if a USP deploys its own UATN, the configuration
   management platform can be omitted.  In addition, the user control
   portal provides a redirection approach of user request that redirects
   the upload request to the UATN.

   While all of UATN incorporates the component outlined above, the
   specific design of each system is influenced by application
   requirements.  For instance, the transport system of a UATN will have
   a different set of requirements and a different architecture.

4.  New Protocol Considerations

   This document does not call for changes or additions: any new
   session, transport or network protocols; new protocols for delivering
   content from a UATN to an End User/User agent.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document focuses on approach and the motivational use cases for
   UATN, and does not analyze the associated threats.  Those threats
   will be discussed in future.

6.  History

   This draft had been submitted to the TSVWG (Transport Area Working
   Group) once in May 28, 2015.  Because, as a CDN-related draft, UATN
   should belong in the TSV Area.  This is the link,
   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-qin-tsvwg-uatnut/.

   Unfortunately, in June, 2015, the IETF Area into which the CDNI WG
   was moved, and the CDNI WG was moved into "Applications and Real-
   Time" Area.  Although, this time I have updated this draft, the
   version number is still named to "00".
