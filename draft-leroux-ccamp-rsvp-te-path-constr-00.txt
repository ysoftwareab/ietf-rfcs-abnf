      Abstract 
          
         In various situations, it would be useful to include path parameters 
         such as delay, jitter, number of hops, cost, optical power, within 
         Generalized MPLS signaling. For that purpose, this draft extends 
         GMPLS RSVP-TE, for signaling path constraint, and accumulating path 
         parameters. It defines protocol elements and procedures, that allow 
         signaling path_constraints and accumulating path parameters along the 
         signaled path.

         This draft only defines generic encoding rules and procedures. 
         Specific encoding and procedures for each path parameter such as 
         delay, hop count, jitter will be addressed in separate documents.

      Internet Draft  draft-leroux-ccamp-rsvp-te-path-const-00.txt   
                                           

         GMPLS control plane (see [GMPLS-ARCH]) supports routing and signaling 
         of TE-LSPs for various switching technologies (PSC, L2SC, TDM, LSC, 
         FSC). Those generalized TE LSPs are routed along paths that respect a 
         set of TE constraints. Various TE constraints can be taken into 
         account during path computation, such as, for instance, bandwidth, 
         delay, hop-counts, and resource affinities.  
          
         There are two types of TE constraints: 
              - Link constraints: bandwidth, affinities, etc. 
              - Spatial Path_Constraints: delay, jitter, hop count, etc. 
              - Spectral Path Constraints: polarization, signal power, etc. 
          
         Some GMPLS Path_Constraints such as jitter apply only to statistical 
         multiplexing layers (PSC, L2SC). Some constraints such as 
         polarization or signal power, applies only to photonic layers. Some 
         other constraints such as hop count apply to any switching layer. 
          
         GMPLS Path parameters such as delay, hop count, signal power result 
         from the combination of link parameters. Their composition can be a 
         simple accumulation / reduction function but this may be a more 
         complex function. For instance the delay of a path is simply the 
         accumulation of hop delays. 
          
         Current Generalized RSVP-TE [RFC3473] signals, and performs local 
         admission control based on link constraints only. Path_Constraints 
         are not signaled within RSVP-TE.  
          
         However there are some cases where it would be useful to signal paths 
         constraints, and combine link parameters values along the path, in 
         order to perform an admission control a tail-end LSR, based on 
         Path_Constraints. This includes the following cases: 
          
                - The TE-LSP path has been computed taking into account 
                  Path_Constraints, but with incomplete information on link 
                  parameters, or estimated link parameters. In that case it 
                  is useful to signal path constraint, and combine link 
                  parameters along the path, to let the tail-end perform 
                  admission control based on signaled constraints with 
                  respect to the composition of the corresponding link 
                  parameter(s). Also it is also useful to reflect actual path 
                  parameters value back to the Head-End LSR. 
                 
                - In case of inter-domain LSP it may be useful to signal 
                  Path_Constraints, and accumulate link parameters, so that a 
                  border router can take them into account when doing ERO 
                  expansion (case of per-domain path computation in [INTER-
                  DOMAIN-COMP]).  
       
         This draft defines Generalized RSVP-TE protocol extensions to allow 
         for signaling of Path_Constraints, and accumulation of link 
         parameters along the path.

         The document is built as follows: 
          
         - Section 3 gives an overview of the solution.  
         - Section 4 defines a new Path Constraint TLV, to be carried within  
           the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE object, and used to encode Path 
           Constraints. 
         - Section 5 defines a new object called the COMPOSITION object, used  
           to build path parameters based on a composition of link parameters  
           along the signaled path.  
         - Finally, section 6 defines elements of procedures for head-end,  
           transit, and tail-end LSRs. 
          
         This document only defines generic encoding and procedures. Specific 
         encoding, procedures and accumulation rules is path parameter such as 
         delay, hop count, jitter and LSP class specific and will be addressed 
         in separate documents. 
          
      3. Overview of the Mechanism 
          
         As mentioned in the previous section, it would be useful in various 
         situations to signal Path_Constraints such as maximum delay or 
         maximum hop count (in particular during for loose paths), within 
         RSVP-TE, and to combine link parameters along the path, in order to 
         determine path parameters such as path delay or path hop count. 
          
         A new Path Constraints TLV is defined for being carried within the 
         LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE object [LSP-ATTR]. It is used to carry 
         particular value such as upper or lower bounds for a set of path 
         parameters or a value range. Values are fixed by the head-end LSR and 
         are not modified along the path. 
          
         A new COMPOSITION object is defined to compose link parameter values 
         and determine end-to-end significant parameters along the path of the 
         LSP. It is updated at each hop, basically each hop combines received 
         value with its own contribution to the path parameter.  
          
         The procedure to signal an LSP with Path_Constraints is as follows: 
          
           - The head-end sends a Path message that includes: 
                - A Path Constraints TLV, included in a LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE    
                  object, that encodes for each path constraint a set of      
                  parameters.                                                 
                - An COMPOSITION object that contains a set of path           
                  parameters, initially set to the least significant value.   
                 
           - At each transit LSR, each value included in the COMPOSITION      
             object value is updated based on local hop contribution to       
             each path parameter. It is assumed that the composition function  
             is uniquely defined for each of these parameters.                
       
           - The tail-end LSR performs admission control for each             
             parameter included in the Path_Constraints TLV. For each

             parameter, the composed value in the COMPOSITION object is       
             compared with the constraint value included as part of the Path  
             Constraints TLV. 
             
             Admission control formulas are specific to each parameter        
             and are not addressed in this document. If all constraints       
             are acceptable by the tail-end LSR, the later sends back a       
             Resv message, reflecting the COMPOSITION object that is passed  
             unchanged back to the head-end LSR.  
       
           - In case one (or more) constraints are violated, the tail-end LSR  
             sends a PathErr message with the Path_State_Removed flag set  
             [RFC3473], and with a new Error code and value that indicates the  
             violated constraint. The PathErr message also includes the  
             COMPOSITION object that is passed unchanged back to the head-end  
             LSR. 
          
      4. Path_Constraints TLV 
       
      4.1. Description 
       
         The Path_Constraints TLV is defined as a new Attribute TLV of the LSP 
         REQUIRED ATTRIBUTE object. It exactly follows the processing rules 
         defined in [LSP-ATTR]. 
          
         It contains a set of Path Parameter sub-TLVs, each encoding the 
         constraint value for a given path parameter. Path Parameter sub-TLVs 
         are to be specified on a per QoS service basis. 
       
      4.2.  Format 
       
         The Path Constraints TLV is encoded as follows 
       
          0                   1                   2                   3

         IANA has been asked to manage the space of TLV types in the 
         REQUIRED_LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object [LSP-ATTRIB]. This document suggest 
         Type = 2 for the Path Constraints TLV.

         Type: 
          
              The identifier of the path parameter. 
          
         Length: 
          
              The length of the value field in bytes. Thus if no value field 
              is present the length field contains the value zero. 
               
              Each value field must be zero padded at the end to take it up 
              to a four byte boundary - the padding is not  included in the 
              length so that a one byte value would be encoded in an eight  
              byte TLV with length field set to one. 
          
         Path Parameter Value: 
          
              Scalar value of the path parameter. The unit will depend on  
              on the type of parameter and will be defined in the document 
              that introduces the parameter. 
       
      4.3. Elements of procedure 
       
         An LSR that does not recognize a parameter type in the Path 
         Constraint TLV MUST reject the Path message using a Path Error with 
         Error Code "Unknown Path Parameter" and Error Value set to the 
         parameter type.  
          
         To avoid high rejection rate, a break bit (X) is introduced. 
         Moreover, as values can be correlated to deliver a given service, it 
         is expected that the processing of this bit will be defined such that 
         it applies to the set of the corresponding Path Parameter sub-TLVs.

      5. The COMPOSITION object 
       
         The COMPOSITION object is used to build path parameters, by combining 
         hop parameters along the signaled path. 
          
         It is carried within a Path message and updated at each hop. This 
         object is also be carried in Resv and PathErr message, where it is 
         passed unchanged, with no update at any hop. 
          
      5.1. Format 
       
         The COMPOSITION object contains a set of Composed Path Parameter TLVs 
         whose encoding is defined in 2.2.1, each TLV corresponding to a given 
         accumulated parameter along the path.  
          
         Note that a given parameter must have the same type, when carried in 
         the LSP_REQUIRED ATTRIBUTE object or in the COMPOSITION object. 
          
         Class = 10bbbbbb,  C-Type = Composed Path Parameter TLVs

         5.2. Elements of procedure 
          
         The ACCUMLATOR object has a C-Num of form 10bbbbbb. That is, an LSR 
         that does not recognize this object should discard it silently. 
       
      Leroux et al.    Standard Track - Expires March 2006         [Page 7] 
        

      Internet Draft  draft-leroux-ccamp-rsvp-te-path-const-00.txt   
                                           

         An LSR that recognize this object but does not recognize a path 
         parameter should set the break bit X. It is upon tail-end LSR 
         decision (and subsequently the head-end LSR) to decide whether a non-
         complete composition is satisfactory or not for the whole Path. 
       
      6. Procedures to setup a TE-LSP with Path_Constraints 
       
      6.1. Procedure for the Head-End LSR 
       
         To signal a LSP subject to a set of path_constraints, the head-end 
         LSR sends a Path message that contains a Path Constraints TLV 
         included within a LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE object. Path_constraints are 
         encoded within Path Parameter sub-TLVs. 
          
         Note that the type of constraints and constraint values may be 
         subject to change during the life of the LSP but are under full 
         control of the head-end LSR. 
          
         The Path message sent by the head-end LSR also contains an 
         COMPOSITION object. Values in path parameters TLVs are initialized 
         following rules specific to each parameter. These specific rules are 
         out of the scope of this document, and will be addressed in documents 
         introducing the parameters. 
          
         Note that all path parameters present in the Path_Constraints TLV, 
         MUST also appear in the COMPOSITION Object. In return some path 
         parameters not subject to admission control may be present in the 
         COMPOSITION object, and not in the Path_Constraints TLV. 
          
         On receipt of a Resv message with a COMPOSITION object, the head-end 
         LSR will be aware of the current LSP path parameters. The processing 
         of these values by the Head-End LSR will be addressed in documents 
         defining the path parameters. 
          
      6.2. Procedure for a transit LSR 
       
         A Transit LSR MUST update each path parameter of a COMPOSITION object 
         received in a Path message, and forward the updated object in the 
         Path message sent downstream. Basically, for each path parameter it 
         should combine the received value with its own "contribution" to the 
         parameter. Combination rule depend on the parameter type, and must be 
         addressed in the document defining the path parameter. 
           
         When its local contribution changes, a transit LSR SHOULD send a Path 
         message downstream with an appropriately updated COMPOSITION object.   
          
         A COMPOSITION object included in a Resv message MUST be forwarded 
         transparently by a transit LSR. 
          
         The Path_Constraints TLV included in a Path/Resv message MUST be 
         forwarded transparently by a transit LSR.

      6.3. Procedure for tail-end LSRs 
          
         On receipt of a Path message containing a COMPOSITION object and no 
         Path_Constraints TLV, a tail-end LSR MUST reflect the COMPOSITION 
         object unchanged in a Resv message upstream to the head-end LSR.  
          
         On receipt of a Path message containing both a COMPOSITION object and 
         a Path_Constraints TLV in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE object, the 
         tail-end LSR MUST perform an admission control for each path 
         parameter constraint in the Path_Constraints TLV. Each path parameter 
         constraint must be compared, with the accumulated parameter value. 
         Comparison rules will be addressed in documents defining the path 
         parameters. 
          
         If no constraint is violated, the COMPOSITION object MUST be 
         reflected unchanged in a Resv message sent upstream. 
          
         If at least one constraint is violated, the LSP must be rejected, and 
         the tail-end LSR must send a PathErr message with the 
         Path_State_Removed flag set, and with a new Error code (path 
         constraint violation, and error value corresponding to the violated 
         constraint.  
          
         This PathErr message MUST also reflect the COMPOSITION object 
         unchanged.

      8. IANA Consideration 
       
       
      8.1. New RSVP C-Num and C-Type 
          
         One new RSVP C-Num is defined in this document and should be 
         assigned by IANA. 
          
            o COMPOSITION object 
          
         The C-Num should be of the form 10bbbbbb so that LSRs that do not 
         recognize the object will ignore the object and discard it silently. 
          
         One C-Type is defined for this object and should be assigned by IANA. 
          
              o Path Parameter TLVs 
          
                Recommended C-Type value 1.

      8.2. New LSP Attributes TLV 
          
         This document defines one LSP Attributes TLV type as     
         follows: 
            - TLV Type Suggested value = 2 
            - TLV Name = Path_Constraints 
            - allowed on LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object. 
       
      8.3. New Path Parameters TLV Space:  
          
         The COMPOSITION object and the Path Constraints TLV defined above are 
         constructed from TLVs. Each TLV correspond to a particular path 
         parameter. Each TLV includes a 16-bit type identifier (the T-field). 
         The same T-field values are applicable to the COMPOSITION object and 
         the Path Constraints TLV. 
          
         IANA is requested to manage TLV type identifiers as follows: 
          
            - TLV Type (T-field value) 
            - TLV Name 
          
      8.4. New Error Codes 
       
         This document defines the following new error codes and error values. 
         Numeric values should be assigned by IANA. 
          
         Error Code                     Error Value 
          
         "Unknown Path parameter TLV"  Identifies the unknown TLV type code. 
         "Path Constraint Violaton"    Identifies the TLV type of the violated   
                                       constraint. 
          
      8.5. Security issues 
          
         This document adds one new object to the RSVP Path/Resv message, and 
         a new TLV to the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE object. 
          
         It does not introduce any new direct security issues and the reader 
         is referred to the security considerations expressed in [RFC2205], 
         [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].
