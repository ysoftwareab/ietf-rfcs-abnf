              draft-ietf-netconf-restconf-client-server-03

Abstract

   This document defines two YANG modules, one module to configure a
   RESTCONF client and the other module to configure a RESTCONF server.
   Both modules support the TLS transport protocol with both standard
   RESTCONF and RESTCONF Call Home connections.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines two YANG [RFC7950] modules, one module to
   configure a RESTCONF client and the other module to configure a
   RESTCONF server [RFC8040].  Both modules support the TLS [RFC5246]
   transport protocol with both standard RESTCONF and RESTCONF Call Home
   connections [RFC8071].

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data models is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Braces "{" and "}" enclose feature names, and indicate that the
      named feature must be present for the subtree to be present.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  The RESTCONF Client Model

   EDITOR NOTE: Please ignore this section, it is incomplete.

   The RESTCONF client model presented in this section supports both
   clients initiating connections to servers, as well as clients
   listening for connections from servers calling home.

   This model supports the TLS transport protocol using the TLS client
   groupings defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-tls-client-server].

   All private keys and trusted certificates are held in the keystore
   model defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

   YANG feature statements are used to enable implementations to
   advertise which parts of the model the RESTCONF client supports.

2.2.  Example Usage

   The following example illustrates configuring a RESTCONF client to
   initiate connections, as well as listening for call-home connections.

   This example is consistent with the examples presented in Section 2.2
   of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

3.  The RESTCONF Server Model

   The RESTCONF Server model presented in this section supports servers
   both listening for connections as well as initiating call-home
   connections.

   This model supports the TLS transport protocol using the TLS server
   groupings defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-tls-client-server].

   All private keys and trusted certificates are held in the keystore
   model defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

   YANG feature statements are used to enable implementations to
   advertise which parts of the model the RESTCONF server supports.

3.2.  Example Usage

   The following example illustrates configuring a RESTCONF server to
   listen for RESTCONF client connections, as well as configuring call-
   home to one RESTCONF client.

   This example is consistent with the examples presented in Section 2.2

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document uses a grouping defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-tls-client-server].  Please see the Security
   Considerations section in that document for concerns related that
   grouping.

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via YANG based management protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS) with mutual
   authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC6536] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      NONE

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      NONE

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      NONE

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document registers two URIs in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registrations are
   requested:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-client
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-server
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

5.2.  The YANG Module Names Registry

   This document registers two YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC7950].  Following the format in [RFC7950], the the
   following registrations are requested:

      name:         ietf-restconf-client
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-client
      prefix:       ncc
      reference:    RFC XXXX

      name:         ietf-restconf-server
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-server
      prefix:       ncs
      reference:    RFC XXXX

Appendix A.  Change Log

A.1.  server-model-09 to 00

   o  This draft was split out from draft-ietf-netconf-server-model-09.

   o  Added in new features 'listen' and 'call-home' so future
      transports can be augmented in.

A.2.  00 to 01

   o  Renamed "keychain" to "keystore".

A.3.  01 to 02

   o  Filled in previously missing 'ietf-restconf-client' module.

   o  Updated the ietf-restconf-server module to accomodate new grouping
      'ietf-tls-server-grouping'.

A.4.  02 to 03

   o  Refined use of tls-client-grouping to add a must statement
      indicating that the TLS client must specify a client-certificate.

   o  Changed restconf-client??? to be a grouping (not a container).
