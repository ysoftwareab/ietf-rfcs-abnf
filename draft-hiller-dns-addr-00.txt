1. Abstract 
    
   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method for 
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP 
   defines an extensible Link Control Protocol and a family of Network 
   Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring different 
   network-layer protocols. 
    
   This document extends the NCP for establishing and configuring 
   Version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPV6) over PPP, defining the 
   negotiation of primary and secondary Domain Name System (DNS) server 
   IPV6 addresses. 
    
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

3. Introduction 
    
   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for 
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP 
   defines an extensible Link Control Protocol and a family of Network 
   Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring different 
   network-layer protocols. 
    
   This document extends the NCP for establishing and configuring 
   Version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPV6) [4] over PPP, defining the 
   negotiation of primary and secondary Domain Name System (DNS) server 
   addresses [3] [7] for IPV6. 
    
    
4. Additional IPV6CP Configuration Options 
    
   The two name server address configuration options, X to X+1, provide 
   a method of obtaining the addresses of Domain Name System (DNS) 
   servers on the remote IPV6 network. 
    
   For implementation convenience, these options are designed to serve 
   identical purposes, except that when both are present an attempt 
   SHOULD be made to resolve names using the primary address before 
   using the secondary address. 
    
    
    
4.1 Primary DNS Server IPV6 Address 
    
   Description 
    
   This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with the 
   remote peer the IPV6 address of the primary DNS server to be used on 
   the local end of the link.  If the local peer requests an invalid 
   server address (which it will typically do intentionally) the remote 
   peer specifies the address by NAKing this option, and returning the 
   Ipv6 address of a valid DNS server.   
    
   By default, no primary DNS address is provided. 
    
   A summary of the Primary DNS IPV6 Address Configuration Option format 
   is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

        Primary-DNS-IPV6-Address 
         
             The sixteen octet Primary-DNS-Address is the address (in 
             network byte order) of the primary DNS server to be used 
             by the local peer.  If all sixteen octets are set to zero, 
             it indicates an explicit request that the peer provide the 
             address information in a Config-Nak packet. 
         
        Default  
         
             No address is provided. 
    
    
4.2 Secondary DNS Server IPV6 Address 
    
   Description 
    
   This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with the 
   remote peer the IPV6 address of the secondary DNS server to be used 
   on the local end of the link.  If local peer requests an invalid 
   server address (which it will typically do intentionally) the remote 
   peer specifies the address by NAKing this option, and returning the 
   IPV6 address of a valid DNS server. 
    
   By default, no secondary DNS address is provided. 
    
   A summary of the Secondary DNS Server IPV6 Address Configuration 
   Option format is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left 
   to right.

        Secondary-DNS-IPV6-Address  
    
             The sixteen octet Secondary-DNS-IPV6-Address is the IPV6 
             address (in network byte order) of the secondary DNS 
             server to be used by the local peer.  If all sixteen 
             octets are set to zero, it indicates an explicit request 
             that the peer provide the address information in a Config-
             Nak packet. 
         
        Default 
         
             No Address is provided. 
    
    
5. Security Considerations 
 
   The use of these extensions is as secure as the link itself.
