Internet-Draft       Calendar subscription upgrades        February 2021


2.  Introduction

   Currently clients subscribe to calendar feeds as an iCalendar file
   which is often published as a resource accessible using the
   unofficial 'webcal' scheme.

   The only available option for updating that resource is the usual
   HTTP polling of cached resources using Etags.

   There is the usual tension between clients wishing to see a timely
   response to changes and servers not wishing to be overloaded by
   frequent requests for possibly large amounts of data.

   This specification introduces an approach whereby clients can
   discover a more performant access method.  Given the location of the
   resource as an iCalendar file, the client can perfom a HEAD request
   on the resource and inspect the returned headers which will offer a
   number of alternative access methods.

   Given that many clients and servers already support CalDAV this
   provides an easy upgrade path for those clients.  Additionally an
   enhanced GET protocol is specified here to allow a light weight
   implementation.

   The use of subscription upgtafe may help reduce load on servers, but
   perhaps more inportantly it allows mobile devices to use a more
   efficient update mechanism reducing data tranferred and presumably
   improving battery life.

2.1.  Terms and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Additionally, the rule for URI is included from [RFC3986].

3.  Discovering alternative access methods

   The advertising of other access points is achieved through the use of
   the LINK header as defined in [RFC5988].  New link relation types are
   defined in this specification - each being associated with a protocol
   or protocol subset.

   These LINK headers will be delivered when a client carries out a HEAD
   request targeting the URL of the resource.

   EXAMPLE

   This is an example of a HEAD request and the response from a server
   that supports the enhanced GET method.

       >> Request <<

       HEAD /caldata/events.ics HTTP/1.1
       Host: example.com
       Accept: text/calendar

       >> Response <<

       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       Content-Length: xxxx
       Link: <http://example.com/subscribe/events.ics>;
                    rel="subscribe-enhanced-get"

                                  Figure 1

   Note that the target for an upgraded service may be the same as for
   the initial resource.

4.  Enhanced GET

4.1.  General

   This is a lightweight protocol which allows simple clients to
   efficiently discover and download changes in the targeted resource.

   It has many similarities to WebDAV sync and for a server could be
   implemented as an extension of the specification.

   In this protocol the client MUST include the Prefer header field
   preference "subscribe-enhanced-get".  If a sync token is available it
   is passed as a Sync-Token header field.

   The resource is treated as a set of individual events each of which
   may be updated or deleted separately.  The client will first fetch
   the entire iCalendar file.  On subsequent requests it uses the Prefer
   header field and a Sync-Token header field to indicate that it wants
   a set of changes since the last fetch.

   If no Sync-Token header field is supplied the server SHOULD respond
   with a full set of data.  Otherwise, if the token is valid, it SHOULD
   return with a set of changed entities.

Internet-Draft       Calendar subscription upgrades        February 2021


   In both cases the server should set the Preference-Applied header
   field and a new Sync-Token header field value.

4.2.  Deletions

   When an entity (VEVENT, VTODO or other valid top-level component) is
   deleted from the source data the server needs to be able to inform a
   client of the deletion.  This specification introduces a new value
   for the STATUS property of DELETED.

   On the first enhanced GET after the entity has been deleted a
   skeleton, but valid, entity will be returned with STATUS: DELETED.
   The receiving client is free to remove the entity or update it's
   STATUS property.

   On subsequent fetches the entity will not be returned.

4.3.  Handling of invalid sync tokens

   When a server receives an invalid token it MUST return a 409 status
   (Conflict).  The server MAY choose to return an error message in the
   body.

   The client SHOULD respond to this error by restarting the interaction
   from scratch, i.e. retrieve the full set of data then poll for
   updates.

4.4.  Paging the response

   A client may explicitly request a limit on the size of the response
   by specifying the Prefer header field preference "limit=n" where n is
   the number of components.

   When a server receives a request specifying such a limit it SHOULD
   limit the response to that number of components.  If the limit causes
   a truncation in the response the server should respond with a
   Preference-Applied header specifying the limit that was applied and
   return a sync token which may be used to retrieve the next batch of
   data.

   This allows the client to immediately resubmit a request for the next
   batch using the updated token.

   A server MAY choose to limit the response size.  The behavior SHOULD
   be as if the client had provided a preference for that size -
   allowing the client to retrieve the full set of data in batches.

4.5.  Caching of responses

   To enable proper caching of responses the server SHOULD provide a
   VARY header field in responses that names the Prefer and Sync-Token
   header fields along with any other that are appropriate.

   Clients should order the preferences as following so that identical
   responses can be identified:

   *  subscribe-enhanced-get

   *  limit

4.6.  Examples

   EXAMPLE 1

   This is an example of the initial request and response from a server
   that supports the enhanced GET method.  Note the use of the Vary
   header so a caching proxy can key off the client's Sync-Token and
   preference.

       >> Request <<

       GET /events.ics HTTP/1.1
       Host: example.com
       Accept: text/calendar
       Prefer: subscribe-enhanced-get

       >> Response <<

       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       Content-Length: xxxx
       Sync-Token: "data:,1234567"
       Preference-Applied: subscribe-enhanced-get
       Vary: Prefer, Sync-Token

       BEGIN:VCALENDAR:
       ?  /* full feed */
       END:VCALENDAR

                                  Figure 2

   EXAMPLE 2

   This is an example of the subsequent request and response when no
   changes have occurred.

5.  Changes to the iCalendar specifications

   This specification updates [RFC5545] to add the value DELETED to the
   STATUS property.

5.1.  Redefined Status property

   Property name  STATUS

   Purpose  This property defines the overall status or confirmation for
      the calendar component.

   Value Type  TEXT

   Property Parameters  IANA and non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance  This property can be specified once in "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   Description  In a group-scheduled calendar component, the property is
      used by the "Organizer" to provide a confirmation of the event to
      the "Attendees".  For example in a "VEVENT" calendar component,
      the "Organizer" can indicate that a meeting is tentative,
      confirmed, or cancelled.  In a "VTODO" calendar component, the

Internet-Draft       Calendar subscription upgrades        February 2021


      "Organizer" can indicate that an action item needs action, is
      completed, is in process or being worked on, or has been
      cancelled.  In a "VJOURNAL" calendar component, the "Organizer"
      can indicate that a journal entry is draft, final, or has been
      cancelled or removed.

   Format Definition

   This property is defined by the following notation:

   status          = "STATUS" statparam ":" statvalue CRLF

   statparam       = *(";" other-param)

   statvalue       = (statvalue-event
                   /  statvalue-todo
                   /  statvalue-jour)

   statvalue-event = "TENTATIVE"    ;Indicates event is tentative.
                   / "CONFIRMED"    ;Indicates event is definite.
                   / "CANCELLED"    ;Indicates event was cancelled.
                   / "DELETED"      ;Indicates event was deleted.
   ;Status values for a "VEVENT"

   statvalue-todo  = "NEEDS-ACTION" ;Indicates to-do needs action.
                   / "COMPLETED"    ;Indicates to-do completed.
                   / "IN-PROCESS"   ;Indicates to-do in process of.
                   / "CANCELLED"    ;Indicates to-do was cancelled.
                   / "DELETED"      ;Indicates to-do was deleted.
   ;Status values for "VTODO".

   statvalue-jour  = "DRAFT"        ;Indicates journal is draft.
                   / "FINAL"        ;Indicates journal is final.
                   / "CANCELLED"    ;Indicates journal is removed.
                   / "DELETED"      ;Indicates journal was deleted.
   ;Status values for "VJOURNAL".

   EXAMPLE 2

   The following is an example of this property for a "VTODO" calendar
   component:

   STATUS:NEEDS-ACTION

   calendar component:

   STATUS:DRAFT

                                  Figure 9

6.  Header Field: Sync-Token

   This specification defines a new header field Sync-Token for use by
   the enhanced GET method.

       Accept = DQUOTE URI DQUOTE

                                 Figure 10

   The value MUST be a URI.  This will generally be a data URI
   representing an opaque token.  Client MUST not attempt to interpret
   the data URI value.

   EXAMPLE

   This is an example of the Sync-Token header field:

       Sync-Token: "data:,1234567"

                                 Figure 11

7.  New Prefer header field preferences

7.1.  Preference subscribe-enhanced-get

   This indicates that the client expects the server to handle the GET
   method according to the specifications for enhanced get.

       pref-subscribe-enhanced-get = "subscribe-enhanced-get"

                                 Figure 12

7.2.  Preference limit

   This preference parameter provides a limit on the number of
   components returned for enhanced get.

       pref-limit = "limit" BWS "=" BWS 1*DIGIT

                                 Figure 13

8.  Link relations

8.1.  General

   This clause defines a number of new link relations required to
   facilitate subscription upgrades.

8.2.  subscribe-caldav

   This specifies an access point which is a full implementation of
   caldav but requires no authentication.  The end point allows the full
   range of reports as defined by the CalDAV specification.

   The client MUST follow the specification to determine exactly what
   operations are allowed on the access point - for example to determine
   if sync-report is supported.

   The URL MAY include some form of token to allow write access to the
   targeted collection.  The client must check it's permissions to
   determine whether or not it has been granted write access.

8.3.  subscribe-caldav-auth

   This specifies an access point which is a full implementation of
   caldav and requires authentication.  This may allow read-write access
   to the resource.

   The client MUST follow the specification to determine exactly what
   operations are allowed on the access point - for example to determine
   if sync-report is supported.

8.4.  subscribe-webdav-sync

   This specifies an access point which supports only webdav sync.

Internet-Draft       Calendar subscription upgrades        February 2021


   This allows the client to issue a sync-report on the resource to
   obtain updates.

   The client MUST follow that specification.

8.5.  subscribe-enhanced-get

   This specifies an access point which supports something new.

   The client MUST follow that specification.

9.  Security Considerations

   Applications using these properties need to be aware of the risks
   entailed in using the URIs provided as values.  See [RFC3986] for a
   discussion of the security considerations relating to URIs. ==
   Privacy Considerations

   Properties with a "URI" value type can expose their users to privacy
   leaks as any network access of the URI data can be tracked.  Clients
   SHOULD NOT automatically download data referenced by the URI without
   explicit instruction from users.  This specification does not
   introduce any additional privacy concerns beyond those described in
   [RFC5545].

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  Sync-Token HTTP Header Field Registration

   This specification updates the "Message Headers" registry entry for
   "Sync-Token" in [RFC3864] to refer to this document.

   Header Field Name: Sync-Token
   Protocol: http
   Status: standard
   Reference: <this-document>

                                 Figure 14

10.2.  Preference Registrations

   The following preferences have been added to the HTTP Preferences
   Registry defined in [RFC7240]

   Preference  subscribe-enhanced-get

   Value  None.
