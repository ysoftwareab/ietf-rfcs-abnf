Internet-Draft          Dynamic Feedback Protocol            August 2005


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Problem Description

   The Dynamic Feedback Protocol, DFP, is designed to be used in Server
   Load-Balancing (SLB) environments.  In the SLB environment, it is
   critical to know the availability of the servers in your server farm.
   The problem today is that there is no effective way for the real
   server to relay their overall health back to the SLB device.

   There are several ways to monitor the health of real servers.  You
   can actively monitor the flows that are being served by the SLB
   device.  You can also activate probes on the SLB device.  In this
   context, a probe is a program that acts as a client to the server
   farm.  It will query for data, and it will compare the received data
   to that of the probes configuration for acceptable data values coming
   back.  While these methods are somewhat effective in understanding if
   the real servers are available or not, they do not offer a view into
   the true health of the real servers.

   The DFP protocol will allow the real servers to adjust their overall
   health to the SLB device.  This will play a role into which real
   server is picked by the SLB device to service a particular flow.  The
   most available and most healthy real server will be chosen to handle
   the 'next' flow.

1.2.  Overview

   Editor's note: Need to add

1.3.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

   Virtual server: a virtual instance of a set of real servers that
   clients use to connect to a site.  The virtual server is represented
   by an IP address, port, and protocol.

   Server farm: a set of servers that are pre-defined to do the work for
   a virtual server.

   Real server: the physical server in a datacenter that is running the
   application to fullfill the requests of incoming clients.

   Server Load Balancer, SLB: Device in the network that distributes
   load to a server farm via a virtual server.

   Server agent: software running on the real server that collects

   statistics about the real server.  These statistics are then reported
   to a SLB device or a third-party box for determining the overall
   health or availability of the real server.  This will also be
   referred to as a DFP agent.

   DFP manager: the network entity that the Server agent will report the
   availability of a real server to in a particular operating
   environment.  This could be the SLB device directly, or it could be a
   third party entity.

2.  Design Considerations

2.1.  Environment Independence

   This protocol is designed to be used within any network
   infrastructure.  It is the responsibility of the DFP agent to gather
   the statistical data from the actual server and to translate that
   into meaningful data to report to the DFP manager.  Having this
   seperation allows the DFP agent to interpret the information
   differently depending on its actual operating environment.

2.2.  Extensibility

   The type of information being reported will grow as more features are
   added to server farms.  Because of this, the protocol must provide
   both flexibility and extensibility.  New information can be added and
   reported using DFP without 'breaking' the participants that do not
   understand this new information.  This is achieved through the TLV
   values.

   As new features are created, more TLVs can be added to messages
   without disturbing the current participants.  This allows for a form
   of backwards compatibility in a particular operating environment
   without adding a lot of complexity.

2.3.  Security

   This protocol allows real servers to provide feedback on their
   availability in addition to allowing them to take themselves in and
   out of service for a particular server farm.  This implies that a
   security risk exists if the network is 'hacked', which could take a
   virtual server out of service.

   An optional Security TLV is included in the protocol to allow for
   message verification.  This allows different levels of security to
   the latest and greatest method that is being used without an overhaul
   or modification to the protocol.

   The security rules are easy.  If a receiving unit is configured for a
   security type, then all DFP messages must contain that security TLV
   or they will be ignored. if a receiving unit is not configured for
   any security type, the security TLV does not have to be present.  If
   the security TLV is present in this case, it is ignored while the
   rest of the message is processed normally.

3.  Architecture

3.1.  Functional Structure

   DFP is a protocol between DFP agents running on the real servers in a
   server farm and an outside entity.  That outside entity could be a
   SLB device or a third-party host.  If the data is collected by a
   third-party host, the assumption is for that host to normalize the
   data for all the servers in a server farm.  The third-party host
   would then report all the information to the SLB device.  The DFP
   agent is responsible for collecting server status by whatever means
   available.  It then reports that information to the DFP manager.

   In the case of a third party unit gathering the information, DFP will
   be the protocol used between all units in the network.  DFP will be
   running between the DFP agents and DFP mananger.  DFP will also be
   running between the DFP manager and the SLB device.  In this context,
   it is assumed that any information being reported to a third party
   unit will report the same information to the SLB device.  The only
   difference is that the third party unit can 'normalize' the data for
   all real servers in a server farm.  It should be noted that load-
   balancing decisions will not be affected until the information is
   received and processed by the SLB device.

   The communication between the DFP agent and the SLB/third-party unit
   is a long-lived, reliable connection (e.g., TCP).  The DFP manager is
   responsible for initiating and maintaining the connection.  Based
   upon the messages being received by the SLB device, the SLB device is
   responsible for updating its internal status of the real servers.

   The implemenation of the DFP agent is outside the scope of DFP.  The
   agent software can gather whatever information it wants to about the
   health of the real server.  The only part that is important to DFP is
   how the information is sent from the real server.  DFP is the
   protocol that defines how the data is sent.

   At this time, there is no dynamic discovery method implemented as a
   part of the DFP protocol.  The units must be configured with real and
   virtual server information.  Additionally, the SLB device must be
   configured with DFP agent information so it can initiate the
   connection for retreiving information.  [Editors note: here is where
   we need to plug in RSERPOOL to provide the dynamic discovery :-D]

3.2.  System Flow

4.  Message Structure

   DFP messages will contain a Signal Header describing the DFP protocol
   version and the defined message type.  In order to make the protocol
   extensible, defined messages will be broken up into Type, Length,
   Value, (TLV) format.  Each message will contain the type of message
   followed by the length of that component.  Lastly the actual value
   will be included.  This will allow for new message types to be added
   in the future without disturbing the current protocol definition.  If
   a message type is not understood by the receiver, the entire message
   should be discarded.

   All messages are assumed to be in Network Byte Order throughout the
   protocol.

4.1.  Message Format

   The message format will be:

                   +-----------------------+
                   |     Signal Header     |
                   +-----------------------+
                   |      First TLV        |
                   +-----------------------+
                   |     Second TLV        |
                   +-----------------------+
                   |         .....         |
                   +-----------------------+
                   |      Last TLV         |
                   +-----------------------+

   The signal header is used to specify the DFP version number and
   message type.  The DFP version number is intended to be used for
   compatibility in the network.  The overall length of the entire DFP
   message is also included.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |Version = 0x01 |0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|          Message Type         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                       Message Length                          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Message Length is the entire length of the message, including the
   signal header.

   The TLV header is the first part of each component in the DFP
   message.  It describes the type and the overall length of the TLV.
   This allows the receiver of the message to interpret the contents
   correctly.  It also allows the receiver the ability to skip over any
   TLVs that are not understood.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |             Type              |            Length             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Length is the length of the TLV data plus the TLV header.

5.  Defined TLV

   The following TLVs are defined.  TLVs are used to relay necessary
   data based on the message type.  Defined messages are listed later.

                   +-------------------------------------+
                   |   TLV Name          | Type Value    |
                   +-------------------------------------+
                   | Security            | 0x0001        |
                   +-------------------------------------+
                   | Load                | 0x0002        |
                   +-------------------------------------+
                   | Keep-Alive          | 0x0101        |

                   +-------------------------------------+
                   | BindID Table        | 0x0301        |
                   +-------------------------------------+

   The "Reserved" TLVs are intended for future expansion or for user-
   defined values.  A user can define and use TLVs of their choosing.

5.1.  Security

   The security TLV is used to describe the security algorithm being
   used.  Additionally, it provides the data necessary for that security
   algorithm.  This TLV is optional in the protocol.  If the TLV is not
   present, then security is disabled.  If this TLV is present, then it
   must be immediately after the Signal Header.  The definition:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   The defined Security values are:

5.1.1.  MD5 Security Authentication

   The MD5 Security Authentication contains the following data:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   MD5 Key ID, 4-bytes: used to determine which key (i.e., password) was
   used in the MD5 calculation.  This allows the changing of the keys on
   the various boxes (i.e., DFP Agents, SLB devices, etc) without
   messages being rejected.

   MD5 Authentication Data, 16-bytes: contains a 128-bit hash of the
   message.  This hash is based on the sum of the shared key plus the
   entire message beginning with the Signal Header plus the shared key
   again.  This follows RFC1828 [1] MD5 to include the key in producing
   the 128-bit message digest.

   The MD5 hash is calculated per RFC1828 [1] over the entire DFP
   portion of the message beginning with the signal header.  The
   Authentication Data and Key ID fields are set to NULL (i.e. zeros)
   when calculating this hash value.

   MD5 keys will consist of up to 64 ASCII characters If the key is less
   than 64 characters, it will be padded as per RFC1828 [1].  If
   multiple keys are used, each key will have a "Key ID" assigned to it
   upon configuration.  This "Key ID" is provided with the message to
   allow the receiving unit to be informed as to which key should be
   used to verify this message.  The "Key ID" for each key must be

   unique and must be configured identically on all boxes.  This value
   is any 4-byte number.  The default value for a single key should be
   zero.  When configuring MD5 keys, an optional time-out value can be
   supplied.

   The timeout value is used for two reasons:

   1.  When a new key is added, no system will send a message using this
   new key for time-out number of seconds.  All systems will accept
   messages using this key immediately.  If this is the first key, the
   system should begin using it immediately as unit that are not yet
   configured for security will ignore the security TLV.  The system
   should also accept messages that do not contain the security TLV for
   this time-out period.  This gives the system Administrator time-out
   seconds to configure the key on all systems involved without having a
   disruption in service.

   2.  When it becomes desirable to remove or replace a password, the
   time-out value is used to tell each system to stop sending messages
   with a key immediately.  All systems should also stop accepting
   messages using that key after time-out seconds.  If the key is being
   replaced, the old key must be accepted for time-out seconds.  Again,
   this will give the system Administrator time-out seconds to remove or
   replace this key for each system.

5.2.  Load

   The Load TLV contains the actual load information being reported via
   the DFP agents on the servers.  The real servers are first grouped by
   their port number and protocol type requiring a seperate Load TLV for
   each grouping.  The individual servers are then listed with their
   individual weights.  The BindID is included in the definition of the
   server to allow a single server to be bound to multiple virtual
   servers.  By having a distinct BindID, the server can report a
   different weight for each virtual server.

   Port Number, 2-bytes: port number of host server.  This can be
   represented as a wildcard value, 0x0000.

   Protocol, 1-byte: protocol of the host server.  This can be
   represented as a wildcard value, 0x00.

   Flags, 1-byte: miscellaneous flags - currently set to zero.

   Number of Hosts, 2-bytes: total number of host servers included in
   this reporting of weights.

   Reserved, 2-bytes: set to zero.

   Preference Field, 8-bytes: One for each host being reported, which
   includes: IP address (4-bytes), BindID (2-bytes), and Weight
   (2-bytes).

5.2.1.  Weight Value

   The weight value in the Load TLV is used by the SLB device to
   determine which server is most available to service the next flow.
   In the most simplistic terms, the higher the weight value the more
   available the server.  The weight of zero means that the server is
   not available for any more flows.

   The way the weight value is exactly used depends on the load
   distribution algorithim that the SLB device is using.  The most
   common load distribution algorithims that use a weight value are
   weighted least connections and weighted round robin.

   The weighted least connections algorithm distributes the next flow to
   the server that has the fewest number of flows.  It will use the
   weight value as a way to have the overall load distributed for a
   particular virtual server.  For example, if there are 3 servers with
   weights of 1, 1, and 2, then the servers with a weight of 1 would
   have 25% each of the total flows for the virtual server, and the
   server with a weight of 2 would have 50% of the total flows for the
   same virtual server.

   The weighted round robin algorithm distributes the next flow based on
   which server got the previous flow and the weights.  The servers for
   a virtual server will get 'weight value' number of flows in a row,
   then the next server will get its 'weight value' number of flows in a
   row.  This will repeat until the last server gets its flows, then it
   will go back to the top of the list.

5.3.  Keep-alive

   The Keep-alive TLV is part of the configuration for the connection
   maintained between the SLB device and the DFP agent running on the
   server.  This TLV has the configuration to allow the SLB device to
   inform the DFP agent about the minimum time interval in which the DFP
   agent must send information over the DFP control connection.

   If the SLB device does not receive an update from the DFP agent in
   the minimimum amount of time configured, the SLB device will close
   the connection.  Once the connection is closed, the SLB device will
   attempt to establish a new control connection to the DFP agent.

      |                         Keep-alive Time                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Keep-alive time: time in seconds for which activity over the DFP
   control connection must be detected or the connection will be
   terminated.  A timeout value of zero means that the control
   connection will not be terminated due to no response from the DFP
   agent.

5.4.  BindID Table

   The BindID Table TLV is a mapping of BindID values to client network
   addresses for a particular server.  This TLV is a method by which
   these mappings can be provided by the DFP agent.  The SLB device may
   use the client IP address as part of its server selection process.
   Allowing the use of the client address in the server selection
   process for a flow allows for a mechanism in which Quality of Service
   can be implemented.

   The inclusion of a BindID, and thus a client's network, in the
   server's availability report allows a server to be more available for
   some client networks while simultaneously being less available for
   others.  As each server may have a different "representation" of the
   mapping between a client network and the BindID value, information
   about the server is included in this TLV.

6.1.  Preference Information Message

   The Preference Information message is sent from the DFP agent to the
   SLB device.  It is used to report the status (i.e., weight) for 0 to
   128 Servers.  If a DFP agent does not have any information to report,
   it must send this message with the Load TLV not included.  This is to
   act as an application level keep-alive.

6.2.  Server State Message

   The Server State message is sent from the SLB device to the DFP
   agent.  It is used to allow the SLB device to inform a DFP agent what
   it has decided independently from any status being reported to take a
   server out-of-service or to place a server back in-service.  The DFP
   agent may log this information, but it should not change its
   internally stored weight value for any server reported in this
   message.  Instead, the DFP agent should continue to report what it
   considers its availability of the server.  The status, weight value,
   of 0 to 128 servers may be included in this message.

                   +--------------------------+

6.3.  DFP Parmaters Message

   The DFP Parameters message is used to send configuration information
   about the DFP control connection from the SLB device to the DFP
   agent.  This information allows the DFP agent to know how to handle
   the DFP control connection.  Currently the only configuration
   information passed is the keep-alive interval.

                   +--------------------------+

6.4.  BindID Request Message

   The BindID Request message is used by the SLB device to request an
   updated version of the BindID database.  Upon receiving this message,
   the DFP agent should respond with BindID Report messages in which the
   BindID database is reported.  This message contains no data and
   therefore it contains no additional TLVs.

                   +--------------------------+

6.5.  BindID Report Message

   The BindID Report message is sent in response to a BindID Request
   message.  It is never sent autonomously.  This message contains a
   mapping of BindIDs to client networks, and it is used to report this
   information to the SLB device.  A seperate should be sent for each
   server's tables.  The DFP agent should send its entire table anytime
   the BindID table is requested.  When the entire table has been sent
   (or there is no table to send), this message should be sent with the
   BindID table TLV entries with a zero Server IP address, Server port,
   protocol, and number of entries.  This indicates there is no more
   data to be sent.

                   +--------------------------+

6.6.  BindID Change Notify Message

   The BindID Change Notify message is sued by a DFP agent to report
   that a change has been made to its BindID database.  This
   notification allows the DFP manager the option of requesting a new
   copy of the entire table.  This message contains no additional data
   and therefore does not contain any additional TLVs.
