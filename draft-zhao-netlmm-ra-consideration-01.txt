Abstract

   RA sent to inform MN about the network prefix and gateway existed.But 
   within a netlmm domain,MN should think that it's home network is kept
   unchanged when it is roaming and it's default gateway is unchanged is
   the best.But current the netlmm draft only can make the MN know the 
   home network prefix.It can't give a convience way to make the gateway
   keep unchanged when the MN is roaming within a netlmm domain.

1.  Introduction

   In IPv6 scenario, the RA messages are sent to inform MN about the 
   network prefix and related gateway.And after receiving a RA from a 
   new address, MN would insert that into the default gateway list with
   the compound with that prefix it advisted.
   Within a netlmm domain,MN didn't know anything about the change of 
   the network. Network side keep the MN believe it still always stay 
   in it's home network.
   For achieving this goal, we should always sent the same home prefix 
   to a MN within a netlmm domain. Meanwhile,we also need to keep the 
   default gateway is the same to that MN during this progress.
   But current the netlmm draft only can sent to MN the same home 
   network prefix.It can't give a convience way to make the gateway
   keep unchanged when the MN is roaming within a netlmm domain.
   For this reason,in this draft we provide a method to make MN didn't 
   feel the change of default gateway within a netlmm domain.


1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 RFC 2119
   [STANDARDS].

2.  Overview
 
   The source address of RA is the link-local address of the AR.When a 
   MN enter into a network,after it receive the RA messages,it will 
   extract the source address of RA and appended with the prefix in this 
   message to construct an address. When a Neighbour discovery progress 
   aimed to this address is proceeded and that address is certified to 
   be valid,the address will become the default address of this MN.Thus
   if a RA come from the new address,then that new address will be 
   inserted into the default gateway lists of the MN. And when the 
   previous one can't be used again, MN will use a implement method to 
   choose a candidate address to become the new default gateway. Of 
   course, if there is no one is existed,the MN will start a new 
   progress to discover the default gateway.
   For this reason,within a netlmm domain,we should keep the source
   address of the RA sent to MN didn't be changed after that MN has 
   entered into the network.
   As to the detail methods,we think the HA's link-local address is the
   best. Of course,the original link-local address should be kept as 
   the source address of RA next to send to the MN.For keep to use
   that link-local address,a context mechnism is needed,otherwise we 
   can use the AAA to forward it.

3.  The source address of RA

    In IPv6 context,the source address of RA is a link-local address of 
    AR.It's used to formed the candidated dateway by MN.After construct
    a global address,the default gateway selection algorithm is a 
    implementation method.

    Within a netlmm domain,we should keep the address unchanged in order
    to let MN believe it still stay in the original network.And that is 
    it's home network. Otherwise,will accuse the MN initial the new
    router discovery progress to choose a new AR as the default gateway.

    For keep this address the same as that is originally sent to MN.
    Following rule is taken into account:
   
    3.1 The original of this link-local address
    This link-local address can be the link-local address of the MN's HA
    .Or,it can be the same as the link-local address of that initial
    access router provided to MN when it enter into network initiallly. 

    3.2 Let the new access router know this address
    This link-local address can be learnt by new access router via the
    context transfer mechniasm or to download fram AAA.
    To the previous method,that is very easy to understand,but difficult
    to get the consistent agree to deploy the context tranfer mechnism.
    As to the last one,That can be deploied when the context transfer
    mechnism is unaviliable.

4.  IPv4 considerations
   
   In IPv4 scenario,the default gateway is got automatically via dhcp
   progress by MN if dynamic host configuration is applied.In that case,
   the whole address of the specified default gateway is transfered by 
   DHCP server to MN as the response to it's requirement.Then the MN will
   use this address as the default gateway and finish the arp detection.
   So we have two problem need to be consideration at here. One is to 
   keep the default gateway the same as the initial one when the MN 
   enter into that network.This can be done using the similiar method
   as those introduced in section 2.That original address is transfered
   or shared within a netlmm domain for the same MN.And another problem
   is that the MAC address also need to be kept the same as that the MN
   detect during it enter initially this network.That will depand which
   kind of link type is used by MN.If a IEEE802.3 MAC layer is used,then
   this is necessary,otherwise,maybe this can be omitted.
   Of course,the same problem is also applied to IPv6 scenario when the
   host configuration including the default gateway address is delivered
   via DHCP mechanism.

5.  Security Considerations

   All of the progresses and messages used at here is what currently 
   supported by MN.They all can use the current relevent security 
   method to guarantee their security.We didn't introduce and discuss 
   any new security mechnism to this draft.

6.  Conclusions

   The material used to let MN construct default gateway address and the
   default gateway address need to be kept unchanged within a netlmm 
   domain. Some identifier of the default gateway also need to be 
   considered to kept unchanged if necessary within a netlmm domain.
   All of above what we have discussed is aimed to a MN within a netlmm
   domain.Meanwhile the above is applied to P2P link mode.To shared 
   link mode, that will need to be appended in the future.
