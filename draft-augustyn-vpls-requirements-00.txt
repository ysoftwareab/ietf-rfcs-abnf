3  Definitions 

3.1 VPLS 
    
   A Virtual Private LAN Service or, when referring to a virtual LAN 
   segment offered by that service, a Virtual Private LAN Segment. 
    
   A VPLS service allows the connection of multiple sites in a single 
   bridged domain over a provider managed IP or MPLS network. All 
   customer sites in the VPLS appear to be on the same LAN regardless 
   of their location. 

3.2 VPLS System 
    
   A collection of communication equipment, related protocols, and 
   configuration elements that implements VPLS Services.

               draft-augustyn-vpls-requirements-00.txt   October 2001 
 
3.3 VPLS Domain 
    
   A Layer 2 VPN that is composed of a community of interest of L2 MAC 
   addresses and VLANs. Each VPLS Domain MAY have multiple VLANs in it. 

3.4 VLAN 
    
   A customer VLAN identification using some scheme such as IEEE 802.1Q 
   tags, port configuration or any other means. A VPLS service can be 
   extended to recognize customer VLANs as specified in 6.1 . 

3.5 VLAN Flooding Scope (VLAN Broadcast Domain) 
    
   The scope of flooding for a given VLAN.  
    
   In a VPLS service, a VLAN flooding scope MUST be identical to the 
   flooding scope of the VPLS it is part of. If a VPLS service is 
   extended to recognize customer VLANs, the VLAN flooding scope SHOULD 
   be limited to the broadcast domain of each recognized VLAN. 

3.6 VFI 
    
   Virtual Forwarding Instance.  
    
   A virtual layer 2 forwarding entity that is closed to a VPLS Domain 
   membership. VFI forwarding is based on MAC addresses, VLAN tags, 
   policies, topologies, filters, QoS parameters, and other relevant 
   information on a per VPLS basis. 

4  Introduction 
    
   Traditionally, the typical connectivity between a service provider 
   and a customer is a WAN link with some type of a point-to-point 
   protocol. This arrangement was borne out of the necessity to 
   traverse TDM circuits originally designed for voice traffic. The 
   introduction of WAN links to network architectures significantly 
   increased the complexity of network topologies and required highly 
   skilled personnel to manage and maintain the network. 
    
   One solution to the above has been for service providers to deploy 
   VPLS services (often known in this context as "Transparent LAN" 
   services, or TLS.) These have typically been offered over an ATM 
   infrastructure.  The TLS service is provisioned using a mesh of ATM 
   PVCs between locations.  While this reduces complexity for the 
   customer, the service provider must deal with managing and operating 
   the ATM network in addition to edge Ethernet switches.  This model 
   does not scale well and is expensive to maintain and manage for the 
   service provider. 
    
   The aim of this effort is to develop a VPLS service that is simpler 
   to manage and more scalable.  By using the service provider's 
  
Augustyn, et al.          Expires April 2002                         3 
 
               draft-augustyn-vpls-requirements-00.txt   October 2001 
 
   existing MPLS or IP backbone the overhead of running separate 
   network backbones can be avoided, while by using an MPLS label stack 
   or by tunneling traffic in IP the complexity (and scaling problems) 
   of building a separate mesh of VCs for each TLS can be avoided. 
       
   VPLS can be contrasted with two other service models.  One is the 
   Virtual Private Routed Network (VPRN) [4], in which the service 
   provider participates in the customer's routing protocol.  The 
   second model is a set of point-to-point circuits (L2VPN) [5]. 
      
   In the VPRN model the PE devices are required to maintain the 
   private IP routing tables of the customers.  These routing tables 
   may consist of hundreds, or thousands, or routes each.  Requiring 
   each PE device to hold all routes for each VPN present at that PE 
   has a major impact on the cost of these devices and the scalability 
   of the service.  Furthermore, PE devices are required to support 
   different routing protocols such as BGP, OSPF and RIP in order to 
   learn routing updates from the CE.  These PE devices will have to 
   maintain a separate routing instance per VPRN.  This support 
   increases the complexity of the service, and also impacts the cost 
   of the PE devices. 
    
   In contrast, in a given LAN segment there is a reasonably small set 
   of MAC devices with a limited number of MAC addresses to learn and 
   manage. Layer 2 VPN services do not require any additional routing 
   protocol support between the CE and the PE devices, and in fact they 
   are transparent to the customer's choice of routing protocol.  Layer 
   2 VPN services also benefit from being transparent to higher layer 
   protocols, so the same technology can transport, for example, IPv4, 
   IPv6, MPLS and also legacy protocols such as IPX and OSI. 
    
   In the L2VPN model the CE devices are required to support a number 
   of virtual circuits to other CE devices, and to form routing 
   adjacencies over these virtual circuits. In addition, when building 
   a large L2VPN, it becomes impractical to maintain a full mesh of 
   virtual circuits, and the provisioned topology has to be designed 
   per L2VPN.  In contrast VPLS emulates a flat LAN segment and has 
   learning and switching capabilities, and thus only requires the CE 
   to support a single connection to the VPLS.  Routing adjacencies can 
   be formed with a designated router for the VPLS, or in a full mesh 
   of all the CE devices on the VPLS (depending on the routing protocol 
   used by the customer.) 
    
   The VPLS model, while offering significant benefits for both 
   customers and service providers, retains all the quintessential 
   characteristics of L2 networks including their well known 
   limitations such as the maximum practical number of hosts on a 
   single segment and the inability to assign different metrics for 
   connectivity between different hosts on the same segment. The most 
   likely application of this model is to connect a few, or a few tens 
   of, sites over a metropolitan or regional reach and with only a 
   single customer router, or a few customer hosts, connected to the 
   VPLS at each site.

   The scope of this document will be limited to supporting Ethernet as 
   the access framing technology for VPLS implementation. 
    

5  VPLS Reference Model 
    
   The following diagram shows a VPLS reference model where PE devices 
   that are VPLS-capable provide a logical interconnect such that CE 
   devices belonging to a specific VPLS appear to be connected by a 
   single logical Ethernet bridge. A VPLS can contain a single VLAN or 
   multiple, tagged VLANs.

   Separate L2 broadcast domains are maintained on a per VPLS basis by 
   PE devices. Such domains are then mapped onto tunnels in the service 
   provider network. These tunnels can either be specific to a VPLS 
   instance (e.g. as with IP) or shared among several VPLS instances 
   (e.g. as with MPLS tunnel LSPs). In the above diagram, the top PE 
   routers maintain separate forwarding instances for VPLS A and VPLS 
   B. 
    
   The CE-to-PE links can either be direct physical links, e.g. 
   100BaseTX, or logical links, e.g. ATM PVC or T1/E1 TDM, over which 
   Ethernet payloads are carried. 
    
   The PE-to-PE links carry tunneled Ethernet frames using different 
   tunneling technologies (e.g., GRE, IPSec, MPLS.).

   Each PE device learns remote MAC addresses, and is responsible for 
   proper forwarding of the customer traffic to the appropriate end 
   nodes. It is responsible for guaranteeing each VPLS topology is loop 
   free. 
    

6  VPLS General Requirements 

6.1 Layer 2 Domain representation and VLAN allocation 
    
   A VPLS system MUST distinguish different customer domains. Each of 
   these customer domains MUST appear as a L2 broadcast domain network 
   behaving like a LAN (Local Area Network). These domains are referred 
   to as VPLS domains.  
    
   A VPLS Domain MAY span multiple service providers. Each VPLS domain 
   MUST carry a unique identification within a VPLS system. It is 
   RECOMMENDED that VPLS identification be globally unique. 
    
   Each VPLS Domain MUST be capable of learning and forwarding based on 
   MAC addresses thus emulating an Ethernet virtual switch to the 
   customer CE devices attached to PEs. 
    
   A VPLS system MAY recognize customer VLAN identification. In that 
   case, a VLAN MUST be recognized in the context of the VPLS it is 
   part of.  If customer VLANs are recognized, separate VLAN broadcast 
   domains SHOULD be maintained. 
    
   A provider's implementation of a VPLS system MUST not constrain the 
   customer's ability to configure VLAN topologies, tags, 802.1 p-bits, 
   or any other Layer 2 parameters. 
    

6.2 VPLS Topology 
    
   The VPLS system MAY be realized using one or more network tunnel 
   topologies to interconnect PEs, ranging  from simple point-to-point 
   to distributed hierarchical arrangements. The typical topologies 
   include: 
    
     o point-to-point 
     o point-to-multipoint, a.k.a. hub and spoke 
     o any-to-any, a.k.a. full mesh 
     o mixed, a.k.a. partial mesh 
     o hierarchical 
    
   Regardless of the topology employed, the service to the customers 
   MUST retain the typical LAN any-to-any connectivity.  This 
   requirement does not imply that all traffic characteristics (such as 
   bandwidth, QoS, delay, etc.) be necessarily the same between any two 
   end points.

               draft-augustyn-vpls-requirements-00.txt   October 2001 
 
6.3 Redundancy and Failure Recovery 
        
   The VPLS infrastructure SHOULD provide redundant paths to assure 
   high availability.  The reaction to failures SHOULD result in an 
   attempt to restore the service using alternative paths.   
    
   The intention is to keep the restoration time small. It is 
   RECOMMENDED that the restoration time be less than the failure 
   detection time of L3 service running over the same VLAN. 
    
   In cases where the provider knows a priori about impending changes 
   in network topology, the network SHOULD have the capability to 
   reconfigure without a loss, duplication, or re-ordering of customer 
   packets.  This situation typically arises with planned network 
   upgrades, or scheduled maintenance activities. 

6.4 Policy Constraints 
    
   A VPLS system MAY employ policy constraints governing various 
   interconnection attributes for VPLS domains. Typical attributes 
   include: 
    
     o Selection of available network infrastructure 
     o QoS services needed 
     o Protection services needed 
     o Availability of higher level service access points (see 9.11 ) 
         
   Policy attributes SHOULD be advertised via the VPLS system's control 
   plane. 
    

6.5 PE nodes 
    
   The PE nodes are the devices in the VPLS system that store 
   information related to customer VPLS domains and employ methods to 
   forward customer traffic based on that information. 
    
   All forwarding decisions related to customer VPLS traffic MUST be 
   made by PE nodes.  This requirement prohibits any other network 
   components from altering decisions made by PE nodes. 
    

6.6 PE-PE Interconnection and Tunneling 
    
   A VPLS system MUST employ either direct or a virtual connectivity 
   between PE nodes.  The connectivity is referred to as transport 
   tunneling or simply tunneling. 
    
   There are several choices for implementing transport tunnels. Some 
   popular choices include MPLS, IP in IP tunnels, variations of 
   802.1Q, etc.  Regardless of the choice, the existence of the tunnels 
   and their operations MUST be transparent to the customers.

6.7 PE-CE Interconnection and Profiles 
    
   A VPLS system MUST employ either direct or virtual connectivity 
   between PE nodes and CE nodes.  That connectivity is referred to as 
   CE access connection, access connection, or simply access. Access 
   connections MAY span networks of other providers or public networks. 
    
   There are several choices for implementing access. Some popular 
   choices include Ethernet, ATM (DSL), Frame Relay, MPLS-based virtual 
   circuits etc.  Regardless of the choice, the access connection MUST 
   use Ethernet frames as the Service Protocol Data Unit (SPDU). 
    
   A CE access connection MUST be bi-directional in nature. 
    
   PE devices MAY support multiple CE access connections on a single 
   physical interface. In such cases, PE devices MUST NOT rely on 
   customer controlled parameters, such as VLAN tags etc., for 
   distinguishing between different access connections. 
    
   A CE access connection, whether direct or virtual, MUST maintain all 
   committed characteristics of the customer traffic, such as QoS, 
   priorities etc. 
    
   The characteristics of a CE access connection are only applicable to 
   that connection.  

7  Control Plane Requirements 

7.1 Provider Edge Signaling 
    
   The control protocols SHOULD provide methods for signaling between 
   PEs connecting member CEs of a VPLS.  The signaling SHOULD inform of 
   membership, tunneling information, and other relevant parameters. 
    
   The infrastructure MAY employ manual configuration methods to 
   provide this type of information. 
    
   The infrastructure SHOULD use policies to scope the membership and 
   reachability advertisements for a particular VPLS. 

7.2 VPLS Membership Discovery 
    
   The control protocols SHOULD provide methods to discover the PEs 
   which connect CEs that form a VPLS. 
         

7.3 Support for Layer 2 control protocols 
    
   Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a widely used Layer 2 protocol to 
   prevent loops.  A VPLS SHOULD NOT use STP on the PE network. 
   However, it may be employed by the customer on a VPLS segment.  As 
  
Augustyn, et al.          Expires April 2002                         8 
 
               draft-augustyn-vpls-requirements-00.txt   October 2001 
 
   long as STP BPDUs are passed over the VPLS unaltered, the VPLS can 
   operate correctly.  A VPLS system's control protocols MAY use 
   indications from customer STP to improve the operation of a VPLS. 

7.4 Scaling Requirements 
    
   Control plane traffic will increase correspondingly, as a VPLS 
   scales in membership.  The rate of growth of control plane traffic 
   SHOULD be linear. 
    
   Control plane traffic will increase correspondingly, as the number 
   of supported VPLS segments increases.  The rate of growth of control 
   plane traffic SHOULD be linear. 

8  Data Plane Requirements 

8.1 Transparency 
    
   VPLS service is intended to be transparent to Layer 2 customer 
   networks.  It MUST NOT require any special packet processing by the 
   end users before sending packets to the provider's network. 

8.2 Broadcast Domain 
    
   The Broadcast Domain is defined as the flooding scope of a Layer 2 
   network. In a VPLS system, a separate Broadcast Domain MUST be 
   maintained for each VPLS.  
    
   In addition to VPLS Broadcast Domains, a VPLS system MAY recognize 
   customer VLAN Broadcast Domains. In that case, the system SHOULD 
   maintain a separate VLAN Broadcast Domain for each customer VLAN.  A 
   VLAN Broadcast Domain MUST be a subset of the owning VPLS Broadcast 
   Domain. 

8.3 Layer 2 Virtual Forwarding Instance 
    
   VPLS Provider Edge devices MUST maintain a separate Virtual 
   Forwarding Instance (VFI) per VPLS. Each VFI MUST have capabilities 
   to forward traffic based on customer's traffic parameters such as 
   MAC addresses, VLAN tags (if supported), etc. as well as local 
   policies. 
    
   Each VFI MUST have flooding capabilities for its Broadcast Domain to 
   facilitate proper forwarding of Broadcast, Multicast and Unknown 
   Unicast customer traffic. 
    
   VPLS Provider Edge devices MUST have capabilities to classify 
   incoming customer traffic into the appropriate VFI. 

8.4 MAC address learning

   A VPLS service SHOULD derive all topology and forwarding information 
   from packets originating at customer sites.  The service MAY 
   implement a MAC addresses learning mechanism for this purpose. 
    
   In a VPLS system, MAC address learning MUST take place on a per 
   Virtual Forwarding Instance (VFI) basis, i.e. in the context of a 
   VPLS and, if supported, in the context of VLANs therein. 
    

8.5 Unicast, Unknown Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast forwarding 
    
   VPLS MUST be aware of the existence and the designated roles of 
   special MAC addresses such as Multicast and Broadcast addresses. 
   VPLS MUST forward these packets according to their intended 
   functional meaning and scope. 
    
   Broadcast packets MUST be flooded to all destinations. 
    
   Multicast packets MUST be flooded to all destinations. However, a 
   VPLS system MAY employ multicast snooping techniques, in which case 
   multicast packets SHOULD be forwarded only to their intended 
   destinations. 
    
   Unicast packets MUST be forwarded to their intended destinations. 
    
   Unknown Unicast packets MUST be flooded to all destinations in the 
   flooding scope of the VPLS (or VLAN). If the VPLS service relies on 
   MAC learning for its operations, it MUST assure proper forwarding of 
   packets with MAC addresses that have not been learned.  Once 
   destination MAC addresses are learned, unicast packets SHOULD be 
   forwarded only to their intended destinations. 
    
   A provider MAY employ a method to limit the scope of flooding of 
   Unknown Unicast packets in cases where a customer desires to 
   conserve its bandwidth or wants to implement certain security 
   policies. 

8.6 Multilink Access 
    
   The VPLS service SHOULD support multilink access for CE devices. 
   The VPLS service MAY support multihome access for CE devices. 

8.7 Minimum MTU 
    
   The service MUST support customer frames with payload 1500 bytes 
   long.  The service MAY offer support for longer frames. 
    
   The service MUST NOT fragment packets.  Packets exceeding committed 
   MTU size MUST be discarded. 
    
   The committed minimum MTU size MUST be the same for a given VPLS. If 
   VLANs are supported, all VLANs within a given VPLS MUST inherit the

              draft-augustyn-vpls-requirements-00.txt   October 2001 
 
   same MTU size.  Different VPLS segments MAY have different committed 
   MTU sizes. 

8.8 Packet re-ordering or duplication 
    
   The service MUST preserve the order of packet sent from one end 
   point to another end point within given VPLS. If VLANs are 
   supported, the service MUST preserve the order of packets within 
   each recognized VLAN. 
    
   The service MUST NOT duplicate packets. 

8.9 QoS and Queuing 
    
   A VPLS system SHOULD have capabilities to enforce QoS parameters. 
   Queuing and Forwarding policies MUST NOT lead to packet misordering. 

8.10 Support for MAC Services 
    
   VPLS are REQUIRED to provide MAC service compliant with IEEE 802.1D 
   specification [6] Section 6. Compliance with this section 
   facilitates proper operation of 802.1 LAN and seamless integration 
   of VPLS with bridged Local Area Networks. 
    
   A MAC service in the context of VPLS is defined as the transfer of 
   user data between source and destination end stations via the 
   service access points using the information specified in the VFI. 
    
   1. A PE device that provides VPLS MUST NOT be directly accessed by 
      end stations except for explicit management purposes. 
    
   2. All MAC addresses MUST be unique within a given broadcast domain. 
    
   3. The topology and configuration of the VPLS MUST NOT restrict the 
      MAC addresses of end stations 
    

9  Management and Operations Requirements 
    

9.1 The VPLS system MUST have capabilities to manage and monitor its 
    different components. 
    
    

9.2 VPLS System Instantiation 
    
   It SHOULD be possible to create several disjoint instances of VPLS 
   systems within the same underlying network infrastructures.

               draft-augustyn-vpls-requirements-00.txt   October 2001 
 
9.3 Monitoring  
        
   The infrastructure SHOULD monitor all characteristics of the service 
   that are reflected in the customer SLA. This includes but is not 
   limited to bandwidth usage, packet counts, packet drops, service 
   outages, etc. 

9.4 VPLS membership 
    
   The amount of configuration changes when adding or deleting customer 
   ports to or from a given VPLS MUST be minimal. The configuration 
   changes of a port to or from a given VPLS SHOULD involve only 
   configuration on the device that this port is connected to. 

9.5 End-point VLAN tag translation 
    
   If VLANs are recognized, the infrastructure MAY support translation 
   of customers' VLAN tags. Such service simplifies connectivity of 
   sites that want to keep their tag assignments or sites that belong 
   to different administrative entities.  In the latter case, the 
   connectivity is sometimes referred to as L2 extranet. 

9.6 MAC Address Limiting 
    
   The VPLS infrastructure MUST be able to limit the number of MAC 
   addresses learned from the customers. 

9.7 CE Provisioning 
    
   The VPLS MUST require only minimal or no configuration on the CE 
   devices, depending on the CE device that connects into the 
   infrastructure. 

9.8 Customer traffic policing 
    
   The VPLS service SHOULD provide the ability to police and/or shape 
   customer traffic entering and leaving the VPLS system. 

9.9 Dynamic Service Signaling  
        
   A Provider MAY offer to Customers an in-band method for selecting 
   services from the list specified in the SLA. A Provider MAY use the 
   same mechanism for reporting statistical data related to the 
   service. 

9.10 Class of Service Model  
        
   The VPLS service MAY define a graded selection of classes of 
   traffic.  These include, but are not limited to 
        
     o range of priorities  
  
Augustyn, et al.          Expires April 2002                        12 
 
               draft-augustyn-vpls-requirements-00.txt   October 2001 
 
     o best effort vs. guaranteed effort  
     o range of minimum delay characteristics  

9.11 L3, and higher, service access point.  
        
   The VPLS service SHOULD allow for a Provider based Service Access 
   Point for orderly injection of L3 or higher services to the 
   customers' VPLS segments. 
        
   As a value added service, a Provider MAY offer access to other 
   services such as, IP gateways, storage networks, content delivery 
   etc.. 

9.12 Testing 
    
   The VPLS service SHOULD provide the ability to test and verify 
   operational and maintenance activities on a per VLAN basis. 
    

10 Security Requirements 

10.1 Traffic separation 
    
   VPLS system MUST provide traffic separation between different VPLS 
   domains as well as between customer VLANs within each VPLS domain if 
   VLANs are supported. 

10.2 Provider network protection. 
    
   The VPLS system MUST be immune to malformed or maliciously 
   constructed customer traffic. This includes but is not limited to 
   duplicate or invalid MAC addresses, short/long packets, spoofed 
   management packets, spoofed VLAN tags, high volume traffic, etc. 
    
   Additionally, VPLS system MUST be immune to misconfigured or 
   maliciously set up customer network topologies.  These include 
   customer side loops, backdoor links between sites, etc. 
    
   The VPLS infrastructure devices MUST NOT be accessible from the 
   VPLS. 

10.3 Value added security services 
    
   Value added security services such as encryption and/or 
   authentication of customer packets, certificate management, and 
   similar are OPTIONAL. 
    
   Security measures employed by the VPLS system SHOULD NOT restrict 
   implementation of customer based security add-ons.
