1. Introduction

   The publication of comments in reference to the standards is due to
   the following considerations:

      (1) The Armenian character sets have been used in different
      computer systems approx. since 1982, whereas the state standard
      was established only in 1997. This time lag resulted in emergence
      of incompatible coding systems. The existing discrepancies are
      also due to the existence of two different grammars of the
      Armenian language.

      (2) The emergence of internationalized operating systems and an
      important number of multi-lingual applications result in
      situations when the national language support is implemented by
      programmers that are not familiar with the given language.

   The present memo is a recommendation rather than a binding standard.

   The recommendations set forth herein are elaborated on the basis of
   the state standards AST 34.001 (reg.no. 166-97) and AST 34.002
   (reg.no.  167-97), as well as ArmSCII standard.


2. Basic Character Set

2.1. Naming

   The Basic Armenian character set presented below follows the standard
   AST 34.001. The first column contains full naming of the characters,
   and the second column provides abbreviations thereof that can be used
   in the systems confined to the Latin character set.  The detailed
   classification of the characters follows in the points below.

   In spite of the fact that the space, numbers and Latin letters are
   also part of the Armenian character set, these were not included in
   the AST 34.001 standard since these are present in all systems.

      End of Table 1.

   The naming of characters are hereinafter referred to in abbreviated
   forms contained in the second column.


2.2. Classification and Sorting

   unclassified-symbols ::= {armeternity, armew, armsection}

   punctuation-signs ::= {armfullstop, armparenright, armparenleft,
      armquotright, armquotleft, armemdash, armdot, armsep, armcomma,
      armendash}

   pseudo-letters ::= {armyentamna, armellipsis, armapostrophe}

   diacritic-signs ::= {armexclam, armaccent, armquestion}

   letters ::= {capital-letters, small-letters}

   capital-letters ::= {Armayb, Armben, Armgim, Armda, Armyech, Armza,
      Arme, Armat, Armto, Armzhe, Armini, Armlyun, Armkhe, Armtsa,
      Armken, Armho, Armdza, Armghat, Armtche, Armmen, Armhi, Armnu,
      Armsha, Armvo, Armcha, Armpe, Armje, Armra, Armse, Armvev,
      Armtyun, Armre, Armtso, Armvyun, Armpyur, Armke, Armo, Armfe}

   small-letters ::= {armayb, armben, armgim, armda, armyech, armza,
      arme, armat, armto, armzhe, armini, armlyun, armkhe, armtsa,
      armken, armho, armdza, armghat, armtche, armmen, armhi, armnu,
      armsha, armvo, armcha, armpe, armje, armra, armse, armvev,
      armtyun, armre, armtso, armvyun, armpyur, armke, armo, armfe}

   The sorting order is important for letter characters only and is made
   in the order presented in the Table 1.

   The case shift applies for letter characters only. The shift from the
   upper case to the lower case replaces the capital letter character
   with the subsequent character as per the Table 1.  Accordingly, the
   shift from lower case to the upper case replaces the small letter
   character with the preceding character as per the Table 1.

   The text search and dictionary applications should take into account
   the following factors: (1) in the Armenian language, a word is a
   sequence of letter characters, diacritic-signs, and pseudo-letters;
   (2) in comparison of words in the text or dictionary, the diacritic-
   signs and pseudo-letters may be ignored.

   In reference to the diacritic-signs, the following factors are

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 May 1998


   important:  (1) the diacritic-sign refers to the preceding letter
   (only vowel in Armenian), (2) a letter can be followed by more than
   one diacritic sign.


2.3. Ligatures

   Ligature is a traditional or convenience graphical presentation of a
   sequence of letters, e.g. the Latin ligature "ft", the German
   ligature "ss", the Armenian ligature "armmen, armnu", etc. The
   ligatures can be officially registered and codified (like in UNICODE
   standard), but the systems supporting ligatures substitute them
   automatically only on the screen, printer, or other graphical
   devices.

   The Armenian ligature armew that is a combination of armyech and
   armvyun was included in the AST 34.001 standard in view of the
   following considerations: (1) armew is a "ligature symbol" rather
   than a ligature, and (2) armew carries an "and" denotation similar to
   the "&" character.


3. Encoding

3.1. Basic Principles

   The Coded Character Set is a mapping of a set of characters into a
   set of integer numbers, e.g. ArmSCII-7, ArmSCII-8 and ArmSCII-8A
   tables.

   The term "unification" is used in the following denotation: as a
   rule, the mapping of an Armenian character set takes place in
   operating environments where other character sets are already
   available; thus, certain characters, in particular punctuation marks,
   may have identical graphical mapping and similar functions.  In such
   cases, some characters of the Armenian character set may be mapped
   into already existing codified characters. The details of unification
   of Armenian punctuation marks are reviewed below.

   The mapping of characters in coding tables has several aspects (in
   order of priority): (1) scope of the character mapping, (2) sequence
   of mapping, (3) character unification requirements, (4) general
   requirements of a given operating environment.

   The encoding in every new operating environment should, to the extent
   possible, use the already existing coding tables (see the next
   section).  Should this be impossible, the newly created coding tables
   should follow as much as possible the following general principles:



Melikyan                                                        [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 May 1998


      (1) The Armenian character set should be comprehensive (with due
      regard to the unification)

      (2) The Armenian character set should be mapped into a continual
      sequence of codes in the order these are presented in the Table 1.
      The unified character codes should be left absolute, i.e. should
      not be used for other purposes. The most important is the letter
      sequence.

      (3) The unification implies both graphical and functional identity
      of characters. For example, mapping of the parenthesis
      (armparenleft and armparenright) into the parenthesis existing in
      the ASCII is not an error.  On the other hand, the similarity of
      the Armenian full stop (armfullstop) and the colon is purely
      graphical. The armdot and armsep bear functions different from the
      Latin dot and the grave accent character accordingly.  Another
      important factor of character unification is the use of the Latin
      alphabet and punctuation marks in formal languages. It should be
      born in mind, for example, that a comma is often used as a
      separator in lists (e.g. in a keyword list in HTML document
      header), and in order to avoid confusion, the armcomma character
      may be mapped into a Latin comma.

      (4) It may often happen that the requirements of a given operating
      environment may contradict the above principles. For example, the
      pseudo-graphical characters in DOS that were supported by video-
      adapters ("ninth pixel" factor), resulted in the creation of an
      alternative 8-bit coding table ArmSCII-8A. Another example is
      Macintosh OS where codes like ellipsis, nbsp and soft hyphen are
      recognized and interpreted in a special by numerous applications,
      which rendered the meaningful use the ArmSCII standard in this
      system impossible (the ArmSCII-8A table is used in OS Macintosh).

   ArmSCII does not fully correspond to the above principles, and the
   Armenian block in the current version of UNICODE (2.1) corresponds to
   neither (1), (2), nor (3).

4. Character Set and Language Tags

4.1. Coded Character Set Tags

   In the systems and protocols using mnemonic tags for coded character
   sets, the following tags should be used (name, official source,
   optional alias):

      Name:    armscii-8
      Source:  Armenian State Standard AST 34.002 Basic 8-bit coded
               character set
      Alias:   AST_34.002

      Name:    armscii-8a
      Source:  Armenian State Standard AST 34.002 Alternative 8-bit
               coded character set
      Alias:   AST_34.002-A


4.2. Language Tags

   Dictionaries, spelling checkers and other linguistic systems, as well
   as operating environments distinguishing human languages and locale
   identification should take into consideration the existence of 4
   mutually incomprehensible forms (dialects) of the Armenian language:
   Eastern, Western, Grabar and Middle. Table 3 presents two forms of
   suggested mnemonic tags: MIME-style (RFC-1766) and Windows-style 3-
   letter abbreviations.

      Table 3. Language tags

      MIME-style name  3-letter code  Full name
      ---------------------------------------------------
      hy-eastern       AME            Armenian Eastern
      hy-western       AMW            Armenian Western
      hy-grabar        AMG            Armenian Grabar
      hy-middle        AMM            Armenian Middle
      ---------------------------------------------------
