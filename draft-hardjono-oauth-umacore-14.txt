             User-Managed Access (UMA) Profile of OAuth 2.0
                    draft-hardjono-oauth-umacore-14

Abstract

   User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  UMA defines how
   resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients
   operated by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources reside
   on any number of resource servers, and where a centralized
   authorization server governs access based on resource owner policies.

1.  Introduction

   User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2].  UMA
   defines how resource owners can control protected-resource access by
   clients operated by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources
   reside on any number of resource servers, and where a centralized
   authorization server governs access based on resource owner policies.
   Resource owners configure authorization servers with access policies
   that serve as asynchronous authorization grants.

   UMA serves numerous use cases where a resource owner uses a dedicated
   service to manage authorization for access to their resources,
   potentially even without the run-time presence of the resource owner.
   A typical example is the following: a web user (an end-user resource
   owner) can authorize a web or native app (a client) to gain one-time
   or ongoing access to a protected resource containing his home address
   stored at a "personal data store" service (a resource server), by
   telling the resource server to respect access entitlements issued by
   his chosen cloud-based authorization service (an authorization
   server).  The requesting party operating the client might be the
   resource owner, where the app is run by an e-commerce company that
   needs to know where to ship a purchased item, or the requesting party
   might be resource owner's friend who is using an online address book
   service to collect contact information, or the requesting party might
   be a survey company that uses an autonomous web service to compile
   population demographics.  A variety of use cases can be found in
   [UMA-usecases] and [UMA-casestudies].

   Please see for the full UMA-Core 1.0 Specification for a complete
   description of UMA Core.
