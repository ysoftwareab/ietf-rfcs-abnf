Abstract

   Advertising Digital Identification (Ad-ID) Identifiers are used
   identifying Advertising Assets across all media platforms (over the
   air, on-line, over the top, mobile, place based). This document
   defines the formal Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace Identifier
   (NID) for Ad-ID Identifiers.

1. Introduction

    This document defines the formal Uniform Resource Name (URN)
    Namespace Identifier (NID) for Ad-ID Identifiers.

    Ad-ID is the industry standard for identifying advertising assets
    across all media platforms. Ad-ID's data model includes the
    registration of advertising assets using standardized descriptive
    metadata about ads including advertiser, product, commercial title
    and other essential data. Ad-ID Identifiers are unique codes for
    each advertising asset digitally, and applies that code to all
    media.

    [Ad-ID-INTRO] provides additional background information.
	
2. Completed URN Namespace Definition Template

   The namespace definition according to the template in [RFC3406] is
   as follows:

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The identifier structure is as follows:

         An Ad-ID Identifier consists of a unique eleven character string
         or a unique twelve character string (video codes only).

      This string is divided into three parts:

         1. A four-character alphanumeric Company Prefix, not starting
            with "0".
         2. A seven-character alphanumeric code.
         3. An optional one-character Video Format Identifier.

			Video Format:
            H - High Definition
            D - Three-Dimensional

      The URN representation URN-ADID of an Ad-ID Identifier
      conforms to the syntax specified below using ABNF 
	  (as specified in IETF RFC 5234):

         URN-ADID = "urn:adid:" full_adid_identifier
         full_adid_identifier = adid_prefix adid_code [adid_suffix]
         adid_prefix = (ALPHA / %x31-39) 3*alphanum
            ; first character not zero
         adid_code = 7*alphanum
         adid_suffix = "H" / "D"
         alphanum = ALPHA / DIGIT

      Examples:

         Standard Definition (SD): urn:adid:ABCD0001000
         High Definition (HD):     urn:adid:ABCD0001000H
		 Three-dimensional (3D):   urn:adid:ABCD00010003

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      [SMPTERP2092-1] specifies Advertising Digital Identifier (Ad-ID)
      Representations.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      The Registrar (Advertising Digital Identification, LLC) is
      responsible for managing the assignment of the Ad-ID Identifier and
      shall ensure the uniqueness by checking the identifier against the
      list of existing ids.

      Ad-ID assigns the identifier, adid, in such a way that the
      uniqueness of the 'adid' will be maintained.  Furthermore, an Ad-
      ID Identifier is associated with a single URN-ADID.

  Identifier persistence considerations:

      The assignment process guarantees that 'adids' are not reassigned
      or reused and the binding between the id and its resource is
      permanent.

   primary benefits of its use are greater transparency and
   accountability in the advertising marketplace, help eliminate costly
   errors associated with the inconsistent use of advertising asset
   identifiers throughout the advertising supply chain, and enable more
   granular audience measurement across multiple platforms.

4. Security Considerations

   This document specifies the syntax of the Ad-ID-URN namespace and
   makes no security representations.  Note however that failure to
   conform to the syntactic and lexical equivalence rules specified when
   using an Ad-ID Identifier as a criterion for accessing restricted
   resources can result in granting unauthorized access.

5. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a URN NID registration that is to be entered
   into the IANA registry of URN NIDs.  It specifically requests the
   Ad-ID NID.

6.2. Informative References


   [Ad-ID-INTRO]
   Ad-ID Identifiers are 11 characters except for High Definition (HD)
   or Three-Dimensional (3D) codes, which have an H or D in the 12th
   character.

   Ad-ID may have Complimentary Definition Codes (CDC's), which are
   matching SD, HD and/or 3D codes where only the 12th character of the
   code varies. This only applies to Video codes.
