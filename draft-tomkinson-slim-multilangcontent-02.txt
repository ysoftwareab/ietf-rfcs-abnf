                draft-tomkinson-slim-multilangcontent-02

Abstract

   This document defines an addition to the Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions (MIME) standard to make it possible to send one message
   that contains multiple language versions of the same information.
   The translations would be identified by a language code and selected
   by the email client based on a user's language settings or locale.

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type         October 2015


1.  Introduction

   Since the invention of email and the rapid spread of the Internet,
   more and more people have been able to communicate in more and more
   countries and in more and more languages.  But during this time of
   technological evolution, email has remained a single-language
   communication tool, whether it is English to English, Spanish to
   Spanish or Japanese to Japanese.

   Also during this time, many corporations have established their
   offices in multi-cultural cities and formed departments and teams
   that span continents, cultures and languages, so the need to
   communicate efficiently with little margin for miscommunication has
   grown exponentially.

   The objective of this document is to define an addition to the
   Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) standard, to make it
   possible to send a single message to a group of people in such a way
   that all of the recipients can read the email in their preferred
   language.  The methods of translation of the message content are
   beyond the scope of this document, but the structure of the email
   itself is defined herein.

   Whilst this document depends on identification of language in message
   parts for non-real-time communication, there is a companion document
   that is concerned with a similar problem for real-time communication:
   [I-D.gellens-slim-negotiating-human-language]

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Content-Type Header Field

   The "multipart/multilingual" MIME subtype allows the sending of a
   message in a number of different languages with the translations
   embedded in the same message.  This MIME subtype helps the receiving
   email client make sense of the message structure.

   The multipart subtype "multipart/multilingual" has similar semantics
   to "multipart/alternative" (as discussed in RFC 2046 [RFC2046]) in
   that each of the message parts is an alternative version of the same
   information.  The primary difference between "multipart/multilingual"
   and "multipart/alternative" is that when using "multipart/
   multilingual", the message part to select for rendering is chosen
   based on the values of the Content-Language field and optionally the

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type         October 2015


   Translation-Type parameter of the Content-Language field instead of
   the ordering of the parts and the Content-Types.

   The syntax for this multipart subtype conforms to the common syntax
   for subtypes of multipart given in section 5.1.1. of RFC 2046
   [RFC2046].  An example "multipart/multilingual" Content-Type header
   field would look like this:

   Content-Type: multipart/multilingual; boundary=01189998819991197253

3.  The Message Parts

   A multipart/multilingual message will have a number of message parts:
   exactly one multilingual preface, one or more language message parts
   and zero or one unmatched message part.  The details of these are
   described below.

3.1.  The Multilingual Preface

   In order for the message to be received and displayed in non-
   conforming email clients, the message SHOULD contain an explanatory
   message part which MUST NOT be marked with a Content-Language field
   and MUST be the first of the message parts.  Because non-conforming
   email clients are expected to treat the message as multipart/mixed
   (in accordance with sections 5.1.3 and 5.1.7 of RFC 2046 [RFC2046])
   they may show all of the message parts sequentially or as
   attachments.  Including and showing this explanatory part will help
   the message recipient understand the message structure.

   This initial message part SHOULD explain briefly to the recipient
   that the message contains multiple languages and the parts may be
   rendered sequentially or as attachments.  This SHOULD be presented in
   the same languages that are provided in the subsequent language
   message parts.

   Whilst this section of the message is useful for backward
   compatibility, it will normally only be shown when rendered by a non-
   conforming email client, because conforming email clients SHOULD only
   show the single language message part identified by the user's
   preferred language (or locale) and the language message part's
   Content-Language.

   For the correct display of the multilingual preface in a non-
   conforming email client, the sender MAY use the Content-Disposition
   field with a value of 'inline' in conformance with RFC 2183 [RFC2183]
   (which defines the Content-Disposition field).  If provided, this
   SHOULD be placed at the multipart/multilingual level and in the
   multilingual preface.  This makes it clear to a non-conforming email



Tomkinson & Borenstein   Expires April 17, 2016                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type         October 2015


   client that the multilingual preface should be displayed immediately
   to the recipient, followed by any subsequent parts marked as
   'inline'.

   For an example of a multilingual preface, see the examples in
   Section 8.

3.2.  The Language Message Parts

   The language message parts are translations of the same message
   content.  These message parts MAY be ordered so that the first part
   after the multilingual preface is in the language believed to be the
   most likely to be recognised by the recipient.  All of the language
   message parts MUST have a Content-Language field and a Content-Type
   field, they SHOULD have a Subject field and MAY have a Translation-
   Type parameter applied to the Content-Language field.

   The Content-Type for each individual language part MAY be any MIME
   type (including multipart subtypes such as multipart/alternative).
   However, it is RECOMMENDED that the Content-Type of the language
   parts is kept as simple as possible for interoperability with
   existing email clients.  The language parts are not required to have
   matching Content-Types or multipart structures.  For example, there
   might be an English part of type "text/html" followed by a Spanish
   part of type "application/pdf" followed by a Chinese part of type
   "image/jpeg".  Whatever the content-type, the contents SHOULD be
   composed for optimal viewing in the specified language.

   For a non-multipart type, it is RECOMMENDED that the sender applies a
   Name parameter to the Content-Type field.  This will help the
   recipient identify the translations when the translations are
   rendered as attachments by a non-conforming email client.

   An example of this parameter is as follows:

   Content-Type: text/plain; name="english.txt"

3.3.  The Unmatched Message Part

   If there is content intended for the recipient to see if they have a
   preferred language other than one of those specified in the language
   parts, another part MAY be provided.  This would also be useful when
   a language independent graphic is available.  When this unmatched
   part is present, it MUST be the last part, MUST NOT have a Content-
   Language field and SHOULD NOT have a Subject field.

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type         October 2015


4.  Message Part Selection

   The logic for selecting the message part to render and present to the
   recipient is quite straightforward and is summarised in the next few
   paragraphs.

   Firstly, if the email client does not understand multipart/
   multilingual then it SHOULD treat the message as if it was multipart/
   mixed and render message parts accordingly.

   If the email client does understand multipart/multilingual then it
   SHOULD ignore the multilingual preface and select the best match for
   the user's preferred language from the language message parts
   available.  Also, the user may prefer to see the original message
   content in their second language over a machine translation in their
   first language.  The Translation-Type parameter of the Content-
   Language field value can be used for further selection based on this
   preference.  The selection of language part may be implemented in a
   variety of ways and is a matter for the email client and its user
   preferences.  The goal is to render the most appropriate translation
   for the user.  Similarly, the subject to display (for example in a
   message listing) should be chosen from the selected language message
   part if it is available.

   If there is no match for the user's preferred language (or there is
   no preferred language information available) the email client SHOULD
   select the unmatched part (if one exists) or the first language part
   (directly after the multilingual preface) if an unmatched part does
   not exist.  The top-level Subject header field value should be used
   whenever a suitable translation cannot be identified.

   If there is no translation type preference information available, the
   values of the Translation-Type parameter may be ignored.

   Additionally, interactive implementations MAY offer the user a choice
   from among the available languages.

5.  The Content-Language Field

   The Content-Language field in the individual language message parts
   is used to identify the language in which the message part is
   written.  Based on the value of this field, a conforming email client
   can determine which message part to display (given the user's
   language settings or locale).

   The Content-Language MUST comply with RFC 3282 [RFC3282] (which
   defines the Content-Language field) and BCP 47/RFC 5646 [RFC5646]
   (which defines the structure and semantics for the language code



Tomkinson & Borenstein   Expires April 17, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type         October 2015


   values).  While RFC 5646 provides a mechanism accommodating
   increasingly fine-grained distinctions, in the interest of maximum
   interoperability, each Content-Language value SHOULD be restricted to
   the largest granularity of language tags; in other words, it is
   RECOMMENDED to specify only a Primary-subtag and NOT to include
   subtags (e.g., for region or dialect) unless the languages might be
   mutually incomprehensible without them.  Examples of this field for
   English, German and an instruction manual in Spanish and French,
   could look like the following:

   Content-Language: en

   Content-Language: de

   Content-Language: es, fr

6.  The Translation-Type Parameter

   The Translation-Type parameter can be applied to the Content-Language
   field in the individual language message parts and is used to
   identify the type of translation.  Based on the value of this
   parameter and the user's preferences, a conforming email client can
   determine which message part to display.

   This parameter can have one of three possible values: 'original',
   'human' or 'automated' although other values may be added in the
   future.  A value of 'original' is given in the language message part
   that is in the original language.  A value of 'human' is used when a
   language message part is translated by a human translator or a human
   has checked and corrected an automated translation.  A value of
   'automated' is used when a language message part has been translated
   by an electronic agent without proofreading or subsequent correction.

   Examples of this parameter include:

   Content-Language: en; translation-type=original

   Content-Language: fr; translation-type=human

7.  The Subject Field in the Language Message parts

   On receipt of the message, conforming email clients will need to
   render the subject in the correct language for the recipient.  To
   enable this the Subject field SHOULD be provided in each language
   message part.  The value for this field should be a translation of
   the email subject.

   US-ASCII and 'encoded-word' examples of this field include:
