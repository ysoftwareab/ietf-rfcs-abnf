Abstract

   This memo describes a scalable routing scheme for ICN regardless of
   the underlying network protocols. When Lookup-By-Name routing (LBNR)
   is used the first thing to do is name to locator resolution. Once the
   locator is acquired, discovery and delivery steps are carried out
   based on the network protocol of the locator. However, if the
   requestor and contents server are in heterogeneous networks discovery
   and delivery step could not be carried out smoothly. To let this
   happen seamlessly we propose scalable routing scheme based on
   hierarchically-organized domain structure. This scheme is independent
   of underlying network protocols and is more scalable thanks to the
   abstraction of location spaces. Internet is projected as spaces (i.e.
   domains) which have hierarchical relationship among them, and each
   node which belongs to a domain can be reached through "locator" which
   is a concatenation of "domain IDs".

1. Introduction

   ICN routing locates a data object based on its name which is
   initially provided by a requestor. ICN routing may comprise 3 steps:
   a name resolution step, a discovery step, and a delivery step.
   Depending on how these steps are combined, ICN routing schemes can be
   categorized as RBNR, LBNR, and HR [ICN challenges].

   If LBNR is used a Name Resolution System (NRS) translates the name of
   requesting data object into its locator as the first step. Once the
   locator for the name is obtained discovery and delivery may depend on
   the network protocol of locator.

   The problem is that it is often not possible to get the locator that
   is routable in requestor's domain (i.e. the case that requestor and
   contents server are in heterogeneous networks). If this happens it
   would not be easy way to reach contents server from requestor or vice
   versa.

   The routing scheme that we propose operates regardless of underlying
   network protocol, and it is scalable thanks to the hierarchically
   composed domain structure. Each node in a domain can be reached
   through locator which is expressed as a form of concatenation of
   domain IDs. Each domain gateway, a kind of border router for each
   domain, runs routing protocol to build routing table based on the
   locators. This is a variation of link-state routing protocol, and
   suppresses LSA storm by using LSA-filtering rule between parent and
   child domain.

3. Terminologies

   o Domain: a logical/physical group of nodes (requestor, contents
      server, or other "domain") which have similar characteristics (E.g.
      network protocol, geographical region, same type of contents,
      similar category of contents etc.).

   o Locator: in this memo, locator is a concatenation of IDs of
      hierarchically organized domains.

   o Domain Gateway: a kind of border gateway for a domain. The domain
      gateway forwards discovery messaged or NDO data, and runs routing
      protocol based on locator.

   In our scheme network is projected as a set of domains, and each of
   which could be decomposed into other domains recursively. Figure 1
   shows an example of domain structure. All traffic to and from a
   domain should pass through a domain gateway.

4.1.1. Locator

   Each domain has its own ID (domain Id). The concatenation of domain
   IDs from top level domain to the current domain plays the role of
   "locator" for the current domain. (E.g. locator for server3 is
   0x0B:0x0D).

4.2. Name Resolution System (NRS)

   In Name resolution step a requestor queries current locator of a name
   to the NRS. For fast processing hashing technique (like bloom filter)
   could be used to implement NRS. More detailed structure is out of
   scope of this memo (it will be dealt in other I-D).

4.3. Locator-based Routing

   Each domain gateway runs modified link-state routing protocol. Each
   LSA transfers "locator" instead of IP prefix. Thus, locators appears
   in destination field of routing table.

   To suppress LSA storm each domain gateway forwards LSAs to the other
   domain gateways according to the following filtering rules:

   o LSAs in tier N domain are forwarded to all domain gateways in same
      tier domain.

   o LSAs in tier N-1 are injected to tier N gateways.

   o LSAs in tier N+1 are filtered, LSA which has aggregated locator is
      injected to tier N instead. (E.g. [GW #2] delivers LSA which
      includes 0x0B:0x0C to [GW #1], locator for domain 0x0E
      (0x0B:0x0C:0x0E) is not flooded into [GW #1]).

   This results in topology reduction effect. Therefore, each domain
   gateway would have topology graph which is as reduced as possible in
   its current position.

4.4. Server Discovery (path discovery)

   When a requestor gets locator for a specific NDO from NRS, it build a
   path discovery message and forwards to the default domain gateway (in
   this example, "requestor A" send path discovery message to GW #1).
   The path discovery message includes followings:

   +------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Network header                                                   |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Requestor's ID                                                   |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | NDO's ID                                                         |

   +------------------------------------------------------------------+

   If a domain gateway receives path discovery message, it looks up its
   forwarding cache table firstly. If there is no forwarding cache entry
   for the NDO's ID, the domain gateway builds new forwarding cache
   entry. The domain gateway searches its routing table by using
   "locator (included in the path discovery message)" as key, then it
   builds forwarding cache entry for the NDO's ID and requestor's ID.

   Forwarding cache entry for NDO includes followings:

   o NDO's ID

   o Next hop information (found in the routing table entry)

   Forwarding cache entry for the requestor includes followings:

   o Requestor's ID

   o Previous hop information (found in the network header)

   After building the forwarding cache, the path discovery message is
   forwarded to the next hop domain gateway (network header is changed
   according to the next-hop information of forwarding cache), and
   repeat this procedure until it reaches domain which includes the NDO.

   Forwarding caches are managed in the manner of timer-based way.

4.5. Name-based Forwarding (Name-based delivery)

   When the contents server which has requested NDO receives path
   discovery message, it sends NDO data by using following message
   format:

   | Requestor's ID                                                   |

   | NDO data                                                         |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Network header would be changed according to the next hop information
   of forwarding cache.

4.6. Mobility Support

   Mobility support can be implemented very easily because path
   discovery message and data delivery packet don't include any
   location-related information. Usually any domain gateway which
   detects movement of node (requestor or server) re-starts path
   discovery procedure, then several forwarding caches on the path will
   be up-to date. There is almost few things that nodes should do.

5. Security Considerations

   TBD.

6. IANA Considerations

   TBD.
