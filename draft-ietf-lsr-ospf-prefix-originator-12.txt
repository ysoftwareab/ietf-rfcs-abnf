                   OSPF Prefix Originator Extensions
                draft-ietf-lsr-ospf-prefix-originator-12

Abstract

   This document defines OSPF extensions to include information
   associated with the node originating a prefix along with the prefix
   advertisement.  These extensions do not change the core OSPF route
   computation functionality but provide useful information for network
   analysis, troubleshooting, and use-cases like traffic engineering.

1.  Introduction

   Prefix attributes are advertised in OSPFv2 [RFC2328] using the
   Extended Prefix Opaque Link State Advertisement (LSA) [RFC7684] and
   in OSPFv3 [RFC5340] using the various Extended Prefix LSA types
   [RFC8362].

   The procedures for identification of the originating router for a
   prefix in OSPF vary by the type of the prefix and, currently, it is
   not always possible to produce an accurate result.  For intra-area
   prefixes, the originating router is identified by the Advertising
   Router field of the area-scoped LSA used for those prefix
   advertisements.  However, for the inter-area prefixes advertised by
   the Area Border Router (ABR), the Advertising Router field of their
   area-scoped LSAs is set to the ABR itself and the information about
   the router originating the prefix advertisement is lost in this
   process of prefix propagation across areas.  For Autonomous System
   (AS) external prefixes, the originating router may be considered as
   the Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) and is identified by the
   Advertising Router field of the AS-scoped LSA used.  However, the
   actual originating router for the prefix may be a remote router
   outside the OSPF domain.  Similarly, when an ABR performs translation
   of Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA) [RFC3101] LSAs to AS-external LSAs, the

Internet-Draft      OSPF Prefix Originator Extensions         April 2021


   information associated with the NSSA ASBR (or the router outside the
   OSPF domain) is not conveyed across the OSPF domain.

   While typically the originator of information in OSPF is identified
   by its OSPF Router ID, it does not necessarily represent a reachable
   address for the router since the OSPF Router ID is a 32-bit number.
   There exists a prevalent practice to use one of the IPv4 address of
   the node (e.g. a loopback interface) as an OSPF Router ID in the case
   of OSPFv2.  However, this cannot be always assumed and this approach
   does not extend to IPv6 addresses with OSPFv3.  The IPv4/IPv6 Router
   Address as defined in [RFC3630] and [RFC5329] for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3
   respectively provide an address to reach that router.

   The primary use case for the extensions proposed in this document is
   to be able to identify the originator of a prefix in the network.  In
   cases where multiple prefixes are advertised by a given router, it is
   also useful to be able to associate all these prefixes with a single
   router even when prefixes are advertised outside of the area in which
   they originated.  It also helps to determine when the same prefix is
   being originated by multiple routers across areas.

   This document proposes extensions to the OSPF protocol for the
   inclusion of information associated with the router originating the
   prefix along with the prefix advertisement.  These extensions do not
   change the core OSPF route computation functionality.  They provide
   useful information for topology analysis and traffic engineering,
   especially on a controller when this information is advertised as an
   attribute of the prefixes via mechanisms such as Border Gateway
   Protocol Link-State (BGP-LS) [RFC7752]
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-ext].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Protocol Extensions

   This document defines the Prefix Source OSPF Router-ID and the Prefix
   Source Router Address Sub-TLVs.  They are used, respectively, to
   include the Router ID of, and a reachable address of, the router that
   originates the prefix as a prefix attribute.

Internet-Draft      OSPF Prefix Originator Extensions         April 2021


2.1.  Prefix Source OSPF Router-ID Sub-TLV

   For OSPFv2, the Prefix Source OSPF Router-ID Sub-TLV is an optional
   Sub-TLV of the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV [RFC7684].  For OSPFv3, the
   Prefix Source OSPF Router-ID Sub-TLV is an optional Sub-TLV of the
   Intra-Area-Prefix TLV, Inter-Area-Prefix TLV, and External-Prefix TLV
   [RFC8362] when originating either an IPv4 [RFC5838] or an IPv6 prefix
   advertisement.

   The Prefix Source OSPF Router-ID Sub-TLV has the following format:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |               Type            |              Length           |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                        OSPF Router ID                         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         Figure 1: Prefix Source OSPF Router-ID Sub-TLV Format

    Where:

   o  Type: 4 for OSPFv2 and 27 for OSPFv3

   o  Length: 4

   o  OSPF Router ID : the OSPF Router ID of the OSPF router that
      originated the prefix advertisement in the OSPF domain.

   The parent TLV of a prefix advertisement MAY include more than one
   Prefix Source OSPF Router-ID sub-TLV, one corresponding to each of
   the Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) nodes that originated the given
   prefix.

   For intra-area prefix advertisements, the Prefix Source OSPF Router-
   ID Sub-TLV MUST be considered invalid and ignored if the OSPF Router
   ID field is not the same as the Advertising Router field in the
   containing LSA.  Similar validation cannot be reliably performed for
   inter-area and external prefix advertisements.

   A received Prefix Source OSPF Router-ID Sub-TLV with OSPF Router ID
   set to 0 MUST be considered invalid and ignored.  Additionally,
   reception of such Sub-TLV SHOULD be logged as an error (subject to
   rate-limiting).

2.2.  Prefix Source Router Address Sub-TLV

   For OSPFv2, the Prefix Source Router Address Sub-TLV is an optional
   Sub-TLV of the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV [RFC7684].  For OSPFv3, the
   Prefix Source Router Address Sub-TLV is an optional Sub-TLV of the
   Intra-Area-Prefix TLV, Inter-Area-Prefix TLV, and External-Prefix TLV
   [RFC8362] when originating either an IPv4 [RFC5838] or an IPv6 prefix
   advertisement.

   The Prefix Source Router Address Sub-TLV has the following format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |              Router Address (4 or 16 octets)                  |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

          Figure 2: Prefix Source Router Address Sub-TLV Format

    Where:

   o  Type: 5 (suggested) for OSPFv2 and 28 (suggested) for OSPFv3

   o  Length: 4 or 16

   o  Router Address: A reachable IPv4 or IPv6 router address for the
      router that originated the IPv4 or IPv6 prefix advertisement
      respectively.  Such an address would be semantically equivalent to
      what may be advertised in the OSPFv2 Router Address TLV [RFC3630]
      or in the OSPFv3 Router IPv6 Address TLV [RFC5329].

   The parent TLV of a prefix advertisement MAY include more than one
   Prefix Source Router Address Sub-TLV, one corresponding to each of
   the Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) nodes that originated the given
   prefix.

   A received Prefix Source Router Address Sub-TLV that has an invalid
   length (i.e. not consistent with the prefix's address family) MUST be
   considered invalid and ignored.  Additionally, reception of such Sub-
   TLV SHOULD be logged as an error (subject to rate-limiting).

3.  Elements of Procedure

   This section describes the procedure for the advertisement of the
   Prefix Source OSPF Router-ID and Prefix Source Router Address Sub-
   TLVs along with the prefix advertisement.



Wang, et al.            Expires October 11, 2021                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      OSPF Prefix Originator Extensions         April 2021


   The OSPF Router ID of the Prefix Source OSPF Router-ID is set to the
   OSPF Router ID of the node originating the prefix in the OSPF domain.

   If the originating node is advertising an OSPFv2 Router Address TLV
   [RFC3630] or an OSPFv3 Router IPv6 Address TLV [RFC5329], then the
   same address MUST be used in the Router Address field of the Prefix
   Source Router Address Sub-TLV.  When the originating node is not
   advertising such an address, implementations can determine a unique
   and reachable address (for example, advertised with the N-flag set
   [RFC7684] or N-bit set [RFC8362]) belonging to the originating node
   to set in the Router Address field.

   When an ABR generates inter-area prefix advertisements into its non-
   backbone areas corresponding to an inter-area prefix advertisement
   from the backbone area, the only way to determine the originating
   node information is based on the Prefix Source OSPF Router-ID and
   Prefix Source Router Address Sub-TLVs present in the inter-area
   prefix advertisement originated into the backbone area by an ABR from
   another non-backbone area.  The ABR performs its prefix calculation
   to determine the set of nodes that contribute to the best prefix
   reachability.  It MUST use the prefix originator information only
   from this set of nodes.  The ABR MUST NOT include the Prefix Source
   OSPF Router-ID or the Prefix Source Router Address Sub-TLVs when it
   is unable to determine the information of the best originating nodes.

   Implementations may support the propagation of the originating node
   information along with a redistributed prefix into the OSPF domain
   from another routing domain.  The details of such mechanisms are
   outside the scope of this document.  Such implementations may also
   provide control on whether the Router Address in the Prefix Source
   Router Address Sub-TLV is set as the ABSR node address or as the
   address of the actual node outside the OSPF domain that owns the
   prefix.

   When translating the NSSA prefix advertisements [RFC3101] to the AS
   external prefix advertisements, the NSSA ABR, follows the same
   procedures as an ABR generating inter-area prefix advertisements for
   the propagation of the originating node information.

4.  Security Considerations

   Since this document extends the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix LSA, the
   security considerations for [RFC7684] are applicable.  Similarly,
   since this document extends the OSPFv3 E-Intra-Area-Prefix-LSA, E-
   Inter-Area-Prefix-LSA, E-AS-External LSA, and E-NSSA-LSA, the
   security considerations for [RFC8362] are applicable.  The new sub-
   TLVs introduced in this document are optional and do not affect the

Internet-Draft      OSPF Prefix Originator Extensions         April 2021


   OSPF route computation and therefore do not affect the security
   aspects of OSPF protocol operations.

   A rogue node that can inject prefix advertisements may use the new
   extensions introduced in this document to indicate an incorrect
   prefix source information.

5.  Operational Considerations

   Consideration should be given to the operational impact of the
   increase in the size of the OSPF Link-State Database as a result of
   the protocol extensions in this document.  Based on deployment design
   and requirements, a subset of prefixes may be identified for which
   the originating node information needs to be included with their
   prefix advertisements.

   The propagation of the prefix source node information when doing
   prefix advertisements across OSPF area or domain boundaries results
   in the exposure of node information outside of an area or domain
   within which it is normally hidden or abstracted by the base OSPF
   protocol.  Based on deployment design and requirements, a subset of
   prefixes may be identified for which the propagation of the
   originating node information across area or domain boundaries is
   disabled at the ABRs or ASBRs respectively.

   The identification of the node that is originating a specific prefix
   in the network may aid in debugging of issues related to prefix
   reachability within an OSPF network.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA for the allocation of the codepoints from
   the "OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV Sub-TLVs" registry under the "Open
   Shortest Path First v2 (OSPFv2) Parameters" registry.
