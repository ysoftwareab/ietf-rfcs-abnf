1.  Introduction

   Reliable Server Pooling as described in [RFC5351] defines protocols
   for providing highly available services.  The management component
   used for pool administration is denoted as ENRP Server or Pool
   Registrar (PR).  Since a single ENRP server constitutes a single
   point of failure, there must be multiple ENRP servers.  Servers,
   denoted as Pool Elements (PE), use an arbitrary ENRP server for
   registration into the pool.  The chosen ENRP server becomes the Home
   ENRP Server, also denoted as Home PR (PR-H), of the PE.  It is
   responsible for making the PE identity known to the other ENRP
   servers (by using ENRP_HANDLE_UPDATE messages) and also to monitor
   the PE health (by using keep-alive messages).

   As shown in [AINA2009], the following scenario leads to unbalanced
   ENRP server workload: consider a set of multiple ENRP servers with
   one subset being unreliable (for example, their network connection
   has problems) and some reliable ENRP servers.  After a while, the
   reliable ENRP server will get the home ENRP server role for almost
   all of the PEs, which results in high workload for this ENRP server.
   Since the home ENRP server role is more computation-intensive (as
   shown by [IJHIT2008]), this leads to highly unbalanced workload for
   large RSerPool setups.  This unbalanced workload remains, even when
   the unreliable ENRP servers become reliable again (for example, when
   the network problems have been solved).

1.1.  Scope

   The Takeover Suggestion Flag defined in this draft defines a flag for
   the ENRP_HANDLE_UPDATE message.  If the flag is set, the receiving

Internet-Draft          Takeover Suggestion Flag          September 2021


   ENRP server is suggested to take over the PE specified in the
   ENRP_HANDLE_UPDATE message.

1.2.  Terminology

   The terms are commonly identified in related work and can be found in
   the RSerPool Overview document RFC 5351 [RFC5351].

1.3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Takeover Suggestion Flag

2.1.  Definition

   In this subsection, only the differences to the ENRP_HANDLE_UPDATE
   message defined in [RFC5353] are explained.  The following figure
   shows the ENRP_HANDLE_UPDATE message:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      :                    Pool Element Parameter                     :
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   T flag: 1 bit (boolean)

   If set, the receiving ENRP server is suggested to take over the PE
   specified by the Pool Handle and Pool Element Parameters.  It is
   RECOMMENDED for the receiving ENRP server to perform this takeover if
   it has the resources to do so.

3.  Reference Implementation

   The RSerPool reference implementation RSPLIB can be found at
   [RSerPool-Website].  It supports the functionalities defined by
   [RFC5351], [RFC5352], [RFC5353], [RFC5354] and [RFC5356] as well as
   the options [I-D.dreibholz-rserpool-asap-hropt],
   [I-D.dreibholz-rserpool-delay] and of course the option defined by
   this document.  An introduction to this implementation is provided in
   [Dre2006].

4.  Testbed Platform

   A large-scale and realistic Internet testbed platform with support
   for the multi-homing feature of the underlying SCTP protocol is
   NorNet.  A description of NorNet is provided in [PAMS2013-NorNet],
   some further information can be found on the project website
   [NorNet-Website].

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for RSerPool systems are described by
   [RFC5355].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require additional IANA actions beyond those
   already identified in the ENRP and ASAP protocol specifications.
