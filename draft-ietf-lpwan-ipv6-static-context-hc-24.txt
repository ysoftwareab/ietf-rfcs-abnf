 Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) and fragmentation for LPWAN,
                        application to UDP/IPv6
               draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc-24

Abstract

   This document defines the Static Context Header Compression (SCHC)
   framework, which provides both a header compression mechanism and an
   optional fragmentation mechanism.  SCHC has been designed for Low
   Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN).

   SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored both in
   the LPWAN device and in the network infrastructure side.  This
   document defines a generic header compression mechanism and its
   application to compress IPv6/UDP headers.

   This document also specifies an optional fragmentation and reassembly
   mechanism.  It can be used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over
   the LPWAN technologies.  Fragmentation is needed for IPv6 datagrams
   that, after SCHC compression or when such compression was not
   possible, still exceed the layer-2 maximum payload size.

   The SCHC header compression and fragmentation mechanisms are
   independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which they are
   used.  This document defines generic functionalities and offers
   flexibility with regard to parameter settings and mechanism choices.
   This document standardizes the exchange over the LPWAN between two
   SCHC entities.  Settings and choices specific to a technology or a
   product are expected to be grouped into profiles, which are specified
   in other documents.  Data models for the context and profiles are out
   of scope.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines the Static Context Header Compression (SCHC)
   framework, which provides both a header compression mechanism and an
   optional fragmentation mechanism.  SCHC has been designed for Low
   Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN).

   LPWAN technologies impose some strict limitations on traffic.  For
   instance, devices sleep most of the time and may only receive data
   during short periods of time after transmission, in order to preserve
   battery.  LPWAN technologies are also characterized by a greatly
   reduced data unit and/or payload size (see [RFC8376]).

   Header compression is needed for efficient Internet connectivity to a
   node within an LPWAN network.  The following properties of LPWAN
   networks can be exploited to get an efficient header compression:

   o  The network topology is star-oriented, which means that all
      packets between the same source-destination pair follow the same
      path.  For the needs of this document, the architecture can simply
      be described as Devices (Dev) exchanging information with LPWAN
      Application Servers (App) through a Network Gateway (NGW).

   o  Because devices embed built-in applications, the traffic flows to
      be compressed are known in advance.  Indeed, new applications are
      less frequently installed in an LPWAN device, than they are in a
      general-purpose computer or smartphone.

   SCHC compression uses a Context (a set of Rules) in which information
   about header fields is stored.  This Context is static: the values of
   the header fields and the actions to do compression/decompression do
   not change over time.  This avoids the need for complex
   resynchronization mechanisms.  Indeed, a return path may be more
   restricted/expensive, sometimes completely unavailable [RFC8376].  A
   compression protocol that relies on feedback is not compatible with
   the characteristics of such LPWANs.

   In most cases, a small Rule identifier is enough to represent the
   full IPv6/UDP headers.  The SCHC header compression mechanism is
   independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which it is used.

   Furthermore, some LPWAN technologies do not provide a fragmentation
   functionality; to support the IPv6 MTU requirement of 1280 bytes
   [RFC8200], they require a fragmentation protocol at the adaptation
   layer below IPv6.  Accordingly, this document defines an optional
   fragmentation/reassembly mechanism for LPWAN technologies to support
   the IPv6 MTU requirement.

   This document defines generic functionality and offers flexibility
   with regard to parameters settings and mechanism choices.
   Technology-specific settings are expected to be grouped into Profiles
   specified in other documents.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  LPWAN Architecture

   LPWAN network architectures are similar among them, but each LPWAN
   technology names architecture elements differently.  In this
   document, we use terminology from [RFC8376], which identifies the
   following entities in a typical LPWAN network (see Figure 1):

   o Devices (Dev) are the end-devices or hosts (e.g., sensors,
   actuators, etc.).  There can be a very high density of devices per
   radio gateway.

   o The Radio Gateway (RGW) is the end point of the constrained link.

   o The Network Gateway (NGW) is the interconnection node between the
   Radio Gateway and the Internet.

   o Application Server (App) is the end point of the application level
   protocol on the Internet side.

4.  Terminology

   This section defines the terminology and acronyms used in this
   document.  It extends the terminology of [RFC8376].

   The SCHC acronym is pronounced like "sheek" in English (or "chic" in
   French).  Therefore, this document writes "a SCHC Packet" instead of
   "an SCHC Packet".

   o  App: LPWAN Application, as defined by [RFC8376].  An application
      sending/receiving packets to/from the Dev.

   o  AppIID: Application Interface Identifier.  The IID that identifies
      the application server interface.

   o  Bi: Bidirectional.  Characterizes a Field Descriptor that applies
      to headers of packets traveling in either direction (Up and Dw,
      see this glossary).

   o  CDA: Compression/Decompression Action.  Describes the pair of
      actions that are performed at the compressor to compress a header
      field and at the decompressor to recover the original value of the
      header field.

   o  Compression Residue.  The bits that remain to be sent (beyond the
      Rule ID itself) after applying the SCHC compression.

   o  Context: A set of Rules used to compress/decompress headers.

   o  Dev: Device, as defined by [RFC8376].

   o  DevIID: Device Interface Identifier.  The IID that identifies the
      Dev interface.

   o  DI: Direction Indicator.  This field tells which direction of
      packet travel (Up, Dw or Bi) a Field Description applies to.  This
      allows for asymmetric processing, using the same Rule.

   o  Dw: Downlink direction for compression/decompression, from SCHC C/
      D in the network to SCHC C/D in the Dev.

   o  Field Description.  A tuple containing identifier, value, matching
      operator and actions to be applied to a field.

   o  FID: Field Identifier.  This identifies the protocol and field a
      Field Description applies to.

   o  FL: Field Length is the length of the original packet header
      field.  It is expressed as a number of bits for header fields of
      fixed lengths or as a type (e.g., variable, token length, ...) for
      field lengths that are unknown at the time of Rule creation.  The
      length of a header field is defined in the corresponding protocol
      specification (such as IPv6 or UDP).

   o  FP: when a Field is expected to appear multiple times in a header,
      Field Position specifies the occurrence this Field Description
      applies to (for example, first uri-path option, second uri-path,
      etc. in a CoAP header), counting from 1.  The value 0 is special
      and means "don't care", see Section 7.3.

   o  IID: Interface Identifier.  See the IPv6 addressing architecture
      [RFC7136].

   o  L2: Layer two.  The immediate lower layer SCHC interfaces with.
      It is provided by an underlying LPWAN technology.  It does not
      necessarily correspond to the OSI model definition of Layer 2.

   o  L2 Word: this is the minimum subdivision of payload data that the
      L2 will carry.  In most L2 technologies, the L2 Word is an octet.
      In bit-oriented radio technologies, the L2 Word might be a single
      bit.  The L2 Word size is assumed to be constant over time for
      each device.

   o  MO: Matching Operator.  An operator used to match a value
      contained in a header field with a value contained in a Rule.

   o  Padding (P).  Extra bits that may be appended by SCHC to a data
      unit that it passes to the underlying Layer 2 for transmission.
      SCHC itself operates on bits, not bytes, and does not have any
      alignment prerequisite.  See Section 9.

   o  Profile: SCHC offers variations in the way it is operated, with a
      number of parameters listed in Appendix D.  A Profile indicates a
      particular setting of all these parameters.  Both ends of a SCHC
      communication must be provisioned with the same Profile
      information and with the same set of Rules before the
      communication starts, so that there is no ambiguity in how they
      expect to communicate.

   o  Rule: A set of Field Descriptions.

   o  Rule ID (Rule Identifier): An identifier for a Rule.  SCHC C/D on
      both sides share the same Rule ID for a given packet.  A set of
      Rule IDs are used to support SCHC F/R functionality.

   o  SCHC C/D: SCHC Compressor/Decompressor.  A mechanism used on both
      sides, at the Dev and at the network, to achieve Compression/
      Decompression of headers.

   o  SCHC F/R: SCHC Fragmentation / Reassembly.  A mechanism used on
      both sides, at the Dev and at the network, to achieve
      Fragmentation / Reassembly of SCHC Packets.

   o  SCHC Packet: A packet (e.g., an IPv6 packet) whose header has been
      compressed as per the header compression mechanism defined in this
      document.  If the header compression process is unable to actually
      compress the packet header, the packet with the uncompressed
      header is still called a SCHC Packet (in this case, a Rule ID is
      used to indicate that the packet header has not been compressed).
      See Section 7 for more details.

   o  TV: Target value.  A value contained in a Rule that will be
      matched with the value of a header field.

   o  Up: Uplink direction for compression/decompression, from the Dev
      SCHC C/D to the network SCHC C/D.

   Additional terminology for the optional SCHC Fragmentation /
   Reassembly mechanism (SCHC F/R) is found in Section 8.2.

5.  SCHC overview

   SCHC can be characterized as an adaptation layer between an upper
   layer (typically, IPv6) and an underlying layer (typically, an LPWAN
   technology).  SCHC comprises two sublayers (i.e. the Compression
   sublayer and the Fragmentation sublayer), as shown in Figure 2.

   Before an upper layer packet (e.g., an IPv6 packet) is transmitted to
   the underlying layer, header compression is first attempted.  The
   resulting packet is called a SCHC Packet, whether or not any
   compression is performed.  If needed by the underlying layer, the
   optional SCHC Fragmentation MAY be applied to the SCHC Packet.  The
   inverse operations take place at the receiver.  This process is
   illustrated in Figure 3.

5.1.  SCHC Packet format

   The SCHC Packet is composed of the Compressed Header followed by the
   payload from the original packet (see Figure 4).  The Compressed
   Header itself is composed of the Rule ID and a Compression Residue,
   which is the output of compressing the packet header with that Rule
   (see Section 7).  The Compression Residue may be empty.  Both the
   Rule ID and the Compression Residue potentially have a variable size,
   and are not necessarily a multiple of bytes in size.

                          Figure 5: Architecture

   SCHC C/D and SCHC F/R are located on both sides of the LPWAN
   transmission, hereafter called "the Dev side" and "the Network
   infrastructure side".

   The operation in the Uplink direction is as follows.  The Device
   application uses IPv6 or IPv6/UDP protocols.  Before sending the
   packets, the Dev compresses their headers using SCHC C/D and, if the
   SCHC Packet resulting from the compression needs to be fragmented by
   SCHC, SCHC F/R is performed (see Section 8).  The resulting SCHC
   Fragments are sent to an LPWAN Radio Gateway (RGW) which forwards
   them to a Network Gateway (NGW).  The NGW sends the data to a SCHC F/
   R for re-assembly (if needed) and then to the SCHC C/D for
   decompression.  After decompression, the packet can be sent over the
   Internet to one or several LPWAN Application Servers (App).

   The SCHC F/R and C/D on the Network infrastructure side can be part
   of the NGW, or located in the Internet as long as a tunnel is
   established between them and the NGW.  For some LPWAN technologies,
   it may be suitable to locate the SCHC F/R functionality nearer the
   NGW, in order to better deal with time constraints of such
   technologies.

   The SCHC C/Ds on both sides MUST share the same set of Rules.  So
   MUST the SCHC F/Rs on both sides.

   The operation in the Downlink direction is similar to that in the
   Uplink direction, only reversing the order in which the architecture
   elements are traversed.

6.  Rule ID

   Rule IDs identify the Rules used for Compression/Decompression or for
   Fragmentation/Reassembly.

   The scope of the Rule ID of a Compression/Decompression Rule is the
   link between the SCHC C/D in a given Dev and the corresponding SCHC
   C/D in the Network infrastructure side.  The scope of the Rule ID of
   a Fragmentation/Reassembly Rule is the link between the SCHC F/R in a
   given Dev and the corresponding SCHC F/R in the Network
   infrastructure side.  If such a link is bidirectional, the scope
   includes both directions.

   Inside their scopes, Rules for Compression/Decompression and Rules
   for Fragmentation/Reassembly share the same Rule ID space.

   The size of the Rule IDs is not specified in this document, as it is
   implementation-specific and can vary according to the LPWAN
   technology and the number of Rules, among others.  It is defined in
   Profiles.

   The Rule IDs are used:

   o  For SCHC C/D, to identify the Rule (i.e., the set of Field
      Descriptions) that is used to compress a packet header.

      *  At least one Rule ID MUST be allocated to tagging packets for
         which SCHC compression was not possible (i.e., no matching
         compression Rule was found).

   o  In SCHC F/R, to identify the specific mode and settings of F/R for
      one direction of traffic (Up or Dw).

      *  When F/R is used for both communication directions, at least
         two Rule ID values are needed for F/R, one per direction of
         traffic.  This is because F/R may entail control messages
         flowing in the reverse direction compared to data traffic.

7.  Compression/Decompression

   Compression with SCHC is based on using a set of Rules, called the
   Context, to compress or decompress headers.  SCHC avoids Context
   synchronization traffic, which consumes considerable bandwidth in
   other header compression mechanisms such as RoHC [RFC5795].  Since



Minaburo, et al.          Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   the content of packets is highly predictable in LPWAN networks,
   static Contexts can be stored beforehand.  The Contexts MUST be
   stored at both ends, and they can be learned by a provisioning
   protocol or by out of band means, or they can be pre-provisioned.
   The way the Contexts are provisioned is out of the scope of this
   document.

7.1.  SCHC C/D Rules

   The main idea of the SCHC compression scheme is to transmit the Rule
   ID to the other end instead of sending known field values.  This Rule
   ID identifies a Rule that matches the original packet values.  Hence,
   when a value is known by both ends, it is only necessary to send the
   corresponding Rule ID over the LPWAN network.  The manner by which
   Rules are generated is out of the scope of this document.  The Rules
   MAY be changed at run-time but the mechanism is out of scope of this
   document.

   The Context is a set of Rules.  See Figure 6 for a high level,
   abstract representation of the Context.  The formal specification of
   the representation of the Rules is outside the scope of this
   document.

   Each Rule itself contains a list of Field Descriptions composed of a
   Field Identifier (FID), a Field Length (FL), a Field Position (FP), a
   Direction Indicator (DI), a Target Value (TV), a Matching Operator
   (MO) and a Compression/Decompression Action (CDA).

   A Rule does not describe how the compressor parses a packet header to
   find and identify each field (e.g., the IPv6 Source Address, the UDP
   Destination Port or a CoAP URI path option).  It is assumed that
   there is a protocol parser alongside SCHC that is able to identify
   all the fields encountered in the headers to be compressed, and to
   label them with a Field ID.  Rules only describe the compression/
   decompression behavior for each header field, after it has been
   identified.

   In a Rule, the Field Descriptions are listed in the order in which
   the fields appear in the packet header.  The Field Descriptions
   describe the header fields with the following entries:

   o  Field ID (FID) designates a protocol and field (e.g., UDP
      Destination Port), unambiguously among all protocols that a SCHC
      compressor processes.  In the presence of protocol nesting, the
      Field ID also identifies the nesting.

   o  Field Length (FL) represents the length of the original field.  It
      can be either a fixed value (in bits) if the length is known when
      the Rule is created or a type if the length is variable.  The
      length of a header field is defined by its own protocol
      specification (e.g., IPv6 or UDP).  If the length is variable, the
      type defines the process to compute the length and its unit (bits,
      bytes...).

   o  Field Position (FP): most often, a field only occurs once in a
      packet header.  However, some fields may occur multiple times.  An
      example is the uri-path of CoAP.  FP indicates which occurrence
      this Field Description applies to.  If FP is not specified in the
      Field Description, it takes the default value of 1.  The value 1
      designates the first occurrence.  The value 0 is special.  It
      means "don't care", see Section 7.3.

   o  A Direction Indicator (DI) indicates the packet direction(s) this
      Field Description applies to.  Three values are possible:

      *  UPLINK (Up): this Field Description is only applicable to
         packets sent by the Dev to the App,

      *  DOWNLINK (Dw): this Field Description is only applicable to
         packets sent from the App to the Dev,

      *  BIDIRECTIONAL (Bi): this Field Description is applicable to
         packets traveling both Up and Dw.

   o  Target Value (TV) is the value used to match against the packet
      header field.  The Target Value can be a scalar value of any type



Minaburo, et al.          Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


      (integer, strings, etc.) or a more complex structure (array, list,
      etc.).  The types and representations are out of scope for this
      document.

   o  Matching Operator (MO) is the operator used to match the Field
      Value and the Target Value.  The Matching Operator may require
      some parameters.  MO is only used during the compression phase.
      The set of MOs defined in this document can be found in
      Section 7.4.

   o  Compression Decompression Action (CDA) describes the compression
      and decompression processes to be performed after the MO is
      applied.  Some CDAs might use parameter values for their
      operation.  CDAs are used in both the compression and the
      decompression functions.  The set of CDAs defined in this document
      can be found in Section 7.5.

7.2.  Rule ID for SCHC C/D

   Rule IDs are sent by the compression function in one side and are
   received for the decompression function in the other side.  In SCHC
   C/D, the Rule IDs are specific to the Context related to one Dev.
   Hence, multiple Dev instances, which refer to different header
   compression Contexts, MAY reuse the same Rule ID for different Rules.
   On the Network infrastructure side, in order to identify the correct
   Rule to be applied, the SCHC Decompressor needs to associate the Rule
   ID with the Dev identifier.  Similarly, the SCHC Compressor on the
   Network infrastructure side first identifies the destination Dev
   before looking for the appropriate compression Rule (and associated
   Rule ID) in the Context of that Dev.

7.3.  Packet processing

   The compression/decompression process follows several phases:

   o  Compression Rule selection: the general idea is to browse the Rule
      set to find a Rule that has a matching Field Descriptor (given the
      DI and FP) for all and only those header fields that appear in the
      packet being compressed.  The detailed algorithm is the following:

      *  The first step is to check the Field Identifiers (FID).  If any
         header field of the packet being examined cannot be matched
         with a Field Description with the correct FID, the Rule MUST be
         disregarded.  If any Field Description in the Rule has a FID
         that cannot be matched to one of the header fields of the
         packet being examined, the Rule MUST be disregarded.





Minaburo, et al.          Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


      *  The next step is to match the Field Descriptions by their
         direction, using the Direction Indicator (DI).  If any field of
         the packet header cannot be matched with a Field Description
         with the correct FID and DI, the Rule MUST be disregarded.

      *  Then the Field Descriptions are further selected according to
         Field Position (FP).  If any field of the packet header cannot
         be matched with a Field Description with the correct FID, DI
         and FP, the Rule MUST be disregarded.

         The value 0 for FP means "don't care", i.e. the comparison of
         this Field Description's FP with the position of the field of
         the packet header being compressed returns True, whatever that
         position.  FP=0 can be useful to build compression Rules for
         protocols headers in which some fields order is irrelevant.  An
         example could be uri-queries in CoAP.  Care needs to be
         exercised when writing Rules containing FP=0 values.  Indeed,
         it may result in decompressed packets having fields ordered
         differently compared to the original packet.

      *  Once each header field has been associated with a Field
         Description with matching FID, DI and FP, each packet field's
         value is then compared to the corresponding Target Value (TV)
         stored in the Rule for that specific field, using the matching
         operator (MO).  If every field in the packet header satisfies
         the corresponding matching operators (MO) of a Rule (i.e. all
         MO results are True), that Rule is valid for use to compress
         the header.  Otherwise, the Rule MUST be disregarded.

         This specification does not prevent multiple Rules from
         matching the above steps and therefore being valid for use.
         Which Rule to use among multiple valid Rules is left to the
         implementation.  As long as the same Rule set is installed at
         both ends, this degree of freedom does not constitute an
         interoperability issue.

      *  If no valid compression Rule is found, then the packet MUST be
         sent uncompressed using the Rule ID dedicated to this purpose
         (see Section 6).  The entire packet header is the Compression
         Residue (see Figure 4).  Sending an uncompressed header is
         likely to require SCHC F/R.

   o  Compression: if a valid Rule was found, each field of the header
      is compressed according to the Compression/Decompression Actions
      (CDAs) of the Rule.  The fields are compressed in the order that
      the Field Descriptions appear in the Rule.  The compression of
      each field results in a residue, which may be empty.  The
      Compression Residue for the packet header is the concatenation of

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


      the non-empty residues for each field of the header, in the order
      the Field Descriptions appear in the Rule.  The order in which the
      Field Descriptions appear in the Rule is therefore semantically
      important.

       |------------------- Compression Residue -------------------|
       +-----------------+-----------------+-----+-----------------+
       | field 1 residue | field 2 residue | ... | field N residue |
       +-----------------+-----------------+-----+-----------------+


                  Figure 7: Compression Residue structure

   o  Sending: The Rule ID is sent to the other end followed by the
      Compression Residue (which could be empty) or the uncompressed
      header, and directly followed by the payload (see Figure 4).  The
      way the Rule ID is sent will be specified in the Profile and is
      out of the scope of the present document.  For example, it could
      be included in an L2 header or sent as part of the L2 payload.

   o  Decompression: when decompressing, on the Network infrastructure
      side the SCHC C/D needs to find the correct Rule based on the L2
      address of the Dev; in this way, it can use the DevIID and the
      Rule ID.  On the Dev side, only the Rule ID is needed to identify
      the correct Rule since the Dev typically only holds Rules that
      apply to itself.

      This Rule describes the compressed header format.  From this, the
      decompressor determines the order of the residues, the fixed-sized
      or variable-sized nature of each residue (see Section 7.5.2), and
      the size of the fixed-sized residues.

      From the received compressed header, it can therefore retrieve all
      the residue values and associate them to the corresponding header
      fields.

      For each field in the header, the receiver applies the CDA action
      associated to that field in order to reconstruct the original
      header field value.  The CDA application order can be different
      from the order in which the fields are listed in the Rule.  In
      particular, Compute-* MUST be applied after the application of the
      CDAs of all the fields it computes on.

7.4.  Matching operators

   Matching Operators (MOs) are functions used by both SCHC C/D
   endpoints.  They are not typed and can be applied to integer, string

   or any other data type.  The result of the operation can either be
   True or False.  MOs are defined as follows:

   o  equal: The match result is True if the field value in the packet
      matches the TV.

   o  ignore: No matching is attempted between the field value in the
      packet and the TV in the Rule.  The result is always true.

   o  MSB(x): A match is obtained if the most significant (leftmost) x
      bits of the packet header field value are equal to the TV in the
      Rule.  The x parameter of the MSB MO indicates how many bits are
      involved in the comparison.  If the FL is described as variable,
      the x parameter must be a multiple of the FL unit.  For example, x
      must be multiple of 8 if the unit of the variable length is bytes.

   o  match-mapping: With match-mapping, the Target Value is a list of
      values.  Each value of the list is identified by an index.
      Compression is achieved by sending the index instead of the
      original header field value.  This operator matches if the header
      field value is equal to one of the values in the target list.

7.5.  Compression Decompression Actions (CDA)

   The Compression Decompression Action (CDA) describes the actions
   taken during the compression of header fields and the inverse action
   taken by the decompressor to restore the original value.

      +--------------+-------------+-------------------------------+
      | Action       | Compression | Decompression                 |
      +--------------+-------------+-------------------------------+
      |              |             |                               |

      | value-sent   | send        | use received value            |
      | mapping-sent | send index  | retrieve value from TV list   |

7.5.1.  processing fixed-length fields

   If the field is identified in the Field Description as being of fixed
   length, then applying the CDA to compress this field results in a
   fixed amount of bits.  The residue for that field is simply the bits
   resulting from applying the CDA to the field.  This value may be
   empty (e.g., not-sent CDA), in which case the field residue is absent
   from the Compression Residue.

   |- field residue -|
   +-----------------+
   |      value      |
   +-----------------+


               Figure 8: fixed sized field residue structure

7.5.2.  processing variable-length fields

   If the field is identified in the Field Description as being of
   variable length, then applying the CDA to compress this field may
   result in a value of fixed size (e.g., not-sent or mapping-sent) or
   of variable size (e.g., value-sent or LSB).  In the latter case, the
   residue for that field is the bits that result from applying the CDA
   to the field, preceded with the size of the value.  The most
   significant bit of the size is stored to the left (leftmost bit of
   the residue field).

   |--- field residue ---|
   +-------+-------------+
   |  size |    value    |
   +-------+-------------+


             Figure 9: variable sized field residue structure

   The size (using the unit defined in the FL) is encoded on 4, 12 or 28
   bits as follows:

   o  If the size is between 0 and 14, it is encoded as a 4 bits
      unsigned integer.

   o  Sizes between 15 and 254 are encoded as 0b1111 followed by the 8
      bits unsigned integer.

   o  Larger sizes are encoded as 0xfff followed by the 16 bits unsigned
      integer.

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   If the field is identified in the Field Description as being of
   variable length and this field is not present in the packet header
   being compressed, size 0 MUST be sent to denote its absence.

7.5.3.  not-sent CDA

   The not-sent action can be used when the field value is specified in
   a Rule and therefore known by both the Compressor and the
   Decompressor.  This action SHOULD be used with the "equal" MO.  If MO
   is "ignore", there is a risk to have a decompressed field value
   different from the original field that was compressed.

   The compressor does not send any residue for a field on which not-
   sent compression is applied.

   The decompressor restores the field value with the Target Value
   stored in the matched Rule identified by the received Rule ID.

7.5.4.  value-sent CDA

   The value-sent action can be used when the field value is not known
   by both the Compressor and the Decompressor.  The field is sent in
   its entirety, using the same bit order as in the original packet
   header.

   If this action is performed on a variable length field, the size of
   the residue value (using the units defined in FL) MUST be sent as
   described in Section 7.5.2.

   This action is generally used with the "ignore" MO.

7.5.5.  mapping-sent CDA

   The mapping-sent action is used to send an index (the index into the
   Target Value list of values) instead of the original value.  This
   action is used together with the "match-mapping" MO.

   On the compressor side, the match-mapping Matching Operator searches
   the TV for a match with the header field value.  The mapping-sent CDA
   then sends the corresponding index as the field residue.  The most
   significant bit of the index is stored to the left (leftmost bit of
   the residue field).

   On the decompressor side, the CDA uses the received index to restore
   the field value by looking up the list in the TV.

   The number of bits sent is the minimal size for coding all the
   possible indices.

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   The first element in the list MUST be represented by index value 0,
   and successive elements in the list MUST have indices incremented by
   1.

7.5.6.  LSB CDA

   The LSB action is used together with the "MSB(x)" MO to avoid sending
   the most significant part of the packet field if that part is already
   known by the receiving end.

   The compressor sends the Least Significant Bits as the field residue
   value.  The number of bits sent is the original header field length
   minus the length specified in the MSB(x) MO.  The bits appear in the
   residue in the same bit order as in the original packet header.

   The decompressor concatenates the x most significant bits of Target
   Value and the received residue value.

   If this action is performed on a variable length field, the size of
   the residue value (using the units defined in FL) MUST be sent as
   described in Section 7.5.2.

7.5.7.  DevIID, AppIID CDA

   These actions are used to process respectively the Dev and the App
   Interface Identifiers (DevIID and AppIID) of the IPv6 addresses.
   AppIID CDA is less common since most current LPWAN technologies
   frames contain a single L2 address, which is the Dev's address.

   The IID value MAY be computed from the Device ID present in the L2
   header, or from some other stable identifier.  The computation is
   specific to each Profile and MAY depend on the Device ID size.

   In the downlink direction (Dw), at the compressor, the DevIID CDA may
   be used to generate the L2 addresses on the LPWAN, based on the
   packet's Destination Address.

7.5.8.  Compute-*

   Some fields can be elided at the compressor and recomputed locally at
   the decompressor.

   Because the field is uniquely identified by its Field ID (e.g., UDP
   length), the relevant protocol specification unambiguously defines
   the algorithm for such computation.

   Examples of fields that know how to recompute themselves are UDP
   length, IPv6 length and UDP checksum.

8.  Fragmentation/Reassembly

8.1.  Overview

   In LPWAN technologies, the L2 MTU typically ranges from tens to
   hundreds of bytes.  Some of these technologies do not have an
   internal fragmentation/reassembly mechanism.

   The optional SCHC Fragmentation/Reassembly (SCHC F/R) functionality
   enables such LPWAN technologies to comply with the IPv6 MTU
   requirement of 1280 bytes [RFC8200].  It is OPTIONAL to implement per
   this specification, but Profiles may specify that it is REQUIRED.

   This specification includes several SCHC F/R modes, which allow for a
   range of reliability options such as optional SCHC Fragment
   retransmission.  More modes may be defined in the future.

   The same SCHC F/R mode MUST be used for all SCHC Fragments of a given
   SCHC Packet.  This document does not specify which mode(s) must be
   implemented and used over a specific LPWAN technology.  That
   information will be given in Profiles.

   SCHC allows transmitting non-fragmented SCHC Packet concurrently with
   fragmented SCHC Packets.  In addition, SCHC F/R provides protocol
   elements that allow transmitting several fragmented SCHC Packets
   concurrently, i.e. interleaving the transmission of fragments from
   different fragmented SCHC Packets.  A Profile MAY restrict the latter
   behavior.

   The L2 Word size (see Section 4) determines the encoding of some
   messages.  SCHC F/R usually generates SCHC Fragments and SCHC ACKs
   that are multiples of L2 Words.

8.2.  SCHC F/R Protocol Elements

   This subsection describes the different elements that are used to
   enable the SCHC F/R functionality defined in this document.  These
   elements include the SCHC F/R messages, tiles, windows, bitmaps,
   counters, timers and header fields.

   The elements are described here in a generic manner.  Their
   application to each SCHC F/R mode is found in Section 8.4.

8.2.1.  Messages

   SCHC F/R defines the following messages:





Minaburo, et al.          Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 22]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   o  SCHC Fragment: A message that carries part of a SCHC Packet from
      the sender to the receiver.

   o  SCHC ACK: An acknowledgement for fragmentation, by the receiver to
      the sender.  This message is used to indicate whether or not the
      reception of pieces of, or the whole of the fragmented SCHC
      Packet, was successful.

   o  SCHC ACK REQ: A request by the sender for a SCHC ACK from the
      receiver.

   o  SCHC Sender-Abort: A message by the sender telling the receiver
      that it has aborted the transmission of a fragmented SCHC Packet.

   o  SCHC Receiver-Abort: A message by the receiver to tell the sender
      to abort the transmission of a fragmented SCHC Packet.

   The format of these messages is provided in Section 8.3.

8.2.2.  Tiles, Windows, Bitmaps, Timers, Counters

8.2.2.1.  Tiles

   The SCHC Packet is fragmented into pieces, hereafter called tiles.
   The tiles MUST be non-empty and pairwise disjoint.  Their union MUST
   be equal to the SCHC Packet.

   See Figure 10 for an example.

                                  SCHC Packet
       +----+--+-----+---+----+-+---+---+-----+...-----+----+---+------+
Tiles  |    |  |     |   |    | |   |   |     |        |    |   |      |
       +----+--+-----+---+----+-+---+---+-----+...-----+----+---+------+


               Figure 10: a SCHC Packet fragmented in tiles

   Modes (see Section 8.4) MAY place additional constraints on tile
   sizes.

   Each SCHC Fragment message carries at least one tile in its Payload,
   if the Payload field is present.

8.2.2.2.  Windows

   Some SCHC F/R modes may handle successive tiles in groups, called
   windows.

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   If windows are used

   o  all the windows of a SCHC Packet, except the last one, MUST
      contain the same number of tiles.  This number is WINDOW_SIZE.

   o  WINDOW_SIZE MUST be specified in a Profile.

   o  the windows are numbered.

   o  their numbers MUST increment by 1 from 0 upward, from the start of
      the SCHC Packet to its end.

   o  the last window MUST contain WINDOW_SIZE tiles or less.

   o  tiles are numbered within each window.

   o  the tile indices MUST decrement by 1 from WINDOW_SIZE - 1
      downward, looking from the start of the SCHC Packet toward its
      end.

   o  each tile of a SCHC Packet is therefore uniquely identified by a
      window number and a tile index within this window.

   See Figure 11 for an example.

         +---------------------------------------------...-------------+
         |                         SCHC Packet                         |
         +---------------------------------------------...-------------+

Tile #   | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 4 |     | 0 | 4 | 3 |
Window # |-------- 0 --------|-------- 1 --------|- 2  ... 27 -|-- 28 -|


    Figure 11: a SCHC Packet fragmented in tiles grouped in 29 windows,
                           with WINDOW_SIZE = 5

   Appendix E discusses the benefits of selecting one among multiple
   window sizes depending on the size of the SCHC Packet to be
   fragmented.

   When windows are used

   o  Bitmaps (see Section 8.2.2.3) MAY be sent back by the receiver to
      the sender in a SCHC ACK message.

   o  A Bitmap corresponds to exactly one Window.

8.2.2.3.  Bitmaps

   Each bit in the Bitmap for a window corresponds to a tile in the
   window.  Each Bitmap has therefore WINDOW_SIZE bits.  The bit at the
   left-most position corresponds to the tile numbered WINDOW_SIZE - 1.
   Consecutive bits, going right, correspond to sequentially decreasing
   tile indices.  In Bitmaps for windows that are not the last one of a
   SCHC Packet, the bit at the right-most position corresponds to the
   tile numbered 0.  In the Bitmap for the last window, the bit at the
   right-most position corresponds either to the tile numbered 0 or to a
   tile that is sent/received as "the last one of the SCHC Packet"
   without explicitly stating its number (see Section 8.3.1.2).

   At the receiver

   o  a bit set to 1 in the Bitmap indicates that a tile associated with
      that bit position has been correctly received for that window.

   o  a bit set to 0 in the Bitmap indicates that there has been no tile
      correctly received, associated with that bit position, for that
      window.  Possible reasons include that the tile was not sent at
      all, not received, or received with errors.

8.2.2.4.  Timers and counters

   Some SCHC F/R modes can use the following timers and counters

   o  Inactivity Timer: a SCHC Fragment receiver uses this timer to
      abort waiting for a SCHC F/R message.

   o  Retransmission Timer: a SCHC Fragment sender uses this timer to
      abort waiting for an expected SCHC ACK.

   o  Attempts: this counter counts the requests for SCHC ACKs, up to
      MAX_ACK_REQUESTS.

8.2.3.  Integrity Checking

   The integrity of the fragmentation-reassembly process of a SCHC
   Packet MUST be checked at the receive end.  A Profile MUST specify
   how integrity checking is performed.

   It is RECOMMENDED that integrity checking be performed by computing a
   Reassembly Check Sequence (RCS) based on the SCHC Packet at the
   sender side and transmitting it to the receiver for comparison with
   the RCS locally computed after reassembly.

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   The RCS supports UDP checksum elision by SCHC C/D (see
   Section 10.11).

   The CRC32 polynomial 0xEDB88320 (i.e., the reversed polynomial
   representation, which is used in the Ethernet standard [ETHERNET]) is
   RECOMMENDED as the default algorithm for computing the RCS.

   The RCS MUST be computed on the full SCHC Packet concatenated with
   the padding bits, if any, of the SCHC Fragment carrying the last
   tile.  The rationale is that the SCHC reassembler has no way of
   knowing the boundary between the last tile and the padding bits.
   Indeed, this requires decompressing the SCHC Packet, which is out of
   the scope of the SCHC reassembler.

   The concatenation of the complete SCHC Packet and any padding bits,
   if present, of the last SCHC Fragment does not generally constitute
   an integer number of bytes.  CRC libraries are usually byte-oriented.
   It is RECOMMENDED that the concatenation of the complete SCHC Packet
   and any last fragment padding bits be zero-extended to the next byte
   boundary and that the RCS be computed on that byte array.

8.2.4.  Header Fields

   The SCHC F/R messages contain the following fields (see the formats
   in Section 8.3):

   o  Rule ID: this field is present in all the SCHC F/R messages.  The
      Rule identifies

      *  that a SCHC F/R message is being carried, as opposed to an
         unfragmented SCHC Packet,

      *  which SCHC F/R mode is used

      *  in case this mode uses windows, what the value of WINDOW_SIZE
         is,

      *  what other optional fields are present and what the field sizes
         are.

      The Rule tells apart a non-fragmented SCHC Packet from SCHC
      Fragments.  It will also tell apart SCHC Fragments of fragmented
      SCHC Packets that use different SCHC F/R modes or different
      parameters.  Interleaved transmission of these is therefore
      possible.

      All SCHC F/R messages pertaining to the same SCHC Packet MUST bear
      the same Rule ID.

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   o  Datagram Tag (DTag).  This field allows differentiating SCHC F/R
      messages belonging to different SCHC Packets that may be using the
      same Rule ID simultaneously.  Hence, it allows interleaving
      fragments of a new SCHC Packet with fragments of a previous SCHC
      Packet under the same Rule ID.

      The size of the DTag field (called T, in bits) is defined by each
      Profile for each Rule ID.  When T is 0, the DTag field does not
      appear in the SCHC F/R messages and the DTag value is defined as
      0.

      When T is 0, there can be no more than one fragmented SCHC Packet
      in transit for each fragmentation Rule ID.

      If T is not 0, DTag

      *  MUST be set to the same value for all the SCHC F/R messages
         related to the same fragmented SCHC Packet,

      *  MUST be set to different values for SCHC F/R messages related
         to different SCHC Packets that are being fragmented under the
         same Rule ID, and whose transmission may overlap.

   o  W: The W field is optional.  It is only present if windows are
      used.  Its presence and size (called M, in bits) is defined by
      each SCHC F/R mode and each Profile for each Rule ID.

      This field carries information pertaining to the window a SCHC F/R
      message relates to.  If present, W MUST carry the same value for
      all the SCHC F/R messages related to the same window.  Depending
      on the mode and Profile, W may carry the full window number, or
      just the least significant bit or any other partial representation
      of the window number.

   o  Fragment Compressed Number (FCN).  The FCN field is present in the
      SCHC Fragment Header.  Its size (called N, in bits) is defined by
      each Profile for each Rule ID.

      This field conveys information about the progress in the sequence
      of tiles being transmitted by SCHC Fragment messages.  For
      example, it can contain a partial, efficient representation of a
      larger-sized tile index.  The description of the exact use of the
      FCN field is left to each SCHC F/R mode.  However, two values are
      reserved for special purposes.  They help control the SCHC F/R
      process:

      *  The FCN value with all the bits equal to 1 (called All-1)
         signals that the very last tile of a SCHC Packet has been

         transmitted.  By extension, if windows are used, the last
         window of a packet is called the All-1 window.

      *  If windows are used, the FCN value with all the bits equal to 0
         (called All-0) signals the last tile of a window that is not
         the last one of the SCHC packet.  By extension, such a window
         is called an All-0 window.

   o  Reassembly Check Sequence (RCS).  This field only appears in the
      All-1 SCHC Fragments.  Its size (called U, in bits) is defined by
      each Profile for each Rule ID.

      See Section 8.2.3 for the RCS default size, default polynomial and
      details on RCS computation.

   o  C (integrity Check): C is a 1-bit field.  This field is used in
      the SCHC ACK message to report on the reassembled SCHC Packet
      integrity check (see Section 8.2.3).

      A value of 1 tells that the integrity check was performed and is
      successful.  A value of 0 tells that the integrity check was not
      performed, or that is was a failure.

   o  Compressed Bitmap.  The Compressed Bitmap is used together with
      windows and Bitmaps (see Section 8.2.2.3).  Its presence and size
      is defined for each F/R mode for each Rule ID.

      This field appears in the SCHC ACK message to report on the
      receiver Bitmap (see Section 8.3.2.1).

8.3.  SCHC F/R Message Formats

   This section defines the SCHC Fragment formats, the SCHC ACK format,
   the SCHC ACK REQ format and the SCHC Abort formats.

8.3.1.  SCHC Fragment format

   A SCHC Fragment conforms to the general format shown in Figure 12.
   It comprises a SCHC Fragment Header and a SCHC Fragment Payload.  The
   SCHC Fragment Payload carries one or several tile(s).

   +-----------------+-----------------------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

8.3.1.1.  Regular SCHC Fragment

   The Regular SCHC Fragment format is shown in Figure 13.  Regular SCHC
   Fragments are generally used to carry tiles that are not the last one
   of a SCHC Packet.  The DTag field and the W field are OPTIONAL, their
   presence is specified by each mode and Profile.

 |--- SCHC Fragment Header ----|
           |-- T --|-M-|-- N --|

 | Rule ID | DTag  | W |  FCN  | Fragment Payload | padding (as needed)
 +-- ... --+- ... -+---+- ... -+--------...-------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Figure 13: Detailed Header Format for Regular SCHC Fragments

   The FCN field MUST NOT contain all bits set to 1.

   Profiles MUST ensure that a SCHC Fragment with FCN equal to 0 (called
   an All-0 SCHC Fragment) is distinguishable by size, even in the
   presence of padding, from a SCHC ACK REQ message (see Section 8.3.3)
   with the same Rule ID value and with the same T, M and N values.
   This condition is met if the Payload is at least the size of an L2
   Word.  This condition is also met if the SCHC Fragment Header is a
   multiple of L2 Words.

8.3.1.2.  All-1 SCHC Fragment

   The All-1 SCHC Fragment format is shown in Figure 14.  The sender
   uses the All-1 SCHC Fragment format for the message that completes
   the emission of a fragmented SCHC Packet.  The DTag field, the W
   field, the RCS field and the Payload are OPTIONAL, their presence is
   specified by each mode and Profile.  At least one of RCS field or
   Payload MUST be present.  The FCN field is all ones.

   distinguishable by size, even in the presence of padding, from a SCHC
   Sender-Abort message (see Section 8.3.4) with the same Rule ID value
   and with the same T, M and N values.  This condition is met if the
   RCS is present and is at least the size of an L2 Word, or if the

   Payload is present and at least the size an L2 Word.  This condition
   is also met if the SCHC Sender-Abort Header is a multiple of L2
   Words.

8.3.2.  SCHC ACK format

   The SCHC ACK message is shown in Figure 15.  The DTag field and the W
   field are OPTIONAL, their presence is specified by each mode and
   Profile.  The Compressed Bitmap field MUST be present in SCHC F/R
   modes that use windows, and MUST NOT be present in other modes.

  |---- SCHC ACK Header ----|
            |-- T --|-M-| 1 |
  +--- ... -+- ... -+---+---+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  | Rule ID |  DTag | W |C=1| padding as needed                (success)
  +--- ... -+- ... -+---+---+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  +--- ... -+- ... -+---+---+------ ... ------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  | Rule ID |  DTag | W |C=0|Compressed Bitmap| pad. as needed (failure)
  +--- ... -+- ... -+---+---+------ ... ------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


                 Figure 15: Format of the SCHC ACK message

   The SCHC ACK Header contains a C bit (see Section 8.2.4).

   If the C bit is set to 1 (integrity check successful), no Bitmap is
   carried.

   If the C bit is set to 0 (integrity check not performed or failed)
   and if windows are used, a Compressed Bitmap for the window referred
   to by the W field is transmitted as specified in Section 8.3.2.1.

8.3.2.1.  Bitmap Compression

   For transmission, the Compressed Bitmap in the SCHC ACK message is
   defined by the following algorithm (see Figure 16 for a follow-along
   example):

   o  Build a temporary SCHC ACK message that contains the Header
      followed by the original Bitmap (see Section 8.2.2.3 for a
      description of Bitmaps).

   o  Position scissors at the end of the Bitmap, after its last bit.

   o  While the bit on the left of the scissors is 1 and belongs to the
      Bitmap, keep moving left, then stop.  When this is done,




Minaburo, et al.          Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 30]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   o  While the scissors are not on an L2 Word boundary of the SCHC ACK
      message and there is a Bitmap bit on the right of the scissors,
      keep moving right, then stop.

   o  At this point, cut and drop off any bits to the right of the
      scissors

   When one or more bits have effectively been dropped off as a result
   of the above algorithm, the SCHC ACK message is a multiple of L2
   Words, no padding bits will be appended.

   Because the SCHC Fragment sender knows the size of the original
   Bitmap, it can reconstruct the original Bitmap from the Compressed
   Bitmap received in the SCH ACK message.

   Figure 16 shows an example where L2 Words are actually bytes and
   where the original Bitmap contains 17 bits, the last 15 of which are
   all set to 1.

   |---- SCHC ACK Header ----|--------      Bitmap     --------|

   from 6 down to 0, where the Bitmap indicates that the second and the
   fourth tile of the window have not been correctly received.

8.3.3.  SCHC ACK REQ format

   The SCHC ACK REQ is used by a sender to request a SCHC ACK from the
   receiver.  Its format is shown in Figure 20.  The DTag field and the
   W field are OPTIONAL, their presence is specified by each mode and
   Profile.  The FCN field is all zero.

8.3.4.  SCHC Sender-Abort format

   When a SCHC Fragment sender needs to abort an on-going fragmented
   SCHC Packet transmission, it sends a SCHC Sender-Abort message to the
   SCHC Fragment receiver.

   The SCHC Sender-Abort format is shown in Figure 21.  The DTag field
   and the W field are OPTIONAL, their presence is specified by each
   mode and Profile.  The FCN field is all ones.

   |---- Sender-Abort Header ----|
             |-- T --|-M-|-- N --|
   +-- ... --+- ... -+---+- ... -+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   | Rule ID | DTag  | W | 11..1 | padding (as needed)
   +-- ... --+- ... -+---+- ... -+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                    Figure 21: SCHC Sender-Abort format

   If the W field is present,

   o  the fragment sender MUST set it to all ones.  Other values are
      RESERVED.

   o  the fragment receiver MUST check its value.  If the value is
      different from all ones, the message MUST be ignored.

   The SCHC Sender-Abort MUST NOT be acknowledged.

8.3.5.  SCHC Receiver-Abort format

   When a SCHC Fragment receiver needs to abort an on-going fragmented
   SCHC Packet transmission, it transmits a SCHC Receiver-Abort message
   to the SCHC Fragment sender.

   The SCHC Receiver-Abort format is shown in Figure 22.  The DTag field
   and the W field are OPTIONAL, their presence is specified by each
   mode and Profile.

   |--- Receiver-Abort Header ---|
               |--- T ---|-M-| 1 |
   +--- ... ---+-- ... --+---+---+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

               next L2 Word boundary ->|<-- L2 Word -->|

                   Figure 22: SCHC Receiver-Abort format

   If the W field is present,



Minaburo, et al.          Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 33]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   o  the fragment receiver MUST set it to all ones.  Other values are
      RESERVED.

   o  if the value is different from all ones, the fragment sender MUST
      ignore the message.

   The SCHC Receiver-Abort has the same header as a SCHC ACK message.
   The bits that follow the SCHC Receiver-Abort Header MUST be as
   follows

   o  if the Header does not end at an L2 Word boundary, append bits set
      to 1 as needed to reach the next L2 Word boundary

   o  append exactly one more L2 Word with bits all set to ones

   Such a bit pattern never occurs in a legitimate SCHC ACK.  This is
   how the fragment sender recognizes a SCHC Receiver-Abort.

   The SCHC Receiver-Abort MUST NOT be acknowledged.

8.4.  SCHC F/R modes

   This specification includes several SCHC F/R modes, which

   o  allow for a range of reliability options, such as optional SCHC
      Fragment retransmission

   o  support various LPWAN characteristics, such as links with variable
      MTU or unidirectional links.

   More modes may be defined in the future.

   Appendix B provides examples of fragmentation sessions based on the
   modes described hereafter.

   Appendix C provides examples of Finite State Machines implementing
   the SCHC F/R modes described hereafter.

8.4.1.  No-ACK mode

   The No-ACK mode has been designed under the assumption that data unit
   out-of-sequence delivery does not occur between the entity performing
   fragmentation and the entity performing reassembly.  This mode
   supports LPWAN technologies that have a variable MTU.

   In No-ACK mode, there is no communication from the fragment receiver
   to the fragment sender.  The sender transmits all the SCHC Fragments




Minaburo, et al.          Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 34]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   without expecting any acknowledgement.  Therefore, No-ACK does not
   require bidirectional links: unidirectional links are just fine.

   In No-ACK mode, only the All-1 SCHC Fragment is padded as needed.
   The other SCHC Fragments are intrinsically aligned to L2 Words.

   The tile sizes are not required to be uniform.  Windows are not used.
   The Retransmission Timer is not used.  The Attempts counter is not
   used.

   Each Profile MUST specify which Rule ID value(s) correspond to SCHC
   F/R messages operating in this mode.

   The W field MUST NOT be present in the SCHC F/R messages.  SCHC ACK
   MUST NOT be sent.  SCHC ACK REQ MUST NOT be sent.  SCHC Sender-Abort
   MAY be sent.  SCHC Receiver-Abort MUST NOT be sent.

   The value of N (size of the FCN field) is RECOMMENDED to be 1.

   Each Profile, for each Rule ID value, MUST define

   o  the size of the DTag field,

   o  the size and algorithm for the RCS field,

   o  the expiration time of the Inactivity Timer

   Each Profile, for each Rule ID value, MAY define

   o  a value of N different from the recommended one,

   o  the meaning of values sent in the FCN field, for values different
      from the All-1 value.

   For each active pair of Rule ID and DTag values, the receiver MUST
   maintain an Inactivity Timer.  If the receiver is under-resourced to
   do this, it MUST silently drop the related messages.

8.4.1.1.  Sender behavior

   At the beginning of the fragmentation of a new SCHC Packet, the
   fragment sender MUST select a Rule ID and DTag value pair for this
   SCHC Packet.

   Each SCHC Fragment MUST contain exactly one tile in its Payload.  The
   tile MUST be at least the size of an L2 Word.  The sender MUST
   transmit the SCHC Fragments messages in the order that the tiles
   appear in the SCHC Packet.  Except for the last tile of a SCHC

   Packet, each tile MUST be of a size that complements the SCHC
   Fragment Header so that the SCHC Fragment is a multiple of L2 Words
   without the need for padding bits.  Except for the last one, the SCHC
   Fragments MUST use the Regular SCHC Fragment format specified in
   Section 8.3.1.1.  The SCHC Fragment that carries the last tile MUST
   be an All-1 SCHC Fragment, described in Section 8.3.1.2.

   The sender MAY transmit a SCHC Sender-Abort.

   Figure 37 shows an example of a corresponding state machine.

8.4.1.2.  Receiver behavior

   Upon receiving each Regular SCHC Fragment,

   o  the receiver MUST reset the Inactivity Timer,

   o  the receiver assembles the payloads of the SCHC Fragments

   On receiving an All-1 SCHC Fragment,

   o  the receiver MUST append the All-1 SCHC Fragment Payload and the
      padding bits to the previously received SCHC Fragment Payloads for
      this SCHC Packet

   o  the receiver MUST perform the integrity check

   o  if integrity checking fails, the receiver MUST drop the
      reassembled SCHC Packet

   o  the reassembly operation concludes.

   On expiration of the Inactivity Timer, the receiver MUST drop the
   SCHC Packet being reassembled.

   On receiving a SCHC Sender-Abort, the receiver MAY drop the SCHC
   Packet being reassembled.

   Figure 38 shows an example of a corresponding state machine.

8.4.2.  ACK-Always mode

   The ACK-Always mode has been designed under the following assumptions

   o  Data unit out-of-sequence delivery does not occur between the
      entity performing fragmentation and the entity performing
      reassembly




Minaburo, et al.          Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 36]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   o  The L2 MTU value does not change while the fragments of a SCHC
      Packet are being transmitted.

   o  There is a feedback path from the reassembler to the fragmenter.
      See Appendix F for a discussion on using ACK-Always mode on quasi-
      bidirectional links.

   In ACK-Always mode, windows are used.  An acknowledgement, positive
   or negative, is transmitted by the fragment receiver to the fragment
   sender at the end of the transmission of each window of SCHC
   Fragments.

   The tiles are not required to be of uniform size.  In ACK-Always
   mode, only the All-1 SCHC Fragment is padded as needed.  The other
   SCHC Fragments are intrinsically aligned to L2 Words.

   Briefly, the algorithm is as follows: after a first blind
   transmission of all the tiles of a window, the fragment sender
   iterates retransmitting the tiles that are reported missing until the
   fragment receiver reports that all the tiles belonging to the window
   have been correctly received, or until too many attempts were made.
   The fragment sender only advances to the next window of tiles when it
   has ascertained that all the tiles belonging to the current window
   have been fully and correctly received.  This results in a per-window
   lock-step behavior between the sender and the receiver.

   Each Profile MUST specify which Rule ID value(s) correspond to SCHC
   F/R messages operating in this mode.

   The W field MUST be present and its size M MUST be 1 bit.

   Each Profile, for each Rule ID value, MUST define

   o  the value of N (size of the FCN field),

   o  the value of WINDOW_SIZE, which MUST be strictly less than 2^N,

   o  the size and algorithm for the RCS field,

   o  the size of the DTag field,

   o  the value of MAX_ACK_REQUESTS,

   o  the expiration time of the Retransmission Timer

   o  the expiration time of the Inactivity Timer

   For each active pair of Rule ID and DTag values, the sender MUST
   maintain

   o  one Attempts counter

   o  one Retransmission Timer

   For each active pair of Rule ID and DTag values, the receiver MUST
   maintain

   o  one Inactivity Timer

   o  one Attempts counter

8.4.2.1.  Sender behavior

   At the beginning of the fragmentation of a new SCHC Packet, the
   fragment sender MUST select a Rule ID and DTag value pair for this
   SCHC Packet.

   Each SCHC Fragment MUST contain exactly one tile in its Payload.  All
   tiles with the index 0, as well as the last tile, MUST be at least
   the size of an L2 Word.

   In all SCHC Fragment messages, the W field MUST be filled with the
   least significant bit of the window number that the sender is
   currently processing.

   For a SCHC Fragment that carries a tile other than the last one of
   the SCHC Packet,

   o  the Fragment MUST be of the Regular type specified in
      Section 8.3.1.1

   o  the FCN field MUST contain the tile index

   o  each tile MUST be of a size that complements the SCHC Fragment
      Header so that the SCHC Fragment is a multiple of L2 Words without
      the need for padding bits.

   The SCHC Fragment that carries the last tile MUST be an All-1 SCHC
   Fragment, described in Section 8.3.1.2.

   The fragment sender MUST start by transmitting the window numbered 0.

   All message receptions being discussed in the rest of this section
   are to be understood as "matching the RuleID and DTag pair being
   processed", even if not spelled out, for brevity.

   The sender starts by a "blind transmission" phase, in which it MUST
   transmit all the tiles composing the window, in decreasing tile index
   order.

   Then, it enters a "retransmission phase" in which it MUST initialize
   an Attempts counter to 0, it MUST start a Retransmission Timer and it
   MUST await a SCHC ACK.  Then,

   o  upon receiving a SCHC ACK,

      *  if the SCHC ACK indicates that some tiles are missing at the
         receiver, then the sender MUST transmit all the tiles that have
         been reported missing, it MUST increment Attempts, it MUST
         reset the Retransmission Timer and MUST await the next SCHC
         ACK.

      *  if the current window is not the last one and the SCHC ACK
         indicates that all tiles were correctly received, the sender
         MUST stop the Retransmission Timer, it MUST advance to the next
         fragmentation window and it MUST start a blind transmission
         phase as described above.

      *  if the current window is the last one and the SCHC ACK
         indicates that more tiles were received than the sender sent,
         the fragment sender MUST send a SCHC Sender-Abort, and it MAY
         exit with an error condition.

      *  if the current window is the last one and the SCHC ACK
         indicates that all tiles were correctly received yet integrity
         check was a failure, the fragment sender MUST send a SCHC
         Sender-Abort, and it MAY exit with an error condition.

      *  if the current window is the last one and the SCHC ACK
         indicates that integrity checking was successful, the sender
         exits successfully.

   o  on Retransmission Timer expiration,

      *  if Attempts is strictly less that MAX_ACK_REQUESTS, the
         fragment sender MUST send a SCHC ACK REQ and MUST increment the
         Attempts counter.

      *  otherwise the fragment sender MUST send a SCHC Sender-Abort,
         and it MAY exit with an error condition.

   o  on receiving a SCHC Receiver-Abort, the fragment sender MAY exit
      with an error condition.

   o  on receiving a SCHC ACK that bears a W value different from the W
      value that it currently uses, the fragment sender MUST silently
      discard and ignore that SCHC ACK.

8.4.2.2.  Receiver behavior

   On receiving a SCHC Fragment with a Rule ID and DTag pair not being
   processed at that time

   o  the receiver SHOULD check if the DTag value has not recently been
      used for that Rule ID value, thereby ensuring that the received
      SCHC Fragment is not a remnant of a prior fragmented SCHC Packet

8.4.3.  ACK-on-Error mode

   MTU and out-of-order delivery.  It operates with links that provide a
   feedback path from the reassembler to the fragmenter.  See Appendix F
   for a discussion on using ACK-on-Error mode on quasi-bidirectional
   links.

   In ACK-on-Error mode, windows are used.

   All tiles, but the last one and the penultimate one, MUST be of equal
   size, hereafter called "regular".  The size of the last tile MUST be
   smaller than or equal to the regular tile size.  Regarding the
   penultimate tile, a Profile MUST pick one of the following two
   options:

   o  The penultimate tile size MUST be the regular tile size

   o  or the penultimate tile size MUST be either the regular tile size
      or the regular tile size minus one L2 Word.

   A SCHC Fragment message carries one or several contiguous tiles,
   which may span multiple windows.  A SCHC ACK reports on the reception
   of exactly one window of tiles.

      Figure 23: a SCHC Packet fragmented in tiles, ACK-on-Error mode

   The W field is wide enough that it unambiguously represents an
   absolute window number.  The fragment receiver sends SCHC ACKs to the
   fragment sender about windows for which tiles are missing.  No SCHC
   ACK is sent by the fragment receiver for windows that it knows have
   been fully received.

   The fragment sender retransmits SCHC Fragments for tiles that are
   reported missing.  It can advance to next windows even before it has
   ascertained that all tiles belonging to previous windows have been
   correctly received, and can still later retransmit SCHC Fragments
   with tiles belonging to previous windows.  Therefore, the sender and
   the receiver may operate in a decoupled fashion.  The fragmented SCHC
   Packet transmission concludes when

   o  integrity checking shows that the fragmented SCHC Packet has been
      correctly reassembled at the receive end, and this information has
      been conveyed back to the sender,

   o  or too many retransmission attempts were made,

      fragmented SCHC Packet has been inactive for too long.

   Each Profile MUST specify which Rule ID value(s) correspond to SCHC
   F/R messages operating in this mode.

   The W field MUST be present in the SCHC F/R messages.

   Each Profile, for each Rule ID value, MUST define

   o  the tile size (a tile does not need to be multiple of an L2 Word,
      but it MUST be at least the size of an L2 Word)

   o  the value of M (size of the W field),

   o  the value of N (size of the FCN field),

   o  the value of WINDOW_SIZE, which MUST be strictly less than 2^N,

8.4.3.1.  Sender behavior

   At the beginning of the fragmentation of a new SCHC Packet,

   o  the fragment sender MUST select a Rule ID and DTag value pair for
      this SCHC Packet.  A Rule MUST NOT be selected if the values of M
      and WINDOW_SIZE for that Rule are such that the SCHC Packet cannot
      be fragmented in (2^M) * WINDOW_SIZE tiles or less.

   o  the fragment sender MUST initialize the Attempts counter to 0 for
      that Rule ID and DTag value pair.

   A Regular SCHC Fragment message carries in its payload one or more
   tiles.  If more than one tile is carried in one Regular SCHC Fragment

   o  the selected tiles MUST be contiguous in the original SCHC Packet

   o  they MUST be placed in the SCHC Fragment Payload adjacent to one
      another, in the order they appear in the SCHC Packet, from the
      start of the SCHC Packet toward its end.

   Tiles that are not the last one MUST be sent in Regular SCHC
   Fragments specified in Section 8.3.1.1.  The FCN field MUST contain
   the tile index of the first tile sent in that SCHC Fragment.

   In a Regular SCHC Fragment message, the sender MUST fill the W field
   with the window number of the first tile sent in that SCHC Fragment.

   Depending on the Profile, the last tile of a SCHC Packet MUST be sent
   either

   o  in a Regular SCHC Fragment, alone or as part of a multi-tiles
      Payload

   o  alone in an All-1 SCHC Fragment

   In an All-1 SCHC Fragment message, the sender MUST fill the W field
   with the window number of the last tile of the SCHC Packet.

   The fragment sender MUST send SCHC Fragments such that, all together,
   they contain all the tiles of the fragmented SCHC Packet.

   The fragment sender MUST send at least one All-1 SCHC Fragment.

   The fragment sender MUST listen for SCHC ACK messages after having
   sent

   o  an All-1 SCHC Fragment

   o  or a SCHC ACK REQ.

   A Profile MAY specify other times at which the fragment sender MUST
   listen for SCHC ACK messages.  For example, this could be after
   sending a complete window of tiles.

   Each time a fragment sender sends an All-1 SCHC Fragment or a SCHC
   ACK REQ,

   o  it MUST increment the Attempts counter

   o  it MUST reset the Retransmission Timer

   On Retransmission Timer expiration

   o  if Attempts is strictly less than MAX_ACK_REQUESTS, the fragment
      sender MUST send either the All-1 SCHC Fragment or a SCHC ACK REQ
      with the W field corresponding to the last window,

      MAY exit with an error condition.

   All message receptions being discussed in the rest of this section
   are to be understood as "matching the RuleID and DTag pair being
   processed", even if not spelled out, for brevity.

      SCHC Fragment is not a remnant of a prior fragmented SCHC Packet
      transmission.  The initial value of the Inactivity Timer is the

      SCHC Fragment is determined to be such a remnant, the receiver MAY
      silently ignore it and discard it.

   o  the receiver MUST start a process to assemble a new SCHC Packet
      with that Rule ID and DTag value pair.  The receiver MUST start an
      Inactivity Timer for that Rule ID and DTag value pair.  It MUST
      initialize an Attempts counter to 0 for that Rule ID and DTag
      value pair.  If the receiver is under-resourced to do this, it
      MUST respond to the sender with a SCHC Receiver Abort.

   On reception of any SCHC F/R message for the RuleID and DTag pair
   being processed, the receiver MUST reset the Inactivity Timer
   pertaining to that RuleID and DTag pair.

   All message receptions being discussed in the rest of this section
   are to be understood as "matching the RuleID and DTag pair being
   processed", even if not spelled out, for brevity.

   On receiving a SCHC Fragment message, the receiver determines what
   tiles were received, based on the payload length and on the W and FCN
   fields of the SCHC Fragment.

   o  if the FCN is All-1, if a Payload is present, the full SCHC
      Fragment Payload MUST be assembled including the padding bits.
      This is because the size of the last tile is not known by the
      receiver, therefore padding bits are indistinguishable from the
      tile data bits, at this stage.  They will be removed by the SCHC
      C/D sublayer.  If the size of the SCHC Fragment Payload exceeds or
      equals the size of one regular tile plus the size of an L2 Word,
      this SHOULD raise an error flag.

   o  otherwise, tiles MUST be assembled based on the a priori known
      tile size.

      *  If allowed by the Profile, the end of the payload MAY contain
         the last tile, which may be shorter.  Padding bits are
         indistinguishable from the tile data bits, at this stage.

      *  the payload may contain the penultimate tile that, if allowed
         by the Profile, MAY be exactly one L2 Word shorter than the
         regular tile size.

      *  Otherwise, padding bits MUST be discarded.  The latter is
         possible because

         +  the size of the tiles is known a priori,

         +  tiles are larger than an L2 Word

         +  padding bits are always strictly less than an L2 Word

   On receiving a SCHC ACK REQ or an All-1 SCHC Fragment,

   o  if the receiver knows of any windows with missing tiles for the
      packet being reassembled, it MUST return a SCHC ACK for the
      lowest-numbered such window,

   o  otherwise,

      *  if it has received at least one tile, it MUST return a SCHC ACK
         for the highest-numbered window it currently has tiles for

      *  otherwise it MUST return a SCHC ACK for window numbered 0

   A Profile MAY specify other times and circumstances at which a
   receiver sends a SCHC ACK, and which window the SCHC ACK reports
   about in these circumstances.

   Upon sending a SCHC ACK, the receiver MUST increase the Attempts
   counter.

   After receiving an All-1 SCHC Fragment, a receiver MUST check the
   integrity of the reassembled SCHC Packet at least every time it
   prepares for sending a SCHC ACK for the last window.

   Upon receiving a SCHC Sender-Abort, the receiver MAY exit with an
   error condition.

   Upon expiration of the Inactivity Timer, the receiver MUST send a
   SCHC Receiver-Abort and it MAY exit with an error condition.

   On the Attempts counter exceeding MAX_ACK_REQUESTS, the receiver MUST
   send a SCHC Receiver-Abort and it MAY exit with an error condition.

   Reassembly of the SCHC Packet concludes when

   o  a Sender-Abort has been received

   o  or the Inactivity Timer has expired

   o  or the Attempts counter has exceeded MAX_ACK_REQUESTS

   o  or when at least an All-1 SCHC Fragment has been received and
      integrity checking of the reassembled SCHC Packet is successful.

9.  Padding management

   SCHC C/D and SCHC F/R operate on bits, not bytes.  SCHC itself does
   not have any alignment prerequisite.  The size of SCHC Packets can be
   any number of bits.

   If the layer below SCHC constrains the payload to align to some
   boundary, called L2 Words (for example, bytes), the SCHC messages
   MUST be padded.  When padding occurs, the number of appended bits
   MUST be strictly less than the L2 Word size.

   If a SCHC Packet is sent unfragmented (see Figure 24), it is padded
   as needed for transmission.

   If a SCHC Packet needs to be fragmented for transmission, it is not
   padded in itself.  Only the SCHC F/R messages are padded as needed
   for transmission.  Some SCHC F/R messages are intrinsically aligned
   to L2 Words.

   value is 0.

10.  SCHC Compression for IPv6 and UDP headers

   This section lists the IPv6 and UDP header fields and describes how
   they can be compressed.  An example of a set of Rules for UDP/IPv6
   header compression is provided in Appendix A.

10.1.  IPv6 version field

   The IPv6 version field is labeled by the protocol parser as being the
   "version" field of the IPv6 protocol.  Therefore, it only exists for
   IPv6 packets.  In the Rule, TV is set to 6, MO to "ignore" and CDA to
   "not-sent".

10.2.  IPv6 Traffic class field

   If the DiffServ field does not vary and is known by both sides, the
   Field Descriptor in the Rule SHOULD contain a TV with this well-known
   value, an "equal" MO and a "not-sent" CDA.

   Otherwise (e.g., ECN bits are to be transmitted), two possibilities
   can be considered depending on the variability of the value:

   o  One possibility is to not compress the field and send the original
      value.  In the Rule, TV is not set to any particular value, MO is
      set to "ignore" and CDA is set to "value-sent".

   o  If some upper bits in the field are constant and known, a better
      option is to only send the LSBs.  In the Rule, TV is set to a
      value with the stable known upper part, MO is set to MSB(x) and
      CDA to LSB.

      ECN functionality depends on both bits of the ECN field, which are
      the 2 LSBs of this field, hence sending only a single LSB of this
      field is NOT RECOMMENDED.

10.3.  Flow label field

   If the flow label is not set, i.e. its value is zero, the Field
   Descriptor in the Rule SHOULD contain a TV set to zero, an "equal" MO
   and a "not-sent" CDA.

   If the flow label is set to a pseudo-random value according to
   [RFC6437], in the Rule, TV is not set to any particular value, MO is
   set to "ignore" and CDA is set to "value-sent".




Minaburo, et al.          Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 52]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   If the flow label is set according to some prior agreement, i.e. by a
   flow state establishment method as allowed by [RFC6437], the Field
   Descriptor in the Rule SHOULD contain a TV with this agreed-upon
   value, an "equal" MO and a "not-sent" CDA.

10.4.  Payload Length field

   This field can be elided for the transmission on the LPWAN network.
   The SCHC C/D recomputes the original payload length value.  In the
   Field Descriptor, TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore" and CDA is
   "compute-*".

10.5.  Next Header field

   If the Next Header field does not vary and is known by both sides,
   the Field Descriptor in the Rule SHOULD contain a TV with this Next
   Header value, the MO SHOULD be "equal" and the CDA SHOULD be "not-
   sent".

   Otherwise, TV is not set in the Field Descriptor, MO is set to
   "ignore" and CDA is set to "value-sent".  Alternatively, a matching-
   list MAY also be used.

10.6.  Hop Limit field

   The field behavior for this field is different for uplink (Up) and
   downlink (Dw).  In Up, since there is no IP forwarding between the
   Dev and the SCHC C/D, the value is relatively constant.  On the other
   hand, the Dw value depends on Internet routing and can change more
   frequently.  The Direction Indicator (DI) can be used to distinguish
   both directions:

   o  in the Up, elide the field: the TV in the Field Descriptor is set
      to the known constant value, the MO is set to "equal" and the CDA
      is set to "not-sent".

   o  in the Dw, the Hop Limit is elided for transmission and forced to
      1 at the receiver, by setting TV to 1, MO to "ignore" and CDA to
      "not-sent".  This prevents any further forwarding.

10.7.  IPv6 addresses fields

   As in 6LoWPAN [RFC4944], IPv6 addresses are split into two 64-bit
   long fields; one for the prefix and one for the Interface Identifier
   (IID).  These fields SHOULD be compressed.  To allow for a single
   Rule being used for both directions, these values are identified by
   their role (Dev or App) and not by their position in the header
   (source or destination).

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


10.7.1.  IPv6 source and destination prefixes

   Both ends MUST be configured with the appropriate prefixes.  For a
   specific flow, the source and destination prefixes can be unique and
   stored in the Context.  In that case, the TV for the source and
   destination prefixes contain the values, the MO is set to "equal" and
   the CDA is set to "not-sent".

   If the Rule is intended to compress packets with different prefix
   values, match-mapping SHOULD be used.  The different prefixes are
   listed in the TV, the MO is set to "match-mapping" and the CDA is set
   to "mapping-sent".  See Figure 26.

   Otherwise, the TV is not set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA
   is set to "value-sent".

10.7.2.  IPv6 source and destination IID

   If the Dev or App IID are based on an LPWAN address, then the IID can
   be reconstructed with information coming from the LPWAN header.  In
   that case, the TV is not set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA
   is set to "DevIID" or "AppIID".  On LPWAN technologies where the
   frames carry a single identifier (corresponding to the Dev.), AppIID
   cannot be used.

   As described in [RFC8065], it may be undesirable to build the Dev
   IPv6 IID out of the Dev address.  Another static value is used
   instead.  In that case, the TV contains the static value, the MO
   operator is set to "equal" and the CDA is set to "not-sent".

   If several IIDs are possible, then the TV contains the list of
   possible IIDs, the MO is set to "match-mapping" and the CDA is set to
   "mapping-sent".

   It may also happen that the IID variability only expresses itself on
   a few bytes.  In that case, the TV is set to the stable part of the
   IID, the MO is set to "MSB" and the CDA is set to "LSB".

   Finally, the IID can be sent in its entirety on the LPWAN.  In that
   case, the TV is not set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA is set
   to "value-sent".

10.8.  IPv6 extension headers

   This document does not provide recommendations on how to compress
   IPv6 extension headers.

10.9.  UDP source and destination ports

   To allow for a single Rule being used for both directions, the UDP
   port values are identified by their role (Dev or App) and not by
   their position in the header (source or destination).  The SCHC C/D
   MUST be aware of the traffic direction (Uplink, Downlink) to select
   the appropriate field.  The following Rules apply for Dev and App
   port numbers.

   If both ends know the port number, it can be elided.  The TV contains
   the port number, the MO is set to "equal" and the CDA is set to "not-
   sent".

   If the port variation is on few bits, the TV contains the stable part
   of the port number, the MO is set to "MSB" and the CDA is set to
   "LSB".

   If some well-known values are used, the TV can contain the list of
   these values, the MO is set to "match-mapping" and the CDA is set to
   "mapping-sent".

   Otherwise the port numbers are sent over the LPWAN.  The TV is not
   set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA is set to "value-sent".

10.10.  UDP length field

   The UDP length can be computed from the received data.  The TV is not
   set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA is set to "compute-*".

10.11.  UDP Checksum field

   The UDP checksum operation is mandatory with IPv6 for most packets
   but there are exceptions [RFC8200].

   For instance, protocols that use UDP as a tunnel encapsulation may
   enable zero-checksum mode for a specific port (or set of ports) for
   sending and/or receiving.  [RFC8200] requires any node implementing
   zero-checksum mode to follow the requirements specified in
   "Applicability Statement for the Use of IPv6 UDP Datagrams with Zero
   Checksums" [RFC6936].

   6LoWPAN Header Compression [RFC6282] also specifies that a UDP
   checksum can be elided by the compressor and re-computed by the
   decompressor when an upper layer guarantees the integrity of the UDP
   payload and pseudo-header.  A specific example of this is when a
   message integrity check protects the compressed message between the
   compressor that elides the UDP checksum and the decompressor that




Minaburo, et al.          Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 55]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   computes it, with a strength that is identical or better to the UDP
   checksum.

   Similarly, a SCHC compressor MAY elide the UDP checksum when another
   layer guarantees at least equal integrity protection for the UDP
   payload and the pseudo-header.  In this case, the TV is not set, the
   MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA is set to "compute-*".

   In particular, when SCHC fragmentation is used, a fragmentation RCS
   of 2 bytes or more provides equal or better protection than the UDP
   checksum; in that case, if the compressor is collocated with the
   fragmentation point and the decompressor is collocated with the
   packet reassembly point, and if the SCHC Packet is fragmented even
   when it would fit unfragmented in the L2 MTU, then the compressor MAY
   verify and then elide the UDP checksum.  Whether and when the UDP
   Checksum is elided is to be specified in the Profile.

   Since the compression happens before the fragmentation, implementers
   should understand the risks when dealing with unprotected data below
   the transport layer and take special care when manipulating that
   data.

   In other cases, the checksum SHOULD be explicitly sent.  The TV is
   not set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA is set to "value-
   sent".

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no request to IANA.

12.  Security considerations

   As explained in Section 5, SCHC is expected to be implemented on top
   of LPWAN technologies, which are expected to implement security
   measures.

   In this section, we analyze the potential security threats that could
   be introduced into an LPWAN by adding the SCHC functionalities.

12.1.  Security considerations for SCHC Compression/Decompression

12.1.1.  Forged SCHC Packet

   Let's assume that an attacker is able to send a forged SCHC Packet to
   a SCHC Decompressor.

   Let's first consider the case where the Rule ID contained in that
   forged SCHC Packet does not correspond to a Rule allocated in the



Minaburo, et al.          Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 56]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   Rule table.  An implementation should detect that the Rule ID is
   invalid and should silently drop the offending SCHC Packet.

   Let's now consider that the Rule ID corresponds to a Rule in the
   table.  With the CDAs defined in this document, the reconstructed
   packet is at most a constant number of bits bigger than the SCHC
   Packet that was received.  This assumes that the compute-*
   decompression actions produce a bounded number of bits, irrespective
   of the incoming SCHC Packet.  This property is true for IPv6 Length,
   UDP Length and UDP Checksum, for which the compute-* CDA is
   recommended by this document.

   As a consequence, SCHC Decompression does not amplify attacks, beyond
   adding a bounded number of bits to the SCHC Packet received.  This
   bound is determined by the Rule stored in the receiving device.

   As a general safety measure, a SCHC Decompressor should never re-
   construct a packet larger than MAX_PACKET_SIZE (defined in a Profile,
   with 1500 bytes as generic default).

12.1.2.  Compressed packet size as a side channel to guess a secret
         token

   Some packet compression methods are known to be susceptible to
   attacks, such as BREACH and CRIME.  The attack involves injecting
   arbitrary data into the packet and observing the resulting compressed
   packet size.  The observed size potentially reflects correlation
   between the arbitrary data and some content that was meant to remain
   secret, such as a security token, thereby allowing the attacker to
   get at the secret.

   By contrast, SCHC Compression takes place header field by header
   field, with the SCHC Packet being a mere concatenation of the
   compression residues of each of the individual field.  Any
   correlation between header fields does not result in a change in the
   SCHC Packet size compressed under the same Rule.

   If SCHC C/D is used to compress packets that include a secret
   information field, such as a token, the Rule set should be designed
   so that the size of the compression residue for the field to remain
   secret is the same irrespective of the value of the secret
   information.  This is achieved by e.g., sending this field in extenso
   with the "ignore" MO and the "value-sent" CDA.  This recommendation
   is disputable if it is ascertained that the Rule set itself will
   remain secret.

12.1.3.  Decompressed packet different from the original packet

   As explained in Section 7.3, using FPs with value 0 in Field
   Descriptors in a Rule may result in header fields appearing in the
   decompressed packet in an order different from that in the original
   packet.  Likewise, as stated in Section 7.5.3, using an "ignore" MO
   together with a "not-sent" CDA will result in the header field taking
   the TV value, which is likely to be different from the original
   value.

   Depending on the protocol, the order of header fields in the packet
   may be functionally significant or not.

   Furthermore, if the packet is protected by a checksum or a similar
   integrity protection mechanism, and if the checksum is transmitted
   instead of being recomputed as part of the decompression, these
   situations may result in the packet being considered corrupt and
   dropped.

12.2.  Security considerations for SCHC Fragmentation/Reassembly

12.2.1.  Buffer reservation attack

   Let's assume that an attacker is able to send a forged SCHC Fragment
   to a SCHC Reassembler.

   A node can perform a buffer reservation attack: the receiver will
   reserve buffer space for the SCHC Packet.  If the implementation has
   only one buffer, other incoming fragmented SCHC Packets will be
   dropped while the reassembly buffer is occupied during the reassembly
   timeout.  Once that timeout expires, the attacker can repeat the same
   procedure, and iterate, thus creating a denial of service attack.  An
   implementation may have multiple reassembly buffers.  The cost to
   mount this attack is linear with the number of buffers at the target
   node.  Better, the cost for an attacker can be increased if
   individual fragments of multiple SCHC Packets can be stored in the
   reassembly buffer.  The finer grained the reassembly buffer (downto
   the smallest tile size), the higher the cost of the attack.  If
   buffer overload does occur, a smart receiver could selectively
   discard SCHC Packets being reassembled based on the sender behavior,
   which may help identify which SCHC Fragments have been sent by the
   attacker.  Another mild counter-measure is for the target to abort
   the fragmentation/reassembly session as early as it detects a non-
   identical SCHC Fragment duplicate, anticipating for an eventual
   corrupt SCHC Packet, so as to save the sender the hassle of sending
   the rest of the fragments for this SCHC Packet.

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


12.2.2.  Corrupt Fragment attack

   Let's assume that an attacker is able to send a forged SCHC Fragment
   to a SCHC Reassembler.  The malicious node is additionally assumed to
   be able to hear an incoming communication destined to the target
   node.

   It can then send a forged SCHC Fragment that looks like it belongs to
   a SCHC Packet already being reassembled at the target node.  This can
   cause the SCHC Packet to be considered corrupt and be dropped by the
   receiver.  The amplification happens here by a single spoofed SCHC
   Fragment rendering a full sequence of legit SCHC Fragments useless.
   If the target uses ACK-Always or ACK-on-Error mode, such a malicious
   node can also interfere with the acknowledgement and repetition
   algorithm of SCHC F/R.  A single spoofed ACK, with all bitmap bits
   set to 0, will trigger the repetition of WINDOW_SIZE tiles.  This
   protocol loop amplification depletes the energy source of the target
   node and consumes the channel bandwidth.  Similarly, a spoofed ACK
   REQ will trigger the sending of a SCHC ACK, which may be much larger
   than the ACK REQ if WINDOW_SIZE is large.  These consequences should
   be borne in mind when defining profiles for SCHC over specific LPWAN
   technologies.

12.2.3.  Fragmentation as a way to bypass Network Inspection

   Fragmentation is known for potentially allowing to force through a
   Network Inspection device (e.g., firewall) packets that would be
   rejected if unfragmented.  This involves sending overlapping
   fragments to rewrite fields whose initial value led the Network
   Inspection device to allow the flow go through.

   SCHC F/R is expected to be used over one LPWAN link, where no Network
   Inspection device is expected to sit.  As described in Section 5.2,
   even if the SCHC F/R on the Network infrastructure side is located in
   the Internet, a tunnel is to be established between it and the NGW.

12.2.4.  Privacy issues associated with SCHC header fields

   SCHC F/R allocates a DTag value to fragments belonging to the same
   SCHC Packet.  Concerns were raised that, if DTag is a wide counter
   that is incremented in a predictable fashion for each new fragmented
   SCHC Packet, it might lead to a privacy issue, such as enabling
   tracking of a device across LPWANs.

   However, SCHC F/R is expected to be used over exactly one LPWAN link.
   As described in Section 5.2, even if the SCHC F/R on the Network
   infrastructure side is located in the Internet, a tunnel is to be
   established between it and the NGW.  Therefore, assuming the tunnel

   provides confidentiality, neither the DTag field nor any other SCHC-
   introduced field is visible over the Internet.

Appendix A.  Compression Examples

   This section gives some scenarios of the compression mechanism for
   IPv6/UDP.  The goal is to illustrate the behavior of SCHC.

   The mechanisms defined in this document can be applied to a Dev that
   embeds some applications running over CoAP.  In this example, three
   flows are considered.  The first flow is for the device management
   based on CoAP using Link Local IPv6 addresses and UDP ports 123 and
   124 for Dev and App, respectively.  The second flow will be a CoAP

   server for measurements done by the Dev (using ports 5683) and Global
   IPv6 Address prefixes alpha::IID/64 to beta::1/64.  The last flow is
   for legacy applications using different ports numbers, the
   destination IPv6 address prefix is gamma::1/64.

   Figure 25 presents the protocol stack.  IPv6 and UDP are represented
   with dotted lines since these protocols are compressed on the radio
   link.

   In some LPWAN technologies, only the Devs have a device ID.  When
   such technologies are used, it is necessary to statically define an
   IID for the Link Local address for the SCHC C/D.

                         Figure 26: Context Rules

   Figure 26 describes a example of a Rule set.

   In this example, 0 was chosen as the special Rule ID that tags
   packets that cannot be compressed with any compression Rule.

   All the fields described in Rules 1-3 are present in the IPv6 and UDP
   headers.  The DevIID-DID value is found in the L2 header.

   Rules 2-3 use global addresses.  The way the Dev learns the prefix is
   not in the scope of the document.

   Rule 3 compresses each port number to 4 bits.

Appendix B.  Fragmentation Examples

   This section provides examples for the various fragment reliability
   modes specified in this document.  In the drawings, Bitmaps are shown
   in their uncompressed form.

   Figure 27 illustrates the transmission in No-ACK mode of a SCHC
   Packet that needs 11 SCHC Fragments.  FCN is 1 bit wide.

   o  Decision to use SCHC fragmentation mechanism or not.  If yes, the
      document must describe:

      *  reliability mode(s) used, in which cases (e.g., based on link
         channel condition)

      *  Rule ID values assigned to each mode in use

      *  presence and number of bits for DTag (T) for each Rule ID
         value, lifetime of DTag at the receiver

      *  support for interleaved packet transmission, to what extent

      *  WINDOW_SIZE, for modes that use windows

      *  number of bits for W (M) for each Rule ID value, for modes that
         use windows

      *  number of bits for FCN (N) for each Rule ID value

      *  what makes an All-0 SCHC Fragment and a SCHC ACK REQ
         distinguishable (see Section 8.3.1.1).

      *  what makes an All-1 SCHC Fragment and a SCHC Sender-Abort
         distinguishable (see Section 8.3.1.2).

      *  size of RCS and algorithm for its computation, for each Rule
         ID, if different from the default CRC32.  Byte fill-up with
         zeroes or other mechanism, to be specified.

      *  Retransmission Timer duration for each Rule ID value, if
         applicable to the SCHC F/R mode

      *  Inactivity Timer duration for each Rule ID value, if applicable
         to the SCHC F/R mode

      *  MAX_ACK_REQUESTS value for each Rule ID value, if applicable to
         the SCHC F/R mode

   o  if L2 Word is wider than a bit and SCHC fragmentation is used,

   A Profile may define a delay to be added after each SCHC message
   transmission for compliance with local regulations or other
   constraints imposed by the applications.

   o  In some LPWAN technologies, as part of energy-saving techniques,
      downlink transmission is only possible immediately after an uplink
      transmission.  In order to avoid potentially high delay in the
      downlink transmission of a fragmented SCHC Packet, the SCHC
      Fragment receiver may perform an uplink transmission as soon as
      possible after reception of a SCHC Fragment that is not the last
      one.  Such uplink transmission may be triggered by the L2 (e.g.,
      an L2 ACK sent in response to a SCHC Fragment encapsulated in a L2
      PDU that requires an L2 ACK) or it may be triggered from an upper
      layer.  See Appendix F.

   o  the following parameters need to be addressed in documents other
      than this one but not necessarily in the LPWAN technology-specific
      documents:

      *  The way the Contexts are provisioned

      *  The way the Rules are generated

Appendix E.  Supporting multiple window sizes for fragmentation

   For ACK-Always or ACK-on-Error, implementers may opt to support a
   single window size or multiple window sizes.  The latter, when
   feasible, may provide performance optimizations.  For example, a
   large window size should be used for packets that need to be split
   into a large number of tiles.  However, when the number of tiles
   required to carry a packet is low, a smaller window size, and thus a
   shorter Bitmap, may be sufficient to provide reception status on all
   tiles.  If multiple window sizes are supported, the Rule ID signals
   the window size in use for a specific packet transmission.

Appendix F.  ACK-Always and ACK-on-Error on quasi-bidirectional links

   The ACK-Always and ACK-on-Error modes of SCHC F/R are bidirectional
   protocols: they require a feedback path from the reassembler to the
   fragmenter.

   Some LPWAN technologies provide quasi-bidirectional connectivity,
   whereby a downlink transmission from the Network Infrastructure can
   only take place right after an uplink transmission by the Dev.

   When using SCHC F/R to send fragmented SCHC Packets downlink over
   these quasi-bidirectional links, the following situation may arise:
   if an uplink SCHC ACK is lost, the SCHC ACK REQ message by the sender



Minaburo, et al.          Expires June 7, 2020                 [Page 80]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                  December 2019


   could be stuck indefinitely in the downlink queue at the Network
   Infrastructure, waiting for a transmission opportunity.

   There are many ways by which this deadlock can be avoided.  The Dev
   application might be sending recurring uplink messages such as keep-
   alive, or the Dev application stack might be sending other recurring
   uplink messages as part of its operation.  However, these are out of
   the control of this generic SCHC specification.

   In order to cope with quasi-bidirectional links, a SCHC-over-foo
   specification may want to amend the SCHC F/R specification to add a
   timer-based retransmission of the SCHC ACK.  Below is an example of
   the suggested behavior for ACK-Always mode.  Because it is an
   example, [RFC2119] language is deliberately not used here.

   For downlink transmission of a fragmented SCHC Packet in ACK-Always
   mode, the SCHC Fragment receiver may support timer-based SCHC ACK
   retransmission.  In this mechanism, the SCHC Fragment receiver
   initializes and starts a timer (the UplinkACK Timer) after the
   transmission of a SCHC ACK, except when the SCHC ACK is sent in
   response to the last SCHC Fragment of a packet (All-1 fragment).  In
   the latter case, the SCHC Fragment receiver does not start a timer
   after transmission of the SCHC ACK.

   If, after transmission of a SCHC ACK that is not an All-1 fragment,
   and before expiration of the corresponding UplinkACK timer, the SCHC
   Fragment receiver receives a SCHC Fragment that belongs to the
   current window (e.g., a missing SCHC Fragment from the current
   window) or to the next window, the UplinkACK timer for the SCHC ACK
   is stopped.  However, if the UplinkACK timer expires, the SCHC ACK is
   resent and the UplinkACK timer is reinitialized and restarted.

   The default initial value for the UplinkACK Timer, as well as the
   maximum number of retries for a specific SCHC ACK, denoted
   MAX_ACK_REQUESTS, is to be defined in a Profile.  The initial value
   of the UplinkACK timer is expected to be greater than that of the
   Retransmission timer, in order to make sure that a (buffered) SCHC
   Fragment to be retransmitted finds an opportunity for that
   transmission.  One exception to this recommendation is the special
   case of the All-1 SCHC Fragment transmission.

   When the SCHC Fragment sender transmits the All-1 SCHC Fragment, it
   starts its Retransmission Timer with a large timeout value (e.g.,
   several times that of the initial UplinkACK Timer).  If a SCHC ACK is
   received before expiration of this timer, the SCHC Fragment sender
   retransmits any lost SCHC Fragments as reported by the SCHC ACK, or
   if the SCHC ACK confirms successful reception of all SCHC Fragments
   of the last window, the transmission of the fragmented SCHC Packet is

   considered complete.  If the timer expires, and no SCHC ACK has been
   received since the start of the timer, the SCHC Fragment sender
   assumes that the All-1 SCHC Fragment has been successfully received
   (and possibly, the last SCHC ACK has been lost: this mechanism
   assumes that the Retransmission Timer for the All-1 SCHC Fragment is
   long enough to allow several SCHC ACK retries if the All-1 SCHC
   Fragment has not been received by the SCHC Fragment receiver, and it
   also assumes that it is unlikely that several ACKs become all lost).
