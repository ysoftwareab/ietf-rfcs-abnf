Internet-Draft       ARIA Cipher Suites for TLS        October 1, 2010


Abstract

   This document specifies a set of cipher suites for the Transport
   Security Layer (TLS) protocol to support the ARIA encryption
   algorithm as a block cipher.

1. Introduction

   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] protocol to support the
   ARIA [RFC5794] encryption algorithm as a block cipher algorithm. The
   proposed cipher suites include variants using SHA-2 family of
   cryptographic hash functions and ARIA Galois counter mode. Elliptic
   curve cipher suites and pre-shared key (PSK) cipher suites are also
   included.

   The cipher suites with SHA-1 are not included in this document. Due
   to recent analytic work on SHA-1 [Wang05], the IETF is gradually
   moving away from SHA-1 and towards stronger hash algorithms.

1.1. ARIA

   ARIA is a general-purpose block cipher algorithm developed by Korean
   cryptographers in 2003. It is an iterated block cipher with 128-,
   192-, and 256-bit keys and encrypts 128-bit blocks in 12, 14, and 16
   rounds, depending on the key size. It is secure and suitable for
   most software and hardware implementations on 32-bit and 8-bit
   processors. It was established as a Korean standard block cipher
   algorithm in 2004 [ARIAKS] and has been widely used in Korea,
   especially for government-to-public services. It was included in
   PKCS #11 in 2007 [ARIAPKCS]. The algorithm specification and object
   identifiers are described in [RFC5794].

1.2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Proposed Cipher Suites

2.1. HMAC-based Cipher Suites

   The first twenty cipher suites use ARIA [RFC5794] in Cipher Block
   Chaining (CBC) mode with an HMAC-based MAC. Eight out of twenty use
   elliptic curves.

2.2. Galois Counter Mode-based Cipher Suites

   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_ARIA_256_GCM_SHA384     = { TBD,TBD };

3. Cipher Suite Definitions

3.1. Key Exchange

   The RSA, DHE_RSA, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DH_DSS, DH_anon, ECDH and ECDHE
   key exchanges are performed as defined in [RFC5246].

3.2. Cipher

   The ARIA_128_CBC cipher suites use ARIA [RFC5794] in CBC mode with a
   128-bit key and 128-bit IV; the ARIA_256_CBC cipher suites use a
   256-bit key and 128-bit IV.

   AES authenticated encryption with additional data algorithms,
   AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM are described in [RFC5116].
   And AES GCM cipher suites for TLS are described in [RFC5288]. AES
   and ARIA share common characteristics including key sizes and block
   length. ARIA_128_GCM and ARIA_256_GCM are defined according as those
   of AES.

3.3. PRFs

   The PRFs SHALL be as follows:

Internet-Draft       ARIA Cipher Suites for TLS        October 1, 2010


   a. For cipher suites ending with _SHA256, the PRF is the TLS
   PRF[RFC5246] using SHA-256 as the hash function.

   b. For cipher suites ending with _SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF
   [RFC5246] using SHA-384 as the hash function.

3.4. Pre-shared key (PSK) cipher suites

   Pre-shared key cipher suites for TLS are described in [RFC4279],
   [RFC4785], [RFC5487] and [RFC5489].

4. Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document no security problem has been
   found on ARIA (see [YWL]).

   The security considerations in previous RFCs [RFC3711, RFC4279,
   RFC4785, RFC5116, RFC5288, RFC5289, RFC5487] and [GCM] apply to this
   document as well.

   Cipher Suite Registry:
