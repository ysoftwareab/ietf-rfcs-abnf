Abstract

   This document updates the specification of the component matching
   rules for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and X.500
   directories (draft-legg-ldapext-component-matching-xx.txt) by
   collecting the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) definitions of
   the component matching rules into an appropriately identified ASN.1
   module so that other specifications may reference the component

   matching rule definitions from within their own ASN.1 modules.

1.  Introduction

   The structure or data type of data held in an attribute of a
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAP] or X.500 [X500]
   directory is described by the attribute's syntax.  Attribute syntaxes
   range from simple data types, such as text string, integer, or
   boolean, to complex data types, for example, the syntaxes of the
   directory schema operational attributes.  RFC XXXX [CMR] defines a
   generic way of matching user selected components in a directory
   attribute value of any arbitrarily complex attribute syntax.

   This document updates RFC XXXX by collecting the Abstract Syntax
   Notation One (ASN.1) [ASN1] definitions of RFC XXXX into an
   appropriately identified ASN.1 module so that other specifications
   may reference these definitions from within their own ASN.1 modules.

2.  Module Definition for Component Matching

       SYNTAX  NULL
       ID      { 1 2 36 79672281 1 13 5 } }

   END

   The InformationFramework ASN.1 module from which the MATCHING-RULE
   and RelativeDistinguishedName definitions are imported is defined in
   X.501 [X501].

   The object identifiers used in this document have been assigned for
   use in specifying the component matching rules by Adacel
   Technologies, under an arc assigned to Adacel by Standards Australia.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document collects together the ASN.1 definitions of the
   component matching rules into an ASN.1 module, but does not modify
   those definitions in any way.  See RFC XXXX [CMR] for the security
   considerations of using the component matching rules.
