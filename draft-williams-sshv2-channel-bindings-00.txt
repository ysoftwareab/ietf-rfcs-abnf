2.  Bindings to SSHv2 channels

   SSHv2 [RFC4251] provides both, a secure channel and material (the
   SSHv2 "session ID") that is suitable for use as channel binding
   identifiers [I-D.williams-on-channel-bindings].

   Thus it is RECOMMENDED that the SSHv2 "session ID" be used as the
   channel bindings for SSHv2.
