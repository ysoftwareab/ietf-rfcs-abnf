Abstract

      The '93 X.500 Directory standards define HOB (Hierarchical
      Operational Binding) procedures for the creation of a new naming
      context in another DSA, and also for the maintenance of the
      relationship between two DSAs where one holds a superior naming
      context and the other holds a subordinate naming context.  The
      standards also define the use of the Directory Operational
      Binding Management Protocol (DOP) to mediate these procedures.

      The use of HOBs provides a major simplification for managers of
      X.500 systems, since it provides a way to update policies
      automatically from one DSA to another.  But practical design for
      HOBs requires decisions in a number of respects not fully treated
      by the standards.  This document simplifies the implementor's
      task by defining viable and practical subsets of the standards
      and by clarifying some of the issues left undefined by the
      standards.  It was originated by EGDIR, the expert group within

1. Introduction

      This document provides guidelines for the implementation of
      Hierarchical Bindings (HOBs) by profiling the behaviour of a DSA
      in the context of HOBs.  It may also provides a basis for
      procurement of implementations that purport to offer HOB
      functionality.

      The HOB represents the relationship between two DSAs when one
      holds a superior naming context and the other contains (or is to
      contain) a subordinate naming context.

      A HOB can only come into existence when the administrative
      authorities of each DSA permit it (e.g.  by configuration of the
      DSA).  It can be initiated in one of two ways:

      1.  By direct management action on the part of the administrative
      authority of one of the two DSAs

      2.  By the DSA that completes name resolution acting on an
      add-entry operation which specifies that an entry is to be placed
      in a DSA other than that holding its superior entry.

INTERNET-DRAFT Hierarchical Operational Bindings - a profile June 1997



      In both cases, the HOB is initiated by an exchange of Directory
      Operational Management Binding Protocol (DOP) which establishes
      the Operational Binding.

      In the former case, the superior naming context and the
      subordinate reference to it from the superior DSA are presumed to
      pre-exist.  In the latter case, the exchange passes information
      about the contents of the new entry to the subordinate DSA, and
      form a part of a standardised procedure whereby (among other
      features):

      *   The subordinate DSA creates a new naming context by adding a
          context prefix entry with the required name and attribute
          information

      *   The superior DSA provides the DSA holding the subordinate
          naming context with all of the policy information (access
          control, subschema and collective attributes) required to
          administer the naming context

      *   The superior DSA creates a subordinate reference to the
          subordinate DSA with the required name

      Once the HOB is established, it provides a means of automatically
      maintaining access point and policy information relevant to the
      naming context in the subordinate DSA and to the corresponding
      subordinate reference held in the superior DSA.

      A related process is described in the Standards whereby the
      reference from the superior to the subordinate DSA is a Non
      Specific Subordinate Reference.  This process is not within the
      scope of the present document.

      The objective of this document is to define capabilities and
      constraints on support for DSP by DSAs so that DSAs will be able
      to interwork using HOBs within the Directory.

      It therefore profiles the following:

      *   The configuration of DSAs in preparation for establishment 
          of HOBs

      *   A superior DSA using a DOP establish-operational-binding
          operation to create a subordinate naming context in order to
          implement an add-entry operation in which the targetSystem
          element is present

      *   A subordinate DSA responding to a DOP
          establish-operational-binding operation

INTERNET-DRAFT Hierarchical Operational Bindings - a profile June 1997



      *   Superior and subordinate DSAs as invokers and responders of
          DOP modify-operational-binding operations

      *   Superior and subordinate DSAs as invokers and responders of
          DOP terminate-operational-binding operations

      DSAs supporting HOBs are required by the base standards to
      support DSP.

      HOB operations normally require the establishment of a DOP
      association within which each DSA will have authenticated itself
      to the other using simple authentication or better.  The means of
      doing this is not within the scope of this document.  However,
      the requirement to do so is profiled here.

2. Scenario 

      DSAs may be configured by their administrative authorities (by
      means outside the scope of the Directory standards) to allow them
      to create or accept Hierarchical Operational Bindings.

Administrative                    Administrative
                 authority                        authority 
                     \                                /
                       +--------+         +-----------+

      administr-       |  DSA   | DSA     |    DSA    |
      ative user       |   *    |         |     ^     |
      creating      DAP|  /*\   |   DOP   |    / \    |
      new naming  ====>| /***\  |<=======>|   /   \   |

      or maintain-     |   sub  |         |     /*\   |
      ing existing     |   ref  |         |    /***\  |
      one              +--------+         +-----------+

         Figure 1-DSA support of Hierarchical Operational Bindings

      A DSA configured in this way may then (after suitable stimulus)
      interact with another DSA using DOP operations.  This stimulus
      may be direct management action, or it may be DAP or DSP protocol
      action.  A particular stimulus is a request by an administrative
      user to establish a new naming context (triangle of asterisks at
      bottom of box for subordinate DSA).  Another may be an
      administrative authority action to coordinate two DSAs which
      already contain a superior and a subordinate naming context.

4. Conformance - Hierarchical Operational Bindings

      This document specifies requirements upon DSA implementations to
      achieve interworking when using HOBs.  A claim of conformance to
      this document is a claim that all requirements in the relevant
      base standards are satisfied, and that all requirements in the
      following clauses are satisfied.

4.1 Static Conformance Requirements

      To conform to this document, DSA implementations MUST conform to
      all mandatory requirements of clause 9.2 in ISO/IEC 9594-5:1993
      (X.519), of Section 10 of ISO/IEC 9594-2:1993 (X.501), extended
      by mandatory requirements of Clause 24 of ISO/IEC 9594-4:1993
      (X.518), as applicable to a DSA implementing the
      directoryOperationalBindingManagementAC application context,
      including the requirements directly and indirectly referenced by
      that clause.

      NOTE.  A DSA claiming conformance to the
      directoryOperationalBindingManagementAC MUST also claim
      conformance to the directorySystemAC (see X.518 clause 9.2.1 a)).

4.1.1 General capability

      DSAs conformant with this document MUST be capable of:

      1.  Acting in both ROLE-A (superior DSA) and ROLE B (subordinate
          DSA), in accordance with X.518 clause 24.2, in order to
          implement the procedures associated with the targetSystem
          element of the DAP add-entry operation

      2.  When in ROLE-A (superior DSA), accepting an add-entry
          operation specifying targetSystem, and carrying out the
          procedures defined in X.518 clause 24.3 for the establishment
          of a HOB.

      DSAs should be capable of acting in ROLE-A (superior DSA), or
      ROLE B (subordinate DSA), or both, in accordance with X.518
      clause 24.2, in order to implement a Hierarchical Operational
      Binding in respect of a pre-existing subordinate naming context
      which was established by local means.

      DSAs conformant with this document MUST be able to tolerate the
      case where they contain a superior or subordinate DSA, but no HOB
      exists.

4.1.2 HOB acceptability

      DSAs conformant with this document MUST be configurable to reject
      HOBS under the following circumstances, in order to permit
      administrative authorities sufficient control over hierarchical
      bindings:

INTERNET-DRAFT Hierarchical Operational Bindings - a profile June 1997



      1.  A ROLE-A DSA conformant with this document MUST be
          configurable to reject an add-entry operation specifying
          targetSystem in respect of any specific DSA.  In this case,
          it may either ignore the targetSystem element or respond to
          the invoker of the operation with a suitable error.  The
          latter capability is mandatory if target-system is specified
          as a critical extension.

      2.  A ROLE-A DSA conformant with this document MUST be
          configurable to reject an attempt to create a HOB when the
          proposed new naming context for the DSA has a name which is
          unacceptable when this is proposed by a ROLE-B DSA.  It MUST
          be possible for any specific name for an entry immediately
          subordinate to entries already held by the DSA to be
          configured as unacceptable in this sense, for the purposes of
          conformance testing.

      3.  A ROLE-B DSA conformant with this document MUST be
          configurable to reject a HOB when the naming context for the
          DSA has a name which is unacceptable when this is proposed by
          a ROLE-A DSA.  It MUST be possible for any entry name that is
          not superior or subordinate to entries already held by the
          DSA to be configured as unacceptable in this sense, for the
          purposes of conformance testing, possibly by implementing a
          list of names which are acceptable.

      4.  A ROLE-B DSA conformant with this document MUST be
          configurable to reject a HOB when this is proposed by any
          specific DSA attempting to act as a ROLE-A DSA.

4.1.3 HOB operations

      DSAs MUST support establishment, modification and termination
      operations in both ROLE-A and ROLE-B, within limitations defined
      in clause 4.2.

4.1.4 Information supported by HOBs

      ROLE A DSAs conformant with this document MUST support the supply
      and maintenance of all relevant administrative point and subentry
      information for each vertex between the root and the subordinate
      naming context (except when specified below as optional).  This
      includes:

      *   Access control information (both BAC and SAC)

      *   Subschema information (optionally)

      *   Collective attribute information (optionally)


ISSS EGDIR                                                    [Page 8]


INTERNET-DRAFT Hierarchical Operational Bindings - a profile June 1997



      ROLE-A and Role-B DSAs MUST support the supply and maintenance of
      their own access points.

      ROLE-A DSAs are not required to support the modification of a HOB
      which would change the DN of the context prefix for the
      subordinate naming context except that ROLE-A DSAs are required
      to support a change in RDN of the subordinate context prefix
      (while retaining the DN of the superior entry).

      ROLE-A DSAs are not required to support the modification of a HOB
      which would change the DN of the context prefix for the superior
      naming context without changing the DN of the context prefix for
      the subordinate naming context (i.e.  moving the context prefix
      for the subordinate naming context up or down the DIT).

      ROLE-B DSAs are not required to supply and maintain entry
      information for the context prefix in the superior DSA (i.e.  as
      entryInfo in the SubordinateToSuperior establishment parameter -
      see X.518 clause 24.4.1.2).  If not supplied, the superior DSA
      cannot make access control decisions that take into account
      policies within the subordinate DSA; it may be able to implement
      locally defined policies instead.  However, they are recommended
      to do so.

      NOTE.  If however they do so supply it, they MUST be capable of
      maintaining it (see 4.1.5).

4.1.5 Established Hierarchical Bindings

      After a hierarchical operational binding has been successfully
      established, the following requirements are placed on ROLE-A and
      ROLE-B DSAs:

      1.  ROLE-A DSAs MUST be capable of establishing a DOP
          association, and using it to invoke a
          modify-operational-binding operation consequent upon the
          following stimuli:

          *   Any change in contextPrefixInfo as it would be
              transmitted in modify-operational-binding argument

          *   Any change in the access point of the DSA

      2.  ROLE-B DSAs MUST similarly be capable of establishing a DOP
          association, and using it to invoke a
          modify-operational-binding operation consequent upon the
          following stimuli:

INTERNET-DRAFT Hierarchical Operational Bindings - a profile June 1997



          *   Any change in entryInfo within the scope of interest to
              the ROLE-A DSA, to include object class and entryACI
              (when present)

          *   Any change in the access point of the DSA

      Either role is permitted to invoke a modify-operational-binding
      operation under other circumstances, even when no change has
      taken place, for example following a crash.

4.1.6 Security Level

      Implementations MUST be able to carry out the peer entity
      authentication of DSAs by the following ways:

      *   Simple authentication with unprotected password

      The following methods of peer entity authentication are optional
      (see Note 2 below):

      *   Simple protected authentication 

      *   Strong authentication

      DSAs conformant with this document MUST be capable of rejecting
      DOP binds that use no authentication, or that use simple
      unprotected authentication without password.

      Notes

      1.  Since HOBS establish trusted relationships between DSAs,
          authentication must be adequately secure.  Credentials should
          normally be used.

      2.  The use of external authentication using the
          externalProcedure element in accordance with ISO/IEC
          9594-4:1993 (X.518) clause 11.1 and ISO/IEC 9594-3:1993
          (X.511) clause 8.1.2 is outside the scope of this document.

4.1.7 Disclosure of HOB information

      DSAs acting in ROLE-A or ROLE-B MUST be configurable to refuse
      direct DAP or DSP access to any information received as a result
      of the HOB, other than entryInfo by a ROLE B DSA.

      NOTE.  This requirement states that the following information is
      regarded as internal, although access to it may be required for
      system management or diagnostic purposes, even when it can in
      principle be formulated to provide attribute information:

      *   SuperiorToSubordinate.contextPrefixInfo

      *   SuperiorToSubordinate.immediateSuperiorInfo

      *   SubordinateToSuperior

4.1.8 Initiation by administrative intervention

      DSAs may optionally support the initiation of a HOB in respect of
      a pre-existing naming context.  If supported, initiation MUST be
      possible by either the ROLE-A or the ROLE-B DSA creating a DOP
      association and invoking an establish-operational-binding
      operation conformant with HOB requirements.

      Following successful establishment, each DSA conformant to this
      document MUST support modify-operational-binding operations as in
      clause 4.1.4.

4.1.9 Validity

      Since a HOB represents the existence of bothe a superior and a
      subordinate naming context, DSAs in ROLE-A and ROLE-B are not
      required to support validity other than the default validity for
      the operational binding:

      *   Valid from now ...

      *   Until explicitly terminated

      ROLE-A and ROLE-B DSAs are permitted to act always as if this
      were the validity used (see 4.2.2).

4.1.10 Termination

      A ROLE-A DSA may optionally be capable of invoking a termination
      operation for an active HOB.  This can only occur as a
      consequence of Administrative Authority action.

      A ROLE-B DSA MUST be capable of invoking a termination operation
      for an active HOB when the naming context is removed (e.g.  by a
      remove-entry operation for the context prefix).

A ROLE-B DSA may optionally be capable of invoking a termination
      operation for an active HOB when the naming context still exists.

4.2 Dynamic Conformance Requirements

      To conform to document, implementations MUST conform to all
      mandatory requirements of 9.2.3 and 7.5 in ISO/IEC 9594-5:1993
      (X.519) for a DSA supporting s the
      directoryOperationalBindingManagementAC application context.
      Implementations MUST conform to all procedures specified in the
      directory base standards relating to Hierarchical Operational
      Bindings, as amended by the corrigenda listed in clause 7 of this
      document, as they relate to operations and protocol elements for
      which support is claimed in the PICS.  Attention is drawn to the
      following clauses of ISO/IEC 9594-4:1993 (X.518):

      *   Add-entry operations affecting HOBs (clause 19.1.1) ,
          including those that add relevant subentries

      *   Remove-entry operations affecting HOBs (clause 19.1.2),
          including those that remove relevant subentries

      *   Modify-entry operations affecting HOBs (clause 19.1.3),
          including those that remove relevant subentries

      *   Modify-DN operations affecting HOBs (clause 19.1.4),
          including those that change the names of relevant subentries

      There are limitations on the support for modify-DN operations
      (see 4.1.4).

4.2.1 ROLE-A Support - Establishment Parameters

4.2.1.1 Vertex

      In the case of administrative points, the following information
      MUST be supplied in contextPrefixInfo for each vertex:

      *   In admPointInfo, the administrative role attribute if
          relevant (i.e.  there is no ppp-specific point interposed
          between the vertex and the new entry where ppp is any of the
          three administrative purposes: access-control, subschema
          administration, collective attributes)

      *   In admPointInfo, the access-control-scheme attribute if
          relevant (i.e.  there is no access control specific point
          interposed between the vertex and the new entry)

      *   In subentryInfo, the complete information in all relevant
          subentries (i.e.  subentries for each administrative purpose
          ppp where there is no ppp-specific point interposed between
          the vertex and the new entry)


ISSS EGDIR                                                   [Page 12]


INTERNET-DRAFT Hierarchical Operational Bindings - a profile June 1997



      The accessPoints element MUST be present when the vertex
      corresponds to the context prefix of the superior naming context
      which is the subject of the HOB.  However a ROLE-A DSA is
      permitted to pass either an empty SET OF as
      MasterAndShadowAccessPoints or a SET OF that contains only the
      master access-point (i.e.  a reference to itself).

      If shadow access points are present in
      MasterAndShadowAccessPoints, the master access-point MUST also be
      present.

4.2.1.2 Entry information

      When the HOB is initiated as a result of an add-entry operation,
      the DSA MUST supply in SET OF Attribute the exact information
      supplied by SET OF Attribute within the add-entry operation.

4.2.1.3 Immediate superior info

      The ImmediateSuperiorInfo element MUST be supported, and MUST
      contain the objectClass and entryACI attributes.

      NOTES

      1.  The DSA is permitted to be configurable to not transmit this
          element

      2.  The DSA is permitted to supply other attributes

4.2.2 Validity

      Since a HOB of this kind represents a de-facto situation (i.e.
      the presence or otherwise of a subordinate naming context), the
      components of Validity are not relevant to practical operations.

      Initiating DSAs are recommended to use the default (element is
      absent), meaning valid from now until explicitly terminated.

      Responding DSAs are permitted to ignore the element (i.e.  treat
      it as if the default had been received).

4.2.3 ROLE-B Support - Establishment Parameters

      DSAs acting in ROLE-B MUST be capable of supporting:

      1.  Administrative information supplied in contextPrefixInfo, in
          respect of some or all of the administrative purposes:




ISSS EGDIR                                                   [Page 13]


INTERNET-DRAFT Hierarchical Operational Bindings - a profile June 1997



          *   Access control (mandatory)

          *   Subschema administration (optional but should be 
              supported)

          *   Collective attributes (optional but should be supported)

          within the requirements of:

          *   DSA Simple Access Control or DSA Basic Access Control

          *   Administrative Areas

          *   Schema Administration

      2.  Knowledge information for an immediate-superior reference
          supplied in accessPoints within contextPrefixInfo.

      A DSA is not required to implement the optimisation of the list
      operation supported by ImmediateSuperiorInfo (X.518 clause
      19.3.1.2.1 3 a), 24.1.4.2 Note).

      A DSA MUST support the subordinateToSuperior value as follows:

      *   accessPoints MUST be supported, except that only support for
          a master reference is required (Shadow references wouldn't be
          available at this stage, but they could be present for the
          use in MODIFICATION-PARAMETERS).

      *   alias may optionally be supported

      *   entryInfo may optionally be supported

      When entryInfo is supported, it MUST comprise at least:

      *   The objectClass attribute

      *   An entryACI attribute, synthesised as necessary to contain 
          all the ACI that is relevant to the access of the context 
          prefix.

      The last of these is used to indicate all of the ACI relevant to
      the entry which is derived from the context prefix's entry ACI
      (if any) together with any precriptive ACI derived from the
      context prefix's subentries (if any) and relevant to the context
      prefix.  The ACI values are simply gathered together to form a
      synthesised attribute.  This information can be supplied to
      optimise the handling of access control for lists, and also to



ISSS EGDIR                                                   [Page 14]


INTERNET-DRAFT Hierarchical Operational Bindings - a profile June 1997



      regulate access to subordinate reference information.  Disclosing
      the latter could give rise to a breach of security, and the entry
      ACI helps xontrol this.

      This entryACI may be passed back even if if SAC is to be used.

4.2.4 Modification Parameters

4.2.4.1 ROLE-A Parameters

      Support MUST be as for establishment parameters, except that
      entryInfo is absent in SuperiorToSubordinateModification (it is
      otherwise identical to SuperiorToSubordinate).

4.2.4.2 ROLE-B Parameters

      Support MUST be as for establishment parameters.

4.2.5 Termination

      A ROLE-B DSA in receipt of a termination invoke from a ROLE-A DSA
      MUST be capable of accepting the termination.  However, there is
      no requirement to remove the subordinate naming context, or to
      change any of the administrative policies that pre-existed before
      the termination.

      A ROLE-B DSA MUST be capable of invoking a termination operation
      for an active HOB when the naming context is removed (e.g.  by a
      remove-entry operation for the context prefix).

      A ROLE-A DSA from a ROLE-A DSA in receipt of a termination invoke
      MUST be capable of accepting the termination.

4.2.6 Rules of Extensibility for Result and Error Handling

      Implementations MUST satisfy the rule of extensibility for result
      and error handling specified in clause 7.5 of ISO/IEC 9594-5:1993
      (X.519).

4.2.7 Digital Signatures

      Digital signatures are not supported by 1993 DOP operations
      (although this anomaly is rectified by the 1997 Directory
      standards).

INTERNET-DRAFT Hierarchical Operational Bindings - a profile June 1997



4.2.8 Errors

      Operational binding errors MUST be supported by ROLE-A and ROLE-B
      DSAs in conformance with X.501 clause 24.5.

5. Security considerations

      HOBs permit an intimate relationship to exist between two DSAs;
      the feature needs to be carefully protected.  For this reason,
      adequate authentication is required, and DSAs need to be designed
      to accept HOBs only from suitably qualified sites.  In addition,
      the initiation of a HOB is only tolerable when done by a
      qualified administrative user.

      The scenario for HOB creation and management is likely to be
      constrained mostly to a single organisation; this means that
      simpler forms of authentication may be adequate in the short
      term.

      support defined by this document.
