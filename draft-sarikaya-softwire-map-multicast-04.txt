  Multicast Support for Mapping of Address and Port Protocol and Light

Abstract

   This memo specifies multicast component for MAP and Light Weight
   4over6 so that IPv4 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4
   servers over an IPv6 network.  The solution developed is based on
   translation.  In the Translation Multicast solution for MAP (MAP-E
   and MAP-T) and lw4o6, IGMP messages are translated into MLD messages
   and sent to the network in IPv6.  MAP Border Relay/lwAFTR does the
   reverse translation and joins IPv4 multicast group for the hosts.
   Border Relay/lwAFTR as multicast router receives IPv4 multicast data
   and translates the packet into IPv6 multicast data and sends
   downstream on the multicast tree.  Member CEs/lwB4s receive multicast
   data, translate it back to IPv4 and transmit to the hosts.

1.  Introduction

   With IPv4 address depletion on the horizon, many techniques are being
   standardized for IPv6 migration including Mapping of Address and Port
   (MAP) - Encapsulation, - Translation and 4rd [I-D.ietf-softwire-map],
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t], [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd].  MAP/4rd enables
   IPv4 hosts to communicate with external hosts using IPv6 only ISP
   network.  MAP/4rd Customer Edge (CE) device's LAN side is dual stack
   and WAN side is IPv6 only.  CE tunnels/translates IPv4 packets
   received from the LAN side to 4rd Border Relays (BR).  BRs have
   anycast IPv6 addresses and receive encapsulated/translated packets
   from CEs over a virtual interface.  MAP/4rd operation is stateless.
   Packets are received/ sent independent of each other and no state
   needs to be maintained except for NAT44 operation on IPv4 packets
   received from the user.

Internet-Draft  Multicast Support for MAP-E and Lw4over6       June 2015


   Light Weight 4 Over 6 (lw4o6) is a variant of Dual Stack Lite where
   carrier grade NAT is moved from AFTR to B4 element, i.e. NAPT is done
   locally at each B4 called light weight B4 or lwB4.  Unicast lw4o6
   takes user IPv4 packets from the local LAN and lwB4 does a NAPT and
   then tunnels the packets in an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to lwAFTR which
   decapsulates the packet and then sends it to IPv4 network.  Incoming
   packets follow reverse route and are encapsulated at lwAFTR and sent
   to lwB4 which decapsulates and after NAPT operation transmits to the
   destination.

   It should be noted that there is no depletion problem for IPv4
   address space allocated for any source multicast and source specific
   multicast [RFC3171].  This document is not motivated by the depletion
   of IPv4 multicast addresses.

   MAP-E, MAP-T, 4rd and lw4o6 are unicast only.  They do not support
   multicast.  In this document we specify how multicast from home IPv4
   users can be supported in MAP-E (as well as MAP-T and 4rd) and lw4o6.

   In case IPv6 network is multicast enabled, MAP-T/4rd can provide
   multicast service to the hosts using MAP-T/4rd Multicast Translation
   based solution.  A Multicast Translator can be used that receives
   IPv4 multicast group management messages in IGMP and generates
   corresponding IPv6 group management messages in MLD and sends them to
   IPv6 network towards MAP-T/4rd Border Relay.  We use
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t] or [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] for sending IPv4
   multicast data in IPv6 to the CE routers.  At MAP-T/4rd CE router
   another translator is needed to translate IPv6 multicast data into
   IPv4 multicast data.

   It should be noted that if IPv6 network is multicast enabled the
   translation multicast solution presented in Section 4 can also be
   used for MAP-E.

   In this document we address MAP-E (and MAP-T/4rd) and lw4o6 multicast
   problem and propose the architecture of Multicast Translation based
   solution.  Section 2 is on terminology, Section 3 is on architecture,
   Section 4 is on multicast translation protocol, and Section 5 states
   security considerations.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map], [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6],
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t], [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd], [RFC3810] and
   [RFC3376].

3.  Architecture

   In MAP-E, MAP-T and 4rd, there are hosts (possibly IPv4/ IPv6 dual
   stack) served by MAP-E, MAP-T and 4rd Customer Edge device.  CE is
   dual stack facing the hosts and IPv6 only facing the network or WAN
   side.  MAP-E, MAP-T and 4rd CE may be local IPv4 Network Address and
   Port Translation (NAPT) box [RFC3022] by assigning private IPv4
   addresses to the hosts.  MAP-E, MAP-T and 4rd CEs in the same domain
   may use shared public IPv4 addresses on their WAN side and if they do
   they should avoid ports outside of the allocated port set for NAPT
   operation.  At the boundary of the network there is MAP-E, MAP-T and
   4rd Border Relay.  BR receives IPv4 packets tunneled in IPv6 from CE
   and decapsulates them and sends them out to IPv4 network.

   Unicast MAP-E, MAP-T and 4rd are stateless except for the local NAPT
   at the CE.  Each IPv4 packet sent by CE treated separately and
   different packets from the same CE may go to different BRs or CEs.
   CE encapsulates IPv4 packet in IPv6 with destination address set to
   BR address (usually anycast IPv6 address).  BR receives the
   encapsulated packet and decapsulates and send it to IPv4 network.
   CEs are configured with Rule IPv4 Prefixes, Rule IPv6 Prefixes and
   with an BR IPv6 anycast address.  BR receives IPv4 packets addressed
   to this ISP and from the destination address it extracts the
   destination host's IPv4 address and uses this address as destination
   address and encapsulates the IPv4 packet in IPv6 and sends it to
   IPv6-only network.

   Unicast Lightweight 4over6 (lw4o6) is a variation of Dual-Stack Lite
   (DS-Lite) [RFC6333] which moves carrier-grade IPv4-IPv4 NAT from the
   Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) element to the Basic Bridging
   BroadBand (B4) element [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6].  The resulting
   elements are called lwAFTR and lwB4 with NAPT, respectively.  Lw4o6
   also adopts some features from MAP-E.  A+P scheme of public IPv4
   address sharing is used by lwB4's in assigning WAN side IPv4 public
   addresses with a distinct port set.  As in MAP-E, encapsulation of
   IPv4 packets in IPv6 and decapsulation is according to [RFC2473].

3.1.  MAP-T and 4rd Translation Architecture

   In case IPv6 only network is multicast enabled, translation multicast
   architecture can be used.  CE implements IGMP Proxy function
   [RFC4605] towards the LAN side and MLD Proxy on its WAN interface.
   IPv4 hosts send their join requests (IGMP Membership Report messages)
   to CE.  CE as a MLD proxy sends aggregated MLD Report messages
   upstream towards BR.  CE replies MLD membership query messages with
   MLD membership report messages based on IGMP membership state in the
   IGMP/MLD proxy.

   BR is MLD querier on its WAN side.  On its interface to IPv4 network
   BR may either have IGMP client or PIM.  PIM being able to support
   both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast should be preferred.  BR receives MLD
   join requests, extracts IPv4 multicast group address and then joins
   the group upstream, possibly by issuing a PIM join message.

   IPv4 multicast data received by the BR as a leaf node in IPv4
   multicast distribution tree is translated into IPv6 multicast data by
   the translator using [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t],
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] and then sent downstream to the IPv6 part of
   the multicast tree to all downstream routers that are members.  IPv6
   data packet eventually gets to the CE.  At the CE, a reverse
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t], [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] operation takes
   place by the translator and then IPv4 multicast data packet is sent
   to the member hosts on the LAN interface.  [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t],
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] are modified to handle multicast addresses.

   In order to support SSM, IGMPv3 MUST be supported by the host, CE and
   BR.  For ASM, BR MUST be the Rendezvous Point (RP).

   MAP-T and 4rd Translation Multicast solution uses the multicast 46
   translator in not one but two places in the architecture: at the CE
   router and at the Border Relay.  IPv4 multicast data received at 4rd
   BR goes through a [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] header-mapping into IPv6
   multicast data at the BR and another [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] header-
   mapping back to IPv4 multicast data at the CE router.  Encapsulation
   variant of [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] is not used.  In case of MAP-T,
   IPv4 data packet is translated using v4 to v6 header translation
   using multicast addresses instead of the mapping algorithm used in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t].

   All the elements of MAP-T and 4rd translation-based multicast support
   system are shown in Figure 1.

       Figure 1: Architecture of MAP-T and 4rd Translation Multicast

   In case IPv6 only network is multicast enabled, translation multicast
   architecture can also be used for lw4o6 multicast. lwB4 implements
   IGMP Proxy function [RFC4605] towards the LAN side and MLD Proxy on
   its WAN interface.  IPv4 hosts send their join requests (IGMP
   Membership Report messages) to lwB4.  lwB4 as a MLD proxy sends
   aggregated MLD Report messages upstream towards lwAFTR.  lwB4 replies
   MLD membership query messages with MLD membership report messages
   based on IGMP membership state in the IGMP/MLD proxy.

   lwAFTR is MLD querier on its WAN side.  On its interface to IPv4
   network lwAFTR may either have IGMP client or PIM.  PIM being able to
   support both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast should be preferred. lwAFTR
   receives MLD join requests, extracts IPv4 multicast group address and
   then joins the group upstream, possibly by issuing a PIM join
   message.

   For multicast data, [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast] uses
   encapsulation of IPv4 multicast data in IPv6 multicast data packet
   but in this document we use translation.  IPv4 multicast data
   received by the lwAFTR as a leaf node in IPv4 multicast distribution
   tree is translated into IPv6 multicast data by the translator and
   then sent downstream to the IPv6 part of the multicast tree to all
   downstream routers that are members.  IPv6 data packet eventually
   gets to the lwB4.  At the lwB4, a reverse translation operation takes
   place by the translator and then IPv4 multicast data packet is sent
   to the member hosts on the LAN interface.  The translation algorithm
   in [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t], [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] are modified to
   handle multicast addresses.

   In order to support SSM, IGMPv3 MUST be supported by the host, lwB4
   and lwAFTR.  For ASM, lwAFTR MUST be the Rendezvous Point (RP).

4.  MAP-T and 4rd Translation Multicast Operation

   In this section we specify how the host can subscribe and receive
   IPv4 multicast data from IPv4 content providers based on the
   architecture defined in Figure 1 in two parts: address translation
   and protocol translation.  Translation details are given in
   Appendix A.

4.1.  Address Translation

   IPv4-only host, H1 will join IPv4 multicast group by sending IGMP
   Membership Report message upstream towards the IGMP Proxy in
   Figure 1.  MLD Proxy first creates a synthesized IPv6 address of IPv4
   multicast group address using IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address
   format [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format].  ASM_MPREFIX64
   for any source multicast groups and SSM_MPREFIX64 for source specific
   multicast groups are used.  Both are /96 prefixes.

   SSM_MPREFIX64 is set to ff3x:0:8000::/96, with 'x' set to any valid
   scope.  ASM_MPREFIX64 values are formed as shown in Figure 3.  Flag
   field 1 (ff1) field is defined in [RFC7371] bits M bit MUST BE set to
   1. "scop" field is defined in [RFC3956].  Flag field 2 (ff2) is a set
   of 4 flags rrrM where r bits MUST be set to zero.  M bit is set to 1
   to indicate that a multicast IPv4 address is embedded in the low-

   order 32 bits of the multicast IPv6 address. "sub-group-id" field
   MUST follow the recommendations specified in [RFC3306] if unicast-
   based prefix is used or the recommendations specified in [RFC3956] if
   embedded-RP is used.  The default value is all zeros.

     +--------+----+----+----+------------------------------+----------+
     |11111111|ff1 |scop|ff2 |         sub-group-id         |v4 address|
     +--------+----+----+----+-----------------------------------------+

                     Figure 3: ASM_MPREFIX64 Formation

   Each translator in the upstream BR is assigned a unique ASM_MPREFIX64
   prefix.  CE (MLD Proxy in CE) can learn this value by means out of
   scope with this document.  With this, CE can easily create an IPv6
   multicast address from the IPv4 group address a.b.c.d that the host
   wants to join.

   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) can also be supported similar to the
   Any Source Multicast (ASM) described above.  In case of SSM, IPv4
   multicast addresses use 232.0.0.0/8 prefix.  IPv6 SSM_MPREFIX64 is
   set to FF3x:0:8000::/96 where 'x' is any valid scope.

   Since SSM translation requires a unique address for each IPv4
   multicast source, an IPv6 unicast prefix must be configured to the
   translator in the upstream BR to represent IPv4 sources.  This prefix
   is prepended to IPv4 source addresses in translated packets.

   The join message from the host for the group ASM_MPREFIX64:a.b.c.d or
   SSM_MPREFIX64:a.b.c.d or an aggregate join message will be received
   by MLD querier at the BR.  BR as multicast anchor checks the group
   address and recognizes ASM_MPREFIX64 or SSM_MPREFIX64 prefix.  It
   next checks the last 32 bits is an IPv4 multicast address in range
   224/8 - 239/8.  If all checks succeed, IGMPv4 Client joins a.b.c.d
   using IGMP on its IPv4 interface.

   Joining IPv4 groups can also be done using PIM since PIM supports
   both IPv4 and IPv6.  The advantage of using PIM is that there is no
   need to enable IGMP support in neighboring IPv4 routers.  The
   advantage of using IGMP is that IGMP is a simpler protocol and it is
   supported by a wider range of routers.  The use of PIM or IGMP is
   left as an implementation choice.

   Address translation described above for MAP-T applies to lw4over6
   multicast translation where the entities involved are lwB4 replaces
   Customer Edge device and lwAFTR replaces BR Figure 2.

4.2.  Protocol Translation

   The hosts will send their subscription requests for IPv4 multicast
   groups upstream to the default router, i.e. Costumer Edge device.
   After subscribing the group, the host can receive multicast data from
   the CE.  The host implements IGMP protocol's host part.

   Customer Edge device is IGMP Proxy facing the LAN interface.  After
   receiving the first IGMP Report message requesting subscription to an
   IPv4 multicast group, a.b.c.d, MLD Proxy in the CE's WAN interface
   synthesizes an IPv6 multicast group address corresponding to a.b.c.d
   and sends an MLD Report message upstream to join the group.

   When MAP-T or 4rd BR receives IPv4 multicast data for an IPv4 group
   a.b.c.d it [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] translates/encapsulates IPv4
   packet into IPv6 multicast packet and sends it to IPv6 synthesized
   address corresponding to a.b.c.d using ASM_MPREFIX64 or
   SSM_MPREFIX64.  The header mapping described in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] Section 4.2 (using Table 1) is used except
   for mapping the source and destination addresses.  In this document
   we use the multicast address translation described in Section 4.1 and
   propose it as a complementary enhancement to the translation
   algorithm in [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd].

   The IP/ICMP translation translates IPv4 packets into IPv6 using
   minimum MTU size of 1280 bytes (Section 4.3 in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd]) but this can be changed for multicast.  Path
   MTU discovery for multicast is possible in IPv6 so 4rd BR can perform
   path MTU discovery for each ASM group and use these values instead of
   1280.  For SSM, a different MTU value MUST be kept for each SSM
   channel.  Because of this 8 bytes added by IPv6 fragment header in
   each data packet can be tolerated.

   Since multicast address translation does not preserve checksum
   neutrality, [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] translator/encapsulator at 4rd BR
   must however modify the UDP checksum to replace the IPv4 addresses
   with the IPv6 source and destination addresses in the pseudo-header
   which consists of source address, destination address, protocol and
   UDP length fields before calculating the new checksum.

   IPv6 multicast data must be translated back to IPv4 at the 4rd CE
   (e.g. using Table 2 in Section 4.3 of [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd]).  Such
   a task is much simpler than the translation at 4rd BR because IPv6
   header is much simpler than IPv4 header and IPv4 link on the LAN side
   of 4rd CE is a local link.  The packet is sent on the local link to
   IPv4 group address a.b.c.d for IPv6 group address of
   ASM_MPREFIX64:a.b.c.d or SSM_MPREFIX64:a.b.c.d.

   In case an IPv4 multicast source sends multicast data with the don't
   fragment (DF) flag set to 1, [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] header mapping
   sets the D bit in IPv6 fragment header before sending the packet
   downstream as in Fig. 3 in Section 4.3 of [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd].
   This feature of [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] preserves the semantics of DF
   flag at the BR and CE.

   Because MAP-T/4rd is stateless, Multicast MAP-T/4rd should stay
   faithful to this as much as possible.  Border Relay acts as the
   default multicast querier for all CEs that have established multicast
   communication with it.  In order to keep a consistent multicast state
   between a CE and BR, CE MUST use the same IPv6 multicast prefixes
   (ASM_MPREFIX64/SSM_REFIX64) until the state becomes empty.  After
   that point, the CE may obtain different values for these prefixes,
   effectively changing to a different 4rd BR.

   Protocol translation described above for MAP-T applies to lw4over6
   multicast translation where the entities involved are lwB4 replaces
   Customer Edge device and lwAFTR replaces BR Figure 2.

4.3.  Learning Multicast Prefixes for IPv4-embedded IPv6 Multicast
      Addresses

   CE can be pre-configured with Multicast Prefix64 of ASM_MPREFIX64 and
   SSM_MPREFIX64 that are supported in their network.  However
   automating this process is also desired.

   A new router advertisement option, a Multicast ASM Translation Prefix
   option, can be defined for this purpose.  The option contains IPv6
   ASM multicast translation prefix, ASM_MPREFIX64.  A new router
   advertisement option, a Multicast SSM Translation Prefix option, can
   be defined for this purpose.  The option contains IPv6 SSM multicast
   prefix translation prefix SSM_MPREFIX64.

   After the host gets the multicast prefixes, when an application in
   the host wishes to join an IPv4 multicast group the host MUST use
   ASM_MPREFIX64 or SSM_MPREFIX64 and then obtain the synthesized IPv6
   group address before sending MLD join message.

   Source-specific multicast (SSM) group membership message payloads in
   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 contain address literals and their translation
   requires another multicast translation prefix option.  IPv4 source
   addresses in IGMPv3 Membership Report message are unicast addresses
   of IPv4 sources and they have to be translated into unicast IPv6
   source addresses in MLDv2 Membership Report message.  A new router
   advertisement option, a Multicast Translation Unicast Prefix option
   can be defined for this purpose.  The option contains IPv6 unicast
   Network-Specific Prefix U_PREFIX64.  The host can be configured by

   its default router using router advertisements containing the
   prefixes [I-D.sarikaya-softwire-6man-raoptions]. 64:ff9b::/96 is the
   global value called well-known prefix that is assigned to U_PREFIX64
   [RFC6052].  Organization specific values called Network-Specific
   Prefixes can also be used.  Since multicast is potentially inter-
   domain, the use of well-known prefix for U_PREFIX64 is recommended.
   DHCP servers can also configure hosts with ASM_MPREFIX64,
   SSM_MPREFIX64 and U_PREFIX64 as in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-multicast-prefix-option].

   Note that U_PREFIX64 is also used in multicast data packet address
   translation.  Source-specific multicast source address in multicast
   data packets coming from SSM sources MUST be translated using
   U_PREFIX64.

4.4.  Supporting IPv4 Multicast at CE Router and lwB4

   When MAP-E CE router is a NAT or NAPT box assigning private IPv4
   addresses to the hosts, IP Multicast requirements for a Network
   Address Translator (NAT) and a Network Address Port Translator (NAPT)
   stated in [RFC5135] apply to IGMP messages and IPv4 multicast data
   packets.  The same applies to lwB4s in lw4over6.

   On receiving multicast data packets, lwB4 or CE router MUST NOT
   modify destination IP address or destination port of the packets.
   Multicast UDP datagrams MUST be forwarded to the local LAN towards
   the host that is a member of this group.

   IGMP membership reports received at lwB4 or CE router may be sent
   upstream individually for any source multicast but for source
   specific multicast, e.g.  IGMPv3, membership reports MUST be sent
   after IGMP aggregation.

5.  Security Considerations

   Multicast control and data message security can be provided by the
   security architecture, mechanisms, and services described in
   [RFC4301], [RFC4302] and [RFC4303].  and in [RFC4607] for source
   specific multicast.

6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.

Appendix A.  Group Membership Message Translation Details

   IGMP Report messages (IGMP type number 0x12 and 0x16, in IGMPv1 and
   IGMPv2 and 0x22 in IGMPv3) are translated into MLD Report messages
   (MLDv1 ICMPv6 type number 0x83 and MLDv2 type number 0x8f).  IGMP
   Query message (IGMP type number 0x11) is translated into MLD Query
   message (ICMPv6 type number 0x82)
   [I-D.perreault-mboned-igmp-mld-translation].

   Destination address in ASM, i.e. IGMPv1, IGMPv2 and MLDv1, is the
   multicast group address so the destination address in IGMP message is
   translated into the destination address in MLD message using
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format].

   Destination address in SSM, i.e. IGMPv3 and MLDv2 is translated as
   follows: it could be all nodes on link, which has the value of
   224.0.0.1 (IGMPv3) and ff02::1 (MLDv2), all routers on link, which
   has the value of 224.0.0.2 (IGMPv3) and ff02::2 (MLDv2), all IGMP/
   MLD-capable routers on link, which has the value of 224.0.0.22
   (IGMPv3) and ff02::16 (MLDv2).

   Source address of MLD message that CE sends is set to link-local IPv6
   address of CE's WAN side interface.  Source address of MLD message
   that BR sends is set to link-local IPv6 address of BR's downstream
   interface.

   Multicast Address or Group Address field in IGMP message payloads is
   translated using [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] as
   described above into the corresponding field in MLD message.

   Source Address in IGMPv3 message payloads is translated using
   U_PREFIX64, the IPv6 unicast prefix to be used by SSM source.
   [RFC6052] defines in Section 2.3 the address translation algorithm of
   embedding an IPv4 source address and obtaining an IPv6 source address
   using a network specific prefix like U_PREFIX64.  At the BR on its
   upstream interface or at the CE on its LAN interface, IPv4 addresses
   are extracted from the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.

   Maximum Response Time (MRT) field in IGMPv2 and IGMPv3 queries are
   translated into Maximum Response Delay (MRD) in MLDv1 and MLDv2
   queries, respectively.  In the corresponding MLD message, MRD is set
   to 100 times the value of MRT.  At the BR on its upstream interface
   or at the CE on its LAN interface, MRT value is obtained by dividing
   MRD into 100 and rounding it to the nearest integer.

   IGMP messages are sent with a Router Alert IPv4 option [RFC2113].
   The translated MLD message are sent with a Router Alert option in a
   Hop-By-Hop IPv6 extension header [RFC2711].  In both cases, 2-octet
   value is set to 0.
