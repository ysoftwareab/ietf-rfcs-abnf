             Signaling Entropy Label Capability Using OSPF
                      draft-ietf-ospf-mpls-elc-01

Abstract

   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a mechanism to load
   balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).  An ingress LSR
   cannot insert ELs for packets going into a given tunnel unless an
   egress LSR has indicated via signaling that it can process ELs on
   that tunnel.  This draft defines a mechanism to signal that
   capability using OSPF.  This mechanism is useful when the label
   advertisement is also done via OSPF.

1.  Introduction

   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a method in
   [RFC6790] to load balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).
   An ingress LSR cannot insert ELs for packets going into a given
   tunnel unless an egress LSR has indicated that it can process ELs on
   that tunnel.  [RFC6790] defines the signaling of this capability
   (a.k.a Entropy Label Capability - ELC) via signaling protocols.
   Recently, mechanisms are being defined to signal labels via link
   state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) such as OSPF
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions] . In such scenario the
   signaling mechanisms defined in [RFC6790] are inadequate.  This draft
   defines a mechanism to signal the ELC using OSPF.  This mechanism is
   useful when the label advertisement is also done via OSPF.  In
   addition, in the cases where stacked LSPs are used for whatever
   reasons (e.g., SPRING-MPLS [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls]),
   it would be useful for ingress LSRs to know each LSR's capability of
   reading the maximum label stack deepth.  This capability, referred to
   as Readable Label Deepth Capability (RLDC) can be used by ingress
   LSRs to determine whether it's necessary to insert an EL for a given
   LSP tunnel in the case where there has already been at least one EL
   in the label stack [I-D.ietf-mpls-spring-entropy-label] . Of course,
   even it has been determined that it's neccessary to insert an EL for

   a given LSP tunnel, if the egress LSR of that LSP tunnel has not yet
   indicated that it can process ELs for that tunnel, the ingress LSR
   MUST NOT include an entropy label for that tunnel as well.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC6790] and [RFC4970].

3.  Advertising ELC Using OSPF

   The OSPF Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA defined in [RFC4970] is
   used by OSPF routers to announce their capabilities.  A new TLV
   within the body of this LSA, called ELC TLV is defined to advertise
   the capability of the router to process the ELs.  It is formatted as
   described in Section 2.1 of [RFC4970].  This TLV is applicable to
   both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  The Type for the ELC TLV needs to be
   assigned by IANA and it has a Length of zero.  The scope of the
   advertisement depends on the application but it is recommended that
   it SHOULD be AS-scoped.

4.  Advertising RLDC Using OSPF

   A new TLV within the body of the OSPF RI LSA, called RLDC TLV is
   defined to advertise the capability of the router to read the maximum
   label stack depth.  It is formatted as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC4970] with a Type code to be assigned by IANA and a Length of
   one.  The Value field is set to the maximum readable label stack
   deepth in the range between 1 to 255.  The scope of the advertisement
   depends on the application but it is RECOMMENDED that it SHOULD be
   domain-wide.  If a router has multiple linecards with different
   capabilities of reading the maximum label stack deepth, the router
   MUST advertise the smallest one in the RLDC TLV.  This TLV is
   applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes a request to IANA to allocate two TLV types from
   the OSPF RI TLVs registry.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security risk.
