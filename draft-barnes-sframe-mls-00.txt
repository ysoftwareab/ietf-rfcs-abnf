    Using Messaging Layer Security (MLS) to Provide Keys for SFrame
                       draft-barnes-sframe-mls-00

Abstract

   Secure Frames (SFrame) defines a compact scheme for encrypting real-
   time media.  In order for SFrame to address cases where media are
   exchanged among many participants (e.g., real-time conferencing), it
   needs to be augmented with a group key management protocol.  The
   Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides continuous group
   authenticated key exchange, allowing a group of participants in a
   media session to authenticate each other and agree on a group key.
   This document defines how the group keys produced by MLS can be used
   with SFrame to secure real-time sessions for groups.

1.  Introduction

   Secure Frames (SFrame) defines a compact scheme for encrypting real-
   time media.  In order for SFrame to address cases where media are
   exchanged among many participants (e.g., real-time conferencing), it
   needs to be augmented with a group key management protocol.  The
   Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol [!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol]
   provides continuous group authenticated key exchange.  MLS provides
   several important security properties [!I-D.ietf-mls-arch]:

   *  Group Key Exchange: All members of the group at a given time know
      a secret key that is inaccessible to parties outside the group.

   *  Authentication of group members: Each member of the group can
      authenticate the other members of the group.

   *  Group Agreement: The members of the group all agree on the
      identities of the participants in the group.

   *  Forward Secrecy: There are protocol events such that if a member's
      state is compromised after the event, group secrets created before
      the event are safe.

Internet-Draft                 MLS-SFrame                  November 2020


   *  Post-compromise Security: There are protocol events such that if a
      member's state is compromised before the event, the group secrets
      created after the event are safe.

   When a real-time session uses MLS as the basis for SFrame keys, these
   security properties apply to real-time media as well.  In the
   remainder of this document, we define how to use the secrets produced
   by MLS to generate the keys required by SFrame.

   [[ OPEN ISSUE: We could define an MLS extension that would provide
   negotiation of SFrame parameters, notably the ciphersuite and the
   value E defined below. ]]

2.  SFrame Key Management

   MLS creates a linear sequence of keys, each of which is shared among
   the members of a group at a given point in time.  When a member joins
   or leaves the group, a new key is produced that is known only to the
   augmented or reduced group.  Each step in the lifetime of the group
   is know as an "epoch", and each member of the group is assigned an
   "index" that is constant for the time they are in the group.

   In SFrame, we derive per-sender "base\_key" values from the group
   secret for an epoch, and use the KID field to signal the epoch and
   sender index.  First, we use the MLS exporter to compute a shared
   SFrame secret for the epoch.

   sframe_epoch_secret = MLS-Exporter("SFrame 10 MLS", "", AEAD.Nk)

   sender_base_key[index] = HKDF-Expand(sframe_epoch_secret,
                              encode_big_endian(index, 4), AEAD.Nk)

   [[ OPEN ISSUE: MLS has its own "secret tree" that provides better
   forward secrecy properties within an epoch.  (This scheme provides
   none.)  An alternative approach would be to re-use the MLS secret
   tree, either directly or as a data structure. ]]

   The Key ID (KID) field in the SFrame header provides the epoch and
   index values that are needed to generate the appropriate key from the
   MLS key schedule.

   KID = (sender_index << E) + (epoch % (1 << E))

   For compactness, do not send the whole epoch number.  Instead, we
   send only its low-order E bits.  The participants in the group MUST
   agree on the value of E for a given session, through some negotiation
   not specified here.

   Note that E effectively defines a re-ordering window, since no more
   than 2^E epoch can be active at a given time.  The better the
   participants are in sync with regard to key roll-over, and the less
   reordering of SFrame-protected payloads by the network, the fewer
   bits of epoch are necessary.

   Receivers MUST be prepared for the epoch counter to roll over,
   removing an old epoch when a new epoch with the same E lower bits is
   introduced.

   [[ OPEN ISSUE: There might be some considerations for new joiners.
   Some trial decryption might be necessary to detect whether you're in
   epoch N or in epoch N + 1 << E. ]]

   Once an SFrame stack has been provisioned with the
   "sframe_epoch_secret" for an epoch, it can compute the required KIDs
   and "sender_base_key" values on demand, as it needs to encrypt/
   decrypt for a given member.

           ...
            |
   Epoch 17 +--+-- index=33 -> KID = 0x211
            |  |
            |  +-- index=51 -> KID = 0x331
            |
            |
   Epoch 16 +--+-- index=2 --> KID = 0x20
            |
            |
   Epoch 15 +--+-- index=3 --> KID = 0x3f
            |  |
            |  +-- index=5 --> KID = 0x5f
            |
            |
   Epoch 14 +--+-- index=3 --> KID = 0x3e
            |  |
            |  +-- index=7 --> KID = 0x7e
            |  |
            |  +-- index=20 -> KID = 0x14e
            |
           ...

   MLS also provides an authenticated signing key pair for each
   participant.  When SFrame uses signatures, these are the keys used to
   generate SFrame signatures.

3.  Security Considerations

   The security properties provided by MLS are discussed in detail in
   [!I-D.ietf-mls-arch] and [!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol].  This document
   extends those guarantees to SFrame.

   It should be noted that the per-sender keys derived here do not
   provide per-sender authentication, since any member of the group
   could derive the same keys (as indeed they must in order to decrypt
   the protected payload).  Per-sender keys are derived only to avoid
   nonce collision among multiple unsynchronized senders.  So the
   authentication limitations of SFrame remain: There is per-sender
   authentication only when signatures are used.  Otherwise, SFrame only
   authenticates membership in the group, and members are free to
   impersonate each other.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
