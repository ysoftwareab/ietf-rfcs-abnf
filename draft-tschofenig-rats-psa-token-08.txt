      Arm's Platform Security Architecture (PSA) Attestation Token
                   draft-tschofenig-rats-psa-token-08

Abstract

   The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is a family of hardware and
   firmware security specifications, as well as open-source reference
   implementations, to help device makers and chip manufacturers build
   best-practice security into products.  Devices that are PSA compliant
   are able to produce attestation tokens as described in this memo,
   which are the basis for a number of different protocols, including
   secure provisioning and network access control.  This document
   specifies the PSA attestation token structure and semantics.

   The PSA attestation token is a profiled Entity Attestation Token
   (EAT).

   This specification describes what claims are used in an attestation
   token generated by PSA compliant systems, how these claims get
   serialized to the wire, and how they are cryptographically protected.

1.  Introduction

   Trusted execution environments are now present in many devices, which
   provide a safe environment to place security sensitive code such as
   cryptography, secure boot, secure storage, and other essential
   security functions.  These security functions are typically exposed
   through a narrow and well-defined interface, and can be used by
   operating system libraries and applications.  Various APIs have been
   developed by Arm as part of the Platform Security Architecture [PSA]
   framework.  This document focuses on the output provided by PSA's
   Initial Attestation API.  Since the tokens are also consumed by
   services outside the device, there is an actual need to ensure
   interoperability.  Interoperability needs are addressed here by
   describing the exact syntax and semantics of the attestation claims,
   and defining the way these claims are encoded and cryptographically
   protected.

   Further details on concepts expressed below can be found in the PSA
   Security Model documentation [PSA-SM].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Glossary

   RoT  Root of Trust, the minimal set of software, hardware and data
      that has to be implicitly trusted in the platform - there is no
      software or hardware at a deeper level that can verify that the
      Root of Trust is authentic and unmodified.  An example of RoT is

      an initial bootloader in ROM, which contains cryptographic
      functions and credentials, running on a specific hardware
      platform.

   SPE  Secure Processing Environment, a platform's processing
      environment for software that provides confidentiality and
      integrity for its runtime state, from software and hardware,
      outside of the SPE.  Contains trusted code and trusted hardware.
      (Equivalent to Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), or "secure
      world".)

   NSPE  Non Secure Processing Environment, the security domain outside
      of the SPE, the Application domain, typically containing the
      application firmware, operating systems, and general hardware.
      (Equivalent to Rich Execution Environment (REE), or "normal
      world".)

3.  PSA Claims

   This section describes the claims to be used in a PSA attestation
   token.

   CDDL [RFC8610] along with text descriptions is used to define each
   claim independent of encoding.  The following CDDL type(s) are reused
   by different claims:

   psa-hash-type = bytes .size 32 / bytes .size 48 / bytes .size 64

3.1.  Caller Claims

3.1.1.  Nonce

   The Nonce claim is used to carry the challenge provided by the caller
   to demonstrate freshness of the generated token.

   The EAT [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] "nonce" (claim key 10) is used.  The
   following constraints apply to the "nonce-type":

   *  The length MUST be either 32, 48, or 64 bytes.

   *  Only a single nonce value is conveyed.  Per [I-D.ietf-rats-eat]
      the array notation is not used for encoding the nonce value.

   This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

   psa-nonce = (
       10 => psa-hash-type
   )

Internet-Draft            PSA Attestation Token               March 2021


3.1.2.  Client ID

   The Client ID claim represents the security domain of the caller.

   In PSA, a security domain is represented by a signed integer whereby
   negative values represent callers from the NSPE and where positive
   IDs represent callers from the SPE.  The value 0 is not permitted.

   For an example definition of client IDs, see the PSA Firmware
   Framework [PSA-FF].

   It is essential that this claim is checked in the verification
   process to ensure that a security domain, i.e., an attestation
   endpoint, cannot spoof a report from another security domain.

   This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

   Note that the CDDL label used to be called arm_psa_partition_id.

   psa-client-id-nspe-type = -2147483648...0
   psa-client-id-spe-type = 1..2147483647

   psa-client-id-type = psa-client-id-nspe-type / psa-client-id-spe-type

   psa-client-id = (
       psa-client-id-key => psa-client-id-type
   )

3.2.  Target Identification Claims

3.2.1.  Instance ID

   The Instance ID claim represents the unique identifier of the Initial
   Attestation Key (IAK).  The full definition is in [PSA-SM].

   The EAT "ueid" (claim key 11) of type RAND is used.  The following
   constraints apply to the "ueid-type":

   *  The length MUST be 33 bytes.

   *  The first byte MUST be 0x01 (RAND) followed by the 32-bytes key
      hash.

   This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

   psa-instance-id-type = bytes .size 33

   psa-instance-id = (
       11 => psa-instance-id-type
   )

3.2.2.  Implementation ID

   The Implementation ID claim uniquely identifies the underlying
   immutable PSA RoT.  A verification service can use this claim to
   locate the details of the verification process.  Such details include
   the implementation's origin and associated certification state.  The
   full definition is in [PSA-SM].

   This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

   psa-implementation-id-type = bytes .size 32

   psa-implementation-id = (
       psa-implementation-id-key => psa-implementation-id-type
   )

3.2.3.  Certification Reference

   The Certification Reference claim is used to link the class of chip
   and PSA RoT of the attesting device to an associated entry in the PSA
   Certification database.  It MUST be represented as a thirteen-digit
   [EAN-13].

   Linking to the PSA Certification entry can still be achieved if this
   claim is not present in the token by making an association at a
   Verifier between the reference value and other token claim values -
   for example, the Implementation ID.

   psa-certification-reference-type = text .regexp "[0-9]{13}"

   psa-certification-reference = (
       ? psa-certification-reference-key =>
           psa-certification-reference-type
   )

3.3.  Target State Claims

Internet-Draft            PSA Attestation Token               March 2021


3.3.1.  Security Lifecycle

   The Security Lifecycle claim represents the current lifecycle state
   of the PSA RoT.  The state is represented by an integer that is
   divided to convey a major state and a minor state.  A major state is
   mandatory and defined by [PSA-SM].  A minor state is optional and
   'IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED'.  The PSA security lifecycle state and
   implementation state are encoded as follows:

   *  version[15:8] - PSA security lifecycle state, and

   *  version[7:0] - IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED state.

   The PSA lifecycle states are illustrated in Figure 1.  For PSA, a
   remote verifier can only trust reports from the PSA RoT when it is in
   SECURED or NON_PSA_ROT_DEBUG major states.

   This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

3.4.  Software Inventory Claims

3.4.1.  Software Components

   The Software Components claim is a list of software components that
   includes all the software loaded by the PSA RoT.  This claim SHALL be
   included in attestation tokens produced by an implementation
   conformant with [PSA-SM].  If the Software Components claim is
   present, then the No Software Measurement claim (Section 3.4.2) MUST
   NOT be present.

   Each entry in the Software Components list describes one software
   component using the attributes described in the following
   subsections.  Unless explicitly stated, the presence of an attribute
   is OPTIONAL.

   Note that, as described in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture], a relying
   party will typically see the result of the verification process from
   the Verifier in form of an attestation result, rather than the
   "naked" PSA token from the attesting endpoint.  Therefore, a relying
   party is not expected to understand the Software Components claim.
   Instead, it is for the Verifier to check this claim against the
   available endorsements and provide an answer in form of an "high
   level" attestation result, which may or may not include the original
   Software Components claim.

3.4.1.1.  Measurement Type

   The Measurement Type attribute (key=1) is short string representing
   the role of this software component.

   The following measurement types MAY be used:

   *  "BL": a Boot Loader

   *  "PRoT": a component of the PSA Root of Trust

   *  "ARoT": a component of the Application Root of Trust

   *  "App": a component of the NSPE application

   *  "TS": a component of a Trusted Subsystem

3.4.1.2.  Measurement Value

   The Measurement Value attribute (key=2) represents a hash of the
   invariant software component in memory at startup time.  The value
   MUST be a cryptographic hash of 256 bits or stronger.

   This attribute MUST be present in a PSA software component.

3.4.1.3.  Version

   The Version attribute (key=4) is the issued software version in the
   form of a text string.  The value of this attribute will correspond
   to the entry in the original signed manifest of the component.

3.4.1.4.  Signer ID

   The Signer ID attribute (key=5) is the hash of a signing authority
   public key for the software component.  The value of this attribute
   will correspond to the entry in the original manifest for the
   component.  This can be used by a verifier to ensure the components
   were signed by an expected trusted source.

   This attribute MUST be present in a PSA software component to be
   compliant with [PSA-SM].

3.4.1.5.  Measurement Description

   The Measurement Description attribute (key=6) is the description of
   the way in which the measurement value of the software component is
   computed.  The value will be a text string containing an abbreviated
   description (or name) of the measurement method which can be used to
   lookup the details of the method in a profile document.  This
   attribute will normally be excluded, unless there was an exception to
   the default measurement described in the profile for a specific
   component.

3.4.2.  No Software Measurements

   In the event that the implementation does not contain any software
   measurements then the Software Components claim Section 3.4.1 can be
   omitted but instead the token MUST include this claim to indicate
   this is a deliberate state.  The value SHOULD be 1.  This claim is
   intended for devices that are not compliant with [PSA-SM].

3.5.  Verification Claims

3.5.1.  Verification Service Indicator

   The Verification Service Indicator claim is a hint used by a relying
   party to locate a validation service for the token.  The value is a
   text string that can be used to locate the service or a URL
   specifying the address of the service.  A verifier may choose to

3.5.2.  Profile Definition

   The Profile Definition claim encodes the unique identifier that
   corresponds to the EAT profile described by this document.  This
   allows a receiver to assign the intended semantics to the rest of the
   claims found in the token.

   The EAT "profile" (claim key 18) is used.  The following constraints
   apply to its type:

   *  The URI encoding MUST be used.

   *  The value MUST be "http://arm.com/psa/2.0.0".

   This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

   See Section 4, for considerations about backwards compatibility with
   previous versions of the PSA attestation token format.

   psa-profile-type = "http://arm.com/psa/2.0.0"

   psa-profile = (
       18 => psa-profile-type
   )

4.  Backwards Compatibility Considerations

   Previous versions of this specification used different claim key
   values for the following claims:

   *  Nonce (claim key -75008);

   *  Instance ID (claim key -75009);

   *  Profile Description (claim key -75000 and value
      "PSA_IOT_PROFILE_1").

   These claim keys have been retired and their use is deprecated.

   Unless compatibility with existing infrastructure is a concern,
   emitters (e.g., devices that implement the PSA Attestation API)
   SHOULD produce tokens with their standard equivalent instead, as
   described in Section 3.1.1, Section 3.2.1 and Section 3.5.2
   respectively.

   To simplify the transition to the token format described in this
   document it is RECOMMENDED that receivers (e.g., PSA Attestation
   Verifiers) accept tokens encoded according to the old profile
   ("PROFILE_IOT_1") as well as to the new profile ("http://arm.com/
   psa/2.0.0"), at least for the time needed to their clients to
   upgrade.

5.  Token Encoding and Signing

   The PSA attestation token is encoded in CBOR [RFC7049] format.  Only
   definite-length string, arrays, and maps are allowed.

   Cryptographic protection is obtained by wrapping the "psa-token" map
   in a COSE Web Token (CWT) [RFC8392].  For asymmetric key algorithms,
   the signature structure MUST be COSE_Sign1.  For symmetric key
   algorithms, the signature structure MUST be COSE_Mac0.

   The CWT CBOR tag (61) is not used.  An application that needs to
   exchange PSA attestation tokens can use the media type defined in
   Section 10.1 or the CoAP Content-Format defined in Section 10.2.

6.  Freshness Model

   The PSA Token supports the freshness models for attestation Evidence
   based on nonces and epoch handles (Section 10.2 and 10.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]) using the "nonce" claim to convey the
   nonce or epoch handle supplied by the Verifier.  No further
   assumption on the specific remote attestation protocol is made.

8.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   This specification re-uses the CWT and the EAT specification.  Hence,
   the security and privacy considerations of those specifications apply
   here as well.

   Since CWTs offer different ways to protect the token, this
   specification profiles those options and allows signatures based on
   use of public key cryptography as well as MAC authentication.  The
   token MUST be signed following the structure of the COSE
   specification [RFC8152].  The COSE type MUST be COSE_Sign1 for public
   key signatures or COSE_Mac0 for MAC authentication.  Note however
   that use of MAC authentication is NOT RECOMMENDED due to the
   associated infrastructure costs for key management and protocol
   complexities.  It may also restrict the ability to interoperate with
   third parties.

   Attestation tokens contain information that may be unique to a device
   and therefore they may allow to single out an individual device for
   tracking purposes.  Implementations that have privacy requirements
   must take appropriate measures to ensure that the token is only used
   to provision anonymous/pseudonym keys.

9.  Verification

   To verify the token, the primary need is to check correct formation
   and signing as for any CWT token.  In addition though, the verifier
   can operate a policy where values of some of the claims in this
   profile can be compared to reference values, registered with the
   verifier for a given deployment, in order to confirm that the device
   is endorsed by the manufacturer supply chain.  The policy may require
   that the relevant claims must have a match to a registered reference
   value.  All claims may be worthy of additional appraisal.  It is
   likely that most deployments would include a policy with appraisal
   for the following claims:

   *  Instance ID - the value of the Instance ID can be used (together
      with the kid in the token COSE header, if present) to assist in
      locating the public key used to verify the token signature.

   *  Implementation ID - the value of the Implementation ID can be used
      to identify the verification requirements of the deployment.

   *  Software Component, Measurement Value - this value can uniquely
      identify a firmware release from the supply chain.  In some cases,
      a verifier may maintain a record for a series of firmware
      releases, being patches to an original baseline release.  A
      verification policy may then allow this value to match any point
      on that release sequence or expect some minimum level of maturity
      related to the sequence.

   *  Software Component, Signer ID - where present in a deployment,
      this could allow a verifier to operate a more general policy than
      that for Measurement Value as above, by allowing a token to
      contain any firmware entries signed by a known Signer ID, without
      checking for a uniquely registered version.

   hypothetical system comprising two measured software components (a
   boot loader and a trusted RTOS).  The attesting device is in a
   lifecycle state Section 3.3.1 of SECURED.  The attestation has been
   requested from a client residing in the SPE:
