     Abstract 

     [RFC4328] and [RFC7139] provide the extensions to the Generalized 
     Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling to control the 
     full set of OTN features including ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU3, ODU4, 
     ODU2e and ODUflex. However, these specifications do not cover 
     additional signal types ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2 mentioned in 
     [G.Sup43]. This draft provides GMPLS signaling extension for these 
     additional signal types.

     1. Introduction 

        [RFC7139] updates the ODU-related portions of [RFC4328] to 
        provide Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-
        TE) extensions to support control for [G.709-v3]. However, it 
        does not cover additional signal types mentioned in [G.Sup43] 
        (ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2). This draft provides GMPLS signaling 
        extension to support these additional signal types mentioned in 
        [G.Sup43].  

     2. RSVP-TE extension for Additional Signal Types 

        [RFC7139] defines the format of Traffic Parameters in OTN-TDM 
        SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC objects. The said traffic 
        parameters have a signal type field. This document defines the

        signal type for ODU1e, ODU3e1 and ODU3e2 as defined in the IANA 
        consideration section.  

         
     3. Security Considerations 

        This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
        above those identified in [RFC7139].  

     4. IANA Considerations  

        This document defines signal type for ODU1e, ODU3e1 and ODU3e2, 
        as follows:  
                  Value     Type 
                  -----     ---- 
                    TBD      ODU1e  (10Gbps Ethernet [GSUP.43]) 
                    TBD      ODU3e1 (40Gbps Ethernet [GSUP.43]) 
                    TBD      ODU3e2 (40Gbps Ethernet [GSUP.43]) 
          
        These signaled types are carried in Traffic Parameters in OTN-
        TDM SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC objects [RFC7139].
