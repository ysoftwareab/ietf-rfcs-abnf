            draft-dai-sfc-fused-protocol-and-mechanism-00

    
Abstract

   This document discusses the protocol extension and procedure that are  
   used to implement the fused service function chain. Fused service 
   function chain means that two or more service function chains are fused 
   to become a single service function chain from the view of data plane 
   and control plane. Fused service function chain is a extension for 
   service function chain.

1.  Introduction

   The delivery of end-to-end services often requires various service
   functions.  These include traditional network service functions such
   as firewalls and traditional IP Network Address Translators (NATs),

   as well as application-specific functions.  The definition and
   instantiation of an ordered set of service functions and subsequent
   "steering" of traffic through them is termed Service Function
   Chaining (SFC).[RFC7665]. [RFC7498] describes the motive for 
   service function chain.

        Figure 1: Architecture of service function chain
   
   There are many application scenarios that can use technologies or 
   methods related to service function chain (see RFC 7665). However, 
   some application scenarios have not yet been covered by RFC 7665. 
   For example, RFC 8459 illustrates an application scenario 
   corresponding to large, geographically dispersed network and SFC 
   for that application scenario is called Hierarchical service 
   function chain.

   Hierarchical service function chain described in RFC 8459 is only 
   one of the application scenarios that have not been covered by 
   RFC 7665. Many other application scenarios that can be enhanced by
   service function chain can't yet be covered by RFC 8459. I_D_fused-
   architecture-and-scenario has illustrated some of the afore-mentioned. 
   application scenarios.

   However, in order to carry out  the fused service function chain, 
   extension for the relevant protocol and new methods or procedure are 
   necessary, and it is the target of this draft.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Overview of the Architecture of Fused Service Function Chain

   As is described in clause 1, there is a need to fuse two or more 
   service fucntion chain to form a single service chain when service

   function chain is applied in some application scenarios. the afore-
   mentioned single service function chain is called fused service   
   function chain (F-SFC). The detailed description about arthitecture 
   for fused service function chain can be seen in [I-D.ietf-sfc-arch
   -fused-sfc].The following is brief introdution for the afore-mentioned
   architecture.

   At first, a F-SFC is composed of two or more service function chains  
   that are logically independent each other and possibly seperate 
   physically. 
       
   Secondly, a F-SFC can be thought as a single service function chain
   from the view of data plane and management plane. That is to say, 
   data packet can be steered through all selected SFs within the F-SFC 
   according to preset configuration. moreover, a F-SFC can be 
   managed by a management entity and the management entity can think 
   the F-SFC as an ordinary service function chain. 

   Thirdly, all service function chains within a F-SFC can still work 
   as an independent service function chain. In other words, if a F-SFC   
   consists of SFC A, SFC B and SFC C, SFCs with the F-SFC such as SFC  
   A can also be used as an independent if it is needed.

   Figure 2: General architecture for fused service function chain

   Figure 2 describes a general architecture of F-SFC. From the figure,   
   it can be learned that the F-SFC is composed of SFC1, SFC2 ... and 
   SFCj. SFC1 consists SF11, SF12 ... and SF1n. SFC2 consists SF21, 
   SF22 ... and SF2m. ... SFCk consists SFk1, SFk2 ... and SFkl. This
   figure can also be seen in  [I-D.ietf-sfc-arch-fused-sfc].

   All SFs within SFC1, SFC2 ... and SFCj can be used by F-SFC. On the 
   one hand, SFs within SFC(i+1) should be used after SFs within SFC(i) 
   in order to keep the logical order of SFCs. On the other hand, SFs 
   within the same SFC should take action based on logical order of the 
   SFC.  

   It is noted that all CFs (Classification Function) in SFC2 ... SFCk 
   can be configurated to work in By-pass mode in order that SFC2 ...  
   SFCk can action based on the result of the CF in SFC1. It is sure all
   CFs can also work in normal mode.        


   3  Protocol Extention for Network Service Header
   
   3.1 The original formation of Network Service Header

   [RFC 8300] specifies the detailed information of Network Service 
   Header (NSH). A typical NSH is composed of the following three parts:

    Base Header:  Provides information about the service header and the
      payload protocol.

    Service Path Header:  Provides path identification and location
      within a service path.

    Context Header:  Carries metadata (i.e., context data) along a
      service path.

   Figure 2 describes the formation of the NSH. The first Row is used
   to describe 'Base Header' meanwhie the second row is used to specify
   'Service Path Header'. The third row is 'Context Header'. There five 
   bits marked 'U' in the Base Header of NSH are not defined in 
   [RFC 8300]. 
     

   3.2 Extension for NSH
   
   At first, in order to carry out a fused service function chain, a 
   certain mechanism should be used to tell components within a SFC 
   whether the packet is bound to a common SFC or a fused SFC.
              
   Because all inforamtion related to a SFC is enveloped in the NSH, 
   some modification should be taken on the NSH when it is needed to 
   classify packets of a Fused SFC from packets of a common SFC. 

   There are the following two solutions to implement the afore-
   mentioned classification funciton:
  
       .Using one of the five unused bits as the F-SFC bit, and the 
   bit is defined as follows:
              
               0: the packet is related to a common SFC.

               1: the packet is related to a fused SFC.

       .Encoding 'Service Path Identifier'.
 
  some numbers are used for F-SFC meanwhile other numbers are used to 
  represent common SFCs.  For example, the packet is bound to a F-SFC  
  when the most significant bit of 'Service Path Identifier' is set, 
  and the other packets are related to a common SFC. 

  It is recommended that the first solution should be used to classify
  the packets of a F-SFC from the packets of a common SFC. And the 
  third bit of the 'Base Header ' is recommended to be used. 

  3.3  SPI in NSH
  
   When a packet related to a F-SFC is sent out from the classifier of 
   the first SFC that belongs to the F-SFC, a NSH will be inserted into
   the packet and the SPI is related to the F-SFC rather than a common 
   SFC within the F-SFC. A common SFC in the F-SFC is called a member 
   SFC of the F-SFC. 


              
Dai, et al.              Expires March 08, 2022                 [Page 6]


INTERNET DRAFT     Protocol extension for fused SFC   September 08, 2021


   

   On the other hand, every member SFC of the F-SFC also has  a    
   corresonding SPI and the SPI of the member SFC is different from SPI 
   of the F-SFC. That will bring some problems to forwarding functions 
   of the SFC components.

   Generally, within every member SFC of a F-SFC, the packet forwarding
   action is based on SPI of the member SFC, though the NSH of the 
   forarded packet envelops the SPI of the F-SFC.

   So, it is needed that some mechnism to be used to realize the 
   function to map from SPI of the F-SFC to SPI of the member SFC. The 
   mapping mechanism of SPI is specified in clause 4.


4  Mapping of SPI

   4.1 Candidate solutions for information exchanging

   If a functional component of SFC wants to map a SPI A to another SPI
   B, it needs to know the SPI pairs(for example, A and B is a SPI pair)
   in advance. Then, the functional component can map SPI A to SPI B or
   map SPI B to SPI A.
  
   There are two solutions for the functional component to get the 
   informaton of SPI pairs:
    
   .Using one central controller to configurate the information about 
   SPI pairs.
              
   .Exchange the information about SPI pairs among functional components
   based on BGP. 

  
   4.2 Central controller based solution
 
   When a central controller can exchange information with all functional 
   components of the SFC that needs the information about the SPI paiirs,
   it is recommended to exchange information about SPI pairs based on the
   central controller.

   In this mode, the information of SPI pairs can be encoded with other 
   configuarion information and sent to those relevant functional 
   components.

INTERNET DRAFT     Protocol extension for fused SFC   September 08, 2021




   Many management protocol or mechanism such as SNMP and Netconf can be
   used to dispatch the configuration information.   

   4.3 BGP based solution

   When there is not a proper central controller that can configurate the
   SPI pairs to all functional components of the SFC that needs the 
   information about the SPI paiirs, it is better to use the BGP based 
   method to exchange information about SPI pairs.
  
   This section specifies how to use BGP extensions to exchange SPI pairs
   among functional components of the SFC.
 
   One feasible solution is using 'BGP Extended Communities Attribute' 
   to envelop the inforamtion of SPI pairs. a new type of BGP extended
   community called SPI-Pairs Extended Community. It is a transitive 
   extended community with type 0x01 and sub-type TBD.

   The format of this extended community is shown in Figure 3.

5.  Actions for SFC components

    Because some changes occur to the protocol, the processing actions 
    of the functional components become different from the common SFC.

    There are three aspects related to the afore-mentioned change of 
    actions that need to be executed by the functional components. 
    The following are those aspects.

       . SPI mapping: two kinds of mapping are as follows:
   
          . Mapping SPI of the F-SFC to SPI of a member SFC when a 
    F-SFC packet enter the member SFC.(A10)

          . Mapping SPI of  a member SFC to SPI of the F-SFC when a 
    F-SFC packet leave the member SFC and will enter another member 
    SFC.(A11).

          . Clearing F-SFC bit when a F-SFC packet enter the member SFC.

          . Setting F-SFC bit when a F-SFC packet leave the member SFC 
    and will enter another member SFC.(A11).(A21)

       . SI processing:

          . Re-initiate SI when a F-SFC packet enter the member SFC.(A30)
   
          . Restore and re-calculate SI when a F-SFC packet leave the 
    member SFC and will enter another member SFC.(A31)

6. Transport layer envelopment for F-SFC

   According to [RFC 8300], an outer transport encapsulation is used
   to forward the packet with a NSH header. And the service header is 
   independent of the transport encapsulation used.

   Because F-SFC is usually applied in cross-domain scenarios, the outer 
   transport layer envelopment should meet the requirement that the packet 
   with the outer transport layer envelopment can be exchange among the 
   domains in which the member SFCs are deployed. 
   

7. Some candidate mechanisms appropriate for fusing member SFCs  

   7.1 Overview of fusing member SFCs
   
   For F-SFC, it is a critical issue to steering the packet from one 
   member SFC to another member SFC. Because network traffic related
   to F-SFC needs to be forwarded domain by domain, problems 
   including security will be brought about when network traffic is 
   transported from a domain to another domain.

   Some mature technologies can help to steer network traffic domain by 
   domain and  avoid possible problems. the next two sections will 
   introduce two candidate mechanisms that can be used for F-SFC. It is
   noted that the other feasible methods are also proper for F-SFC.

  
   7.2 VPN
   
   VPN (Virtual Private Network ) is a good solution to connect different
   member SFCs when member SFCs are set up in different network domains.
   detailed information of VPN can be seen in [RFC 4110] and [RFC 4664].  

   For example, L2 VPN can provide two fundamentally different kinds of 
   Layer 2 VPN service that a service provider could offer to a customer:

     . Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS).
     
     . Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS).

   
   A VPWS is a VPN service that supplies an L2 point-to-point service.
   Then A VPWS is appropriate for F-SFC.

8.  Extension for management/control plane
   
   Functional components in a F-SFC are possibly deployed in different
   Domains, then multi-controllers are possibly needed, figure 7 
   depicts the logical structure for multi-controllers to cooperate in
   F-SFC context.
  
   There is possibly a need for information to be exchanged among the 
   controllers. It is a feasible solution to use BGP extensions to 
   realize the information exchange functions.

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described throughout [RFC7665] and  
   [RFC8300] apply here as well.

   Additionally, when a data packet is forwarded from SFC(i) to 
   SFC(i+1), the path between SFC(i) to SFC(i+1) should provide 
   mechanism to guarantee security of the data packet.
   
   Moreever, when the CF in SFC(i) is by-passed, it should be assured 
   that the bu-passed path has the same security support as the CF.

10.  IANA Considerations

      The IANA is requested to make the assignments for SPI-Pairs
