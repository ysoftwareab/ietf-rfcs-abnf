   1. Introduction
   This draft describes the terminology for benchmarking IGP Route 
   Convergence.  The motivation and applicability for this 
   benchmarking is provided in [1].  The methodology to be used for 
   this benchmarking is described in [2].  The methodology and 
   terminology to be used for benchmarking Route Convergence can be 
   applied to any link-state IGP such as ISIS [3] and OSPF [4].  The 
   data plane is measured to obtain black-box (externally observable)
   convergence benchmarking metrics.  The purpose of this document is 
   to introduce new terms required to complete execution of the IGP 
   Route Convergence Methodology [2].  These terms apply to IPv4 and 
   IPv6 traffic as well as IPv4 and IPv6 IGPs.

   An example of Route Convergence as observed and measured from the 
   data plane is shown in Figure 1.  The graph in Figure 1 shows 
   Forwarding Rate versus Time.  Time 0 on the X-axis is on the far 
   right of the graph.  The components of the graph and metrics are 
   defined in the Term Definitions section.

   2.  Existing definitions
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "June", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [Br97].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the
   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.

   3. Term Definitions
   3.1 Convergence Event
	
	Definition:
	The occurrence of a planned or unplanned action in the network 
	that results in a change in the egress interface of the DUT for 
	routed packets.

	Discussion:
	Convergence Events include link loss, routing protocol session 
	loss, router failure, configuration change, and better next-hop
	learned via a routing protocol.

	Measurement Units:
	N/A

	Issues:	
	None

	See Also:
	Convergence Packet Loss
	Convergence Event Instant

   3.2 Route Convergence

	Definition:
	Recovery from a Convergence Event indicated by the DUT 
	forwarding rate equal to the offered load.

	Discussion:
	Route Convergence is the action of all components of the router 
	being updated with the most recent route change(s) including the 
	RIB and FIB, along with software and hardware tables. Route 
	Convergence can be observed externally by the rerouting of data 
	Traffic to a new egress interface.

	Measurement Units:
	N/A

	Issues:
	None

	See Also:
	Network Convergence
	Full Convergence
  	Convergence Event


   3.3 Network Convergence  

	Definition:
	The completion of updating of all routing tables, including the 
	FIB, in all routers throughout the network.

	Discussion:
	Network Convergence is bounded by the sum of Route Convergence 
	for all routers in the network.  Network Convergence can be 
	determined by recovery of the forwarding rate to equal the offered 
	load, no Stale Forwarding, and no blenders[5][6].

	Measurement Units:
	N/A

	Issues:
	None

	See Also:
	Route Convergence
	Stale Forwarding

   3.4 Full Convergence
	Definition:
	Route Convergence for an entire FIB.

	Discussion:
	When benchmarking convergence it is useful to measure
	the time to converge an entire FIB.  For example,
	a Convergence Event can be produced for an OSPF table of 
        5000 routes so that the time to converge routes 1 through 
        5000 is measured.  Full Convergence is externally observable 
        from the data plane when the forwarding rate on the Next-Best 
        Egress Interface equals the offered load.

	Measurement Units:
	N/A

	Issues:
	None

	See Also:
	Network Convergence
	Route Convergence
  	Convergence Event

   3.5 Convergence Packet Loss

	Definition:
	The amount of packet loss produced by a Convergence Event
	until Route Convergence occurs.

	Discussion:
	Packet loss can be observed as a reduction of forwarded traffic from 
	the maximum forwarding rate.  Convergence Packet Loss include packets 
	that were lost and packets that were delayed due to buffering.  
	Convergence Packet Loss June or June not reach 100%.

	Measurement Units:
	number of packets

	Issues:
	None

   3.6 Convergence Event Instant

	Definition:
	The time instant that a Convergence Event becomes observable in the 
	data plane.

	Discussion:
	Convergence Event Instant is observable from the data 
	plane as the precise time that the device under test begins 
	to exhibit packet loss.  

	Measurement Units:
	hh:mm:ss:uuu

	Issues:	
	None

	See Also:
	Convergence Event
	Convergence Packet Loss
	Convergence Recovery Instant

   3.7 Convergence Recovery Instant

	Definition:
        The time instant that Full Convergence is measured
        and then maintained for an interval of duration equal to 
        the Sustained Forwarding Convergence Time

	Discussion:
	Convergence Recovery Instant is measurable from the data 
	plane as the precise time that the device under test 
	achieves Full Convergence.  

	Measurement Units:
	hh:mm:ss:uuu

	Issues:	
	None

	See Also:
        Sustained Forwarding Convergence Time

   3.8 Rate-Derived Convergence Time
	Definition:
	The amount of time for Convergence Packet Loss to persist upon 
        occurrence of a Convergence Event until occurrence of Route 
        Convergence.   

        Rate-Derived Convergence Time can be measured as the time 
	difference from the Convergence Event Instant to the 
	Convergence Recovery Instant, as shown with Equation 1.
	 
	(eq 1)	Rate-Derived Convergence Time = 
		Convergence Recovery Instant - Convergence Event Instant.  

	Discussion:
	Rate-Derived Convergence Time should be measured at the maximum
	forwarding rate.  Failure to achieve Full Convergence results in 
	a Rate-Derived Convergence Time benchmark of infinity.

	Measurement Units:
	seconds/milliseconds

	Issues:	
	None

	See Also:
	Convergence Packet Loss
	Convergence Recovery Instant
	Convergence Event Instant
	Full Convergence	

   3.9 Convergence Event Transition
	Definition:
	The characteristic of a router in which forwarding rate
	gradually reduces to zero after a Convergence Event.

	Discussion:
	The Convergence Event Transition is best observed for 
	Full Convergence.  The Convergence Event Transition June
	not be linear.

	Measurement Units:
	seconds/milliseconds

	Issues:
	None

	See Also:

	Rate-Derived Convergence Time
	Convergence Packet Loss
	Convergence Recovery Transition

   3.10 Convergence Recovery Transition

	Definition:
	The characteristic of a router in which forwarding rate
	gradually increases to equal the offered load.

	Discussion:
	The Convergence Recovery Transition is best observed for 
	Full Convergence.  The Convergence Event Transition June
	not be linear.

	Measurement Units:
	seconds/milliseconds

	Issues:
	None

	See Also:
	Full Convergence
	Rate-Derived Convergence Time
	Convergence Packet Loss
	Convergence Event Transition

   3.11 Loss-Derived Convergence Time

	Definition:
	The amount of time it takes for Route Convergence to 
	to be achieved as calculated from the Convergence Packet 
	Loss.  Loss-Derived Convergence Time can be calculated 
        from Convergence Packet Loss that occurs due to a 
        Convergence Event and Route Convergence.as shown with 
        Equation 2.  

	(eq 2) Loss-Derived Convergence Time =
		Convergence Packets Loss / Offered Load
		NOTE: Units for this measurement are 
		packets / packets/second = seconds

	Discussion:
	Loss-Derived Convergence Time gives a better than 
	actual result when converging many routes simultaneously.  
	Rate-Derived Convergence Time takes the Convergence Recovery 
	Transition into account, but Loss-Derived Convergence Time 
	ignores the Route Convergence Recovery Transition because 
	it is obtained from the measured Convergence Packet Loss.  
	Ideally, the Convergence Event Transition and Convergence 
       Recovery Transition are instantaneous so that the 
	Rate-Derived Convergence Time = Loss-Derived Convergence Time.
	However, router implementations are less than ideal.
	For these reasons the preferred reporting benchmark for IGP 
	Route Convergence is the Rate-Derived Convergence Time.

	Guidelines for reporting Loss-Derived Convergence Time are 
	provided in [2].

	Issues:
	None

	Convergence Packet Loss

   3.12 Sustained Forwarding Convergence Time

	Definition:
	The amount of time for which Full Convergence is maintained without
        additional packet loss.  

	Discussion:
	The purpose of the Sustained Forwarding Convergence Time is to produce
        Convergence Time benchmarks protected against fluctuation in Forwarding
        Rate after Full Convergence is observed.  The Sustained Forwarding 
        Convergence Time to be used is calculated as shown in Equation 3.
	
        (eq 3)
        Sustained Forwarding Convergence Time = 
        5 x (# routes in FIB) / (Offered Load)

        for which at least one packet per destination MUST be received at 
        the DUT.
        
	Measurement Units:
        seconds or milliseconds

	Issues: None

	See Also:
	Full Convergence
        Convergence Recovery Instant

   3.13 Restoration Convergence Time

	Definition:
	The amount of time for the router under test to restore
	traffic to the original outbound port after recovery from 
	a Convergence Event.

Poretsky, Imhoff								[Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT 	 	Benchmarking Terminology for		February 2005
           	      IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

	Discussion:
	Restoration Convergence Time is the amount of time to 
	Converge back to the original outbound port.  This is achieved 
	by recovering from the Convergence Event, such as restoring 
	the failed link.  Restoration Convergence Time is measured 
	using the Rate-Derived Convergence Time calculation technique, 
	as provided in Equation 1.  It is possible, but not desired 
	to have the Restoration Convergence Time differ from the 
	Rate-Derived Convergence Time.

	Measurement Units:
	seconds or milliseconds
	
	Issues:	
	None	

	See Also:
	Convergence Event
	Rate-Derived Convergence Time


   3.14 Packet Sampling Interval
	Definition:  
	The interval at which the tester (test equipment) polls to make 
	measurements for arriving packet flows.

	Discussion: 
	Metrics measured at the Packet Sampling Interval June include
	Forwarding Rate and Convergence Packet Loss.

	Measurement Units:
	seconds or milliseconds

	Issues:	
	Packet Sampling Interval can influence the Convergence Graph.
	This is particularly true as implementations achieve Full 
	Convergence in less than 1 second.  The Convergence Event 
	Transition and Convergence Recovery Transition can become 
	exaggerated when the Packet Sampling Interval is too long.  
	This will produce a larger than actual Rate-Derived 
	Convergence Time.  The recommended value for configuration 
	of the Packet Sampling Interval is provided in [2].

   3.18 Preferred Egress Interface

	Definition:
	The outbound interface from the DUT for traffic routed to the

	as the Preferred Egress Interface

	Discussion:
	 Next-Best Egress Interface is the egress interface after 
	a Convergence Event.

  3.20 Stale Forwarding
	Definition:
	Forwarding of traffic to route entries that no longer exist 
	or to route entries with next-hops that are no longer preferred.

	Discussion:
	Stale Forwarding can be caused by a Convergence Event and is
	also known as a "black-hole" since it June produce packet loss.
	Stale Forwarding exists until Network Convergence is achieved.
	
	Measurement Units:

   3.21 Nested Convergence Events
	Definition:
        The occurence of Convergence Event while the route table 
        is converging from a prior Convergence Event.  

	Discussion:
	The Convergence Events for a Nested Convergence Events
        MUST occur with different neighbors.  A common 
        observation from a Nested Convergence Event will be 
        the withdrawal of routes from one neighbor while the 
        routes of another neighbor are being installed.

	Issues:
	None

   4. Security Considerations

        Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
        Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking
        is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
        networks.
