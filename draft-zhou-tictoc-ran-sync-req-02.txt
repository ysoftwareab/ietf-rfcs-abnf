1. Introduction

   RAN has its own synchronization requirements whatever its backhaul is
   based on IP/MPLS packet switched networks or TDM/ATM links.
   Besides radio interface synchronization for the NodeB, both Iub and
   Iu have the same synchronization requirements when is based on packet
   network. In this RAN synchronization requirements we give some
   applications description about UTRAN synchronization. Also we list
   synchronization scenarios in UTRAN and give the detail requirements.

2. Applications Description

2.1. Time requirements by Service Applications

   There are many applications in telecommunications that need to know
   the time with great precision. RAN system has to provide precise time
   synchronization, for there would be some services which require great
   precision such as position services, streaming services, etc. In TDD
   mode of 2G/3G systems, in radio interface time synchronization is
   also needed for smooth handover.

2.2. Frequency requirement by Service Applications

   Cellular base stations require highly accurate frequency
   synchronization as reference from which they derive transmission
   frequencies and operational timing however their transport is over
   E1/T1 or PSN, such as Ethernet IP and MPLS. The radio frequencies
   should be accurate. To use radio spectrum efficiently transmission
   frequencies which are allocated to a given base station and its
   neighbors had better not interfere with each other. There is an
   additional requirement derived from the need for smooth handover when
   a mobile station crosses from one cell to another.

3. Synchronization Description and Requirements

   As to RAN synchronization issues, we may say it include "Network
   synchronization" "Node Synchronization" "Transport Channel
   synchronization" "Radio Interface synchronization" "Time Alignment
   Handling" "Uplink synchronization"[1]. Actually when we mention these
   six "Synchronization", we mean different synchronization mechanisms
   in RAN system, and not mean synchronization requirements. AS to RAN
   synchronization requirements, it can be simpler. We could conclude
   into only two kinds of synchronization requirements: network
   synchronization and node synchronization.

Internet-Draft    RAN Synchronization Requirements           July 2009


3.1. Network Synchronization

3.1.1. Synchronization Description

   Network synchronization relates to the distribution of
   synchronization references to the RAN Nodes and the stability of the
   clocks in the RAN. This distribution of synchronization references
   includes the distribution in Iu interface, Iub interface and radio
   interface. To fulfill the distribution of an accurate frequency
   reference to the network elements in the UTRAN, network has to
   provide a synchronization reference with enough frequency accuracy.

   RNC should be able to pick-up synchronization information from Iu
   interface. Synchronization of Iub interface is provided from RNC. The
   clock to be implemented in UTRAN Nodes shall be chosen with
   characteristics that depend on the adopted L1 or L2 medium. For
   example in order to support STM-N interfaces at the RNC, the ITU-T
   Recommendation G.813 (see reference) may be sufficient. But we still
   have some common requirement for RNC.

3.1.2. Minimum Requirements

   The reference frequency accuracy of RNC shall be better than or equal
   to 4.6ppm.When outside reference clock is invalid, system clock of
   RNC should be able to change into Holdover mode. Output of system
   clock should be able to hold original phase and accuracy of 4.6ppm.

   As to Iub and Iu interfaces, different kinds of links and interfaces
   have different synchronization requirement. For E1 interfaces
   frequency accuracy should be better than or equal to 50ppm(see
   reference to ITU-T G.703). For STM-N interfaces frequency accuracy
   should be better than or equal to 4.6ppm see (reference to ITU-T
   G.813). For packet switched network frequency accuracy requirement
   level is not so strict.

   The frequency accuracy of base stations shall be better than or equal
   to 0.05ppm on the radio interface whatever based TDD mode or FDD mode.

3.2. Node Synchronization

3.2.1. Synchronization Description

   Node Synchronization relates to the estimation and compensation of
   timing difference among RAN nodes. Node synchronization includes two
   types: "RNC-NodeB" and "Inter NodeB" Node Synchronization.

Internet-Draft    RAN Synchronization Requirements           July 2009


   "RNC-NodeB" Node Synchronization allows getting knowledge of the
   timing differences between RNC and its NodeBs. When there is some
   position service, "RNC-NodeB" Node Synchronization would be important.

   "Inter NodeB" Node Synchronization aims to achieve a common timing
   reference among NodeB's. The achievement of a common timing reference
   among NodeB's may be used in TDD to support Cell synchronization in
   order to minimize cross-interference.

3.2.2. Minimum Requirements

   As to "RNC-NodeB" Node Synchronization, timing accuracy requirement
   level in packet switched network is not so strict. For example, as to
   Ethernet, accuracy better than 1ms may be sufficient. If position
   service is provided, the requirements of "RNC-NodeB" synchronization
   are to be discussed.

   "Inter NodeB" Node Synchronization in TDD should be better than or
   equal to 3us(3GPP TS 25.123). Base station synchronization accuracy
   is defined as the maximum deviation in frame start times between any
   pair of base stations on the same frequency that have overlapping
   coverage areas.

   If "Inter NodeB" Node Synchronization pick-up radio timing reference
   from external clock reference, such as GPS, then the timing accuracy
   requirement between NodeB and reference clock should be better than
   or equal to 1.5us.

   If "Inter NodeB" Node Synchronization pick-up radio timing reference
   from Iu interface, then the timing accuracy requirement between NodeB
   and reference RNC should be better than or equal to 1.5us.

4. Security Considerations

   Time and frequency services are critical in RAN. Hence time and
   frequency transfer services MUST be protected from being compromised.
   The most significant threat is a false time or frequency server being
   accepted instead of a true one, thus enabling a hacker to bring down
   critical services. Protection mechanisms must be deployed and these
   mechanisms should not degrade the quality of synchronization.

5. IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are required as a result of the publication of this
   document.
