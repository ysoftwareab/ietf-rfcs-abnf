Abstract

The IKEv2 protocol [IKEv2] relies on security algorithms to provide
privacy and authentication between the initiator and responder. There
are many such algorithms available, and two IKEv2 systems cannot
interoperate unless they are using the same algorithms. This document
specifies an initial set of algorithms for registration with IANA, and
specifies which are mandatory to implement. This document also specifies
optional suites of algorithms and attributes that can be used to
simplify the administration of IKEv2.


1. Introduction

This document is a companion to IKEv2. Like most security protocols,
IKEv2 allows users to chose which cryptographic algorithms they want
to use to meet their security needs. Because having choices without any
sensible mandatory-to-implement specifications leads to lack of
interoperability, this document also specifies which algorithms
need to be implemented by systems that conform to the IKEv2
specification.

Implementation experience with IKEv1 [RFC2409] has shown that there are
so many choices for typical system administrators to make that it is
difficult to achieve interoperability without careful pre-agreement.
Because of this, the IPsec Working Group agreed that there should be a
small number of named suites that cover typical security policies. These
suites may be presented in the administrative interface of the IKEv2
system. These suites, often called "UI suites", are optional and do not
prevent implementers from allowing individual selection of the
security algorithms.

1.1 Mandatory security

The must-be-implemented security algorithms listed here are based on
currently-deployed hardware that meets the security requirements of the
vast majority of current IPsec users, and should be useful for at least
a decade according to cryptographic estimates from NIST for business
user scenarios. The should-be-implemented security algorithms are based
on expectations of where the security industry is moving (namely, to the
AES encryption suite) and where more security-conscious users are moving
as current key lengths become more attackable due to the steady lowering
of cost to mount brute-force attacks. An important lesson learned from
IKEv1 is that no system should only implement the mandatory algorithms
and expect them to be the best choice for all customers.

Some of the requirements sections in this document say "It is expected
that in the not-distant future, ...". These statements are based on
discussions in the IPsec Working Group and the larger security
community. Although there is no guarantee that the changes that are said
to be expected will actually happen, IKEv2 implementers should strongly
consider following the advice here so that their implementations have
the best chance of meeting future expected changes.

1.2 Coverage

This document does not specify cryptographic algorithms for IKEv1.
IKEv1 specified its own
values and mandatory-to-implement algorithms. Note, however, that
some of the algorithms in IKEv1 that are listed as mandatory are
considered too weak to use for most security environments.

This document does not specify cryptographic algorithms for IPsec
[RFC2401] when used with manual keying.

1.3 Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. Assigned values

This section lists the values used in IKEv2 for may security algorithms
and functions. These values will be embodied in appropriate registries
at IANA. It is expected that the IANA registries might expand over time
to include values not listed in this document. Implementers of IKEv2
SHOULD NOT rely on the values in this document, but should instead rely
on the values found at IANA.

The algorithms in this section are for IKEv2 transforms, described in
section 3.3.2 of [IKEv2].

2.1 Transform type 1: encryption algorithms

Name                 Number     Defined in

ENCR_3DES             3         RFC 2451
ENCR_RC5              4         RFC 2451
ENCR_IDEA             5         RFC 2451
ENCR_CAST             6         RFC 2451
ENCR_BLOWFISH         7         RFC 2451
ENCR_3IDEA            8         RFC 2451

ENCR_AES_128_CTR     11         draft-ietf-ipsec-ciph-aes-ctr

Values 241-255 are for private use among mutually-consenting parties.

For IKEv2, ENCR_3DES (3) MUST be implemented and ENCR_AES_128_CBC (12)
SHOULD be implemented. It is expected that in the not-distant future,
ENCR_AES_128_CBC (12) will become a MUST-level requirement and that
ENCR_3DES (3) will become a SHOULD-level requirement.

2.2 Transform type 2: pseudo-random functions

Name               Number      Defined In
RESERVED           0
PRF_HMAC_MD5       1           RFC 2104
PRF_HMAC_SHA1      2           RFC 2104
PRF_HMAC_TIGER     3           RFC 2104
PRF_AES128_CBC     4           draft-ietf-ipsec-ciph-aes-cbc

Values 241-255 are for private use among mutually-consenting parties.

For IKEv2, PRF_HMAC_SHA1 (2) MUST be implemented and PRF_AES128_CBC (4)
SHOULD be implemented.

2.3 Transform type 3: integrity algorithm

Name               Number     Defined In
NONE               0
AUTH_HMAC_MD5_96   1          RFC 2403
AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96  2          RFC 2404
AUTH_KPDK_MD5      3          RFC 1826
AUTH_AES_XCBC_96   4          draft-ietf-ipsec-ciph-aes-xcbc-mac

Values 241-255 are for private use among mutually-consenting parties.

For IKEv2, AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96 (2) MUST be implemented and
AUTH_AES_XCBC_96 (5) SHOULD be implemented.

2.4 Transform type 4: Diffie-Hellman group

Name                               Number
NONE                               0
Defined in [IKEv2]                 1 - 5
Defined in [MODP]                  14 - 18
MODP (exponentiation)              201  (w/attributes)
ECP (elliptic curve over GF[P]     202  (w/attributes)
EC2N (elliptic curve over GF[2^N]) 203  (w/attributes)

Values 1-5 are defined in [IKEv2]. Values 14 - 18 are defined in [MODP].
Values 6-200 are reserved to IANA for new MODP, ECP or EC2N groups.
Values 204-255 are for private use among mutually-consenting parties.
Specification of values 201, 202 or 203 allow peers to define a new
Diffie-Hellman group in-line as part of the exchange. Private use of
Values 204-255 are for private use among mutually-consenting parties and
MAY entail complete definition of a group, or may require attributes to
accompany them.

For IKEv2, implementations MUST support 1024-bit MODP (2) and SHOULD
support 2048-bit MODP (14). It is expected that in the not-distant
future, 2048-bit MODP (14) will become a MUST-level requirement and that
1024-bit MODP (2) will become a SHOULD-level requirement.

All implementations of IKEv2 SHOULD include a management facility that
allows specification (by a user or system administrator) of Diffie-
Hellman parameters (the generator, modulus, and exponent lengths and
values) for new DH groups. Implementations SHOULD provide a management
interface through which a user or system administrator can enter these
parameters and the associated transform IDs to enable negotiating such
groups.


3 UI suites

This section lists optional, non-mandatory suites that be presented to
system administrators to ease the burden of choosing among the many
options in IKEv2. These suites cannot cover all of the options that an
administrator needs to select. Instead, the give values for a subset of
the options.

Note that these UI suites are simply collections of values for some
options in IKEv2. Use of UI suites does not change the IKEv2 protocol in
any way. Specifically, the transform substructure in IKEv2 must be used
to give the value for each specified option regardless of whether or not
UI suites are used.

Implementations that use UI suites SHOULD also provide a management
interface for specifying values for individual cryptographic options.
That is, it is unlikely that UI suites are a complete solution for
matching the security policies of many IKEv2 users, and therefore an
interface that gives a more complete set of options should be used
as well.

IKEv2 implementations that use these UI suites SHOULD use the suite
names listed here. IKEv2 implementations SHOULD NOT use names different
than those listed here for suites that are described, and SHOULD NOT use
the names listed here for suites that do not match these values.

Note that the suites listed here are for use of IPsec in virtual private
networks. Other uses of IKEv2 and IPsec will probably want to define
their own suites and give them different names.

Additional suites can be defined by standards-track RFCs. UI suites are
not expected to be registered by IANA.

3.1 Suite "VPN-A"

This suite matches the commonly-used corporate VPN security used in
IKEv1 at the time this document is being written.

Option                Value
IKEv2 transform 1     ENCR_3DES (3)
IKEv2 transform 2     PRF_HMAC_SHA1 (2)
IKEv2 transform 3     AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96 (2)
IKEv2 transform 4     1024-bit MODP (2)
IPsec protocol        ESP without extended sequence numbers
ESP encryption        ENCR_3DES (3)
ESP integrity         AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96 (2)

Rekeying with the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange can occur at any time based
on the wish of either party. The initiator of this exchange MAY include
a new Diffie-Hellman key; if it is included, it MUST be of type 1024-bit
MODP (2). If the initiator of the exchange includes a Diffie-Hellman
key, the responder MUST include a Diffie-Hellman key, and it MUST of
type 1024-bit MODP (2). This means that perfect forward secrecy is
optional for the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, but it has to be supported in
the suite.

3.2 Suite "VPN-B"

This suite is what many people expect the commonly-used corporate VPN
security that will be used within a few years of the time this document
is being written.

Option                Value
IKEv2 transform 1     ENCR_AES_128_CBC (10)
IKEv2 transform 2     PRF_AES128_CBC (4)
IKEv2 transform 3     AUTH_AES_XCBC_96 (4)
IKEv2 transform 4     2048-bit MODP (14)
IPsec protocol        ESP with extended sequence numbers
ESP encryption        ENCR_AES_128_CBC (10)
ESP integrity         AUTH_AES_XCBC_96 (4)

Rekeying with the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange can occur at any time based
on the wish of either party. The initiator of this exchange MAY include
a new Diffie-Hellman key; if it is included, it MUST be of type 2048-bit
MODP (14). If the initiator of the exchange includes a Diffie-Hellman
key, the responder MUST include a Diffie-Hellman key, and it MUST of
type 2048-bit MODP (14). This means that perfect forward secrecy is
optional for the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, but it has to be supported in
the suite.


4. Acknowledgements

Much of the text and ideas in this document came from earlier versions
of the IKEv2 document edited by Charlie Kaufman. Other text and ideas
were contributed by other members of the IPsec Working Group.


5. Security considerations

This document inherits all of the security considerations of the IKEv2
document.

Some of the security options defined in this document may be found in the
future to have properties significantly weaker than those that were
believed at the time this document was produced.


6. IANA considerations

The values in section 2 of this document need to be registered by IANA
in new registries created for IKEv2.

A. Changes from draft-hoffman-ipsec-algorithms-00.txt 

2.1: Removed ENCR_DES_IV32 and ENCR_RC4, which didn't have references,
and renumbered the ones below them. Also added draft names for AES
ciphers.

2.2: Added a reference for PRF_AES128_CBC, but am not sure this is
correct or sufficient.

2.3: Removed DES_MAC because there was no reference for it. Renumbered.
Added reference for AUTH_AES_XCBC_96.

3.1 and 3.2: Added requirements for perfect forward secrecy.

3.2: Updated the IDs because of the renumbering in sections 2.1 and 2.3.
