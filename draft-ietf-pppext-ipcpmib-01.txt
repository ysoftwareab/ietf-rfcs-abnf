          1.  Abstract

          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
          describes managed objects used for managing the IP Network
          Control Protocol on subnetwork interfaces using the family of
          Point-to-Point Protocols[8, 9, 10, 11, & 12].

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          2.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
          three components.  They are:

               RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
               describing and naming objects for the purpose of
               management.  RFC 1212 defines a more concise description
               mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

               RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed
               objects for the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213,
               defines MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I based on
               implementation experience and new operational
               requirements.

               RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
               network access to managed objects.

          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          3.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [3] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
          refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [1]
          purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
          These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.

          The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1
          [4], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the
          SNMP.


          3.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 5 contains the specification of all object types
          contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined
          using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the
          extensions specified in [5,6].

          Internet Draft            PPP/IP MIB                 July 1992


          4.  Overview

          4.1.  Object Selection Criteria

          To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering
          practice, an explicit attempt was made to keep this MIB as
          simple as possible.  This was accomplished by applying the
          following criteria to objects proposed for inclusion:

          (1)  Require objects be essential for either fault or
               configuration management.  In particular, objects for
               which the sole purpose was to debug implementations were
               explicitly excluded from the MIB.

          (2)  Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.

          (3)  Limit the total number of objects.

          (4)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in
               this or other MIBs.


          4.2.  Structure of the PPP

          This section describes the basic model of PPP used in
          developing the PPP MIB. This information should be useful to
          the implementor in understanding some of the basic design
          decisions of the MIB.

          The PPP is not one single protocol but a large family of
          protocols.  Each of these is, in itself, a fairly complex
          protocol.  The PPP protocols may be divided into three rough
          categories:

          Control Protocols
               The Control Protocols are used to control the operation
               of the PPP. The Control Protocols include the Link
               Control Protocol (LCP), the Password Authentication
               Protocol (PAP), the Link Quality Report (LQR), and the
               Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP).

          Network Protocols
               The Network Protocols are used to move the network
               traffic over the PPP interface.  A Network Protocol

          Internet Draft            PPP/IP MIB                 July 1992


               encapsulates the datagrams of a specific higher-layer
               protocol that is using the PPP as a data link.  Note that
               within the context of PPP, the term "Network Protocol"
               does not imply an OSI Layer-3 protocol; for instance,
               there is a Bridging network protocol.

          Network Control Protocols (NCPs)
               The NCPs are used to control the operation of the Network
               Protocols. Generally, each Network Protocol has its own
               Network Control Protocol; thus, the IP Network Protocol
               has its IP Control Protocol, the Bridging Network
               Protocol has its Bridging Network Control Protocol and so
               on.

          This document specifies the objects used in managing one of
          these protocols, namely the IP Network Control Protocol.


          4.3.  MIB Groups

          Objects in this MIB are arranged into several MIB groups.
          Each group is organized as a set of related objects.

          These groups are the basic unit of conformance: if the
          semantics of a group is applicable to an implementation then
          all objects in the group must be implemented.

          The PPP MIB is organized into several MIB Groups, including,
          but not limited to, the following groups:
          o The PPP Link Group
          o The PPP LQR Group
          o The PPP LQR Extensions Group
          o The PPP IP Group
          o The PPP Bridge Group
          o The PPP Security Configuration Group
          o The PPP CHAP Group
          o The PPP PAP Group

          This document specifies the following group:

          The PPP IP Group
               The PPP IP Group contains configuration, status, and
               control variables that apply to the operation of IP over
               PPP.

               Implementation of this group is mandatory for all
               implementations of PPP that support IP over PPP.

          7.  Security Considerations

          The PPP MIB affords the network operator the ability to
          configure and control the PPP links of a particular system,
          including the PPP authentication protocols. This represents a
          security risk.

          These risks are addressed in the following manners:

          (1)  All variables which represent a significant security risk
               are placed in separate, optional, MIB Groups. As the MIB
               Group is the quantum of implementation within a MIB, the
               implementor of the MIB may elect not to implement these
               groups.

          (2)  The implementor may choose to implement the variables
               which present a security risk so that they may not be
               written, i.e., the variables are READ-ONLY. This method
               still presents a security risk, and is not recommended,
               in that the variables, specifically the PPP
               Authentication Protocols' variables, may be easily read.

          (3)  Using the new SNMP administrative framework[13,14], the
               operator can place the variables into MIB views which are
               protected in that the parties which have access to those
               MIB views use authentication and privacy protocols, or
               the operator may elect to make these views not accessible
               to any party.  In order to facilitate this placement, all
               security-related variables are placed in separate MIB
               Tables. This eases the identification of the necessary
               MIB View Subtree.
