Abstract

   Intent Common Information Model (ICIM) defines a unified model for
   expressing different layers' intent whatever role, responsibility,
   knowledge, etc. This document provides an information model to be
   inherited and expanded to construct specific intent model in
   different areas. According to this information model, network intent
   model is put forward which can satisfy users' need in different
   layers, such as, end-users, business developers, and network
   administers.

1  Introduction

   Network operations have traditionally been designed bottom-up
   starting with low level device interfaces designed by protocol
   experts.In order that interfaces could be wildly used by various
   users, information details are exposed as much as possible. It
   enables better control of devices, but leaves huge burden of
   selecting useful information to users without well training. Since
   the north bound interface (NBI) is used by network users, a more
   appropriate design is to express user intent and abstract the network
   from the top down. The intent base NBI expresses what a network
   service consumer (e.g., application, operator) requires from the
   network but it does not completely specify or constrain how that
   service may or should be delivered by the network. The intent is
   expected to be independent of protocols, network interface styles,
   vendor features, media attributes, or any other network
   implementations.

   Intent Common Information Model (ICIM) specifies a generic model for
   expressing key components of intent interface and the relationship
   between these components. This document provides a common model which
   could be inherited from and expanded to construct specific intent
   interface in dedicated areas. According to this information model,
   intent interface in network area can satisfy users' intention in
   different roles, such as, end-users, business developers, network
   administers, etc

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Intent Common Information Model Overview

   Intent Common Information Model aims to specify a unified information
   model which satisfied different areas, scenarios, and other
   constraints. So, it is a complete and detailed information model to
   define the constituent elements of intent. However, not all elements
   need to be present when mapping this model to a specific data model,
   since some of the elements can be obtained by system automatically.

   From the overall perspective, construction elements of intent can be
   described as:

   -user of intent who author and own this intent

   -intent content which is a desired purpose and

INTERNET DRAFT      Intent Common Information Model         May 22, 2015


   -the specific context which is the background circumstance
   information.

   Furthermore, in general, person's intent content usually describes
   the ultimate state of some objects or applies actions to these
   objects. So intent content can be abstracted into further:

   -object which is the target for intent

   -result which is a desired state and 

   -operation which is the specific actions to achieve a purpose.

2.1  Elements

2.1.1  User

   User is an abstract class which specifies the subject and owner to
   express the intent. It is a performance of roles in real world, that
   is, each user serves as a role or a combination of roles actually.
   For example, end-users, business designers, network administrators
   are all instances of User class which act as specific roles. When a
   user is labeled as a role, he will have the desire and requirement to
   express intent belonged to this role. Owning to different network
   abstraction views, intent is different for specific user when this
   information model is applied to specific scenario. 

   Though one user serves as one role in most cases, it is sensible and
   acceptable that one user serves as multiple roles and intent of these
   users may involve more functions and huge operation scope.

2.1.2  Context

   Context is an abstraction class which refers to a set of specific
   background information such as, timer, price, and so on. Context has
   a huge influence on a person designing a detailed  plan or selecting
   the best program to achieve a purpose. For example, when an
   enterprise plans to build a dedicated connection between two sites,
   price and distance will be the context in this scenario. While may
   not be part of how an entity expresses or executes some intent, it is
   a factor that must be considered with the expression of intent.

2.1.3  Object

   Object is an abstract class which refers an abstract class which
   defines some entities affected or managed by intent. For the
   management, users could manage life cycle of the objects through some
   concrete operations, such as, create, update, delete, etc. In
 


Xia, et al.               Expires May 30, 2016                  [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT      Intent Common Information Model         May 22, 2015


   addition, users could use other specific operations to affect the
   behavior of managed objects. For example, a business designer want
   all traffic be filtered by a special firewall. The object of this
   business designers intent could be the all traffic flowing on a
   specific network (e.g. L3VPN), and  this intent impacts the
   forwarding behavior of the traffic network. Object is different in
   specific area. In network area, object is an aggregation class with
   node, connection and flow. For objects, users could construct some
   specific objects to achieve intent, and it is also allowed for users
   to assign intent to existing resources which is physical/virtual
   devices or defined by other ways.

2.1.4  Result

   Result is a type of intent which refers to an final state or
   something an individual wants to achieve. This type of intent shields
   difference and diversity of an environment away from the users'
   intent. The person just describes the final state of objects without
   worrying about how to achieve it. For example, a result could be that
   the company accesses any sites on the Internet safely.  It just
   defines a result that ignores technology details, such as, firewall,
   ACL, and so on.

   In addition to the expecting state, violation is another special
   state which has an important status when achieving integral
   compliance. For example, a typical scenario is that one specific
   tenant does not want his virtual machines to share a some hypervisor
   with other tenants. This type of result just shows the undesired
   state which express users' intent, so this kind of intent should be
   another type of result.

2.1.5  Operation

   Operation is a type of intent which refers to some specific actions
   an individual desires to take for realizing the purpose. This type of
   intent formulates explicit plan to realize a purpose which may take a
   better control of the whole system. According to the diversity of
   system support capability, there are large sets of operations for
   users to take.

   Generally, operations can be divided into two categories. One is
   action without condition. For example, create a virtual machine. This
   kind of operation defines a concrete action which is executed
   immediately without any trigger. The other is action with condition.
   For this kind of operations, condition is a trigger for the action.
   And actions will not be executed immediately until the condition
   clause is tested to be true. For example, "do load balancing when the
   utilization of a link exceeds 80%". In this example, "utilization of
 


Xia, et al.               Expires May 30, 2016                  [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT      Intent Common Information Model         May 22, 2015


   a link > 80%" is the trigger, and "do load balancing" is the action.
   Action will not be executed until the trigger is true. Actions are
   different according to users' role which has different abstraction
   views. And actions will not be detailed configurations in devices,
   but high-level and packaged functions which are translated into
   configurations. For example, the service providers' action "do load
   balancing" is device independent, and network operators' action may
   configure load balance pools depending on specific devices.

2.2  Relationships in ICIM

2.2.1  Relationship between Result and Operation

   Users are free to express their intent, no matter it is an final
   result or specific operations in their mind, but there are some
   relationships between these two basic types of intent. Result refers
   to an ultimate and relatively permanent status, regardless which ways
   to maintain it. However, operations specify what kinds of action need
   to take explicitly, which more focus on temporary or specific
   behavior to achieve some goal. One typical service scenario is that
   all links' utilization should not exceed 80%. By way of Result, the
   intent will be expecting all links' utilizations are smaller than 80%
   (or avoiding any link' utilization exceeds 80%). By way of Operation,
   the intent will be if links' utilization exceeds 80%, redirect some
   flows to other links (or some other actions could achieve this
   goal).

   For result, users just need to express the goal without worrying how
   to implement it in a specific system which allows users to focus on
   real requirement. To achieve the result, it needs some reasoning
   mechanisms to transfer it to real executable operations which are
   supported by specific system. So in a specific scenario, a result can
   generate a set of concrete operations. For the above example, if user
   just expresses the result, that is, all links' utilizations are
   smaller than 80%. The system will choose suitable operations to
   achieve this status automatically, i.e., expand the capacity of links
   whose utilization exceed 80%, or redirect flows to other links whose
   capacities are far less than 80%. 

2.2.2  Relationship between Object and Operation

   Operation refers to some specific actions on some objects, so object
   is the target of an action. In general, any action will include some
   objects to execute this action. When users want to execute some
   actions to achieve goals, they may construct the target objects and
   assign specific actions on them, and it is allowed for users to use
   existing resources to do some operations. Though object is the target
   of action, it offers the constraint for optional operations. For
 


Xia, et al.               Expires May 30, 2016                  [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT      Intent Common Information Model         May 22, 2015


   example, for a virtual machine, the optional operations are create,
   delete, migrate, etc.

2.2.3  Relationship between Object and Result

   Result refers to some final state for some objects. This type of
   intent does not define which specific operations to take, but only
   express the desired state of objects. So it is independent on
   objects' concrete capability. For example, intent is all virtual
   machines' CPU utilization could not exceed 80%. It does not assign
   specific operations. So reasoning mechanism will choose suitable
   operations to satisfy this intent, such as, migrate virtual machine
   or expand it.

2.3  Intent and Policy

   In industry, Policy already has a clear definition, such as in
   RFC3060. Policy rule consists of an event, a set of conditions and a
   set of actions.  When an event occurs, actions will be taken until
   condition clauses are evaluated to be true.

   As mentioned above, intent refers to a purpose in achieving result or
   performing operation. The intent has a larger scope compared with the
   policy since Intent can express both result and operation.  On one
   hand if a result is described by intent, there may be no specific
   action given to show how to achieve this intent. On the other hand,
   if operation described by intent, conditions of action is optional.
   Policy is a specific form of operation in intent. 

2.4  Role-based Intent

   In an integrated system, roles are divided into several categories
   according to the division of work, architecture of system, etc. In
   network system, network abstraction will be quite different in the
   perspective of each role. So intent has strong dependencies on roles.
   Intent expressed by different categories of roles will focus on
   different points and have different intent expression. 

   For example, if an agent is labeled as service provider role, he may
   just care about the high-level services, such as, security
   communication. And if he is labeled as network architecture role, he
   will care about the details of the whole architecture.

3.  Intent Modeling


   This section defines the concept and hierarchy of intent, and
   describes the Intent Common Information Model.

3.1  Notation

   The notation used in this document is adapted from the UML (United
   Modeling Language). We will use the UML for the intent information
   modeling. This section listed symbols that will be used in this
   document for relationships among information models.

   -->

   Stands for the association relationship. Association represents the
   static relationship shared among the objects of two classes.

   --A

   Stands for the aggregation relationship. Aggregation is a variant of
   the "has a" association relationship; aggregation is more specific
   than association. It is an association that represents a part-whole
   or part-of relationship. Aggregation can occur when a class is a
   collection or container of other classes, but the contained classes
   do not have a strong lifecycle dependency on the container. The
   contents of the container are not automatically destroyed when the
   container is.

   --C

   Stands for the composition relationship. Composition is a stronger
   variant of the "has a" association relationship. It is more specific
   than aggregation. Composition usually has a strong lifecycle
   dependency between instances of the container class and instances of
   the contained class. If the container is destroyed, normally every
   instance that it contains is destroyed as well. 

   --G

   Stands for the generalization relationship. The Generalization
   indicates that one of the two related classes (the subclass) is
   considered to be a specialized form of the other (the super type) and
   the super class is considered a 'Generalization' of the subclass. In
   practice, this means that any instance of the subtype is also an
   instance of the super class.


3.2  Intent overview

   In general, intent is one's specific mental activity, so it strongly
   depends on the subject. Different users may have different intent. In
   addition, context, omitted usually, is an important factor when
   achieving purpose, which offers necessary background information to
 


Xia, et al.               Expires May 30, 2016                  [Page 9]

INTERNET DRAFT      Intent Common Information Model         May 22, 2015


   impact the decision. It illustrates the overview of the intent.
   Figure 1 indicates that the user has intent in some context. For
   example, an enterprise wants to block all http traffic in work time.
   In this intent, the user is the enterprise, the intent is to block
   all http traffic in the work hours, and the context includes the
   definition of the "enterprise" and the "work hours".

            +------+  has    +--------+  in    +---------+
            | user +-------->+ intent +------->+ context |
            +------+         +--------+        +---------+

                Figure 1 general prescription for intent

3.3  Top level intent expression

   In Cambridge Dictionaries, the definition of "intent" is the fact
   that you want and plan to do something. So, in general, intent refers
   to an agent's purpose on getting the result or performing some
   specific operation. In specific areas, these results or operations
   will relate to some objects. Figure 2 describes the general
   expression of intent.

                             +----------+                
                             |  intent  |                
                             +-C--A--A--+        
                               |  |  |                   
                   +-----------+  |  +------------+      
                   |              |               |      
               +---+----+     +---+----+    +-----+-----+
               | object |     | result |    | operation |
               +--------+     +--------+    +-----------+

                       Figure 2 intent expression

   One type of intent is to express key operations that a user wants to
   execute. The underlying intent system can generate a complete
   operation list from user's request. The other type of intent is to
   express the result or state without dictating any operations.

   For example, intent of a user may be a result without defining how to
   realize it, such as, requiring security communication between two
   sites, or dictate some detailed operations in order to achieve a
   purpose, such as, filtering all traffics by firewall between these
   two sites.

3.4  Objects in the network 

   Object is an abstraction class which can be inherited from and

   expanded in different area. It, cared about by users, represents the
   target of result and operations. In network area, the object, i.e.
   the target of intent, can be generalized into Node, Connection and
   Flow, as shown in Figure 3.

   The Node represents the functions a network node may provide in a
   network such as network services, forwarding functions (firewall,
   load balancer, virtual router, and others), or a group of network
   elements. A group of network elements can be a subnet, an autonomous
   system, or a confederation of autonomous systems.

   The Connection describes the link resources between two nodes. These
   link resources construct the foundation of communications between
   different nodes. User could take connection as physical link, and
   assign bandwidth on it.

   The Flow refers to the traffic in network which describes data
   packets have some certain common characters. Flow model describes the
   connectivity in virtual network, namely, if users want to describe
   the communications between nodes without direct connection, they have
   to define the flow and assign operation to allow the flow.

3.5  Type of result 

   Result refers to the final state which is expected or avoided. Figure
   4 describes two types of result. Both of the results just show the
   performance of some objects, without caring about how to reach them. 

   Result could be expressed as a set of logic clause connected with
   propositional literals including AND, OR and NOT. The logic clause
   could be described as an expression with relational operators, such
   as equal, greater-than, less-than, belong-to.

   With this model, users could express the desired state as an

   expression. System will resolve the expression and seek ways to make
   it true. The result will be achieved when the expression is evaluated
   to be true. The typical examples are shown as follows:

   - For example, a user may express an intent as the network link
   utilization must less than 80%. This expression is a type of result
   which describes an expected state. The left operand is the
   utilization of all links, the right operand is 80%, and the operator
   is less-than.

   - Another example is an enterprise wants the development team and
   sales team not to share a common link. In this intent, the left
   operand is the union of the link set of development team occupied and
   the link set of sales team occupied. The operation will be equal, and
   the right operator is an empty set.

   Though a unified information model for the Result is proposed in
   here, it is still a preliminary version which just expresses the
   basic components. The formalization and standardization are still
   open issues need to be studied further. More comprehensive and
   detailed manifestations will be added in the next version.

3.6  Operation composition

   Operation refers to some specific actions in order to achieve some
   purposes. An operation must have some actions. However, if condition
   and constraint can be optionally defined in operations, it depends on
   specific scenario and users' requirement. Once a condition is
   involved in operation, actions will not be executed immediately until
   condition is true. In additional, constraint restricts action itself
   or the scope of action. 

   For example, redirect traffic to back-up link when the utilization of
   current link exceeds 80%, except the flow from VIP user. In this
   scenario, the condition is link utilization exceeds 80%, the action
   is redirect traffic, and the constraint is VIP flow could not be
