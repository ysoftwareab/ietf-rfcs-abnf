Internet-Draft                Reason Header                 October 2008


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses terms from [RFC3261].


2.  Overview

   The European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) is defining
   a Next Generation Network (NGN) where a substantial part of it is
   based on the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) defined by the Third-
   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).  IMS is largely based on the
   Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261].

   ETSI has developed a number of requirements to support the usage of
   SIP in Next Generation Networks that interoperate, at the service
   level, with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), the
   Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), the 3GPP IP Multimedia
   Subsystem (IMS), and SIP networks and terminals that implement the
   service logic.

   In order to provide full support in SIP of existing services,
   extensions to SIP are needed.

   This document proposes the use of the Reason header field in
   responses.  This is needed for creating services that must be
   interoperable with the PSTN/ISDN network and the interoperability of
   traversing communications through SIP not using SIP-I.

   The main used case for reason header within responses are
   interworking situations with PSTN/ISDN networks where the ISUP cause
   In many cases the mapping of specific cause values will result in a
   generic SIP Response like it is shown below.

   [RFC3398] and other Interworking specifications like [3GPP.29.163]
   are describing the mapping of ISUP Cause Values to SIP and vice
   versa.  Looking on the specific mapping shows that information will
   be lost when the call traverses ISUP without using SIP-T.

   Example:

   [RFC3398] describes the mapping of following ISUP Causes to 503 and
   408 like follows.

Internet-Draft                Reason Header                 October 2008


      ISUP Cause value                        SIP response
      ----------------                        ------------
      34 no circuit available                 503 Service unavailable
      38 network out of order                 503 Service unavailable
      41 temporary failure                    503 Service unavailable
      42 switching equipment congestion       503 Service unavailable
      47 resource unavailable                 503 Service unavailable
      58 bearer capability not presently      503 Service unavailable
         Available
      88 incompatible destination             503 Service unavailable

      18 no user responding                   408 Request Timeout

   The mapping back is shown as follows:

      Response received                        Cause value in the REL
      -----------------                        ----------------------
      503 Service unavailable                  41 Temporary failure

      408 Request timeout                      102 Recovery on timer
                                                   expiry


   The Example with 503 shows that a couple of different ISUP Cause
   values are interworked to only one SIP response.  With 408 the
   meaning of the release cause is changed when interworked back to
   ISUP.  Also Services built on Cause 18 (e.G. a 2nd call attempt on an
   other number, this service is like a sequential forking) will not
   work.


3.  Requirements

   REQ-1:

   It should be possible to support PSTN-SIP-PSTN scenarios where the
   reason of a call release can be transferred though the SIP domain
   without any loss of information and no change of reason.

   REQ-2:

   It should be possible to provide correct announcements to a SIP user
   based on the reason for call clearing within the PSTN network or the
   PSTN user.  The PSTN does normally not provide announcements to
   originating user when clearing the call.

   REQ-3:

Internet-Draft                Reason Header                 October 2008


   A UA may have the ability to display ISUP specific release causes or
   show a equivalent text.  A inclusion of Q.850 causes is out of scope.

   REQ-4:

   A application server providing specific PSTN like services may have
   the possibility to include ISUP specific release causes

3.1.  Used Cases for the requirements

   REQ-1 shows the scenario between two ISUP Gateways where SIP-I is not
   a solution to be used.  A IMS network defined by 3GPP where SIP-I is
   not part of the framework is such an example.  A used case is shown
   in Figure 2.

   REQ-2 identifies the scenario the gateway passes on the cause and
   some announcement server translates the cause into the appropriate
   announcement.

   REQ-3 excludes that a SIP UA includes Q.850 cause values because that
   is not needed due to the different context of a SIP UA and of course
   the existing SIP response codes.  Also the possibility of displaying
   Q.850 causes should be used very restrictive and is not recommended.
   A used case could be a Integrated Access Device where a POTS Phone is
   connected to.  It is recommended to ignore the cause value if
   received be a UA.

   REQ-4 allows an application server that is providing specific
   Services simulating PSTN services to include Q.850 Causes.  This is
   needed specific for IMS operartors which are substituting their PSTN
   to IMS.  These operators may run Services in the SIP domain that are
   provided to PSTN end users.


4.  Overall Applicability

   The SIP procedures specified in this document are foreseen for
   networks providing simulation services and/or interworking to the
   PSTN/ISDN.

   The document is describing the use of the Reason header in SIP
   responses.  These procedures are only valuable if the reason
   contained in the element "protocol" is "Q.850".  A inclusion of a SIP
   reason (protocol="SIP") is not helpful due to the fact that the
   response already provides the SIP reason.  The Release Causes are
   described within [ETSI_EN300_485].  (Note: The ETSI specifications
   can be downloaded under http://pda.etsi.org/pda/queryform.asp free of
   charge.)

5.  Procedures

5.1.  Procedures at the UA

   A UA that supports the Reason header field can process the Q.850
   Cause Value and display it or an equivalent text.  The inclusion of a
   Reason header field by UA is only for B2B UA interworking with the
   PSTN/ISDN or providing services foreseen.

5.2.  Procedures at a SIP proxy

   SIP proxies that receive a response containing a Reason header field
   is forwarding the response without changing the reason.

   A SIP proxy receiving a request that includes a Reason header field
   can route the request to an application server for further analysis
   and base services on it.

   Based on network policy a Proxy can remove a Reason header field send
   from a UAC.

5.3.  Procedures at an application server

   An application server that receives a SIP request that contains a
   response including a Reason header MAY analyze the SIP Reason and
   base further procedures on this analyses.

   For Example the application server could use the reason for sending a
   announcement towards the originating entity of the session.

   As an example the Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR) service
   defined by ETSI Telecommunications and Internet converged Services
   and Protocols for Advanced Networking (TISPAN)


6.  Procedures at an interworking point with ISUP

   For interoperability reasons the Q.850 Cause Value of a Release shall
   be mapped to the Reason Header.


7.  Example

   Figure 1 shows the example of SIP interworking with the PSTN/ISDN.
   Cause #87 is sent when the connecting user is not member of a Closed
   User Group.

   Figure 2 shows the example where the SIP network is used as transit
   between PSTN/ISDN networks.  This avoids that the Mapping back to the
   Q.850 cause within ISUP change the meaning of the reason for release
   of the call.

   Figure 3 shows the example where the SIP network puts an announcement
   towards the UAB.  The AS sends an announcement with a specific text
   back.  After some Time the Response will be sent back to the UA A and
   closes all open transactions.  With this possibility the SIP user can

8.  Security Considerations

   The presence of the Reason header in a response does not affect the
   treatment of the response.

   Including such a header by an untrusted entity could adulterate the
   reactions of the originating entities.  E.G. sending back a cause
   value "87" can cause an announcement within the PSTN/ISDN saying that
   the call was rejected due to the Closed User Group service.

   Therefore it is RECOMMENDED to include the Reason header information
   in Responses only by trusted entities as it is described within
   [RFC3325].

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes the use of the Reason header field described
   within [RFC3326] .  No additional SIP elements are defined within
   this document.  Therefore, this document does not provide any action
   to IANA.
