1.  Introduction

   TLS [RFC5246] provides a secure transport between two applications.
   It has evolved over the years from its initial specification as SSL
   and has gained facilities as it has done so.  In 2009, a defect was
   found which allowed MITM attacks, a defect which was fixed by
   "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Renegotiation Indication Extension"
   [RFC5746].  In the lengthy discussions on the IETF TLS Working Group
   mailing list that led up to the publication of that document, it
   became apparent that while the concepts of TLS were clear, the
   terminology used to refer to them offered scope for improvement.
   This memo provides a summary of the clarity that was achieved during
   those discussions.

2.  TLS

   TLS runs over a reliable transport - commonly TCP - and provides
   privacy and data integrity.  The TLS handshake protocol negotiates
   security parameters which agree a CipherSuite, which in turn
   specifies methods for key exchange, bulk encryption, MAC and PRF.
   The key exchange generates a MasterSecret and the keys for the
   methods are derived from the MasterSecret in conjunction with random
   values provided by TLS client and server.

   Most key exchange methods require the server to provide an X.509
   certificate and may require the client to provide one, at the behest
   of the server.

   A TLS handshake may omit the key exchange and reuse the MasterSecret
   from a previous handshake on the same or a different transport
   connection; a client requests this by specifying in the handshake the
   SessionID that the server provided as part of an earlier handshake,
   one that generated a MasterSecret.

Internet-Draft               TLS Terminology                  March 2010


3.  Terminology

   o  TLS CipherSuite: specifies a method for each of key exchange, bulk
      encryption, MAC and PRF.  A method may be NULL.

   o  TLS Handshake: a TLS protocol that negotiates security parameters
      for the subsequent transfer of data.

   o  Full Handshake: a TLS Handshake that generates a new SessionID and
      MasterSecret; keys for encryption and MAC are derived from the
      latter.  Where certificates are used as part of the CipherSuite,
      then their exchange forms part of a Full Handshake.

   o  Abbreviated Handshake: a TLS Handshake that omits the key exchange
      and reuses an existing MasterSecret from which the keys for
      encryption and MAC are derived.  An Abbreviated Handshake should
      change the client and server random values and may change TLS
      Version and client certificate.  Note that a strict reading of
      Figure 2 of TLS [RFC5246] would preclude changes to the client
      certificate.

   o  TLS Connection: a transport connection (eg TCP, UDP, DCCP, SCTP)
      over which a TLS Handshake has been successfully performed.  The
      TLS Connection persists until terminated by closure alert messages
      or by termination of the underlying transport.

   o  Initial Handshake: the first TLS Handshake on a TLS Connection.
      This may be a Full Handshake establishing a new SessionID and
      MasterSecret or it may be an Abbreviated Handshake reusing the
      MasterSecret from a Full Handshake on another TLS Connection.

   o  TLS Session: the flow of data on one or more TLS Connections which
      either follows a TLS Handshake that establishes a SessionID and
      MasterSecret or reuses that specific SessionID and MasterSecret.
      The mapping of TLS Sessions to TLS Connections is many-to-many.  A
      single TLS Connection may be serially reused by a number of TLS
      Sessions, each initiated by a TLS Handshake, or a single TLS
      Session may be in use on a number of TLS Connections in parallel,
      or any combination thereof.

   o  TLS Connection States: the current operating parameters of a TLS
      Connection, as defined in TLS [RFC5246] section 6.1.  These
      include the methods currently in use along with their associated
      keys for both read and write, and for both current and pending, a
      total of four states.  The pending state becomes the current state
      with a ChangeCipherSpec message.

Internet-Draft               TLS Terminology                  March 2010


   o  Renegotiation: a TLS Handshake, Full or Abbreviated, that takes
      place on an existing TLS Connection and so takes place under the
      protection provided by the current security parameters of that TLS
      Connection.

   o  TLS Connection Fragment: that part of a TLS Connection which
      starts with a TLS Handshake and ends either immediately prior to a
      further TLS Handshake or with the end of the TLS Connection.  Note
      that this concept, more than most of those covered in this memo,
      does not have any currently accepted term.

   o  Session Resumption: an Abbreviated Handshake.

   o  Secure Channel: a packet, datagram, octet stream connection, or
      sequence of connections between two end-points that affords
      cryptographic integrity and, optionally, confidentiality to data
      exchanged over it.  This definition is taken from "On the Use of
      Channel Bindings to Secure Channels" [RFC5056].  Note that
      implicit in this definition is the requirement that while the
      cryptographic parameters of the channel may change, they must be
      cryptographically bound to their predecessors in order to prevent
      a MITM attack.  Historically, this has not been the case with TLS.

4.  Security Considerations

   This memo introduced no additional security considerations beyond
   those covered in TLS [RFC5246].
