1.  Introduction

   This document defines a mechanism to send a DNS query honoring the
   security researcher Dan Kaminsky, whose online handle was "dakami".
   Dan Kaminsky suddenly passed away in April 2021 at the age of 42.  He
   will be thoroughly missed.

   The "Kaminsky Bug", formally known as CVE-2008-1447, allowed remote
   attackers to spoof DNS traffic that is not protected by DNSSEC via a
   birthday attack that uses in-bailiwick referrals to conduct cache
   poisoning against recursive resolvers, related to insufficient
   randomness of DNS transaction IDs and source ports.

   While Dan Kaminsky was known in the DNS community for his famous bug
   and the coordinated response that followed, he was also a well known
   (white hat) hacker known for encouraging everyone to learn, teach and
   build a better internet for each other.  He has been, and continous
   to be, an inspiration for Internet engineers and hackers world wide.

   Dan Kaminsky has been nominated for the Internet Hall of Fame.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft              The DAKAMI RRTYPE                   May 2021


3.  The DAKAMI Resource Record

   The DAKAMI DNS resource record (RR) is used to honor and remember the
   achievements of security researcher Dan Kaminsky.

   The type value allocated for the DAKAMI RR type is 32767.  The DAKAMI
   RR is class independent.

   The RDATA portion of a DAKAMI resource record contains a string that
   is semantically equivalent to the TXT [RFC1035] record.

4.  Location of the DAKAMAI Record

   There is no fixed location for this RR.  Those who wish to publish
   this RR MAY prefer to place it at their zone's apex.

5.  Example of a DAKAMI Resource Record

   An example string one might use is a single static null terminated
   string consisting of the ascii text "Well Dan, I think you should
   know........".

   This text was spoken by Dan's niece Sarah, in the famous video "Sarah
   on DNS" [SARAH-ON-DNS] which sent an important message about DNS in
   what later would become known as the Kaminsky Bug. It can also be
   seen as the start of a message that the DNS querier is sending to
   Dan.

   The length of this example RDATA is 42 octets, signifying Dan
   Kaminsky's age at the time of his untimely passing as well as
   signifying his quest to always learn more about life, the universe
   and everything.  The number 42 in ASCII also represents the wildcard,
   and Dan Kaminsky definitely came into the IETF on a wildcard.

5.1.  The DAKMAI RDATA Wire Format example

   The example RDATA Wire Format consists of the following hexadecimal
   octets:

      57 65 6c 6c 20 44 61 6e     2c 20 49 20 74 68 69 6e
      6b 20 79 6f 75 20 73 68     6f 75 6c 64 20 6b 6e 6f
      77 2e 2e 2e 2e 2e 2e 2e     2e 00

5.2.  The DAKMAI RDATA Presentation Format example

   The example RDATA Presentation Format, as visible in zone files
   [RFC1035], consists of the following ascii string within double
   quotes:

      Well Dan, I think you should know........

6.  Operational Considerations

   The DAKAMI RR should have no operational impact on the operation of
   the DNS.  The RR SHOULD NOT be added to the Additional Section.  If
   it is added to the Additional Section, it MUST be added as the last
   RR and MUST NOT cause truncation or fragmentation of the DNS
   response.

7.  Security Considerations

   The DAKAMI RR does not alter the security of the DNS.

   Dan Kaminsky considerably improved the security of DNS and the
   internet in general.  His handling of the Kaminsky Bug, together with
   the help of the people at ISC and elsewhere, has raised the standard
   of responsible disclosure.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   The implementation and usage of the DAKAMI RR has no privacy impact
   other than revealing an appreciation for a lifetime of achievements
   by Dan Kaminsky.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new DNS RR type, DAKAMI, whose value 32767
   has been allocated by IANA from the DNS Resource Record (RR) TYPEs
   registry.

10.  Acknowledgements

   Dan Kaminsky, we acknowledge you for a lifetime achievement of
   sharing your technical expertise, for using your knowledge and
   charisma for good, for inspiring and assisting others no matter what
   project they were working on and for always reminding us that how we
   do things is as important as what we do.  May your DNS queries flow
   over the internet for as long as we haven't build something better.
   Thank you Dan, for everything.
