               PIM neighbor reduction for transit LAN's.
                draft-wijnands-pim-neighbor-reduction-01

Abstract

   PIM establishes a neighbor relationship with other routers directly
   connected to it on startup.  Networks that are LANs or behave like a
   LAN, potentially create many PIM neighbors depending on how many
   routers are attached to it.  If such a LAN is also a transit network
   (no directly connected source or receiver), many of the PIM
   procedures don't apply.  This proposal describes a procedure to
   reduce the amount of neighbors established over a transit LAN.

Internet-Draft  PIM neighbor reduction for transit LAN's       July 2010


1.  Introduction

   PIM sends hello messages to discover other PIM enabled routers that
   are directly connected on a particular interface and form a PIM
   neighbor relationship with them.  Various PIM procedures depend on
   having a PIM neighbor elected as Designated Router (DR), like for PIM
   register messages [RFC4601] and processing IGMP reports [RFC4604].
   Most of these procedures are specific to either directly connected
   receivers or senders and do not apply to transit networks.  Networks
   that are LANs or behave like a LAN (Mi-PMSI)
   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] create as many PIM neighbors as there
   are PIM enabled routers directly connected to that LAN.  For networks
   where the sources and/or RPs are only in few locations, which is a
   very typical deployment, it's very likely that many of these PIM
   neighbors are never used as a target in any PIM J/P message.
   Combined with the fact that on transit networks there are no directly
   connected receivers or senders, having a PIM neighbor relationship
   with all the PIM routers over a transit LAN network seems
   unnecessary.  It is however still useful to have a PIM neighbor
   relationship with PIM routers that are used as target in the PIM Join
   or Prune (J/P) messages.  We'll discuss these later in this draft.

   The proposal is to not form unessesary PIM neighbor relations by
   creating PIM neighbors dynamically on demand.  Only PIM routers
   forwarding multicast data or on the path to the RP will be seen as a
   PIM neighbor.  Other PIM routers on that LAN that act as receivers
   will stay passive and not form neighbor relationships.  This will
   significantly reduce the number of PIM neighbors established over a
   LAN network where there are more passive receivers than there are
   senders.  Networks that have directly connected senders and/or
   receivers are outside the scope of this draft.

1.2.  Terminology


2.  Reducing the number of PIM neighbors

   PIM uses a unicast RIB to lookup the path to an upstream router for a
   particular Source or Rendezvous-Point (RP) [RFC4601].  The result of
   that lookup provides a directly connected next-hop that is used as
   the target in a PIM J/P message.  [RFC4601] currently states that
   this next-hop also needs to be a PIM neighbor in order to send a PIM

   J/P to it.  However, whether you're not sending a PIM message because
   it is not a PIM neighbor or this upstream router is unable to parse
   the join, functionally does not make a big difference.  The multicast
   tree can't be formed and traffic is interrupted.  This draft proposes
   to send a PIM J/P to a target upstream router even if it is not a PIM
   neighbor.  We also propose that a router accepts the PIM J/P and
   processes it as if it was received from a PIM neighbor.  In most
   multicast deployments it is very likely that a next-hop for a source
   and an RP is also a PIM enabled router, so this is not considered to
   be a big issue.  However, we do want to form a one-way PIM neighbor
   relationship with the target upstream router.

   If a PIM router has a desire to send a PIM J/P to a non-PIM neighbor
   U, we propose to take one bit out of the PIM Join/Prune header
   'Reserved' range and set it to 1 before we send the J/P packet.  We
   call this bit the 'Hello Request' bit.  A router that receives a PIM
   J/P with the 'Hello Request' bit on, sends a PIM hello out over the
   interface the PIM J/P was received on.  The other routers on the LAN
   will receive the PIM hello and MAY form a one-way PIM neighbor
   relationship with U. A router that receives the Hello from U and has
   no interest in it MAY ignore the Hello to limit the amount of
   neighbor state.  In the next PIM J/P the 'Hello Request' bit will be
   off because the PIM neighbor is known by the router sending the Join.
   Router U will continue to send periodic PIM Hello's out the interface
   as long as there is at least one downstream router joined over that
   interface for either a (*,G) or (S,G) state.


3.  Bidir support

   The support for PIM Bidir [RFC5015] on a LAN depends on the election
   of the Designated Forwarder (DF).  The DF election mechanism has a
   few dependencies on PIM neighbors.  [RFC5015] section 3.5.5 also
   describes a PIM Hello dependency on the DF election.  For that reason
   routers that are bidir capable and a Candidate DF will send out a PIM
   Hello over that LAN.  A PIM neighbor relationship will be established
   among the candidate DF routers.  Note that a candidate DF router on a
   LAN is a router that has an RPF interface towards the RPA that is NOT
   on that same LAN.  Please see [RFC5015] section 2.1 and 3.5.2 for
   details.  It is expected that there are few Candidate DF routers and
   it's very likely these routers are already on the path to the RPA for
   the Sparse-Mode groups.  We don't expect this procedure to add to the
   number of PIM neighbors that is etablished over that LAN.


4.  Generation ID Hello option

   PIM routers may use the generation ID in a PIM hello to make

   downstream router trigger PIM J/P's to it.  This feature is used for
   upstream router High Avalability (HA) and when a router or interface
   becomes active.  Using this feature there is no need to wait for the
   next periodic PIM J/P interval to (re)populate the forwarding state
   on the upstream router.  If a Router or LAN becomes active, it is
   allowed to send a PIM hello on that LAN interface to speed up
   convergence, but it SHOULD not continue to send hello's periodically.
   Note, it's up to the downstream router(s) to either respond to this
   PIM Hello or ignore it if there is no interest in this PIM neighbor.


5.  Hello suppression and options

   PIM includes options in its Hello packets.  We can group these
   options in two categories, options that are significant per neighbor
   or per LAN.  For example, the GenID option is significant to the
   neighbor originating it, the Bidir option is significant to the LAN.
   Options that are significant per neighbor are learned as soon as a
   node has any interest that the neighbor.  For these we don't need any
   special procedures.  However, options relevant to the LAN, like Bidir
   capable or DR priority may not be learned because nodes on the LAN
   may suppress their Hello's using the procedures described in this
   draft.  Its not important to know which nodes on the LAN support it
   or not, is good enough to know that at least one node does not
   support it.  In order to discover the LAN specific options without
   creating PIM hello neighbor relationship between all the nodes we
   introduce the procedure below.

5.1.  PIM suppress Hello option

   We introduce a new PIM hello option called the PIM suppress option
   that is included in Hello's sent on the LAN.  A PIM node on the LAN
   that receives this option in the PIM Hello (and supports it) will
   suppress its Hello if the set of included options match the options
   of this node.  If this node has no interest in the sender of the
   Hello, no PIM neighbor relationship is created.  The option set that
   this PIM neighbor advertised will be stored with an expire timer set
   to the advertised PIM hello holdtime.  If this option set did already
   exist, only the option set expire timer is updated.  The PIM hello
   periodic interval timer is started at the PIM hello interval time
   plus a random delay between 0 and 3 seconds.  After the timer expires
   a PIM Hello is originated, unless a PIM Hello with the same set of
   options was received before the timer expired.  This is similar to
   how PIM Join suppression works.  With these procedures we are
   suppressing PIM hello's that share the same option set.  Its likely
   that the PIM nodes on the LAN have the same option set, or at least
   have a limited set of option combinations.  Below is the proposed PIM
   Hello suppress option encoding;

   Type indicates PIM Hello suppression is supported.


5.2.  Backwards compatibility

   PIM nodes on the LAN that don't understand the suppress capability
   will obviously not suppress their Hello.  They will just ignore the
   capability and create a PIM neighbor relation with the sender.  This
   node does not expect other nodes to suppress their Hello so will
   assume that an upstream neighbor is not enabled with PIM.  This may
   prevent PIM from sending PIM Join/Prunes.  How this situation should
   be handled depends on the PIM implementation.  Some implementations
   deployed in the field already ignore PIM neighbors for sending PIM
   Join/Prunes.  For these implementations no special procedures are
   needed.  Implementations that depend on PIM neighbors may only apply
   Hello suppression if all the PIM nodes on that LAN support the PIM
   suppress option.  We propose the following two options to be
   supported;


      As soon as one PIM node on the LAN does not support the suppress
      option all routers on the LAN will default back to sending
      periodic PIM hello's.  Routers on the LAN continue to include the
      suppress option.  As soon as all the routers on the LAN support
      the suppress option, PIM Hello suppression will be activated.


      PIM hello suppression is always one and will not fall back to
      sending periodic PIM hello's.


6.  Security Considerations

   For securing PIM J/P messages please see the security section in
   [RFC4601].


7.  IANA considerations

   This document requests the reservation of a bit from the PIM Join/
   Prune header reserved field.  This bit field is called 'Hello
   Request' bit.
