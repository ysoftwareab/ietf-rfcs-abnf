       Scalability Considerations for Network Resource Partition
                   draft-dong-teas-nrp-scalability-00

Abstract

   IETF network slice service aims to meet the connectivity demands of a
   network slice customer with specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
   and Service Level Expectations (SLEs) over a common underlay network.
   A Network Resource Partition is a set of network resources that are
   allocated from the underlay network to carry a specific set of
   network traffic and meet the required SLOs and SLEs.  One or multiple
   IETF network slice services can be mapped to one network resource
   partition.

   With the demand for IETF network slice services increases,
   scalability would become an important factor for the large scale
   deployment of IETF network slices.  Although the scalability of IETF
   network slices can be improved by mapping a group of IETF network
   slices to one network resource partition, there are concerns about
   the scalability of network resource partitions.  This document
   describes the scalability considerations about network resource
   partition in the network control plane and data plane, and some
   optimization mechanisms are proposed.

1.  Introduction

   IETF Network Slice service aims to meet the connectivity demands of a
   network slice customer with specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
   and Service Level Expectations (SLEs) over a common underlay network.
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] defines the terminologies and the
   characteristics of IETF network slices.  It also discusses the
   general framework, the components and interfaces for requesting and
   operating IETF network slices.  For the realization of IETF network
   slice services, a concept called network resource partition is
   introduced, which refers to a set of network resources that are
   available in the underlay network to carry traffic and meet the SLOs
   and SLEs.

   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] describes the layered framework and
   candidate technologies for delivering enhanced VPN (VPN+) services.
   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to meet the needs of some customers or
   applications, including the applications that are associated with 5G,
   which requires connectivity services with advanced characteristics,
   such as the assurance of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and specific
   Service Level Expectations (SLEs).  To meet the requirement VPN+
   services, Virtual Transport Networks (VTNs) need to be created, each
   of which has a subset of network resources allocated from the
   physical underlay network and is associated with a logical network
   topology.  VPN+ services can be delivered by mapping one or a group
   of overlay VPNs to the appropriate VTNs as the virtual underlay.  The
   VPN+ framework and technologies could be used for the realization of
   IETF network slice services.  In the context of IETF network slice,
   the network resource partition refers to the resource attributes of a
   VTN.

   With the demand for IETF network slice services increases,
   scalability would become an important factor for the large scale
   deployment of IETF network slices.  Although the scalability of IETF
   network slices can be improved by mapping a group of IETF network
   slices to one network resource partition, there are concerns about
   the scalability of network resource partitions.  This document
   describes the scalability considerations about network resource
   partition in the network control plane and data plane, and some
   optimization mechanisms are proposed.

2.  Network Resource Partition Scalability Requirements

   As described in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], IETF Network
   Slices may be grouped together according to characteristics
   (including SLOs and SLEs).  This grouping allows an operator to host
   a number of slices on a particular set of resources to reduce the
   amount of state information needed in the network.  This can help to
   avoid the maintenance of per IETF network slice state in the underlay
   network.  The amount of network resource partitions needed in the
   network depends on the scenarios of IETF network slices.

   With the development and evolution of 5G and other services, it is
   expected that an increasing number of IETF network slices will be
   deployed.  The number of network slices required depends on how IETF
   network slices will be used, and the progress of network slicing for
   the vertical industrial services.  The potential number of IETF
   network slice services and network resource partitions is analyzed by
   classifying the network slice deployment into three typical
   scenarios:

   1.  IETF network slices can be used by a network operator for
       different types of services.  For example, in a converged multi-
       service network, different IETF network slices can be created to
       carry mobile transport service, fixed broadband service and
       enterprise services respectively, each type of service could be
       managed by a separate department or management team.  Some
       service types, such as multicast service may also be deployed in
       a dedicated network slice.  In this case, a separate network
       resource partition may need to be created for each service type.
       It is also possible that a network infrastructure operator
       provides IETF network slices to other network operators as a
       wholesale service, and a network resource partition may also be
       needed for each wholesale service customer.  In this scenario,
       the number of network resource partitions in a network could be
       relatively small, such as in the order of 10 or so.  This could
       be one of the typical cases in the beginning of IETF network
       slice deployment.

   2.  IETF network slices can be requested by customers in vertical
       industries, where the assurance of SLOs and the fulfilment of
       SLEs are quite important.  At the early stage of the vertical
       industrial services, a few top customers in some industries will
       begin to use IETF network slices to provide performance assurance
       to their business, such as smart grid, manufacturing, public
       safety, on-line gaming, etc.  The realization of such IETF
       network slices typically requires to provide different network
       resource partitions for different industries, and some top
       customers can require dedicated network resource partitions for



Dong, et al.              Expires 20 June 2022                  [Page 4]

       strict service performance guarantee.  Considering the number of
       vertical industries, and the number of top customers in each
       industry, the number of network resource partitions needed may be
       in the order of 100.

   3.  With the evolution of 5G and cloud networks, IETF network slices
       could be widely used by various vertical industrial customers and
       enterprise customers who require guaranteed or predictable
       service performance.  The total amount of IETF network slices may
       increase to thousands or more, although it is expected that the
       number of IETF network slices would still be less than the number
       of traditional VPN services in the network.  Accordingly, the
       number of network resource partitions needed may be in the order
       of 1000.

   As defined by 3GPP [TS23501], a 5G network slice is identified using
   the Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (S-NSSAI),
   which is a 32-bit identifier comprised of 8-bit Slice/Service Type
   (SST) and 24-bit Slice Differentiator (SD).  This allows the mobile
   networks (the RAN and mobile core networks) to support a large number
   of 5G network slices.  Although it is likely that multiple 5G network
   slices are mapped to the same IETF network slice, in some cases the
   number of IETF network slices may be comparable to the number of 5G
   network slices, and the required network resource partitions may
   increase as well.

                   Figure 1. Format of S-NSSAI in 3GPP

   Thus realization of IETF network slices needs to meet the scalability
   requirement of IETF network slice services in different scenarios.
   The increased number of IETF network slice services will introduce
   additional complexity and overhead both to the control plane and the
   data plane, especially in the aspects related to the underlay network
   resource partitions.  Although in many cases multiple IETF network
   slice services can be mapped to the same network resource partition,
   there still can be scalability challenges with the increased number
   of network resource partitions.

3.  Network Resource Partition Scalability Considerations

   In this section, the scalability of Network Resource Partition in the
   control plane and data plane is analyzed to understand the possible
   gaps in meeting the scalability requirement of IETF Network Slices.

3.1.  Control Plane Scalability

   The control plane of network resource partition could be based on the
   hybrid of a centralized controller and the distributed control plane.

3.1.1.  Distributed Control Plane

   For the delivery of IETF network slice services, it is necessary to
   create multiple network resource partitions, each can be associated
   with a customized logical topology.  The network resource attributes
   and the associated logical topology information of each network
   resource partition may need to be exchanged among the network nodes.
   The scalability of the distributed control plane used for the
   distribution of network resource partition information needs to be
   considered in the following aspects:

   *  The number of control protocol instances maintained on each node

   *  The number of protocol sessions maintained on each link

   *  The number of routes advertised by each node

   *  The amount of attributes associated with each route

   *  The number of route computation (i.e.  SPF computation) executed
      by each node

   As the number of network resource partitions increases, it is
   expected that in some of the above aspects, the overhead in the
   control plane may increase dramatically.  For example, the overhead
   of maintaining separated control protocol instances (e.g.  IGP
   instances) for different network resource partitions is considered
   higher than maintaining the information of separated network resource
   partitions in the same control protocol instance with appropriate
   separation, and the overhead of maintaining separate protocol
   sessions for different network resource partitions is considered
   higher than using a shared protocol session for the information
   exchange of multiple network resource partitions.  To meet the
   requirement of the increasing number of network resource partitions,
   It is suggested to choose the control plane mechanisms which could
   improve the scalability while still provide the required
   functionality.

Internet-Draft       NRP Scalability Considerations        December 2021


3.1.2.  Centralized Control Plane

   By introducing the centralized network controller, the SDN approach
   can reduce the amount of control plane overhead in the distributed
   control plane, while it may also transfer some of the scalability
   concerns from network nodes to the centralized controller, thus the
   scalability of the controller also needs to be considered.

   To provide global optimization for the Traffic Engineered (TE) paths
   in different network resource partitions, the controller needs to
   keep the topology and resource information of all the network
   resource partitions up-to-date.  To achieve this, the controller may
   need to maintain a communication channel with each network node in
   the network.  When there is significant change in the network, or
   multiple network resource partitions requires global optimization
   concurrently, there may be a heavy processing burden at the
   controller, and a heavy load in the network surrounding the
   controller for the distribution of the updated network state and the
   TE paths.

3.2.  Data Plane Scalability

   To provide different IETF network slice services with the required
   SLOs and SLEs, it is necessary to allocate different subsets of
   network resources as different network resource partitions to avoid
   or reduce the unexpected interruption.  As the number of network
   resource partitions increases, it is required that the underlying
   network can provide fine-granular network resource partitioning,
   which means the amount of state about the partitioned network
   resources to be maintained on the network nodes will also increase.

   In packet forwarding, IETF network slice service traffic needs to be
   processed according to the topology and resource attributes of the
   network resource partition it mapped to, this means that some fields
   in the data packet needs to be used to identify the network resource
   partition and its associated topology either directly or implicitly.
   Different approaches of encapsulating the network resource partition
   information in data packet can have different scalability
   implications.

   One practical approach is to reuse some of the existing fields in the
   data packet to additionally identify the network resource partition
   the packet belongs to.  For example, the destination IP addresses or
   the MPLS forwarding labels may be reused to further identify the
   network resource partition.  This can avoid the cost of introducing
   new fields in the data packet, while since it introduces additional
   semantics to the existing fields, the processing of the existing
   fields in packet forwarding may need to be changed.  Moreover,



Dong, et al.              Expires 20 June 2022                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       NRP Scalability Considerations        December 2021


   introducing resource semantics to existing identifiers in the packet
   (e.g.  IP addresses, MPLS forwarding labels, etc.) may result in the
   increase of the amount of the existing IDs in proportion to the
   number of the network resource partitions, which may cause
   scalability problem in networks where a relatively large number of
   network resource partitions is needed.

   An alternative approach is to introduce a new dedicated field in the
   data packet for identifying the network resource partition.  This
   could avoid the impacts to the existing fields in the packet.  And if
   this new field carries a global-significant network resource
   partition identifier, it could be used together with the existing
   fields to determine the packet forwarding behavior.  The potential
   issue with this approach is the difficulty in introducing a new field
   in some of the data plane technologies.

   In addition, the introduction of network resource partition specific
   packet forwarding has impact on the scalability of the forwarding
   entries on network nodes, as a network node may need to maintain
   separate forwarding entries for each network resource partition it
   participates in.

3.3.  Gap Analysis of Existing Mechanisms

   One candidate mechanism to build network resource partition is to use
   resource aware Segment Identifiers (either SR-MPLS or SRv6) in the
   data plane as described in [I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments]
   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn], and distribute the resource
   attribute and the associated logical topology of each network
   resource partition based on either Multi-topology
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-sr-vtn-mt], Flex-Algo
   [I-D.zhu-lsr-isis-sr-vtn-flexalgo] or the combination of these
   mechanisms in the control plane.  This mechanism is suitable for
   networks where a small number of network resource partitions are
   needed.  As the number of network resource partitions increases,
   there may be several scalability challenges with this approach:

   1.  The number of SR SIDs needed will increase in proportion to the
       number of network resource partitions in the network, which will
       bring challenges both to the distribution of SIDs and the related
       information in the control plane, and to the installation of
       forwarding entries for resource aware SIDs in the data plane.

   2.  The number of route computation (e.g.  SPF computation) will
       increase in proportion to the number of network resource
       partitions in the network, which may introduce significant
       overhead to the control plane of network nodes.

Internet-Draft       NRP Scalability Considerations        December 2021


   3.  The maximum number of logical topologies supported by OSPF is
       128, and the maximum number of Flex-Algo is 128, which may not
       meet the required number of network resource partitions in some
       network scenarios.

4.  Proposed Scalability Optimizations


4.1.  Control Plane Optimizations

   For the distributed control plane, several optimizations can be
   considered to reduce the control plane overhead and improve the
   control plane scalability.

   The first optimization mechanism is to reduce the amount of control
   plane sessions used for the establishment and maintenance of the
   network resource partitions.  For multiple network resource
   partitions which have the same connection relationship between two
   adjacent network nodes, it is proposed that one single control
   protocol session is used for such group of network resource
   partitions.  The information of different network resource partitions
   can be exchanged over the same session, with necessary identification
   information to distinguish the network resource partitions in the
   control message.  This could reduce the overhead of maintaining a
   large number of separate control protocol sessions for each network
   resource partition, and could also reduce the amount of control plane
   messages flooded in the network.

   The second optimization mechanism is to decouple the network resource
   partition information from the associated logical topology
   information in the control plane, so that the resource attributes and
   the topology attributes can be advertised and processed separately.
   In a network, it is possible that multiple network resource
   partitions associate with the same logical topology, and multiple
   network resource partitions may share the same set of network
   resources on a subset of network nodes and links.  Then it is more
   efficient if only one copy of the topology information is advertised,
   and multiple network resource partitions sharing the same topology
   could refer to this topology information.  More importantly, with
   this approach, the result of topology-based route computation could
   be shared by multiple network resource partitions, so that the
   overhead of per network resource partition route computation could be
   avoided.  Similarly, information of a subset of network resources
   reserved on a particular network node or link could be advertised
   once and may be referred to by multiple network resource partitions
   which share the same set of resources.

   attributes of each network resource partition are different.  In this
   case, only one copy of the network topology information needs to be
   advertised, and the topology-based route computation result can be
   shared by the two network resource partitions to generate the
   corresponding routing and forwarding tables.

   Figure 3 gives another example of two network resource partitions
   which share the same set of network resources on some of the links.
   In this case, information about the resources allocated on each link
   only needs to be advertised once, then both NRP-1 and NRP-2 could
   refer to the reserved link resource for constraint based path
   computation.

   For the optimization of the centralized control plane, it is
   suggested that the centralized controller is used as a complementary
   mechanism to the distributed control plane rather than a replacement,
   so that the workload for network resource partition specific path
   computation in control plane could be shared by both the centralized
   controller and the network nodes, and the scalability of both systems
   could be improved.

4.2.  Data Plane Optimizations

   To support more IETF network slice services while keeping the amount
   of data plane state at a reasonable scale, one typical approach is to
   classify a set of IETF network slice services which have similar
   service characteristics and performance requirements into a group,
   and such group of IETF network slice services are mapped to one
   network resource partition, which is allocated with an aggregated set
   of network resources and the union of the required logical topologies
   to meet the service requirement of the whole group of IETF network
   slice services.  Different groups of IETF network slice services can
   be mapped to different network resource partitions with different set
   of network resources allocated from the underlay network.  With
   appropriate grouping of IETF network slice services, a reasonable
   number of network resource partitions with network resources
   reservation and aggregation could still meet the IETF network slice
   service requirements.

   Another optimization in the data plane is to decouple the identifiers
   used for topology-based forwarding and the identifier used for the
   resource-specific processing introduced by network resource
   partition.  One possible mechanism is to introduce a dedicated
   Network Resource Partition Identifier (NRP-ID) in the packet header
   to uniquely identify the set of local network resources allocated to
   a network resource partition on each network node for the processing
   and forwarding of the received packets.  Then the existing
   identifiers in the packet header used for topology based forwarding
   (e.g. the destination IP address, MPLS forwarding labels) are kept
   unchanged.  The benefit is the amount of the existing topology-
   specific identifiers will not be impacted by the increasing number of
   network resource partitions.  Since this new NRP-ID field will be
   used together with other existing fields to determine the packet
   forwarding behavior, this may require network nodes to support a

   hierarchical forwarding table in data plane.  Figure 4 shows the
   concept of using different data plane identifiers for topology-
   specific and resource-specific packet forwarding and processing
   respectively.

    Figure 4. Decoupled Topology and Resource Identifiers in data packet

   In an IPv6 [RFC8200] based network, this could be achieved by
   introducing a dedicated field in either the IPv6 fixed header or the
   extension headers to carry the NRP-ID for the resource-specific
   forwarding, while keeping the destination IP address field used for
   routing towards the destination prefix in the corresponding topology.
   Note that the NRP-ID needs to be parsed by every node along the path
   which is capable of network resource partition aware forwarding.
   [I-D.dong-6man-enhanced-vpn-vtn-id] introduces the mechanism of
   carrying the VTN resource ID (which is equivalent to NRP-ID in the
   context of network slicing) in IPv6 Hop-by-Hop extension header.

   In an MPLS [RFC3032] based network, this may be achieved by
   introducing a dedicated NRP-ID either in the MPLS label stack or
   following the MPLS label stack.  This way, the existing MPLS
   forwarding labels are used for topology-specific packet forwarding
   towards the destination node, and the NRP-ID is used to determine the
   set of network resources for packet processing.  This requires that
   both the forwarding label and the NRP-ID be parsed by nodes along the
   forwarding path of the packet, and the forwarding behavior may depend
   on the position of the NRP-ID in the packet.  The detailed extensions
   to MPLS data plane are out of the scope of this document.

5.  Solution Evolution for Improved Scalability

   Based on the analysis in this document, the control plane and data
   plane for network resource partition needs to evolve to support the
   increasing number of IETF network slice services and the increasing
   number of network resource partitions in the network.

Internet-Draft       NRP Scalability Considerations        December 2021


   At the first step, by introducing resource-awareness to segment
   routing SIDs [I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments], and using
   Multi-Topology or Flex-Algo as the control plane mechanism to define
   the logical topology, it could provide a solution for building a
   limited number of network resource partitions in the network, and can
   meet the requirement of a relatively small number of IETF network
   slice services.  This mechanism is called the basic SR based NRP.

   As the required number of IETF network slice services increases, more
   network resource partitions may be needed, then the control plane
   scalability could be improved by decoupling the topology attribute
   from the resource attribute, so that multiple network resource
   partitions could share the same topology or resource attribute to
   reduce the control plane and data plane overhead.  The data plane can
   still be based on the resource-aware SIDs.  This mechanism is called
   the scalable SR based NRP.  Both the basic and the scalable SR based
   NRP mechanisms are described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn].

   When the data plane scalability becomes a concern, a dedicated NRP-ID
   can be introduced in the data packet to decouple the resource-
   specific identifiers from the topology-specific identifiers in the
   data plane, this could help to reduce the number of IP addresses or
   SR SIDs needed to support a large number of network resource
   partitions.  This mechanism is called the NRP-ID based mechanism.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the scalability considerations about the
   network control plane and data plane of network resource partitions
   in the realization of IETF network slice services, and proposes the
   mechanisms for scalability optimization.  The security considerations
   in[I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] and
   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] applies to this document.
