                   draft-vgovindan-l2vpn-evpn-bfd-01


Abstract

   This document proposes a proactive, in-band network OAM mechanism to
   detect connectivity faults that affect unicast and multi-destination
   paths in an EVPN network. The multi-destination paths are used by
   Broadcast, unknown Unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic. The
   mechanisms proposed in the draft use the principles of the widely
   adopted Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol.

INTERNET DRAFT     Proactive fault detection in EVPN   February 14, 2014


   [EVPN]. This document proposes mechanisms for proactive fault
   detection at the network OAM layer of EVPN. These mechanisms could
   either be deployed for periodic and proactive monitoring, or be
   triggered by specific events to aid troubleshooting. EVPN fault
   detection mechanisms need to consider unicast and BUM traffic
   separately since they map to different FECs in EVPN. Since BUM
   traffic can be transported using MP2P or P2MP tunnels, this document
   proposes slightly different fault detection mechanisms to suit each
   type using the principles of BFD over MPLS LSPs [BFD-MPLS] and Point-
   to-multipoint BFD[P2MPBFD]. Please note that this document uses the
   term EVPN loosely to include [EVPN], [PBB-EVPN] as well as [TRILL-
   EVPN].

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2 Motivation for running BFD at the network layer of EVPN

   The choice of running BFD at the network layer of the OAM model for
   EVPN [EVPNOAM] was made after considering the following:

      o In addition to detecting link failures in the EVPN network, BFD
   sessions at the network layer can be used to monitor the successful
   programming of labels used for setting up MP2P and P2MP EVPN tunnels
   transporting Unicast and BUM traffic. The scope of reachability
   detection covers the ingress and the egress EVPN PE nodes and the
   network connecting them.

      o Monitoring a representative set of path(s) or a particular path
   among the multiple paths available between two EVPN PE nodes could be
   done by exercising the entropy labels when they are used. However
   paths that cannot be realized by entropy variations cannot be
   monitored. Fault monitoring requirements outlined by [EVPNOAM] are
   addressed by the mechanisms proposed by this draft.

      Successful establishment and maintenance of BFD sessions between
   EVPN PE nodes does not fully guarantee that the EVPN service is
   functioning.  For example, an egress EVPN-PE can understand the EVPN
   label but could switch data to incorrect interface.  However, once
   BFD sessions in the EVPN Network Layer reach UP state, it does
   provide additional confidence that data transported using those
   tunnels will reach the expected egress node.  When BFD sessions in
   the EVPN Network Layer exits UP state, it provides additional
   confidence that data transported using those tunnels will not reach
   the expected egress node.

2.  Scope of fault detection mechanisms proposed in this document

   This section proposes proactive fault detection using BFD mechanisms
   for:

     a. BUM traffic using MP2P tunnels (ingress replication).
     b. BUM traffic using P2MP tunnels (LSM).
     c. Unicast traffic

     This specification describes procedures only for BFD asynchronous
     mode.  BFD demand mode is outside the scope of this specification. 
     Further, the use of the  Echo function is outside the scope of this
     specification.

     The approach takes advantage of the inclusive multicast route used
     in EVPN to advertise the multi-destination FEC for bootstrapping
     the BFD sessions. Earlier approaches for P2MP BFD [MPLSCVBFD] have
     used periodic MPLS ping requests to bootstrap P2MP BFD sessions
     over MPLS. 


2.1 Fault Detection of BUM traffic using ingress replication (MP2P)

     Ingress replication uses separate MP2P tunnels for transporting BUM
     traffic from the ingress PE (head) to a set of one or more egress
     PEs (tails). The fault detection mechanism proposed by this
     document takes advantage of the fact that a unique copy is  made by
     the head for each tail. Another key aspect to be considered in EVPN
     is the advertisement of the inclusive multicast route. The BUM
     traffic flows from a head node to a particular tail only after the
     head receives the inclusive multicast route containing the BUM EVPN
     label (downstream allocated) corresponding to the MP2P tunnel. 

     Note that once the BFD session for the EVPN BUM label is UP, either
     end of the BFD session MUST NOT change  the local discriminator
     values of the BFD Control packets it generates, unless it first
     brings down the session as specified in [BFD-MPLS]. 

2.1.1 Bootstrapping BFD sessions at the head of the MP2P tunnel

     To simplify BFD session de-multiplexing, we take advantage of the
     fact that the head replicates a BUM packet for each tail by using
     unique sets of discriminators in each copy of the (replicated) BFD
     packet. These discriminators MUST be exchanged out-of-band using
     MPLS ping [BFD-MPLS] before the start of the BFD session between
     the head and the tail node(s). The head PE performing ingress
     replication MUST initiate an LSP ping using the inclusive multicast
     FEC [EVPNPING] upon receiving an inclusive multicast route from a

     tail to bootstrap the BFD session. This MPLS ping MUST include the
     BFD TLV specified in [BFD-MPLS].  

     There could exist multiple BFD sessions between a head of the
     multi-destination tunnel and an individual tail due to the usage of
     entropy labels [MPLSEL] for an inclusive multicast FEC. For fine-
     grained fault detection, a BFD session MAY be bootstrapped to
     monitor all unique path(s) that can be realized using entropy
     labels between a head and a given tail. However, the path(s) MUST
     be monitored using at least one or more number of representative
     BFD session(s) to satisfy the fault monitoring requirements
     [EVPNOAM].

2.1.2 Bootstrapping BFD sessions at the tail nodes of the MP2P tunnel

     The tail nodes MUST bootstrap a BFD session based on the incoming
     MPLS ping initiated by the head [P2MPBFD]. At the tail node, a new
     BFD discriminator MUST be allocated for each unique combination of
     the source IP and the attributes of the <inclusive multicast FEC,
     BUM label> when a MPLS ping initiated from the head is received. A
     tail node SHOULD include the entropy label, if present to support
     monitoring of specific paths or all realizable paths. 

2.2 Fault Detection of BUM traffic using P2MP tunnels (LSM)

     The case of using P2MP tunnels for distributing BUM traffic
     presents a different challenge for using BFD. Clearly, the yourDisc
     of the BFD packet MUST be zero [P2MPBFD] as the packet is multicast
     from the root unlike ingress replication where individual copies
     are made from the head. However the MPLS label that identifies the
     P-Tunnel [EVPN] used for forwarding the multi-destination traffic
     provides a convenient method of identifying the source and the FEC
     (multi-destination tree) being tracked by the BFD session. The
     tails of the multi-destination tree MUST use the MPLS label
     identifying the P-tunnel to de-multiplex the BFD packet. In the
     case of Aggregate Inclusive trees, where the root of the multi-
     destination tree reuses the same LSP label for traffic of various
     EVIs, the tail node MUST use the MPLS labels of the P-Tunnel and
     the upstream assigned label which the PE has bound uniquely to the
     EVI. The myDisc of the BFD packet is filled with an unique value
     allocated by the root to identify the multi-path session. 


2.2.1 Bootstrapping BFD sessions at the root of the P2MP tunnel

     The P2MP BFD sessions MUST be bootstrapped at the head [P2MPBFD] as
     soon as there is one receiver for the MDT traffic.

INTERNET DRAFT     Proactive fault detection in EVPN   February 14, 2014


2.2.2 Bootstrapping BFD sessions at the tail nodes of the P2MP tunnel

     The P2MP BFD sessions MUST be bootstrapped at the tail upon
     reception of the P2MP BFD packets from the head. The tail MUST use
     the P2MP MDT label to de-multiplex the incoming BFD packet. The BFD
     session MAY be destroyed immediately upon leaving Up state. 

2.3 Fault Detection of unicast traffic

     The mechanisms specified in BFD for MPLS LSPs [BFD-MPLS] can be
     applied to bootstrap and maintain BFD sessions for unicast EVPN
     traffic. The discriminators required for de-multiplexing the BFD
     sessions MUST be exchanged using MPLS ping specifying the Unicast
     EVPN FEC [EVPNPING] before starting the BFD session. This is needed
     since the MPLS label stack does not contain enough information to
     disambiguate the sender of the packet. The usage of MPLS entropy
     labels take care of addressing the requirement of monitoring faults
     of the various paths of the multi-path server layer network
     [MPLSEL]. Each unique realizable path between the participating PE
     routers MAY be monitored separately when entropy labels are used.
     Alternately, all paths MUST be tracked by at least one or a fewer
     number of representative BFD session(s) in which case the
     granularity of fault-detection would be coarser. The PE node
     receiving the MPLS ping MUST allocate one BFD discriminator for
     every unique combination of the source IP address and the tuple of
     <unicast FEC, EVPN label>. A node SHOULD include the entropy
     label,if present to satisfy the requirement of fault monitoring of
     specific paths or all realizable paths. Note that once the BFD
     session for the EVPN label is UP, either end of the BFD session
     MUST NOT change  the local discriminator values of the BFD Control
     packets it generates, unless it first brings down the session as
     specified in [BFD-MPLS]. 

3 BFD packet encapsulation

3.1 Using GAL/G-ACh encapsulation without IP headers

3.1.1 Ingress replication

     The packet contains the following labels: LSP label (transport)
     when not using PHP, the optional entropy label, the BUM label and
     the SH label[EVPN] (where applicable). The G-ACh type is set to
     TBD. The discriminator values of BFD are obtained through
     negotiation through the out-of-band MPLS ping.


3.1.2 LSM

 


Govindan et al          Expires August 18, 2014                 [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT     Proactive fault detection in EVPN   February 14, 2014


     The packet contains the following labels: label identifying the P-
     Tunnel, upstream label which the PE has bound uniquely to the EVI 
     (for aggregate inclusive trees only). The G-ACh type is set to TBD.
     The yourDisc value is set to 0 and the myDisc value is uniquely
     generated by the root.

3.1.3 Unicast

     The packet contains the following labels: LSP label (transport)
     when not using PHP, the optional entropy label and the EVPN Unicast
     label. The G-ACh type is set to TBD. The discriminator values of
     BFD are obtained through negotiation through the out-of-band MPLS
     ping.

3.2 Using IP headers

     The encapsulation option using IP headers will not be suited for
     EVPN, as using different values in the destination IP address for
     data and OAM (BFD) packets could cause the BFD packets to follow a
     different path than that of data packets. Hence this option MUST
     NOT be used for EVPN.








4. Scalability Considerations

     The mechanisms proposed by this draft could affect the packet load
     on the network and its elements especially when supporting
     configurations involving a large number of EVIs. The option of
     slowing down or speeding up BFD timer values can be used by an
     administrator  or a network management entity to maintain the
     overhead incurred due to fault monitoring at an acceptable level.

5. Security Considerations

     This document does not introduce any new security issues, the
     security considerations defined in [BFD] and [P2MPBFD] apply in
     this document.

6  IANA Considerations

     A new G-Ach Type is requested for for GAL encapsulated BFD as the
     existing type [VCCV-BFD] specifically applies to PW-ACH
