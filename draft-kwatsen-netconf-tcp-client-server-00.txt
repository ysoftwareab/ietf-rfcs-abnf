             YANG Groupings for TCP Clients and TCP Servers
               draft-kwatsen-netconf-tcp-client-server-00

Abstract

   This document defines two YANG modules: the first defines a grouping
   for configuring a generic TCP client, and the second defines a
   grouping for configuring a generic TCP server.  It is intended that
   these groupings will be used by applications using the TCP protocol.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines two YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] modules: the first
   defines a grouping for configuring a generic TCP client, and the
   second defines a grouping for configuring a generic TCP server.  It
   is intended that these groupings will be used by applications using
   the TCP protocol.  For instance, these groupings could help define
   the configuration module for an SSH, TLS, or HTTP based application.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document are designed to be accessed
   via YANG based management protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TCP) with mutual
   authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the modules defined in this document only define groupings,
   these considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules
   that use these groupings.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG modules that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      NONE

   Some of the readable data nodes in the YANG modules may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      NONE

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      NONE

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document registers two URIs in the "ns" subregistry of the IETF
   XML Registry [RFC3688].  Following the format in [RFC3688], the
   following registrations are requested:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-client
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-server
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

6.2.  The YANG Module Names Registry

   This document registers two YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].  Following the format in [RFC6020], the following
   registrations are requested:

      name:         ietf-tcp-client
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-client
      prefix:       tcpc
      reference:    RFC XXXX

      name:         ietf-tcp-server
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-server
      prefix:       tcps
