Abstract

The goal of this Internet Draft, produced by the Internet School Networking
(ISN) group in the User Services Area of the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF), is to document the questions most commonly asked about
the Internet by those in the elementary and secondary school community,
and to provide pointers to sources which answer those questions.  It is
directed at educators, school media specialists, and school
administrators who are recently connected to the Internet, who are
accessing the Internet via dial-up or another means which is not a
direct connection, or who are considering an Internet connection as a
resource for their schools.

1.   Introduction

The elementary and secondary school community of teachers, media
specialists, administrators, and students is a growing population on
the Internet.  In general, this group of users approaches the Internet
with less experience in data network technology and fewer technical and
user support resources than other Internet user groups.  Many of their
questions are related to the special needs of the community, while
others are shared by any new user.  This draft
document attempts first to define the most frequently asked questions
related to the use of the Internet in undergraduate education and then
to provide not only answers but also pointers to further information.
For new user questions of a more general nature, the reader should get 
FYI 4, "FYI on Questions and Answers:  Answers to Commonly Asked 'New
Internet User' Questions." [1]  For information on how to get this
document, see Appendix B.

It is important to remember that the Internet is a volatile and
changing virtual environment.  We have tried to include only the most
stable of network services when listing resources and groups for you to
contact, a good solution but by no means a fool-proof one to the
problem of changing offerings on the Internet.  This constant change
also means that there is a lot out there that you will discover as you
begin to explore on your own.

Future updates of this memo will be produced as Internet School
Networking group members are made aware of new questions and of
insufficient or inaccuracte information in the memo.  The RFC number of
this document will change with each update, but the FYI number (XX)
will remain the same.

3.   Questions About the Internet in an Educational Setting

     3.1  What is the Internet?

       The Internet is a series of more than 10,000 interconnected
       computer networks around the world that makes it possible to
       share information almost instantly.  The networks are owned by
       countless commercial, research, governmental, and educational
       organizations and individuals.  The Internet allows the more
       than 1.5 million computers and 10 millions users of the system
       to collaborate easily and quickly through messaging, discussion
       groups, and conferencing.  Users are able to discover and access
       people and information, distribute information, and experiment
       with new technologies and services.  The Internet has become a
       major global infrastructure for education, research,
       professional learning, public service, and business and is
       currently growing at the rate of about ten percent per month.

       The Internet Society serves as the international organization
       for Internet cooperation and coordination.  See Section 9,
       "Resources and Contacts."

       For a more complete basic introduction to the Internet, see
       FYI 20, "What is the Internet?" [2]  Instructions on retrieving
       FYI documents can be found in Appendix B.

     3.2  What are the benefits of using the Internet in the
     classroom? 

	The Internet expands classroom resources dramatically by making
	many resources from all over the world available to students,
	teachers, and media specialists, including original source
	materials.  It brings information, data, images, and even
	computer software into the classroom from places otherwise
	impossible to reach, and it does this almost instantly.  Access
	to these resources can yield individual and group projects,
	collaboration, curriculum materials, and idea sharing not found
	in schools without Internet access.

	Internet access also makes possible contact with people all
	over the world, bringing into the classroom experts in every
	content area, new and old friends, and colleagues in
        education.  With an Internet connection, your site can	
	become a valuable source of information  as well.

	The isolation inherent in the teaching profession is well-known
	among educators.  By having access to colleagues in other parts
	of the world, as well as to those who work outside of
	classrooms, educators able to reach the Internet are not as
	isolated.

	A hands-on classroom tool, the use of networks can be a
	motivator for students in and of itself, and their use
	encourages the kind of independence and autonomy that many
	educators agree is important for students to achieve in their
	learning process.  Because the Internet is blind to class,
	race, ability, and disability, it is a natural for addressing
	the needs of all students; exactly how this is done will vary
	from school to school as the school empowers the individual.

     3.3  How can educators incorporate this resource into their busy
     schedules?

	Most educators learn about the Internet during the time they
	use to learn about any new teaching tool or resource.
	Realistically, of course, this means they "steal" time at
	lunch, on week-ends, and before and after school to explore
	resources and pursue relationships via the Internet.  Those who
	do so feel that it is well worth the rich rewards.  It's
	important that computers used to access the Internet are easily
	accessible and not so far away physically as to make using the
	resource impossible for educators and others.

	As the value of the resource becomes more evident, school
	systems will need to look toward building the time to use it
	into educators' schedules.

   3.4  I'm already using the National Geographic network (or Learning
   Link, or FrEdMail, or ______).  Does this have anything to do with the
   Internet?  Is the Internet different from what I'm already using?

	Since the Internet is a network of many different networks, you
	may be using one of the networks which is a part of the
	Internet.  Some commercial programs for schools use networks
	and provide value-added service, such as curriculum software,
	project organization and coordination, etc.  Some provide
	value-added service, but don't allow for all basic Internet
	services.  Networks like FrEdMail (Free Educational Electronic
	Mail) and K12Net are bulletin board systems linked via the
	Internet which provide inexpensive access to some Internet
	services.  If you can use telnet, FTP, and electronic mail, you
	are probably "on" the Internet.  If you have questions about
	the specific service you're currently using, ask its support
	personnel if you have Internet access, or call the InterNIC for
	help in figuring this out.  (InterNIC stands for Internet
	Network Information Center.)  See Section 9, "Resources and
	Contacts" for how to reach the InterNIC, FrEdMail, and K12Net.

4.   Questions About School Support for an Internet Connection

     4.1  Where does my school get the money for connecting to the
     Internet?

	Although school budgets are impossibly tight in most cases, the
	cost of an Internet connection can be squeezed from the budget
	when its value becomes apparent.  Costs for a low end connection
	can be quite reasonable.  (See the next question.)

	The challenge facing those advocating an Internet connection
	usually has less to do with the actual cost than it has with
	the difficulty of convincing administrators to spend money on
	an unfamiliar resource.

	In order to move the Internet connection closer to the top of
	your school's priority list, consider at least two
	possibilities.  First, your school may be in the process of
	reform, as are many schools.  Because use of the Internet
	shifts focus away from a teacher-as-expert model and toward one
	of shared responsibility for learning, it can be a vital part
	of school reform.  Much of school reform attempts to move away
	from teacher isolation and toward teacher collaboration, away
	from learning in a school-only context and toward learning in a
	life context, away from an emphasis on knowing and toward an
	emphasis on learning, away from a focus on content and toward a
	focus on concepts.  [3]  The Internet can play an integral part
	in helping to achieve these shifts.

	Second, to demonstrate the value of a connection, actual
	Internet access is more useful than words.  While this may
	sound like a chicken-and-egg situation (I have to have Internet
	access to get Internet access), some organizations will provide
	guest accounts on an Internet computer for people in schools
	who are trying to convince others of the value of an Internet
	connection.

        Contact local colleges, universities, technology companies,
        service providers, community networks, and government agencies for
        both guest accounts and funding ideas.  For alternatives to your
        own school's budget or for supplements to it, look for funding in
        federal, state, and district budgets as well as from private
        grants.  Work with equipment vendors to provide the hardware
        needed at low or no cost to your school, and consider forming a
        PTO Technology Committee, or a joint District/PTO Technology
        Committee.

        The Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) has
	information on grants and funding.  See Section 9, "Resources
	and Contacts."  Ask for the AskERIC InfoGuide called "Grants
	and Funding Sources."

   4.2  How much does it cost to connect to the Internet, and what kind
   of equipment (hardware, software, etc.) does my school need in order
   to support an Internet connection?

	The cost of an Internet connection varies tremendously with the
	location of your site and the kind of connection that is
	appropriate to your needs.  In order to determine the cost to
	your school, you will need to answer a number of questions.
	For help in learning what the questions are and getting answers
	to them, begin asking at local colleges, universities,
	technology companies, government agencies, community networks
	(often called "freenets"), local electronic bulletin board
	systems (BBS), or service providers.  (For a list of service
	providers, contact the InterNIC, which is listed in Section 9,
	"Resources and Contacts.")

	To give you an idea of possible equipment needs, here are
	three sample scenarios:

	Low-end:  You could subscribe to some kind of Internet dial-in
	service.  This may be provided by a vendor at a cost, by a
	local university gratis, or as a part of a public access
	service like a community network.  You'll need a computer which
	allows terminal emulation and a modem which is compatible with
	your dial-in service.  The approximate cost, not including the
	PC, is $100 - $800 plus a monthly fee of approximately $30.

	Mid-range:  You could subscribe to a dial-in service that
	provides Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) or Point to Point
	Protocol (PPP), allowing your machine to become a host on the
	Internet.  You'll need a computer with SLIP or PPP software and
	a modem which is compatible with your dial-in service.  The
	approximate cost, not including the PC, is $100 - $800 plus a
	monthly fee of approximately $60.

	High-end:  You could subscribe to a service that provides a
	full Internet connection.  You'll need a router and a CSU/DSU
	(Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit), a device which
	connects the router to the service provider's router.  A local
	area network, which may consist only of the router and a PC,
	Macintosh, or other computer system, is also needed, and your
	computer(s) will need some special software.  The approximate
	cost, not including the computers, is $2,000 - $3,000 plus a
	monthly fee of at least $200.

    4.3  What is required in terms of personnel to support an Internet
    connection?  (Will it require extra staff, training, more time of
    teachers and librarians?)

	Any plan for implementing technology in schools should consider
	staff development.  In the case of the Internet, all users will
	need some kind of training, whether they are teachers,
	librarians, students, administrators, or fulfilling other roles
	in the school.  Train-the-trainer is a good model for Internet
	training.

        Depending on the hardware involved, there may be a need for 
        technical support.  Finding this kind of support, which
	schools will certainly need because it is not usually in
	place, may be tricky.  Some districts are beginning to
	provide it at the district level.  Some schools are able
	to use volunteers from business, industry, or government 
	agencies.  Much of this type of support can be done over
	the network itself, which makes it possible for someone
	located off-site to maintain the equipment with only
	occasional trips to the school.

    4.4  How do I convince the people in our system with the purse
    strings to spend money on this?

	Most people become convinced with exposure.  One excited
	individual in the school who is able to show proof of concept
	by starting a pilot program can be the catalyst for a school or
	an entire district.  If you can get an Internet account (as
	suggested above) and use it for instruction in your classroom,
	you can make presentations at faculty, PTO, and school board
	meetings.

	The National Center for Education Statistics in the Office of
	Educational Research and Improvement at the United States
	Department of Education has released a video targeted at school
	administrators.  Its purpose is to educate them about what the
	Internet is and to encourage support for the use of
	telecommunications in elementary and secondary schools.  For
	further information, See Section 9, "Resources and Contacts."
	[Note:  this is due out some time this summer...has not been
	released yet, but will be by the time this document is ready.]

    4.5  Where do I go for technical support and training?

	Much technical support and training can be found by using the
	Internet itself.  You can post questions to people in the know
	and join discussion lists and news groups that discuss and
	answer questions about support and training.  Specific
	electronic mail lists to look for are....
	Specific news groups to look for are...

	Your local community has resources that you may be able to
	tap.  These are again colleges and universities, businesses,
	computer clubs and user groups, and government agencies.

        Your service provider may offer training and support for
	technical issues, and other groups also offer formal classes
	and seminars.  For those schools who have designated 
	technical people, they are good candidates for classes and
	seminars. 

5.  Questions About Implementation and Technical Issues

    5.1  How do I learn about options for getting my school connected?

	In addition to suggestions made in answer to questions 4.1 and
	4.2 above, you may contact the InterNIC at 1-800-444-4345 for a
	referral to a service provider.  Also, there are a number of
	books on the Internet.  See Section 8, "Suggested Reading."

    5.2  How many of our computers should we put on the Internet?

	You will probably want to make Internet *access* possible for
	as many of your school's computers as possible.  If you are
	using a dial-up service, you may want one account per
	classroom.  If your school has a Local Area Network (LAN) with
	several computers on it, one dedicated Internet connection will
	service the whole school.

     5.3  Should we set up a telecommunications lab or put networked
     computers in each classroom?
        
	Consider doing both, and get a commitment from specific teachers
	or media specialists to use the labs in the course of their
	teaching.

     5.4  Can people get on the Internet from home?
        
	This depends on your service provider.  It is certainly a
	possibility.  You will need to discuss whether you want to
	make this option available to students even if it is possible
	technically.  This is best discussed with the community your
	school serves in a public forum such as a PTO meeting.

6.   Questions About Security and Ethics

     6.1  Who should have access in the school, the teachers or the
     students?

	Clearly the answer is that teachers AND students should have
	access to the Internet.  There's no reason why media
	specialists, administrators and support staff should not also
	have access.  In elementary schools, access for students may be
	more supervised than in the upper grades.

     6.2  I've heard that there are files on the Internet that parents
     would not like their children to get.  How can students be kept
     from accessing this objectionable material?

	Technically, they can't.  Everyone on the network, including
	students, is able to download files from public electronic
	repositories, some of which contain materials that many
	consider objectionable.  For this reason, it is important that
	schools develop clear policies to guide students' use of the
	Internet and establish rules, and consequences for breaking
	them, that govern behavior on the Internet.  Additionally,
	schools should consider integrating issues around technology
	and ethics into the curriculum.  [4]

     6.3  How do we keep our own and other people's computers safe from
     student "hackers"?

	In the language of computer folks, a "hacker" is someone who is
	excellent at understanding and manipulating computer systems.
	A "cracker" is someone who maliciously and/or illegally enters
	or attempts to enter someone else's computer system.

	Computer security is unquestionably important, both in
	maintaining the security of the school's computers and in
	ensuring the proper behavior of the school's students (and
	other who use the network).  In this area, not only school
	policy, but also state and national laws may apply.  Two
	sources of information which you can read to help you sort
	through securty issues are:

		FYI 8:  Site Security Handbook 
		"Ethical Uses of Information Technologies in 
		     Education" 

        The full references for these documents can be found in Section
	8, "Suggested Reading."

     6.4  How do we keep viruses from attacking all our computers if we
     get connected to the Internet?

	 You will need to run regular checks for viruses on all of your
	 systems.  Virus checking software is available free over the
	 Internet via Anonymous FTP from ftp.cert.org.  (For
	 information on using Anonymous FTP, see Appendix B.)  Your
	 hardware or software vendor, your network access provider,
	 your technical support resources, or your colleagues on
	 network mailing lists should be able to provide more specific
	 information applicable to your site.

     6.5  What are the rules for using the Internet?

	  When your Internet connection is established, your access
	  provider should acquaint you with their Acceptable Use Policy
	  (AUP).  This policy explains the acceptable and
	  non-acceptable uses for your connection.  For example, it is
	  in all cases unacceptable to use the network for illegal
	  purposes.  It may, in some cases, be unacceptable to use the
	  netowrk for commercial purposes.  If such a policy is not
	  mentioned, ask for it.  All users are expected to know what
	  the acceptable and unacceptable uses of their network are.
	  Remember that it is essential to establish a school-wide
	  policy in addition to the provider's AUP.

7.   Questions About Educational Collaboration, Projects, and Resources

     7.1  What kinds of educational projects using the Internet are
     effective?

	  Generally projects which use the Internet as a tool and focus
	  on content other than telecommunications itself are those
	  that engage students.

          [Need more...looking for input from educators in the field.]

     7.2  How can I find specific projects using the Internet that are
     already developed?

	  There are a few resources on the Internet that are directed
	  specifically at the elemenatary and secondary school
	  communities.  The InterNIC gopher server has a section on
	  K-12 (Kindergarten through 12th grade) Education, the
	  Consortium for School Networking maintains a gopher server,
	  and NASA's Spacelink is directed entirely at elementary and
	  secondary school educators and students.  For access to any
	  of these, see Section 9, "Resources and Contacts."

	  Many people on electronic mailing lists such as Ednet,
	  Kidsphere, and the Consortium for School Networking
	  Discussion List (cosndisc) post their projects and ask for
	  partners and collaborators.  The K12 hierarchy of Usenet News
	  has several groups where educators post these invitations as
	  well.  For subscription to the electronic lists and access to
	  the news groups, see Section 9, "Resources and Contacts."

	  As you explore the Internet, there are some tools that will
	  help you find projects that are already developed.  To begin
	  your exploration, two tools for information discovery and 
	  retrieval that you should learn to use are WAIS (Wide Area 
	  Information Server) and Gopher.   Later you may want to learn
	  about and try Archie and WWW (World Wide Web).

	  A good overview of many of these resource discovery tools is
	  the "Guide to Network Resource Tools" written by the European
	  Academic Research Networks (EARN) Association.  It explains
	  the basics of tools such as Gopher, Veronica, WAIS, Archie,
	  and the World Wide Web, as well as others, and provides
	  pointers for finding out more about these useful tools.

     7.3  Where do I go to find colleagues who support networking and
     schools willing to participate in projects?

	   The electronic mailing lists and Usenet News groups in
	   Section 9, "Resources and Contacts" are rich with people who
	   want to collaborate on projects involving use of the
	   Internet.
           
	   There are a number of conferences you may want to look in
	   to.  The National Education Computing Conference (NECC) is
	   held annually, as is TelEd, a conference sponsored by the
           Interntational Society for Technology in Education.   The
	   INET conference is the annual conference for the Internet
	   Society.  [Note: Any conferences located in parts of the
	   world other than the US?]  For contact information, see
	   Section 9, "Resources and Contacts."

     7.4  What are some examples of how the Internet is being used in
     classrooms now?

	   Projects which use the Internet sometimes require sites from
	   all over the world to contribute data from the local area
	   then compile that data for use by all.  Weather patterns,
	   pollutants in water or air,  and Monarch butterfly migration
	   are some of the data that has been collected over the
	   Internet.  In Appendix A you will find several examples from
	   the Kidsphere electronic mailing list, each from a different
	   content area and representing different ways of using the
	   Internet.

     7.5  Is there a manual that lists sites on the Internet
     particularly useful for class exploration?

	There are a number of resource guides, and so far only a couple
	are directed specifically at an education audience.  "An
	Incomplete Guide to the Internet and Other Telecommunications
	Opportunities Especially for Teachers and Students K-12" is
	compiled by the NCSA Education Group.  Ednet's "Educator's
	Guide to Email Lists" is available electronically, as is a list
	of Usenet News groups under education headings.  ERIC offers
	several documents relating to telecommunications and education,
	including the ERIC Digest "Internet Basics," the ERIC Review
	"K-12 Networking," "Instructional Development for Distance
	Education," and "Strategies for Teaching at a Distance."

	Complete bilbliographic information for these documents is
	listed in Section 8, "Suggested Reading."  For help in
	retrieving the documents electronically, see Appendix B.

     7.6  How can I add my own contributions to the Internet?  

	 The network server operated by the Consortium for School
	 Networking exists expressly for the sharing of ideas by the
	 elementary and secondary school community.  Educators are
	 encouraged to submit projects, lesson plans, and ideas.  See
	 Section 9, "Resources and Contacts" for information on
	 reaching CoSN or submitting materials.  It is important to
	 remember that anything you create should be updated for others
	 as you make changes yourself in the course of your learning by
	 experience.

         The electronic lists and news groups mentioned are also places
	 to share your knowledge and yourself as a resource.

PROJECT GOALS :  -to increase student motivation for math
                 problem solving;

                 -to emphasize the importance of addressing
                  problems in a clear, concise, and logical
                  manner;

                 -to provide students with opportunities for
                  developing skills in written expression;

                 -to familiarize students with computer and
                  modem as tools for problem solving projects.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
                 The puzzles presented in this project are no
                 mere entertainment.  These puzzles will help
                 the student reason logically, develop thinking
                 skills, and will assist in the understanding of
                 many practical disciplines, such as geometry.
                 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT to remember that getting
                 the correct answer isn't as important as
                 figuring out how to find it.
                 DO THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO BE SUBMITTED IN A 
                 PARTICULAR FASHION?  Yes, the solution format
                 requires that the group/team/individual first 
                 1)restate the puzzle/problem;   2)explain the
                 strategy, or strategies used in finding the
                 answer;  3)state the answer.
                 Your team/class may turn in only one solution.
                 That means you must work together to develop one
                 solution to be examined by the "Puzzlemeister".
                 SEND THE SOLUTION TO THE FOLLOWING ONLINE

*****************************************************************
 
The first annual Internet Poetry Contest invites entries from
students in grades 9-12 for original sonnets written within the
last 3 years.  The purpose of the contest is to encourage  young
creative writers to practice the discipline needed to
write in a particular poetic form, in this case, the sonnet form. 
(The sonnet is defined and examples are given below.)  Sonnets
may be submitted in any recognized sonnet form including
Petrarchan, Shakespearean, Miltonic, or Spenserian.
 
Students submitting entries must include a form (given below)
certifying that each sonnet entered in the contest is original
and written within the last 3 years.  The deadline for
mailing entries is April 30, 1993.  Winners will be notified
individually and winning entries will also be announced via
Academy I on the Internet.
 
Judges for the contest are current or retired English instructors
throughout the United States.
 
The Sonnet
 
The sonnet as defined by Babette Deutsch in Poetry Handbook is as
follows:
 
     Normally a poem of fourteen iambic pentameter lines, divided
into an octave* and a sestet**, with a prescribed rhyme scheme,
and concerned with a single thought or sentiment.   Originating
in Provence, the particular form called the Italian sonnet was
perfected by Petrarch and therefore is also known as Petrarchan. 
 
Its OCTAVE is rhymed a b b a a b b a, the SESTET is on two or
three rhymes, distinct from those in the octave, and while
various arrangements are accepted, those commonly used are 
c d c - d c d, c d e c d e, c d e d c e.  The octave presents 
the theme in the first quatrain*** and develops it in the second;
the sestet exemplifies or reflects upon it in the first TERCET
and brings it to a logical emphatic close in the second. The 
Italian form has been used by poets writing in English, but
rarely with the complete fidelity of the following example by
Dante Gabriel Rossetti:
 
     The gloom that breathes upon me with these airs
          Is like the drops which strike the traveller's brow
          Who knows not, darkling, if they bring him now
     Fresh storm, or be old rain the covert bears.
     Ah! bodes this hour some harvest of new tares,
        Or hath but memory of the day whose plough
        Sowed hunger once,--the night at length when thou,
     O prayer found vain, didst fall from out my prayers?

     How prickly were the growths which yet how smooth,
        Along the hedgerows of this journey shed,
    Lie by Time's grace till night and sleep may soothe!
        Even as the thistledown from pathsides dead
    Gleaned by a girl in autumns of her youth,
        Which one new year makes soft her marriage-bed.

*   eight lines
**  six lines
*** four lines

___________________________________________________________________________

     The English or Shakespearean sonnet allows for a break between octave
and sestet but is composed of three quatrains, each with different pairs of
rhymes, and a final couplet, independently rhymed, which
makes an effective climax: a b a b, 
c d c d, e f e f, g g as in
Shakespeare's seventy-third sonnet:

That time of yeare thou maist in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few doe hange
Upon those boughes which shake against the could,
Bare ruin'd quiers, where late the sweet birds sang.
In me thou seest the twi-light of such day,
As after Sun-set fadeth in the West,
Which by and by blacke night doth take away,
Deaths second selfe that seals up all in rest.
In me thous seest the glowing of such fire,
That on the ashes of his youth doth lye,
As the death bed, whereon it must expire,
Consum'd with that which it was nurrisht by.
This thou percev'st, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.

Example Three,  "Tracking Monarch Butterflies"
==============================================

Our school has begun a study of monarchs using Nova's Animal Pathfinders. 
After working through these lessons, which will give us the necessary
background information, we will design the format for collecting the data
on sighting monarchs. We will send information on the format to any school
who wishes to participate in the project.  Our fifth grade students will
begin this project and we hope that students from kindergarten through
twelvth grade will get involved.  We hope that schools from south to north
along the migratory flyways will be interested in joining and collecting
data about first sightings and population counts. We still have not foundt
the lepidopterists who did the initial research but will keep looking.
Hope to heaar from you soon.  Susan Agate       agate@bush.edu

SPECIAL EVENT: NESPUT 24-HOUR CENTENNIAL SPACE SHUTTLE
                SIMULATED MISSION ON APRIL 27, 1993
 
SCHOOLS, TEACHERS, STUDENTS, SPACE ENTHUSIASTS:
 
The April 27 simulated and telecommunicated space shuttle mission
is a mostly real-time 24 hour mission involving numerous
activities in space.  Your school could be involved for an entire
24 hour period or for a much lesser amount of time (say just your
school day or even a few hours).  During that 24 hour period,
schools will be linked to share information via telecommunications
and a variety of activities will be going on via
telecommunications and in the classroom--most of them created by
the schools and students involved.  The space shuttle Centennial
at University School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, a real and permanent
simulator, will act as itself and use its mission control area as
Houston.  Reports on the progress of our real student astronauts
will be posted on the listserv and via the menus on NPTN affiliate
systems carrying Academy One.  Your school can act as any one of
the
following:
 
A second American shuttle.
A second Russian shuttle.
A weather reporting station for your area.
One of NASA's alternate landing sites.
A science station posing questions and problems for all
  astronauts in simulated space.
An information station, posting interesting information of
  interest about the space shuttle and the space program.
A graphics station, sending GIF files to other schools
  (especially good if you have a scanner for your computer).
Any other type of space related station or activity you can

WHAT IS A LISTSERVE?
 
A listserve is an internet system which allows a message sent to
it to be distributed to all subscribers to the listserve.  Hence,
if 200 people are subscribed to the listserve, one message which
you send to the listserve (at one electronic mail address) is
automatically sent to all 200 subscribers.  The result is a
mechanism for the exchange of views and data which is very
efficient. You don't need telnet access, just internet or bitnet
e.mail capability.  The National Public Telecomputing Network's
Academy One NESPUT (National Educational Simulations Project Using
Telecommunications) education project will use this "mail
exploder" technique as part of the April 27th simulated space
shuttle mission.
 
HOW DO YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THE APRIL 27 SPACE SHUTTLE SIMULATED
MISSION LISTSERVE?
 
Simply send an electronic mail message to:
 
mission-request@sbase2.wariat.org
 
When you are prompted for a subject, simply type the word
"subscribe" (without the quotes).  Do not actually send any
message.  Within several hours you will receive an acknowledgement
of your subscription.
 
SPECIAL INFORMATION FILE
 
A file explaining the mission and its purposes including
information on how you can join is available by sending an e.mail
message to
 
mission-request@sbase2.wariat.org
 
When you are prompted for a subject, simply type FILE.  Do not
actually send a message.
 
WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS OR NEED HELP
 
If you have questions about the listserve, send an e.mail message

Example Five, "Equinox Experiment and Calculation"
==================================================


            ATTENTION - MARCH 20, l993 IS THE EQUINOX
                                
             A WORLDWIDE SCIENCE AND MATH EXPERIMENT

                     ERATOSTHENES EXPERIMENT

Eratosthenes, a Greek geographer (about 276 to 194 B.C.), made  a 
surprisingly accurate estimate of the earth's circumference.   In 
the great library in Alexandria he read that a deep vertical well 
near Syene, in southern Egypt, was entirely lit up by the sun  at 
noon  once a year.  Eratosthenes reasoned that at this  time  sun 
must  be directly overhead, with its rays shining  directly  into 
the well.  In Alexandria, almost due north of Syene, he knew that 
the sun was not directly overhead at noon on the same day because 
a vertical object cast a shadow.  Eratosthenes could now  measure 
the  circumference  of the earth (sorry Columbus) by  making  two 
assumptions - that the earth is round and that the sun's rays are 
essentially  parallel.  He set up a vertical post  at  Alexandria 
and  measured the angle of its shadow when the well at Syene  was 
completely sunlit.  Eratosthenes knew from geometry that the size 
of  the  measured  angle equaled the size of  the  angle  at  the 
earth's  center between Syene and Alexandria.  Knowing also  that 
the arc of an angle this size was 1/50 of a circle, and that  the 
distance between Syene and Alexandria was 5000 stadia, he  multi-
plied 5000 by 50 to find the earth's circumference.  His result,
250,000  stadia (about 46,250 km) is quite close to modern  meas-
urements.   Investigating the Earth, AGI, l970, Chapter 3, p. 66.

The formula Eratosthenes used is:
                      
     D         A        d=distance between Syene and Alexandria             
   _____  =  _____      A=360 degrees assumption of round earth 
                        a=shadow angle of vertical stick 
     d         a        D=to be determined (circumference)

----------------------------------------------------------------

Are you interested in participating?

All you need to do is place a vertical stick (shaft) into the 
ground at your school and when the sun reaches it's highest 
vertical  assent for the day (solar noon), measure the  angle  of 
the shadow of the stick.
                            -\
                            - \
                  stick ->  -  \
                            - a \    a=shadow angle
                            -    \ 
                            -     \     
   ground___________________-______\_____________________________
By doing this experiment on the equinox we all know that the 
vertical rays of the sun are directly over the equator, like the
well  at Syene.  Using a globe or an atlas the  distance  between 
your  location and the equator can be determined and the  circum-
ference can be calculated.
*****************************************************************
But how about sharing your shadow angle measurement with others
around the real globe.
******************************************************************

Send your measurement of the shadow angle____________degrees

Send your location city ____________________________________

Send your location country _________________________________

Send your latitude _________________________________________

Send your longitude ________________________________________

To:  Lakewood High School  bd765@cleveland.freenet.edu

We  will compile all the data and send you a copy to use in  your 
classroom  to compare the various locations and angles.

If you're interested send us your data.  We will compile and return
it  to you by March 25, l993.  Chances are your lesson plans will 
not be able to fit this in on Saturday March 20 , 1993 (the equi-
nox).  Most any day plus or minus 2 days of the equinox will give 
fairly good data (like Thurday, Friday, Monday or Tuesday).

Example Six, "Famous Black Americans"
=====================================

Project Name:        Who Am I?:  Famous Black Americans  

Subject Area:        Social Studies, Research Skills

Grade Level:         Grades 4-12

Project Description: The goal of this project is to assist students
                     in increasing their knowledge of American
                     black history.  Each week, on Monday Morning,
                     a set of three or four clues will be sent to
                     your account.  The same will occur on
                     Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday mornings. 
                     At any time, through the end of the day on
                     Friday, your students may send their answer
                     (the name of the famous American identified
                     by the clues) to the following online
                     address:

                           whoami@radford.vak12ed.edu

                     A class should send only one answer each
                     week.  If two are sent, the sponsors will
                     assume that the first of the answers is the
                     one intended to be submitted.

                     The sponsor will collect all answers, compile
                     a listing of classes who send the correct
                     answers, and will forward this list to all
                     participants via email by early on the
                     following Monday morning.  On that morning,
                     in addition, the sponsor will send all
                     classes a new problem.

                     This project lasts five weeks, with clues
                     each week being given for a different famous
                     person in American history.
