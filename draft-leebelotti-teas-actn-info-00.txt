   interfaces identified in the ACTN architecture and framework
   document [ACTN-Frame].

   The ACTN reference architecture identified a three-tier control
   hierarchy as depicted in Figure 1:

   - Customer Network Controllers (CNC)
   - Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC)
   - Physical Network Controllers (PNC).

   The two interfaces with respect to the MDSC, one north of the MDSC
   and the other south of the MDSC are referred to as CMI (CNC-MDSC
   Interface) and MPI (MDSC-PNC Interface), respectively. It is
   intended to model these two interfaces with one common model.

   destination applications refer to applications in which the
   selection of the destination of a network path for a given source
   needs to be decided dynamically to support such applications.

   Data Center selection problems arise for VM mobility, disaster
   recovery and load balancing cases. VN's service policy plays an
   important role for virtual network operation. Service policy can be
   static or dynamic. Dynamic service policy for data center selection
   may be placed as a result of utilization of data center resources
   supporting VNs. The MSDC would then incorporate this information to
   meet the service objective of this application.

   This scenario is similar to the previous case in that the VN service
   policy for the application can be met by a set of multiple
   destinations that provide the required virtual network functions
   (VNF). Virtual network functions can be, for example, security
   functions required by the VN application. The VN service policy by
   the CNC would indicate the locations of a certain VNF that can be
   fulfilled. This policy information is critical in finding the
   optimal network path subject to this constraint. As VNFs can be
   dynamically moved across different DCs, this policy should be
   dynamically enforced from the CNC to the MDSC and the PNCs.

   Network Function Virtualization Services are usually setup between
   customers' premises and service provider premises and are provided
   mostly by cloud providers or content delivery providers. The context
   may include, but not limited to a security function like firewall, a
   traffic optimizer, the provisioning of storage or computation
   capacity where the customer does not care whether the service is
   implemented in a given data center or another.

   These services may be hosted virtually by the provider or physically
   part of the network. This allows the service provider to hide his
   own resources (both network and data centers) and divert customer
   requests where most suitable. This is also known as "end points
   mobility" case and introduces new concepts of traffic and service
   provisioning and resiliency (e.g., Virtual Machine mobility).

      Figure 6: E2E VN Survivability and Multi-layer Coordination for
                        Protection and Restoration

   Figure 6 shows the need for E2E protection/restoration control
   coordination that involves CNC, MDSC and PNCs to meet the VN
   survivability requirement. VN survivability requirement and its
   policy need to be translated into multi-domain and multi-layer
   network protection and restoration scenarios across different
   controller types. After an E2E path is setup successfully, the MSDC
   has a unique role to enforce policy-based flexible VN survivability
   requirement by coordinating all PNC domains.

   As seen in Figure 6, multi-layer (i.e., packet/optical) coordination
   is a subset of this E2E protection/restoration control operation.
   The MDSC has a role to play in determining an optimal
   protection/restoration level based on the customer's VN
   survivability requirement. For instance, the MDSC needs to interface
   the PNC for packet core as well as the PNC for optical core and
   enforce protection/restoration policy as part of the E2E
   protection/restoration. Neither the PNC for packet core nor the PNC
   for optical core is in a position to be aware of the E2E path and
   its protection/restoration situation. This role of the MSDC is
   unique for this reason. In some cases, the MDSC will have to
   determine and enforce optical bypass to find a feasible reroute path
   upon packet core network failure which cannot be resolved the packet
   core network itself.

   To coordinate this operation, the PNCs will need to update its
   domain level abstract topology upon resource changes due to a
   network failure or other factors. The MSDC will incorporate all
   these update to determine if an alternate E2E reroute path is
   necessary or not based on the changes reported from the PNCs. It
   will need to update the E2E abstract topology and the affected CN's
   VN topology in real-time. This refers to dynamic synchronization of
   topology from Physical topology to abstract topology to VN topology.

   MDSC will also need to perform the path restoration signaling to the
   affected PNCs whenever necessary.



3. ACTN common interfaces information model

   This section provides ACTN common interface information model to
   support primitives between controllers: CNC-MDSC and MDSC-PNC.

   The basic primitives are required between the controllers. It is
   described between a client controller and a server controller. A
   client-server relationship is recursive between a CNC and a MDSC and
   between a MDSC and a PNC. In the CMI interface, the client is a CNC

   while the server is a MDSC. In the MPI interface, the client is a
   MDSC and the server is a PNC. At a minimum, the following primitives
   should be supported:

   - Virtual Network (VN) Instantiate/Modify/Delete
   - VN Topology Update (Push Model)

   <VN> ::= <VN Identifier>

            <VN Action>

            <End-Point List>

            <VN Topology Metric>

            <Traffic-Matrix>

            <VN Survivability>

            <VN Status>

            <VN Topology>



   Where

   <VN Identifier> is an identifier that identifies a particular VN.

   <VN Action> is an indicator if this <VN> is for (i) instantiate,
   (ii) modify; (iii) delete. There may be a case where a query of a VN
   is necessary before an instantiate request. This is subject to
   further investigation.

   <End-Point List> ::= (<Interface Identifier>

                        [<Client Capability>])...

         It is assumed that a list of interface identifiers has been
         known to the server prior to the VN Query message flow.


         <Client Capability> ::= <Client Interface Capability>

                                    [<Client-specific Policy>]

                        The Client Capability comprises the client interface
         capability (e.g., maximum interface bandwidth, etc.) and other
         client-specific policy information.



         <Client-specific Policy> ::= <End-Client Policy> |

                                   <Network-Client Policy>

         Where

         <End-Client Policy> pertains to end-client policies which
         specify the end-client related service/operational policies.
         Details of this field will be supplied in a later revision.

         <Network-Client Policy> pertains to the policies related to
         multi-domain network operation assumed by the MDSC. For
         example, domain selection preference in the context of multi-
         domain networks is a network-client policy. Details of this
         field will be supplied in a later revision.



      <Location Service Profile> describes the End-Point Location's
      support for certain Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) (e.g.,
      security function, firewall capability, etc.).


      <End-Point Dynamic Selection Policy> describes if the End-Point
      can support load balancing, disaster recovery or VM migration.



   <VN Topology Metric> ::= <VN Topology Type>

                               <VN Topology Cost>

         Where

         <VN Topology Type> ::= <Path Vector> | <Graph>

         <VN Topology Cost> describes a particular cost associated with
         the VN Topology link/path such as reservable bandwidth,
         maximum link/path capacity, latency, etc.

         <VN Topology Preference> describes if the request is

           .  a single vs. a bulk request,
           .  VN diversity preference (in case of a bulk request,
               whether VNs should be disjoint or not),
           .  SRLG is required in describing link/path topology, or
           .  Others TDB.


         <VN Topology Objective Function> indicates a specific
         objective function for computing a path vector. This only
         applies when the VN Topology Type is a path vector.

                                    <Incremental Update>

      Where

          <Local Reroute Allowed> is a delegation policy to the Server
          to allow or not a local reroute fix upon a failure of the
          primary LSP.

          <Domain Preference> is only applied on the MPI where the MDSC
          (client) provides a domain preference to each PNC (server).

          <Push Allowed> is a policy that allows a server to trigger an
          updated VN topology upon failure without an explicit request
          from the client.

          <Increment Update> is another policy that triggers an
          increment update from the server.

   <VN Status> is the status indicator whether the VN has been
   successfully instantiated/modified/deleted in the server network or
   not in response to <VN Action>.

   <VN Topology> describes the resulting VN topology. Details of <VN
   Topology> are TDB.

   <VN Connectivity Topology> describes the instantiated VN property.
   Details are TBD.
