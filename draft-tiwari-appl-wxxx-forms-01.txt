Abstract

   This document proposes to standardize application/w-xxx-forms, a
media type for use in sending requests involving form-input from a
browser to a http server.  These requests are currently sent via the
HyperText Transfer Protocol on the World Wide Web.

1  Introduction

   In order for efficient and accurate communication between a
browser and a host, there must be a standard format used to exchange 
data.  Currently, all related major applications conforming to HTTP 
standards (browsers and web servers) do use the same format.  However,
this format has not been made a formal standard.

   The media type, application/w-xxx-forms, is a standalone data
transport format and is widely used by all major applications.  As 
application/w-xxx-forms is an integral part of sending data over the 
internet and since such media types belong in the IETF tree, this 
media type should also belong in the IETF tree.

2  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

3  application/w-xxx-forms Media Type

   This document standardizes application/w-xxx-forms as the standalone
data transport format for communication between a browser and a host.
When used for HTTP 1.1 GET requests, it shall be identical to the query
as described in [RFC 2068].  All the requests use only the ISO 8859_1
character set and are treated as plain text by the server.  However,
certain characters have to be encoded in a different manner for the
host to interpret the request correctly.

Registration information for this media type is described below.  The
hex value of each character listed is given in parenthesis following
the character.

   Registration Information

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: w-xxx-forms

   Mandatory parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations:

      This media type uses only the ISO 8859_1 character set.

      Certain characters have special meaning.  They are the ampersand
  ('&'), percent ('%'), and space (' ') characters.

      '&' (x'26')

         The ampersand is used as the delimiter between the name/value pairs in
the query string.

      '%' (x'25')

         The percent is used to transmit hexadecimal values as part 
of the request.

      ' ' (x'20')

	 The space is considered by some browsers as the end of the
	 request.  Therefore, if a space is incorporated in a request,
	 it will be encoded appropriately.

      Certain characters need to be encoded prior to being transmitted to the server.

      '&' (x'26'); '%' (x'25'); '+' (x'2B')

         As these characters have special meaning, they shall be encoded before
being transmitted.  This will be done by preceding the ISO 8859_1
hexadecimal value of these characters with a '%' sign.

      Space (x'20')

         Some browsers/servers see a space as the end of the request or have
trailing spaces suppressed.  Depending on the browser/server, this can
pose a potential problem when a query string containing spaces is sent
along with the Universal Resource Locator (URL).  To circumvent this
situation, all spaces shall be encoded as '+' (x'2B') signs.

   Security Considerations: none

   Interoperability considerations: none

   Published specification: none

   Applications which use this media type:

      This media type shall be accepted by all major HTTP browsers and servers.

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      A basic request for a url conforms to HTTP standards and the format is

         http://url

      With interactive websites, the user-input is submitted in the form of
 a query string.  The query string is preceded by a '?' and attached to
 the end of a url.  The query string is sent as a list of name/value
 pairs.  An '=' (x'3D') shall separate each name from its corresponding
 value.  Each pair shall be separated by an '&' (ampersand).  The
 format of a request consisting of a query string will be

         http://url?name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3

4  Examples

   The examples below give the value of the Content-type MIME header 
and the Application/w-xxx-forms declaration.  Note that other MIME 
headers may be present, and the entity may contain other data in 
addition to the media type declaration.

4.1 '&' to separate user input fields

   field1="value1", field2="value2"

   http://www.your-domain-here.com?field1=value1&field2=value2

4.2 '%' to send special characters

   field1="value1+value2"

   http://www.your-domain-here.com?field1=value1%2Bvalue2

   field1="value1&value2"

   http://www.your-domain-here.com?field1=value1%26value2

   field1="value1%value2"

   http://www.your-domain-here.com?field1=value1%25value2

4.3 ' '

   field1="value1 value2"

   http://www.your-domain-here.com?field1=value1+value2
