            A Format for Self-published IP Geolocation Feeds
                draft-google-self-published-geofeeds-05

Abstract

   This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish
   a mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation
   information, colloquially termed a geolocation "feed".  Interested
   parties can poll and parse these feeds to update or merge with other
   geolocation data sources and procedures.  This format intentionally
   only allows specifying coarse level location.

   Some technical organizations operating networks that move from one
   conference location to the next have already experimentally published
   small geolocation feeds.

   This document describes a currently deployed format.  At least one
   consumer (Google) has incorporated these feeds into a geolocation
   data pipeline, and a significant number of ISPs are using it to
   inform them where their prefixes should be geolocated.

   [RFC Ed - Please remove publication: The IETF Meeting network
   currently publishes a feed in this format at:
   https://noc.ietf.org/geo/google.csv -- this has significantly cut
   down on the number of "Gah!  Why does the network believe I'm in
   Montreal, that was last meeting!  How am I supposed to find a pub?!"
   complaints.  A number of other meeting networks, including RIPE and
   ICANN publish this information as well, see below. ]

   information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings,
   etc.  They will be removed before publication.]

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   Providers of services over the Internet have grown to depend on best-
   effort geolocation information to improve the user experience.
   Locality information can aid in directing traffic to the nearest
   serving location, inferring likely native language, and providing
   additional context for services involving search queries.

   When an ISP, for example, changes the location where an IP prefix is
   deployed, services which make use of geolocation information may
   begin to suffer degraded performance.  This can lead to customer
   complaints, possibly to the ISP directly.  Dissemination of correct
   geolocation data is complicated by the lack of any centralized means
   to coordinate and communicate geolocation information to all
   interested consumers of the data.

   This document records a format whereby a network operator (an ISP, an
   enterprise, or any organization which deems the geolocation of its IP
   prefixes to be of concern) can publish a mapping of IP address
   prefixes to simplified geolocation information, colloquially termed a
   "geolocation feed".  Interested parties can poll and parse these
   feeds to update or merge with other geolocation data sources and
   procedures.

   This document describes a currently deployed format.  At least one
   consumer (Google) has incorporated these feeds into a geolocation
   data pipeline, and a significant number of ISPs are using it to
   inform them where their prefixes should be geolocated.

1.2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

1.3.  Implications of publication

   This document describes both a format and a mechanism for publishing
   data, with the implication that the owner of the data wishes it to be
   public.  Any privacy risk is bounded by the format, and feed
   publishers MAY omit any location field to further protect privacy
   (see Section 2.1 for details about which fields exactly may be
   omitted).  Feed publishers assume the responsibility of determining
   which data should be made public.

   This proposal does not incorporate a mechanism to communicate
   acceptable use policies for self-published data.  Publication itself
   is inferred as a desire by the publisher for the data to be usefully
   consumed, similar to the publication of information like host names,
   cryptographic keys, and SPF records [RFC4408] in the DNS.

2.  Self-published IP geolocation feeds

   The format described here was developed to address the need of
   network operators to rapidly and usefully share geolocation
   information changes.  Originally, there arose a specific case where
   regional operators found it desirable to publish location changes
   rather than wait for geolocation algorithms to "learn" about them.
   Later, technical conferences which frequently use the same network
   prefixes advertised from different conference locations experimented
   by publishing geolocation feeds, updated in advance of network
   location changes, in order to better serve conference attendees.

   At its simplest, the mechanism consists of a network operator
   publishing a file (the "geolocation feed"), which contains several
   text entries, one per line.  Each entry is keyed by a unique (within
   the feed) IP prefix (or single IP address) followed by a sequence of
   network locality attributes to be ascribed to the given prefix.

2.1.  Specification

   For operational simplicity, every feed should contain data about all
   IP addresses the provider wants to publish.  Alternatives, like
   publishing only entries for IP addresses whose geolocation data has
   changed or differ from current observed geolocation behavior "at
   large", are likely to be too operationally complex.

   Feeds MUST use UTF-8 [RFC3629] character encoding.  Text after a '#'
   character is treated as a comment only and ignored.  Blank lines are
   similarly ignored.

   Feeds lines that are not comments MUST be in comma separated value
   (CSV) format as described in [RFC4180].  Each feed entry is a text
   line of the form:

       ip_prefix,country,region,city,postal_code

   The IP prefix field is REQUIRED, all others are OPTIONAL (can be
   empty), though the requisite minimum number of commas SHOULD be
   present.

2.1.1.  Geolocation feed individual entry fields

2.1.1.1.  IP Prefix

   REQUIRED.  Each IP prefix field MUST be either a single IP address or
   an IP prefix in CIDR notation in conformance with section 3.1 [1] of
   [RFC4632] for IPv4 or section 2.3 [2] of [RFC4291] for IPv6.

   Examples include "192.0.2.1" and "192.0.2.0/24" for IPv4 and
   "2001:db8::1" and "2001:db8::/32" for IPv6.

2.1.1.2.  Country

   OPTIONAL.  The country field, if non-empty, MUST be a 2 letter ISO
   country code conforming to ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 [ISO.3166.1alpha2].
   Parsers SHOULD treat this field case-insensitively.

   Examples include "US" for the United States, "JP" for Japan, and "PL"
   for Poland.

2.1.1.3.  Region

   OPTIONAL.  The region field, if non-empty, MUST be a ISO region code
   conforming to ISO 3166-2 [ISO.3166.2].  Parsers SHOULD treat this
   field case-insensitively.

Internet-Draft         Self-published IP Geofeeds            August 2019


   Examples include "ID-RI" for the Riau province of Indonesia and "NG-
   RI" for the Rivers province in Nigeria.

2.1.1.4.  City

   OPTIONAL.  The city field, if non-empty, SHOULD be free UTF-8 text,
   excluding the comma (',') character.

   Examples include "Dublin", "New York", and "Sao Paulo" (specifically
   "S" followed by 0xc3, 0xa3, and "o Paulo").

2.1.1.5.  Postal code

   OPTIONAL, DEPRECATED.  The postal code field, if non-empty, SHOULD be
   free UTF-8 text, excluding the comma (',') character.  The use of
   this field is deprecated; consumers of feeds should be able to parse
   feeds containing these fields, but new feeds SHOULD NOT include this
   field, due to the granularity of this information.  See Section 4 for
   additional discussion.

   Examples include "106-6126" (in Minato ward, Tokyo, Japan).

2.1.2.  Prefixes with no geolocation information

   Feed publishers may indicate that some IP prefixes should not have
   any associated geolocation information.  It may be that some prefixes
   under their administrative control are reserved, not yet allocated or
   deployed, or are in the process of being redeployed elsewhere and
   existing geolocation information can, from the perspective of the
   publisher, safely be discarded.

   This special case can be indicated by explicitly leaving blank all
   fields which specify any degree of geolocation information.  For
   example:

       192.0.2.0/24,,,,
       2001:db8:1::/48,,,,
       2001:db8:2::/48,,,,

   Historically, the user-assigned country identifier of "ZZ" had be
   used for this same purpose.  This is not necessarily preferred, and
   no specific interpretation of any of the other user-assigned country
   codes is currently defined.

Internet-Draft         Self-published IP Geofeeds            August 2019


2.1.3.  Additional parsing requirements

   Feed entries missing required fields, or having a required field
   which fails to parse correctly MUST be discarded.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that such entries also be logged for further administrative review.

   While publishers SHOULD follow [RFC5952] style for IPv6 prefix
   fields, consumers MUST nevertheless accept all valid string
   representations.

   Duplicate IP address or prefix entries MUST be considered an error,
   and consumer implementations SHOULD log the repeated entries for
   further administrative review.  Publishers SHOULD take measures to
   ensure there is one and only one entry per IP address and prefix.

   Feed entries with non-empty optional fields which fail to parse,
   either in part or in full, SHOULD be discarded.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that they also be logged for further administrative review.

   For compatibility with future additional fields, a parser MUST ignore
   any fields beyond those it expects.  The data from fields which are
   expected and which parse successfully MUST still be considered valid.

2.1.4.  Looking up an IP address

   Multiple entries which constitute nested prefixes are permitted.
   Consumers SHOULD consider the entry with the longest matching prefix
   (i.e. the "most specific") to be the best matching entry for a given
   IP address.

2.2.  Examples

   Example entries using different IP address formats and describing
   locations at country, region, and city granularity level,
   respectively:

       192.0.2.0/25,US,US-AL,,
       192.0.2.5,US,US-AL,Alabaster,
       192.0.2.128/25,PL,PL-MZ,,
       2001:db8::/32,PL,,,
       2001:db8:cafe::/48,PL,PL-MZ,,

   The IETF network publishes geolocation information for the meeting
   prefixes, and generally just comment out the last meeting information
   and append the new meeting information.  The [GEO_IETF] at the time
   of this writing contains:

       2001:67c:370::/48,CZ,CZ-10,Prague,

   Experimentally, RIPE has published geolocation information for their
   conference network prefixes, which change location in accordance with
   each new event.  [GEO_RIPE_NCC] at the time of writing contains:

       193.0.24.0/21,IS,IS-1,Reykjavik,
       2001:67c:64::/48,IS,IS-1,Reykjavik,

   Similarly, ICANN has published geolocation information for their
   portable conference network prefixes.  [GEO_ICANN] at the time of
   writing contains:

       199.91.192.0/21,ES,ES-CT,Barcelona
       2620:f:8000::/48,ES,ES-CT,Barcelona

   A longer example is the [GEO_Google] Google Corp Geofeed, which lists
   the geo-location information for Google corporate offices.

   Furthermore, it is worth noting that the geolocation data of SixXS
   users, already available at whois.sixxs.net, is now also accessible
   in the format described here (see [GEO_SIXXS]).  This can be
   particularly useful where tunnel broker networks [RFC3053] are
   concerned as:

   o  the geolocation attributes of users with neighboring prefixes can
      be quite different and therefore not easily aggregated, and

   o  attempting to learn this data by statistical analysis can be
      complicated by the likely low number of samples for any given
      user, making satisfactory statistical confidence difficult to
      achieve.

3.  Consuming self-published IP geolocation feeds

   Consumers MAY treat published feed data as a hint only and MAY choose
   to prefer other sources of geolocation information for any given IP
   prefix.  Regardless of a consumer's stance with respect to a given
   published feed, there are some points of note for sensibly and
   effectively consuming published feeds.

Internet-Draft         Self-published IP Geofeeds            August 2019


3.1.  Feed integrity

   The integrity of published information SHOULD be protected by
   securing the means of publication, for example by using HTTP over TLS
   [RFC2818].  Whenever possible, consumers SHOULD prefer retrieving
   geolocation feeds in a manner that guarantees integrity of the feed.

3.2.  Verification of authority

   Consumers of self-published IP geolocation feeds SHOULD perform some
   form of verification that the publisher is in fact authoritative for
   the addresses in the feed.  The actual means of verification is
   likely dependent upon the way in which the feed is discovered.  Ad
   hoc shared URIs, for example, will likely require an ad hoc
   verification process.  Future automated means of feed discovery
   SHOULD have an accompanying automated means of verification.

   A consumer MUST only trust geolocation information for IP addresses
   or prefixes for which the publisher has been verified as
   administratively authoritative.  All other geolocation feed entries
   MUST be ignored and SHOULD be logged for further administrative
   review.

3.3.  Verification of accuracy

   Errors and inaccuracies may occur at many levels, and publication and
   consumption of geolocation data are no exceptions.  To the extent
   practical, consumers SHOULD take steps to verify the accuracy of
   published locality.  Verification methodology, resolution of
   discrepancies, and preference for alternative sources of data are
   left to the discretion of the feed consumer.

   Consumers SHOULD decide on discrepancy thresholds and SHOULD flag for
   administrative review feed entries which exceed set thresholds.

3.4.  Refreshing feed information

   As a publisher can change geolocation data at any time and without
   notification, consumers SHOULD implement mechanisms to periodically
   refresh local copies of feed data.  In the absence of any other
   refresh timing information, it is recommended that consumers SHOULD
   refresh feeds no less often than weekly.

   For feeds available via HTTPS (or HTTP), the publisher MAY
   communicate refresh timing information by means of the standard HTTP
   expiration model (section 13.2 [3] of [RFC2616]).  Specifically,
   publishers can include either an Expires header [4] or a Cache-
   Control header [5] specifying the max-age.  Where practical,



Kline, et al.           Expires February 17, 2020               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         Self-published IP Geofeeds            August 2019


   consumers SHOULD refresh feed information before the expiry time is
   reached.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   Publishers of geolocation feeds are advised to have fully considered
   any and all privacy implications of the disclosure of such
   information for the users of the described networks prior to
   publication.  A thorough comprehension of the security considerations
   [6] of a chosen geolocation policy is highly recommended, including
   an understanding of some of the limitations of information obscurity
   [7] (see also [RFC6772]).

   As noted in Section 2.1, each location field in an entry is optional,
   in order to support expressing only the level of specificity which
   the publisher has deemed acceptable.  There is no requirement that
   the level of specificity be consistent across all entries within a
   feed.  In particular, the Postal Code field (Section 2.1.1.5) can
   provide very specific geolocation, sometimes within a building.  Such
   specific Postal Code values MUST NOT be published in geo feeds
   without the express consent of the parties being located.

5.  Relation to other work

   While not originally done in conjunction with the [GEOPRIV] working
   group, Richard Barnes observed that this work is nevertheless
   consistent with that which the group has defined, both for address
   format and for privacy.  The data elements in geolocation feeds are
   equivalent to the following XML structure (vis.  [RFC5139]):

       <civicAddress>
         <country>country</country>
         <A1>region</A1>
         <A2>city</A2>
         <PC>postal_code</PC>
       </civicAddress>

   Providing geolocation information to this granularity is equivalent
   to the following privacy policy (vis. the definition of the
   'building' [8] level of disclosure):

6.  Security Considerations

   As there is no true security in the obscurity of the location of any
   given IP address, self-publication of this data fundamentally opens
   no new attack vectors.  For publishers, self-published data merely
   increases the ease with which such location data might be exploited.

   For consumers, feed retrieval processes may receive input from
   potentially hostile sources (e.g. in the event of hijacked traffic).
   As such, proper input validation and defense measures MUST be taken.

   Similarly, consumers who do not perform sufficient verification of
   published data bear the same risks as from other forms of geolocation
   configuration errors.

   Validation of a feed's contents includes verifying that the publisher
   is authoritative for the IP prefixes included in the feed.  Failure
   to verify IP prefix authority would, for example, allow ISP Bob to
   make geolocation statements about IP space held by ISP Alice.  At
   this time only out-of-band verification methods are implemented (i.e.
   an ISP's feed may be verified against publicly available IP
   allocation data).

7.  Planned future work

   In order to more flexibly support future extensions, use of a more
   expressive feed format has been suggested.  Use of JavaScript Object
   Notation (JSON, [RFC4627]), specifically, has been discussed.
   However, at the time of writing no such specification nor
   implementation exists.  Nevertheless, work on extensions is deferred
   until a more suitable format has been selected

   The authors are planning on writing a document describing such a new
   format.  The current document describes a currently deployed and used
   format.

8.  Finding self-published IP geolocation feeds

   The issue of finding, and later verifying, geolocation feeds is not
   formally specified in this document.  At this time, only ad hoc feed
   discovery and verification has a modicum of established practice (see
   below); discussion of other mechanisms has been removed for clarity.

8.1.  Ad hoc 'well known' URIs

   To date, geolocation feeds have been shared informally in the form of
   HTTPS URIs exchanged in email threads.  The two example URIs
   documented above describe networks that change locations
   periodically, the operators and operational practices of which are
   well known within their respective technical communities.

   The contents of the feeds are verified by a similarly ad hoc process
   including:

   o  personal knowledge of the parties involved in the exchange, and

   o  comparison of feed-advertised prefixes with the BGP-advertised
      prefixes of Autonomous System Numbers known to be operated by the
      publishers.

   Ad hoc mechanisms, while useful for early experimentation by
   producers and consumers, are unlikely to be adequate for long-term,
   widespread use by multiple parties.  Future versions of any such
   self-published geolocation feed mechanism SHOULD address scalability
   concerns by defining a means for automated discovery and verification
   of operational authority of advertised prefixes.

8.2.  Other mechanisms

   Previous versions of this document referenced use of the WHOIS
   service ([RFC3912]) operated by RIRs as well as possible DNS-based
   schemes to discover and validate geofeeds.  To the authors' knowledge
   support for such mechanisms has never been implemented, and this
   speculative text has been removed to avoid ambiguity.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of the IANA.

Appendix A.  Sample Python validation code

   Included here is a simple format validator in Python for self-
   published ipgeo feeds.  This tool reads CSV data in the self-
   published ipgeo feed format from the standard input and performs
   basic validation.  It is intended for use by feed publishers before
   launching a feed.  Note that this validator does not verify the
   uniqueness of every IP prefix entry within the feed as a whole, but
   only verifies the syntax of each single line from within the feed.  A
   complete validator MUST also ensure IP prefix uniqueness.

   The main source file "ipgeo_feed_validator.py" follows.  It requires
   use of the open source ipaddr Python library for IP address and CIDR
   parsing and validation [IPADDR_PY].
