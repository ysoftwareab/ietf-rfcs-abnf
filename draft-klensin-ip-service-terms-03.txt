Abstract

   As the Internet has evolved, many types of arrangements have been
   advertised and sold as "Internet connectivity".  Because these may
   differ significantly in the capabilities they offer, the range of
   options, and the lack of any standard terminology, has caused
   considerable consumer confusion.  This document provides a list of
   terms and definitions that may be helpful to providers, consumers,
   and, potentially, regulators in clarifying the type and character of
   services being offered.

Internet-Draft              IP Service Terms                   July 2004


1.  Introduction

1.1  The Problem and the Requirement

   Different ISPs and other providers offer a wide variety of products
   that are identified as "Internet" or "Internet access".  These
   products offer different types of functionality and, as a result,
   some may be appropriate for certain users and uses and not others.
   For example, a service that offers only access to the Web, but that
   does not support any other type of Internet services, may be entirely
   appropriate for someone who is exclusively interested in browsing and
   in web-based email services, but not for someone who requires access
   to download files or make more intense use of email.  And it is
   likely to be even less appropriate for someone who requires the
   ability to operate servers for other users, who needs virtual private
   network (VPN) capabilities or other secured access to a remote
   office, or who needs to synchronize mail for offline use.

   Recent, and rapidly evolving, changes to the Internet's email
   environment have led to additional restrictions on sending and
   retrieving email.  These restrictions, most of them developed as part
   of well-intentioned attempts to prevent or fight unsolicited mail of
   various types, may be imposed independently of the service types
   described below and are discussed separately in Section 3.

   Of course, the document describes only the functions provided or
   permitted by the service provider.  It does not, and cannot, specify
   the functions that pass through and are supported by various
   user-provided equipment.

   [[Note in Draft: This paragraph to be removed by the RFC Editor if
   the document progresses that far.]] This document is a first attempt
   at establishing some definitions for these various services.  It is
   hoped that the definitions will evolve into ones that can be
   standardized and adopted widely enough to be useful to users and
   consumers.

1.2  Adoption and a Non-pejorative Terminology

   The definitions proposed here are clearly of little value if service
   providers and vendors are not willing to adopt them.  Consequently,
   the terms proposed are intended to not be pejorative, despite the
   belief of some members of the IETF community that some of these
   connectively models are simply "broken" or "not really an Internet
   service".  The mention of a particular service or model in this
   document does not imply any endorsement of it, only recognition of
   something that exists, or might exist, in the marketplace.

1.3  Definitional Terminology

   When the terms SHOULD, MUST, or MAY are used, and capitalized, in
   this document, they are used as defined in [1].

2.  General Terminology

   The terms listed in this section are the primary "IP Service Terms"
   and it is hoped that service providers will adopt them in describing
   offerings to potential users or customers.

   Terms are listed below more or less in order of ascending (to "full
   Internet") capability.  In each case, the terminology refers to the
   intent of the provider (ISP) as expressed in either technical
   measures or terms and conditions of service.  It may be possible to
   do some additional things with particular implementations of these
   characteristic connectivity types, but those flexibilities are
   generally not the intent of the provider and are unlikely to be
   supported if the workarounds stop working.

   Web connectivity.  This service provides connectivity to the web
      only.  Other services are generally not supported.  In particular,
      there may be no access to POP3 or IMAP email, encrypted tunnels or
      other VPN mechanisms.  The addresses used may not be public and
      are generally dynamic and relatively short-lived (hours or days
      rather than months or years).  These addresses are often announced
      as "dynamic" to those who keep lists of dial-up or dynamic
      addresses (see Section 3).  The provider may impose a filtering
      web proxy on the connections; that proxy may change and redirect
      URLs to other sites than the one originally specified by the user
      or embedded link.

   Client connectivity only, without a public address.  This service
      provides access to the Internet without support for server or most
      peer to peer functions.  The IP address assigned to the customer
      is dynamic and, as a distinguishing feature of this class, is
      assigned from non-public address space.  Servers and peer-to-peer
      functions are generally not supported by the network address
      translation (NAT) systems that are required by the use of private
      addresses (the more precise categorization of types of NATs given
      in [2] are somewhat orthogonal to this document but might be
      provided as additional terms as described in Section 4).
      Filtering web proxies are common with this type of service, and
      the provider SHOULD indicate whether or not one is present.

Internet-Draft              IP Service Terms                   July 2004


   Client only, public address.  This service provides access to the
      Internet without support for server or most peer to peer
      functions.  The IP address assigned to the customer in public
      address space.  It is usually nominally dynamic or otherwise
      subject to change, but may not change for months at a time.  Most
      VPN and similar connections will work with this service.  The
      provider may prohibit the use of server functions by either legal
      (contractual) restrictions or by filtering of incoming connection
      attempts.  Filtering web proxies are uncommon with this type of
      service, and the provider SHOULD indicate if one is present.

   Full Internet Connectivity.  This service provides the user full
      Internet connectivity, with one or more static public addresses.
      Dynamic addresses that are long-lived enough to make operating
      servers practical without highly dynamic DNS entries are possible,
      provided that they are not characterized as "dynamic" to third
      parties.  Filtering web proxies, interception proxies, NAT, and
      other provider-imposed restrictions on inbound or outbound ports
      and traffic are incompatible with this type of service and servers
      on a connected customer LAN are typically considered normal.  The
      only compatible restrictions are bandwidth limitations and
      prohibitions against network abuse or illegal activities.

3.  Filtering or Security Issues and Terminology

   As mentioned in the Introduction, the effort to control or limit
   objectionable network traffic including unsolicited mail of various
   types (including "spam"); worms, viruses, and their impact; and in
   some cases, specific content has led to additional restrictions on
   the behavior and capabilities of internet services.  In general,
   significant restrictions are more likely to be encountered with web
   connectivity and non-public-address services, but some current
   recommendations would apply them at all levels.  Some of these mail
   restrictions may prevent sending outgoing mail except through servers
   operated by the ISP for that purpose, may prevent use of return
   addresses of the user's choice, and may even prevent access to mail
   depositories (other than those supplied by the provider) by
   remote-access protocols such as POP3 or IMAP4.  Because users may
   have legitimate reasons to access remote file services, remote mail
   submission servers (or at least to use their preferred email
   addresses from multiple locations), and to access remote mail
   depositories (again, a near-requirement if a single address is to be
   used), it is important that providers disclose the services, filters,
   and conditions they are making available or imposing.

   Several key issues in email filtering are of particular importance:

Internet-Draft              IP Service Terms                   July 2004


   Dynamic Addresses.  A number of systems, including several
      "blacklists", are based on the assumption that most undesired
      email originated from systems with dynamic addresses, especially
      dialup and home broadband systems.  Consequently, they attempt to
      prevent the addresses from being used to send mail, or perform
      some other services, except through provider systems designated
      for that purpose.  Different techniques are used to identify
      systems with dynamic addresses, including provider advertising of
      such addresses to blacklist operators, heuristics that utilize
      certain address ranges, and inspection of reverse-mapping domain
      names to see if they contain telltale strings such as "dsl" or
      "dial".  In some cases, the absence of a reverse-mapping DNS
      address is taken as an indication that the address is "dynamic"
      (prohibition on connections based on the absence of a
      reverse-mapping DNS record was a technique developed for FTP
      servers many years ago; it was found to have fairly high rates
      both of prohibiting legitimate connection attempts and failing to
      prevent illegitimate ones).  Service providers SHOULD describe
      what they are doing in this area for both incoming and outgoing
      message traffic, and users should be aware that, if an address is
      advertised as "dynamic", it may be impossible to use it to send
      mail to an arbitrary system even if Full Internet Connectivity is
      otherwise provided.
   Non-public addresses and NATs.  The NAT systems that are used to map
      between private and public address spaces may support connections
      to distant mail systems for outbound and inbound mail, but terms
      of service often prohibit the use of systems not supplied by the
      connectivity provider as well as prohibiting the operation of
      "servers" (typically not precisely defined) on the client
      connection.
   Outbound port filtering from the provider.  Another common technique
      involves blocking connections to servers outside the provider's
      control by blocking TCP "ports" that are commonly used for
      messaging functions.  Different providers have different theories
      about this.  Some prohibit their customers from accessing external
      SMTP servers for message submission, but permit the use of the
      mail submission protocol ([3]) with sender authentication.  Others
      try to block all outgoing messaging-related protocols, including
      the use of remote mail retrieval protocols (less common with
      public-address services than those that are dependent on private
      addresses and NATs).  If this type of filtering is present,
      especially with "Client only, public address" and "Full Internet
      Connectivity" services, the provider MUST indicate that fact (see
      also Section 4).  More generally, filters that block some or all
      mail being sent to remote systems (other than via
      provider-supported servers) are, as discussed above, becoming
      common and SHOULD be disclosed.

4.  Additional Terminology

4.1  Disclaimer -- Note in Draft

   [[This subsection is to be dropped or moved (presumably in modified
   form) to an appendix before final publication.]]

   This document is a first cut.  For these definitions to be useful,
   considerable input from the IETF community, suggestions for
   additional terms, and better definitions will be required.  The
   document assumes that a single set of terms will be adequate and that
   a more complex arrangement --e.g., a matrix or array that contrasts a
   service type with address availability, presence or absence of NATs,
   etc.-- is not needed.  If something more complex _is_ needed, someone
   should propose it, although this author is very skeptical about the
   possibility of getting acceptance for a complex, multidimensional
   scheme.

   The suggestion to move the list that now appears below into a
   separate "Additional Terminology" section is due to Brian Carpenter.
   It seems to be a good solution, but comments are needed as to whether
   this gets us into the "matrix" complexity that I have been trying to
   avoid.

   Comments on the initial draft of this document suggest that the
   observations above bear repeating and some expansion.  It is easy to
   come up with cases which the terms suggested do not provide adequate
   differentiation.  Some ISPs try to block VPNs in conjunction with
   their "client only" services, others do not.  In some parts of the
   world, interception and reinterpretation of DNS queries is common, in
   others it is quite rare.  Those factors, and others, suggest that the
   simple list below could easily be expanded into a matrix or
   multidimensional array of features.  That type of list might be
   useful for people writing commercial procurement specifications, but
   it would not be useful for the "what is being advertised and what are
   you likely to get" goal of this document.  For this specification,
   anything more complex than a simple list is almost certain to be
   unusable.

   Specifically, the following distinctions have been suggested, but
   have so far been resisted by the author as adding excessive
   complication.  They are listed both for further consideration and to
   illustrate how easily things can become complicated.  Input from the
   community is, of course, desired.

   If we preserve this new model, the language of the bullet items may
   need improvement: unlike the terms above, "the service should..." may
   not be the right introductory phrase.  Suggestions solicited.

4.2  Additional Useful Terms

   These additional terms, while not as basic to understanding a service
   offering as the ones identified above, as listed as additional
   information that a service provider might choose to provide to
   complement those general definitions.  Or a potential customer might
   use those that are relevant as an in constructing a list of specific
   questions to ask.

   Version support.  The service should declare that it includes IPv4
      support only, both IPv4 and IPv6 support, or IPv6 support only.
   Authentication support.  The service should declare which technical
      mechanism(s) it uses to establish and possibly authenticate
      connections - such as unauthenticated DHCP, PPP, RADIUS, HTTP
      interception...
   VPNs and Tunnels.  Is IPSec blocked or permitted?  Are other
      tunneling techniques at the IP layer or below, such as L2TP,
      permitted?  Is there any attempt to block applications-layer
      tunnel mechanisms such as SSH?
   DNS support.  Are users required to utilize DNS servers provided by
      the service provider, or are DNS queries permitted to reach
      arbitrary servers?
   IP-related services.  Are ICMP messages to and from end user sites
      generally blocked or permitted?  Are specific functions such as
      ping and traceroute blocked and, if so, at what point in the
      network?
   Roaming support.  The service should declare whether or not it
      supports IP roaming.  [[Note in draft: this term probably needs to
      be defined sufficiently to make it useful.  Could whomever
      suggested listing it help here?]] And, for "broadband"
      connections, whether some dialup arrangement is supported for
      either backup or customer travel and whether that arrangement has
      full access to mailboxes, etc.
   Applications services provided.  The service should identify whether
      it provides email services and/or web hosting, and on what basis.
      An email services listing should identify whether POP3, IMAP, or
      web access are provided and in what combinations and what types of
      authentication and privacy services are supported or required for
      each.  Is FTP PASV supported or blocked?
   Applications blocking.  The service should declare whether it blocks
      use of SMTP or mail submission to other than its own servers and
      if its servers restrict the user to use of its domain names on
      outbound email.  Similarly, any actions of the service to block or
      restrict outbound use of other applications services should be
      identified.

Internet-Draft              IP Service Terms                   July 2004


   Filtering.  The service should declare whether it provides filtering
      or protection against worms or denial of service attacks against
      its customers, virus and UCE filtering for its mail services (if
      any), non-discretionary or "parental control" filtering of
      content, and so on.
   Wiretapping and interception.  The service should indicate whether
      traffic passing through it is subject to lawful intercept with or
      without notice?  Is traffic data stored for possible use by law
      enforcement with or without notice?

5.  Security Considerations

   This document is about terminology, not protocols, and does not raise
   any particular security issues.  However, if the type of terminology
   that is proposed is widely adopted, it may become easier to identify
   security-related expectations of particular hosts, LANs, and types of
   connections.

6.  Acknowledgements

   This document was inspired by an email conversation with Vernon
   Schryver, Paul Vixie, and Nathaniel Bornstein.  While there have been
   proposals to produce definitions like the ones above for many years,
   that conversation convinced the author that it was finally time to
   get a strawman on the table to see if the IETF could actually carry
   it forward.  Harald Alvestrand, Brian Carpenter, George Michaelson,
   Vernon Schryver, and others made several suggestions on the initial
   draft that resulted in clarifications to the second one and Stephane
   Bortzmeyer, Brian Carpenter, Pekka Savola, and Vernon Schryver made
   very useful suggestions that were incorporated into the third one.
