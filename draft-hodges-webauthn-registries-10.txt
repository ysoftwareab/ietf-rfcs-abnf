Internet-DraftRegistries for Web Authentication (WebAuthn)     June 2020


   are in the IANA Considerations section of the [WebAuthn]
   specification.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This specification establishes two registries:

   o  the "WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier" registry;
      see Section 2.1.
   o  the "WebAuthn Extension Identifier" registry; see Section 2.2.

   [[ Per discussions in an email thread between the authors and IANA (
   "[IANA #1154148]" ), it is requested that the registries be located
   at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/webauthn>.  RFC Editor - please
   delete this request after the registries have been created. ]]

   Any additional processes established by the expert(s) after the
   publication of this document will be recorded on the registry Web
   page at the expert(s)' discretion.

2.1.  WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier Registry

   WebAuthn attestation statement format identifiers are strings whose
   semantic, syntactic, and string-matching criteria are specified in
   [WebAuthn] "Attestation Statement Format Identifiers" [5], along with
   the concepts of attestation and attestation statement formats.

   Registered attestation statement format identifiers are those that
   have been added to the registry by following the procedure in
   Section 2.1.1.

   Each attestation statement format identifier added to this registry
   MUST be unique amongst the set of registered attestation statement
   format identifiers.

   Registered attestation statement format identifiers MUST be a maximum
   of 32 octets in length and MUST consist only of printable ASCII
   [RFC20] characters, excluding backslash and doublequote, i.e., VCHAR
   as defined in [RFC5234] but without %x22 and %x5c.  Attestation
   statement format identifiers are case sensitive and may not match



Hodges, et al.          Expires December 3, 2020                [Page 3]

Internet-DraftRegistries for Web Authentication (WebAuthn)     June 2020


   other registered identifiers in a case-insensitive manner unless the
   Designated Experts determine that there is a compelling reason to
   allow an exception.

2.1.1.  Registering Attestation Statement Format Identifiers

   WebAuthn attestation statement format identifiers are registered
   using the Specification Required policy (see Section 4.6 of
   [RFC8126]).

   The WebAuthn attestation statement format identifiers registry is
   located at https://www.iana.org/assignments/webauthn [6].
   Registration requests can be made by following the instructions
   located there, or by sending an e-mail to the webauthn-reg-
   review@ietf.org mailing list.

   Registration requests consist of at least the following information:

   o  WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier:
      An identifier meeting the requirements given above in Section 2.1.
   o  Description:
      A relatively short description of the attestation format.
   o  Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document or documents that specify the
      attestation statement format.
   o  Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, list the "IETF".  For others, give the
      name of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal
      address, email address, home page URI) may also be included.
   o  Notes:
      [optional]

   Registrations MUST reference a freely available, stable
   specification, e.g., as described in Section 4.6 of [RFC8126].  This
   specification MUST include security and privacy considerations
   relevant to the attestation statement format.

   Note that WebAuthn attestation statement format identifiers can be
   registered by third parties (including the expert(s) themselves), if
   the expert(s) determine that an unregistered attestation statement
   format is widely deployed and not likely to be registered in a timely
   manner otherwise.  Such registrations still are subject to the
   requirements defined, including the need to reference a
   specification.

2.1.2.  Registration Request Processing

   As noted in Section 2.1.1, WebAuthn attestation statement format
   identifiers are registered using the Specification Required policy.

   The expert(s) will clearly identify any issues that cause a
   registration to be refused, such as an incompletely specified
   attestation format.

   When a request is approved, the expert(s) will inform IANA, and the
   registration will be processed.  The IESG is the arbiter of any
   objection.

2.1.3.  Initial WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier
        Registry Values

   The initial values for the WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format
   Identifier Registry are to be populated from the values listed in
   "WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier Registrations" [7]
   of [WebAuthn].  Also, the Change Controller entry to be used for each
   of those registrations is:

   o  Change Controller: W3C Web Authentication Working Group -
      public-webauthn@w3.org

2.2.  WebAuthn Extension Identifier Registry

   WebAuthn extension identifiers are strings whose semantic, syntactic,
   and string-matching criteria are specified in [WebAuthn] "Extension
   Identifiers" [8].

   Registered extension identifiers are those that have been added to
   the registry by following the procedure in Section 2.2.1.

   Each extension identifier added to this registry MUST be unique
   amongst the set of registered extension identifiers.

   Registered extension identifiers MUST be a maximum of 32 octets in
   length and MUST consist only of printable ASCII characters, excluding
   backslash and doublequote, i.e., VCHAR as defined in [RFC5234] but
   without %x22 and %x5c.  Extension identifiers are case sensitive and
   may not match other registered identifiers in a case-insensitive
   manner unless the Designated Experts determine that there is a
   compelling reason to allow an exception.

2.2.1.  Registering Extension Identifiers

   WebAuthn extension identifiers registry are registered using the
   Specification Required policy (see Section 4.6 of [RFC8126]).

   The WebAuthn extension identifiers registry is located at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/webauthn.  Registration requests can
   be made by following the instructions located there, or by sending an
   e-mail to the webauthn-reg-review@ietf.org mailing list.

   Registration requests consist of at least the following information:

   o  WebAuthn Extension Identifier:
      An identifier meeting the requirements given above in Section 2.2.
   o  Description:
      A relatively short description of the extension.
   o  Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document or documents that specify the extension.
   o  Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, list the "IETF".  For others, give the
      name of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal
      address, email address, home page URI) may also be included.
   o  Notes:
      [optional]

   Registrations MUST reference a freely available, stable
   specification, e.g., as described in Section 4.6 of [RFC8126].  This
   specification MUST include security and privacy considerations
   relevant to the extension.

   Note that WebAuthn extensions can be registered by third parties
   (including the expert(s) themselves), if the expert(s) determine that
   an unregistered extension is widely deployed and not likely to be
   registered in a timely manner otherwise.  Such registrations still
   are subject to the requirements defined, including the need to
   reference a specification.

2.2.2.  Registration Request Processing

   As noted in Section 2.2.1, WebAuthn extension identifiers are
   registered using the Specification Required policy.

   The expert(s) will clearly identify any issues that cause a
   registration to be refused, such as an incompletely specified
   extension.

   When a request is approved, the expert(s) will inform IANA, and the
   registration will be processed.  The IESG is the arbiter of any
   objection.

2.2.3.  Initial WebAuthn Extension Identifier Registry Values

   The initial values for the WebAuthn Extension Identifier Registry are
   to be populated from the values listed in "WebAuthn Extension
   Identifier Registrations" [9] of [WebAuthn].  Also, the Change
   Controller entry to be used for each of those registrations is:

   o  Change Controller: W3C Web Authentication Working Group -
      public-webauthn@w3.org
