Internet-Draft         Reputation Queries with DNS             June 2011


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a method to query a reputation data service for
   information about an entity, using the Domain Name System (DNS).  It
   is part of a series defining the overall reputation query/response
   structure as well as the concept of reputation "vocabularies" for
   particular applications.


2.  Document Series

   This memo represents the media type registration, part of a series of
   documents that define the overall service and introduce the initial
   exemplary applications.  The series is as follows:

   1.  RFCxxxx: A Model for Reputation Interchange

   2.  RFCxxxx+1: A Media Type for Reputation Information

   3.  RFCxxxx+2: Using UDP for Reputation Interchange

   4.  RFCxxxx+3: Using the DNS for Reputation Interchange (this memo)

   5.  RFCxxxx+4: Using HTTP/XML for Reputation Interchange

   6.  RFCxxxx+5: A Reputation Vocabulary for Email Identity Reputation

   7.  RFCxxxx+6: A Reputation Vocabulary for Email Property Reputation


3.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

3.1.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.2.  Other Definitions

   Other terms of importance in this memo are defined in RFCxxxx, the
   base memo in this document series.

Internet-Draft         Reputation Queries with DNS             June 2011


4.  Description

   The [DNS] provides a distributed, fault-tolerant, extensible database
   generally used for retrieving information about services and hosts on
   the Internet.  In the recent past its ability to store arbitrary text
   data to support various applications has been exploited to store such
   information as [DKIM] keys, expressions of policy such as [ADSP] and
   [SPF], or indications of group membership such as [VBR].  This memo
   defines another such application.

   In line with [DNS-EXPAND], the TXT resource record type is used for
   this application.

4.1.  Query Format

   When constructing the name to be queried, the following steps are
   followed:

   1.   Present the subject of the reputation query, formed per the
        particular reputation application's rules, to the [SHA1]
        algorithm, producing a 20-byte blob of binary output.

   2.   Convert the binary output to a printable ASCII string by
        expressing each byte, in order, as a two-digit hexadecimal
        string.  Output this string.

   3.   Append an ASCII period (0x2E).

   4.   Append either the name of the assertion of interest, defined by
        the particular reputation application's rules, or the string
        "_any" (ASCII 0x5F, 0x61, 0x6E, 0x79) if all available
        assertions are being requested.

   5.   Append an ASCII period (0x2E).

   6.   Append the name of the reputation application within which a
        query is being made.  This name MUST be one registered with
        IANA.

   7.   Append an ASCII period (0x2E).

   8.   Append the string "_rep" (ASCII 0x5F, 0x72, 0x65, 0x70).

   9.   Append an ASCII period (0x2E).

   10.  Append the domain name that constitutes the root of the DNS sub-
        tree at which the reputation data are available.  This is the
        "base" of the reputation service.

   For example, suppose a client wishes to ask for any information the
   reputation service at "example.com" has about "example.net" within
   the context of the "email-id" application.  A hex-converted SHA1 hash
   of "example.net" is the string
   "c15fd3911e2d2a6ed98d884447782ad67fdba939".  The query would be:

   c15fd3911e2d2a6ed98d884447782ad67fdba939._any.email._rep.example.com

   The hash is done to allow arbitrarily long subjects to be encoded
   into the name of a DNS query.

4.2.  Reply Format

   The reply is formatted as one or more TXT resource records.  Replies
   not of type TXT MUST be ignored.

   The client MUST decode the TXT reply by concatenating all character-
   string (see Section 3.3 of [DNS] payloads (i.e., drop all length
   bytes) into a single composite string.  The resultant string is
   expected to be of the following form, expressed in [ABNF]:

   rep-result := rep-assertion SP rep-value SP rep-data *rep-extension

   rep-assertion := token

   rep-extension := SP token ":" token

   rep-value := ("0" / "1") [ "." 1*4DIGIT ]
             ; MUST be between 0 and 1 inclusive

   rep-data := 1*20DIGIT

   "token" is imported from [MIME].

   When the query was not about a specific assertion within the context
   of the reputation application, and thus "_any" was used, multiple TXT
   records MAY be returned, each indicating its own assertion.

   Assertions and vocabulary extensions not registered as part of the
   reputation application in use MUST be ignored.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo presents no actions for IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This memo describes security considerations introduced by the media
   type defined here.

6.1.  General

   This memo is part of a series introducing a reputation query and
   response system (see Section 2).  The Security Considerations
   sections of the other memos should also be consulted.
