Abstract 
    
   SS7 ISUP [3] defines a Calling Party's Category (CPC) parameter that 
   characterizes the station used to originate a call and carries other 
   important state that can describe the originating party. Based on the 
   CPC parameter from the calling network, the called network can do 
   some special processes related to the calling party category, just 
   like override the calee's DND and some other barring services.

1. Introduction 
    
   The Do Not Disturb (DND) supplementary service allows the served user 
   to instruct the network to automatically reject incoming calls 
   because he does not want to be disturbed. 
    
   The Anonymous Call Rejection (ACR) supplementary service allows the 
   served user to reject incoming calls from users or subscribers who 
   have restricted the presentation of their calling party identifier. 
    
   DND and ACR are popular supplementary services in the public switch 
   telephone network (PSTN) and have already been used by a great number 
   of subscribers. 
    
   But there are some provisions for exceptional cases that the calling 
   party should have the opportunity to override the DND or ACR service 
   to reach the called party even though the services are activated and 
   the service-specific conditions are met. For an instance, a call from 
   a police station, emergency call center or from an operator who has 
   the rights to override the served user's services. 
    
   SS7 ISUP [3] defines a Calling Party's Category (CPC) parameter that 
   characterizes the station used to originate a call and carries other 
   important state that can describe the originating party. Based on the 
   CPC parameter from the calling network, the called network can do 
   some special processes related to the calling party category, just 
   like the cases described above.

Internet-Draft      Calling party category in SIP        October 2005 
 
 
   This document defines a new header to deliver the calling party 
   category. 
    
      The draft [8] defines a URI parameter, "cpc", to deliver the CPC 
      parameter. But the calling party category is always required to be 
      considered as a part of the caller's profile or subscription. That 
      is, the calling network must know the detail of it and it must be 
      asserted by the network if it is provided by the calling party 
      station. So, it is better that only the network equipments add, 
      remove or read and process it, and in this case it is better to 
      deliver such a parameter by a separated header field. 
    
2. Conventions 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [4]. 
    
3. The P-CPC header field 
    
   The P-CPC header field MAY appear in any request out of a dialog.  
   The syntax of the header field follows the standard SIP header syntax. 
    
      P-CPC         = "P-CPC" HCOLON cpc-value 
                      *( SEMI cpc-param ) 
      cpc-value     = "ordinary" / "operator" / "test" / "payphone" / 
                      "prison" / "hotel" / "hospital" / "police" / 
                      "cellular" / "cellular-roaming" / "freecharge" / 
                      "data" / "unknown" / token 
      cpc-param     = cpc-pname [ "=" cpc-pvalue ] 
      cpc-pname     = 1*paramchar 
      cpc-pvalue    = 1*paramchar 
 
   The "paramchar" is defined in RFC3261 [1]. 
    
   The semantics of these Calling Party Category values are described 
   below: 
      ordinary: The caller has been identified, and has no special 
      features. 
      operator: The call was generated by an operator position. 
      test: This is a test call that has been originated as part of a 
      maintenance procedure. 
      payphone: The calling station is a payphone. 
      prison: The calling station is in a prison. 
      hotel: The calling station is in a hotel or motel. 
      hospital: The calling station is in a medical facility. 
      police: The calling station is associated with a branch of law 
      enforcement. 
      cellular: The calling station is a radio-telephone operating in

      its home network. 
      cellular-roaming: The calling station is a radio-telephone roaming 
      in another network 
      freecharge: The caller is a free-charge subscriber. 
      data: The calling station is a data station. 
      unknown: The CPC could not be ascertained. 
    
   To enables the network received the P-CPC header do some special 
   process based on the calling party category, the P-CPC header is 
   should only appear in the request message out of a dialog. 
    
4. Usage 
    
   The calling party category is always related to the caller service 
   profile or subscription, that’s why only the network server should be 
   responsible for keeping and providing this information to all the 
   others who need it. 
    
   Because the network server is responsible for setting/adding the P-
   CPC header, this operation cannot be performed by the calling user 
   endpoints.  
    
   This calling party category information belongs to the caller's
   profile and if provided by the caller endpoint it must be asserted by 
   the originating network. 
   Because of the need for strict authenticity of this header, it is 
   recommended that only the network server should be able to add, 
   remove and process it, through an independent header field. 
    
   After receiving the request from the caller endpoint, the network 
   server should add the P-CPC header into the request before it is 
   transferred across to the called network.  
    
   When a network server receives this request from another network 
   server and the P-CPC header field is found to be absent. In this case 
   the receiving network server would consider the calling party 
   category of this request as "ordinary" by default 
    
    
   To ensure trusted behavior in the system, the caller network server 
   must overwrite any existing P-CPC header in the incoming request from 
   the caller's endpoint.

Internet-Draft      Calling party category in SIP        October 2005 
 
 
   Once the request reaches the called party network, the called party 
   network server can do some special processing related to the calling 
   party category information, for example implementing the DND and ACR 
   override by the caller if his category is "police". 
    
   The calling party category information is sensitive and the called 
   network server should remove it and ensure this information is not 
   transferred to the called user endpoint.  
    
5. Security Considerations 
    
   The information contained in the P-CPC header may be of a private 
   nature, and it may not be appropriate for this value to be revealed 
   to the destination user (typically it would not be so revealed in the 
   PSTN). To reach this, before sending the request to the called party 
   endpoint, the server, any logical entity it is, should remove this 
   header and maybe some other sensitive information also. 
    
   Otherwise, this mechanism adds no new security considerations to 
   those discussed in [1]. 
    
6. IANA Considerations 
    
   This extension defines a new header field: 
   Name of Header:          P-CPC 
   Short form:              none
