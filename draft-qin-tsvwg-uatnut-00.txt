      Upload Acceleration Transport Network for Upstream Traffics
                       draft-qin-tsvwg-uatnut-00

Abstract

   Photos, videos and other upstream traffics generated by end users are
   rapidly increasing these days and expected to continue doing so in
   the future.  A lot of factors, such as long round-trip-time (RTT),
   low robustness of delivery, and transport bottlenecks, etc., lead to
   low upload rate, which cause poor user experiences.  This draft
   discusses an Upload Acceleration Transport Network(UATN) for upstream
   traffics that use distributed cache servers and separates the upload
   transaction into two parts for greater network efficiency.

1.  Introduction

   Traditional Internet data services are frequently that end users
   download content from data centers or Content Service Providers
   (CSPs) distribute content to their end users, so traffic volume
   generated by end users account for very small proportion of all
   Internet traffics.  However, as mobile phones and other smart devices
   are proliferating, above status is changing since more and more end
   users like directly uploading and sharing their photos, videos or
   other documents by data centers.  Besides, mobile devices emerging
   are fully cloud-dependent that are not equipped with much storage but
   rely on large storage in data centers.  For these reasons, a large

   number of Online Storage Service Providers(OSSPs),Photos Sharing
   Service Providers (PSSPs), and Videos Sharing Service Providers
   (VSSPs) emerge at a historic moment so that make upstream traffics
   rapidly increasing and expected to continue doing so in the future.

   To overcome this challenge of massive upstream traffic, just
   installing more data servers will not be enough[RFC6392].  Moving
   data server closer to the end users results in greater network
   efficiency: improved Quality of Service (QoS), increased robustness
   of delivery,and lower latency.  In these existing work, Content
   Delivery Networks (CDNs) are a representative technique.  However,
   CDNs focus on downstream traffic and are used to deliver large-scale
   content from data center to end users while do not necessarily apply
   to upstream traffics[RFC6707].  Since lack of this edge technologies,
   when end users request to upload content to data center, they may
   have to face a long "data path", such as Telecommunication Service
   Provider's Network(TSPN), Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), Wide
   Area Networks (WANs), etc., which may worsen the upload environment
   and force end users to stay tethered to the network for long time.
   Even over a relatively long distance, throughput may go from maximum
   to nothing.  According to the report in [1], throughput measurements
   from over 1.5 million mobile devices have shown that compared with an
   average downstream throughput of over 1860 Kbps, the average upstream
   throughput is only about 430 Kbps.  This is because of the adoption
   of cache techniques such as CDNs to acelerate downloading large
   content that moves the "content" closer to end users.

   For improving the user experience of upload, it is worthwhile and in
   fact extremely important to consider an acceleration approach for
   upload service like their download counterparts.  It is generally
   desirable that a given content item generated by one user can be
   quickly and robustly uploaded to data centers regardless of that end
   user's location or attachment network.  This is the motivation for
   establishing UATN so it can provide open content delivery
   infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery of content from end user
   to data center.  However, no standards or open specifications
   currently exist to facilitate such acceleration transport network.

   The goal of this document is to figure out how to build a UATN for
   upstream traffics to provide improved quality of user experienceand
   reduced delivery cost.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

   Upload Service Provider (USP):The service provider who operates data
   servers or cloud service that allows end users to directly upload or



Qin, et al.             Expires November 29, 2015               [Page 3]

   share their content, such as photos, videos, or other documents
   generated by them.  The content may be stored temporarily, or
   downloaded by other end users,or directly forwarded to another end
   user.  Note that a given entity may operate in more than one role.
   For example, a company may simultaneously operate as a USP,a CSP, and
   a CDN Provider, etc.

   Upload Acceleration Transport Network (UATN): A transport network
   between end users and data centers that enables cache servers to
   provide content upload services on behalf of the USP.  A UATN may be
   wholly or partially realized through a set of cache servers and
   transport system with control and communication components.

   UATN Provider: The service provider who operates a UATN and offers a
   service of content upload acceleration, typically used by USPs.  Note
   that a given entity may operate in more than one role.  For example,a
   company may simultaneously operate as a USP,a CDN Provider, and a
   UATN Provider, etc.

2.  Use Cases and Scenarios

2.1.  End User to Data Center Use Case

   An example is depicted in Figure 1, where USP has deployed its own
   UATN or established an agreement with UATN Provider for the uploading
   of this content.  When a given end user requests uploading content to



Qin, et al.             Expires November 29, 2015               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    upload acceleration transport network         May 2015


   USP's data center, the UATN may allow the end user to directly upload
   the content to its cache server.  UATN also selects the optimum cache
   server to serve this uploading.  For instance, UATN considers that
   the Cache-1 is appropriate, because Cache-1 is an access cache and
   the end user is directly attached to it[RFC6770].  Through the UATN
   arrangements put in place between USP and end user(as a result of the
   upload acceleration service agreement established between USP and
   UNTA Provider),UATN can redirect the request to Cache-1 and the
   content is actually delivered to the USP's data center by UATN.

   End users benefit from this arrangement through a better
   QoE[RFC6390], because the content is uploaded to a nearby surrogate
   (e.g., lower latency, bottlenecks avoided)[RFC6707].  USPs benefit
   because they do not need to deploy such an extensive data server,
   they only need to make one business agreement and one technical
   arrangement with UATN Provider, but their end users can get a high
   service quality.  TSPs benefit because they do not need to expand the
   uplink bandwidth, and the upstream throughputs can be improved from
   end use's perspective.  To extend the example, other ASPs, such as
   CDN Providers may also benefit from this arrangement.  They can make
   their existing CDNs to provide upload services so that the upstream
   bandwidth can be fully used, and may receive some compensation for
   the delivery.

2.2.  End User to End User Use Case

   In this scenario, USP wishes to allow content delivery among its end
   users with high speed.  Consider the following example,illustrated in
   Figure 2: EU-1 wants to deliver content to EU-2, however, there may
   have a long "data path" between EU-1 and EU-2, such as TSPN, MANs,
   WANs, etc.  This will cause large delay and inversely proportional
   TCP throughput.  One technique for improving the user seen throughput
   is to introduce UATN between the sender and the receiver.  UATN
   resolves the problem by separating the current delivery communication
   into two parts, front-end service from the EU-1(the sender) to UATN
   and back-end service from the UATN to EU-2 (the receiver) to reduce
   access network and/or inter-network hop delay.

   As an example, suppose a French person wants to deliver content to
   the end user located in Africa.  The USP of this French user can ask
   a UATN Provider to provide acceleration that content generated by the
   French people will be first forwarded to the UATN Cache-1 and then is
   delivered to UATN Cache-2 through UATN's high reliability and
   performance transport system.  At last, the content is actually
   deliver to African user by UATN's Cache-2.

2.3.  Footprint Extension Use Cases

   In this use case, the USPs want to extend the infrastructure to
   support active users rapid growth:

   o  without compromising the quality of upload.

   o  keeping additional transit and other network costs at a reasonable
      level that receives content from geographically or topologically
      remote end users.

   o  without incurring the cost of deploying and operating data centers
      and the associated infrastructure that may not be justified in the
      corresponding geographic region (e.g., because of relatively low
      delivery volume, or conversely because of the high investments
      that would be needed to satisfy the high volume).

   In addition,if USPs have a geographically limited footprint (e.g.,
   restricted to one country), or do not serve all end users in a
   geographic area, they can also establish an agreement with a UATN
   Provide to provide their services beyond their own footprint.

   As an example, suppose a French USP wants to provider upload service
   to end users located in various countries in North Africa.  It can
   make an agreement with UATN Provider that covers North Africa instead
   of deploying its own data center in North Africa.  Overall, from the
   end use's perspective, the French USP provides an upload service for
   the whole North Africa with high data rate.  If there are several
   USPs that have make an agreement with the UATN Provider, cost will
   keep at a reasonable level, as shown in Figure 3.

2.4.  Offload Use Case

   A USP's access server or servers is/are likely to be dimensioned to
   support an expected maximum traffic load.  However, unexpected spikes
   in content popularity (flash crowd) may drive load beyond the
   expected peak.  The USP may use UATN so that some requests may be
   redirected to UATN to increase its effective capacity during the peak
   of traffic.

   For example, a USP can offload traffic to UATN for the duration of a
   specific maintenance operation or a special event, as in the scenario
   depicted in Figure 4.  For instance, during a major event, such as a
   celebrity's wedding or a major sport competition, many people in a
   confined space may deliver and upload photos, video related to this
   event, the USP and TSP are likely to experience a flash crowd during
   the event and will need to offload traffic.  While UATN can support a
   more typical traffic load and be able to handle the offloaded
   traffic.

3.  Upload Acceleration Transport Network Approach

   The UATN is a distributed system consisting of lots of widely
   deployed servers to enable the delivery of highly scalable
   distributed applications.  UATN is comprised of multiple delivery
   networks, each tailored to a different type of content.  For example,
   picture content, streaming media, or static web content.  At a high

   level, UATN shares a similar architecture, which is shown in
   Figure 5, but the underlying technology and implementation of each
   system component may differ in order to best suit the specific type
   of content.

   The main components of UATN are as follows:

   When the user types a USP's domain name into his/her browser, the
   domain name is translated by the mapping system into the IP address
   of an edge server to serve the content (arrow I).  The mapping system
   should collect and analysis historical and current data regarding the
   virtual network and server conditions.  This data is used to choose
   an edge server that is located close to the end user.

   Each edge server is part of the edge server platform, a distributed
   deployment of servers located in many sites.  These servers are
   responsible for processing requests from nearby EUs and receiving
   content generated by them (arrow 2).

   In order to respond to a request from a user, the UATN must deliver
   the content stored by edg server/servers to the designated data
   center.  The transport system is used to deliver content between edge
   server platform and designated data center in a reliable and
   efficient manner.  More generally, the transport system is
   responsible for moving data and content over the long-haul Internet
   with high reliability and performance.

   The communications and control system is used for disseminating
   status information, control messages, and configuration updates in a
   fault-tolerant and timely fashion.

   Finally, the user control portal serves two functions.  First, it
   provides a configuration management platform that allows a USP to
   retain fine-grained control how the content is uploaded to their data
   center by the end user.  These configurations can be told timely to
   the edge platform via the communications and control system.  Note
   that this configuration management applies to the third party UATN
   providers, if a USP deploys its own UATN, the configuration
   management platform can be omitted.  In addition, the user control
   portal provides a redirection approach of user request that redirects
   the upload request to the UATN.

   While all of UATN incorporates the component outlined above, the
   specific design of each system is influenced by application
   requirements.  For instance, the transport system of a UATN will have
   a different set of requirements and a different architecture.

4.  New Protocol Considerations

   This document does not call for changes or additions: any new
   session, transport or network protocols; new protocols for delivering
   content from a UATN to an End User/User agent; new protocols for
   ingestion of content between a UATN and a USP.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document focuses on approach and the motivational use cases for
   UATN, and does not analyze the associated threats.  Those threats
   will be discussed in future.

6.  Acknowledgments

   The authors wish to thank David Black, Linlin Zhou, and Guangqing
   Deng for their invaluable comments.
