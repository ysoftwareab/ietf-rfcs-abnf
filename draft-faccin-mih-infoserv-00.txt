Abstract

   Work within the IEEE's 802.21 working group is aimed at providing
   media independent handover service, to assist with handovers between
   heterogeneous link-layer technologies, and across upper-layer subnet
   boundaries.

   In order to provide canonical mechanism for media independent
   handover information to link-layer devices, an information service

   envisaged as part of the 802.21 solution.

   This document is a personal effort amongst attendees to solicit
   assistance from IETF contributors to determine which components of
   the information service are already available, and the form of the
   components which still require protocol development.

Internet-Draft        Some Requirements for an MIIS            June 2005


1.  Introduction

   The current working document for media independent handover services
   in the IEEE 802.21 working group aims at providing information to
   assist upper-layer configuration at handover time [1].  In order to
   further assist handover decision planning, a Media Independent
   Information Service (MIIS) is envisaged in the working document,
   which would provide topological and location related information to
   end devices' Layer-2 media independent handover function (MIHF).

   The data received in the Media Independent Handover Function would be
   passed to interested upper layer protocols, potentially filtered for
   content, as is appropriate.

   In order to support different deployment topologies, the current
   working document suggests that the Media Independent Information
   Service runs over Upper-Layer protocols such as IP (with other upper-
   layer protocols).

   This document describes one distillation of the requirements from the
   current working document for 802.21's media independent information
   service, in order to elicit expert advice from IETF participants in
   developing such a network-layer and above embodiment of the protocol.

1.1  The Current 802.21 Working Document

   802.21 has recently harmonized on a proposal which has been accepted
   as a basis for standardizing a Media Independent Handover (MIH)
   Service.  This has resulted in a working document, which is aimed at
   providing a framework for implementation of MIH service access points
   (SAPs) to interface with upper layer protocols, as well as interfaces
   for communicating handover centric information between peer 802 or
   cellular network entities [1].

   The information exchanges are classified as either Event, Command or
   Information services.

   Event services provide immediate communications to within an MIHF or
   to a peer MIHF on the other end of the Link-layer medium.  Events
   indicate that changes are occurring in the wireless environment: for
   example, that it is now possible to send generic upper-layer frames.

   Command services are instructions from upper layer handover
   controlling entities to change the state of the wireless link, and
   may be sent within a stack, or passed to a peer MIH entity on the
   other side of a wireless link.  For example: The network may be able
   to instruct a station to handover to another network.

   Such command mechanisms may cause further event generation, either
   from the local Medium Independent Handover Function, or on the peer.

   The Media Independent Information Service distinguishes itself from
   the other mechanisms in that the messages are typically larger and do
   not have the same time critical delivery requirements.

   Also, the endpoint for remote communication may be a device other
   than the directly adjacent link-layer peer.  As described in the
   working document, in this case, it is believed an upper-layer
   protocol should be used to deliver information.

   In that case, it is possible that network information may be either
   centrally stored on a server or distributed in each individual access
   network.  Presumably, an L2 or L3 based mechanism to identify or
   discover a valid information server would be required.

1.2  Media Independent Information Service Description

   The media independent information service provides three classes of
   data to mobile hosts:

   1.  General Network Information (GNI): A general overview of the
       network and its nearby Points of Attachment.

   2.  Link Layer Information (LLI): Link-layer specific information
       useful to identify capabilities of a specific network.

   3.  Higher Layer Information (HLI): Information about upper layer
       protocols like IPv4 and IPv6, configuration systems such as DHCP
       and mobility management applications like MIPv4 [2][5].

   The information service is primarily a request/response based system,
   with potential unsolicited multicast over raw link-layer transports
   in some situations (not necessarily relevant to IETF though).

   The information service processes queries containing a set of filter
   constraints on the response, as specified by the requester.

   It then composes a response and sends it back to the requester.

   Given the size and non-real time nature of the response, more than
   one packet of data may be required to transport all the information
   required.

1.3  Information flows

   As mentioned earlier, the are different incarnations of the

   Information Service depending on whether information is being passed
   between two link-layer peers, or is stored on a server accessible
   over an upper-layer protocol such as IP.

   While this document is concerned solely with the L3 and above
   transport for MIH's information service, the information flow for
   both L2 and L3 based exchanges are presented for comparison:

              |   confirm|                    |            |

   Note that the primary logical differences between the information
   flows at the link-layer and upper layers are the endpoints for
   message transport.  The use of a particular mechanism should be
   transparent to systems interfacing to the MIH Service Access Point.

   As described in section 6.3.4 of the 802.21 working document, as in
   the above figure:

   "MIIS within MIHF (MIH Function)  is communicating with the remote
   MIHF that is residing either within the access network or in the core
   network..." [1].

   Further discussion within the IEEE 802.21 Cairns interim meeting
   identified that forwarded (multi-hop) delivery may be needed in some
   cases, if IP is the basis for the upper-layer transport if
   information services.

2.  Media Independent Handover Services

   The union of the Media Independent Information Service, the Media
   Independent Event Serviced and the Media Independent Command Service
   compose a Media Independent Handover Service.

   Certain characteristics are shared amongst all three services.  Of
   particular note are the common SAPs, message formats and data schema.

2.1  Requirements for an MIH Information Service

   The MIIS needs to be in a position to provide useful information to
   hosts about their current visited environments.  In many cases, the
   network side infrastructure is in a position to store overall network
   information, such as neighborhood cell lists and the location of
   mobile devices.

Internet-Draft        Some Requirements for an MIIS            June 2005


   This provides an information model and an information repository to
   make more effective handover decisions.  The mobile terminal accesses
   information from this repository using it's current network point of
   attachments.

   Apart from periodic updates when configuration change occurs, the
   client requests reports containing pertinent information from a
   remote MIIS entity.  In order for upper layer protocol entities to
   provide queries, on the client, request messages are passed down
   through the MIH_SAP.  When a response arrives, or if a failure
   occurs, a response is passed back up through the SAP.

3.  MIHS SAP Relations

   The MIHF provides a unified SAP for its component services to upper
   layers such as IPv6, or mobility management applications, like MIPv6
   [3][4][6].  These applications are saved the difficulty of dealing
   with individual Link-layer modules for handover control and
   monitoring.

   Within the MIHS, each of the entities is able to interface to media
   dependent operations in order to gain information from or provide
   control over the physical medium and MAC.

   In the diagram below, the MIIS is shown as being able to interface to
   upper layer protocols, in order to provide information service data
   transport.

4.  Message formats for MIHS

   In order to make carriage of data simple and consistent in all media,
   a format has been defined in common for media independent message
   transfer.

   While both L2 specific and network (and above) layer transport are
   envisaged for the MIHS, both services define a common message format
   which is specialized for each of the MIHF components.

   The message format below is one for MIIS.  The primary differences
   between MIIS format and the command and event services are the MIH
   Service ID field, and the Language Coding and Character Coding
   fields.  The latter two only appear in Information Service messages.

   Information service messages, with individual operations providing
   being distinguished using the Opcode, and response matching delivered
   by the Transaction ID.

   The Identifier Length provides an identifier length for both source
   and destination.

   For MIIS messages, the MIH Service ID is set to three, and it is
   proposed that the first four octets of the message body define
   together the query language in use, and the text message encoding for
   responding strings sent to upper layer applications.

   The use of query language identification indicates that no single
   content format exists for the MIIS.  Example schema for RDF (SPARQL)
   and ASN.1 are provided in sections 6.3.3.2.1 and 6.3.3.2.2 of the
   802.21 working document [8][9].  Additional formats are considered
   possible in 9.4.5 of the same draft.

5.  MIIS SAP Structure

   Two messages are defined on the MIH_SAP for the Intformation service:

Internet-Draft        Some Requirements for an MIIS            June 2005


   "MIH_Information.request" and "MIH_Information.response".

   The elements of these services are defined below.

5.1  MIH_Information.request

   The request operation in the MIH Information Service SAP allows
   various pieces of information to be requested and filtered by the
   responding information service.

   below is a list of the parameters for the request.

   MIH_Information.request
   (
   InfoQueryFilter,
   InfoQueryParameters
   )

   The InfoQueryFilter provides a set of limitations to the response
   information, so that only information which is interesting to the
   querier is transmitted across the network, and passed to
   applications.  Elements for the filters are summarized in
   Section 5.3.

   InfoQueryParameters provide the specific control of which data are
   interesting to a particular mobile device.

   Examples in the 802.21 working document describe use of SPARQL
   Queries within InfoQueryParameters, using storage in an
   'FILTER_INTO_DATA' InfoQueryFilter [8][9].  Additionally
   specification of EAP in the InfoQueryParameters is described in the
   802.21 document section 7.4.15.3.

   Interested parties are invited to look at the query schema defined in
   the working document [1].

5.2  MIH_Information.response

   The response message contains the contents of the reply from the peer
   Information Service.

   Occasionally, this message will not respond with useful information,
   for example if the response comes from the local MIIS entity in
   communicating failure cases, the success and failure of a the query
   is stored in the status field.

Internet-Draft        Some Requirements for an MIIS            June 2005


   MIH_Information.response
   (
   InfoQueryFilter,
   MIH_REPORT,
   status
   )

   The InfoQueryFilter exhibits the same properties as when used in a
   request.

   The status determines if the query was successful or not.

   The MIH report is passed as a textual string (assuming XML rendering
   of the content).

5.3  InfoQueryFilter Elements

   Query filters are applied to MIIS information queries and responses.
   They limit the data which is passed through to the upper-layer
   protocol through the SAP.  They also limit the amount of data
   provided by the MIIS in response to queries.

   Query filters come in three classes aligned with the network
   information classes.  The tables of filters below have been
   reproduced from section 7.4.14.1 of the 802.21 working document [1].

   o  GNI:

      FILTER_INFO_ALL_NETWORKS: Get Info about all networks

      FILTER_INFO_802_NETWORK:  Get info about all 802 networks

      FILTER_INFO_GSM_NETWORK:  Get info about only GSM networks

      FILTER_INFO_CDMA_NETWORK: Get info about only GSM networks

   o  LLI:

      FILTER_INFO_ALL_ELEMENTS:        Get info about all information
         elements

      FILTER_INFO_ELEMENT_MAC_ADDRESS: Get info about only the MAC
         Address

      FILTER_INFO_ELEMENT_SECURITY:    Get info about only the security

   o  HLSI:

      FILTER_INFO_ALL_SERVICE_PROVISION: Get info about higher layer
         services

      FILTER_INFO_ELEMENT_ISP:           Get info about the ISP

      FILTER_INFO_VPN_SUPPORT:           Indicates the support of VPN

      FILTER_INFO_MIP_SUPPORT:           Indicates the support of MIP

   Additional Filter mechanisms and requests are defined in the current
   802.21 working document.  These are primarily to allow flexible
   querying using a language such as SPARQL [9].

   The following values are defined in section 7.4.14.3 of [1]:

   FILTER_INFO_DATA:       This filter is a query and response filter
      for the SPARQL Database query language (defined in XML/RDF).

   FILTER_INFO_SCHEMA_URL: This filter is used to determine if non-
      mandatory portions of the schema are implemented (the extended
      schema), which schema they are and identifies where this data is
      kept.

   FILTER_INFO_SCHEMA:     Used to retrieve templates for queries on the
      extended schema.


5.4  Query Mechanisms and Formats

   At this stage, both MIB and SPARQL (RDF/XML) schema have been
   specified in the 802.21 working document [8][9].

   It may be useful to determine if similar or more appropriate systems
   are used for information services within the IETF development stream.
   (If such tools exist).

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA provide registry services for a large number of protocol
   identifiers used within IETF-related protocols.

   The IEEE standards association maintains its own registries for
   organizationally unique identifiers, ethertypes, and logical link
   control identifiers.

   This document does not in itself cause changes or demands to be

Internet-Draft        Some Requirements for an MIIS            June 2005


   placed upon the IANA or IEEE registries.

   Subsequent development of standards which may reference or create
   IANA or IEEE registries have the potential induce changes of loads
   particular registries.

   Proposals for Media Independent Information Services need to ensure
   that any envisaged use development of registries are compatible with
   the registry operation's charter and resources.

7.  Security Considerations

   Exchange of Link-layer related information over upper-layer protocols
   such as IP has the potential effect of widening the scope of attacks
   against both the information service's interfaces with the network,
   and the information itself.

7.1  Attacks against service entities

   Attacks against the information service become possible where
   information which would be limited to only one medium or bridge span,
   is subsequently available through an arbitrarily large IP subnet.

   Additionally, where information service packets may be requested or
   supplied from beyond the boundaries of a single routed hop, the
   potential scope for attack upon either of the (client or server) MIIS
   entities is Internet-wide.

   Discovery of the information server is implied as a requirement in
   providing information services over upper-layer protocols.  Where the
   server is indicated through link-layer signalling, the robustness of
   the discovery mechanism is largely based on the security of the
   existing link-layer signaling mechanisms.  Where the server discovery
   is performed over IP, special care needs to be taken to ensure that
   discovery may not be hijacked, especially since the underlying
   wireless medium may in some cases be considered vulnerable to such
   attack.

   Attacks upon these services may prevent one or more devices being
   unable to receive handover related information.  As such this may
   cause degradation in handover performance.

7.2  Attacks against information

   Attacks against the information exchanged between the information
   service and the information client may potentially modify the
   behaviour and trust of the client protocol stack.




Daley & Faccin          Expires December 30, 2005              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        Some Requirements for an MIIS            June 2005


   Where the integrity and origin of the information delivered to the
   client is not verifiable, the value of the information is degraded,
   as hosts are less able to rely upon the data received.

   Where the client's request is spoofed or modified, additional
   information may be sent to the MIHF on the client.  As the client is
   typically upon a lower bandwidth medium than the server, there exists
   potential to deny service to devices on that medium.

   Systems which ensure proofs of identity and message integrity may be
   able to remove or mitigate some of these effects, by ensuring that
   data arrives as intended back to the client.  It may be difficult,
   though, to bootstrap some types of security association considering a
   potential lack of keying material, computation and network bandwidth
   resources from mobile devices.

Appendix A.  Relevant Statements in 802.21 Working Document

   S 5.1.4: ... it is necessary that 802.21 defines the network
      information and specifies the means by which such information can
      be obtained for supported access networks and made available to
      the upper layers.

   S 5.1.4: The network information could include information about link
      type, link identifier, link availability, link quality, etc.

   S 5.1.8: facilitated by providing ... timely information about
      overlay micro-cells and macro-cells.

   S 5.1.9: Media Independent Information Service (MIIS) which provides
      details on the characteristics and services provided by the
      serving and surrounding networks.  The information enables
      effective system access and effective handover decisions.

   S 5.4: The interaction with ...  Information service will be through
      synchronous query and response type of mechanisms.

   S 5.4.3: MIIS primarily provides a set of information elements (IEs),
      the information structure and its representation and a query/
      response type of mechanism for information transfer.

   S 5.4.3: This (note: MIIS Query/Response) contrasts with the
      asynchronous push model of information transfer for the event
      service.

   S 5.4.3: The information may be stored within the (note: local or
      peer L2) MIH functional (MIHF) entity or maybe present in some
      information server from where the MIH in the station can access
      it.

   S 5.4.3: The information can be made available via both lower as well
      as higher layers.  Information can be made available at L2 through
      both a secure and an insecure port.

   S 5.4.3: Information available through insecure port would typically
      be less sensitive and would allow the mobile terminal to make a
      quick handover decision before incurring the overhead of
      authentication and establishing a secure L2 connection with the
      network.

   S 5.4.3: In certain scenarios L2 information may not be available or
      sufficient to make intelligent handover decision.  In such cases,
      higher layer information service is required.

   S 5.4.3: The capability of such network information service can be
      obtained via schema access.  The structure and definition of a
      schema can be represented in a high level language such as XML.

   S 5.4.3: While selecting for an appropriate syntax for information
      exchange it is desired that:

      *  the information exchange should be done fast

      *  the overhead in exchange of information should be as less as
         possible

      *  the extraction of the information at the terminal should not
         include high computational complexity

Internet-Draft        Some Requirements for an MIIS            June 2005


   S 5.4.3: The information provided by Information service conforms to
      structure and semantics specified within 802.21.  The Media
      Independent Information service specifies a common (or media
      independent) way of representing this information across different
      technologies by using a standardized format such as XML or ASN.1

   S 5.4.3: MIIS provides the ability to access this information about
      all heterogeneous networks in a geographical area from any single
      L2 network, depending on how the 802.21 MIIS service is
      implemented.

   S 5.4.3: MIIS either relies on existing access media specific
      transports and security mechanisms or L3 transport and L3 security
      mechanisms to provide access to the information.

   S 5.4.3: How this information (IEs?) is developed and deployed in a
      given L2 network is outside the scope of the standard.

   S 5.4.3: A media independent neighbor graph may be abstracted
      obtaining the neighbor reports from media specific technology,
      however, the generation and maintenance of this media independent
      neighbor graph is out of scope of 802.21.

   S 5.4.3: Some networks such as the cellular networks already have an
      existing means of detecting a list of neighborhood base stations
      within the vicinity of an area via the broadcast control channel.
      Other IEEE groups define similar means and supports clients in
      detecting a list of neighborhood access points within the vicinity
      of an area via either beaconing,  or via broadcast of MAC
      management messages.

   S 5.4.3: The Media Independent Information Service (MIIS) provides a
      unified framework to help the higher layer mobility protocols
      (HLMP) across the heterogeneous network environment to facilitate
      the client's discovery and selection of multiple types of networks
      existing within a geographical area.

   S 5.4.3: In the larger scope, the macro objective (note: of MIIS) is
      to help the higher layer mobility protocol to acquire a global
      view of the heterogeneous networks to facilitate seamless handover
      when roaming across these networks.

   S 5.4.3: The Information service also provides access to static
      information such as neighbor reports.  This information helps in
      network discovery.

Internet-Draft        Some Requirements for an MIIS            June 2005


   S 5.4.3: The service may also provide access to dynamic information
      which may optimize link layer connectivity with different
      networks.  This could include link layer parameters such as
      channel information, MAC addresses, security information, etc.
      Information about available higher layer services in a network may
      also help in more effective handover decision making before the
      mobile terminal actually attaches to any particular network.

   S 5.6.1: MIH_MGMT_SAP

      This defines the interface between the MIH Function layer and the
      management plane of different networks.  This SAP can be used for
      sending MIH messages between MIH Function and local link layer
      entities as well as between peer MIH Function entities.  Messages
      based on management frames can be sent in the unauthenticated
      state as well.  The MIH_MGMT_SAP defines primitives for MIES, MICS
      and MIIS.

   S 6.2.1: ... information provided by MIIS is less dynamic or static
      in nature and is comprised of parameters such as network
      operators, higher layer service information, etc.  MICS and MIIS
      Information could be used in combination by the terminal/network
      to facilitate the handover.

   S 6.3.1: Media Independent Information Service includes support for
      various Information Elements (IEs).  Information Elements provide
      information that is essential for a handover module to make
      intelligent handover decision.

   S 6.3.1: Depending on the type of mobility support for different
      types of information elements may be necessary for performing
      handovers.

   S 6.3.1: ... horizontal handovers across different PoAs of the same
      access network information available from lower link layers of
      access network may be sufficient.  In such cases information
      elements like intra-technology neighbor reports and other link
      layer information required during handovers is directly available
      from the access network.  In such cases the availability of higher
      layer services offered by the network typically does not change
      appreciably across different network point of attachments.

   S 6.3.1: ... vertical handovers the terminal may move across
      different access networks.  In such cases there is a need to
      select appropriate PoA in the new network based on both optimum
      link layer connectivity as well as availability of appropriate
      higher layer services to permit service and session continuity for
      active user applications

Internet-Draft        Some Requirements for an MIIS            June 2005


   S 6.3.1: Media Independent Information Service (MIIS) provides the
      capability for obtaining the necessary information for handovers.
      This includes information about lower layers such as neighbor maps
      and other link layer parameters as well as information about
      available higher layer services such as access to internet
      connectivity, availability of VPN services, etc.

   S 6.3.1: The set of different higher layer services provided by the
      MIIS may constantly evolve.  At the same time the list of access
      networks that are supported by MIIS may also evolve.  As such
      there is a need for flexibility and extensibility in the way the
      MIIS provides support for different information elements.  Towards
      this end the MIIS defines a schema.  The schema helps a client of
      MIIS to discover the capabilities of MIIS and also discover the
      entire set of different access networks and IEs supported by a
      particular implementation.

   S 6.3.1: Schema representation also allows the terminal to query the
      information in a more flexible and efficient manner.  As part of
      defining this schema the MIIS can also identify a set of basic
      information elements that can define the core functionality of
      different implementations of MIIS.  Other information elements as
      they are added can become part of the more extended set of MIIS
      capabilities.

   S 6.3.1: MIIS provides information about different access networks
      such as 802 networks, 3GPP networks and 3GPP2 networks.  The MIIS
      also allows this collective information to be accessed from any
      single network.  Thus for example using a 802.11 access network it
      may be possible to get information about not only all other 802
      networks in a particular region but also that of 3GPP and 3GPP2
      networks as well.

   S 6.3.2: Information Service Elements The information service
      elements can be classified into three groups:

      *  General Network Information (GNI): These information elements
         give a general overview of the network like network ID,
         location of different PoAs of the network, IP version, operator
         of the network, and so on.

      *  Link Layer Information (LLI): These information elements
         include the information related to link layer layers such as,
         link layer parameters (channel, frequency, PHY types), data
         rates, neighbor information, security, QoS, and so forth.

      *  Higher Layer Information (HLI): These information elements
         include higher layer services or applications that are

         supported by the respective network.  Some examples are support
         for Multimedia Message Service (MMS), Mobile IP (MIP), Virtual
         Private Network (VPN), types of applications supported (e.g.
         VoIP, e-mail, IPsec VPNs, streaming media, location based ),

      represent information about lower layers of network stack as well
      as about higher layer services available in different access
      networks.

   S 6.3.3: A schema is defined by a language and can be represented in
      multiple ways.  Examples include Resource Description Framework
      (RDF) which is based on XML, ASN.1 which is used in 802 MIBs,
      Variants or a simple TLV representation of different information
      elements.

   S 6.3.3: The MIIS schema is classified into two major categories:
      Basic schema that is essential for every MIH to support and
      Extended schema that is optional and can be vendor specific.

   S 7.4.14.1: MIH_Information.request

      This primitive is used by a station's MIH (or an application on
      behalf of MIH) to request information either from the network or
      from a remote MIH.  The information query can be related to a
      specific interface, attributes to the network interface as well as
      entire network capability.  In other words, the service primitive

      will have the flexibility to query either a specific data within a
      network interface or extended schema of a given network.  The
      network interface is not explicitly specified in the primitive,
      but is rather implicitly selected based on the specific MIH_MGMT
      SAP that is selected.

   S 7.4.14.1: Examples: 1.  If a client is interested in getting
      information about all the elements of a network, it sends the
      following request after getting associated to the network:

      MIH_Information.request (FILTER_INFO_ALL_ELEMENTS)

      Depending on the amount of information available, the response
      could be big data flow.

      2.  If a client is interested to know whether VPN is supported by
      the network of interest, he could send following request:

      MIH_Information.request (FILTER_INFO_VPN_SUPPORT)

      In this case the response could be quite simple, .Yes. or .No..

      3.  If a client is interested to know whether EAP support is
      enabled by a network, the request could be as follows:

      MIH_Information.request (FILTER_INFO_ELEMENT_SECURITY,EAP)

      In this case too the response could be quite simple: Yes or No

   S 9.4.2: Information Service based amendments

      Many media specific essential information elements have been
      identified.  These need to be supported in the access network
      specific standard.  Information elements specific to 802.11 access
      network need to be supported in the base specification as well.

   S 9.4.3.1.3: Extension of Network Control and Management System
      (NCMS)

      (802.16) NCMS is required to be extended to support MIH event
      services, command services, and information services.  When NCMS
      in terminal or BS interfaces with MIH Function layer, NCMS may
      provide means for MIH Function layer to interface with management
      plane in MS or BS.

   9.4.3.2.1: Overview of MIH Capability Delivery

      There are two ways for MS to obtain MIH Capability of IEEE 802.16
      BSs.  One is the method of Pre-acquisition before handover, and
      the other is the method of Post-acquisition after handover.
