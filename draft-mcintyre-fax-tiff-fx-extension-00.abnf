    The profiles that apply to this file; a profile is a subset of the
    full set of permitted fields and field values of TIFF for facsimile.
    This field is used when more than one profiles are used within the 
    file. This field SHALL only be present when the FaxProfile field has
    a value of 255 (X'FF').
    A value of 1 in a bit location indicates the corresponding
    profile is used. The currently defined bits are:
    Bit 0: minimal black & white lossless, Profile S
    Bit 1: extended black & white lossless, Profile F
    Bit 2: lossless JBIG black & white, Profile J
    Bit 3: lossy color and grayscale, Profile C
    Bit 4: lossless color and grayscale, Profile L
    Bit 5: Mixed Raster Content, Profile M
    Bit 6: lossy and lossless JBIG2 black & white, Profile T
    Bits 7-31: reserved for future use.

    WARNING: Files containing more that one profiles "SHOULD" contain
    the MultiProfiles field, identifying the profiles present. The
    number of profiles present within a file is ambiguous without the
    MultiProfiles or FaxProfile field. It is highly likely that
    readers of files without the MultiProfiles or FaxProfile will
    assume that only one profile is present, the profile that is
    consistent with the Compression type and other relevant values that
    are present within the first IFD. Such readers may experience
    difficulty if different Compression types and/or other relevant
    parameters are encountered in subsequent IFDs within the file.
