1.  Introduction

   BGP speaking devices have many default settings which need to be
   revisited as part of improving the routing ecosystem.  There is a
   need to provide guidace to BGP implementors for the default behaviors
   of a well functioning internet ecosystem.  Routing leaks [3] are part
   of the problem, but software defects and operator misconfigurations
   are just a few of the attacks on internet stability we aim to
   address.

   Usually BGP speaking devices accept all routes from a configured peer
   or neighbor.  This practice dates back to the early days of internet
   protocols in being very permissive in offering routing information to
   allow all networks to reach each other.  With the core of the
   internet becoming more densely interconnected the risk of a
   misbehaving edge device or BGP speaking customer poses signficiant
   risks to the reachability of critical services.

   This proposal intends to solve this situation with the requiring the
   explicity configuration of BGP policy for any non-iBGP speaking
   session such as customers, peers or confederation boundaries.  When
   this solution is implemented, devices will no longer pass routes
   without explicit policy.

2.  Definitions and Accronyms

   o  BGP: Border Gateway Protocol [2]

3.  Solution Requirements

   The following requirements apply to the solution described in this
   document:

   o  Software MUST NOT accept routes from an eBGP peer without an
      operator configuring a policy

   o  Software MUST NOT require a configuration directive to operate in
      this mode.

   o  Software MUST NOT send routes to an eBGP peer without an operator
      configuring a policy

   o  Software MUST provide protection from internal failures preventing
      the advertisement and acceptance of routes

   o  Software MAY provide a configuration option to disable this
      security capability.

4.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank the following people for their
   comments and support: [TBD].

5.  Security Considerations

   This document addresses the basic security posture of a BGP speaking
   device within a network.  Operators have a need for implementors to
   address the problem through a behavior change to mitigate against
   possible attacks from a permissive security posture.  Attacks and
   inadvertent advertisements cause business impact necessitating this
   default behavior.
