     1. Introduction 

        The concept of scalable adaptive multicast includes both scaling 
        properties and adaptability properties.  Scalability is intended to 
        cover: 
        o  large group size 

        o  large numbers of small groups 

        o  rate of group membership change 

        o  admission control for QoS 

        o  use with network layer QoS mechanisms

        o  varying degrees of reliability 

        o  trees connect nodes over global internet 

        Adaptability includes 
        o  use of different control mechanisms for different multicast trees 
           depending on initial application parameters or application class 

        o  changing multicast tree structure depending on changes in 
           application requirements, network conditions, and membership 

        o  use of different control mechanisms and tree structure in 
           different regions of network depending on native multicast 
           support, network characteristics, and node behavior 

        The following sections describe some adaptation scenarios.  After the 
        base scenarios are elaborated, then scenarios for scalability and 
        dynamic adaptation should be added. 

     2. Heterogeneous Multicast Infrastructure 

     2.1. Varying Infrastructure by Network Region 

        Regions A, B, C are disjoint areas of the network with some type of 
        native multicast support.  Region Z is all other areas of the network 
        with no native multicast support.  Region Z may be partitioned by A, 
        B, and/or C. 

        A multicast connection between nodes in A, B, C, and Z is needed. In 
        each region A, B, C, the respective native multicast mechanism is 
        used.   

        Multicast topology choices include: 

        o  Multicast applications see an end-to-end multicast application 
           layer which is mapped to a native layer transparently in the 
           regions that it is available. The overlay’s group management 
           mechansisms hold for all nodes, and are mapped transparently to 
           the native layer mechanisms in the appropriate regions.  All nodes 
           have addresses in the overlay. 

        o  Multicast applications see an end-to-end native multicast, where 
           nodes in region Z connect to native regions using tunnels. The 
           native group management mechanisms hold for all nodes.

        Homogeneous sub-case: regions A, B, C may use the same native 
        multicast protocol.   

     2.2. Regional Transitions 

        A node in a new region D joins the multicast tree.  Region D has 
        native support. 

        What is the minimum number of nodes in a region needed for native 
        support to be used in that part of the tree? 

     3. Quality of Service 

     3.1. Native QOS, No Native Multicast 

        Each endpoint in the multicast tree specifies QOS constraints such as 
        bandwidth, delay, and jitter for a given source.  Multicast join 
        includes admission control step for the selected QOS mechanism. This 
        means that the join decision combines both multicast tree 
        considerations (eg., best metrics) and an admission control decision.  
        Paths to different endpoints from a given source might have different 
        QOS constraints.  A given multicast tree may mix QOS delivery and 
        best effort delivery to different receivers. 

        Available IP QOS mechanisms include Intserv, Diffserv, and MPLS. 
        Assume all regions of network have interoperable native QOS 
        mechanism.  Assume all receivers have homogenous capabilities. 

        The topology of the overlay is not assumed to be isomorphic to 
        available QOS paths.  The overlay must be sophisticated enough to 
        determine what paths are available and arrange its tree construction 
        and routing behaviour accordingly. 

        In order to enforce QOS, a measurement mechanism is needed. The 
        scalability of the measurement, feedback and policing mechanism is an 
        important issue.  RTP is such a measurement and feedback protocol for 
        UDP. 

        A source might adapt its bit rate and quality depending on feedback 
        from receivers.  There might be graceful degradation mechanisms such 
        as multi-description coding over different multicast paths.  This 
        behavior is application dependent.

     3.2. Other Combinations 

        Heterogeneous QOS refers to either 1) portions of the network where 
        no QOS mechanism exists at native level, or 2) receivers which have 
        heterogeneous capabilities.   

        These combinations need further elaboration. 

        o  Native QOS with Regional Native Multicast 

        o  Heterogeneous QOS, No Native Multicast 

        o  Heterogeneous QOS, Regional Native Multicast 

     4. Mobility 

        A mobile node’s home IP address is associated with its overlay 
        address (if this is an overlay) or group multicast address.   As the 
        node moves to another network, multicast messages are routed to it 
        via the home agent.  In addition to increased latency, node mobility 
        can impact robustness of multicast delivery due to loss of 
        connectivity during mobility transitions. Some link layer solutions 
        may mitigate or eliminate connectivity loss, but may require sending 
        packets to both old and new care-of addresses during the transition. 

        If the node uses its care-of address in the overlay or multicast 
        tree, then any mobility transition will be disruptive, causing  a 
        leave-join sequence.  

        Forwarding of packets can be through the home agent.  If the source 
        address is the care-of address, these might be rejected by nodes 
        expecting packets only from overlay-registered addresses. 

        In general, mobile node transitions to another network lead to lost 
        packets during the transition, and downstream nodes in the tree will 
        also be disconnected.  Possibile solutions are bi-casting the packets 
        to both old and new mobile addresses, or buffering packets at the 
        home agent. 

        If the overlay is aware that the node is mobile, then it could 
        construct a mesh rather than tree to connect to.  The mesh might 
        provide redundant paths to the mobile node’s children in the tree.  

        There can be different scenarios depending on whether all nodes in 
        multicast tree are mobile or a subset of nodes.

     5. Security Considerations 

        [RESC2006] surveys the security issues specific to overlay networks   
        which include: 

        o  Correctness of routing due to malicious nodes acting individually 
           or collectively 

        o  Node impersonation due to lack of secure routing and identity 

        o  Fairness enforcement since each node acts autonomously, it can 
           chose to limit its resource contribution to the operation of the 
           overlay 

        o  Denial of service (DOS) 

        o  Using overlays for launching DDoS attacks [ROSS2006] 

        SAM will not solve the overlay security problems, but should work 
        with overlays that provide security mechanisms. 

     6. Conclusions 

        Using this discussion with the separately developed SAM Design Space, 
        we will be able to enumerate those ares of the problem space for 
        which solutions exist and those which are open problems.  This will 
        suggest the steps by which the SAM Framework is designed.
