1. Introduction 

   [G.694.1] defines the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) 
   frequency grids for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) 
   applications. A frequency grid is a reference set of frequencies 
   used to denote allowed nominal central frequencies that may be used 
 
 
Zhang et al               Expires May 2016                    [Page 2] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-flexible-grid-rsvp-te-ext-05.txt         November 2015 
    

   for defining applications that utilize WDM transmission. The channel 
   spacing is the frequency spacing between two allowed nominal central 
   frequencies. All of the wavelengths on a fiber use different central 
   frequencies and occupy a designated range of frequency.  

   Fixed grid channel spacing is selected from 12.5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50 GHz, 
   100 GHz and integer multiples of 100 GHz. But [G.694.1] also defines 
   "flexible grids", known as "flexi-grid". The terms "frequency slot" 
   (i.e., the frequency range allocated to a specific channel and 
   unavailable to other channels within a flexible grid) and "slot 
   width" (i.e., the full width of a frequency slot in a flexible grid) 
   are introduced in [G.694.1] to define a flexible grid.  

   [FLEX-FWK] defines a framework and the associated control plane 
   requirements for the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching 
   (GMPLS) [RFC3945] based control of flexi-grid DWDM networks. 

   [RFC6163] provides a framework for GMPLS and Path Computation 
   Element (PCE) control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks 
   (WSONs), and [WSON-SIG] describes the requirements and protocol 
   extensions for signaling to set up Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in 
   WSONs.  

   This document describes the additional requirements and protocol 
   extensions to Resource reSerVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering 
   (RSVP-TE) [RFC3473] to set up LSPs in networks that support the 
   flexi-grid.  

2. Terminology  

   For terminology related to flexi-grid, please refer to [FLEX-FWK] 
   and [G.694.1]. 

2.1. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Requirements for Flexible Grid Signaling   

   The architecture for establishing LSPs in a flexi-grid network is 
   described in [FLEX-FWK].  

   An optical spectrum LSP occupies a specific frequency slot, i.e., a 
   range of frequencies. The process of computing a route and the 
   allocation of a frequency slot is referred to as Routing and 
 
 
Zhang et al               Expires May 2016                    [Page 3] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-flexible-grid-rsvp-te-ext-05.txt         November 2015 
    

   Spectrum Assignment (RSA). [FLEX-FWK] describes three architectural 
   approaches to RSA: combined RSA, separated RSA, and distributed SA. 
   The first two approaches are referred to as "centralized SA" because 
   both routing and spectrum (frequency slot) assignment are performed 
   by a centralized entity before the signaling procedure.  

   In the case of centralized SA, the assigned frequency slot is 
   specified in the RSVP-TE Path message during LSP setup. In the case 
   of distributed SA, the slot width of the flexi-grid LSP is specified 
   in the Path message, allowing the network elements to select the 
   frequency slot to be used when they process the RSVP-TE messages.  

   If the capability to switch or convert the whole optical spectrum 
   allocated to an optical spectrum LSP is not available at some nodes 
   along the path of the LSP, the LSP is subject to the Optical 
   "Spectrum Continuity Constraint" as described in [FLEX-FWK].  

   The remainder of this section states the additional requirements for 
   signaling in a flexi-grid network. 

3.1. Slot Width  

   The slot width is an end-to-end parameter representing how much 
   frequency resource is requested for a flexi-grid LSP. It is the 
   equivalent of optical bandwidth, although the amount of bandwidth 
   associated with a slot width will depend on the signal encoding. 

   Different LSPs may request different amounts of frequency resource 
   in flexible grid networks, so the slot width MUST be carried in the 
   signaling message during LSP establishment. This enables the nodes 
   along the LSP to know how much frequency resource has been requested 
   (in a Path message) and has been allocated (by a Resv message) for 
   the LSP.  

3.2. Frequency Slot  

   The frequency slot information identifies which part of the 
   frequency spectrum is allocated on each link for an LSP in a flexi-
   grid network.  

   This information MUST be present in a Resv message to indicate, hop-
   by-hop, the central frequency of the allocated resource. In 
   combination with the slot width indicated in a Resv message (see 
   Section 3.1) the central frequency carried in a Resv message 
   identifies the resources reserved for the LSP (known as the 
   frequency slot).  

 
 
Zhang et al               Expires May 2016                    [Page 4] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-flexible-grid-rsvp-te-ext-05.txt         November 2015 
    

   The frequency slot can be represented by the two parameters as 
   follows:  

      Frequency slot = [(central frequency) - (slot width)/2] ~  
                       [(central frequency) + (slot width)/2]  

   As is common with other resource identifiers (i.e., labels) in GMPLS 
   signaling, it must be possible for the head-end node when sending a 
   Path message to suggest or require the central frequency to be used 
   for the LSP. Furthermore, for bidirectional LSPs, the Path message 
   MUST be able to specify the central frequency to be used for reverse 
   direction traffic.  

   As described in [G.694.1], the allowed frequency slots for the 
   flexible DWDM grid have a nominal central frequency (in THz) defined 
   by: 

   193.1 + n * 0.00625 

   where n is zero or a positive or negative integer. 

   The slot width (in GHz) is defined as: 

   12.5 * m 

   where m is a positive integer. 

   It is possible that an implementation supports only a subset of the 
   possible slot widths and central frequencies. For example, an 
   implementation could be built where the nominal central frequency 
   granularity is 12.5 GHz (by only allowing values of n that are even) 
   and that only supports slot widths as a multiple of 25 GHz (by only 
   allowing values of m that are even).  

   Further details can be found in [FLEX-FWK].  

4. Protocol Extensions  

   This section defines the extensions to RSVP-TE signaling for GMPLS 
   [RFC3473] to support flexible grid networks.  

4.1. Traffic Parameters  

   In RSVP-TE, the SENDER_TSPEC object in the Path message indicates 
   the requested resource reservation. The FLOWSPEC object in the Resv 
   message indicates the actual resource reservation. 

 
 
Zhang et al               Expires May 2016                    [Page 5] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-flexible-grid-rsvp-te-ext-05.txt         November 2015 
    

   As described in Section 3.1, the slot width represents how much 
   frequency resource is requested for a flexi-grid LSP. That is, it 
   describes the end-to-end traffic profile of the LSP. Therefore, the 
   traffic parameters for a flexi-grid LSP encode the slot width.  

   This document defines new C-Types for the SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC 
   objects to carry Spectrum Switched Optical Network (SSON) traffic 
   parameters: 

   SSON SENDER_TSPEC: Class = 12, C-Type = TBD1.  

   SSON FLOWSPEC: Class = 9, C-Type = TBD2.  

   The SSON traffic parameters carried in both objects MUST have the 
   same format as shown in Figure 1.  

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |              m                |            Reserved           | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
                   Figure 1: The SSON Traffic Parameters 
                                      
   m (16 bits): a positive integer and the slot width is specified by 
   m*12.5 GHz.  

   The Reserved bits MUST be set to zero and ignored upon receipt. 

4.1.1. Applicability to Fixed Grid Networks 

   Note that the slot width (i.e., traffic parameters) of a fixed grid 
   defined in [G.694.1] can also be specified by using the SSON traffic 
   parameters. The fixed grid channel spacings (12.5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50 
   GHz, 100 GHz and integer multiples of 100 GHz) are also the 
   multiples of 12.5 GHz, so the m parameter can be used to represent 
   these slot widths.  

   Therefore, it is possible to consider using the new traffic 
   parameter object types in common signaling messages for flexi-grid 
   and legacy DWDM networks.  

4.2. Generalized Label  

   In the case of a flexible grid network, the labels that have been 
   requested or allocated as signaled in the RSVP-TE objects are 

 
 
Zhang et al               Expires May 2016                    [Page 6] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-flexible-grid-rsvp-te-ext-05.txt         November 2015 
    

   encoded as described in [FLEX-LBL]. This new label encoding can 
   appear in any RSVP-TE object or sub-object that can carry a label.  

   As noted in Section 4.2 of [FLEX-LBL], the m parameter forms part of 
   the label as well as part of the traffic parameters.  

   As described in Section 4.3 of [FLEX-LBL], a "compound label", 
   constructed from a concatenation of the flexi-grid LABELs, is used 
   when signaling an LSP that uses multiple flexi-grid slots.  

4.3. Signaling Procedures  

   There are no differences between the signaling procedure described 
   for LSP control in [FLEX-FWK] and those required for use in a fixed-
   grid network [WSON-SIG]. Obviously, the TSpec, FlowSpec, and label 
   formats described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 are used. The signaling 
   procedures for distributed SA and centralized SA can be applied.  

5. IANA Considerations 

5.1. RSVP Objects Class Types 

   This document introduces two new Class Types for existing RSVP 
   objects. IANA is requested to make allocations from the "Resource 
   ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters" registry using the "Class 
   Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types" sub-registry. 

       Class Number  Class Name                            Reference 
       ------------  -----------------------               ---------

                     Class Type (C-Type):

       Class Number  Class Name                            Reference

                     Class Type (C-Type):

   IANA is requested to assign the same value for TBD1 and TBD2, and a 
   value of 8 is suggested.  
    
6. Manageability Considerations  

   This document makes minor modifications to GMPLS signaling, but does 
   not change the manageability considerations for such networks.  
   Clearly, protocol analysis tools and other diagnostic aids 
   (including logging systems and MIB modules) will need to be enhanced 
   to support the new traffic parameters and label formats. 
    
7. Implementation Status 

   [RFC Editor Note: Please remove this entire seciton prior to 
   publication as an RFC.] 

   This section records the status of known implementations of the 
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of 
   this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 
   6982 [RFC6982].  The description of implementations in this section 
   is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in 
   progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any 
   individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the 
   IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the 
   information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  
   This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog 
   of available implementations or their features.  Readers are advised 
   to note that other implementations may exist. 

   According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups 
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of 
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable 
   experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented 
   protocols more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups to 
   use this information as they see fit."
