<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The proposed <a class='info' href='#I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header'>[I&#8209;D.kucherawy&#8209;sender&#8209;auth&#8209;header]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kucherawy, M., &ldquo;Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> defines a header field used
        to capture email verification results of border receptions. These results are then conveyed
        to Mail User Agents (MUA) and downstream filters. This header field is to augment filtering
        decisions and message annotations that can be made visible to recipients. The annotations
        could affirm originating domains or content integrity when based upon Domainkeys or DKIM
        results, or a domain's authorization of a publicly transmitting SMTP client IP address when
        based upon Sender-ID or SPF results, or that the SMTP client IP address maps to a matching
        domain within the DNS reverse namespace.
</p>
<p>Although the draft acknowledges the conflation of authorization with authentication in
        section 1.5.2, and explicitly declares Sender-ID and SPF as the authorization of the
        transmitting SMTP client, it still fails to offer the authenticated entity being trusted in
        the exchange, the IP address of the SMTP client. An authenticated entity is essential for
        reputation assessments which section 4.1 indicates should be made prior to results being
        revealed. A reputation check is often a necessary step to mitigate abuse and fraud. Even so,
        the header offers no assurance that any reputation check has been made, nor does it ensure
        that the trusted entity, the IP address of the SMTP client, can be determined by the MUA or
        downstream filter.

Introduction</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header'>[I&#8209;D.kucherawy&#8209;sender&#8209;auth&#8209;header]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kucherawy, M., &ldquo;Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> introduces a header field, which because
        of its label, might potentially mislead recipients into believing that it contains
        "Authentication-Results". Common phrases such as "Authentication-Results", "pass", "fail",
        and "senderid" rather than the use of result codes belies the draft's introductory claim
        that this header is not intended for direct human consumption. MUAs, such as Apple Mail, are
        able to directly display this header above a message following minor user accessible setting
        changes. In the case of Sender-ID or SPF, the deceptive nature of this header can be greatly
        remedied by including the "authenticated" IP address of the SMTP client, in addition to the
        authorizing domain. This IP address must be passed to the SPF record verification process by
        the receiving MTA, and is essential for either Sender-ID and SPF processing. Only an
        authenticated identity is able to serve as a safe basis for reputation. After all, a
        reputation check of the authenticated source is strongly recommended by section 4.1.
</p>
<p>The scope of the Authentication-Results header per section 1.3 states:</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>This proposal is to address the needs of authenticating messages or properties of
            messages during their actual transport.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>However, the scope of the SPF record, such as whether the Mail From or the PRA are the
        intended authorization identifiers, or whether these identifiers are exclusively controlled
        by the authorizing domain, remains unknown. Although the specification for the SPF version 1
        record conflicts with that of Sender-ID regarding which identity can offer authorization,
        whether a version 2 record was used is not tracked by Sender-ID. This means the results
        returned by Sender-ID leave the intent of Mail From or the PRA use unknown.
</p>
<p>In addition, although access to outbound SMTP servers may be limited, restrictions may not
        have been imposed upon the use of the Mail From or the PRA. A strategy to control abuse
        might rely upon rate limits and access denial subsequent to reports of abuse. The reasons
        for publishing SPF records could have been to mitigate backscatter, where loss of some
        Non-Delivery-Notifications (NDNs) was considered acceptable. The intent may not have been to
        offer a positive basis for identification, but instead their expectations may have been that
        negative results would limit the number of invalid NDNs. Evidence of this intent might be
        denoted by SPF records ending with "?all", for example.
</p>
<p>With hundreds of millions of compromised systems organized into bot-nets, no assumption
        regarding unauthenticated identifiers should ever be considered safe. For example, assume a
        domain, using a version 1 SPF record, authorized a provider to handle outbound email with an
        understanding that their Mail From is to be bound to authenticated accounts controlled by
        only their domain. Even so, controlling the Mail From will not prevent another inbound
        provider from assuming a PRA found in a message has also been bound exclusively to accounts
        controlled by the domain, even when there is little justification to assume that this
        arrangement exists. Although the experimental SPF specification warns against making this
        assumption, the experimental Sender-ID specification permits the application of version 1
        records against the PRA.
</p>
<p>The places within the <a class='info' href='#I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header'>[I&#8209;D.kucherawy&#8209;sender&#8209;auth&#8209;header]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kucherawy, M., &ldquo;Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> that purport either
        Sender-ID or SPF as authenticating the originating domain overlook the dangerous and
        misleading assumptions needed to arrive at that conclusion. Just as it would not be safe
        give someone a negative credit rating based upon transactions not substantiated through some
        form of authentication, a domain must not be held accountable for incorrect assumptions made
        by receiving MTAs. Doing so would be highly disruptive, coercive, and unfair.
</p>
<p>While there are cases where a domain is controlled by a bad actor, often use of the bad
        domain is brief. Difficulties imposed by Sender-ID or SPF in determining whether a domain
        originated a fraudulent or abusive message imposes delays in the assignment of negative
        reputations. Any delay is likely to make protections far less effective than when using the
        already authenticated IP address of the SMTP client.
</p>
<p>Negative reputations based upon the IP address of the SMTP client are fairly common, and
        many are automated and assigned nearly immediately. Since security is fragile, whenever a
        server suffers from a security breach, rather than blocking all mail from a domain to
        mitigate fraudulent messages, assigning a negative rating to affected SMTP client IP
        addresses mitigates the problem without completely blocking all messages from the domain.
        The domain would then be free to issue warning messages regarding the nature of the security
        breach. Such notification would not be possible if only the reputation of the authorizing
        domain was expected to serve as a mitigation solution.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Why hide the IP address of the SMTP client?</h3>

<p>It has been claimed by the author that including the IP address of the SMTP client is out
        of scope. However, one might just as easily argue that only authenticated identities should
        be considered within scope of an "Authentication-Results" header. Although the past four
        years has seen a barrage of marketing efforts that repeatedly and erroneously describe
        Sender-ID as authenticating the originating domain of a message, this would be making an
        assumption that fully trusts the SMTP client to have bound the use of either the Mail From
        or the PRA to accounts exclusively controlled by the authorizing domain. There will be cases
        where imposing this binding is not practical, nor kept in compliance with the standard
        specifications. Any stipulation of authentication would therefore exclude the listing of
        authorizing domains, in favor of the IP address of the SMTP client. A fair compromise would
        be to include both.
</p>
<p>Influential proponents of Sender-ID and SPF include large providers, whose clout is
        increased by having their mail-stream represented by a single identifier, their domain.
        Having acceptance or annotations based solely upon the authorizing domain, rather than also
        including an IP addresses they control, is understandable, but is fairly short-sighted. Only
        relying upon the authorizing domain makes dealing with security more difficult, and places
        customers at much greater risk. Providing an allusion of security greatly benefits
        confidence artists who will have no trouble exploiting the difference between authorization
        and authentication.

IPv6, SPF macros, and local-parts</h3>

<p>When IPv6 becomes more commonly used, white-listing IP addresses will likely be needed as a
        solution for dealing with the increased address range. There are currently no practical
        solutions able to scale to the challenging range of IP addresses that might be controlled by
        bad actors.
</p>
<p>Unlike most DNS resources that segregate IPv4 and IPv6 datasets, SPF consolidates both IPv4
        and IPv6 addresses into a common list comprised of a chain of DNS transactions. SPF also
        includes macros used by recipients that can expand the IP address of the SMTP client into
        labels used in subsequent DNS queries. Expressing an IPv6 address using the SPF macro in the
        reverse order nibble form can comprise a query containing more than 32 labels. If the
        local-part macros are used to locate MX records, the MX targets can comprise a set of 100
        separate hostnames. Local-part macros could also be used to chain SPF record sets.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Authentication-Header draft may actually encourage use of this dangerous
        local-part macro. Section 2.4.3 requires local-part authentication before it is to be
        included within the Authentication-Results header. In addition, there is nothing to indicate
        whether the local-part played a role in obtaining SPF results. The danger imposed by the use
        of the local-part macro is inherent in the query required to support both an IPv6 expansion,
        in conjunction with the expansion of local-part macros induced by possibly cached SPF
        records. The local-part, along with a range of IP addresses made readily possible by IPv6,
        can be manipulated to induce a flurry of large DNS transactions directed toward any
        otherwise uninvolved domain, all directed by cached DNS records.
</p>
<p>The SPF local-part macro would allow a cached DNS record to be repeatedly exploited by a
        spam campaign without the attacker consuming any of their additional resources beyond that
        used to send their spam campaign. It is never a good idea to allow free attacks. The
        previous draft regarding this concern was never fully understood, nor was the basis of the
        concern acknowledged by SPF proponents.
</p>
<p>Logically, local-part macros would not safely provide a positive result without the query
        also being combined with the IP address list of the SMTP clients in some form. The list
        structure would need to be repeated for each of the users. Rcpt To provides a simpler, lower
        overhead, and more expedient way to determine whether a NDN should be returned without the
        risk associated with active content placed within DNS resource records. Several parsers
        ignore local-part macro expansion since they rarely play any role in providing positive
        results.

Recommended Modifications</h3>

<p>Change Section 2.4.3 FROM:
</p>
<p>If the retrieved sender policies used to evaluate [SPF] and [SENDERID] do not contain
        explicit provisions for authenticating the local-part (see section 3.4.1 of [MAIL]) of an
        address, the "pvalue" reported along with results for these mechanisms SHOULD NOT include
        the local-part. 
</p>
<p>TO:
</p>
<p>To discourage exploitation risks created by a seldom used local-part authentication feature
        provided by SPF, and to lessen the misleading appearance that only providing the domain
        represents, the entity that has been authenticated, the IP address of the SMTP client,
        should be included. The "pvalue" reported along with results for these mechanisms SHOULD NOT
        include the local-part, but instead the local-part SHOULD BE replaced with the IP address
        used to evaluate the SPF record after being converted to a string using conventional dotted
        quad notation for IPv4, or the 16 bit hexadecimal notation defined by <a class='info' href='#RFC3513'>[RFC3513]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hinden, R. and S. Deering, &ldquo;Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>, section 2.2, and terminated by the "@" symbol.
</p>
<p>Change Section 4 FROM:
</p>
<p>End users making direct use of this header field may inadvertently trust information that
        has not been properly vetted. If, for example, a basic [SPF] result were to be relayed which
        claims an authenticated addr-spec, the local-part of that addr-spec has actually not been
        authenticated. Thus, an MTA adding this header field SHOULD NOT include any data which has
        not been authenticated by the method(s) being applied. Moreover, MUAs SHOULD NOT render to
        users such information if it is presented by a method known not to authenticate it.
</p>
<p>TO:
</p>
<p>End users making direct use of this header field may inadvertently trust information that
        has not been properly vetted. [SPF] results SHOULD BE handled as specified by section 3.4.3.
        In general, an MTA adding this header field SHOULD NOT include any data which has not been
        authenticated by the method(s) being applied. Moreover, MUAs SHOULD NOT render to users such
        information if it is presented by a method known not to authenticate it. An exception is to
        be made for an Authorizing domain only when it accompanies the authenticated IP address of
        the SMTP client.
