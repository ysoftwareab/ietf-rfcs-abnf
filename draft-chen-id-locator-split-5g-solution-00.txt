1  Introduction

   With the emergence of various new communication services, there have
   been many new network communication needs, and also more and more new
   demands for network capability. For example, there are high mobility
   requirements, such as high-speed railway communications; low latency
   and high reliability, such as for industrial Internet production
   control process; low power consumption and low complexity of small
   data reported such as the mass of the sensor device access network.
   Another example, AR/VR communication needs end-to-end delay
   requirement of less than 20ms, excluding terminal and network side of
   the business processing delay, the network transmission delay
   requirements of less than 10ms , it needs to maintain business
   continuity while maintaining low latency as the AR / VR end-user
   moves.

   In the field of wireless communication network, 5G wireless system
   researches also proposed to the mobile network a list of new design
   requirements in order to meet the needs of future communication, such
   as flexible mobility management solutions, multi-access, efficient
   use of network resources, efficient data transmission, ultra-low
   latency transmission, a large number of equipment access and so on.

   The overall look at mass terminal access, ubiquitous mobility, low
   latency, high bandwidth, high reliability, low power consumption and
   low complexity, is to meet the basic characteristics of the new
   business network and requirements. Currently the IP address indicates
   both the identity and location of the end host. It doesn't support
   mobility and multiple accesses naturally. It is also inefficient in
   terms of route validity (referring to route aggregation with
   Locator), scalability, and security. 

   If the communication address and Identifier are separated, the
   connection can be established with any identifier, not limited by the
   communication address segment of the IP network. At the same time,
   the communication message is transmitted by any address, and is not
   affected the identifier of both ends of the communication. In this
   memo, a generic network scheme based on ID / Locator separation
   architecture is proposed to satisfy the following requirements of
   future networks:

   (1) Ubiquitous mobility: the identifier is independent from network
   location and can cope with the change of network location.

   (2) Low latency: select any optimal communication path, not subject
   to IP network segment restrictions, especially for the mobile
   communication.

   (3) High reliability: one communication identifier could be mapped to
   multi-address, multi transmission path, which can be back up each
   other.

   (4) High-bandwidth: multi-address, make full use of a variety of
   access technologies; multi-path, take full advantage of network
   bandwidth.

   (5) Low-power and low complexity network, mass IOT device access and
   small data packet message transmission: transmission mechanism is
   simple, based on arbitrary identification of data transmission;
   simple signaling, transmission redundancy, to avoid heavy protocol
   stack and complex IP address allocation mechanism.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Current Solution Analysis

   This chapter makes a preliminary analysis of some existing mobility
   management protocols and protocols based on ID-Locator separation
   scheme.

2.1  GTP

   GTP [TS29.060] is a 3GPP-defined tunneling protocol that provides
   mobility support in 3GPP network. GTP is an access-related L2
   mobility management protocol; it supports mobility of 3GPP access
   technologies. But for non-3GPP access technology, such as WiFi
   access, through a special access adapter to access 4G EPC network. At
   the same time GTP is a local mobility protocol, and it does not
   support the user to switch the anchor after moving.

2.2  MIPv4/MIPv6

   MIPv4 [RFC5944]  and MIPv6 [RFC6275] are the Host Based mobility
   management protocol. RFC4830 analysis of the support of the routing
   optimization Host-based mobility management protocol several major
   issues: (1) User privacy disclosure: in case of routing optimization,
   the correspondent node can see the local IP changes, and it can track
   the location of the user; (2) Switching performance: end to end,
   long-distance communication, the location of the change of
   information to inform the end of a greater delay; (3) Low efficiency
   of air interface: IP over IP transmission format, the head in the

INTERNET DRAFT              <Document Title>            October 31, 2016


   empty packet transmission load, transmission inefficient; (4)
   Backward compatibility issue, need to modify the terminal to support
   MIP protocol stack.

2.3  PMIPv6

   PMIPv6 [RFC5213] migrates MIPv6 mobility management capabilities to
   the edge of the network, through the network proxy. PMIP is a local
   scope mobility management protocol, and it does not support the user
   to move the anchor after the switch.

2.4  HIP

   The HIP [RFC7401] protocol is a protocol that conforms to the idea of
   ID Locator separation. It can support Host-based mobility and is more
   secure than MIP. It has the same problem as MIP.

2.5  LISP

   The main purpose of LISP [RFC6830] protocol design is to support the
   scalability of IP network routing, and to collect the IP packets with
   the same route through Locator to reduce the number of routes of
   network devices and to support traffic engineering. LISP protocol
   does not support network-side mobility; LISP extension protocol can
   support Host-based mobility, and MIP, HIP with the same host mobility
   issues;

2.6  ILNP

   ILNP [RFC6740] protocol divide 128-bit long IPv6 address into two
   parts, high 64-bit locator, and low 64-bit ID, this format can reduce
   the header overload; the control plane is designed mainly through
   enhancement of DNS protocol and ICMP protocol. ILNP protocol mainly
   supports Host Based mobility; and through the DNS system to track the
   user mobile location, it can not support high-speed mobile and
   service continuity.

3 Design Principle

   The ID Locator separation scheme in this document is designed to
   adhere to the following design principles:

   1. Providing high-performance, flexible, ubiquitous mobility support

   2. Support IoT transmission characteristics, for example, large
   connections, sleep, different levels of mobility.

   3. Support multi-access

   4. Delay performance requirements

   5. Has good scalability

   6. Minimize modifications to existing terminals. Supports legacy
   terminals.

   7. Compatible with existing IP networks.

   8. Support any form of ID forwarding, not only limit to the IP
   address compatible format.

   9. Support multiple forwarding plane format, which can be selected
   flexible, such as LISP format or ILA format.

   10. Access agnostic: the L3 network mobility is supported mainly, and
   can be compatible with a variety of L2 mobility technology.

   11. Support the network based mobility, can be deployed in the
   terminal to support the host based mobility flexible. 

4  Architecture Design

4.1  Architecture Overview

   Based on the idea of ID-Locator separation, combining the above new
   design requirements, the following scheme architecture is proposed.
   The architecture contains the ID domain, that is, using the ID-
   Locator separation to communicate, also includes the IP domain, that
   is, the existing IP address-based communication.

   (1) ID host registers ID and ID location information.

   (2) The UCP allocates a designated IP address to each registered ID
   host as a proxy IP for interworking with the external IP network; and
   registers the relation between the ID and the IP in the DNS system;

   (3) Communication from IP-based host to ID-based host.

   (3.1) The UCP instructs the LPF to establish a mapping table between
   the ID and the IP, which acts as the proxy point for interworking
   with the IP network.

   (3.2) When an IP entity needs to communicate with an ID host, it
   first resolves the proxy IP from the DNS system and then communicates

   with the ID host through the standard IP packet.

   (3.3) The LPF receives the IP packet, finds the mapping relationship,
   de-encapsulates the packet, and re-encapsulates the ID packet header,
   and sends the packet to the destination ID host;

   (4) Communication from ID host to IP host.

   (4.1) ID host resolves the domain name of the remote end, and DNS
   returns the IP address of the remote end. 

   (4.2) If the peer ID is a standard IP address, it must be explicitly
   marked in the encapsulated packet so that the LPF can determine the
   difference.

   (4.3) When the LPF receives a packet and determines that the peer end
   is an IP address, the LPF de-encapsulates ID packet. Packets are
   encapsulated with proxy IPs on the LPF and then sent to the remote
   end in the IP domain.

   (4.4) If the ID host does not support DNS resolution, the LPF could
   finish the DNS procedure instead of ID host.
