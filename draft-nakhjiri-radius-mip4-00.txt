  1.  Introduction 
    
   Mobile IP provides routing services to the nodes that need to change 
   their IP address due to mobility [MIPv4]. To help setting up such 
   routing services, the mobile node (MN) needs to engage in an 
   authenticated registration message exchange with the Mobile IP 
   agents. Message authentication is performed by inclusion of specific 
   authentication extensions to the mobility registration messages and 
   relies on existence of trust relationships between the mobile node 
   and its mobility agents. These trust relationships include, among 
   other things, keys that are shared between the mobile node and these 
   agents.

   Many times such trust does not exist in advance and hence there is a 
   need for dynamic key management methods in conjunction with Mobile IP 
   signaling.  
    
   Mobile IPv4 working group is currently working on extensions for the 
   registration process to allow the MN and mobility agents to request 
   assistance from the AAA server in authentication [MIP4CHAL] and 
   creation of the key material, all based on the pre-established trust 
   relationship between the MN and its home AAA server. 
    
   However, on the AAA side, currently only Diameter provides 
   specification for interaction with Mobile IP agents [DIAMIP]. The 
   available RADIUS support for Mobile IP is mostly vendor proprietary 
   and lacks support for interoperability between vendors. The goal of 
   this document is to provide a specification for IETF RADIUS 
   attributes supporting Mobile IPv4. 
    
  2.  Terminology and Assumptions 
    
   The scope of this draft is to introduce RADIUS functionality and 
   attributes, designed to support Mobile IP registration for roaming 
   within or beyond the administrative domain of the mobile node. The 
   design in this document also serves inter-domain scenarios in which 
   both a foreign AAA server (AAAF) and the home AAA server (AAAH) are 
   involved. However, to keep the scenario discussions simple we treat 
   the entire AAA infrastructure as consisting of a AAAF and a AAAH, but 
   note that in the multi-domain scenario, the operation may involve a 
   number of AAA proxies (AAA nodes operating between AAAF and AAAH) to 
   provide Mobile IP-RADIUS interaction for a roaming mobile node. 
    
   A critical assumption in this draft is that the MN shares a key, 
   called MN-AAA key with its home RADIUS server (AAAH). 
    
   MN-AAA key 
     The MN-AAA key is the basis for the creation of all the keys that 
     are created dynamically between MN and its mobility agents.  
    
   Mobility Security Association (MSA) 
     The security associations that are created as a result of Mobile 
     IP-AAA signaling are called mobility security association 
     (MSA)[MIPKEYS]. 
    
   Home agent (HA) 
     A Mobile IP home agent that is responsible for generating and 
     keeping a binding between mobile nodeÆs permanent home address and 
     its care of address. 
    
   Foreign Agent (FA)

     A Mobile IP Foreign agent that is responsible for serving the 
     mobile node in foreign networks. 
      
   Home AAA server (AAAH) 
     The AAAH is a RADIUS server that operates in the home network.  
     The home network is the network that holds the user record. 
      
   Foreign AAA server (AAAF) 
     The AAAF is a RADIUS server that acts as a "forwarding server", 
     forwarding RADIUS packets to the AAAH. The AAAF resides in the 
     same domain that hosts the FA in the foreign network or hosts the 
     HA when the HA is not in the home network. Other Broker AAA ôproxy 
     serversö may exist between the AAAF and the AAAH.  The role of 
     these "proxy servers" is not germane to this document and will not 
     be mentioned hence forth. 
      
     In this document the terms AAAF and AAAH refer to RADIUS servers. 
      
    
  3.  Protocol Overview 
    
   In this section we will provide an overview of how a Mobile IP agent 
   and a RADIUS server can interact during a mobile node registration 
   process, to perform registration, authentication and key 
   distribution. There may be cases, where more than one type of mobile 
   IP agent is involved in Mobile IPv4 signaling, since Mobile IPv4 
   allows two types of care of addresses (CoA) for the mobile nodes: 
    
   1) When the MN acquires a collocated CoA (CcoA), it registers 
   directly with the HA without the interaction of any Mobile IP foreign 
   agents.  
   2) When the MN acquires a CoA from a Mobile IP foreign agent (FA) on 
   the foreign network, the MN must register through the FA and use the 
   FA based CoA for communications. The FA forwards the registration to 
   the HA for processing. 
    
  3.1  Co-located mobile nodes 
    
   In the case where the MN acquires a co-located CoA (CCoA), the MN 
   registers its CCoA with the HA directly. When the MN has a mobility 
   security association (MSA) with the HA, the MN can authenticate its 
   registration to the HA directly. However, when this MSA does not 
   exist, the HA must outsource the authentication to the AAA 
   infrastructure. However, this outsourcing is only possible when the 
   MN has a pre-established security association with the AAA 
   infrastructure (MN-AAA key).  
     
   The HA may reside in the mobile nodeÆs home domain, in which case HA 
   can reach the AAAH directly or the HA may reside in a foreign domain,

   which means the HA must reach the AAAH via the AAA infrastructure. In 
   the following picture we do not show the AAA infrastructure (AAAF) 
   that routes this messaging to the AAAH, since it does not impact the 
   discussion in this draft. The Mobile IP HA in this model acts as a 
   conversion point, turning Mobile IP registration messages into RADIUS 
   messages and vice versa.

   The operation is as follows: 
     . The Mobile node creates a registration request (RRQ) that 
        includes MN-AAA Authentication extension and various key 
        generation nonce request extensions [MIPKEY]. The latter 
        extensions are included by the MN to request key material that 
        is needed for establishment of MSA between the MN and the Mobile 
        IP HA. The former extension is included to help the AAAH to 
        authenticate the MN on behalf of the HA as follows 
         Authenticator = MD5( 0 || Key ||  
         MD5(Preceding Mobile IP data || 
         Type, Subtype (if present), Length, SPI) || 
         237 octets of zeros)

   (Note: the 0 octets in the authenticator for the co-located case are 
   inserted instead of the octets used from the challenge in the FA-
   based CoA case to preserve interoperability). The use of challenge in 
   co-located case is not required.) 
    
     . The Mobile IP home agent (HA) receives a registration request 
        (RRQ) and builds a RADIUS Access Request message and includes 
        the following attributes into the message. The attributes 
        included inside parentheses are optional. Note that the HA 
        hashes the RRQ along with some other information before forming 
        the MIP-HASH-RRQ to adhere to RADIUS attribute size limitation 
        (253 bytes). This is explained in the attributes section. Note 
        that, the MIP-feature-vector attribute includes a list of flags 
        indicating a variety of information to the AAA server. 
                                      
                  RADIUS-Access Request { 
                  User-Name (MIP-MN-NAI or MIP-MN-HoA), 
                  NAS-IP (MIP-HA-IP address or MIP-HA-NAI) 
                  MIP-HASH-RRQ, 
                  MIP-MN-AAA-SPI, 
                  MIP-MN-AAA-Authenticator, 
                  MIP-feature-vector 
                  Message-Authenticator (80)} 
                                      
     . The AAAH verifies the authentication data, by computing the MN-
        AAA-Authenticator value (using MIP-HASH-RRQ and MIP-MN-AAA-SPI) 
        and comparing to what received in MIP-MN-AAA-Authenticator 
        attribute. If there is a match, the AAAH generates the MN-HA key 
        to be distributed to the HA,  the nonce to be distributed to the 
        MN for MN-HA key derivation and sends a RADIUS Access Accept 
        packet to the Mobile IP home agent. The access accept packet 
        includes the attributes listed below: 
       
                  RADIUS Access Accept { 
                  MIP-MN-to-HA SPI, 
                  MIP-HA-to-MN-SPI, 
                  Encrypted [MIP-MN-HA-key], 
                  MIP-MN-HA-nonce, 
                  MIP-MN-HA-ALGID, 
                  MIP-MN-HA-REP, 
                  MIP-MN-HA-MSA-LIFE 
                  Message-Authenticator (80) 
                  } 
     . In case of authentication failure, the AAAH generates a RADIUS 
        Access-Reject packet. 
    
     . The HA receives the RADIUS Access Accept, retrieves the key 
        material from the attributes (MIP-MN-HA key) for itself and 
        builds the HA to MN MSA using and MN to HA MSAs, using the MIP-

        HA-to-MN SPI and MIP-MN-to-HA SPI, MIP-MN-HA-ALGID, MIP-MN_HA-
        REP and MIP-MN-HA-MSA-LIFE. Reception of RADIUS Access Accept is 
        a sign of successful MN authentication. Thus, the HA processes 
        the Mobile IP RRQ and generates a Mobile IP registration reply 
        (RRP). The home agent also extracts the nonce for the MN and 
        includes it in a MN-HA-key generation nonce reply extension, 
        calculates an MN-HA Authentication extension based on the HA-to-
        MN SPI and received MN-HA key. 
     
     . The MN extracts the nonces from the RRP, derives the MN-HA key 
        and verifies the MN-HA authentication extension. If successful, 
        the MN builds the MSA with the HA. 
    
  3.2 Registration through a Foreign Agent 
    
   When the MN uses FA based CoAs, it needs to send its registration 
   request to the FA. The block and message diagrams are shown in 
   Figures 2a and 2b.

   Figure 2b- Mobile IP and RADIUS messaging when FA-based CoAs are used 
 
     . An MN being served by an FA, with whom the MN does not have an 
        MSA, forms a registration request (RRQ) including MN-AAA 
        authentication extension and MN-HA-key-generation-nonce-request, 
        MN-FA-key-generation-nonce-request [MIPKEYS] and challenge 
        extensions [RFC 3012] and sends this message to FA. The MN 
        calculates the MN-AAA-Authenticator as follows 
          
         Authenticator = MD5( 
         High-order byte from Challenge || Key || 
         MD5(Preceding Mobile IP data || 
         Type, Subtype (if present), Length, SPI) || 
         Least-order 237 bytes from Challenge) 
          
     . The FA checks the challenge and extracts the necessary 
        information from the RRQ to form the attributes to be included 
        in a RADIUS Access Request message. The FA sends this request 
        towards the AAA infrastructure (either AAAF or to AAAH 
        directly). The FA calculates a hash of the RRQ as follows and

        inserts in MIP-HASH-RRQ. The FA may set the appropriate flags 
        within MIP-feature vector to indicate to the AAAH that it 
        requires keys for FA-MN-MSA and FA-HA-MSA. The FA need to also 
        create the SPIs for any MSAs for which it requests key material 
        from AAA server. The following attributes are included in this 
        request: 
                  RADIUS-Access Request { 
                  User-Name (MIP-MN-HoA or MIP-MN-NAI) 
                  NAS-IP (MIP-FA-IP-address 
                  MIP-HA-IP-address (or MIP-FA-NAI if the HA address is 
                  all 1s or all 0s), 
                  MIP-MN-AAA-SPI, 
                  MIP-MN-FA challenge, 
                  MIP-HASH-RRQ, 
                  MIP-MN-AAA-Authenticator, 
                  MIP-feature-vector 
                  Message-Authenticator(80)} 
                         
     . The RADIUS Access request will eventually arrive at the AAAH 
        through the AAA infrastructure. The AAAH server computes its own 
        copy of the MN-AAA authenticator as follows: 
    
         Authenticator = MD5( 
         High-order byte from Challenge || Key || 
         Value of MIP-HASH-RRQ || 
         Least-order 237 bytes from Challenge) 
    
     . The AAAH compares this value with what it has received in MIP-
        MN-AAA-Authenticator attribute from FA. If authentication is 
        successful, the AAAH generates the FA-HA key (if required), the 
        MN-FA key and the MN-FA nonce for MN (for MN-FA MSA) and sends a 
        RADIUS Access-Accept message including the following attributes 
        to the FA 
                   
                  RADIUS Access Accept { 
                  Encrypted [MIP-FA-HA key], 
                  MIP-FA-to-HA-SPI,

     . The FA retrieves the MN-FA key, FA-HA key and other materials 
        related to MN-FA MSAs and FA-HA MSAs from the received Access-
        Request. The FA builds the MSA with the HA and relays the 
        initial registration request including the MN-AAA Authentication 
        extension to the HA. In this message, the FA appends the FA-HA 
        Authentication extension with the authenticator computed using 
        the received FA-HA key. The FA-HA authentication extension also 
        includes the SPI that is copied from the received MIP-FA-to-HA-
        SPI attribute.  
    
     . Upon receiving the registration request from the FA, The HA 
        creates a new RADIUS Access Request for the AAAH and includes 
        the attributes shown below. The HA builds the hash of the RRQ 
        and HA sets the appropriate flags within the MIP-feature-vector 
        attribute to request keys from the AAAH for the HA-MN-MSA and 
        HA-FA-MSA.

                  User-Name (MIP-MN-NAI or MIP-MN-HoA)

                  MIP-FA-IP address, 
                  MIP-MN-FA challenge,

                  Message_Authenticator (80)} 
                   
     . The AAAH finds the FA-HA MSA based on the included MIP-FA-to-HA-
        SPI and validates the FA-HA authenticator first. If the FA-HA 
        authentication is successful, the AAAH proceeds to validate the 
        MN-AAA authenticator, using MN-AAA SPI (MIP-MN-AAA-SPI 
        attribute). After validating the MN-AAA authenticator, the AAAH 
        creates the MN-HA key and the corresponding nonces for MN-HA 
        MSAs and sends a RADIUS Access Accept to the HA including the 
        following attributes. Notes that both the all nonces for the MN 
        (including those for MN-FA MSAs) are sent through this message 
        to help the HA with one stop processing of the registration 
        reply. The HA-FA and the MN-HA keys must be encrypted with the 
        security association shared by the AAAH and HA.

        attributes included in the RADIUS access Accept message from the 
        AAAH and builds a Mobile IP registration reply for the mobile 
        node. The HA includes MN-FA-nonce and MN-HA nonce and related 
        information into specified nonce reply extensions [MIPKEYS], 
        builds MN-HA authentication extension and FA-HA Authentication 
        extension (computed with received MN-HA key and FA-HA key, 
        respectively) and sends the RRP to the FA. 
    
     . The FA relays the RRP back to the MN as described in [RFC 3344] 
        and [MIPKEYS] after building the MN-FA authentication extension 
        when required. 
    
  4.  RADIUS entity requirements 
    
  4.1  RADIUS server and routing requirements 
    
   The RADIUS servers are required to be able to understand and process 
   the attributes described in this specification. The RADIUS server is 
   also required to be able to support the authentication, key and nonce 
   generation procedures described in this document.  
 
   User-Password(2), CHAP-Password(3), CHAP challenge(60), and ARAP-
   Password(70) MUST not be present in an Access-Request packet 
   containing the attributes discussed in this document. 
    
   As per RFC2869 packets that do not contain the above attribute MUST 
   contain the Message-Authenticator(80).  Therefore upon receiving the 
   Access-Request packets that contain Message-Authenticator(80) 
   attribute, the RADIUS server MUST validate the value of the Message-
   Authenticator(80) as described in [RFC2869].  If the authenticator 
   fails to validate, the RADIUS server MUST silently discard the 
   Access-Request packet.  An Access-Request packet which does not 
   contain a Message-Authenticator (80) MUST be silently discarded.

                    RADIUS Mobile IPv4 extensions       February 2005 
 
 
   Message-Authenticator (80) SHOULD also be included in the Access-
   Accept packet.  The Message-Authenticator (80) calculation is 
   described in RFC2869. 
    
   In addition to the processing defined in this document after 
   successful authentication the RADIUS server may include other 
   authorization attributes in the Access-Accept packets that correspond 
   to other features that are supported by the mobility agents. 
 
  4.2  Mobile IP agent requirements 
    
   In this document both the FA and HA operate as a client of RADIUS.  
   They are responsible for passing user information to designated 
   RADIUS servers, and acting on the responses received thereafter.  In 
   the context of RFC-2865 the FA and HA are NASes. This means when 
   sending RADIUS Access Requests, the HA and FA may send their own IP 
   addresses inside NAS-IP attribute instead of MIP-HA-IP-address and 
   MIP-FA-IP-address attributes (suggested in this document), 
   respectively. However, when the Access Request is sent from the FA to 
   the AAAH, the IP address or NAI of the HA needs to be included to the 
   message for authentication and key generation purposes. The use of 
   MIP-HA-NAI and MIP-FA-NAI may required for Mobile IP signaling.  
 
   In roaming situations, RADIUS servers typically route the Access-
   Request using the User-Name(1) attribute which contains an NAI [RFC 
   2486bis].  Therefore, Mobile IP Agents SHOULD populate the User-
   Name(1) attribute with the NAI value received in the RRQ when the MN-
   NAI extension is provided. 
    
   When the MN-NAI extension is not provided, the User-Name (1) should 
   be constructed using the MN HoA IP address. 
    
   User-Password(2), CHAP-Password(3), CHAP challenge(60), and ARAP-
   Password(70) MUST not be present in an Access-Request packet 
   containing the attributes discussed in this document.  In these 
   cases, the Mobile IP agent must include the Message-Authenticator 
   (80) in the Access-Accept packet.  The Message-Authenticator (80) is 
   to be computed as per RFC2869. 
    
   If the Access-Accept packet contains a Message-Authenticator (80) 
   then the Mobile IP agent MUST validate the contents by computing the 
   authenticator as describe in RFC2869.  If the authenticator is not 
   valid then the Mobile IP agent MUST silently discard the Access-
   Accept packet.  If the Mobile IP agent receives an Access-Accept 
   packet that does not contain the Message-Authenticator it MUST 
   silently discard the Access-Accept.

                    RADIUS Mobile IPv4 extensions       February 2005 
 
 
   Once the Message-Authenticator (80) attribute has been validated, the 
   Mobile-IP agent decrypts the protected attributes as per RFC2868. 
 
   This document does not address RADIUS accounting from the Mobile-IP 
   agent and therefore whether RADIUS accounting packet are sent is not 
   within scope of this document.

   have an HoA (RFC 3344 section 3.6), and sets the HoA field in the 
   registration request to all 0s or all 1s, the MN-NAI extension 
   becomes mandatory.

      Mobile IPv4 Foreign Agent Challenge 
   There is a Challenge Extension defined in RFC 3012 section 4.  
   This attribute can be included in Access Request from FA to AAA and 
   from the HA to the AAA, since it is used in the MN-AAA authentication 
   extension.

   String  
          AAA SPI [MIPKEYS]. 
    
   The AAA server uses this SPI to locate the security context needed to 
   verify the MN-AAA authenticator calculated by the MN over the 
   registration request data. The security context includes the MN-AAA 
   key, and key related information and the algorithm used for 
   calculation of authenticator fields.

   String  
      MN-AAA authenticator value 
    
   This attribute carries the value of MN-AAA-authenticator within the 
   MN-AAA Authentication extension.  
   The value is calculated based on a hash of RRQ and other information. 
   The general expression (used for FA-based mobile nodes) is as follows 
   Authenticator = MD5( 
         High-order byte from Challenge || Key || 
         MD5(Preceding Mobile IP data || 
         Type, Subtype (if present), Length, SPI) || 
         Least-order 237 bytes from Challenge) 
   For co-located mobile nodes, which register directly with the HA, no 
   challenge value exists and therefore the values related to challenge 
   are replaced with zero octets in the expression above.

               256 Co-located-Mobile-Node  
    
   This attribute is added to the RADIUS access request message. 
   For instance, when the MN has included a nonce generation request 
   extension for MN-HA SA, the mobility agent (FA in FA CoA case and HA 
   in CcoA case) sets the MN-HA key request flag in the MIP feature 
   vector attribute included in the RADIUS access request message to 
   indicate to the AAA that the MN requires nonces for MN-HA SA. 
   The same goes for MN-FA nonce generation request extension from MN. 
   When an FA is being used and FA requires keying material from the AAA 
   server, the FA sets the FA-HA-key request flag.

  6.  Diameter compatibility considerations 
 
   Diameter Mobile IP application has defined new command codes for 
   support of Mobile IP signaling such as, AA-Mobile node request (AMR), 
   AA-Mobile Node answer (AMA), Home agent MIP-request (HMR), Home agent 
   MIP-answer (HMA). RADIUS currently does not any messages that 
   correspond to these Diameter commands. However RADIUS provides the 
   flexibility of defining new command codes. The solution in this draft 
   is designed based on the assumption that the RADIUS community (and 
   RADEXT) is not interested in defining new RADIUS messages hence we 
   will be using RADIUS access request and RADIUS access accept for 
   providing messaging from mobility agents to RADIUS server and vice 
   versa. This would impose new complexity on the Diameter-RADIUS 
   interaction. On the other hand, we tried to follow the Diameter 
   attribute type definition model to extent possible for RADIUS. One 
   exception is the fact that RADIUS does not have any support for 
   grouped attributes and that is why attributes relating to 
   authentication extensions and security associations are designed with 
   a ôflatö structure. 
 
    
  7.  IANA considerations 
    
   This draft introduces new RADIUS attributes. Therefore there is need 
   for defining new attribute type numbers by IANA. 
    
  8.  Security considerations 
    
   Mobile IP (RFC 3344) specifies a Foreign-Home authentication 
   extension for protecting the integrity of messaging between FA and 
   HA. This is especially important when the FA directly forwards the 
   registration request to the HA. However, this extension is optional, 
 
 
Nakhjiri et. al.        Expires û August 2005               [Page 25] 
                    RADIUS Mobile IPv4 extensions       February 2005 
 
 
   since for scalability reasons, it is difficult to establish SAs 
   between large number of FAs and Has. Not using this extension opens 
   the door for DoS attacks launched by the FA against the HA.  
   Another possible attack is DoS attacks by MNs using large numbers of 
   Mobile IP RRQs. Therefore, we require that the FA implements the 
   challenge response mechanism in RFC 3012 and forwards the challenge 
   inside RRQ to the HA. 
    
   Another security concern is on the distribution of keys from the AAA 
   server to mobility agents. The AAAH creates and distributes keys for 
   the Mobile IP agents and nonces for mobile nodes. The key transfer 
   must happen through a secure manner. This means, the MSA-attributes 
   including HA and FA keys must be encrypted with the security 
   associations between the AAAH and the mobility agents. Such security 
   association may be based on RADIUS shared secrets (hop by hop) or 
   based on end-to-end SAs (possibly IPsec) between the AAAH and the 
   mobility agents. For foreign agents, other trusted AAA servers (such 
   as AAAF and AAAF-AAAH keys) may have to be involved. Also, it is 
   important that the keys for each mobility agent are kept hidden from 
   other mobility agents. For instance keys for FA must be kept secret 
   from HA. This means the AAA server must have separate keys with each 
   of the HA and FAs.  On the other hand, the nonces generated by the 
   AAA server, destined to the mobile can be transmitted in the clear. 
   The MN-FA and MN-HA nonces are protected by the FA and HA 
   authentications to the MN. However, to prevent man-in-the-middle 
   tampering with the nonces in transit from AAAH to the HA and to FA to 
   the MN, We recommend that the AAAH also authenticates the nonce reply 
   extensions with the AAA SA it shares with the MN. 
    
   Finally, we assume the following formula is used by the MN for 
   generating the key out of the nonce: 
   key = HMAC-SHA1 (AAA-key, {Key Generation Nonce || home address}) 
    
   Which means two things: 1) AAA server needs the MN home address to 
   generate the keys to be sent to mobility agents. 2) We are assuming 
   SHA1 is used as a hash function as opposed to MD-5 when tighter 
   security is required. 
    
   For RADIUS threats and vulnerabilities please refer to the Security 
   Section in RFC3579.
