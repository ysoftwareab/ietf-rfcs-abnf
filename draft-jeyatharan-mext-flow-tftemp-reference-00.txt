                  3GPP TFT Reference for Flow Binding
             draft-jeyatharan-mext-flow-tftemp-reference-00

Abstract

   This memo describes a reference to third generation partner ship
   project (3GPP) defined traffic flow template (TFT) as a traffic
   selector in the flow based routing mechanism described in the flow
   binding draft [1].  This memo, further specifies a new traffic
   selector sub-option format to be used with the flow binding mobility
   option defined in draft [1], in order to transport the TFT reference
   from the mobile node to its home agent in a 3GPP SAE (service
   architecture evolution) scenario.

Internet-Draft                TFT Reference                   March 2010


1.  Introduction

   A mobile node which has the ability to manage its mobility as
   described in RFC-3775 [2], RFC-3963 [8] or RFC-5555 [9] may connect
   to the operator's core network using multiple interfaces as described
   in RFC-5648 [3].  After attaching to the core network using multiple
   interfaces, the mobile node can then set flow based routing rules at
   its home agent using the method outlined in draft MEXT-FlowBinding
   [1].  MEXT-FlowBinding [1] specifies a method for the mobile node to
   send the flow identifier mobility option and the traffic selector
   sub-option in the binding update mobility header.  The flow
   identifier mobility option is used to specify the routing rules and
   the traffic selector sub-option is used to characterize the flows to
   which the routing rules apply.  The flow binding mechanism can be
   used with any traffic selector sub-option format.  Currently defined
   traffic selector is the binary format specified in [4].

   In 3GPP evolved packet system (EPS), QoS is provisioned by creating
   multiple EPS bearer [5].  Each EPS bearer is identified by a EPS
   bearer identifier (ID) and may be associated with different QoS
   parameters such as the QoS class indicator (QCI), maximum bit-rate,
   guaranteed bit rate, etc.  All traffic sent along a given EPS bearer
   will enjoy the same level of QoS.

   In order to forward flows according to their subscribed QoS classes,
   the EPS bearers are each associated with Traffic Flow Template (TFT)
   which contain a list of Packet Filters [6].  Each packet filter
   describes a flow by parameters such as remote party (correspondent
   node) IP address, source and destination port numbers, flow label,
   transport protocol etc.  With TFTs, both the network and the mobile
   node can make the selection of the appropriate EPS bearer to forward
   a given packet so that correct QoS treatment is used when forwarding
   the packet.


2.  Motivation

   There is a 3GPP release 10 standardization effort as described in
   [10] which allows simultaneous 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses and flow
   mobility for mobile nodes that have client based mobility management
   protocols.  The mobile node may set flow based routing rules using
   the method outlined in draft MEXT-FlowBinding [1] to select the
   interface for the delivery of a particular flow.  When the flow is
   directed to the 3GPP interface, the TFT mechanism is then used to
   select which EPS bearer to deliver the flow so that appropriate QoS
   treatment can be applied.

   A likely scenario is for the mobile node to set the non-3GPP



Jeyatharan & Ng         Expires September 3, 2010               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                TFT Reference                   March 2010


   interface as the default interface, and use the 3GPP interface for
   flows that require QoS treatment.  In such cases, it is necessary for
   the mobile node to set the flow based routing rules correctly so that
   the flows are routed to the 3GPP interface.  The routing rules set in
   this situation is likely to be identical to the TFTs installed for
   the EPS bearers.  In this memo, the term routing filter refers to
   flow filter that is described in MEXT-FlowBinding [1] and will be
   used interchangeably.  Additionally, when the TFT is changed (eg. to
   accommodate additional flows for guaranteed QoS treatment, or an
   existing flow is no longer qualified to enjoy special QoS treatment),
   it is expected for the mobile node to modify corresponding routing
   rules accordingly.

   Based on the above, it will be beneficial for there to be a mechanism
   for the mobile node to reference the TFT installed in a particular
   EPS bearer as the filter description in the binding update message.
   This reduces the size of binding update messages, reduces the amount
   of binding update messages needed, and also eliminates the
   possibility of a flow not getting appropriate QoS treatment due to a
   mismatch between the routing rules and the installed TFT.  With this
   in mind, the objective of this memo is to introduce mechanism for
   referencing a TFT installed on an EPS bearer when setting filter
   rules using the flow binding mechanism as described in MEXT-Binding
   [1].

   Section 4 will first present an overview of installing routing
   filters using TFT as a reference for flows.  Next, Section 5 lists
   the required protocol changes to carry the reference to TFT as a new
   traffic selector sub-option called the TFT reference traffic selector
   sub-option.  The mobile node and home agent operations with respect
   to this new TFT reference traffic selector are then described in
   Section 6 and Section 7 respectively.  Finally, Section 8 discusses
   the IANA support needed and Section 9 discusses the security
   considerations.


3.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [7].

Internet-Draft                TFT Reference                   March 2010


4.1.  Setting up Flow Filters

   When a mobile node simultaneously attaches to both a 3GPP access and
   a non-3GPP access, and has TFT installed in one or more EPS Bearer on
   the 3GPP access, the mobile node will send a binding update (i) to
   perform a simultaneously at home and away binding as described in
   RFC-5648 [3] and (ii) to install routing filters corresponding to the
   TFTs to ensure that flows which are eligible for QoS treatment be
   routed to the 3GPP access.  For example, if there is a TFT containing
   packet filters which route a video flow to an EPS bearer of EPS
   bearer ID 1, the mobile node sends a binding update (BU) to ensure
   that the video flow is routed to the 3GPP access by the home agent.
   This is done by including a TFT reference traffic selector sub-option
   to indicate to the home agent that a routing rule should be generated
   from the TFT associated with the EPS bearer that is referenced in the
   TFT reference traffic selector sub-option.  Figure 1 illustrates the
   contents of the BU message.  The BU mobility header will contain two
   Binding Identifier (BID) mobility option to bind the 3GPP access as a
   home binding and the non-3GPP access as a care-of binding.  Since
   non-3GPP access is the default interface, it is set with a low BID
   priority value (implying high priority).  A Flow Identifier (FID)
   mobility option is included that carries the TFT reference traffic
   selector sub-option (described in Section 5.1), and will carry a
   reference to EPS bearer ID 1.

     IPv6 Header
     BU Mobility Header
     Mobility Options
       BID option [for care-of binding of non-3GPP access]
       BID option [for home binding of 3GPP access]
       FID option
         TFT reference traffic selector sub-option [EPS bearer ID 1]

      Figure 1: BU packet with TFT reference when non-3GPP is default
                                  access

   Once the home agent receives and successfully process such binding
   update message with TFT reference traffic selector sub-option, it
   will install the corresponding simultaneous at home and away
   registration.  The home agent will also locate the packet filters in
   the TFTs referred to by the TFT reference traffic selector sub-option
   and install relevant routing rules based on a one-to-one conversion
   from each located Packet Filter.

4.2.  Refreshing Flow Filters

   Once the routing filters using TFT reference is set, the mobile node
   can refresh the routing filters the same way as described in MEXT-

Internet-Draft                TFT Reference                   March 2010


   Binding [1].  When the home agent receives a refresh binding update
   that contains a FID that refers to a TFT reference, the home agent
   should re-generate the routing filters from the referenced TFT in
   case there is modification in the TFT.

4.3.  Modification of TFTs

   Modification of TFT can happen when a new packet filter is added to a
   TFT associated with an EPS bearer, or a packet filter is removed from
   a TFT associated with an EPS bearer.  When the mobile node detects
   such a modification, it can perform a refresh operation by sending a
   BU message containing a FID option which refers to the modified TFT.
   When the home agent receives a refresh binding update that contains a
   FID that refers to a TFT reference, the home agent should re-generate
   the routing filters from the referenced TFT.

4.4.  Removal of TFTs

   TFT may be removed when the EPS bearer is torn down, or simply de-
   associated from the EPS bearer.  When the mobile node detects the
   removal of a TFT, it should send a BU message to remove the FID that
   previously referred to this TFT.  This follows the same filter
   deletion operation as specified in MEXT-Binding [1].


5.  Modification to Existing Protocol

   A new traffic selector extension to the flow binding process
   described in MEXT-Binding [1] is described here.  It is in parallel
   to binary format traffic selector sub-option [4].  A new TFT
   reference traffic selector sub-option is defined.

5.1.  TFT Reference Traffic Selector Sub-option Format

   The TFT Reference Traffic Selector format is used to carry a
   reference to a TFT.  It is included in the FID Option of a Binding
   Update Mobility Header.

   Sub-Opt Type

      A value of 3 is already assigned in draft MEXT-FlowBinding [1].

   Sub-Opt Length

      An 8-bit unsigned integer, representing the length in octets of
      the TFT reference traffic selector sub-option.  This field
      indicates the length of the sub-option not including the Sub-opt
      Type and Sub-opt Length fields.  The value for the Sub-Opt Len
      field is 3 for this TFT Reference Traffic Selector Sub-option.

   TS Format

      An 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the Traffic Selector Format.
      Value "0" is reserved and SHOULD NOT be used.  The Traffic
      Selector value needs to be assigned by IANA.

   Reserved

      An 8-bit reserved field.  It SHOULD be set to zero by the sender
      and ignored by the receiver.

   TFT Reference

      This is an 8 bit field used to carry the EPS bearer ID.



6.  Mobile Node Operation

   When creating a flow binding BU, the needed mobility options in
   passing routing rules to the home agent, format of the BU tied to
   ordering of the relevant mobility options and sub-options and
   alignment requirement MUST follow the considerations given in MEXT-
   FlowBinding [1].  The create, refresh, modification and delete
   operations tied to flow filtering MUST follow procedures outlined in
   MEXT-FlowBinding [1].  The Binding Acknowledgment to the flow binding
   BU MUST be processed as described in MEXT-FlowBinding [1].

   When creating flow binding rules whereby the mobile node wants flows
   tied to existing TFTs to be sent via 3GPP access or non-3GPP access,
   it must use flow binding mechanism whereby, the FID option in the BU
   is attached with a TFT reference traffic selector sub-option.  The
   mobile node MUST set the TFT reference field to the EPS bearer ID for
   which the TFT is referred from in the TFT reference traffic selector
   sub-option.

Internet-Draft                TFT Reference                   March 2010


   If there are multiple TFTs (i.e. multiple EPS bearers) to refer from,
   the mobile node MUST use a FID option for each TFT and attach a TFT
   reference traffic selector sub-option to each such FID option in the
   initial flow binding set up procedures.  Flow binding for multiple
   TFTs can be performed in an individual manner by means of individual
   BUs or as a bulk manner as outlined in MEXT-FlowBinding [1].

   When a TFT is removed in the 3GPP access, the mobile node MUST send a
   delete filter message for the FID linked to the TFT as described in
   MEXT-FlowBinding [1].

   When a TFT is modified, the mobile node SHOULD send a refresh BU to
   request the home agent to re-generate the routing rules from the
   referred TFT.


7.  Home Agent Operation

   The processing of the create, refresh, modify and delete flow binding
   update at the home agent will be according to MEXT-FlowBinding [1].
   Only when the TFT reference traffic selector sub-option is found in
   create state, the home agent will use this option to setup flow
   binding rules.

   Once the home agent receives and successfully process binding update
   message with TFT reference traffic selector sub-option it will create
   the flow routing table as disclosed in MEXT-FlowBinding [1].  The
   home agent will locate the packet filters in the TFTs referred to by
   the TFT reference traffic selector sub-option and install relevant
   routing rules based on a one-to-one conversion from each located
   Packet Filter.  How the home agent can locate the packet filters and
   generate routing rules from the packet filters is out of scope of
   this document.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This draft introduces a new value for the traffic selector format
   field in the traffic selector sub-option.  This new traffic selector
   value for the traffic selector format field needs to be assigned by
   IANA.



9.  Security Considerations

   This draft does not need any new security mechanism and the security
   mechanism specified in draft MEXT-FlowBinding [1] is adequate to

   carry the flow binding rules with TFT reference as the new traffic
   selector format for the traffic selector sub-option.
