Abstract

    In some cases, it is desirable to have a string matching mechanism
    which is more powerful than a simple exact match, a substring match
    or a glob-style wildcard match.  The regular expression matching
    mechanism defined in this draft should allow users to isolate just
    about any string or address in a message header or envelope.

Internet Draft          Sieve -- Regex Extension          March 10, 2000



0.     Meta-information on this draft

    This information is intended to facilitate discussion.  It will be
    removed when this document leaves the Internet-Draft stage.


0.1.   Discussion

    This draft is intended to be an extension to the Sieve mail filtering
    language, available from the Internet-Drafts repository as
    <ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-showalter-sieve-09.txt>
    (where 09 is the version number, which is actually currently 09).

    This draft and the Sieve language itself are being discussed on the
    MTA Filters mailing list at <ietf-mta-filters@imc.org>.  Subscription
    requests can be sent to <ietf-mta-filters-request@imc.org> (send an
    email message with the word "subscribe" in the body).  More
    information on the mailing list along with a WWW archive of back
    messages is available at <http://www.imc.org/ietf-mta-filters/>.


0.2.   Changes since revision 00

    Added POSIX.2 ERE summary.

    Added examples.

    Editorial changes.


1.  Introduction

    This is an extension to the Sieve language defined by [SIEVE] for
    comparing strings to regular expressions.

    Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1, including
    use of [KEYWORDS].


2.  Capability Identifier

    The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
    document is "regex".

Internet Draft          Sieve -- Regex Extension          March 10, 2000


3.  Regex Match Type

    Commands that support matching may take the optional tagged argument
    ":regex" to specify that a regular expression match should be
    performed.  The ":regex" match type is subject to the same rules and
    restrictions as the standard match types defined in [SIEVE].

    The ":regex" match type is compatible with both the "i;octet" and
    "i;ascii-casemap" comparators and may be used with them.

    Implementations MUST support extended regular expressions (EREs) as
    defined by [POSIX.2].  Any regular expression not defined by
    [POSIX.2], including [POSIX.2] basic regular expressions, word
    boundaries and backreferences are not supported by this extension.

    The following table provides a brief summary of the regular
    expressions that MUST be supported.  This table is presented here
    only as a guideline.  [POSIX.2] should be used as the definitive
    reference.

    NOTE: A double-backslash is needed to escape a special character, as
    per section 2.4.2 of [SIEVE].

            not address :regex ["to", "cc", "bcc"]
              "me(\\+.*)?@company.com",

            # or the subject contains 2 or more dollar signs,
            header :regex "subject" "\\$\\$+",

            # or the subject is all uppercase (no lowercase)

4.  Security Considerations

    Security considerations are discussed in [SIEVE].  It is believed
    that this extension doesn't introduce any additional security
    concerns.
