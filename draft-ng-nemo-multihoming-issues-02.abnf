w=1 implies a mobile network has only a single mobile router. In
         this case, the mobile router either has multiple egress
         interfaces or multiple home addresses bound to a single egress
         interface.

w=N implies a mobile network has more than one mobile router
         advertising an egress route.

x=1 implies that a single home agent is assigned to manage binding
         updates of the mobile network.
x=N implies that more than one home agents (possibly in different
         administrative domains) manage the binding updates of the
         mobile network.

y=1 implies that a single subnet prefix is advertised to the
         mobile network nodes.

y=N implies that more than one subnet prefixes are advertised to
         the mobile network nodes.
