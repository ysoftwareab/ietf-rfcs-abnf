Abstract

   This document intents to provide a general and all-round multicast
   model, which tries to stand at a high level to take full advantages
   of existed multicast protocol models to control the multicast
   network, and guides the deployment of multicast service.  And also,
   there will define several possible RPCs about how to interact between
   multicast info model and multicast protocol models.  This multicast
   information model is mainly used by the management tools run by the
   network operators in order to manage, monitor and debug the network
   resources used to deliver multicast service, as well as gathering
   some data from the network.

1.  Introduction

   Currently, there are many multicast YANG models, such as PIM, MLD,
   and BIER and so on.  But all these models are distributed in
   different working groups as separate files and focus on the protocol
   itself.  Furthermore, they cannot describe a high-level multicast
   service required by network operators.

   This document intents to provide a general and all-round multicast
   model, which tries to stand at a high level to take full advantages
   of these aforementioned models to control the multicast network, and
   guides the deployment of multicast service.

   This multicast information model is mainly used by the management
   tools run by the network operators in order to manage, monitor and
   debug the network resources used to deliver multicast service, as
   well as gathering some data from the network.

           +------------------------------------------------+


                Figure 1: Example usage of Multicast Model

   Detailly,in figure 1, there is an example of usage of this multicast
   model.  Network operators can input this model to a controller who is
   responsible to translate the information and invoke the corresponding
   protocol models into configurations to configure the network elements
   through NETCONF/RESTCONF/CLI.  Or network operators can input this
   model to the EMS/NMS to manage the network elements or configure the
   network elements directly.  On the other hand, when the network
   elements detect failure or some other changes, the network operators
   can collect these kind of notifications through this model to assist
   locating the exact failure and responsing immediatly. for example,
   when the network element suffers a failure of one MVPN neighbor, it
   can notify to the EMS/NMS or Controller or to other Multicast Model
   management tool directly to let the network operator take actions
   immediately.

   Specifically, in section 3, it provides a human readability of the
   whole multicast network through UML class diagram, which frames
   different multicast components and correlates them in a readable
   fashion.  Then, based on this UML class diagram, there is
   instantiated and detailed YANG model in Section 5.

   In other words, this document does not define any specific protocol
   model, instead, it depends on many existed multicast protocol models
   and relates several multicast information together to fulfill
   multicast service.

2.  Design of the multicast model

   This model includes three layers: the multicast overlay, the
   transport layer and the multicast underlay information.

   Multicast overlay defines the features of multicast flow, such
   as(vpnid, multicast source and multicast group) information, and
   (ingress-node,egress-nodes) nodes information.  If the transport
   layer is BIER, there may define BIER information including
   (Subdomain, ingress-node BFR-id, egress-nodes BFR-id).  In data
   center network, for fine-grained to gather the nodes belonging to the
   same virtual network, there may need VNI-related information to
   assist.  If no (ingress-node, egress-nodes) information are defined
   directly, there may need overlay multicast signaling technology, such
   as MLD or MVPN, to collect these nodes information.

   Multicast transport layer defines the type of transport technologies
   that can be used to forward multicast flow, including BIER forwarding
   type, MPLS forwarding type, or PIM forwarding type and so on.  One or
   several transport technologies could be defined at the same time.  As
   for the detailed parameters for each transport technology, this
   multicast information model can invoke the corresponding protocol
   model to define them.

   Multicast underlay defines the type of underlay technologies, such as
   OSPF, ISIS, BGP, PIM or BABEL and so on.  One or several underlay
   technologies could be defined at the same time.  As for the specific
   parameters for each underlay technology, this multicast information
   model can depend the corresponding protocol model to configure them
   as well.
