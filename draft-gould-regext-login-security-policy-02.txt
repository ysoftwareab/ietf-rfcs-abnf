1.  Introduction

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730].  This document
   describes an extension of the Registry Mapping
   [I-D.gould-carney-regext-registry] to define the server policy of the
   Login Security EPP extension [I-D.gould-regext-login-security] for a
   registry system.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
   represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a REQUIRED feature of this protocol.

   The XML namespace prefix "loginSecPolicy" is used for the namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:loginSecPolicy-0.3", but implementations
   MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML
   parser and serializer to interpret and output the XML documents.

   The XML namespace prefix "loginSec" is used for the namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:loginSec-0.1", as defined in
   [I-D.gould-regext-login-security], but implementations MUST NOT
   depend on it and instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser
   and serializer to interpret and output the XML documents.

2.  Object Attributes

   An EPP login security policy has attributes and associated values
   that may be viewed and modified by the sponsoring client or the
   server.  This section describes each attribute type in detail.  The
   formal syntax for the attribute values described here can be found in
   the "Formal Syntax" section of this document and in the appropriate
   normative references.

2.1.  Dates and Times

   Date and time attribute values MUST be represented in Universal
   Coordinated Time (UTC) using the Gregorian calendar.  The extended
   date-time form using upper case "T" and "Z" characters defined in XML
   Schema Part 2 [1] MUST be used to represent date-time values, as XML
   Schema does not support truncated date-time forms or lower case "T"
   and "Z" characters.

2.2.  Event Types

   The <loginSecPolicy:event> element has a REQUIRED "type" attribute
   and an OPTIONAL "name" attribute that defines the security event
   type.  The "name" attribute is used to define a sub-type or the type
   name when the "type" attribute is "custom".  The enumerated list of
   "type" values include:

   "password":  Identifies a password expiry event policy.
   "certificate":  Identifies a client certificate expiry event policy.
   "cipher":  Identifies an insecure or deprecated TLS cipher suite
       event policy.
   "tlsProtocol":  Identifies an insecure or deprecated TLS protocol
       event policy.
   "newPW":  Identifies the new password complexity requirements event
       policy.
   "stat":  Identifies the login security statistical warning event
       policy.  The "name" attribute defines the statistic.
   "custom":  Identifies a custom event type that MUST set the "name"
       attribute with the custom event type name.

2.3.  System Object

   The System object, represented by the <registry:system> element in
   the Registry Mapping [I-D.gould-carney-regext-registry], is the
   object that is extended by this extension with the
   <loginSecPolicy:system> element.  The <loginSecPolicy:system> element
   contains the following child elements:



      <loginSecPolicy:pw>:  The login password format policy.  The
          <loginSecPolicy:pw> element contains the following child
          elements:


          <loginSecPolicy:expression>:  The login password format
              regular expression.  The regular expression MUST conform
              to the Perl-compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) [pcre]
              syntax.  Programming languages support different sets of
              PCRE features, so the server SHOULD define a PCRE that
              leverages features that are supported by a broad set of
              client programming languages.
          <loginSecPolicy:description>:  The OPTIONAL human readable
              description of the login password format policy.  The
              "lang" attribute MAY be present to identify the language
              of the description if the negotiated value is something
              other than the default value of "en" (English).

Internet-Draft               loginsec-policy                January 2019


      <loginSecPolicy:userAgentSupport>:  OPTIONAL boolean value that
          indicates the server supports the <loginSec:userAgent>
          element, with the default value of "0" (or "false").  A value
          of "1" (or "true") means that the server processes the
          <loginSec:userAgent> element.  A value of "0" (or "false")
          means that the server ignores the <loginSec:userAgent> element
          if passed by the client.
      <loginSecPolicy:event>:  Zero or more <loginSecPolicy:event>
          elements that defines the policies associated with the
          supported security events.  The required "type" attribute and
          the OPTIONAL "name" attribute defines the event type, as
          described in Section 2.2.  The <loginSecPolicy:event> element
          contains the following child elements:


          <loginSecPolicy:level>:  One or two <loginSecPolicy:level>
              elements that indicate the possible set of event levels
              ("warning" or "error") the server will return to the
              client for the event type.
          <loginSecPolicy:exDate>:  OPTIONAL boolean element that
              indicates whether the event type includes a
              <loginSec:exDate> element with the default value of "0"
              (or "false").
          <loginSecPolicy:exPeriod>:  OPTIONAL duration element that the
              event type must be reset.  For example, the password will
              expire 30 days after being set.
          <loginSecPolicy:warningPeriod>:  OPTIONAL duration element
              that indicates how long prior to expiry the server will
              include a warning event.  For example, the server will
              include a password expiry warning event 15 days prior to
              expiry.
          <loginSecPolicy:errorAction>:  OPTIONAL indication of what
              action will occur with an error, including at expiry when
              <leoginSecPolicy:exDate> is "1" (or "true").  The possible
              <loginSecPolicy:errorAction> values include:


              "connect":  The client connection will fail.  For example,
                  when the client certificate expires, the TLS handshake
                  will fail.
              "login":  The client login will fail.  For example, when
                  the new password does not meet the server password
                  complexity requirements or when the password expires,
                  the login will fail.
              "none":  There is no predefined failure action.  For
                  example, when the password expires, the server will
                  not fail the login.

Internet-Draft               loginsec-policy                January 2019


          <loginSecPolicy:threshold>:  OPTIONAL threshold value that
              triggers a warning event for a specific "stat" event.  For
              example, a "failedLogins" "stat" warning event will occur
              if the number of failed logins exceeds 100.
          <loginSecPolicy:period>:  OPTIONAL period value that is
              associated with a warning event for a specific "stat"
              event.  For example, a "failedLogins" "stat" warning event
              will occur if the number of failed logins exceeds the
              <loginSecPolicy:threshold> value over a period of 1 day.

   Example of a <loginSecPolicy:system> element that defines the
   password policy and the policy of each of the supported login
   security events:

   <loginSecPolicy:system>
     <loginSecPolicy:pw>
       <loginSecPolicy:expression>
         (?=.*\d)
         (?=.*[a-zA-Z])
         (?=.*[\x21-\x2F\x3A-\x40\x5B-\x60\x7B-\x7E])
         (?!^\s+)
         (?!.*\s+$)
         (?!.*\s{2,})
         ^[\x20-\x7e]{16,128}$
       </loginSecPolicy:expression>
       <loginSecPolicy:description>
         16 to 128 printable characters (alphanumeric, space, and
         special characters) with at least one number, letter, and
         special character, with no leading or trailing whitespace,
         and with no consecutive spaces.
       </loginSecPolicy:description>
     </loginSecPolicy:pw>
     <loginSecPolicy:userAgentSupport>true
     </loginSecPolicy:userAgentSupport>
     <loginSecPolicy:event type="newPW">
       <loginSecPolicy:level>error</loginSecPolicy:level>
       <loginSecPolicy:errorAction>login</loginSecPolicy:errorAction>
     </loginSecPolicy:event>
     <loginSecPolicy:event type="password">
       <loginSecPolicy:level>warning</loginSecPolicy:level>
       <loginSecPolicy:level>error</loginSecPolicy:level>
       <loginSecPolicy:exDate>true</loginSecPolicy:exDate>
       <loginSecPolicy:exPeriod>P90D</loginSecPolicy:exPeriod>
       <loginSecPolicy:warningPeriod>P15D</loginSecPolicy:warningPeriod>
       <loginSecPolicy:errorAction>login</loginSecPolicy:errorAction>
     </loginSecPolicy:event>

3.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use in provisioning and
   managing login security policy via EPP.

3.1.  EPP Query Commands

   EPP [RFC5730] provides three commands to retrieve object information:
   <check> to determine if an object is known to the server, <info> to
   retrieve detailed information associated with an object, and
   <transfer> to retrieve object transfer status information.

3.1.1.  EPP <check> Command

   This extension does not define any extension of the EPP <check>
   command or response described in the Registry Mapping.

Internet-Draft               loginsec-policy                January 2019


3.1.2.  EPP <info> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <info> command
   described in the Registry Mapping [I-D.gould-carney-regext-registry].
   However, additional elements are defined for the <info> response to a
   query for the registry system attributes.

   When an <info> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain a child elements as described in the
   Registry Mapping [I-D.gould-carney-regext-registry].  In addition,
   the EPP <extension> element SHOULD contain a child <lp:infData>
   element that identifies the extension namespace if the system object
   has data associated with this extension and based on server policy.
   The <loginSecPolicy:infData> element contains the following child
   elements:

   <lp:system>:  Element that contains the full set of login security
       policy attributes for the system as defined in Section 2.3.

   Example <info> response to query for the registry system attributes
   including the login security policy attributes:

   S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   S:  <response>
   S:    <result code="1000">
   S:      <msg>Command completed successfully</msg>
   S:    </result>
   S:    <resData>
   S:      <registry:infData
   S:        xmlns:registry="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:registry-0.1">
   S:      ...
   S:      </registry:infData>
   S:    </resData>
   S:    <extension>
   S:      <loginSecPolicy:infData
   S:        xmlns:loginSecPolicy=
   S:          "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:loginSecPolicy-0.3">
   S:      ...
   S:      </loginSecPolicy:infData>
   S:    </extension>
   S:    <trID>
   S:      <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   S:      <svTRID>54322-XYZ</svTRID>
   S:    </trID>
   S:  </response>
   S:</epp>

3.1.3.  EPP <transfer> Query Command

   Transfer semantics do not directly apply to system objects, so there
   is no extension defined for the EPP <transfer> query command.

3.2.  EPP Transform Commands

   EPP provides five commands to transform objects: <create> to create
   an instance of an object, <delete> to delete an instance of an
   object, <renew> to extend the validity period of an object,
   <transfer> to manage object sponsorship changes, and <update> to
   change information associated with an object.

3.2.1.  EPP <create> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <create> command
   or <create> response described in the Registry Mapping.

3.2.2.  EPP <delete> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <delete> command
   or <delete> response described in the Registry Mapping.

3.2.3.  EPP <renew> Command

   Renew semantics do not directly apply to system objects, so there is
   no extension defined for the EPP <renew> command.

3.2.4.  EPP <transfer> Command

   Transfer semantics do not directly apply to system objects, so there
   is no extension defined for the EPP <transfer> command.

3.2.5.  EPP <update> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <update> command
   or <update> response described in the Registry Mapping.

4.  Formal Syntax

   One schema presented here is the EPP Login Security Policy Schema.

   The formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation
   of the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.  The BEGIN and END tags are not part of the schema; they
   are used to note the beginning and ending of the schema for URI
   registration purposes.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  XML Namespace

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].

   Registration request for the login security policy namespace:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:loginSecPolicy-0.3
      Registrant Contact: IESG
      XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the login security policy XML schema:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:epp:loginSecPolicy-0.3
      Registrant Contact: IESG
      XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of this document.

5.2.  EPP Extension Registry

   The EPP extension described in this document should be registered by
   the IANA in the EPP Extension Registry described in [RFC7451].  The
   details of the registration are as follows:

Internet-Draft               loginsec-policy                January 2019


   Name of Extension: "Login Security Policy Extensions Mapping for the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)"

   Document status: Standards Track

   Reference: (insert reference to RFC version of this document)

   Registrant Name and Email Address: IESG, <iesg@ietf.org>

   TLDs: Any

   IPR Disclosure: None

   Status: Active

   Notes: None

6.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   RFC 7942 [RFC7942] before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942
   [RFC7942].  The description of implementations in this section is
   intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
   drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual
   implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
   Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
   presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not
   intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
   implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that
   other implementations may exist.

   According to RFC 7942 [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and
   working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
   benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
   experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
   more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups to use this
   information as they see fit".

6.1.  Verisign EPP SDK

   Organization: Verisign Inc.

   Name: Verisign EPP SDK

Internet-Draft               loginsec-policy                January 2019


   Description: The Verisign EPP SDK includes both a full client
   implementation and a full server stub implementation of draft-gould-
   regext-login-security-policy.

   Level of maturity: Development

   Coverage: All aspects of the protocol are implemented.

7.  Security Considerations

   The mapping extensions described in this document provide additional
   security services beyond those described by EPP [RFC5730] and
   protocol layers used by EPP.  The security considerations described
   in these other specifications apply to this specification as well.

   This mapping does define the login security policy of the server,
   where there are security considerations with defining the policy,
   which include:

   1.  The server SHOULD follow login password complexity best
       practices, such as the NIST Special Publication 800-63B [2].
   2.  The server MAY have a login password expiry that requires the
       client to regularly change the login password.
   3.  The server SHOULD inform the client of the expiry of the login
       password.
   4.  The server MUST store the login password at rest securely, such
       as hashing or encrypting the login password.
   5.  The server SHOULD deprecate and eliminate insecure ciphers and
       protocols.
   6.  The server SHOULD inform the client of the use of insecure
       ciphers and protocols.
   7.  The server SHOULD inform the client of an expiring client
       certificate.

8.  Acknowledgements

   TBD

Appendix A.  Change History

A.1.  Change from 00 to 01

   1.  Changed the <loginSecPolicy:exError> element to the
       <loginSecPolicy:errorAction> element, to be more generic to
       identify the action taken for an error level event for any event
       type.  The XML namespace was changed to
       "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:loginSecPolicy-0.3" based on the
       change to the XML schema.
   2.  Updated the Implementation Status section.

A.2.  Change from 01 to 02

   1.  Fix the inconsistent case for newPW, that required a global
       change in the draft text and an update to the XML schema to
       "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:loginSecPolicy-0.3".
