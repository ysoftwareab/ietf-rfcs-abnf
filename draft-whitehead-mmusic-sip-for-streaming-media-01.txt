Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media               June 2006


1.  Introduction

   IP-based networks are continually improving in terms of bandwidth
   capacity and transport quality of service.  At the same time,
   broadband services are continually expanding globally -- both in
   terms of reach and value-added.  These developments are leading to an
   increase in the number and variety of deployment scenarios for
   streaming media applications.  Many of these scenarios impose
   challenging new requirements on the signaling protocols used for
   these applications in terms of flexibility, scalability and network
   independence.

   Historically, RTSP [3] and [4] has been the protocol of choice for
   streaming media applications and has covered both session control and
   media control.  An obvious approach to address these new requirements
   then is to extend RTSP.  This strategy appears to be able to address
   some of the new requirements, but not others.  In particular
   extending RTSP to meet some of these new requirements would involve
   introducing protocol mechanisms that already exist elsewhere, namely
   in SIP and its associated extensions.

   An alternative approach is to consider the possibility of using SIP
   for some of the functions needed by streaming media applications.
   While historically SIP has been used for communication services, the
   protocol itself is flexible enough (by design) to signal a wide
   variety of media streams.  Moreover, driven in large part by the
   requirements associated with IP-based communication services, SIP has
   been extended over the years to address many of the same requirements
   currently facing next-generation media streaming applications.
   Rather than reinvent or duplicate protocol mechanisms in RTSP that
   already exist in SIP, a reasonable strategy may be to find a way to
   use SIP instead or in conjunction with RTSP.

   This document presents some of the use cases that suggest a
   convergence between SIP and RTSP.  These will also be eventually used
   to derive requirements on the service signaling protocol.  Then,
   high-level strategies will be defined.

   The goal of the draft is not propose all SIP or SIP/RTSP solutions
   but to considers possible ways in which RTSP is not sufficient for
   some streaming media applications and where SIP could fill the gap.
   The purpose of the document is to give a list of use-cases (section
   3), a list of derived capabilities (section 4)", a rationale for
   considering SIP in conjunction with RTSP (section 5), and
   recommendations for future work (section 6).  The technical solution
   options may be investigated in a future draft based on the current
   document.

   ...others to be added when necessary...


3.  Use Case Scenarios

   The scope of applications for this document includes applications
   with the following characteristics: content-on-demand, streaming
   media, unicast-media streams, live or recorded content, ubiquitous
   access (any-device, any-access).

   While of interest, non-streaming media applications, such as
   downloaded media services, are outside the scope of this document.

3.1.  Characteristics

   For the purposes of this document, the term 'controlled streaming
   media application' represents the class of applications with the
   following characteristics:
   o  multiple servers that can be a source of content but showing up as
      a single muxed stream at the client
   o  one or more clients can receive the content
   o  the media stream(s) needs to be delivered isochronously, in the
      most common case: the client intends to begin rendering the media
      before delivery is complete
   o  less common but equally valid, the server does not have resources
      to buffer content until the client is ready to receive it, e.g., a
      live feed
   o  a session exists between source (e.g. server or peer) and
      destination (e.g. client or peer)
   o  the session is established, managed, and terminated through the
      use of a signaling protocol, in which control messages are
      exchanged (either directly or indirectly) between the source and
      the destination referred to as 'session signaling'
   o  the application supports media stream control.

   The client (or a proxy element acting on behalf of the client(s)) has
   the ability to manipulate the media stream (or other aspect of the
   application) via a signaling.  This is referred to as application-

Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media               June 2006


   signaling (or media control signaling).

3.2.  Use Cases Descriptions

   As IP-based broadband data services have continued to develop and
   expand, opportunities for streaming media applications have also
   proliferated and expanded beyond the traditional framework.  This
   section describes several streaming media application use case
   scenarios.  These scenarios illustrate the variety of conditions and
   environments in which streaming media applications need to operate.

   Use cases are used with the purpose of clarifying the 'streaming
   media application' and to explore the application space.  The
   objectives are to:
   o  clarify the frame / scope the discussion
   o  illustrate some of usage scenarios
   o  identify some of the key attributes that characterize these use
      cases

   These use-cases will clearly show that most of the time the choice is
   not SIP or RTSP but that the advantages of more integration lead to
   more robust solutions.  The use cases also show that that the session
   setup negotiations are usually independent of the media controls.

   Hence in many of the use cases SIP could be used to replace the RTSP
   SETUP and DESCRIBE methods, leaving RTSP to be used for media control
   only.

3.2.1.  Video Surveillance

   This is the first of a number of use cases that relate to
   "conversational video".  In this use case a user wants:
   o  either to switch from the unidirectional audio-video monitoring
      session into a 2-way (bi-directional) conversation when wanting to
      interact with an unknown visitor.  In this case the session is
      "upgraded" from one-way to two-way.
   o  or to switch from the unidirectional "live" received content to a
      unidirectional "recorded" content with a rewind "play trick
      command"

   Instead of RTSP, SIP can be used to setup the communication, which
   provides the ability to switch from the one-way monitoring
   communication to the bidirectional communication.  RTSP features
   related to trick plays can be used to remotely interact on the
   stream.  For example the remote viewer should be able to place a
   rewind command to the previously recorded content.  This is one use
   case for the convergence of both protocols.

Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media               June 2006


3.2.2.  Blended services/videoconferencing

   In this use case, the user wants to switch between a "bidirectional"
   live conversation to a "unidirectional" recorded content.  This use
   case is also for multiple services (streaming/communications/info) to
   use common signaling infrastructure.  In this case SIP is again used
   for authentication billing and location.  RTSP allows the remote
   viewer/user to place a "trick mode" rewind into a command
   videoconferencing context (to see what happened before joining in).

3.2.3.  Sharing a video with another person over a multi-media call

   This is another "conversational video" use case.  A user already in
   an audio-video conversation (using a SIP based protocol) wants to
   provide local audio-video content to the called party.  If the remote
   user wants to watch the live content (you should see what I am
   witnessing now) or request the content (can I look at the game you
   recorded yesterday?), a lot of the communication setup, generally
   established by RTSP, can be avoided with SIP the relationship
   (including authentication and billing) between the two parties is
   already established.  This use case does not mean that the
   bidirectional "conversational" are switched to unidirectional
   "recorded" streams, but that "recorded" streams are to be added to
   the "conversational" streams.

3.2.4.  Allow access to personal/private video content

   In this scenario a user wants to remotely access personal content
   stored on a variety of media devices (watch at pre-recorded show from
   a mobile device at work).  While the streaming of the content and the
   trick plays will use established RTSP functionality the use of SIP
   locator services, strong authentication and authorization as well as
   presence make this solution more feasible.  For example, if the
   content is stored on a device located on a private network behind a
   FW/NAT, SIP via its name/location registration mecanism can be used
   to locate and connect to the device.  In addition for this use-case,
   the access to a video content should make "session mobility"
   possible.  In other words, when viewing a video content, it should be
   possible for the session of a user to seamlessly switch from one
   terminal (e.g.: mobile phone) to another one (e.g.: television).

3.2.5.  VOD services that requires resource or QOS-guarantees

   Consider a Video on Demand (stored video) service provided as a
   unicast session to an end user device from a server.  The user
   requests a VOD movie.  The VOD server determines the video that user
   wants to watch, and then contacts the appropriate network element
   (NE) and requests to reserve resources for the user and confirm back

Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media               June 2006


   to the server.  The problem is here that until this point, the NE can
   not fully estimate and negotiate the media resources needed for the
   whole duration of the VOD.  SIP has pre-conditions that could be
   used; RTSP has no such functionality.

3.2.6.  Settlement across provider boundaries

   If a commercial VOD service is being offered by one party (e.g. a
   service provider) but receives carriage (transport) by one or more
   other parties (network providers) a mechanism is needed to allow
   service signaling to exchange transaction identifiers for the purpose
   of charge correlation and settlements.  SIP (and its associated
   extensions) supports these capabilities.  RTSP at present does not.

3.2.7.  Intelligent selection of media encoding

   A user orders content to be delivered to its current device the
   content could exist in different format (e.g. standard definition or
   high definition) or encoding (MPEG2 or MPEG4 for example).  Media
   negociations may need to be informed by network transport
   capabilities.  This is based on knowledge of access-network type.

4.  Required capabilities/Derived Requirements

   This section lists key requirements derived from the application use
   cases described in the previous section.  The requirements are
   described in terms of the capabilities provided by a prospective
   solution.

4.1.  Scalability

   Any solution must be able to accommodate:
   o  Millions of clients and servers
   o  An individual server may need to support thousands of parallel
      sessions.
   o  An individual client may need to support a number of simultaneous
      sessions

4.2.  Signaling Latency

   Because the use cases refer to live content the latency budget is
   important for the user experience.  Thus, the solution must support
   the following requirements





S. Whitehead, et al.    Expires December 23, 2006               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media               June 2006


   o  The session negotiation should complete in a few seconds at most
      (TBC: need confirmation).
   o  The media control operations should complete is less than a second
      (TBC: need confirmation).

4.3.  User identification, authentication and authorization

   In many targeted personal video streaming solution (including peer to
   peer) there is still a need for identifying source and destination,
   authenticate users and authorize access.

4.4.  Accounting, charging, and settlements

   In the case of commercial applications billing aspects need to be
   addressed.  Billing aspects must also provide mechanisms to suppport
   charging correlation and settlements between one or more parties that
   collaborate to deliver the service.

4.5.  Server/client Location Discovery

   Location and discovery of the end point of a session is essential for
   personalization and targeted services.

4.6.  NAT and Firewall Traversal

   The solution must provide a way to traverse NATs and Firewalls.  For
   example, when switching from a remote monitoring communication to a
   conversational communication, the NATs bindings should not be
   renegotiated.

4.7.  Session-based transport policy control

   The signaling mechanism should provide a means to insure that
   sufficient network resources are available to deliver the service at
   the desired quality of experience.  In the event that sufficient
   resources are unavailable, the signaling mecanism should provide a
   means for denying the service request.

4.8.  Extensible with respect to application control signaling

   (Support many different application types)

   ...words to be added...

4.9.  Support media negotiation

   The solution must provide a way to negotiate all media sessions
   (e.g.: conversational and streaming) as a whole, as described in the

Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media               June 2006


   RFC3264 with the offer/answer so that both parties can estimate the
   media resources involved in the session.

4.10.  Allow proxies

4.11.  Support media negotiation

   The signaling protocol should support the following capabilities with
   respect to negotiating media flows:
   o  Support for negotiating per-flow/media QoS and bandwidth
      requirements.
   o  Ability to add, delete, and modify media flows to a session.
   o  Ability to support both uni-directional an bi-directional flows in
      a single session.

4.12.  Support auto-configuration/installation

   ...words to be added...

4.13.  Keeping DRM rights during the mobility session

   ...words to be added...


5.  Rationale for using SIP and RSTP for streaming application

   The set of use cases outlined above present a compelling argument for
   considering SIP for establishing "conversational video"
   communications or for those sessions potentially becoming
   conversations.  SIP also supports a rich set of capabilities that are
   useful in the context of commercial streaming media applications.  In
   particular, SIP has the following properties that can be leveraged of
   in streaming sessions:
   o  SIP acts as a rendezvous protocol (with many capabilities)
   o  SIP carries the session description protocol
   o  SIP supports invitation to unicast or multicast sessions
   o  SIP supports SDP with the Offer/Answer Model
   o  SIP works with NAT via ICE for SIP
   o  SIP supports unidirectional and bidirectional communications e.g.,
      can switch to 2-way or mix with streaming services
   o  SIP supports a set of P-headers useful in the context of
      commercial service settings, for example:
      *  charging-ids : useful for 3rd party content providers
      *  access-network headers: useful for inferring proper content
         encoding

   We support the use of RTSP for controlling the playback of media
   flows such as the delivery of webcam monitoring content, the delivery

Internet-Draft           SIP for Streaming Media               June 2006


   of Video on Demand and the delivery of IPTV.  RTSP as defined in [3]
   has the following properties that are important to build on:
   o  RTSP acts as a lightweight rendezvous protocol
   o  RTSP supports trick plays and media control
      (pause/rewind/forward/...)
   o  RTSP carries and interprets the session description protocol
   o  RTSP supports invitation to unicast or multicast sessions
   o  RTSP is a recognized standard for streaming applications

   There are obvious overlaps and more work is needed to assess how the
   two protocols can be made to better interwork without major
   disruptions to existing applications.


6.  Recommendations

   We propose that further work be initiated to explorer how to signal
   streaming media sessions using SIP based on the use cases defined in
   this document.  We propose to reuse RTSP as a control stream
   negotiated by SIP/SDP.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The RTSP 'encoding format' and the new media attributes may need to
   be registered.


8.  Security Considerations

   No rogue 3rd party should be allowed to get the token and use it to
   setup an un-authorized RTSP session.
