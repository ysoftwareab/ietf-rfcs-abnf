         Resource Pooling Mechanism for Multi-Layer Operations
                draft-iijima-resource-pool-multilayer-00

Abstract

   This memo proposes resource pooling mechanism for multi-layer
   operations.  Resource pool is often discussed in the context of
   robustness and restoration.  But, resource pooling mechanism should
   also be used for realizing flexibility in multi-layer network
   operations.  Today, it takes days or weeks of lead time to change
   wide area networks composed of multiple network layers.  One of the
   reasons is because communications between operators of different
   network layers are necessary before configuration of each layer is
   made.  A network management system that uses resource pooling
   mechanism would get rid of communications made between operators of
   different network layers, and would realize flexible changes in
   multi-layer networks.

1.  Introduction

   This memo proposes resource pooling mechanism for multi-layer network
   operations.  Resource pool is often discussed in the context of
   robustness and restoration.  But, resource pooling mechanism should
   also be used for realizing flexibility in multi-layer network
   operations.  Today, it takes days or weeks of lead time to change
   wide area networks composed of multiple network layers.  One of the
   reasons is because communications between operators of different
   network layers are necessary before configuration of each network
   layer is made.  A network management system that adopts resource
   pooling mechanism would get rid of communications made between
   operators of different network layers, and would realize flexible
   changes in multi-layer networks.

2.  Problem Statement

   In general, wide area networks are composed of multiple network
   layers.  For example, core of the carrier networks are made up of WDM
   (Wavelength-Division Multiplexing) devices.  And, transport devices
   such as SONET/SDH (Synchronous Optical Network / Synchronous Digital
   Hierarchy) are surrounding them and providing reliability.
   Furthermore, IP devices such as routers and switches are deployed
   around these devices in order to accommodate users' traffic.

   Today, each network layer is managed independently by different
   management systems or different operators.  Thus, when there is a
   need to change wide area networks according to a user demand or
   traffic pattern, operators of each network layer need to communicate
   with each other.  This takes large lead time.  In the era when a user
   sporadically requires large bandwidth, such a long lead time in
   changing networks is not acceptable.

   In order to reduce lead time and to realize flexibility in changing
   wide area networks, this memo proposes using resource pooling
   mechanism for multi-layer operations.  By specifying resource pooling
   mechanism and by developing a network management system that uses the
   mechanism, communications made now between operators of different
   network layers would be done away with.

3.  Use Case of Resource Pool

   As an example of introducing resource pooling mechanism, this memo
   describes a case when MPLS-TP layer provides resource pool for IP
   layer.  MPLS-TP (Multi Protocol Label Switching - Transport Profile)
   is a transport protocol that would replace SONET/SDH in wide area
   networks.

   In the case when MPLS-TP provides resource pool, the resource would
   be LSP (Label Switched Path) or pseudo wire.  These resources are
   able to provide reliable end-to-end connection with guaranteed
   bandwidth.

   Currently, LSPs and pseudo wires are established according to the
   contract between users and operators of wide area networks.  And the
   connection is used exclusively for one user once established.
   However, the bandwidth of this connection is not always used fully.
   Most of the bandwidth is left unused at some point in time.  Under
   such a circumstance, these LSPs and pseudo wires should be managed as
   resource pool and assigned flexibly to other users who are accessing
   through IP layers.

   When a user demands an end-to-end connection with guaranteed
   bandwidth at certain time, a network management system adopting
   resource pooling mechanism finds out an already established but
   unused LSP and pseudo wire from MPLS-TP layer and assigns it to the
   user who are accessing through IP layer.

   This assignment mechanism is illustrated in generalized form at
   Figure 1.  In order to assign resource of lower network layer to
   upper network layer, the status of the resource in lower network
   layer should be managed at network management system.  And, the
   network management system should assign resource to upper network
   layer by matching the attributes of resource and topology
   information.  The attributes of resource managed at the network
   management system should be defined, and this memo propose these in
   the next section.  Based on the result of assignment, then the
   management system configures upper network layer accordingly.

4.  Attributes of Resource Pool

   The basic attributes of resource should be defined as follows.

   o  Identifier

   o  Network Layer (HO-ODU, LO-ODU, LSP, pseudo wire, etc.)

   o  QoS Level

   o  Bandwidth

   o  Source Point

      *  Node ID

      *  Port ID

   o  Destination Point

      *  Node ID

      *  Port ID

   o  Status (Unused, Used, Working, Error)

   These attributes should be retrieved from lower network layer and
   held at network management system.  Attributes such as Node ID and
   Port ID should be used with topology information when the network
   management system associates resource in lower network layer to a
   traffic in upper network layer.

6.  Security Considerations

   The attributes about resource are confidential information.  Thus,
   they need to be transported in a confidential manner.
