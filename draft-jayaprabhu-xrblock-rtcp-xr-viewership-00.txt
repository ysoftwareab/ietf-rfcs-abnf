INTERNET DRAFT  Viewership Report Block Type for RTCP XR   December 2013


1  Introduction

   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is the out-of-band control protocol
   for applications that use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for
   media transport [RFC3550].  In addition to providing minimal control
   functionality to RTP entities, RTCP also enables a basic-level
   monitoring of RTP sessions via sender and receiver reports.  More
   statistically detailed monitoring as well as application-specific
   monitoring are usually achieved through the RTCP Extended Reports
   (XRs) [RFC3611].

   As the number of IPTV deployments continue to increase, it becomes
   necessary for the operator to collect various information on the
   streams that are being delivered to the user. This document defines a
   new report block type for the Extended Report (XR) packet type of the
   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) which allows IPTV clients to report to a
   server on the usage pattern of the stream that is being delivered to
   them. For example the RTP data received by them may be used for
   viewing purpose and/or recording purpose.

   The new block type defined in this document is the Viewership report
   block. The data reported by a client is intended to be useful in
   understanding the usage pattern of a particular client over time and
   also can collect detailed information on how many users used a
   particular stream and for what purpose. 


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Viewership Report Block

   This section defines the format of the viewership report block. The
   packet format for the RTCP XR is defined in Section 2 of [RFC3611]. 
   Each XR packet has a fixed-length field for version, padding,
   reserved bits, payload type (PT), length, synchronization source
   (SSRC) of packet sender as well as a variable-length field for report
   blocks.  In the XR packets, the PT field is set to XR (207).

   The viewership report block is only sent as a part of an RTCP
   compound packet, and it is sent in the primary multicast session.

   Following the rules specified in [RFC3550], all integer fields in the
   base report and extensions defined below are carried in network-byte

   order, that is, most significant byte (octet) first, also known as
   big-endian.  Unless otherwise stated, numeric constants are in
   decimal (base 10). The report format is shown in Figure 1.

             Figure 1: Format for the Viewership Report Block


      o  block type (BT): 8 bits

         A Viewership Report Block is identified by the constant TVM.

      o  version(ver=0): 4 bits

         The currently defined version is 0

      o  resd: 4 bits

         This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence  
         of such definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero 
         and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

      o  block length: 16 bits

         The length of this report block, including the header, in 32-  
         bit words minus one. The block length is equal to 3 for the    
         viewership report block. The block MUST be discarded if the    
         block length is set to a different value.

      o  SSRC of the Primary Stream: 32 bits

         The SSRC of the RTP data packet source being reported upon by  
         this report block.

      o  time watched (cumulative) - seconds: 31 bits

         This field denotes how much time was spent watching the primary
         session. This is a cumulative counter expressed in seconds.    
         The receiver should keep track of this value using a local     
         representation as this will wrap beyond (2^31 - 1) seconds

      o  time recorded (cumulative) - seconds: 31 bits

         This field denotes how much time was spent recording the       
         primary session. This is a cumulative counter expressed in     
         seconds. The receiver should keep track of this value using a  
         local representation as this will wrap beyond (2^31 - 1)       
         seconds

      o  Viewing flag (V): 1 bit

         This field should be set to "1" in case if there were "any"    
         seconds during RTCP reporting interval, if the primary session 
         was used for watching i.e. if "time watched" field increased   
         during this interval and "0" otherwise.

      o  Recording flag (R): 1 bit

         This field should be set to "1" in case if there were "any"    
         seconds during RTCP reporting interval, if the primary session 
         was used for recording i.e. if "time recorded" field increased 
         during this interval and "0" otherwise. 


3  Session Description Protocol Signaling

   This session augments the SDP attribute "rtcp-xr" defined in Section
   5.1 of RFC 3611 by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document. The ABNF
   [RFC5234] syntax is as follows.

      xr-format =/  vqe-viewership

      vqe-viewership = "vqe-viewership"


4  Security Considerations

   The new RTCP XR blocks in this document do not introduce any new
   security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].


5  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to RFC
   3611. The contact information for the registrations is:
