1.  Introduction

   In the interconnected CDNs context where CDNs are organized into a
   hierarchy, an upstream CDN (uCDN) that is not able to deliver the
   requested content, may need to delegate the delivery to a downstream
   CDN (dCDN).  When end-users' connections are transported over TLS,
   this delivery delegation involves security requirements such as:

   o  Ensuring the trusted delegation of the delivery of contents hosted
      by a uCDN to the downstream CDN (dCDN), i.e., that uCDN has
      wilfully designated the uCDN to deliver the content, thus ensuring
      the delegation is legitimate.

   o  Ensuring a seamless security scheme when redirecting users'
      requests from a uCDN to a dCDN, i.e., the certificates received by
      the browser are valid and are tied to the domain for which the
      delegation occurs.  For instance, an User Agent (UA) might request
      a piece of content from a upstream CDN (uCDN), and if the uCDN
      cannot serve the content, it may redirect the request to a
      downstream CDN (dCDN).  Because the uCDN shall trust in that case
      the dCDN to deliver the content, this delegation should ideally
      not trigger a security warning in the user's browser.

   o  Guaranteeing the confidentiality of CDNs configuration and
      topology information, i.e. keep this information hidden from each
      CDNs, and from the end-user browser.  As an example, the end-user
      shall not be aware of the CDNI topology.

   A brief survey indicates that there is a multitude of ad hoc
   approaches for handling TLS-based traffic in CDN environment.
   However, many of the currently adopted practices seem to have
   problems of various nature, inhibiting and compromising security,
   scalability, and ease of operation and maintenance (see e.g.
   [HTTPS-CDN] and [SSL-Challenges]).

   This document is intended as a starting point for discussion.  It
   shall review redirection methods introduced in [RFC3568] used in the
   Interconnected CDNs use case, their impacts on the security of
   delegation, and the implications of redirection in a secured web
   environment.  It eventually identifies some workarounds, or solutions
   to the raised issues.

   o  HTTP-based redirection methods: 3xx, URL rewriting, API based

   o  DNS-layer redirection

2.  Problem Scope

   In a secured CDN interconnection model where aCDN and a dCDN have two
   distinct domains, the User Agent (UA) tries first to resolve the uCDN
   domain when it contacts the uCDN for a piece of content.  At this
   step, two types of redirection methods can be considered, both
   delegating the content delivery to the dCDN:

   o  using DNS routing, the UA is redirected to the dCDN, e.g., with a
      CNAME sent by the uCDN authoritative DNS server.

   o  the UA is redirected by the uCDN to the dCDN using a HTTP-based
      mechanism: Once the uCDN domain is resolved, the UA negotiates a
      secured connection to the uCDN for that content, and receives the
      uCDN certificate.  Then the uCDN subsequently uses an HTTP
      redirection method to redirect the UA to a dCDN surrogate content
      server.

   Then, the UA resolves dCDN domain name, and then negotiates a new
   secured connection with the dCDN, retrieving the dCDN certificate.
   If the certificate is valid, then the UA will be able to connect to
   the dCDN surrogate, and the dCDN will deliver the requested piece of
   content to the UA.

   Both cases raises security issues in a CDNI environment:

   o  How to ensuring that the delegation is legitimate?  In DNS, this
      cannot be ensured without additional cryptographic measures (see
      DNS redirection related section) contrary to HTTPS, refer to HTTP-
      based redirection methods section for more details.

   o  How to ensure that certificates received by the browser are valid
      and are tied to the domain for which the delegation occurs?  This
      is may not be the case if uCDN and dCDN don't share the same
      domain name, see related [redirection methods] section and [TLS
      API] section for more details.

   o  How to guarantee the confidentiality of CDNs configuration and
      topology information?  The UA may be able to discover the CDNI
      topology which is not secure.  Please refer to []Topology hiding]
      section for more details.

3.  HTTP-based redirection methods

   This section deals with HTTP-based redirection methods for secured
   TLS connections in CDNI.

3.1.  3xx directives

   When dealing with redirection over HTTP/S, two sub-cases should be
   considered:

   o  HTTP -> HTTPS: In this case, the CSP / uCDN from domain A
      redirects end-users' HTTP requests to the dCDN from domain B, and
      upgrades the security scheme to HTTPS.

   o  HTTPS -> HTTPS: In this case, the CSP / uCDN domain A redirects
      the browsers' request to dCDN domain B.

   Regardless of DNS resolution aspects, in the first sub-case, the
   initial delegation will not be secured, or trusted: the end user will
   have no cryptographic assurance that the uCDN is delegating to that
   dCDN, even though the user may subsequently form a secure connection
   to the dCDN.  The HTTPS upgrade should always be accepted
   automatically by the browser, on the condition that the certificate
   is valid and trusted (e.g., not self-signed).

   In the second sub-case, TLS set-up happens before the first HTTP
   request is sent, therefore, the subsequent traffic including request
   URI and query parameters will be encrypted.  First, the TLS session
   is established between the UA and the origin uCDN, authenticating the
   uCDN.  Then, the uCDN uses HTTP mechanisms for redirection, using 3xx
   messages like 302 Found, embedding the new target URI aiming at the
   CDN surrogate in the Location header.  UA then sets up a separate TLS



Fieau, et al.            Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          HTTPS delivery delegation           October 2015


   session with the dCDN surrogate, validating the dCDN certificate.
   Trust relationship is implied since the redirection message has been
   received over the authenticated TLS tunnel with the origin uCN.

   The delegation is trusted and legitimate even if two independent TLS
   sessions will have to be set up in sequence by the UA.  The trust
   delegation endorsement, tying two sessions together is realized by
   the fact that the target URI has been communicated in the redirection
   message by the authenticated origin uCDN over the encrypted tunnel.

   However the issue here is when both uCDN and dCDN domains are
   distinct.  Indeed, the browser has received two certificates linked
   to two distinct domains.  Therefore, the browser can't seamlessly
   assure the end-user that delegation has occurred on the same domain.
   While browser implementation determines how transparent the
   delegation may be to an end user, the browser may in most of the
   cases generate a warning message notifying the user of a secure
   domain change, which is not a seamless delegation.

   However, mainstream browser implementations support seamless secure
   redirection via HTTP 3xx responses.  Ultimately, the secure
   delegation from a uCDN to a dCDN is entirely tractable in the HTTPS
   environment provided that application layer redirection such as HTTP
   3xx responses is used.

3.2.  URL Rewriting

   URL rewriting is a method to compute in a web page destination URLs
   to point at new web location while this page is rendered on the
   browser.  This modification could be typically caused by a script
   embedded in the page.  Alternatively, a server-side code could modify
   embedded URLs before the page is retrieved by a browser, including
   certain classes of web intermediaries.  URL rewriting can therefore
   serves as a form of application-layer redirection.

   Regarding CDNI, a page served over TLS by an uCDN will prevent
   intermediaries from modifying URLs without the consent of the user or
   the uCDN.  Client-side scripts pushed by the uCDN will still be
   secure, and then the redirection to any dCDNs via rewriting would be
   secure as well.

3.2.1.  URL Rewriting for Video Contents

   In the case of HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) techniques where
   contents are chunked in order to be played with multiple video
   qualities, a manifest file will describe the way the content was
   prepared/encoded, e.g. how many qualities, chunks size, and their




Fieau, et al.            Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          HTTPS delivery delegation           October 2015


   network location.  This manifest is requested by the player prior to
   any chunks.

   Regarding CDNI, if the manifest is available on the uCDN domain A,
   while video chunks are available on the dCDN domain B, the player
   requesting for chunks will be redirected by the uCDN to the dCDN
   using 3xx redirection methods (see the previous section), thus
   ensuring a trusted delegation but not seamless for the end-user.

   In another more complex case, both the uCDN and the dCDN may deliver
   some of the video chunks.

3.3.  API Mode, or scripted redirection (e.g. via AJAX requests, JSONP,
      etc.)

   In the API mode, a web page requested by the browser contains a
   script that "transparently" - from the user's perspective - requests
   contents on another web page.

   As far as CDNI is concerned, the initial web page and scripts would
   be located on domain A, whereas contents requested by the script
   would be located on a secondary domain B.

   Apart from "cross-domain" (CORS) issues that can be fixed with an
   "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header, this use case raises also the
   HTTPS certificate issues likewise in other HTTP-based redirection
   cases.

4.  DNS redirection

   In the case of DNS-based redirection, prior to any HTTP delivery
   requests, the UA tries to resolve the uCDN domain, then uCDN DNS
   server answers with the dCDN domain name (e.g., using a CNAME)
   instead of the uCDN domain, thus realizing the DNS redirection to the
   dCDN.

   In that case, the actual redirect happens before the establishment of
   the TLS tunnel.  The issue here is that the user UA expects the
   uCDN's certificate, but instead obtains the dCDN surrogate's
   certificate during the TLS handshake.  Mismatch between the expected
   origin uCDN URI and the received dCDN URI designated in the obtained
   certificate causes certificate validation warnings at the UA.
   Eventually a client UA displays a warning to the end user requiring
   additional steps, which compromises the seamless delegation.

   The CDNI Redirection draft ([I-D.ietf-cdni-redirection]) specifies
   that in addition to HTTP, DNS redirection can be used as a means of
   delegation from a uCDN to a dCDN.  In this case, the DNS resolver,



Fieau, et al.            Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          HTTPS delivery delegation           October 2015


   when it queries for the hostname associated with the uCDN URL, will
   be served a DNS response (such as CNAME) that will direct the client
   to the dCDN.  However, in an HTTPS environment, this will result in
   the client containing a domain other than the one originally
   specified by the URL input by the end user.  Consequently, this will
   result in a security failure when the browser attempts to negotiate
   TLS with the web server it contacts, as the change in domain name
   will be indistinguishable from a malicious attacker.

   Another security issue wider than CDNI scope, related to the "HARD
   problem" draft [I-D.barnes-hard-problem] ("High Assurance Re-
   Direction") is where a malicious DNS resolver could return DNS
   responses (IP addresses/CNAMEs) that steer the User Agent to a
   malicious server.  DNS response hijacking could be used to mount a
   DoS attack against the CDN/Content Provider as the User Agent won't
   be able to receive the content that it wants because it is being told
   to retrieve it from a server that it can't establish a TLS session
   to.

   DNSSEC would prevent that because responses would need to be signed
   and a malicious DNS resolver would therefore not be able to return
   malicious responses as it would not be able to generate properly
   signed DNS response.

4.1.  a DNSSEC-based approach

   DNSSEC makes it possible to secure DNS redirections.  Were CDNI to
   use DNSSEC for DNS based redirection, the client's resolver would
   have a strong assurance that the uCDN had in fact designated the dCDN
   as its delegate.  However, DNSSEC adoption remains patchy, and
   consequently this may not be a practicable solution in the immediate
   future.  While technologies like DANE which build on DNSSEC could
   help, they remain dependent on DNSSEC adoption.

   Such an approach is proposed in [HTTPS-CDN] for the DANE-based
   [RFC6698] front-end authentication using the DNS-based redirection.
   We reproduce a brief overview of the proposal from [HTTPS-CDN] here
   as an example of a possible approach.

   Using DANE, an origin CSP binds target CDN's certificate with the
   CSP's own certificate and domain name (see section VI.  B. of [HTTPS-
   CDN]) by adding both certificates to the CSP's TLSA record [RFC6698].
   After initiating a TLS connection to target CDN surrogate, and having
   received CDN's certificate, the UA further issues a DNS query to
   request origin CSP's TLSA records.  UA then is capable of validating
   both URIs and Certificates with those received in the TLSA record,
   explicitly ensuring the delegation of trust.

5.  Enforcing trust delegation: CDNI URI Signing

   CDNI URI Signing [I-D.leung-cdni-uri-signing] draft specifies a
   detailed mechanism to ensure validation of parameters communicated in
   the redirection URI.

   Considering CDNI and HTTPS delegation, this URI signing mechanism
   could be used as means to enforce trust delegation.

   While this later draft focuses on the validation by the target CDN of
   the authenticity of the parameters communicated in the redirect URI
   generated by the origin CSP, CDNI URI Signing could be extended or
   used to include the certificate information or hashes either in the
   provided URI Signing Package Attribute, or in an additional Package
   Attribute (e.g.  Redirect Authentication Attribute), reusing much of
   the mechanisms detailed in the draft.

6.  Topology hiding

   A further security concern associated with redirection is the
   question of how much information a uCDN imparts to the browser, and
   consequently to the end user, about its policy decisions in
   delegating to a dCDN.  However, in order to preserve crucial security
   properties, it is likely unavoidable that a certain amount of
   information will be divulged to any browser or client of a CDN
   system.  For example, consider that eventually, content will be
   downloaded from a dCDN cache at a particular IP address, and that
   consequently, information about a responsible network will always be
   revealed to an end user.

   The guidance in [I-D.ietf-cdni-redirection] Section 5 considers the
   possibility of using "probes" of this form, and the potential
   topology leakage of any redirection interface.

7.  TLS API for third-party

   Delegating delivery of HTTPS traffic to a third party without
   triggering any warnings on the client's browser can be achieved if
   the dCDN surrogate is able to present the security credentials for
   the domain name in the user's initial request.  One of the common
   practices so far has been for the content provider to directly
   delegate the storage of the private keys to the CDN that is
   delivering the content on its behalf.  This solution could persist in
   the CDNI context, but in a scenario where delivery is done through
   multiple cascaded dCDN, it becomes unlikely that the content provider
   would be willing to share its private keys with all the parties
   involved.

   Another solution is the introduction of a Private Key Server in the
   TLS handshake.  Such solutions are commercially deployed and several
   examples are made publicly available.  Such a setup allows the
   private keys to remain under the authority of the content owner (or
   the uCDN) while the actual content can be served from a dCDN
   surrogate that is closer to the end user.  Indeed, the architecture

   introduces a split in the setup of the secure tunnel between the
   client's browser and the surrogate delivering the content.  Since the
   dCDN does not possess the private keys for the requested domain name,
   during the setup of the TLS tunnel between the client and the dCDN
   surrogate, the latter forwards the challenge to the Private Key
   Server which is under the control of the content owner (or the uCDN).
   With the response it receives, the surrogate is able to successfully
   establish a secure connection to the end user and serve the requested
   content without triggering any warnings in the client's browser.

   o  The user agent connects to the CDN surrogate.  The client sends a
      secret encrypted with the site's public key for the surrogate to
      decrypt.

   o  The surrogate contacts the key server, authenticating itself with
      a certificate.  The surrogate sends the encrypted secret to the
      key server to decrypt it.  The key server returns the decrypted
      secret to the dCDN surrogate over a secure tunnel.

   o  Both client and surrogate use the shared secret to establish a
      secure connection.  The user agent issues its request for content
      over HTTPS.

   o  The surrogate then processes the original request.

   Below is an example of the handshake establishment:
