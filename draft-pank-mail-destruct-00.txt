Abstract

   As e-mail use is becoming more prevalent and the applications of  its
   use  more  diverse  it is increasingly becoming a burden to users and
   system administration staff to maintain message stores and "weed-out"
   obsolete  messages.   The  problem  also manifests itself as a direct
   cost to organisations trying to maintain storage space  for  user  e-
   mail  messages where a considerable proportion of messages are simply
   forgotten and lay dormant.

   RFC 822 defines a message representation protocol specifying  details
   about  US-ASCII  message  headers.   As an extension to this protocol
   this memo proposes the introduction of an additional header to enable
   e-mail messages to "self-destruct" after a specified period depending
   on a number of  conditions  that  may  have  been  specified  by  the
   originator  or  can  subsequently be (re-)specified by the recipient.
   This memo also proposes possible client  and  server  implementations
   with  a  view  of  soliciting  feedback  and  further refining of the
   extensions.

1. Introduction

   This memo defines a proposed  extension  to  RFC  822  specifying  an
   additional  header  to enable e-mail to "self-destruct".  On occasion
   messages are sent to individuals or groups that have a pre-determined
   shelf-life  due  to  their  nature  or  content.   The  functionality
   afforded by this extension would  enable  housekeeping  functions  on
   messaging  stores  to  identify  messages  with  obsolete  content by
   inspecting the self-destruct header to determine  if  a  message  has
   become "stale".

   The actions taken by the housekeeping function is  an  implementation
   issue and some possibilities are specified in section 4 - Server-side
   Implementation.

1.1 Intended operation

   To enable a message to self-destruct at least one parameter would  be
   required  specifying  either  an absolute date for destruction or the
   time period before destruction.  Using two  parameters  would  enable
   the  "destruct  'n'  days  after  reading"  feature,  see section 3 -
   Examples, for detailed information.

2. Extension Syntax

   A self-destruct header must be included with the message  header  for
   interpretation  by  the  destination mail server.  The header syntax,
   using Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as used in  RFC  822,  is  as
   follows


        self-destruct-header = "Self-Destruct" ":" destruct-spec

        destruct-spec  =
                   ( [destruct-timer]","
                     [(destruct-timer /  destruct-date)] ) /
                   ( [destruct-timer] / [destruct-date] )

        destruct-timer = 1*DIGIT   "d" /           ; no. of days
                         1*DIGIT   "w" /           ; no. of weeks
                         1*DIGIT   "m" /           ; no. of months
                         1*DIGIT   "y" /           ; no. of years

        destruct-date  = date                      ; absolute date

        date           = 1*2DIGIT month 4DIGIT     ; day month year
                                                   ; e.g. 19 Mar 1999

        month          = "Jan" / "Feb" / "Mar" / "Apr" / "May" / "Jun"
                       / "Jul" / "Aug" / "Sep" / "Oct" / "Nov" / "Dec"




3. Examples

   Self-Destruct information may be encoded in a number of ways;  either
   using  a  timer or an absolute destruct date.  The following examples
   show how this may be achieved.

     Self-Destruct: 3d                    / destruct in 3 days regardless
     Self-Destruct: 3d,                   / destruct 3 days after reading
     Self-Destruct: 7d,14d                / destruct 7 days after reading
                                          / or 14 days regardless
     Self-Destruct: Fri Mar 19 1999       / destruct on specified date
     Self-Destruct: 7d,Fri Mar 19 1999    / destruct 7 days after reading
                                          / or on specified date
4. Server-side Implementation

   This may be  implemented  in  a  number  of  ways;   either  using  a
   housekeeping  robot  that  inspects  messages  on a daily basis or by
   collecting and storing a destruction  information  log  each  time  a
   message  with  a "Self-Destruct" header is received which can then be
   used to provide an index to messages  that  may  have  expired.   The
   latter  may  be  more useful on mail servers that do not have an off-
   peak period where resource intensive robots cannot be used.

   Messages that have been marked for destruction can either be archived
   to  alternative  bulk storage media or to the users trashcan which in
   turn would be administered using implementation specific tools.

5. Client-side Implementation

   Client-side implementation is open  to  artistic  licence.   Messages
   that  are  due to expire can be displayed using display attributes or
   flagged if they are due to destruct within a specified period.

   GUI clients may be developed to display an  icon  alongside  messages
   that  are  flagged  for  destruction  together with a "progress" type
   indicator as a visual display indicating how far the message is  into
   it's shelf-life.

   It would also be possible for clients to issue a  delete  command  to
   the server if a message that has expired is encountered thus reducing
   the load on the server.  Using this method the server-side daemon may
   be required to run on a less frequent basis.
