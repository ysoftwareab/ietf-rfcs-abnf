INTERNET DRAFT       <Video LC Metrics for RTCP XR>    December 31, 2014


1  Introduction

   Multimedia applications often suffer from packet losses in IP
   networks. In order to get a reasonable degree of quality in case of
   packet losses, it is necessary to have loss concealment mechanisms at
   the decoder. Video loss concealment is a range of techniques to mask
   the effects of packet loss in video communications. 

   In some applications, reporting the information of receivers applying
   video loss concealment could give monitors or senders useful
   information on application QoE. One example is no-reference video
   quality evaluation. Video probes located upstream from the video
   endpoint or terminal may not see loss occurring between the probe and
   the endpoint, and may also not be fully aware of the specific loss
   concealment methods being dynamically applied by the video endpoint.
   Evaluating error concealment is important in the circumstance in
   estimating the subjective impact of impairments.  

   This draft defines one new video loss concealment block type to
   augment those defined in [RFC3611] and [i.d-ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-
   loss-concealment] for use in a range of RTP video applications. The
   metrics defined in this draft belong to the class of transport-
   related terminal metrics defined in [RFC6792].

1.1 RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550]. [RFC3611]
   defines an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR). This draft defines a new Extended Report block that MUST
   be used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.2 Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics. The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guidelines for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR. The XR block type described in this
   document are in accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390] and
   [RFC6792].

1.3 Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to video applications of RTP and the
   video component of Audio/Video applications in which packet loss
   concealment mechanisms are incorporated into the receiving endpoint
   to mitigate the impact of network impairments on QoE. For example, in
   an IPTV system Set Top Boxes could use this RTCP XR block to report
   loss and loss concealment metrics to an IPTV management system to
 


<Huang, et al.>           Expires July 4, 2015                  [Page 3]

INTERNET DRAFT       <Video LC Metrics for RTCP XR>    December 31, 2014


   enable the service provider to monitor the quality of the IPTV
   service being delivered to end users.

2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3  Video Loss Concealment Methods

   Video loss concealment mechanisms can be classified into 4 types as
   follow:

   a) Frame freeze

   The impaired video frame is not displayed, instead, the previously
   displayed frame is frozen for the duration of the loss event.

   b) Inter-frame extrapolation

   If an area of the video frame is damaged by loss, the same area from
   the previous frame(s) can be used to estimate what the missing pixels
   would have been. This can work well in a scene with no motion but can
   be very noticeable if there is significant movement from one frame to
   another. Simple decoders may simply re-use the pixels that were in
   the missing area while more complex decoders may try to use several
   frames to do a more complex extrapolation.

   c) Interpolation

   A decoder may user the undamaged pixels in the video frame to
   estimate what the missing block of pixels should have.

   d) Error Resilient Encoding

   The sender may encode the message in a redundant way so that receiver
   can correct errors using the redundant information. The redundant
   data useful for error resiliency performed at the decoder can be
   embedded into the compressed image/video bitstream. For example, the
   encoder may select an important area of an original video frame,
   extract some important characteristics of this area, e.g., motion
   vector of each macroblock, and imperceptibly embed them into other
   parts of the video frame. FEC is also another error resilient method.

   In this document, we differentiate between frame freeze and the other
   3 concealment mechanisms described.

4.  Video Loss Concealment Report Block

   This block reports the video loss concealment metrics to complement
   the audio metrics defined in [i.d-ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-loss-
   concealment]. This block may be stacked with other RTCP packets to
   form compound RTCP packets and share the average reporting interval
   calculated by the RTCP method described in [RFC3550]. It should be
   noted that the metrics in this report block are based on measurements
   that are typically made at the time that a video frame is decoded and
   rendered for playout. The metrics in this block MUST be measured at a
   consistent point.

   The video loss concealment report block has the following format:

    0               1               2               3

      Figure 1: Format for the Video Loss Concealment Report Block

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits

      A Video Loss Concealment Report Block is identified by the
      constant VLC.

      [Note to RFC Editor: Please replace VLC with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]

   Interval Metric Flag (I): 2 bits

      This field indicates whether the reported metric is an interval,
      cumulative, or sampled metric [RFC6792]:

         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
         most recent measurement interval duration between successive
         metrics reports.

         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the

INTERNET DRAFT       <Video LC Metrics for RTCP XR>    December 31, 2014


         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

         I=01: Sampled Value - this value MUST NOT be used for this
         block type.

         I=00: Reserved.

   Video Loss Concealment Method Type (V): 2 bits

      This field is used to identify the video loss concealment method
      type used at the receiver. Each bit indicates one method type, as
      follow:

        V=10 - Frame freeze
        V=11 - Other Loss Concealment Method
        V=01&00 - Reserved

   block length: 16 bits

      This field is in accordance with the definition in [RFC3611]. In
      this report block, it MUST be set to 6. The block MUST be
      discarded if the block length is set to a different value.

   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

   Impaired Duration: 32 bits

      The total time length, expressed in units of millisecond, of video
      impaired by  transmission loss before applying any loss
      concealment methods. 

      Two values are reserved: A value of 0xFFFFFFFE indicates out of
      range (that is, a measured value exceeding 0xFFFFFFFD) and a value
      of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates that the measurement is unavailable.

   Concealed Duration: 32 bits

      The total time length, expressed in units of millisecond, of
      concealed damaged video pictures on which loss concealment method
      corresponding to V is applied.

      Two values are reserved: A value of 0xFFFFFFFE indicates out of
      range (that is, a measured value exceeding 0xFFFFFFFD) and a value
      of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates that the measurement is unavailable.

   Mean Impaired Frame Proportion (MIFP): 8 bits

INTERNET DRAFT       <Video LC Metrics for RTCP XR>    December 31, 2014


      Mean Impaired Frame Proportion is the mean proportion of each
      video frame impaired by loss before applying any loss concealment
      method during the interval, expressed as a fixed point number with
      the binary point at the left edge of the field. It is equivalent
      to taking the integer part after multiplying the loss fraction by
      256. If a video frame is totally lost, a value of 0xFF shall be
      used for the frame when calculating the mean value.

   Mean Concealed Frame Proportion (MCFP): 8 bits

      Mean Concealed Frame Proportion is the mean proportion of each
      video frame to which loss concealment (using V) was applied during
      the interval, expressed as a fixed point number with the binary
      point at the left edge of the field. It is equivalent to taking
      the integer part after multiplying the loss fraction by 256. If a
      lost video frame is totally concealed, a value of 0xFF and if
      there are no concealed macroblocks, a value of 0, shall be used
      for the frame when calculating the mean value.

   Fraction of Frames Subject to Concealment (FFSC): 8 bits

      Fraction of Frames Subject to Concealment is calculated by
      dividing the number of frames to which loss concealment (using V)
      was applied by the total number of frames and expressing this
      value as a fixed point number with the binary point at the left
      edge of the field. It is equivalent to taking the integer part
      after multiplying the loss fraction by 256. A value of 0 indicates
      that there were no concealed frame and a value of 0xFF indicates
      that the frames in the entire measurement interval are all
      concealed.

   Mean Frame Freeze Duration (MFFD): 8 bits

      Mean Frame Freeze Duration is the mean duration of the frame
      freeze events. The value of MFFD shall be calculated by summing
      the total duration of all frame freeze events and dividing by the
      number of events. A value of 0xFF shall be used to indicate a
      value in excess of 12700 milliseconds. A value of 0 MUST be set
      when V=11.

5 SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol) for
   signaling the use of RTCP XR blocks. However XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling (see section 5 of [RFC3611]).

5.1 SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

 


<Huang, et al.>           Expires July 4, 2015                  [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT       <Video LC Metrics for RTCP XR>    December 31, 2014


   This session augments the SDP attribute "rtcp-xr" defined in Section
   5.1 of [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to 
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   xr-format =/ xr-vlc-block

   xr-vlc-block = "video-loss-concealment"

5.2 Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters
   applies.  For detailed usage of Offer/Answer for unilateral
   parameter, refer to section 5.2 of [RFC3611].

6 Security Considerations

   It is believed that this RTCP XR block introduces no new security
   considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611]. This block does
   not provide per-packet statistics, so the risk to confidentially
   documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611] does not apply.

   An attacker may put incorrect information in the Video Loss
   Concealment reports, which will be affect the estimation of video
   loss concealment mechanisms performance and QoE of users.
   Implementers should consider the guidance in [RFC7202] for using
   appropriate security mechanisms, i.e., where security is a concern,
   the implementation should apply encryption and authentication to the
   report block. For example, this can be achieved by using the AVPF
   profile together with the Secure RTP profile as defined in [RFC3711];
   an appropriate combination of the two profiles (an "SAVPF") is
   specified in [RFC5124]. However, other mechanisms also exist
   (documented in [RFC7201]) and might be more suitable.

7 IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration. For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

7.1 New RTCP XR Block Type Value

   This document assigns the block type value VLC in the IANA "RTP
   Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry" to 
   the "Video Loss Concealment Metrics Report Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace VLC with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]
