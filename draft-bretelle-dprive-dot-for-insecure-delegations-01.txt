                 DNS-over-TLS for insecure delegations
         draft-bretelle-dprive-dot-for-insecure-delegations-01

Abstract

   This document describes an alternative mechanism to DANE ([RFC6698])
   in order to authenticate a DNS-over-TLS (DoT [RFC7858]) authoritative
   server by not making DNSSEC a hard requirement, making DoT server
   authentication available for insecure delegations.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes an alternative mechanism to DANE ([RFC6698])
   as described in [I-D.bortzmeyer-dprive-resolver-to-auth] Section 2
   extending the authentication of DNS over Transport Layer Security
   (DoT) [RFC7858] to insecure delegations and therefore enabling the
   onboarding of DoT authoritative servers without the requirement for
   the authorities to support DNSSEC ([RFC4033], [RFC4034], and
   [RFC4035]).  To do so, this document introduce the Delegation Subject
   Public Key Info (DSPKI) resource record, its purpose, usage and
   format.

2.  Terminology

   A server that supports DNS-over-TLS is called a "DoT server" to
   differentiate it from a "DNS Server" (one that provides DNS service
   over any other protocol), likewise, a client that supports this
   protocol is called a "DoT client"

   A secure delegation ([RFC4956] Section 2) is a signed name containing
   a delegation (NS RRset), and a signed DS RRset, signifying a
   delegation to a signed zone.

   An insecure delegation ([RFC4956] Section 2) is a signed name
   containing a delegation (NS RRset), but lacking a DS RRset,
   signifying a delegation to an unsigned subzone.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Authenticating an insecure delegation

   To authenticate a DoT server of a secure delegation, it is possible
   to use the TLSA resource record [RFC6698] of the nameserver as
   decribed in [I-D.bortzmeyer-dprive-resolver-to-auth] Section 2, while
   this method is valid, the absence of support of DNSSEC for such
   delegations precludes the onboarding and discovery of nameservers
   serving those zones as DoT servers.

   Without the use of DNSSEC, a delegation is not able to authenticate
   itself as the chain of trust cannot be followed, however other
   mechanisms exist to have a server authenticate itself, such as Public
   Key Infrastructure (PKIX [RFC6125]) , SPKI, which have their own pros
   and cons.

3.1.  Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX)

   It would be possible to authenticate the name servers of the insecure
   delegation using PKIX, relying on an existing trust model and trust
   anchors.

   While simple, a single trusted Certificate Authority (CA) that breaks
   said trust (voluntarily or involuntarily), can issue certificate for
   any domains, allowing an attacker to potentially impersonate both the
   application and the DoT server.

   Another issue that rises is that the DoT servers may use an identity
   which belong to the same origin as application servers, which could
   permit personal information (such as cookies) to be leaked to the DoT
   servers.

3.2.  Subject Public Key Info (SPKI)

   The zone owner generates his own certificate and distribute the SPKI
   fingerprint into the DNS.

   This is in essence what, amongst other things, TLSA records solve but
   with the requirement for DNSSEC to be enabled and functional for the
   queried zone.  For insecure delegations, simply advertising the SPKI
   fingerprint would be trivial to intercept, disable, and modify.

3.3.  Authenticating from the parent

   While a delegation is not secured, the DNS core infrastructure
   already support, for the most part, DNSSEC, meaning that if the owner
   of an insecure delegation could set the SPKI fingerprint in a
   resource record (RR) at the parent, such fingerprint could be signed
   and validated by the DoT client.  The DoT client can then establish a
   TLS connection to the zone name servers and authenticate the DoT
   server against the fingerprint acquired earlier from the parent zone.

3.3.1.  Example

   example.com is an insecure delegation from .com which has set the
   DSPKI RRset.

   A DoT client looking for records under example.com will learn from
   .com that example.com is delegated to

   example.com IN 172800 NS ns1.example.com
   example.com IN 172800 NS ns2.example.com
   # sha256
   example.com IN DSPKI (
       1 4e44f900cdeb8c769f4df97e23f8fc81
         4ac4bf45a3d9dc265a2ed925171f0b71 )
   # sha512
   example.com IN DSPKI (
       2 ab40ed300fd220d8c72a600069f9ceb1
         f9fd7c003117e4ef34b228da1c9d76a0
         500be99e82a0c01e7f80930a46ad28b8
         ed3d5ed2df34d822b5f56c99f45889ef
   )
   ns1.example.com IN 172800 AAAA 2001:db8:abcd:12:1:2:3:4
   ns2.example.com IN 172800 AAAA 2001:db8:abcd:ab:1:2:3:4

   with the accompanying signature.

   The DSPKI RRset signals that the nameservers are able to support DNS-
   over-TLS.  The DoT client can then establish a TLS connection to the
   DoT server and authenticate them by ensuring that the SPKI matches
   the one learned from the parent zone.

4.  DSPKI Resource Record

   There may be 0 or more DSPKI served by the parent of the delegation.
   0 means that DSPKI is not supported, therefore the DoT client could
   try other alternatives.  1 or multiple public keys can be distributed
   to let the DoT client validate multiple public keys, which can be
   useful while doing certificate rotation or when willing to provide

   different secret keys to different providers that may serve the
   delegated zone.

4.1.  The DSPKI Resource Record

   The DSPKI resource record (RR) is used to associate a DoT server
   public key (SPKI) with the zone it is serving.

4.1.1.  DSPKI RDATA Wire Format

   The RDATA of the DSPKI RR consists of a one-octet matching type
   field, and the DER-encoded binary structure of the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo field as defined in [RFC5280].

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | matching type | DER-encoded SPKI field                        /
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                                               /
   /                                                               /
   /                                                               /
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.1.1.1.  The Matching Type Field

   A one-octet value, called "matching type", specifies how the SPKI is
   presented.  The types defined in this document are:

   o  0 - Exact match on SPKI

   o  1 - SHA-256 hash of SPKI

   o  2 - SHA-512 hash of SPKI

   Where the SPKI can be extracted as follow:

openssl x509 -in cert.pem -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der

   and the SHA-256 as:

openssl x509 -in cert.pem -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | \
    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary

   *FIXME*: consider

   o  alternate URI to support DoT (host, port, spki), DoH (host, port,
      URL template), DNS-over-QUIC... would rather be an ALTNS type of
      record
