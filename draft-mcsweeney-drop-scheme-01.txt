1.  Introduction

   This document is provided to inform the internet community of the
'drop' URI scheme and to meet the required guidelines of a permanent
URI scheme. This scheme shortens the path to further unifying
communications by using public mechanisms of continuity for the pre-
resolution of private and public service integration.


2.  Scheme definitions and syntax

2.1.  Demonstrable, New, Long-Lived Utility

   Phone numbers and physical addresses are antiquated but still very
useful. But what is to say that they both can not be represented by the
same character string?  For any given person or business, it is simpler
to enter a single string into one's phone than what is currently an ever
growing list of communication method identifiers.  When an owner is able
to update contact information it requires no changes by another user's
contact list or database.  People, businesses, and machines generally
have a wide variety of, and specific uses for, different modes of
communication.  Where those modes of communication overlap, there should
also be consolidation.  The 'drop' scheme was created in a way to be
able to reuse current infrastructure making it easy to use and quick to
deploy.

2.2.  Syntactic Compatibility
 
   "While it is common for schemes to further delegate their
   substructure to the URI's owner, publishing independent standards
   that mandate particular forms of URI substructure is inappropriate,
   because that essentially usurps ownership.  [RFC7320] abstract

nonetheless....

   "The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all
   valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components
   of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements
   of every possible identifier.  [RFC3986  abstract]
   
Section 3 of [RFC3986] defines the overall syntax for URIs and offers a
couple examples showing the component parts (1-5).  The scheme and path
components are required, though the path may be empty (no characters).


         foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
         \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
          |           |            |          |          |
URI=  scheme(1)  authority(2)    path(3)    query(4)   fragment(5)
          |   _____________________|__
         / \ /                        \
         urn:example:animal:ferret:nose


The 'drop' URI does not use all 5 of the parse-able components 
available to it.  Instead, it uses only the required scheme(1) and 
path(3) components.  Previously registered URIs such as the 'tel' 
[RFC3966] and 'geo' [RFC5870] schemes also use a limited number of 
components.  But unlike these other schemes the 'drop' scheme uses the
number sign '#' as a general delimiter where typically a colon ":" is
found. The ":" and the "#" are two of the seven charcters catagorized as
general delimiters (gen-delims) in the "reserved" set.  The general 
delimiters (gen-delims), described in Section 2.2 [RFC3986], can be used
to seperate generic URI components(1-5).  The "#" is defined as a
delimiter by the implementation-specific syntax of the 'drop' URI's 
dereferencing algorithm.  The 'drop' scheme syntax is as follows: 

drop-uri = drop "#" character string


            drop   #    fg34htx
            \__/  \_/   \_____/
             |     |       |
         <scheme>  |  <scheme-specific-part>
               <gen-delim>  


Characters of the scheme-specific-part have not been limited.
The following are some examples of 'drop' URIs:

         drop#sd54g54  |  drop#34.56  |  drop#fgte8g-234.45

After the first step of resolution, the scheme-specific part of a 'drop'
URI becomes the subdomain portion of a FQDN where the resource(s) can be
located or further processing continued. It would look similar to
'sd54g54.dropexample.com'.  There will be only one second level domain
for http use. This subdomain characteristic gives it a global 
uniqueness which adds value and prevents ambiguity. 

Compared against other URI schemes, the 'drop' scheme's use of a number 
sign makes the scheme in its entirety unique, including the
scheme-specific-part.  More so,  the scheme-specific-part can be user 
generated to add an extra layer of uniquess.  Sending a fax to the same
digits as a phone call has been for around a long time proving that 
being unique and being common can coexist.  The 'drop' scheme can extend
that commonality to the web and beyond.


2.3.  Definitions and Operations

Primarily functioning as a locator there are three ways to get to a
'drop' URI resource; http, SRV records, and private resolution.  Private
resolution is only used if the resource(s) can not be found using the 
previous two methods.  This resource retrieval process utilizes the 
Dynamic Delegation Discovery System [RFC3401].  Invoking the 'drop' URI 
will cause a lookup for matching application information starting with 
an A record [RFC1035], then on to Service Records [RFC2782], and then on
to other available records that may offer a new rule set for resolution.
As an example use case, when the 'drop' scheme is typed into the address
bar of a browser, the dns returns a FQDN to where the browser may then 
go and retrieve a HTML document.  Similarly, the same scheme-specific 
part can be used in a messaging address, or mapping location 
application.  Reusability of a scheme-specific-part that has an output 
of a hierarchical structure representing an administrative delegation 
that translates into a domain name makes this scheme a perfect fit for 
domain name system [RFC6950] section 3.3.  Users and owners define what 
operations are available.  One user may have sip services enabled while
another may only let you go to a company's webpage. 

Permanency of what is identified by the scheme-specific-part is not 
guaranteed and is user specific.  Permanency of a specific 
scheme-specific-part is not guaranteed to exist or that it will re-exist
after it had once existed. There may be a future need where the 'drop' 
URI scheme will want to be used as a strict identifier so it would not 
be fair to constrain the definition of this scheme in this document at 
this time. Other future uses beyond what is commonly known of unique 
subdomain creation should be anticipated for this 'drop' scheme.


2.4.  Internationalization and Character Encoding

   The 'drop' scheme name follows the syntax of Section 3.1 of [RFC3986]
which only allows for a limited number of characters (US-ASCII).  
The scheme name is also sufficiently short and distinguishable to 
avoid problems.  The 'drop' scheme name does not identify any 
particular application and does not have any correspondence with a 
particular service name.  Queries that come in non-ASCII encoding 
must be allowed to go forward so that private resolution can continue 
if A and SRV record lookups fail.

2.5.  Interoperability Considerations

   The scheme creator is not aware of any details regarding the scheme 
that may impact interoperability.

3.    URI Scheme Registration Request

4.  IANA Considerations

   registration update request - permanent
   
5.  Security Considerations

Security is partly dependent on the resource being located
and the application being used for the locating.  Generally, security 
concerns for this URI would come from the use of the URI and not 
necessarily from the URI itself as [RFC3986] section 7 describes. 
Examples are, domain spoofing, malicious redirection, domain hijacking,
and phishing attacks.
