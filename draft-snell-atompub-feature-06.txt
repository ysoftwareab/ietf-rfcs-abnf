1.  Introduction

   This document introduces extensions for the Atom Publishing Protocol
   service document format for expressing metadata about the behaviors,
   functions and capabilities supported by an Atom Publishing Protocol
   collection.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

     "f": "http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0"

   This specification uses terms from the XML Infoset
   [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204].  However, this specification uses a
   shorthand; the phrase "Information Item" is omitted when naming
   Element Information Items.  Therefore, when this specification uses
   the terms "element" and "attribute" it is referring, respectively, to
   the Element and Attribute Information Items in Infoset terms.

   This specification uses the terms "atomUri" and
   "atomCommonAttributes" from the non-normative RELAX NG Compact schema
   included in [RFC4287].  Where used, these serve the same purpose and
   have the same meaning as their use in [RFC4287].

   Atom allows the use of IRIs [RFC3987].  Every URI [RFC3986] is also
   an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever below an IRI is named.  There
   are two special considerations: (1) when an IRI that is not also a
   URI is given for dereferencing, it MUST be mapped to a URI using the
   steps in Section 3.1 of [RFC3987] and (2) when an IRI is serving as
   an identifier, it MUST NOT be so mapped.

   Any element defined by this specification MAY have an xml:base
   attribute [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627].  When xml:base is used, it
   serves the function described in section 5.1.1 of [RFC3986],
   establishing the base URI (or IRI) for resolving any relative
   references found within the effective scope of the xml:base
   attribute.

   Any element defined by this specification MAY have an xml:lang
   attribute, whose content indicates the natural language for the

   element and its descendents.  The language context is only
   significant for elements and attributes declared to be "Language-
   Sensitive".  Requirements regarding the content and interpretation of
   xml:lang are specified in XML 1.0 [W3C.REC-xml-20040204], Section
   2.12.


3.  The f:feature element

   A feature is an abstract behavior, function and capability supported
   by an Atom Publishing Protocol collection.  Examples of features that
   might be supported by an Atom publishing server include support for
   draft entries, scheduled publication of entries, use of a particular
   set of Atom format extensions, use of a particular authentication
   scheme, and so on.  The f:feature element can be used in an app:
   collection element to indicate that the collection supports the
   feature specified and may require that a client wishing to use the
   endpoint use that feature.  Features are identified using permanent,
   universally unique IRI's.

     namespace f = "http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0"

     feature = element f:feature {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute ref    { atomUri },
       attribute status { 'supported' | 'required' | 'unsupported'}?,
       attribute href   { atomUri }?,
       attribute label  { text }?,
       (anyElement)*
     }

     anyElement = element * - f:* {
       (attribute * { text }
         | text
         | anyElement)*
     }

   The ref attribute specifies a globally unique IRI identifying a
   feature supported by a collection.  The value of the ref attribute
   MUST be compared on a case-sensitive, character-by-character basis.
   Relative references MUST NOT be used.

   The status attribute indicates a collections level of support for the
   identified feature.  The value of the attribute can be "supported",
   "required" or "unsupported".  If not specified, the value is assumed
   to be "supported".

   o  The value "supported" indicates that the server supports the
      identified feature.  Clients MAY utilize the feature when
      interacting with the collection.
   o  The value "required" indicates that server supports the identified
      feature.  Clients MUST utilize the feature when interacting with
      the collection.
   o  The value "unsupported" indicates that the server explicitly does
      not support a feature.  Clients SHOULD NOT utilize the feature
      when interacting with the collection.

   An optional href attribute MAY be used to specify the URI of a human-
   readable description of the feature.  Relative references MAY be
   used.

   The optional label attribute MAY be used to specify a human-readable
   label for the feature.  The value of the label attribute is Language-
   Sensitive as defined by Section 2 of [RFC4287].

   The f:feature element MAY contain child elements and attributes other
   than those defined in this specification.  Such "foreign markup" are
   considered to be metadata applicable to the feature identified by the
   f:feature element.  Software agents MUST NOT stop processing or
   signal an error or change their behavior as a result of encountering
   such foreign markup.

   An app:collection element MAY contain zero or more f:feature elements
   but MUST NOT contain more than one with the same ref attribute value.
   The order in which f:feature elements appear within the app:
   collection element is insignificant.

   The f:feature element MAY contain attributes included as part of the
   atomCommonAttributes production defined by Section 2 of [RFC4287] or
   any update thereof.  When used on an f:feature element, such
   attributes serve the same purpose described in [RFC4287] or their
   corresponding specifications.

3.1.  Example

   The following is an example of a collection supporting one
   hypothetical required feature, one unsupported feature, and a number
   of supported features.

     <service
       xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2007/app"
       xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
       xmlns:f="http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0">
       <workspace>
         <atom:title>My Workspace</atom:title>
         <collection href="...">
           <atom:title>My Atom Collection</atom:title>
           <accept>application/atom+xml;type=entry</accept>
           <f:feature
             ref="http://www.w3.org/2007/app/drafts" />
           <f:feature
             ref="http://www.w3.org/2007/app/xhtml-content" />
           <f:feature
             ref="http://www.w3.org/2007/app/preserve-extensions" />
           <f:feature
             ref="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0" />
           <f:feature
             ref="http://www.w3.org/2007/app/binary-content"
             status="unsupported" />
           <f:feature
             ref="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/GoogleLogin"
             href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/"
             label="Google Login" status="required" />
         </collection>
       </workspace>
     </app:server>


4.  The f:type element

   The content of an f:type element is a media-range as defined in
   [RFC2616].  The media range specifies a type of content that can be
   included in an atom:content element or referenced by the atom:content
   src attribute.

     type =
       element f:type {
         atomCommonAttributes,
         ( text? )
       }

Internet-Draft                APP Features                   August 2007


   The f:type element is similar to the HTTP Accept request-header
   [RFC2616].  Media type parameters are allowed within f:type, but
   f:type has no notion of preference - "accept-params" or "q"
   arguments, as specified in Section 14.1 of [RFC2616] are not
   significant.

   White space (as defined in [REC-xml]) around the f:type element's
   media-range is insignificant and MUST be ignored.

   Any number of f:type elements MAY appear as children of an f:feature
   element whose ref attribute identifies the "XML Content", "Binary
   Content" or "Reference Content" features as defined in Section 6.1.1.
   When used with these features, the f:type elements specify the range
   of media types that can be specified in the atom:content elements
   type attribute.  If no f:type element is present, clients SHOULD
   treat this as equivalent to an f:type element with the content "*/*".

   The order of f:type elements within a f:feature element is
   insignificant.

4.1.  An example f:feature using the f:type element


     <f:feature
       ref="http://www.w3.org/2007/app/binary-content">
       <f:type>image/jpg</f:type>
       <f:type>image/png</f:type>
       <f:type>image/gif</f:type>
       <f:type>text/*</f:type>
     </f:feature>



5.  Security Considerations

   Specific features supported by a collection may introduce security
   considerations and concerns beyond those discussed by the Atom
   Publishing Protocol and Atom Syndication Format specifications.
   Implementors must refer to the specifications and description of each
   feature to determine the security considerations relevant to each.


6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Registry of Atom Publishing Features

   The Registry of Atom Publishing Features is maintained by IANA and
   contains information about known features that can be supported by

   Atom Publishing Protocol implementations.  New assignments are
   subject to IESG approval, as outlined in [RFC2434].  Requests should
   be made by email to IANA, which will then forward the request to the
   IESG, requesting approval.  The request should use the following
   template:

   o  Ref: (A globally unique IRI identifying the feature)
   o  Label: (A human-readable label for the feature)
   o  Description: (A human-readable description of the feature)
