Abstract

   The Mobile Application Part (MAP) protocol is a signaling protocol
   for cellular networks.  The MAP Security (MAPSEC) protocol provides a
   secure way to transport MAP messages.  To use MAPSEC, however,
   Security Associations (SAs) are needed.  This document defines how
   such SAs can be created automatically.  We use the Internet Security
   Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) as a framework for
   managing SAs and establishing keys.  The framework can be specialized
   to a particular task.  Such a specialization is called a Domain of
   Interpretation (DOI), and this document defines the MAPSEC DOI.  This

   specialization is very similar to the Internet Key Exchange protocol
   and the ISAKMP specialization for IP Security, except that SAs for
   use with non-IP protocols are being negotiated.

2. Introduction

2.1 MAP and MAPSEC

   In the Global Mobile System (GSM) and Universal Mobile
   Telecommunication System (UMTS) networks, the MAP protocol plays a
   central role in the signaling communications between the Network
   Elements (NEs).  User profile exchange, authentication, and mobility
   management are performed using MAP.  MAP typically runs over the
   Signaling System number 7 (SS7) protocol stack.  For a full
   description of the MAP protocol, see [6].

   The mobile networks are moving to IP-based solutions.  Completely
   IP-based networks and new signaling protocols will replace MAP at
   some point.  However, MAP and SS7 signaling networks have to be
   supported during the transition time, and beyond, due to the need to
   retain legacy equipment in networks.

   MAP has a role in the authentication process of GSM phones, and
   operators are concerned about its lack of cryptographic security
   support.  For this reason a new protocol header has been developed to
   protect MAP messages, much in the same way as the Encapsulating
   Security Payload (ESP) protocol protects IP packets.  This new
   protocol is called MAPSEC [7].  A key management mechanism is also
   needed for MAPSEC.  This key management mechanism runs over IP.

2.2 Domains of Interpretation

   The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol
   (ISAKMP) provides a common framework for protocols that manage
   Security Associations (SAs) and establish keys.  This framework may
   be specialized to different tasks, with different requirements and
   security properties.  Each such specialization results in a new
   task-specific protocol.  ISAKMP provides a common message format for
   these protocols.

   A specialization of ISAKMP is called a Domain of Interpretation
   (DOI).  A DOI defines the interpretation of task-specific parts in
   ISAKMP messages.  These parts include the fields which are used to
   inform the peer about the supported cryptographic algorithms and
   protocols, and the fields which are used to carry the identities of
   the parties.  As ISAKMP is used in different tasks, the required
   algorithms and other parameters may be different.

   For instance, the IP Security DOI [4] describes the use of ISAKMP in
   the context of IP Security protocols (AH, ESP) and IP Compression.
   The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol uses the IP Security DOI.
   The IKE protocol, and the parameters of the DOI are divided in two

   phases: In Phase 1, an authentication is performed and protection for
   ISAKMP itself is set up.  In Phase 2, actual AH and ESP SAs are
   negotiated.

   This document defines the MAPSEC DOI for ISAKMP.  This DOI can be
   used to negotiate MAPSEC SAs.  Phase 1 related issues for the MAPSEC
   DOI are described in Section 3.  Phase 2 related issues are described
   in Section 4.  In addition, 3GPP Technical Specifications [7] specify
   the actual MAPSEC authentication and encryption algorithms and the so
   called protection profiles.  Protection Profiles indicate the
   protection requirements for each MAP message type.  [7] defines also
   the values that are used in the MAPSEC DOI to refer to these
   algorithms and profiles.  This ensures that the MAPSEC DOI document
   does not have to be modified upon the development of a new
   authentication algorithm, for instance.

   This new DOI is very similar to the IP Security DOI and IKE.  The
   only technical differences are with respect to the Phase 2, otherwise
   a subset of the IP Security DOI and IKE is used.  MAPSEC DOI is
   separated from IKE as a new DOI rather than an extension of the
   current one in order to allow the two protocols to have different
   port numbers, name spaces, and change control in the future.

   If IKE is developed further or replaced by new protocols, it is
   possible to update the MAPSEC DOI to use a new protocol.  Such an
   update would involve extending the new protocol to allow other
   protocols than AH and ESP, and allowing certain new algorithm
   identifiers and other parameters.

2.3 Network Architecture

   The MAP Security (MAPSEC) protocol and its key management part
   provide authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and replay
   protection services to the MAP messages it transports.

   The purpose of the MAPSEC header in the protocol is to provide enough
   information to determine the MAPSEC SA and Protection Profiles used
   in securing the MAP operation that follows the header.

   MAPSEC DOI and IKE are used to set up SAs for nodes implementing
   MAPSEC.  While the MAP protocol usually runs over SS7, the MAPSEC DOI
   and IKE are always run over IP.  Therefore, it is assumed that nodes
   or networks implementing MAPSEC always have IP connectivity in
   addition to SS7 connectivity.  Figure 1 below depicts the situation.

           Figure 1: Network architecture for MAPSEC


   The network architectures where the MAPSEC DOI can be run includes,
   but are not limited to, the one defined by 3GPP [7].  In the 3GPP
   architecture the MAPSEC is typically run between two different
   network operators, and the same SAs are shared by a number of NEs.

   As in IKE, the MAPSEC DOI always establishes two simplex SAs, one for
   the incoming and another one for the outgoing direction.  These SAs
   differ only with respect to the keys, SPIs, and peer identities but
   all other parameters including the algorithms MUST have the same
   values.

3. MAPSEC DOI Phase 1

   For Phase 1, all IP Security DOI definitions [4] and IKE procedures
   [5, 3] MUST be used unchanged in the MAPSEC DOI, including the way
   that peers are authenticated.  However, with the MAPSEC DOI the
   following exceptions to the full requirements will apply:

   o  All MAPSEC DOI communications SHOULD run on port < To Be Assigned
      by IANA > instead of the standard IKE port 500.  This applies to
      both Phase 1 and 2.  Additionally, MAPSEC DOI implementations MUST
      send the value zero in the port field of the identity payload
      during Phase 1 (standard IKE allows either 0 or 500).

   o  Support for Perfect Forward  Secrecy (PFS) is  NOT REQUIRED.  An
      implementation that receives a Phase 2 negotiation request with
      PFS on MAY decline the negotiation.

   o  Only one  identity  type,  ID_FQDN,  MUST  be implemented for
      Phase 1.  Other identity types specified in [4] SHOULD be
      implemented.

   o  Only the AES encryption [1] and HMAC-SHA1-96 hash [10] algorithms
      MUST be implemented as ISAKMP encryption and hash operations.  As
      in IKE, HMAC-SHA1-96 MUST also be implemented as the default
      pseudo random function.

   Implementer's note: IKE [3] specifies that all implementations MUST
   support authentication through pre-shared secrets and SHOULD support
   public key based authentication.  All implementations also MUST
   support Main Mode.

3.1 MAPSEC DOI Number

   Within ISAKMP, all DOI's MUST be registered with the IANA.  This
   number is < To Be Assigned by IANA >.

Internet-Draft                 MAPSEC DOI                     March 2004


4. MAPSEC DOI Phase 2

   IKE procedures regarding Phase 2 are used unchanged, with the
   following exceptions:

   o  Identity types used in Phase 2 are different.

   o  SA payloads are different.

   o  There are no MAPSEC-specific Phase 2 notifications.

   Note also that all implementations of the MAPSEC DOI MUST be able to
   handle the deletion of an existing SA (allowed also by IKE).

4.1 Naming Scheme

   Within the MAPSEC DOI, all well-known identifiers MUST be registered
   as explained in Section 7.

   All multi-octet binary values are stored in network byte order.

4.2 MAPSEC Situation Definition

   Within ISAKMP, the Situation field provides information that can be
   used by the responder to make a policy determination about how to
   process the incoming negotiation request.  For the MAPSEC DOI, the
   Situation field in Phase 1 is handled as specified by the IP Security
   DOI [4].  In Phase 2, the Situation field MUST be a four (4) octet
   bitmask with the following value:

          Situation                   Value
          ---------                   -----
          SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY           0x01


4.2.1 SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY

   The SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY type specifies that the SA will be identified
   by source identity information present in an associated
   Identification Payload.  See Section 4.6.1 for a complete description
   of the various Identification types.  All MAPSEC DOI implementations
   MUST support SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY by including two Identification
   Payloads in the Phase 2 exchange, and MUST abort any negotiation that
   fails to do so.

4.3 MAPSEC Policy Requirements

   The policy requirements for nodes implementing the MAPSEC DOI are

   beyond the scope of this document.  However, it is required that
   systems are able to specify their policies with respect to the MAP
   traffic in terms of Protection Profiles as defined in [7].  These
   Protection Profiles indicate the need for a particular kind of
   protection based on the type of the MAP message.  For the purposes of
   this document a Protection Profile is a 16 bit number that is agreed
   during the SA negotiation.

4.4 MAPSEC Assigned Numbers

   The following sections list the Assigned Numbers for the MAPSEC DOI.
   Sections 5.4.1 to 5.5 describe Protocol Identifiers, MAPSEC Transform
   Identifiers and Security Association Attribute Type Values.  Section
         4.6 describes ID Payload Type Values and Notify Message Types.

4.4.1 MAPSEC Security Protocol Identifier

   The ISAKMP proposal syntax was specifically designed to allow for the
   simultaneous negotiation of multiple Phase 2 security protocol suites
   within a single negotiation.  As a result, the protocol suites listed
   below form the set of protocols that can be negotiated at the same
   time.  The combination of protocol suites that may be negotiated
   together is a host policy decision.

   The following table lists the values for the Security Protocol
   Identifiers referenced in an ISAKMP Proposal Payload for the MAPSEC
   DOI.

          Protocol ID                         Value
          -----------                         -----
          RESERVED                            0-1
          PROTO_MAPSEC                        < To Be Assigned by IANA >


4.4.1.1 PROTO_MAPSEC

   The PROTO_MAPSEC type specifies the use of the MAPSEC to protect MAP
   messages.

4.4.2 MAPSEC Transform Identifiers

   The following table lists the reserved MAPSEC Transform Identifiers.

          Transform ID                        Value
          ------------                        -----
          RESERVED                            0-1

   Technical Specification  [7].

4.5 MAPSEC Security Association Attributes

   The following SA attribute definitions are used in Phase 2 of an IKE
   negotiation.  Attribute types can be either Basic (B) or
   Variable-Length (V).  Encoding of these attributes is defined in the
   base ISAKMP specification.

   Attributes defined as Basic MUST NOT be encoded as Variable-Length.
   Variable-Length attributes MAY be encoded as Basic attributes if
   their value can fit into two octets.  See [3] for further information
   on attribute encoding in the MAPSEC DOI.  All restrictions listed in
   [3] also apply to the MAPSEC DOI.

   Implementer's note: The attributes described here behave exactly as
   the corresponding ones in the IP Security DOI, unless otherwise
   explicitly specified.  For the purposes of reusing IP Security DOI
   code, the parameters not used by MAPSEC DOI are defined as class
   RESERVED (values 4, 8, and 9).

          Attribute Types

                class               value           type

          MAP PP Version Indicator    101             B

   Class Definitions are as follows:

   SA Life Type

   SA Duration

      Specifies the time-to-live for the SA.  When the SA expires, the
      SA MUST be renegotiated.  MAPSEC messages using the expired SA
      MUST no longer be either sent or accepted as input.  In MAPSEC
      DOI, the SA Life Type value MUST be seconds (1).



Arkko & Blom           Expires September 20, 2004              [Page 10]


      For a given Life Type, the value of the Life Duration attribute
      defines the actual length of the component lifetime -- in this
      case in seconds.  If unspecified, the default value MUST be
      assumed to be 28800 seconds (8 hours).

      The SA Life Duration attribute MUST always follow the SA Life Type
      attribute.

      Implementer's note: The semantics and values for these attributes
      are exactly as defined in [4], except that kilobyte lifetimes are
      not supported.

   Group Description

      Specifies the Oakley Group to be used in a PFS QM negotiation.
      For a list of supported values, see Appendix A of [3].

      Implementer's note: The semantics and values for these attributes
      are exactly as defined in [4].

      Authentication Algorithm values are defined in the 3GPP Technical
      Specification [7].

      There is no default value for Authentication Algorithm.  It MUST
      be always sent.

      Implementer's note: The first five values are reserved by the IP
      Security DOI.

   Key Length


              RESERVED                0

      There is no default value for Key Length.  This attribute MUST be
      sent for transforms that use ciphers with variable key lengths.
      For fixed length ciphers, the Key Length attribute MUST NOT be
      sent.  The definition of MAPSEC transforms in the 3GPP Technical
      Specifications such as [7] MUST specify if the use of Key Length
      is necessary and what the legal values are.

      Implementer's note: The semantics and values for these attributes
      are exactly as defined in [4].

   Key Rounds


              RESERVED                0

      There is no default value for Key Rounds, as it must be specified
      for transforms using ciphers with varying numbers of rounds.

      Implementer's note: The semantics and values for these attributes
      are exactly as defined in [4].

   MAP Protection Profile

      The value of this attribute is a 16-bit entity as defined in [7].

   MAP PP Version Indicator

      The Protection Profile Version Indicator allows different versions
      of protection profiles to be used.  The value of this attribute is
      a 16-bit entity as defined in [7].


4.5.1 Required Attribute Support

   To ensure basic interoperability, all implementations MUST be able to
   negotiate all of the following attributes:

      SA Life Type
      SA Duration
      Authentication Algorithm
      Key Length
      MAP Protection Profile
      MAP PP Version Indicator


4.5.2 Attribute Negotiation

   If an implementation receives a defined MAPSEC DOI attribute (or
   attribute value) which it does not support, an ATTRIBUTES-NOT-
   SUPPORTED Notification Payload SHOULD be returned and the negotiation
   MUST be aborted, unless the attribute value is in the reserved range.

   If an implementation receives an attribute value in the reserved
   range, an implementation MAY choose to continue based on local
   policy.

   Implementer's note: This follows exactly the IP Security DOI.
   However, there are no special lifetime attribute parsing

   requirements, since only time-based lifetimes are supported.

4.5.3 Lifetime Matching

   Offered and locally acceptable SA lifetimes must match exactly under
   MAPSEC in order for the responder to select an SA.

   Implementer's note: This is simplified from the IP Security DOI which
   required notifications.  In the MAPSEC DOI lifetime notifications are
   not defined and hence not used.

4.6 SA Payload Content

   The SA Payloads that the Initiator and the Responder exchange control
   the SAs that actually get installed.  The attributes discussed above
   are a part of the SA Payloads.  For a definition of a MAPSEC SA, see
   [7].

   The following sections describe those ISAKMP payloads whose data
   representations are dependent on the applicable DOI.

4.6.1 Identification Payload Content

   The initiator of the negotiation is identified using the
   Identification Payload.  The responder SHOULD use the initiator's
   identity to determine the correct security policy for creating SAs.

   During Phase 1, the ID port and protocol fields MUST be set to zero
   or to the UDP port that the MAPSEC DOI is running on.  If an
   implementation receives any other values, this MUST be treated as an
   error and the negotiation MUST be aborted.

   The following diagram illustrates the content of the Identification
   Payload.

   The Identification Payload fields are defined as follows:

Internet-Draft                 MAPSEC DOI                     March 2004


   Next Payload (1 octet)

      Identifier for the type of the next payload in the message.  If
      the current payload is the last in the message, this field will be
      zero (0).

   RESERVED (1 octet)

      Unused, must be zero (0).

   Payload Length (2 octets)

      Length, in octets, of the identification data, including the
      generic header.

   Identification Type (1 octet)

      Value describing the identity information found in the
      Identification Data field.

   Protocol ID (1 octet)

      Value specifying an associated Transport Layer Protocol ID (e.g.
      UDP/TCP).  Value zero means that the Protocol ID field should be
      ignored.  In the MAPSEC DOI Phase 2, the Protocol field MUST
      always be zero (0).

   Port (2 octets)

      Value specifying an associated port.  A value of zero means that
      the Port field should be ignored.  In the MAPSEC DOI, value of
      zero MUST always be used in Phase 2.  Unlike in IP traffic
      protected by IP Security, the concept of a port is not used in
      MAP.

   Identification Data (variable length)

      Value, as indicated by the Identification Type.

   The legal Identification Type field values in Phase 1 are as defined
   in [4].  Phase 2 identities MUST conform to the following table.  The
   table lists the assigned values for the Identification Type field
   found in the Identification Payload.  (Values from 0 to 12 are
   reserved by the IP Security DOI and other documents.)

          ID Type                   Value

          ID_PLMN_ID                100

   In MAPSEC DOI, the ID_PLMN_ID type specifies PLMN ID of the Initiator
   or the Responder.  The PLMN ID MUST be represented as defined in
   section 17.7.8 of [6], i.e.  as a three octet data item with the
   Mobile Country Code (MCC) followed by the Mobile Network Code (MNC).
   The size of the PLMN ID MUST correspond to the size in the ID payload
   header.

4.6.2 Notify Message Types

   There are no DOI-specific Notify Message types for the MAPSEC DOI in
   Phase 2.

   Note however that Phase 1 uses the standard ISAKMP and IP Security
   DOI notifications that are defined in section 3.14.1 of [5] and
   section 4.6.3 of [4], respectively.  Even Phase 2 of the MAPSEC DOI
   uses standard ISAKMP notifications.

   Implementer's note: The reason why MAPSEC DOI does not need the same
   Phase 2 DOI-specific notifications is the following.  MAPSEC does not
   allow turning replay protection on or off, which makes the use of
   REPLAY-STATUS unnecessary.  Responder lifetimes are required to be
   exactly the same as the initiator lifetimes, which makes the use of
   RESPONDER-LIFETIME unnecessary.  INITIAL-CONTACT notification on the
   other hand is used exclusively in Phase 1, and is therefore
   applicable also for MAPSEC DOI in Phase 1.

4.7 MAPSEC Key Exchange Requirements

   The MAPSEC DOI introduces no additional Key Exchange types.

5. Key Derivation for MAPSEC

   MAPSEC requires two sets of keys, one for each direction, just as in
   the case of IP Security SAs.  Separate authentication and encryption
   keys are also needed for each direction.  For one direction, these
   two keys are taken from the keying material in following order: first
   the authentication key, and then the encryption key.

   The keys are derived with the procedure described in Section 5.5 of
   [3].

   Implementer's note: The same procedure is used in order to simplify
   specification and implementation.  Note also that one of the
   parameters needed for the derivation process is constant, i.e.  the
   protocol is always PROTO_MAPSEC.

6. Security Considerations

   This entire memo relates to the Internet Key Exchange protocol ([3]),
   which combines ISAKMP ([5]) and Oakley ([14]) to provide the
   derivation of cryptographic keying material in a secure and
   authenticated manner.  Specific discussion of the various security
   protocols and transforms identified in this document can be found in
   the associated base documents and in the cipher references.

Internet-Draft                 MAPSEC DOI                     March 2004


7. IANA Considerations

   IANA should allocate a port number for running MAPSEC DOI with ISAKMP
   (see Section 3).  IANA should also allocate a new DOI number for
   MAPSEC (see Section 3.1) and a new ISAKMP Security Protocol
   Identifier value for PROTO_MAPSEC (see Section 4.4.1).

   In addition, this document contains many parameters to be maintained
   by the the standardization bodies.  In the case of the MAPSEC DOI,
   3GPP will assign many of the parameters normally maintained by IANA.
   This section explains how 3GPP will assign new values for different
   MAPSEC DOI related parameters.  All values not explicitly defined in
   previous sections will be assigned by 3GPP.  IANA will define the DOI
   numbers, including the DOI number for the MAPSEC DOI.

7.1 MAPSEC Situation Definition

   The Situation Definition is a 32-bit bitmask which represents the
   environment under which the MAPSEC SA proposal and negotiation is
   carried out.  Requests for new Situation Definition values must be
   accompanied by a 3GPP Technical Specification which describes the new
   Situation.

   The upper two bits are reserved for private use between cooperating
   systems.

7.2 MAPSEC Security Protocol Identifiers

   The Security Protocol Identifier is an 8-bit value which identifies a
   security protocol suite being negotiated.  Requests for new security
   protocol identifiers must be accompanied by a 3GPP Technical
   Specification which describes the security protocol.

   The values 249-255 are reserved for private use between cooperating
   systems.

7.3 MAPSEC Transform Identifiers

   The MAPSEC Transform Identifier is an 8-bit value which identifies
   the algorithm to be used to protect for MAP messages.  Requests for
   new Transform Identifiers must be accompanied by a 3GPP Technical
   Specification describing the use of the algorithm within the MAPSEC
   DOI framework.

   The values 249-255 are reserved for private use between cooperating
   systems.

Internet-Draft                 MAPSEC DOI                     March 2004


7.4 MAPSEC Security Association Attributes

   The MAPSEC Security Association Attribute consists of a 16-bit type
   definition and its associated value.  MAPSEC SA attributes are used
   to pass miscellaneous values between ISAKMP peers.  Requests for new
   MAPSEC SA attributes must be accompanied by a 3GPP Technical
   Specification describing the attribute semantics, its type encoding
   (Basic/Variable-Length) and its legal values.  Section 4.5 of this
   document provides an example of such a description.

   The values 32001-32767 are reserved for private use between
   cooperating systems.

   Requests for new values for existing attributes must be accompanied
   also by a 3GPP Technical Specification.  Such specifications describe
   the semantics of the new values.

7.5 MAPSEC Identification Type

   The MAPSEC Identification Type is an 8-bit value which is used as a
   discriminant for the interpretation of the variable-length
   Identification Payload.  Requests for new Identification Types must
   be accompanied by a 3GPP Technical Specification which describes how
   to use the identification type.

   The values 249-255 are reserved for private use between cooperating
   systems.
