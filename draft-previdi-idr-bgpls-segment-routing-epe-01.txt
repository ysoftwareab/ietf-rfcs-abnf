        Segment Routing Egress Peer Engineering BGPLS Extensions
             draft-previdi-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe-01

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages source routing.  A node steers a
   packet through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by
   prepending the packet with an SR header.  A segment can represent any
   instruction, topological or service-based.  SR allows to enforce a
   flow through any topological path and service chain while maintaining
   per-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain.

   The Segment Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS
   dataplane with no change on the forwarding plane.  It requires minor
   extension to the existing link-state routing protocols.

   This document outline a BGPLS extension for exporting BGP egress
   point topology information (including its peers, interfaces and
   peering ASs) in a way that is exploitable in order to compute
   efficient Egress Point Engineering policies and strategies.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages source routing.  A node steers a
   packet through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by
   prepending the packet with an SR header.  A segment can represent any
   instruction, topological or service-based.  SR allows to enforce a
   flow through any topological path and service chain while maintaining
   per-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain.

   The Segment Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS
   dataplane with no change on the forwarding plane.  It requires minor
   extension to the existing link-state routing protocols.

   This document outline a BGPLS extension for exporting BGP egress
   point topology information (including its peers, interfaces and
   peering ASs) in a way that is exploitable in order to compute
   efficient Egress Point Engineering policies and strategies.

2.  Segment Routing Documents

   The main reference for this document is the SR architecture defined
   in [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing].

   The Segment Routing Egress Peer Engineering architecture is described
   in [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-central-epe].

3.  BGP Peering Segments

   As defined in [draft-filsfils-spring-segment-routing-epe], an EPE
   enabled Egress PE node MAY advertise segments corresponding to its
   attached peers.  These segments are called BGP peering segments or
   BGP Peering SIDs.  They enable the expression of source-routed inter-
   domain paths.

   An ingress border router of an AS may compose a list of segments to
   steer a flow along a selected path within the AS, towards a selected
   egress border router C of the AS and through a specific peer.  At
   minimum, a BGP Peering Engineering policy applied at an ingress PE
   involves two segments: the Node SID of the chosen egress PE and then
   the BGP Peering Segment for the chosen egress PE peer or peering
   interface.

   This document defines the BGP EPE Peering Segments: Peer Node, Peer
   Adjacency and Peer Set.

4.  Peer NLRI-Type

   This section described a new NLRI-Type in the BGP-LS specification
   ([I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution]).  The new NLRI-Type (codepoint to be
   assigned by IANA) is called the Peer NLRI-Type and describes the
   connectivity of a BGP Egress router.

   The use of a new NLRI-Type allows to separate and differentiate the
   NLRIs carrying BGP-EPE descriptors from the NLRIs carrying IGP link-
   state information as defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution].  The
   Peer NLRI Type uses descriptors and attributes already defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] in addition to new TLVs defined in the
   following sections of this document.

   The format of the Peer NLRI Type is as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   |                           Identifier                          |
   |                            (64 bits)                          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   //      Local Node Descriptors                                 //
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   //      Remote Node Descripttors                               //
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   //      Link Descriptors                                       //
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        Table 1: Summary Table of BGPLS-EPE TLV/Sub-TLV Codepoints

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines:

      Two new Node Descriptors Sub-TLVs: BGP-Router-ID and BGP
      Confederation Member.

      A New NLRI Type for EPE: Peer Type NLRI.

      A new BGPLS Attribute Sub-TLV: the Peer Set SID.

   The code points are to be assigned by IANA.

9.  Manageability Considerations

   TBD

10.  Security Considerations

   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] defines BGPLS NLRIs to which the
   extensions defined in this document apply.

   The Security Section of [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] also applies
   to the:

      new NLRI-Type: Peer NLRI;

      new Node Descriptors Sub-TLVs: BGP-Router ID and BGP Confederation
      Member;

      Peer NLRI-Type;

      Peer Set SID attribute

   defined in this document.
