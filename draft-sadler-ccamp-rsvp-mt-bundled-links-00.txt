Abstract 
    
   When operating a multi-domain network, it is quite common for a 
   domain to have a number of border-nodes that end up with a large 
   number of connections between them using the same path.  While 
   support for LSP stitching has removed the need to maintain the data 
   associated with each end-to-end session (e.g. Sender Template and 
   Session object data) within the domain, the mechanisms used by GMPLS 
   RSVP-TE to support out-of-band signaling still force individual 
   sessions to be used between the border nodes for each connection. 
   This has a negative impact on intermediate nodes, as it increases 
   the amount of RSVP processing and memory required. 
    
   This document details a method for GMPLS RSVP-TE to use a common 
   session for an edge-to-edge LSP supporting multiple data-plane 
   connections between border nodes.

1. Overview  
    
   When operating a multi-domain network, it is common for some domains 
   to have a number of border-nodes with a large number of connections 
   between them using the same path.  It is desirable to support these 
   connections with as few sessions within the domain as possible due 
   to the load generated on intermediate nodes by each session.  LSP 
   stitching [RFC5150] has removed the need to maintain the data 
   associated with end-to-end sessions (e.g. Sender Template and 
   Session objects) within the domain.  However, there are other issues 
   that prevent the edge-to-edge LSP to support multiple connections. 
    
   RSVP [RFC2205] allows for session merging, enabling a set of 
   endpoints involved in communications with common traffic 
   characteristics to share a common session. Addition/Removal of 
   endpoints does not require additional sessions to be established or

   the overall session to be removed - the existing session can be 
   resized, either increasing or decreasing the number of resources 
   requested, to accommodate the changes in bandwidth required.  The 
   result is intermediate nodes have a reduced number sessions 
   operating through them, with lower CPU processing and memory 
   required. 
    
   The mechanisms in RFC 2205 work well given the packet nature of the 
   links being controlled -- packets from different connections can be 
   interleaved without restriction while being associated with the same 
   RSVP-TE session.  GMPLS RSVP-TE [RFC3473] provides a similar 
   capability by providing a list of labels to name the multiple data-
   plane connections covered by a session.  However, problems are 
   encountered when out-of-band signaling extensions and bundled links 
   are used with LSPs requesting multiple signals. 
    
   To support this scenario, methods and extensions need to be defined 
   for bundled link operations.

3. Requirements and Analysis of existing protocols 
    
3.1.     Requirements 
    
   The signaling protocol must be able to: 
    
   1) Allow for multiple data-plane connections to be delivered using a 
      single session without requiring contiguous TDM resources on a 
      link. 
    
   2) Allow for resizing of a session between a pair of border nodes to 
      increase the number of data-plane connections in use 
    
   3) Allow for use of paths that utilize links realized by a single 
      physical link 
    
   4) Allow for use of paths that utilize links realized by a group of 
      physical links (i.e. Bundled links [RFC 4201]) 
    
   5) Allow for connections to be spread over the component links that 
      make up a bundled link

3.2.     Analysis 
    
   Current GMPLS encodings for SONET/SDH [RFC 4606] and OTN [RFC 4328] 
   allow for multiple data-plane connections to be established by a 
   single control plane session.  This is provided by the Multiplier 
   (MT) field in the SENDER_TSPEC.  When this field has a value greater 
   than one, the downstream node will provide an "explicit ordered list 
   of all labels that take part in the Final Signal."  This list names 
   each of the data-plane resources used for the data-plane 
   connections. 
    
   GMPLS extensions to enable out-of-band operation state the label 
   returned is within the context of the interface identified by the 
   RSVP_HOP object.  At this time, the RSVP_HOP object is limited to 
   identifying a single link for downstream traffic and (optionally) a 
   single link for upstream traffic [RFC 4201].  The content of TLVs in 
   the RSVP_HOP object is either the identifier for a non-bundled link, 
   or a component link within a bundle. 
    
   Because of the limitation to a single link in the RSVP_HOP object's 
   TLVs, data-plane connections carried over a bundled link are limited 
   to a single component link. This has two ramifications: 
    
   1) Setup of a connection with a multiplier (MT) greater than 1 may 
   specify use of a bundled link where the bundle has adequate 
   resources to satisfy the request, but the individual component links 
   do not.  Due to the protocol limitation to a single component link, 
   the connections cannot be spread across the bundled link's 
   components, and the request ends up failing for lack of available 
   bandwidth. 
    
   2) A request to resize an existing RSVP session may be received by 
   an intermediate node where the bundle has adequate resources to 
   satisfy the request, but a component link does not.  Again, this 
   request will fail for lack of available bandwidth. 
    
   In short, all requirements specified in section 3.1 can be met with 
   the exception of requirement 5. 
    
4. Methods for Implementation and protocol extensions 
    
4.1.     Operation over single physical links 
    
   No specific extension is required for operation over a single 
   physical link.  The multiplier (MT) field states the required number 
   of data-plane resources, and all label-related objects (i.e. 
   UPSTREAM_LABEL and LABEL) contain a list of labels to satisfy the 
   request.

4.2.     Operation over multiple physical (Bundled) links 
4.2.1   Method 
    
   When operating over bundled links, the resources requested may be 
   delivered on a single component link or may be delivered on using 
   multiple component links.  When a single component link is used, the 
   existing encoding required by RFC 4201 is utilized, with a single 
   set of TLVs identifying the upstream and downstream components. 
    
   However, when use of more than one component link is identified by 
   the upstream node, the RSVP_HOP object sent to the downstream node 
   needs to contain multiple TLVs to identify the downstream and 
   upstream interfaces used.  These interfaces identified in the TLVs 
   have the same order as the labels in the UPSTREAM_LABEL object and 
   the returned LABEL object.  The specifics for how this encoded is 
   described in the next section. 
    
4.2.2   Protocol Extension 
    
   Two protocol extensions are proposed for the RSVP_HOP object.  The 
   first provides a simple interface list encoding for TLVs while the 
   second provides for Run-length encoding. 
    
4.2.2.1 Interface List Encoding in RSVP_HOP TLVs 
    
   The existing RSVP_HOP encoding utilizes one or two TLVs in sequence, 
   where the sequence is described by: 
    
   <RSVP_HOP_TLVs> ::= <Downstream interface> [ <Upstream interface> ] 
    
   The proposed extension utilizes the sequence: 
    
   <RSVP_HOP_TLVs> ::= <TLV_interfaces>+ 
   <TLV_interfaces> ::= <Downstream interface> [ <Upstream interface> ] 
    
   For a unidirectional connection, identified by the lack of an 
   UPSTREAM_LABEL object in the message, the Upstream interface is not 
   provided. 
    
   For a bidirectional connection, identified by the presence of an 
   UPSTREAM_LABEL object in the message, the Upstream interface is 
   always provided.  The Upstream interface will repeat the information 
   in the Downstream interface if the same link is used for both 
   directions. 
    
4.2.2.2 Run-Length Encoded List in RSVP_HOP 
    
   In order to reduce the size of an RSVP message, a Run-length 
   Encoding (RLE) is proposed for use when more than one resource is 
   provided using the same component link.  This requires a new set of 
   RSVP_HOP TLVs which include the number of interface instances 
   represented by the appearance of the TLV. 
    
  
Sadler, Shen           CCAMP WG - October 2009                [Page 5]
          draft-sadler-ccamp-rsvp-mt-bundled-links-00     October 2009 
 
 
   Appearance of an RLE TLV in the RSVP_HOP object is the equivalent of 
   the same number of upstream or downstream TLVs appearing in the 
   RSVP_HOP object. 
    
   Note: The RLE TLV does not cross the implied upstream/downstream TLV 
   boundary.  This means an even number of RLE TLVs must be utilized 
   for bidirectional connections. 
    
   Each of the new RLE TLV formats includes a run-length field which 
   indicates the number of single-interface TLV instances being 
   represented by the RLE TLV.  A run-length of 0 is undefined -- a TLV 
   received with a run-length of 0 MUST be ignored.  The run-length 
   SHOULD be 2 or more.
