      Multi link PPP Support for an ipv6 address class identifier
                  draft-vautrin-6man-ipv6-mlppp-id-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a new multi link protocol address class
   identifier.  This new class will be able to contain an ipv6 address.

Internet-Draft                IPv6 MLPPP ID                  August 2010


1.  Introduction

   RFC 1990 [RFC1990] defines 6 different classes in its Endpoint
   Discriminator Option (from Class 0 to class 5).  If a Multilink PPP
   is created in an ipv6 environment it would be possible to use the
   Class 1 address space and place the IPv6 address there as the MLPPP
   session ID.  But the Class 1 has been deprecated and is thus not the
   right vehicle for an ipv6 address.  This document propose the
   creation of a class 6 dedicated to ipv6 addresses.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  New IPv6 Endpoint Discriminator address class

   Per RFC 1990 [RFC1990], the Endpoint Discriminator Option is defined
   as such:



       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   Type = 19   |     Length    |    Class      |  Address ...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Endpoint Discriminator Option represents identification of the
      system transmitting the packet.

      The specification of the subfields are:

      Type
           19 = for Endpoint Discriminator

      Length
           3 + length of Address

      Class
           The Class field is one octet and indicates the identifier
           address space. Current values are assigned as follows:

           0    Null Class

           1    Locally Assigned Address

           2    Internet Protocol (IPv4) Address

           3    IEEE 802.1 Globally Assigned MAC Address

           4    PPP Magic-Number Block

           5    Public Switched Network Directory Number

   This document defines a new class of endpoint discreminator address:


           6    Internet Protocol (IPv6) Address defined as:

           Class 6 - Internet Protocol (IPv6) Address

                Fixed Length: 16

                Content:


   An address in this class contains an IPv6 host address as defined in
   RFC 2460 [RFC2460].
