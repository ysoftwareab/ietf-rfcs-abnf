Abstract

   This document defines the syntax and the semantics of SDP parameters
   needed to support features of H.261  and H.263 video codecs.  This
   optional parameters enables the H.261 and H.263 codecs to specify
   their functionality enabling better video support.  The document
   specify codec specific parameters that can be used with SIP, SAP or
   any similar protocol that uses SDP to signal support of those codecs.

Internet-Draft               H263/1 codecs                  October 2003


1. Introduction

   Internet multimedia conferencing is picking up with point-to-point
   and multipoint video conferencing implementations.  The common video
   codecs that are used in video conferencing applications include
   H.261[3] and the basic H.263 with its two revisions from  1998 and
   2000[4].  The current usage of H.261[3] and H.263[4] is limited since
   the current SDP MIME types defined in RFC3555 [6] are defining only
   part of the functionality needed.

   This document specifies the SDP syntax and the semantics for
   describing the optional H.261 and H.263 features.  The syntax in this
   document uses the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute which is meant to carry
   codec specific parameters.  These codec specific parameters can be
   used with SIP[1],  SAP[2] or any similar protocol that uses SDP to
   signal support of those codecs.

2. H.261 Codec Parameters

   For further description of these H.261 parameters refer to the ITU
   H.261 document[3].

   The fmtp parameters for H.261 are represented in the SDP attribute.

   a=fmtp:xx H261_option

   The xx is the RTP payload number, it  can be a static or dynamic
   payload number.  The recommendation is to use dynamic payload number.

   The syntax of H261_option is

   H261_option = *Size SP | *Annex SP

   Size = "QCIF"  "="  "mpi | "CIF" "=" mpi

   mpi = 1*2DIGIT

   Annex = "D"

   The Size parameter specifies the picture size supported and at what
   frame rate.  H.261 defines two resolution QCIF and CIF.

   mpi is an integer value (1..4) and it means the maximum picture frame
   rate is (29.97/mpi) frames/sec.  The definition of the mpi is
   according to the video codec specification.

   Annex D specifies support for still image graphics according to H.261
   annex D.

3. H.263 Codec Parameters

   H.263 has three MIME types defined in RFC3555.  The parameters in
   this section may be used with any of the H263 MIME types.  When used
   with H.263-2000 MIME subtype name, the optional parameters profile
   and levels must not be used.  For description of these H.263
   parameters refer to the ITU H.263 document[4].

   The fmtp parameters for H.263 are represented in the SDP attribute.

   a=fmtp:xx H263_option

   The xx is the RTP payload number, it  can be a static or dynamic
   payload number.  The recommendation is to use dynamic payload number.

   The syntax of H263_option is

   H263_option = *Size SP | *Annex SP | *Params

   Size = "SQCIF"  "="  "mpi | "QCIF" "=" mpi | "CIF" "=" mpi |

   "CIF4" "=" mpi I "CIF16" "=" mpi |

   "XMAX" "=" xmax SP "YMAX" "=" ymax SP "MPI" "=" mpi

   mpi = 1*2DIGIT

   xmax=1*4DIGIT

   ymax=1*4DIGIT

   The Size parameter specifies the picture size supported and at what
   frame rate.  H.263 defines fixed resolution SQCIF, QCIF, CIF, 4xCIF
   and 16xCIF as well as custom picture size that are presented by their
   maximum X and Y size.  The X and Y values must be dividable by 4.

   mpi is an integer value (1..32) and it means the maximum picture
   frame rate is (29.97/mpi) frames/sec.  The definition of the mpi is
   according to the video codec specification.

   Annex = "D" "=" #annex_d | "E" | "F" | "G" | "I" | "J" |

   "K" "=" #annex_k | "L" "=" #annex_l | "M" | "N" "=" annex_n |

   "O" "=" #annex_o | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T"

   annex_d= "1" | "2"

   annex_k= "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"

   annex_l= "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7"

   annex_n= "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"

   annex_o= "1" | "2" | "3"

   Here #term means comma separated list of term.

   The H.263 parameters that can be specified are in the Params options.

   Params= "PAR" "=" par_a ":" par_b | "CPCF" "=" cpcf | "MaxBR" "="
   maxbr |

   "BPP" "=" bpp | "HRD" | "Interlaced"

   par_a=1*3DIGIT

   par_b=1*DIGIT

   cpcf=1*2DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT

   maxbr=1*5DIGIT

   bpp=1*5DIGIT

   Explanations:

   Arbitrary Pixel Aspect Ratio (PAR):

   Par_a and par_b are integers between 0 and 255.

   Default ratio is 12:11 if not otherwise specified.

   Arbitrary (Custom) Picture Clock Frequency (CPCF):

   Cpcf is floating point value.  Default value is 29.97.

   MaxBitRate (MaxBR):

   Maximum video stream bitrate, presented with units of 100 bits/s.
   MaxBR value is an integer between 1..19200.

   BitsPerPictureMaxKb (BPP):

   Maximum amount of kilobits allowed to represent a single picture
   frame, value is specified by largest supported picture resolution,

   see [1].  If this parameter is not present, then default value, that
   is based on the maximum supported resolution, is used.  BPP is
   integer value between 0 and 65536.

   Hypothetical Reference Decoder (HRD):

   See annex B of H.263 specification.

   Interlaced or 60 fields indicates the support for interlace display
   according to H.263 annex W.6.3.11

   These parameters are separated by space.

4. Usage of SDP H.261 and H.263 options with SIP

   This document does not specify actual SIP signaling.  The decoder
   send its preferred parameters and let the other end select according
   to SIP procedures.  This syntax may be sent, for example, with SIP
   INVITE and corresponding status response (200 ok).  Other SIP methods
   may be used.

   Codec options: (D,E,F,G,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T) These characters
   exist only if the sender of this SDP message is able or willing to
   decode those.  E.g.  If a terminal is capable of decoding Syntax
   based Arithmetic Coding (SAC) and Advanced Prediction (AP) options,
   it can put E F in the end of the format specific parameters.

   Picture sizes and MPI:

   Supported picture sizes and their corresponding minimum picture
   interval (MPI) information for H.261 and H.263 can be combined.  All
   picture sizes can be advertised to other party, or only some subset
   of it.  Terminal announces only those picture sizes (with their MPIs)
   which it is willing to receive.  For example, MPI=2 means that
   maximum (decodeable) picture rate per second is about 15.

   Parameters occurring first are the most preferred picture mode to be
   received.

   Example of the usage of these parameters:

   CIF=4  QCIF=3 SQCIF=2 XMAX=360 YMAX=240 MPI=2

   This means that sender hopes to receive CIF picture size, which it
   can decode at MPI=4.  If that is not possible, then QCIF with MPI
   value 3, if that is neither possible, then SQCIF with MPI value =2.
   It is also allowed (but least preferred) to send arbitrary picture
   sizes (max 360x240) with MPI=2.  Note that most encoders support at

Internet-Draft               H263/1 codecs                  October 2003


   least QCIF and CIF fixed resolutions and they are expected to be
   available almost in every H.261 and H.263 based video application.

   MaxBR and BPP parameters:

   Both these parameters are useful in SIP.  MaxBitRate is video decoder
   property, hence it differs from SDP b : bandwidth-value attribute
   which refers more to application's total bandwidth (an application
   consists often of both audio and video).

   BitsPerPictureMaxKb is needed especially for decoder buffer size
   estimation to reduce the probability of video buffer overflow.

   Below is an example of H.263 SDP syntax in SIP message.

   a=fmtp: xx CIF=4 QCIF=2 MaxBR=1000 E F

   This means that the sender of this message can decode H.263 bit
   stream with following options and parameters: Preferred resolution is
   CIF (its MPI is 4), but if that is not possible then QCIF size is ok.
   Maximum receivable bitrate is 100 kbit/s (1000*100 bit/s) and SAC and
   AP options can be used.

5. Use of SDP H.263 and H.261 options with SAP

   SAP announcements are one-way only.  All H.263/H.261 options can be
   used to signal that the sending terminal is going to use these
   options in its transmitted video stream.  It is just an informal
   message.

   Usually only one picture size (with its MPI) exists.  However, since
   it is possible for a video source (terminal) to change its picture
   size during session, several picture sizes can exist in the parameter
   list.  First one is the original picture size to be used in the
   beginning of the session.

6. Security Considerations

   The security for these features are the same as for SDP.
