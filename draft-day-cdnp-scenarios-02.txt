1. Introduction

   This document presents several logical scenarios which are intended
   to describe the potential configurations that can be realized when
   peering CDNs. These logical scenarios describe how various entities
   may combine to provide a complete CDN solution. These scenarios
   answer two distinct needs:

   1.  To provide some concrete examples of what CDN peering is, and

   2.  To provide a basis for evaluating CDN peering proposals.

   Each of the logical peering scenarios gives an indication of how the
   various CDN peering systems can be combined. From [2] these peering
   systems are:

   1.  DIRECTION PEERING SYSTEM

   2.  DISTRIBUTION PEERING SYSTEM

   3.  ACCOUNTING PEERING SYSTEM

   The peering scenarios presented in this document are also framed by
   the following concepts:

   1.  CONTENT Has Value

   2.  DISTRIBUTION Has Value

   3.  CLIENTS Have Value

   Scenarios that reference the above concepts are given within this
   document in an effort to describe some of the currently known
   business models. These descriptions are intended to provide
   guidelines for developing the requirements given in [3].

   Terms in ALL CAPS are defined in [1].

2. Logical Peering Scenarios

   This section provides several logical peering scenarios that may
   arise in peered CDN implementations.

2.1 Expanding Existing CDN Footprint

   This scenario considers the case where two or more existing CDNs
   wish to peer and exchange content in order to provide an increased
   scale and reach for their existing customers. It assumes that all of
   these CDNs already provide REDIRECTION, DISTRIBUTION, and ACCOUNTING
   services and that they will continue to provide these services to
   existing customers as well as offering them to their peers.

   In this scenario these CDNs would be interconnected via a CDN
   PEERING GATEWAY which provides a DIRECTION PEERING SYSTEM, a
   DISTRIBUTION PEERING SYSTEM, and an ACCOUNTING PEERING SYSTEM. The
   net result of this peering would be that a larger set of SURROGATES
   will now be available to the CLIENTs.

   FIGURE 1 shows three CDNs which have peered to provide greater scale
   and reach to their existing customers. They are all participating
   in; DISTRIBUTION PEERING, DIRECTION PEERING, and ACCOUNTING PEERING.

   As a result of these peering relationships it is assumed that:

   1.  CONTENT that has been injected into any one of these CDNs
       (ORIGIN CDN) MAY be distributed into any peered DISTRIBUTING CDN

   2.  Commands affecting the distribution of CONTENT MAY originate
       within the ORIGIN CDN or MAY be issued within the DISTRIBUTING
       CDN

   3.  Accounting information regarding CLIENT access and/or
       DISTRIBUTION actions will be made available to the ORIGIN CDN by
       the DISTRIBUTING CDN

   4.  The ORIGIN CDN would provide this accounting information to the
       PUBLISHER based on existing Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

   5.  Requests by CLIENTS MAY be directed to SURROGATES within any of
       the peered CDNs

   The decision of where to direct an individual CLIENT request MAY be
   dependent upon the DISTRIBUTION and DIRECTION policies associated
   with the CONTENT being requested as well as the specific algorithms
   and methods used for directing these requests.

   It is also worthwhile to consider that any one of these peered CDNs

   may also have other peering arrangements which may or may not be
   transitive to peering relationships created for the above purpose.

NOTE:

   The above FIGURE 1 does not illustrate the CLIENT REQUEST path. It
   is assumed that the DIRECTION of CLIENT requests follows the
   methodology given in [2] and that the end result is that the peered
   DIRECTION SYSTEMs return the IP address of the SURROGATE deemed
   appropriate to honor the CLIENT's REQUEST.

2.2 ACCOUNTING and REQUEST DIRECTION Across Multiple DISTIBUTING CDNs

   This scenario describes the case where a single entity (ORG
   A)performs ACCOUNTING and DIRECTION functions but has no inherent
   DISTRIBUTION capabilities. This entity must therefore peer with one
   or more DISTRIBUTING CDNs in order to provide a complete solution. A
   potential configuration which illustrates this concept is given in
   FIGURE 2.

   In the scenario shown in FIGURE 2, ORG A is responsible for
   collecting ACCOUNTING information from multiple CDNs (CDN A, and CDN
   B) and providing a "clearing house"/reconciliation function as well
   as providing a REQUEST DIRECTION service across the peered CDNs.

   In this scenario, CONTENT is injected into one of the peered CDNs
   and its DISTRIBUTION between these peered CDNs is controlled via the
   DISTRIBUTION PEERING SYSTEMs within the peered CPGs. The REQUEST
   DIRECTION system provided by ORG A is informed of the ability to
   serve a piece of CONTENT from a particular CDN by the DIRECTION
   PEERING SYSTEMs within the peered CPGs.

   ORG A collects statistics and usage information via the ACCOUNTING
   PEERING SYSTEM and disseminates that information to its peers as
   appropriate. 

   As illustrated in FIGURE 2, there may be multiple DIRECTION systems
   employed within the peered CDNs. If the DIRECTION SYSTEM provided by
   ORG A is the AUTHORITATIVE DIRECTION SYSTEM for a given CONTENT DATA
   UNIT this is not a problem. However, the individual CDNs may also
   provide the AUTHORITATIVE DIRECTION SYSTEM for some portion of its
   existing customers. In this case care must be taken to insure that
   the tree structure remains intact (i.e. there is one and only one
   DIRECTION tree for a given CONTENT object).

   Also, it should be noted that FIGURE 2 does not illustrate the fact
   that ACCOUNTING PEERING and DIRECTION PEERING MAY also exist between
   CDN A and CDN B.

   ORG A could also play an active role in managing the DISTRIBUTION.
   In this case an additional DISTRIBUTION PEERING relationships are
   required.

   As in the previous diagram (FIGURE 1), the communication path(s)
   between the CLIENT and the REQUEST DIRECTION SYSTEM have been
   omitted in order to better illustrate the peering connections. It
   should be noted that FIGURE 2 also omits the (optional) DISTRIBUTION
   PEERING connection which MAY be implemented between ORG A and any or
   all of the peered CDNs.

   It is also worthwhile to consider that any one of these peered
   entities may also have other peering arrangements which may or may
   not be transitive to peering relationships created for the above
   purpose.

2.3 ACCOUNTING PEERING Across Multiple DISTRIBUTING CDNs

   This scenario describes the case where a single ACCOUNTING SYSTEM
   (ORG A) provides a settlement/clearing-house function and wishes to
   peer w/multiple DISTRIBUTING CDNs. For the purposes of this scenario
   it is not necessary to consider the specifics of REQUEST DIRECTION
   PEERING.

   In this scenario the entity which operates the ACCOUNTING SYSTEM
   would enter into ACCOUNTING PEERING relationships w/one or more
   DISTRIBUTING CDNs as shown in FIGURE 3.

   In this scenario, the DISTRIBUTION of CONTENT and the DIRECTION of
   CLIENT REQUESTs are controlled via the DISTRIBUTION PEERING SYSTEMs
   and REQUEST DIRECTION PEERING SYSTEMs within the peered CPGs. These
   systems MAY be decoupled from the ACCOUNTING or they may use
   information obtained via an optional ACCOUNTING PEERING relationship
   between CDN A and CDN B.

   As in the previous diagrams, the communication path(s) between the
   CLIENT and the REQUEST DIRECTION SYSTEM have been omitted in order
   to better illustrate the peering connections.

   It is also worthwhile to consider that any one of these peered
   entities may also have other peering arrangements which may or may
   not be transitive to peering relationships created for the above
   purpose.

2.4 PUBLISHER peers w/multiple DISTRIBUTING CDNs

   This scenario, shown in FIGURE 4 describes the case where a
   PUBLISHER wishes to directly enter into peering relationships
   w/multiple DISTRIBUTING CDNs.

   In this scenario the PUBLISHER would operate its own CPG and enter
   into; DISTRIBUTION PEERING, ACCOUNTING PEERING, and REDIRECTION
   peering with one or more DISTRIBUTING CDNs.

   FIGURE 4 assumes that the PUBLISHER operates as the
   FIRST-REDIRECTION SYSTEM for its CONTENT although it is possible
   that this function may be designated to one of the DISTRIBUTING
   CDNs. If this delegation occurs then it is not necessary for the
   PUBLISHER to have an REQUEST DIRECTION PEERING relationship to the
   DISTRIBUTING CDNs.

   It likely that a PUBLISHER may also wish to use a third party to
   perform ACCOUNTING and BILLING. In that case there is no need for an
   ACCOUNTING PEERING relationship between the PUBLISHER's CPG and
   those of the DISTRIBUTING CDNs.

   Likewise, it is possible that the PUBLISHER may only be interested
   in obtaining additional control over the DISTRIBUTION of its
   CONTENT. In that case, the only peering relationship that would be
   required between the PUBLISHER's CPG and those of the DISTRIBUTING
   CDNs would be a DISTRIBUTION PEERING relationship.

   As in the previous diagrams, the communication path(s) between the
   CLIENT and the REQUEST DIRECTION SYSTEM have been omitted in order
   to better illustrate the peering connections.

   It is also worthwhile to consider that any one of these peered

   not be transitive to peering relationships created for the above

3. Accounting

   There are several concepts that are helpful to consider when
   attempting to model the various accounting scenarios that can be
   realized when peering CDNs. The most fundamental of these is the
   assignment of value within the distribution exchange.

   In any distribution system, revenue will generally flow in the
   direction of value. In order to insure that this revenue flows
   accurately, it is necessary to provide accurate statistical and
   access related information to one or more BILLING or ACCOUNTING
   organizations. In general it can be assumed that accounting
   information originates within the DISTRIBUTING CDNs and flows
   towards the BILLING/ACCOUNTING organizations. However it is entirely
   appropriate to consider that this data may flow through one or more
   aggregation points. In fact the ability to aggregate statistical and
   access related information is essential to allow for scalability
   within the proposed solution. 

   It should be noted that value exists at many points in a peered
   DISTRIBUTION system. To fully consider this problem one should
   assume that, in general, any element of the DISTRIBUTION system
   could have an assigned value associated with its use. This raises
   some obvious questions about settlement that are outside the scope
   of this document. A more detailed description of these requirements
   is contained within [3]. For the purposes of this effort it is
   sufficient to insure that the appropriate accounting data is capable
   of being transferred from the measurement point to the
   BILLING/ACCOUNTING system.

3.1 Key Assumptions

   The distribution of accounting information, like the distribution of
   content, is greatly affected by the following concepts.

3.1.1 Content Has Value

   This concept assumes that the content has intrinsic value and that
   the revenue (and ACCOUNTING information) flows from the consumer to
   the CONTENT PROVIDER. A consumer, as defined in this relationship,
   is the entity that consumes data. Therefore the consumer may be a
   CLIENT or a SURROGATE.

   An example of this concept would include services such as Video On
   Demand (VOD).

3.1.2 Distribution Has Value

   This concept describes the situation where the value is located


Day & Gilletti            Expires May 9, 2001                  [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                   CDNPS                     November 2000


   within the CDN service being provided. In this case the revenue as
   well as the statistical and access information flow toward the CDN
   that provides the service. (NOTE: There may be other ACCOUNTING
   flows in addition to the one described.)

   When considering this case, it is a reasonable assumption to
   consider that the majority of the statistical and access information
   would be produced and consumed within the CDN service provider's
   domain and is therefore not important to consider. However, it is
   not reasonable to assume that all such information is obtained in
   this manner. The latter is especially true when a third-party
   BILLING ORGANIZATION or complex peering arrangements are in place.

   An example of this case is where a service provider has an
   aggregated CLIENT population which is of sufficient interest to one
   or more PUBLISHERs. In this case the PUBLISHERs are willing to pay
   to access the CLIENTs of the service provider and revenue flows from
   the PUBLISHER to the service provider.

3.2 Accounting Scenarios

   There are four basic conceptual accounting scenarios that SHOULD be
   considered when describing the requirements for the peering of
   accounting events between peered distribution entities:[Editor's
   Note: Other models suitable for real-time provisioning may be added
   to this proposal over time.]

   o  Flat Rate Accounting Scenario - (aka "The Cable Scenario)

   o  Metered Accounting Scenario - (aka "The Telco Scenario")

   o  Prepay Event Accounting Scenario - (aka "The Ticket Scenario")

   o  Prepay Metered Accounting Scenario - (aka "The Calling Card
      Scenario")

   These scenarios are described in the following sections.

3.2.1 The Cable Scenario

   In this scenario there is a "subscription" fee associated with the
   reception of CONTENT. In its primary mode it consists of a CLIENT
   entering into a transaction, either directly with the CONTENT
   PROVIDER or through some third party, for the purposes of obtaining
   access to one or more CONTENT objects. Once the transaction has been
   approved the CLIENT receives an entitlement to access the requested
   CONTENT for the duration of the subscription interval.

   An extension to this scenario is the case where a given DISTRIBUTING


Day & Gilletti            Expires May 9, 2001                  [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                   CDNPS                     November 2000


   CDN enters into a redistribution agreement with a CONTENT PROVIDER.
   In this scenario, the scope of the transaction is between the
   CONTENT PROVIDER and the specific DISTRIBUTION CDN. Once the
   transaction is successful, the DISTRIBUTION CDN obtains the right to
   redistribute that content in some mutually agreed upon manner. The
   manner of redistribution can range from unlimited to highly
   restricted.

   The resultant accounting information for this scenario consists of a
   single transaction which is associated with a specific consumer or
   CLIENT.

3.2.2 The Telco Scenario

   This scenario associates a finite value with the access or
   consumption of one or more CONTENT objects and attempts to fully
   control and/or account for access to this CONTENT.

   The resultant accounting information for this scenario is a set of
   detailed or summary accounting records associated with a specific
   CLIENT.

3.2.3 The Ticket Scenario

   In this scenario the CLIENT obtains a ticket (or entitlement) in
   advance of accessing the CONTENT. This is accomplished by a
   transaction between the CLIENT and the PUBLISHER or their agent(s).
   The ticket is assumed to be a one-time entitlement which expires
   upon use.

3.2.4 The Calling Card Scenario

   In this scenario a CLIENT prepays and receives an entitlement to
   access a set of CONTENT OBJECTS up to some pre-specified value
   level. The total value of the entitlement is determined at the time
   of purchase and its value is decremented each time the CLIENT
   accesses the CONTENT or CDN service. The amount of the decrement
   will be specific to the CONTENT or CDN service being accessed. The
   CLIENT is able to continue accessing or consuming the CONTENT or CDN
   service until the entitlement is fully depleted.

4. Security Considerations

   This document describes scenarios for use in evaluating CDN peering
   proposals. As such, it does not propose any solutions which might
   have security concerns.

   This document assumes that any peering solutions which are derived
   within the context of Content Alliance effort will be compliant with
   the trust model given in [4].
