    1. Summary of SIP usage of Offer/Answer Model 

       Offer/answer model itself is independent from the higher layer 
       application protocols which utilize it. SIP is one of the 
       applications using offer/answer model. In RFC 3264 [4], which defines 
       offer/answer model, which SIP message should convey an offer or an 
       answer is not defined. This should be defined in the SIP core and 
       extensions RFCs. 

       In theory, any SIP message can include session description in its 
       body. But not all the session description in a SIP message is an 
       offer or an answer. Only the session description that conforms to the 
       rules described in the standard track RFCs can be interpreted as an

       offer or an answer. The rules how to handle offer/answer model are 
       currently defined in several RFCs. Unless defined in an RFC 
       explicitly as an offer or an answer, except ones in non-reliable 
       provisional response to INVITE request, a session description should 
       not be included in SIP messages to avoid confusions. 

       Offer/answer model defines the update of sessions. In SIP, dialog is 
       used to match the offer/answer exchange to the session which is to be 
       updated with it. In other words, only the offer/answer exchange in 
       the SIP dialog can update the session which is managed with it. 

    1.1. Offer/Answer Exchange Pairs in SIP Messages 

       Currently, the rules on offer/answer model are defined in RFC 3261, 
       RFC 3262 and RFC 3311. In these RFCs, only the six patterns shown in 
       Table 1 are defined for exchanging an offer and an answer with SIP 
       messages. 

       Note that an offer/answer exchange initiated by an INVITE request 
       must follow exactly one of the patterns 1, 2, 3, 4. Only one of them, 
       one for each dialog if multiple dialogs are created, must occur in an 
       INVITE 3-way handshake process. Pattern 2 and pattern 4 can occur 
       only when INVITE request does not include an offer. 'The first 
       reliable non-failure message' must have an offer if there is no offer 
       in the INVITE request. This means that UA which receives the INVITE 
       request without an offer must include an offer in the first reliable 
       response with 100rel extension. If no reliable provisional response 
       has been sent, UAS must include an offer when sending 2xx response. 

       In pattern 3, the first reliable provisional response may or may not 
       have an answer. When a reliable provisional response contains a 
       session description, and is the first to do so, then that session 
       description is the answer to the offer in the INVITE request. 

       In pattern 5, PRACK request can contain an offer only if the non-
       reliable response which it acknowledges contains an answer in the 
       previous offer/answer exchange.

       In Table 1, '1xx-rel' corresponds to the reliable provisional 
       response which applies 100rel option defined in RFC 3262 [3]. 

       'Ini' column shows the ability to exchange the offer/answer to 
       initiate the session. 'O' indicates that the pattern can be used in 
       the initial offer/answer exchange, while 'X' indicates that it can 
       not. Only the initial INVITE request can be used to exchange the 
       offer/answer to establish multimedia session. 

       'Est' column shows the ability to update the established session. 

       'Early' column shows the ability to be used to modify the established 
       session in an early dialog. There are two ways to exchange subsequent 
       offer/answer in an early dialog. 

    1.2. Rejection against an Offer 

       How to reject an offer when it can not be accepted is not so clear 
       and some method can not allow explicit rejection against an offer. 
       Corresponding to the patterns in Table 1, how to reject an offer is 
       shown in Table 2. 

       When a UA receives an INVITE request with an offer which it can not 
       accept, it should respond with a 488 response preferably with Warning 
       header field indicating the reason of the rejection unless other 
       response code is more appropriate to reject it. (Pattern 1 and 
       Pattern 3) 

       When a UA receives an UPDATE request with an offer which it can not 
       accept, it should respond with a 488 response preferably with Warning 
       header field indicating the reason of the rejection unless other 
       response code is more appropriate to reject it. (Pattern 6) 

       When a UA receives a PRACK request with an offer which it can not 
       accept, it may respond with a 200 response with a syntactically 
       correct session description followed by an UPDATE request possibly to 
       rearrange the session parameters if both ends support UPDATE method. 
       A UA may simply give up continuing the dialog and send error response 
       to INVITE request. (Pattern 5) 

       When a UA receives a response with an offer which it can not accept, 
       a UA does not have the way to reject it explicitly. Therefore, an UA 
       should respond to the offer with the correct session description and 
       rearrange the session parameters by initiating a new offer/answer 
       exchange. (Pattern 2 and Pattern 4)

       (*) UA should only use PRACK to send an offer when it has strong 
       reasons to assume the receiver will accept. 

    1.3. Session Description which is not Offer nor Answer 

       As it is stated, not all the session description in a SIP message is 
       an offer or an answer. For example, SIP can use the session 
       description to describe the capabilities apart from offer/answer 
       exchange. Examples of these messages are 200 OK responses for OPTIONS 
       and 488 responses for INVITE. 

    2. Detailed Discussion on Offer/Answer Model for SIP 

    2.1. Offer/Answer for INVITE method with 100rel extension 

       INVITE method is the basic procedure for offer/answer exchange in SIP. 
       Without 100rel option, the rules are simple as described in RFC 3261 
       [2]. If an INVITE request includes a session description, pattern 1 
       is applied and if an INVITE request does not include a session 
       description, pattern 2 is applied. 

       With 100rel, pattern 3 and pattern 4 are added and this makes the 
       rules complicated. An INVITE request may cause multiple responses. 
       Note that even if both UAs support 100rel extension, not all the 
       provisional responses are sent reliably. Note also that a reliable 
       provisional response is allowed not to include a session description 
       even when UAS does not send the answer yet. Unreliable provisional 
       response may include a session description in its body until an UAC 
       receives the answer, but its session description is not an offer nor 
       an answer. All the session descriptions in the unreliable responses 
       to the INVITE request must be identical to the answer which is 
       included in the reliable response. Session description in an 
       unreliable response that precedes a reliable response can be 
       considered a "preview" of the session description that will be coming, 
       and hence may be treated like an offer or an answer until the actual 
       one arrives.

    2.1.1. INVITE Request with SDP 

       When UAC includes an SDP in the INVITE request as an offer, it 
       expects the answer to be received with one of the reliable responses. 
       Other than that, no offer/answer exchanges can occur in the INVITE 3-
       way handshake process. 

        UAC                   UAS

         | F4   PRACK (no SDP) | |  
         |-------------------->| | UAC must not send a new offer.  
         | F5 2xx PRA (no SDP) | |

         |                     |

         |<--------------------| -  
         | F7   PRACK          | | UAC can send a new offer in a PRACK

         | F9 1xx-rel          | <- SDP should not be included in the  
         |<--------------------|    subsequent 1xx-rel once offer/answer  
         | F10  PRACK          |    has been completed.  
         |-------------------->|  
         | F11 2xx PRA         |  
         |<--------------------|  
         |                     |  
         | F12 2xx INV         | <- SDP should not be included in the final  
         |<--------------------|    response once offer/answer has been  
         | F13    ACK          |    completed.

             Figure 1 Example of Offer/Answer with 100rel Extension (1) 

       For example, in Figure 1, only the SDP in F6 is the answer. The SDP 
       in the non-reliable response (F3) must be the same as the answer in 
       F6 but is not the answer. Receiving F3, UAC should act as if it 
       receives the answer. However, offer/answer exchange is not completed 
       yet and UAC must not send a new offer until it receives the same SDP 
       in the first reliable response, which is the real answer. After

       sending the SDP in F6, UAS must prepare to receive new offer from UAC 
       with an UPDATE request or a PRACK request. 

       UAS should not include an SDP in the responses F9 and F12. However, 
       UAC should prepare to receive an SDP in F9 and/or F12, and just 
       ignore them for the case that the peer does not conform to the 
       recommended implementation. 

    2.1.2. INVITE request without SDP 

       When UAC does not include an SDP in the INVITE request, it expects 
       the offer to be received with the first reliable response. UAC will 
       send the answer in the request to acknowledge the response, i.e. 
       PRACK request for the reliable response. Other than that, no 
       offer/answer exchanges can occur in the INVITE 3-way handshake 
       process.  

       For example, in Figure 2, only the SDP in F3 is the answer. The SDP 
       in the non-reliable response (F2) must be the same as the offer in F3 
       but is not the offer. Receiving F2, UAC can act as if it receives the 
       offer. However, the official offer is not received until it receives 
       the first reliable response. The first reliable response (F3) must 
       include an SDP as an offer. 

       UAS should not include an SDP in the responses F6 and F9. However, 
       UAC should prepare to receive an SDP in F6 and/or F9, and just ignore 
       them for the case that the peer does not conform to the recommended 
       implementation.

    2.2. Offer/Answer Exchange in Early Dialog 

       When both UAs support 100rel extension, they can update the session 
       in the early dialog once the first offer/answer exchange has been 
       completed. 

       From UA sending an INVITE request: 

       UA can send an UPDATE request with a new offer if both ends support 
       UPDATE method. Whether UPDATE method is supported must be declared in 
       Allow header in some prior messages in the dialog. 

       UA can send a PRACK request with a new offer when acknowledging the 
       reliable provisional response with the answer to the offer in the 
       INVITE request. Compared to UPDATE method, using PRACK can save 
       messages to be exchanged between the UAs. However, as a PRACK request 
       should not be rejected, UA is recommended to send a PRACK request 
       only when it has strong reasons to assume the receiver will accept it. 
       For example, the procedure used in precondition extension[6] is the 
       case that a PRACK request should be used for updating the session 
       status in the early dialog.

       From UA receiving an INVITE request: 

       UA can send an UPDATE request with a new offer if both ends support 
       UPDATE method. UAS can not send new offer in the reliable provisional 
       response. So UPDATE method is the only method for UAS to update the 
       early session. 

    2.3. Offer/Answer Exchange in Established Dialog 

       Re-INVITE method and UPDATE method can be used in the established 
       dialog to update the session. 

       UPDATE method is simpler and can save at least one message compared 
       with INVITE method. But both ends must support UPDATE method to use 
       UPDATE. 

       INVITE method needs at least three messages to complete but no 
       extensions are needed. Additionally, INVITE method allows the peer to 
       take time to decide whether it accept session update or not by 
       sending provisional responses. That is, re-INVITE allows the UAS to 
       interact with the user at the peer, while UPDATE needs to be answered 
       automatically by the UAS. It is noted that re-INVITE should be 
       answered immediately unless such a user interaction is needed. 
       Otherwise, some 3pcc flows would break. 

    3. Exceptional Case Handling 

       In RFC 3264 [4], the following restrictions are defined with regard 
       to sending a new offer. 

          "It MUST NOT generate a new offer if it has received an offer 
          which it has not yet answered or rejected. It MUST NOT generate a 
          new offer if it has generated a prior offer for which it has not 
          yet received an answer or a rejection." 

       Assuming that the above rules are guaranteed, there seems to be two 
       possible 'exceptional' cases to be considered in SIP offer/answer 
       usage, which are 'message crossing' case and 'glare' case. One of the 
       reasons why the usage of a SIP method to exchange offer/answer needs 
       to be carefully restricted in the RFCs is to make sure that UA can 
       detect and handle appropriately the 'exceptional' cases to avoid the 
       confusion. 

    3.1. Message Crossing Case Handling 

       When message packets are crossed in the transport network, an offer 
       may reach before the answer for the previous offer/answer exchange as 

     
    Sawada & Kyzivat      Expires December 11, 2006               [Page 9] 
        
    Internet-Draft     SIP Usage of Offer/Answer Model           June 2006 
        

       described in Figure 3. In such a case, UA A must detect the session 
       description of the offer2 is not the answer to the offer1. 

        A                  B  
        |offer1            |  
        |----------------->|  
        |           answer1|  
        |<------\  /-------|  
        |        \/        |  
        |        /\  offer2|  
        |<------/  \-------|  
        
                          Figure 3 Message Crossing Case 

       When offer2 is in an UPDATE request or a re-INVITE request, a session 
       description can never be the answer. Then UA A must reject the 
       message including offer2 with a 500 response with Retry-After header 
       field. 

       When offer2 is in a PRACK request, that is, when PRACK request to 
       acknowledge the reliable provisional response with an answer to the 
       offer in the INVITE request contains a session description, UA A 
       knows it is an offer. As a PRACK request should not be rejected, UA A 
       is recommended to wait for the answer1 until sending a PRACK response 
       with the answer to the offer2. Note that if UA A does not send a new 
       offer until the reliable provisional response with an answer to the 
       offer in the INVITE request is acknowledged with a PRACK request, 
       this case never happens. Therefore, to make implementations simple, a 
       UA acting as a UAS for INVITE transaction is recommended not to send 
       a UPDATE request with an offer until the reliable response with an 
       answer to the offer in the INVITE request is acknowledged with PRACK 
       request.  

       When offer2 is in a reliable provisional response or a successful 
       final response, UA A knows it is not the answer to the offer1. For a 
       reliable response to an initial INVITE request, this case never 
       happens. For a reliable response to a re-INVITE request, UA A can 
       detect the offer2 is not the answer1. In this case, UA A can not 
       reject offer2 in a reliable response, it is recommended to wait for 
       the answer1 until sending a PRACK request with the answer to the 
       offer2. Note that if UA A does not send an INVITE request without 
       session description if it has sent the offer which has not yet 
       received the answer to it, this case never happens.  

    3.2. Glare Case Handling 

       When both ends in a dialog send an offer at nearly the same time, UA 
       may receive a new offer before it receives the answer to the offer 
     
    Sawada & Kyzivat      Expires December 11, 2006              [Page 10] 
        
    Internet-Draft     SIP Usage of Offer/Answer Model           June 2006 
        

       itsends as described in Figure 4. This case is called 'glare' case in 
       general. 

        A                  B  
        |offer1      offer2|  
        |-------\  /-------|  
        |        \/        |  
        |        /\        |  
        |<------/  \------>|  
        
                                Figure 4 Glare Case 

       When offer2 is in an UPDATE request or (re-)INVITE request, it must 
       be rejected with a 491 response. 

       When offer2 is in a PRACK request, it may be accepted with 200 or may 
       be rejected with a 491 response. A 491 response may be adequate for 
       offer/answer model but it may delay the completion of the reliable 
       response transfer mechanism or, in worst case, may result in the 
       failure to complete SIP transaction because there is no clear retry 
       rule when a PRACK request is rejected with a 491 response. To avoid 
       this glare condition, UA is recommended not to send an offer, which 
       currently must be in an UPDATE request, if it has generated the 
       reliable provisional response with the answer to the offer in the 
       INVITE request which is not acknowledged with a PRACK request. 

       To avoid glare condition for offer2 in the response, UA A is 
       recommended not to send a new offer if it has generated (re)INVITE 
       request without session description which it has not received the 
       reliable response with the offer. 

    4. Add New Offer/Answer Usage in SIP 

       It is not recommended to add new SIP methods for the offer/answer 
       exchange beyond the ways described in this document. However, it may 
       be requested to have new offer/answer exchange methods as SIP 
       extensions evolve. In this clause, what should be taken into 
       considerations is noted in this section. 

    4.1. Explicit Usage 

       New method should define the usage explicitly without any ambiguity. 

    4.2. Rejection against an Offer 

       New method should define how to reject an offer where possible.

    4.3. Backward Compatibility 

       New method must keep backward compatibility. 

    4.4. Exceptional Case Handling 

       New method should take care of how to handle exceptional cases, 
       message crossing case and glare case. 

    5. Security Considerations 

       There are not any security issues beyond the referenced RFCs.
