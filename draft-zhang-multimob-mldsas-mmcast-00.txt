    Abstract 

       With the development of wireless and mobile technologies, mobile 
       multicast becomes a research hotspot. However, the current multicast 
       routing protocols can not provide the mobile multicast services. To 
       support the mobile multicast, the related multicast specifications 
       need to be extended. In this memo, we focus on the group membership 
       management protocol and define the new source address selection 
       policy for mobile multicast.

    1. Introduction 

       MLD is a subset of ICMPv6 and the message types in MLDv1 [3] and 
       MLDv2 [4] are 130, 131, 132 and 143. All the MLD messages use the 
       link-local address as the source address, and set the hop limit to be 
       1. Besides, to force the IPv6 routers on that link to check the MLD 
       messages, all the MLD messages are encapsulated in the hop-by-hop 
       option with router alert option [5].  

       MLD is an asymmetric protocol which consists of the router function 
       and the host function. The router function is used to set up the 
       multicast states for subscribers, while the host function is used by 
       subscribers to send the multicast join and leave messages, and to 
       respond to periodic query messages.  

       However, the current MLD specifications are designed to maintain the 
       dynamic group membership for the fixed nodes. If the MLD protocol is 
       directly used in mobile multicast services, it may cause a long 
       multicast service disruption. According to the MLD specifications, 
       this disruption may be 67 seconds even without the link layer 
       handover and IP layer handover delay [8]. To improve the performance 
       of mobile multicast, some mobile multicast management protocol 
       mechanism has been proposed to manage the mobile subscribers. H. Liu

       and H. Asaeda [9] discussed the requirements about the deployment of 
       IGMP/MLD protocols for mobile multicast services. Besides, H. Asaeda 
       and T. C. Schmidt [10] modified the IGMP/MLD and introduced an 
       optional Listener Hold function to support the mobile hosts. Recently, 
       Guan et al. [11] proposed the extended MLD protocol to provide the 
       mobile multicast management for mobile subscribers. However, using 
       the MLD protocols as the multicast membership management in mobile 
       environments conflicts with the source address selection policy in 
       MIPv6 [6]. The MLD specifications mandate the use of a link-local 
       IPv6 source address or the unspecified address (::) [7] for the MLD 
       message. However, the MIPv6 suggests that the mobile node should use 
       the HoA when mobile node transmits the multicast packets through the 
       bi-directional tunnel, and uses the CoA when transmit the multicast 
       packets through the current foreign networks.  

       This memo will extend the IPv6 source address selection rules for use 
       with MLD protocols in mobile multicast services.  

    2. Terminology 

       The terminology used in this memo is already defined in MLDv1 [3] and 
       MLDv2 [4].  

    3. Justification  

       The MLD specifications require that all MLD messages be sent with a 
       valid link-local IPv6 source address. This design principle can 
       restrict group management messages in local link to prevent the 
       diffusion of group membership, which is benefit to reduce the 
       redundant information in the networks. However, it is unable to 
       provide the multicast management for mobile subscribers.  

       To provide the mobile multicast services for mobile subscribers, the 
       MLD protocols need some extensions to manage the mobile multicast 
       states such as the multi-hop extensions in [11]. The foundational 
       problem is how to set up and maintain the multicast states for mobile 
       subscribers. As discussed above, using the traditional MLD 
       specifications will result in a long disruption time and conflict 
       with the mobility specifications.  

       This memo tries to solve these problems by extending a new policy 
       about the source address selection.  

    4. Source Address Selection for Mobile Multicast 

       To mark the multicast states for mobile subscribers, MLD Report and 
       Done message SHOULD be sent with a valid global unicast IPv6 address 
     
     
    Zhang et al.           Expires March 30, 2009                 [Page 3] 
        
    Internet-Draft      MLD Source Address Selection        September 2008 
        

       as the IPv6 source address. As for the MLD Report message, some 
       extensions SHOULD be added to carry the location information, 
       Identifier information and group information of mobile subscribers 
       according to [11].  

       Routers receiving an MLD Report or Done message with the global IPv6 
       address as the IPv6 source address MUST perform the extended MLD 
       function shown in [11].  

       The extension of MLD source address selection is used to distinguish 
       the fixed node and mobile node, and provides the necessary 
       information for mobile subscribers.  

    5. Security Considerations 

       The related security issues are discussed in MLDv1 [3] and MLDv2 [4].
