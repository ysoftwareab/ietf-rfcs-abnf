              Scope of Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses
                   draft-gont-6man-ipv6-ula-scope-00

Abstract

   Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULAs) are formally part of the
   IPv6 Global Unicast address space.  However, the semantics of ULAs
   clearly contradict the definition of "global scope".  This document
   discusses the why the terminology employed for the specification of
   ULAs is problematic, along with some practical consequences of the
   current specification of ULAs.  Finally, it formally updates RFC4291
   and RFC4193 such that the scope of ULAs is defined as "local".

1.  Introduction

   Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (commonly referred to as "ULAs")
   [RFC4193] are formally part of the IPv6 Global Unicast address space.
   However, the semantics of ULAs clearly contradict the definition of
   "global scope" [RFC4007].

   This document discussed the specification of ULAs and, in particular,
   of their associated scope.  Additionally, it discusses how the
   semantics of ULAs contradicts their formal address scope along with
   some and practical consequences of this problematic definition.
   Finally, this document formally updates RFC4193 and RFC4291, such
   that ULAs are defined to have "local scope" (larger than link-local,
   and smaller than "global").

      The problematic definition of ULAs was initially encountered when
      analyzing IPv6 address properties while working on
      [I-D.gont-v6ops-ipv6-addressing-considerations].  The issue became
      fully-evident from discussions with Brian Carpenter, both off-list
      and on-list [v6ops-thread].

2.  What Does 'Global Scope' mean?

   [RFC4007] defines the scope of an address as:

      "[the] topological span within which the address may be used as a
      unique identifier for an interface or set of interfaces"



Gont                      Expires July 9, 2021                  [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                  ULA Scope                   January 2021


   And defines the "global scope" to be used for:

      "uniquely identifying interfaces anywhere in the Internet"

3.  Scope of Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses

   [RFC4193] formally specifies Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses.
   [RFC4193] did not formally update [RFC3513], the current IPv6
   Addressing Architecture at the time [RFC4193] was published.
   Therefore, ULAs were specified as a different address type, but
   rather as part of the Global Unicast address space.

   [RFC3513] was eventually obsoleted by [RFC4291] (current revision of
   the IPv6 Addressing Architecture), but still did not formally
   accommodate ULAs into the IPv6 Addressing Architecture.  For
   instance, Section 2.4 of [RFC4291] notes that the type of an IPv6
   address is identified by the high-order bits of the address, as
   follows:

     Address type         Binary prefix        IPv6 notation   Section
     ------------         -------------        -------------   -------
     Unspecified          00...0  (128 bits)   ::/128          2.5.2
     Loopback             00...1  (128 bits)   ::1/128         2.5.3
     Multicast            11111111             FF00::/8        2.7
     Link-Local unicast   1111111010           FE80::/10       2.5.6
     Global Unicast       (everything else)

   and subsequently notes that:

      "Future specifications may redefine one or more sub-ranges of the
      Global Unicast space for other purposes, but unless and until that
      happens, implementations must treat all addresses that do not
      start with any of the above-listed prefixes as Global Unicast
      addresses."

   Therefore, ULAs still formally belong to the Global Unicast address
   space.

   Additionally, Section 3.3 of [RFC4193] (the specification of Unique
   Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses) defines the scope of ULAs as:

      "By default, the scope of these addresses is global.  That is,
      they are not limited by ambiguity like the site-local addresses
      defined in [ADDARCH].  Rather, these prefixes are globally unique,
      and as such, their applicability is greater than site-local
      addresses."

4.  Problems with the Definition of the ULA Scope

   Section 3.3 of [RFC4193] (the specification of Unique Local IPv6
   Unicast Addresses) defines the scope of ULAs as:

      "By default, the scope of these addresses is global.  That is,
      they are not limited by ambiguity like the site-local addresses
      defined in [ADDARCH].  Rather, these prefixes are globally unique,
      and as such, their applicability is greater than site-local
      addresses.  Their limitation is in the routability of the
      prefixes, which is limited to a site and any explicit routing
      agreements with other sites to propagate them (also see
      Section 4.1).  Also, unlike site-locals, a site may have more than
      one of these prefixes and use them at the same time."

   However, there is a problem in this analysis: ULA prefixes have a
   finite probability of being globally unique.  For instance,
   Section 3.2.3 of [RFC4193] computes the probability of collisions
   *when inter-connecting a limited number of networks employing ULAs*.
   As such, based on the definition of "scope" and "global scope" (see
   Section 2), ULAs cannot possibly have a "global scope" -- their scope
   is certainly smaller than "global".  And this non-global scope does
   limit the global routability of ULAs since, in principle, an address
   cannot be routed outside of its associated zone.

      The only ULAs that could possibly have "global scope" are the so-
      called ULA-C [I-D.ietf-ipv6-ula-central], that have so far *not*
      been formally specified.

   It should be noted that the non-global scope of ULAs does not
   preclude their usage for e.g. inter-site Virtual Private Networks
   (VPN), as discussed in Section 4.7 of [RFC4193].  For example, the
   private address space specified in [RFC1918] for IPv4 networks has
   non-global scope, but still is regularly used for inter-site VPNs.
   ULAs having a non-global scope simply means that while allocating
   "Global IDs" from a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) reduces the
   probability of collisions of Global IDs *when a limited number of
   networks employing ULAs are interconnected*, ULA prefixes cannot be
   expected to be globally unique.

      "Global scope" would imply that all ULA prefixes in use by any
      networks, whether interconnected or not, are unique.

5.  Practical Consequences

5.1.  Address Attributes in Programming Languages

   Python's ipaddress library [Python-ipaddr] defines 'IPv6Address'
   objects that have a number of attributes, including:

   o  'True' if the address is allocated for private networks.

   o  'True' if the address is allocated for public networks.

   For ULAs, the is_private attribute is 'True', while the is_global
   attribute is 'False'.  This contradicts the definition of ULAs as
   having "global scope" [RFC4291] [RFC4193], but is in line with the
   specification update performed by this document (see Section 6).

6.  Specification Updates

   The ultimate goal is to employ coherent terminology and definitions
   throughout the relevant protocol specifications.  Probably the only
   option to achieve this goal is update the definition of ULAs as
   having "local scope", with "local scope" defined as "larger than
   link-local, and smaller than global" (based on ULAs being defined as
   "local addresses").

   them, and normally limited by the Default-Free Zone (DFZ) (also see
   Section 4.1).

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is instructed to update the "IANA IPv6 Special-Purpose
   Address Registry" [IANA-ADDR-REG] by adding a "[RFCXXXX]" to the
   "RFC" column corresponding to the "fc00::/7" address block.

   Additionally, the following footnote:

      [4] See [RFC4193] for more details on the routability of Unique-
      Local addresses.  The Unique-Local prefix is drawn from the IPv6
      Global Unicast Address range, but is specified as not globally
      routed.

   must be replaced with:

      Local addresses, and [RFCXXXX] for details on the scope of Unique-
      Local addresses.

   upon publication of this document as an RFC.
