                       Embedding LOOPS in Geneve
                 draft-bormann-loops-geneve-binding-01

Abstract

   LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) aims to provide local
   in-network loss recovery.  It can be used with tunneling protocols to
   efficiently recover lost packets on a single segment of an end-to-end
   path instead of leaving recovery to the end-to-end protocol,
   traversing the entire path.

   [I-D.welzl-loops-gen-info] defines the information to be carried
   between LOOPS ingress and egress nodes in a generic way, giving a
   guideline on defining the common elements to embed LOOPS functions in
   various tunnel protocols.  The present document specifies how to
   embed LOOPS in the overlay tunnel protocol chosen for the initial
   LOOPS specification, Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].

1.  Introduction

   LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) aims to provide local
   in-network loss recovery.  The LOOPS problems and opportunities draft
   [I-D.li-tsvwg-loops-problem-opportunities] illustrates some typical
   scenarios where LOOPS are applicable.  One way to use LOOPS is to map
   it onto a tunnel protocol.  The path segment on which LOOPS is
   applied then is a tunnel, which can be an existing one or created on
   purpose.

   LOOPS allows the packet loss recovery to be performed over specific
   segments instead of end-to-end, enabling faster and more reliable
   data delivery.  [I-D.welzl-loops-gen-info] defines the information to
   be carried between LOOPS ingress and egress nodes in a generic way,
   giving a guideline on defining the common elements to embed LOOPS
   functions in various tunnel protocols.

Internet-Draft            Embed LOOPS in Geneve                June 2020


   Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve] is an encapsulation protocol that can
   be used to create overlay tunnels.  It defines an extensible TLV
   structure to carry so-called "tunnel options".  The present document
   employs this flexibility, specifying how to embed LOOPS in Geneve.
   This specification covers the format and Geneve-specific procedures
   only: the actual LOOPS function and procedures are defined in
   [I-D.welzl-loops-gen-info].

   LOOPS has two modes of loss recovery, retransmission and forward
   error correction (FEC).  The current version of the present document
   covers retransmission only.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terminology defined in
   [I-D.welzl-loops-gen-info].

3.  Geneve LOOPS Frame Format

   Figure 1 shows the format of the Geneve Header and a single Geneve
   Option, as defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].  Geneve LOOPS defines a
   new Option class called LOOPS to carry LOOPS forward and backward
   information.

                 Figure 1: Geneve Header and Option Format

   In the Geneve Option structure, a Geneve LOOPS option uses the
   following values:

   *  Option Class: TBD1 for LOOPS (see Section 5).

   *  Type: Based on the substructure already defined in Geneve, which
      uses bit 0 (the most significant bit) to indicate a critical
      option (see see Figure 2), LOOPS defines two type numbers: 0 for
      LOOPS retransmission mode, and 64 for FEC mode.  The present
      document only addresses messages with LType=0.

   TBD: Additional type numbers could be defined, possibly obviating the
   need for some of the flags in the current option structure.

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |C|    LType    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

             Figure 2: Type Field Format in Geneve LOOPS Option

   *  C: Critical bit as defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].

   *  LType: LOOPS Mode.

      -  0: Retransmission mode.  In this mode, the LOOPS option format
         and operations follow this document.

      -  64: FEC mode

      -  Further mode values can be assigned in an IANA registry (see
         Section 5.2).

   *  Length: Length of Variable Option Data field, expressed in four
      byte multiples excluding the option header, ranging from 0 to 31.
      As the option header is another four bytes, the total length of
      the option in bytes is therefore 4 * (1 + Length), yielding a
      maximum total length of 128 bytes.

   *  Variable option data: consists of two parts, Flags and Flag Based
      Data, as shown in Figure 3.

      -  Flags: 16 bits, as described in next subsection.  Some of the
         flags indicate the presence of additional data in the field of
         Flag Based Data.

      -  Flag Based Data: This field consists of one or multiple
         optional data blocks whose presence is indicated by the
         corresponding flag bits.  Any remaining bytes needed to reach a
         multiple of four bytes are filled with zeroes.

        Figure 3: Variable Option Data Format in Geneve LOOPS Option

3.1.  Flags and Flag Based Data

   Flags for LOOPS Tunnel Options are defined in Figure 4.  Some flags
   cause additional data blocks to occur in the Flags Based Data field.
   Those additional data blocks are placed in the order of the flags
   causing them.

       Figure 4: Flags in Variable Option Data in Geneve LOOPS Option

   A number of the flag bits are used on their own and do not cause
   carrying additional data:

   *  I: Initial Packet Sequence Number (PSN) flag; may be set by the
      LOOPS ingress to notify the egress about using a new initial PSN.

   *  R: Initial PSN Received flag; echo of I flag provided by the LOOPS
      egress.

   *  D: ACK Desired flag; set by the LOOPS ingress if it wants the
      egress to generate an acknowledgement immediately upon receiving a
      particular packet.

   These flag bits cause the addition of a single 32-bit number each:

Internet-Draft            Embed LOOPS in Geneve                June 2020


   *  S: PSN flag; indicates a PSN data block is carried in the Flag
      Based Data field.  It must be set when a packet payload is
      present.  It must not be set if the packet is a pure LOOPS ACK
      packet, i.e. when no payload is included in the packet.

   *  T: Timestamp flag.  When set, it indicates a Timestamp data block
      is carried in the Flag Based Data field.
      // TBD: Might want to have "timestamp" and "echo" fields of less
      or
      // more than 4 bytes.

   *  E: Echoed Timestamp flag.  When set, it indicates an Echoed
      Timestamp data block is carried in the Flag Based Data field.

   *  A: ACK number flag.  When set, it indicates the presence of a
      Block 1 ACK information block.

   *  R: Reception time flag: May only be set if A is set.  Indicates
      that an absolute reception time is given (Format TBD).

   Finally, a single flag bit is defined that causes the addition of a
   variable-length block (therefore this flag is put as the least
   significant bit of Flags):

   *  B: Block 2 flag.  When set, it indicates the presence a Block 2
      ACK information block, with the following format: TBD
      // copy over the structure we have in gen-info.

   Acknowledgement information can be sent as a pure ACK packet without
   payload or piggybacked in a data packet.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [I-D.welzl-loops-gen-info] and
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve] apply.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Geneve Option Class

   IANA is requested to assign a new option class for LOOPS from the
   "Geneve Option Class" registry.

5.2.  LOOPS Geneve Type Numbers

   IANA is requested to create a registry for type numbers ("LType") as
   used in the TBD1 option class for LOOPS from the "Geneve Option
   Class" registry, with the following three columns:

   Type Number:  Integer between 0 and 127

   Description:  Short Description

   The initial contents of the registry is:
