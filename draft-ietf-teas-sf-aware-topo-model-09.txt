1.  Introduction

   RFC Ed.: In this document, please replace all occurrences of 'XXXX'
   with the actual RFC number (and remove this note).

   Normally network connectivity services are discussed as a means to
   inter-connect various abstract or physical network topological
   elements, such as ports, link termination points and nodes [RFC8795]
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].  However, the connectivity services,
   strictly speaking, interconnect not the network topology elements
   per-se, rather, located on/associated with the various network and
   service functions [RFC7498] [RFC7665].  In many scenarios it is
   beneficial to decouple the service/network functions from the network
   topology elements hosting them, describe them in some unambiguous and
   identifiable way (so that it would be possible, for example, to auto-
   discover on the network topology service/network functions with
   identical or similar functionality and characteristics) and engineer
   the connectivity between the service/network functions, rather than
   between their current topological locations.

   Today a network offers to its clients far more services than just
   connectivity across the network.  Large variety of physical, logical
   and/or virtual service functions, network functions and transport
   functions (collectively named in this document as SFs) could be
   allocated for and assigned to a client.  As described in the appendix
   of this document, there are some important use cases, in which the
   network needs to represent to the client SFs at the client's disposal
   as topological elements in relation to other elements of a topology
   (i.e. nodes, links, link and tunnel termination points) used by the
   network to describe itself to the client.  Not only would such
   information allow for the client to auto-discover the network's SFs
   available for the services provisioned for the client, it would also
   allow for the client selecting the SFs, duel-optimizing the selection
   on the SF location on the network and connectivity means (e.g.  TE
   tunnels) to inter-connect the SFs.  Consequently thus would give to
   both the network and the client powerful means for the service
   function chain (SFC [RFC7498] [RFC7665]) negotiation to achieve most
   efficient and cost effective (from the network point of view) and
   most optimal yet satisfying all necessary constraints of SFCs (from
   the client's point of view).

   This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] data model that allows service
   functions to be represented along with TE topology elements.

Internet-Draft          SF Aware Topo YANG Model           February 2022


   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   o  Network Function (NF): A functional block within a network
      infrastructure that has well-defined external interfaces and well-
      defined functional behaviour [ETSI-NFV-TERM].  Such functions
      include message router, CDN, session border controller, WAN
      cceleration, DPI, firewall, NAT, QoE monitor, PE router, BRAS, and
      radio/fixed access network nodes.

   o  Network Service: Composition of Network Function(s) and/or Network
      Service(s), defined by its functional and behavioural
      specification.  The Network Service contributes to the behaviour
      of the higher layer service, which is characterized by at least
      performance, dependability, and security specifications.  The end-
      to-end network service behaviour is the result of the combination
      of the individual network function behaviours as well as the
      behaviours of the network infrastructure composition mechanism
      [ETSI-NFV-TERM].

   o  Service Function (SF): A function that is responsible for specific
      treatment of received packets.  A service function can act at
      various layers of a protocol stack (e.g., at the network layer or
      other OSI layers).  As a logical component, a service function can
      be realized as a virtual element or be embedded in a physical
      network element.  One or more service functions can be embedded in
      the same network element.  Multiple occurrences of the service
      function can exist in the same administrative domain.  A non-
      exhaustive list of service functions includes: firewalls, WAN and
      application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), server
      load balancers, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], HTTP header
      enrichment functions, and TCP optimizers.  The generic term "L4-L7
      services" is often used to describe many service functions
      [RFC7498].

   o  Service Function Chain (SFC): A service function chain defines an
      ordered or partially ordered set of abstract service functions and
      ordering constraints that must be applied to packets, frames, and/
      or flows selected as a result of classification.  An example of an
      abstract service function is a firewall.  The implied order may



Bryskin, et al.          Expires August 31, 2022                [Page 4]

      not be a linear progression as the architecture allows for SFCs
      that copy to more than one branch, and also allows for cases where
      there is flexibility in the order in which service functions need
      to be applied.  The term "service chain" is often used as
      shorthand for "service function chain" [RFC7498].

   o  Connectivity Service: Any service between layer 0 and layer 3
      aiming at delivering traffic among two or more end customer edge
      nodes connected to provider edge nodes.  Examples include L3VPN,
      L2VPN etc.

   o  Link Termination Point (LTP): A conceptual point of connection of
      a TE node to one of the TE links, terminated by the TE node.
      Cardinality between an LTP and the associated TE link is 1:0..1
      [RFC8795].

   o  Tunnel Termination Point (TTP): An element of TE topology
      representing one or several of potential transport service
      termination points (i.e. service client adaptation points such as
      WDM/OCh transponder).  TTP is associated with (hosted by) exactly
      one TE node.  TTP is assigned with the TE node scope unique ID.
      Depending on the TE node's internal constraints, a given TTP
      hosted by the TE node could be accessed via one, several or all TE
      links terminated by the TE node [RFC8795].

   o  Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications
      (TOSCA): A language standard specified by OASIS, to describe
      service components and their relationships using a service
      topology, and management procedures using orchestration processes.
      OASIS is a nonprofit consortium that drives the development,
      convergence and adoption of open standards for the global
      information society.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is presented
   in this document, by using the tree format defined in [RFC8340].

1.3.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes, actions, and other data model
   objects are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from
   the context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise,
   names are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

2.  Modeling Considerations

   The model introduced in this document is an augmentation of the TE
   Topology model defined in [RFC8795].  SFs are modeled as child
   elements of a TE node similarly to how Link Termination Points (LTPs)
   and Tunnel Termination Points (TTPs) are modeled in the TE Topology
   model.  The SFs are defined as opaque objects identified via topology
   unique service-function-id's.  Each SF has one or more Connection
   Points (CPs) identified via SF-unique sf-connection-point-id's, over
   which the SF could be connected to other SFs resided on the same TE
   node, as well as to other elements of the TE node, in particular, to
   the node's LTPs and/or TTPs.  An interested client may use service-
   function-id's to look up the SFs in TOSCA or YANG data store(s)
   defined by [ETSI-NFV-YANG] to retrieve the details of the SFs, for
   example, to understand the SF's mutual substitutability.

   The TE Topology model introduces a concept of Connectivity Matrix
   (CM), and uses the CM to describe which and at what costs a TE node's
   LTPs could be inter-connected internally across the TE node.  The
   model defined in this document heavily uses the same concept to
   describe the SF connectivity via introducing 3 additional CMs:

   1.  SF2SF CM (SF to SF Connectivity Matrix).  This CM describes which
       pairs of SFs could be locally inter-connected, and, if yes, in
       which direction, via which CPs and at what costs.  In other
       words, the SF2SF CM describes how SFs residing on the same TE



Bryskin, et al.          Expires August 31, 2022                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          SF Aware Topo YANG Model           February 2022


       node could be inter-connected into local from the TE node's
       perspective SFCs;

   2.  SF2LTP CM (SF to LTP Connectivity Matrix).  This CM describes
       how, in which direction and at what costs the TE node's SFs could
       be connected to the TE node's LTPs and hence to SFs residing on
       neighboring TE nodes that are connected to LTPs at the remote
       ends of corresponding TE links;

   3.  SF2TTP CM (SF to TTP Connectivity Matrix).  This CM describes
       how, in which direction and at what costs the TE node's SFs could
       be connected to the TE node's TTPs and hence to SFs residing on
       other TE nodes on the topology that could be inter-connected with
       the TE node in question via TE tunnels terminated by the
       corresponding TTPs.

   In addition to SF2SF CM, the local SF chaining could be described
   with the help of ETSI models Virtual Links (VLs) [ETSI-NFV-YANG].
   This option is especially useful when the costs of the local chaining
   are negligible as compared to ones of the end-to-end SFCs said local
   SFCs are part of.

   Section 3 and 4 provide the YANG model structure and the YANG module
   for SF-aware Topology.  Section 5 and 6 provide the YANG model
   structure and the YANG module for Data Center Compute Node resource
   abstraction.  This provides an example of SF2LTP CM where DC compute
   nodes are connected to LTPs at the remote ends of the corresponding
   TE links.  This use-case is described in Section 10 of Appendix C.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types/tet:te-topology/sf
      This subtree specifies the topology type.  Modifying the
      configurations can make topology type invalid and cause
      interruption to the specified SF Aware TE topology and the related
      SF Aware TE topologies.

   /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/tet:te/tet:te-node-attributes/
   service-function
      This subtree specifies the configurations of service functions in
      SF Aware TE nodes.  Modifying the configurations in this subtree
      can change the configurations of service functions in the

      specified node, causing these service functions disabled or
      misbehaving in the specified node.

   /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/tet:te/tet:tunnel-termination-point/
   service-function
      This subtree specifies the configurations of service functions on
      a tunnel-termination-point in SF Aware TE nodes.  Modifying the
      configurations in this subtree can change the configurations of
      service functions on the spcified tunnel-termination-point in the
      specified node, causing these service functions disabled or
      misbehaving.

   /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/service-functions
      This subtree specifies the available service functions in SF Aware
      TE nodes.  Modifying the configurations in this subtree can change
      the configurations of the available service functions in the
      specified node, causing these service functions disabled or
      misbehaving in the specified node.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types/tet:te-topology/sf
      Unauthorized access to this subtree can disclose the SF Aware TE
      topology type.

   /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/tet:te/tet:te-node-attributes/
   service-function
      Unauthorized access to this subtree can disclose the operational
      state information of the service functions in the specified SF
      Aware TE node.

   /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/tet:te/tet:information-source-entry/
   service-function
      Unauthorized access to this subtree can disclose the operational
      state information of the service functions in the specified SF
      Aware TE node.

   /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/tet:te/tet:tunnel-termination-point/
   service-function
      Unauthorized access to this subtree can disclose the operational
      state information of the service functions on the specified
      tunnel-termination-point in the specified SF Aware TE node.

   /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/service-functions

Appendix A.  Companion YANG Model for Non-NMDA Compliant Implementations

   The YANG module ietf-te-topology-sf defined in this document is
   designed to be used in conjunction with implementations that support
   the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in
   [RFC8342].  In order to allow implementations to use the model even
   in cases when NMDA is not supported, the following companion module,
   ietf-te-topology-sf-state, is defined as state model, which mirrors
   the module ietf-te-topology-sf defined earlier in this document.
   However, all data nodes in the companion module are non-configurable,
   to represent the applied configuration or the derived operational
   states.

   The companion module, ietf-te-topology-sf-state, is redundant and
   SHOULD NOT be supported by implementations that support NMDA.

   As the structure of the companion module mirrors that of the
   coorespinding NMDA model, the YANG tree of the companion module is
   not depicted separately.

B.2.  A Topology with an Encapsulated Network Service

   In this example, a network service consists of several inter-
   connected network functions (NFs), and is represented by this model
   as an encapsulated opaque object without the details between its
   internals.

Appendix C.  Use Cases for SF Aware Topology Models

C.1.  Exporting SF/NF Information to Network Clients and Other Network
      SDN Controllers

   In the context of Service Function Chain (SFC) orchestration one
   existing problem is that there is no way to formally describe a
   Service or Network Function in a standard way (recognizable/
   understood by a third party) as a resource of a network topology
   node.

   One implication of this is that there is no way for the orchestrator
   to give a network client even a ball-park idea as to which network's
   SFs/NFs are available for the client's use/control and where they are
   located in the network even in terms of abstract topologies/virtual
   networks configured and managed specifically for the client.
   Consequently, the client has no say on how the SFCs provided for the
   client by the network should be set up and managed (which SFs are to
   be used and how they should be chained together, optimized,
   manipulated, protected, etc.).

   Likewise, there is no way for the orchestrator to export SF/NF
   information to other network controllers.  The SFC orchestrator may
   serve, for example, a higher level controller (such as Network
   Slicing Orchestrator), with the latter wanting at least some level of
   control as to which SFs/NFs it wants on its SFCs and how the Service
   Function Paths (SFPs) are to be routed and provisioned, especially,
   if it uses services of more than one SFC orchestrator.

   The issue of exporting of SF/NF information could be addressed by
   defining a model, in which formally described/recognizable SF/NF
   instances are presented as topological elements, for example, hosted
   by TE, L3 or L2 topology nodes (see Figure 1).  The model could
   describe whether, how and at what costs the SFs/NFs hosted by a given
   node could be chained together, how these intra-node SFCs could be
   connected to the node's Service Function Forwarders (SFFs, entities
   dealing with SFC NSHs and metadata), and how the SFFs could be
   connected to the node's Tunnel and Link Termination Points (TTPs and
   LTPs) to chain the intra-node SFCs across the network topology.

C.2.  Flat End-to-end SFCs Managed on Multi-domain Networks

   SFCs may span multiple administrative domains, each of which
   controlled by a separate SFC controller.  The usual solution for such
   a scenario is the Hierarchical SFCs (H-SFCs) [RFC8459], in which the
   higher level orchestrator controls only SFs located on domain border
   nodes.  Said higher level SFs are chained together into higher level
   SFCs via lower level (intra-domain) SFCs provisioned and controlled
   independently by respective domain controllers.  The decision as to
   which higher level SFCs are connected to which lower level SFCs is
   driven by packet re-classification every time the packet enters a
   given domain.  Said packet re-classification is a very time-consuming
   operation.  Furthermore, the independent nature of higher and lower
   level SFC control is prone to configuration errors, which may lead to
   long lasting loops and congestions.  It is highly desirable to be
   able to set up and manage SFCs spanning multiple domains in a flat
   way as far as the data plane is concerned (i.e. with a single packet
   classification at the ingress into the multi-domain network but
   without re-classifications on domain ingress nodes).

   One way to achieve this is to have the domain controllers expose SF/
   NF- aware topologies, and have the higher level orchestrator operate
   on the network-wide topology, the product of merging of the
   topologies catered by the domain controllers.  This is similar in
   spirit to setting up, coordinating and managing the transport

   connectivity (TE tunnels) on a multi-domain multi-vendor transport
   network.

C.3.  Managing SFCs with TE Constraints

   Some SFCs require per SFC link/element and end-to-end TE constrains
   (bandwidth, delay/jitter, fate sharing/diversity. etc.).  Said
   constraints could be ensured via carrying SFPs inside overlays that
   are traffic engineered with the constrains in mind.  A good analogy
   would be orchestrating delay constrained L3 VPNs.  One way to support
   such L3 VPNs is to carry MPLS LSPs interconnecting per-VPN VRFs
   inside delay constrained TE tunnels interconnecting the PEs hosting
   the VRFs.

   arbitrary SFCs, especially those that span multiple administrative
   domains with each domain controlled by a separate controller, is a
   very difficult challenge.  Currently it is addressed by pre-
   provisioning on the network of multiple TE tunnels with various TE
   characteristics, and "nailing down" SFs/NFs to "strategic" locations
   (e.g. nodes terminating many of such tunnels) in a hope that an
   adequate set of tunnels could be found to carry the SFP of a given
   TE-constrained SFC.  Such an approach is especially awkward in the
   case when some or all of the SFs/NFs are VNFs (i.e. could be
   instantiated at multiple network locations).

   SF/NF-aware TE topology model in combination with TE tunnel model
   will allow for the network orchestrator (or a client controller) to
   compute, set up and manipulate the TE overlays in the form of TE
   tunnel chains (see Figure 3).

   Said chains could be duel-optimized compromising on optimal SF/NF
   locations with optimal TE tunnels interconnecting them.  The TE
   tunnel chains (carrying multiple similarly constrained SFPs) could be
   adequately constrained both at individual TE tunnel level and at the
   chain end-to-end level.

C.4.  SFC Protection and Load Balancing

   Currently the combination of TE topology & tunnel models offers to a
   network controller various capabilities to recover an individual TE
   tunnel from network failures occurred on one or more network links or
   transit nodes on the TE paths taken by the TE tunnel's connection(s).
   However, there is no simple way to recover a TE tunnel from a failure
   affecting its source or destination node.  SF/NF-aware TE topology
   model can decouple the association of a given SF/NF with its location
   on the network topology by presenting multiple, identifiable as
   mutually substitutable SFs/NFs hosted by different TE topology nodes.
   So, for example, if it is detected that a given TE tunnel destination
   node is malfunctioning or has gone out of service, the TE tunnel
   could be re-routed to terminate on a different node hosting
   functionally the same SFs/NFs as ones hosted by the failed node (see
   Figures 6).

   This is in line with the ACTN edge migration and function mobility
   concepts [RFC8453].  It is important to note that the described
   strategy works much better for the stateless SFs/NFs.  This is
   because getting the alternative stateful SFs/NFs into the same
   respective states as the current (i.e. active, affected by failure)
   are is a very difficult challenge.

               Figure 4: SFC recovery: SF2 on node NE1 fails

   At the SFC level the SF/NF-aware TE topology model can offer SFC
   dynamic restoration capabilities against failed/malfunctioning SFs/
   NFs by identifying and provisioning detours to a TE tunnel chain, so
   that it starts carrying the SFC's SFPs towards healthy SFs/NFs that
   are functionally the same as the failed ones.  Furthermore, multiple
   parallel TE tunnel chains could be pre-provisioned for the purpose of
   SFC load balancing and end-to-end protection.  In the latter case
   said parallel TE tunnel chains could be placed to be sufficiently
   disjoint from each other.

C.5.  Network Clock Synchronization

   Many current and future network applications (including 5g and IoT
   applications) require very accurate time services (PTP level, ns
   resolution).  One way to implement the adequate network clock
   synchronization for such services is via describing network clocks as
   NFs on an NF-aware TE topology optimized to have best possible delay
   variation characteristics.  Because such a topology will contain
   delay/delay variation metrics of topology links and node cross-
   connects, as well as costs in terms of delay/delay variation of
   connecting clocks to hosting them node link and tunnel termination
   points, it will be possible to dynamically select and provision bi-
   directional time-constrained deterministic paths or trees connecting
   clocks (e.g. grand master and boundary clocks) for the purpose of
   exchange of clock synchronization information.  Note that network
   clock aware TE topologies separately provided by domain controllers
   will enable multi-domain network orchestrator to set up and
   manipulate the clock synchronization paths/trees spanning multiple
   network domains.

C.6.  Client - Provider Network Slicing Interface

   3GPP defines network slice as "a set of network functions and the
   resources for these network functions which are arranged and
   configured, forming a complete logical network to meet certain
   network characteristics" [I-D.defoy-netslices-3gpp-network-slicing]
   [_3GPP.28.801].  Network slice could be also defined as a logical
   partition of a provider's network that is owned and managed by a
   tenant.  SF/NF-aware TE topology model has a potential to support a
   very important interface between network slicing clients and
   providers because, on the one hand, the model can describe
   holistically and hierarchically the client's requirements and
   preferences with respect to a network slice functional, topological
   and traffic engineering aspects, as well as of the degree of resource
   separation/ sharing between the slices, thus allowing for the client
   (up to agreed upon extent) to dynamically (re-)configure the slice or
   (re-)schedule said (re-)configurations in time, while, on the other
   hand, allowing for the provider to convey to the client the slice's
   operational state information and telemetry the client has expressed
   interest in.

C.7.  Dynamic Assignment of Regenerators for L0 Services

   On large optical networks, some of provided to their clients L0
   services could not be provisioned as single OCh trails, rather, as
   chains of such trails interconnected via regenerators, such as 3R
   regenerators.  Current practice of the provisioning of such services
   requires configuration of explicit paths (EROs) describing identity



Bryskin, et al.          Expires August 31, 2022               [Page 44]

Internet-Draft          SF Aware Topo YANG Model           February 2022


   and location of regenerators to be used.  A solution is highly
   desirable that could:

   o  Identify such services based, for example, on optical impairment
      computations;

   o  Assign adequate for the services regenerators dynamically out of
      the regenerators that are grouped together in pools and
      strategically scattered over the network topology nodes;

   o  Compute and provision supporting the services chains of optical
      trails interconnected via so selected regenerators, optimizing the
      chains to use minimal number of regenerators, their optimal
      locations, as well as optimality of optical paths interconnecting
      them;

   o  Ensure recovery of such chains from any failures that could happen
      on links, nodes or regenerators along the chain path.

   NF-aware TE topology model (in this case L1 NF-aware L0 topology
   model) is just the model that could provide a network controller (or
   even a client controller operating on abstract NF-aware topologies
   provided by the network) to realize described above computations and
   orchestrate the service provisioning and network failure recovery
   operations (see Figure 7).

C.8.  Dynamic Assignment of OAM Functions for L1 Services

   OAM functionality is normally managed by configuring and manipulating
   TCM/MEP functions on network ports terminating connections or their
   segments over which OAM operations, such as performance monitoring,
   are required to be performed.  In some layer networks (e.g.
   Ethernet) said TCMs/MEPs could be configured on any network ports.
   In others (e.g.  OTN/ODUk) the TCMs/MEPs could be configured on some
   (but not all network ports) due to the fact that the OAM
   functionality (i.e. recognizing and processing of OAM messages,
   supporting OAM protocols and FSMs) requires in these layer networks
   certain support in the data plane, which is not available on all
   network nodes.  This makes TCMs/MEPs good candidates to be modeled as
   NFs.  This also makes TCM/MEP aware topology model a good basis for
   placing dynamically an ODUk connection to pass through optimal OAM
   locations without mandating the client to specify said locations
   explicitly.

C.9.  SFC Abstraction and Scaling

   SF/NF-aware topology may contain information on native SFs/NFs (i.e.
   SFs/NFs as known to the provider itself) and/or abstract SFs/NFs
   (i.e.  logical/macro SFs/NFs representing one or more SFCs each made
   of native and/or lower level abstract SFs/NFs).  As in the case of
   abstracting topology nodes, abstracting SFs/NFs is hierarchical in
   nature - the higher level of SF/NF-aware topology, the "larger"
   abstract SFs/NFs are, i.e. the larger data plane SFCs they represent.
   This allows for managing large scale networks with great number of
   SFs/NFs (such as Data Center interconnects) in a hierarchical, highly
   scalable manner resulting in control of very large number of flat in
   the data plane SFCs that span multiple domains.

C.10.  Dynamic Compute/VM/Storage Resource Assignment

   In a distributed data center network, virtual machines for compute
   resources may need to be dynamically re-allocated due to various
   reasons such as DCI network failure, compute resource load balancing,
   etc.  In many cases, the DCI connectivity for the source and the
   destination is not predetermined.  There may be a pool of sources and
   a pool of destination data centers associated with re-allocation of
   compute/VM/storage resources.  There is no good mechanism to date to
   capture this dynamicity nature of compute/VM/storage resource
   reallocation.  Generic Compute/VM/Storage resources can be described
   and announced as a SF, where a DC hosting these resources can be
   modeled as an abstract node.  Topology interconnecting these abstract
   nodes (DCs) in general is of multi-domain nature.  Thus, SF-aware
   topology model can facilitate a joint optimization of TE network
   resources and Compute/VM/Storage resources and solve Compute/VM/
   Storage mobility problem within and between DCs (see Figure 8).

C.11.  Application-aware Resource Operations and Management

   Application stratum is the functional grouping which encompasses
   application resources and the control and management of these
   resources.  These application resources are used along with network
   services to provide an application service to clients/end-users.
   Application resources are non-network resources critical to achieving
   the application service functionality.  Examples of application
   resources include: caches, mirrors, application specific servers,
   content, large data sets, and computing power.  Application service
   is a networked application offered to a variety of clients (e.g.,
   server backup, VM migration, video cache, virtual network on-demand,
   5G network slicing, etc.).  The application servers that host these
   application resources can be modeled as an abstract node.  There may
   be a variety of server types depending on the resources they host.
   Figure 9 shows one example application aware topology for video cache
   server distribution.

C.12.  Interconnection between Service Functions/Termination Points in
       uCPE

   Universal Customer Premises Equipment (uCPE) enables Virtual Network
   Functions (VNFs) at the client site. uCPE is based on the Network
   Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) - generally Linux
   distribution with integrated software that offers:

   o  Virtual Switch functionality

   o  Full virtualization/containerization solution

   o  Data path acceleration tool-kits

   o  Management layer

   The sf-aware-topo-model placed in the controller controls via the
   management layer of uCPE the interconnection between:

   o  virtual ports of VNFs

   o  virtual ports of Virtual Switch abstraction elements

   o  physical ports of uCPE

   Figure 10 shows an example application aware topology for
   interconnection between Logical Network Elements [RFC8530], Network
   Instances [RFC8529], uCPE node Termination Points [RFC8345].  In
   Figure 10 the following elements are presented:

   o  3 Logical Network Elements (vCPEL3_WAN1,vCPEL3_WAN2,vSD-WAN)

   o  4 Network Instances (vCPEL2)

   o  4 Termination Points (Physical Ports)

   There are two types of access provided to the client.

   The 1st access "Internet" topology part: 1st uCPE Termination Point
   "WAN1_port_internet" -- NI (vCPEL2) -- LNE (vCPEL3_telco_internet) --
   NI (vCPEL2) -- vSD-WAN_port_internet.

   The 2nd access "MPLS" topology part: 2nd Termination Point
   "WAN2_port_mpls" -- NI (vCPEL2) -- LNE (vCPEL3_telco_mpls) -- NI
   (vCPEL2) -- vSD-WAN_port_mpls.

   Finally SD-WAN balances the traffic via two WAN ports (Termination

   Points).

   An example of an instance data tree in the XML format is presented in

   router -- uCPE ( Termination Point WAN -- NI (vCPEL2) -- LNE (vCPEL3)
   )

   In uCPE, Termination Point (WAN) has id 1.  On the NNI
   (connectionpoint_id == 10) port of NI the trunk mode is configured.
   On UNI ports of NI (cp_id == 13) access mode is configured.  Port
   with cp_id == 13 is connected to LNE cp_id = 1.
