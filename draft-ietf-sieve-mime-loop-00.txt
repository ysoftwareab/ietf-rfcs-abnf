Abstract

   The current Sieve language has no way to look at individual MIME
   parts, looping mechanism, or any way to manipulate those individual
   parts.  This document defines extensions for each of these needs.

Internet-Draft        Sieve Mime Test/Iterator/Etc.        February 2006


   This document is being discussed in the MTA-FILTERS mailing lists,
   ietf-mta-filters@imc.org.


1.  Introduction

   Sieve scripts are used to make decisions about the disposition of a
   mail message.  The original Sieve spec, [5], defined operators for
   looking at the message headers, such as addresses and the subject.
   Other extensions provide access to the body of the message, or allow
   you to manipulate the header of the message.  But none of these
   extensions take into account that MIME messages ([1]) are often
   complex objects, consisting of many parts and sub-parts.  This
   extension defines mechanisms for performing tests on MIME body parts,
   looping through the MIME body parts, changing the contents of a MIME
   body part, and enclosing the message with a wrapper.


2.  Sieve Loops

   The current Sieve language has no looping mechanism.  Given that
   messages may contain multiple attachments, in order to support
   filters that apply to any and all attachments, we introduce a new
   control command: "for_every_part", which is an iterator that walks
   though every MIME part of a message, including nested parts, and
   applies the specified block to each of them.  The iterator will start
   with the first MIME part (as its current context) and will execute a
   command block (Sieve commands enclosed by { ...}).  Upon completion
   of this command block, the iterator advances to the next MIME part
   (as its current context) and executes the same command block again.

   NOTE: Need to deal with this comment
   (http://www.imc.org/ietf-mta-filters/mail-archive/msg02707.html):
   What will this do: for.every.part { if (some test here) {
   for.every.part { ... } } } i.e. will the internal "for" be anchored
   at the focus established by the enclosing "for" ?  I'd hope so, but
   this should be stated.

   NOTE: Need to deal with this comment
   (http://www.imc.org/ietf-mta-filters/mail-archive/msg02707.html):
   BTW, shouldn't there be a "mime" shorthand for testing the type/
   subtype, without requiring if allof (mime :type "multipart", mime
   :subtype "alternative") ?  Especially for any recursive version of
   "mime" (since the elements inside of "allof" can be matching
   different mime parts).

   The iterator can be terminated prematurely by a new sieve command,
   "break".

   Usage: for_every_part block

   Usage: break;


3.  Test "mime"

   Usage: mime [:anychild] [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE] <header-names:
      string-list> [<parameter-names: string-list>] <key-list: string-
      list>

   Usage: mime [:filename] ...

   Usage: mime [:type] ...

   Usage: mime [:subtype] ...

   For Sieve tests on MIME parts, a new Sieve test ("mime") is defined.
   Similar in concept to the Sieve "header" test, it will parse the MIME
   header lines so that tests can be performed on specific elements.

   If :anychild is NOT specified:

      If used within the context of a "for_every_part" iterator, the
      "mime" test will examine the headers associated with the current
      MIME part context.

      If used outside the context of a "for_every_part" iterator, the
      "mime" test will examine only the outer headers of the message.

   If :anychild IS specified, the "mime" test will examine all MIME body
   parts and return true if any of them satisfies the test.

   The "mime" test has all of the options available from the header
   test, [5] section 5.7.  In addition, these options are available:

   :filename examines the "Content-Disposition:" header field for its
      "filename" parameter.  If there is no "Content-Disposition:"
      header field, then it will look at the "Content-Type:" header
      field for the "name" parameter.

   :type examines the "Content-Type:" header field type parameter.

   :subtype examines the "Content-Type:" header field subtype parameter.

   NOTE: We need to add some way to look at parameter lists, ala
   http://www.imc.org/ietf-mta-filters/mail-archive/msg01655.html and
   related messages: Content-Type: text/plain; charset="foo"

4.  Action Replace

   Usage: replace ["mime"] [":subject" string] [":from" string]
      <replacement: string>

   A new sieve action command is defined to allow the MIME part to be
   replaced by a text message.  The "replace" command causes a MIME part
   to be removed and replaced with the text supplied by the command.

   When used in the context of a "for_every_part" loop, the MIME part to
   be replaced is the "current" MIME part.  If the current MIME context
   is a multipart MIME part, the entire multipart MIME part is replaced,
   which would alter the MIME structure of the message by eliminating
   all of the children of the multipart part.  (Replacing a non-
   multipart MIME part within a "for_every_part" loop context does not
   alter the overall message structure.)

   When used outside the context of a "for_every_part" loop, the MIME
   part to be replaced is the entire message.

   If the :mime parameter is not specified, the replacement string is a
   text/plain part.

   If the :mime parameter is specified, then the replacement string is,
   in fact, a MIME entity as defined in [1] section 2.4, including both
   MIME headers and content.  If the optional :mime parameter is not
   supplied, the reason string is considered to be a UTF-8 string.

   If the entire message is being replaced, a ":subject" parameter
   specifies a subject line to attach to the message that is generated.
   UTF-8 characters can be used in the string argument; implementations
   MUST convert the string to [2] encoded words if and only if non-ASCII
   characters are present.  Implementations MUST preserve the previous
   Subject header as an Original-Subject header.

   If the entire message is being replaced, a ":from" parameter may be
   used to specify an alternate address to use in the From field of the
   message that is generated.  The string must specify a valid [4]
   mailbox-list.  Implementations SHOULD check the syntax and generate
   an error when a syntactically invalid ":from" parameter is specified.
   Implementations MAY also impose restrictions on what addresses can
   specified in a ":from" parameter; it is suggested that values which
   fail such a validity check simply be ignored rather than causing the
   vacation action to fail.  Implementations MUST preserve the previous
   From header as an Original-From header.

5.  Action Enclose

   Usage: enclose <:subject string> <:headers string-list> string

   A new sieve action command is defined to allow an entire message to
   be enclosed as an attachment to a new message.  This enclose action
   takes precedance over all other message modifications, such as
   "replace".  If multiple "enclose" actions are executed by a script,
   only the text specified on the last one is used when creating the
   enclosed message.  This action does not affect messages that are
   forwarded via a "redirect" action.

   Specifically, the original message becomes a multipart/mixed message
   with two parts: a text/plain portion with the string argument as its
   body, and a message/rfc822 portion with the original message
   enclosed.  The Content-Type: header field becomes multipart/mixed.
   The Subject: header is specified by the :subject argument.  Any
   headers specified by :headers are copied from the old message into
   the new message.


6.  Sieve Capability Strings

   A Sieve implementation that defines the "for_every_part" and "break"
   actions will advertise the capability string "for_every_part".

   A Sieve implementation that defines the "mime" test will advertise
   the capability string "mime".

   A Sieve implementation that defines the "replace" action will
   advertise the capability string "replace".

   A Sieve implementation that defines the "enclose" action will
   advertise the capability string "enclose".


7.  Examples

7.1.  Example 1

   A Sieve script to replace all the Windows executable attachments in a
   message would be:

   require [ "for_every_part", "mime", "replace" ];
   for_every_part {
       if ( anyof ( mime :subtype :is "exe", mime :filename :matches "*.com" ) {
           replace "Executable attachment removed by user filter";
       }

   }

7.2.  Example 2

   A Sieve script to warn the user about executable attachment types
   would be:

   require [ "for_every_part", "mime", "enclose" ];

   for_every_part {
       if mime :filename :matches ["*.com", "*.exe", "*.vbs", "*.scr",
                                   "*.pif", "*.hta", "*.bat", "*.zip" ] {
             # these attachment types are executable
             enclose :subject "Warning" "
   WARNING! The enclosed message contains executable attachments.
   These attachments types may contain a computer virus program
   that can infect your computer and potentently damage your data

   Before clicking on these message attachments, you should verify with
   the sender that this message was sent by them and not a computer virus.

             break;

Internet-Draft        Sieve Mime Test/Iterator/Etc.        February 2006


   Changed for.every.part to for_every_part.

   Added :anychild to mime test.  Default is to use the current context
   or outer envelope; specifying :anychild will look at all children.

   Added clarifications to replacing parts affecting the structure.

   Added :mime option to replace, ala draft-ietf-sieve-vacation-06.

   Various other minor nit fixes.

11.2.  draft-hansen-sieve-loop-01

   Merged with draft-daboo-sieve-mime-00.txt.
