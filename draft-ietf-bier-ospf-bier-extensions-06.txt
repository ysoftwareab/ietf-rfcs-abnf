                        OSPF Extensions for BIER
              draft-ietf-bier-ospf-bier-extensions-06.txt

Abstract

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that
   provides multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without
   requiring intermediate routers to maintain multicast related per-flow
   state.  Neither does BIER require an explicit tree-building protocol
   for its operation.  A multicast data packet enters a BIER domain at a
   "Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router" (BFIR), and leaves the BIER domain at
   one or more "Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers" (BFERs).  The BFIR router
   adds a BIER header to the packet.  Such header contains a bit-string
   in which each bit represents exactly one BFER to forward the packet
   to.  The set of BFERs to which the multicast packet needs to be
   forwarded is expressed by the according set of bits set in BIER
   packet header.

   This document describes the OSPF protocol extension required for BIER
   with MPLS encapsulation.

1.  Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that
   provides optimal multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without
   requiring intermediate routers to maintain any multicast related per-
   flow state.  Neither does BIER explicitly require a tree-building
   protocol for its operation.  A multicast data packet enters a BIER
   domain at a "Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router" (BFIR), and leaves the
   BIER domain at one or more "Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers" (BFERs).
   The BFIR router adds a BIER header to the packet.  The BIER header
   contains a bit-string in which each bit represents exactly one BFER
   to forward the packet to.  The set of BFERs to which the multicast
   packet needs to be forwarded is expressed by setting the bits that
   correspond to those routers in the BIER header.

   BIER architecture requires routers participating in BIER to exchange
   BIER related information within a given domain.  BIER architecture
   permits link-state routing protocols to perform distribution of such
   information.  This document describes extensions to OSPF necessary to
   advertise BIER specific information in the case where BIER uses MPLS
   encapsulation as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Flooding of the BIER Information in OSPF

   All BIER specific information that a Bit-Forwarding Router (BFR)
   needs to advertise to other BFRs is associated with a BFR-Prefix.  A
   BFR prefix is a unique (within a given BIER domain) routable IP
   address that is assigned to each BFR as described in more detail in
   section 2 of [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].

   Given that BIER information must be associated with a BFR prefix, the
   OSPF Extended Prefix Opaque LSA [RFC7684] has been chosen for
   advertisement.

2.1.  BIER Sub-TLV

   A Sub-TLV of the Extended Prefix TLV (defined in [RFC7684]) is
   defined for distributing BIER information.  The Sub-TLV is called the
   BIER Sub-TLV.  Multiple BIER Sub-TLVs may be included in the Extended
   Prefix TLV.

   The BIER Sub-TLV has the following format:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              Type             |             Length            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Sub-domain-ID |     MT-ID     |              BFR-id           |

      Sub-domain-ID: Unique value identifying the BIER sub-domain within
      the BIER domain, as described in section 1 of
      [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].

      MT-ID: Multi-Topology ID (as defined in [RFC4915]) that identifies
      the topology that is associated with the BIER sub-domain.

      BFR-id: A 2 octet field encoding the BFR-id, as documented in
      section 2 of [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].  If the BFR is not
      locally configured with a valid BFR-id, the value of this field is
      set to invalid BFR-id per [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].

   Each BFR sub-domain MUST be associated with one and only one OSPF
   topology that is identified by the MT-ID.  If the association between
   BIER sub-domain and OSPF topology advertised in the BIER sub-TLV by
   other BFRs is in conflict with the association locally configured on
   the receiving router, the BIER Sub-TLV MUST be ignored.

   If a BFR advertises the same Sub-domain-ID in multiple BIER sub-TLVs,
   the BRF MUST be treated as if it did not advertise a BIER sub-TLV for
   such sub-domain.

   All BFRs MUST detect advertisement of duplicate valid BFR-IDs for a
   given MT-ID and Sub-domain-ID.  When such duplication is detected all
   BFRs advertising duplicates MUST be treated as if they did not
   advertise a valid BFR-id.

2.2.  BIER MPLS Encapsulation Sub-TLV

   The BIER MPLS Encapsulation Sub-TLV is a Sub-TLV of the BIER Sub-TLV.
   The BIER MPLS Encapsulation Sub-TLV is used in order to advertise
   MPLS specific information used for BIER.  It MAY appear multiple
   times in the BIER Sub-TLV.

   The BIER MPLS Encapsulation Sub-TLV has the following format:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              Type             |             Length            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Lbl Range Size |                Label Range Base               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Internet-Draft          OSPF Extensions for BIER               June 2017


      Length: 4 octets

      Label Range Size: A 1 octet field encoding the label range size of
      the label range.  It MUST be greater then 0, otherwise the
      advertising router MUST be treated as if it did not advertise a
      BIER sub-TLV.

      Label Range Base: A 3 octet field, where the 20 rightmost bits
      represent the first label in the label range.

      Bit String Length: A 1 octet field encoding the supported
      BitString length associated with this BFR-prefix.  The values
      allowed in this field are specified in section 2 of
      [I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation].

      The "label range" is the set of labels beginning with the label
      range base and ending with ((label range base)+(label range size)-
      1).  A unique label range is allocated for each BitStream length
      and Sub-domain-ID.  These labels are used for BIER forwarding as
      described in [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] and
      [I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation].

      The size of the label range is determined by the number of Set
      Identifiers (SI) (section 1 of [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]) that
      are used in the network.  Each SI maps to a single label in the
      label range.  The first label is for SI=0, the second label is for
      SI=1, etc.

   If same BS length is repeated in multiple BIER MPLS Encapsulation
   Sub-TLV inside the same BIER Sub-TLV, the BIER sub-TLV MUST be
   ignored.

   Label ranges within all BIER MPLS Encapsulation Sub-TLV inside the
   same BIER Sub-TLV MUST NOT overlap.  If the overlap is detected, the
   advertising router MUST be treated as if it did not advertise a BIER
   sub-TLV.

   All advertised labels MUST be valid, otherwise the BIER sub-TLV MUST
   be ignored.

2.3.  Optional BIER Tree Type Sub-TLV

   This Sub-TLV carries the information associated with the supported
   BIER tree type for a sub-domain.  This Sub-TLV is optional and its
   absence has the same semantics as its presence with Tree Type value 0
   (SPF).  When Tree Type 0 is used, it is RECOMMENDED that this Sub-TLV
   is omitted in order to reduce the space consumed in the parent TLV.

Internet-Draft          OSPF Extensions for BIER               June 2017


   This Sub-TLV MAY occur no more than once in a BIER sub-TLV.  If
   multiple occurences of this Sub-TLV are present in a single BIER Sub-
   TLV, the BIER sub-TLV MUST be ignored.

   If the tree type (implied or explicitly advertised) does not match
   the locally configured tree type associated with the matching sub-
   domain, the BIER sub-TLV MUST be ignored.

      Type: TBD3.

      Length: 1 octet.

      Tree Type: 1 octet

2.4.  Flooding scope of BIER Information

   The flooding scope of the OSPF Extended Prefix Opaque LSA [RFC7684]
   that is used for advertising the BIER Sub-TLV is set to area-local.
   To allow BIER deployment in a multi-area environment, OSPF must
   propagate BIER information between areas.  The following procedure is
   used in order to propagate BIER related information between areas:

      When an OSPF Area Border Router (ABR) advertises a Type-3 Summary
      LSA from an intra-area or inter-area prefix to all its attached
      areas, it will also originate an Extended Prefix Opaque LSA, as
      described in [RFC7684].  The flooding scope of the Extended Prefix
      Opaque LSA type will be set to area-local.  The route-type in the
      OSPF Extended Prefix TLV is set to inter-area.  When determining
      whether a BIER Sub-TLV should be included in this LSA, an OSPF ABR
      will:

         - Examine its best path to the prefix in the source area and
         find the advertising router associated with the best path to
         that prefix.

         - Determine if such advertising router advertised a BIER Sub-
         TLV for the prefix.  If yes, the ABR will copy the information
         from such BIER MPLS Sub-TLV when advertising BIER MPLS Sub-TLV
         to each attached area.

3.  Security Considerations

   Implementations must assure that malformed TLV and Sub-TLV
   permutations do not result in errors which cause hard OSPF failures.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The document requests three new allocations from the OSPF Extended
   Prefix sub-TLV registry as defined in [RFC7684].

      BIER Sub-TLV: TBD1

      BIER MPLS Encapsulation Sub-TLV: TBD2

      BIER Tree Type Sub-TLV: TBD3
