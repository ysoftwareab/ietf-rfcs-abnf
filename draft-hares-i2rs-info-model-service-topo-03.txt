               An Information model for service topology
              draft-hares-i2rs-info-model-service-topo-03

Abstract

   As stated in [I.D-ietf-sfc-problem-statement], the service overlay is
   independent of the network topology and allows operators to use
   whatever overlay or underlay they prefer and to locate service nodes
   in the network as needed.

   This document extends the general topology model concept defined in
   [I.D-medved-i2rs-topology-im] and focuses on defining information
   model for service topology.

1.  Introduction

   Network topology information can be collected from network by using
   IGP or BGP-LS [I.D-draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution].  Information
   model for network topology provided in [I.D-medved-i2rs-topology-im]
   is built based on such network topology information.

   A service specific overlay utilized by Service chaining creates the
   service topology.  The overlay creates a path between service
   function(SF) nodes.  Service functions can be co-located on one SF
   Node or physically separated across several SF Nodes with each having
   one or more Service Functions.  In either case, a service function
   may be running in its own virtualized system space or natively on the
   hosting system.

   Within the service topology, an ordered set of Service functions will
   be invoked for each packet that belongs to a given flow for which a
   SFC will be applied.  Adding new service function to SF Node in the
   topology is easily accomplished, and no underlying network changes
   are required.  Furthermore, additional service Functions or Service
   Function instances, for redundancy or load distribution purpose, can
   be added or removed to the service topology as required.

   As stated in [I.D-ietf-sfc-problem-statement], the service overlay is
   independent of the network topology and allows operators to use

   whatever overlay or underlay they prefer and to locate service nodes
   in the network as needed.

   This document extends the general topology model concept defined in
   [I.D-medved-i2rs-topology-im] and focuses on defining information
   model for service topology.

3.  Service Topology Information Model

   This section specifies the service topology information model in
   Routing Backus-Naur Form (RBNF, [RFC5511]).  It also provides
   diagrams of the main entities that the information model is comprised
   of.

3.1.  Model Overview

   The abstract Topology Model contain a set of abstract nodes and a
   list of abstract links.  An abstract link connects two abstract
   nodes.  Service Function Chain Topo model and other service topo
   model can be augumented from the abstract topology model with
   topology specifics.

                            +---------+

   The basic information model works as follows: A service topology
   contains service nodes and segments.  A segment connects two nodes (a
   source and a destination)and have direction, may be unidirectional or
   bidirectional. unidirectional is one where traffic is passed through
   any two service node or a set of service nodes in one forwarding
   direction only.  Bidirectional is one where traffic is passed through
   any two service nodes or a set of service nodes in both forwarding
   directions.  Each serivce node contains termination points.  It
   occurs before or after other service node, therefore each node may
   have its upstream service node and/or downstream service node.

   A service node may be dedicated to a tenant(e.g., an IPVPN customer),
   globally shared among tenants, or available to be assigned in whole
   or in part to a tenant or a set of tenants.  Therefore service Nodes
   can map onto and be supported by other network elements in the
   underlying network, while Segment can map onto and be supported by
   other links in the underlying network,e.g., one segment can be mapped
   to two consecutive links stitching together.  Service Topologies can
   map onto other, underlay topologies.

   The information model for the Service-Topology component is more
   formally shown in the following diagram.

   The elements of the Service-Topology information model are as
   follows:

   o  A service overlay can contain multiple topologies.  Each topology
      is captured in its own list element, distinguished via a topology-
      id.

   o  A topology has a certain type, such as NETCONF or I2RS.  A
      topology can even have multiple types simultaneously.  The type,
      or types, are captured in the list of "topology-type" components.

   o  A topology contains segments and nodes, each captured in their own
      list.

   o  A node has a node-id.  This distinguishes the node from other
      nodes in the list.  In addition, a node has a list of termination
      points, used to terminate segment.  An examples of a termination
      point might be a physical or logical port or, more generally, an
      interface.

   o  A segment is identified by a segment-identifier, uniquely
      identifying the portion of the network bounded by two service
      nodes within the topology. segment are point-to- point and has
      direction.  The direction can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
      Accordingly, a segment contains a source and a destination.  Both
      source and destination reference a corresponding node, as well as
      a termination point on that node.

   o  The topology, node, segment and direction elements can be extended
      with topology-specific components (topology-extensions, node-
      extension, segment-extension and direction-extension
      respectively).

   The topology model includes segment that are either bidirectional
   unidirectional.  Service function chain path is analogue to linked
   list data structure and can be represented through a set of Ordered
   segments from source to destination.  Each node in the service
   overlay may be located at different layer.  The segment can be setup

   to steer traffic through these specific service nodes at different
   layers or bypass some specific service nodes at different layers.

   The topology model only supports point to point and does not support
   multipoint.  Therefore Segments are terminated by a single
   termination point, not sets of termination points.  Connections
   involving multihoming or segment aggregation schemes need to be
   modeled using multiple point-to-point segment,e.g., connection from
   service node A at lower layer to service node D at higher layer can
   comprise a segment 1 from service node A to service node B and
   segment 2 from service node B to service node C and segment 3 from
   service node C to service node D.  By using segment aggregation, we
   can define a new segment from service A to service node D which is
   supported by segment 1,2 and 3.

   Unlike network topology collection, the service topology information
   may be not available from each SF by using IGP advertisement or BGP-
   LS northbound distribution since SF may be not located at network
   layer.  However these SF at different layer may have affinity with
   one SF node(e.g., SF egress node or SF ingress node or SF enabled
   node),therefore service topology information associated with Service
   nodes can be collected using RESTCONF/NETCONF interface or I2RS
   interface for interrogation of a virtual device's state, statistics
   and configuration.

   is defined as the component, "inventory database".  This component
   defines a set of groupings with auxiliary information required and
   shared by those other components.
