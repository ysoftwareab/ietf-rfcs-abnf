                Firmware Encryption with SUIT Manifests
             draft-tschofenig-suit-firmware-encryption-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a firmware update mechanism where the
   firmware image is encrypted.  This mechanism uses the IETF SUIT
   manifest with key establishment provided by the hybrid public-key
   encryption (HPKE) scheme or AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) with a pre-shared
   key-encryption key.  In either case, AES-GCM or AES-CCM is used for
   firmware encryption.

1.  Introduction

   Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the
   need for a reliable and secure firmware update mechanism that is also
   suitable for constrained devices.  To protect firmware images the
   SUIT manifest format was developed [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest].  The
   SUIT manifest provides a bundle of metadata about the firmware for an
   IoT device, where to find the firmware image, and the devices to
   which it applies.

   The SUIT information model [I-D.ietf-suit-information-model] details
   the information that has to be offered by the SUIT manifest format.
   In addition to offering protection against modification, which is
   provided by a digital signature or a message authentication code, the
   firmware image may also be afforded confidentiality using encryption.

Internet-Draft             Firmware Encryption                  May 2021


   Encryption prevents third parties, including attackers, from gaining
   access to the firmware image.  For example, return-oriented
   programming (ROP) requires intimate knowledge of the target firmware
   and that encryption makes this approach much more difficult to
   exploit.  The SUIT manifest provides the data needed for authorized
   recipients of the firmware image to decrypt it.

   A symmetric cryptographic key is established for encryption and
   decryption, and that key can be applied to a SUIT manifest, firmware
   images, or personalization data, depending on the encryption choices
   of the firmware author.  This symmetric key can be established using
   a variety of mechanisms; this document defines two approaches for use
   with the IETF SUIT manifest.  Key establishment can be provided by
   the hybrid public-key encryption (HPKE) scheme or AES Key Wrap (AES-
   KW) with a pre-shared key-encryption key.  These choices reduce the
   number of possible key establishment options for interoperability of
   different SUIT manifest implementations.  The document also offers a
   number of examples for developers.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes familiarity with the IETF SUIT manifest
   [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest] and the SUIT architecture [RFC9019].

   The terms "recipient" and "firmware consumer" are used
   interchangeably.

   Additionally, the following abbreviations are used in this document:

   -  Key Wrap (KW), defined in RFC 3394 [RFC3394] for use with AES.

   -  Key-encryption key / key-encrypting key (KEK), a term defined in
      RFC 1949 [RFC1949].

   -  Content-encryption key (CEK), a term defined in RFC 2630
      [RFC2630].

   -  Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE), defined in
      [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke].

3.  AES Key Wrap

   The AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) algorithm is described in RFC 3394
   [RFC3394], and it can be used to encrypt a randomly generated
   content-encryption key (CEK) with a pre-shared key-encryption key
   (KEK).  The COSE conventions for using AES-KW are specified in
   Section 12.2.1 of [RFC8152].  The encrypted CEK is carried in the
   COSE_recipient structure alongside the information needed for AES-KW.
   The COSE_recipient structure, which is a substructure of the
   COSE_Encrypt, contains the CEK encrypted by the KEK.  When the
   firmware image is encrypted for use by multiple recipients, the
   COSE_recipient structure will contain one encrypted CEK if all of the
   authorized recipients have access to the KEK.

   However, the COSE_recipient structure can contain the same CEK
   encrypted with many different KEKs if needed to reach all of the
   authorized recipients.

   Note that the AES-KW algorithm, as defined in Section 2.2.3.1 of
   [RFC3394], does not have public parameters that vary on a per-
   invocation basis.  Hence, the protected structure in the
   COSE_recipient is a byte string of zero length.

   The COSE_Encrypt conveys information for encrypting the firmware
   image, which includes information like the algorithm and the IV, even
   though the firmware image is not embedded in the
   COSE_Encrypt.ciphertext itself since it conveyed as detached content.

   The CDDL for the COSE_Encrypt_Tagged structure is shown in Figure 1.

   authenticated data structure to be created, which is defined as shown
   in Figure 2.

              Figure 2: CDDL for Enc_structure Data Structure

   As it can be seen in the CDDL in Figure 1, there are two protected
   fields and the 'protected' field in the Enc_structure, see Figure 2,
   refers to the outer protected field, not the protected field of the
   COSE_recipient structure.

   The value of the external_aad is set to null.

   The following example illustrates the use of the AES-KW algorithm
   with AES-128.

   We use the following parameters in this example:

   -  IV: 0x26, 0x68, 0x23, 0x06, 0xd4, 0xfb, 0x28, 0xca, 0x01, 0xb4,
      0x3b, 0x80

   -  KEK: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"

   -  KID: "kid-1"

   -  Plaintext Firmware: "This is a real firmware image."

   The COSE_Encrypt structure in hex format is (with a line break
   inserted):

4.  Hybrid Public-Key Encryption (HPKE)

   Hybrid public-key encryption (HPKE) [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke] is a scheme
   that provides public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts
   given a recipient's public key.

   For use with firmware encryption the scheme works as follows: The
   firmware author uses HPKE, which internally utilizes a non-
   interactive ephemeral-static Diffie-Hellman exchange to derive a
   shared secret, which is then used to encrypt plaintext.  In the
   firmware encryption scenario, the plaintext passed to HPKE for
   encryption is a randomly generated CEK.  The output of the HPKE
   operation is therefore the encrypted CEK along with HPKE encapsulated
   key (i.e. the ephemeral ECDH public key of the author).  The CEK is
   then used to encrypt the firmware.

   Only the holder of recipient's private key can decapsulate the CEK to
   decrypt the firmware.  Key generation is influced by additional
   parameters, such as identity information.

   This approach allows us to have all recipients to use the same CEK to
   encrypt the firmware image, in case there are multiple recipients, to
   fulfill a requirement for the efficient distribution of firmware
   images using a multicast or broadcast protocol.

   The CDDL for the COSE_Encrypt structure as used with HPKE is shown in
   Figure 4.

   is accomplished with the HPKE encryption function as shown in

   Legend:

   -  The functions DeserializePublicKey(), SetupBaseS() and Seal() are
      defined in HPKE [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke].

   -  CEK is a random byte sequence of keysize length whereby keysize
      corresponds to the size of the indicated symmetric encryption
      algorithm used for firmware encryption.  For example, AES-128-GCM
      requires a 16 byte key.  The CEK would therefore be 16 bytes long.

   -  'recipient_public_key' represents the public key of the recipient.

   -  'info' is a data structure described below used as input to the
      key derivation internal to the HPKE algorithm.  In addition to the
      constant prefix, the COSE_KDF_Context structure is used.  The
      COSE_KDF_Context is shown in Figure 6.

   The result of the above-described operation is the encrypted CEK
   (denoted as ciphertext) and the enc - the HPKE encapsulated key (i.e.
   the ephemeral ECDH public key of the author).

   -  PartyUInfo.identity corresponds to the kid found in the
      COSE_Sign_Tagged or COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure (when a digital
      signature is used.  When utilizing a MAC, then the kid is found in
      the COSE_Mac_Tagged or COSE_Mac0_Tagged structure.

   -  PartyVInfo.identity corresponds to the kid used for the respective
      recipient from the inner-most recipients array.

   -  The value in the AlgorithmID field corresponds to the alg
      parameter in the protected structure in the inner-most recipients
      array.

   -  keyDataLength is set to the number of bits of the desired output
      value.

   -  protected refers to the protected structure of the inner-most
      array.

   The author encrypts the firmware using the CEK with the selected
   algorithm.

   The recipient decrypts the received ciphertext, i.e. the encrypted
   CEK, using two input parameters:

   -  the private key skR corresponding to the public key pkR used by
      the author when creating the manifest.

   -  the HPKE encapsulated key (i.e. ephemeral ECDH public key) created
      by the author.

   If the HPKE operation is successful, the recipient obtains the CEK
   and can decrypt the firmware.

   Figure 7 shows the HPKE computations performed by the recipient for
   decryption.

       info = "cose hpke" || 0x00 || COSE_KDF_Context
       context = SetupBaseR(ciphertext, skR, info)
       CEK = context.Open(null, ciphertext)

5.  Complete Examples

   TBD: Add example for complete manifest here (which also includes the
   digital signature).  TBD: Add multiple recipient example as well.
   TBD: Add encryption of manifest (in addition of firmware encryption).

6.  Security Considerations

   The algorithms described in this document assume that the firmware
   author

   -  has either shared a key-encryption key (KEK) with the firmware
      consumer (for use with the AES-Key Wrap scheme), or

Internet-Draft             Firmware Encryption                  May 2021


   -  is in possession of the public key of the firmware consumer (for
      use with HPKE).

   Both cases require some upfront communication interaction, which is
   not part of the SUIT manifest.  This interaction is likely be
   provided by a IoT device management solution, as described in
   [RFC9019].

   For AES-Key Wrap to provide high security it is important that the
   KEK is of high entropy, and that implementations protect the KEK from
   disclosure.  Compromise of the KEK may result in the disclosure of
   all key data protected with that KEK.

   Since the CEK is randomly generated, it must be ensured that the
   guidelines for random number generations are followed, see [RFC8937].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to create new entries in the COSE
   Algorithms registry established with [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs].
