Abstract




   This paper, opening with the historical that documents the source
   of the Binary Enumeration Error, utilizes the proof of 'Fermat's
   Last Theorem' (Normative References - [1], [2] and [3]), the
   Mathematics of Quantification, and the Logic of Set Theory, to
   prove that the Binary System represents a 'Closed and Finite'
   Alternate Mathematical Field. That is, using the Elementary Laws
   of Algebra, with the Basic Principles from Analytic Geometry,
   provides the final clarification simplifying the proof for the
   correction of the Counting Errors and the Logical Foundation for
   the New Binary System. And more importantly, this also establishes
   the basic foundational principles for 3 State Ternary Logic. In
   other words, using an askew, or mathematically incorrect Binary
   System, defined as the misinterpretation of ZERO, sustains the
   Counting Error (an Accumulating Propagation) levying a substantial
   loss of IP Addresses in the IPv4 IP Specification, affecting as
   well the Address Pool Total for the IPv6 Specification. Hence,
   from the foregoing foundation an unquestionable proof concludes;
   the Elementary Mathematical 'Resolution of the Counting Error in
   the Binary System’ & the 'Fall of Differential Calculus' -
   [4. IANA Considerations].

Introduction


   The investigation of the origin of the Binary System revealed
   that Leibniz, its principle author, is responsible for the
   askew error, because he never understood or actually developed
   a Binary System of counting. And this is clearly shown to be
   the handicap that not only resulted in the Loss of available
   IP Addresses in the IPv4 Specification, but it contributed to
   the difficulties preventing the development of the Binary and
   Ternary Relations defined by Boolean Algebra. That is, by
   clearly showing that this is a Closed Finite Mathematical
   System, which defines an incremental progression using ' 1's '.
   This greatly simplified the Boolean Mathematical Relationships
   for the 'Theory of Three State Logic', and corrected the error
   in Binary Enumeration, which generated the loss of IP Addresses
   in the IPv4 Specification. In other words, the proof of
   "Fermat's Last Theorem" defines a special case of the
   Distributive Law, which is defined in the mathematical logic
   of Set Theory, as the Intersection of the two Universal Sets
   that represents the Binary and the Unary Systems. And this
   conclusively proves, that there are only Two logical
   Systems of Counting, which are mathematically viable.

1.  The Beginnings of Binary Enumeration




   The History of the Binary System has its recorded beginnings
   starting about the 5th century BC. But, there is a problem with
   this recorded date, because the historians have not defined, or
   established an agreement regarding what they mean jointly, or
   independently, when they are referencing the development of the
   Binary System. In other words, for many people, specifically
   mathematicians, when they speak or make reference to the Binary
   System, they are talking about mathematics. The Binary System,
   as a Mathematical System actually did not come into fruition
   until the 1600. That is, from the 5th Century to the 1600, what
   is thought to be a Binary System for Mathematical Enumeration,
   was in fact, either a system of Drum Beats for communications,
   a system of Open and Closed Bars used for counting, or a system
   for distinguishing musical notes in musical compositions. In
   any case, each of these so called Binary Systems shared the
   same flaw; they skew the counting by the misrepresentation of
   the Binary equivalent of '1'.

   1.1    Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz's Binary System


    The general consensus regarding Leibniz would contend that,
    he made significant contributions to the foundations of
    Mathematics, Philosophy, and the beginnings of Set Theory.
    However, because he was indeed, a man of the times, Leibniz
    was occupied by a broad range of subjects. Nonetheless, while
    he did make significant contributions to humanity, an
    investigation of some of his most noted contributions would
    show that he did not completely finish the work for closure
    of the proposed subject(s). That is, I am of the opinion that,
    for most of his life, Leibniz was looking for the pieces of
    his puzzle, the clues or solution to clarify the concerns
    involving his ongoing research in the areas of Philosophy,
    Logic, and Metaphysics (The Laws and Logic of Critical
    Thinking). Needless to say, my opinion is evinced more
    clearly by the study of the works from one of his
    contemporaries, Perrie de Fermat, and the man most
    profoundly influenced by his research in Metaphysics,
    George Boole.

    Nevertheless, while Leibniz correctly translated the
    symbolisms for enumeration, as presented in the book of I
    Ching, into a Binary System of counting, which was similar
    to the Unary System. However, the reality of this
    accomplishment is that, his only achievement was the 'Ø'
    and the '1' solution to his problem concerning his
    Metaphysical Research, which pertained to the Logical
    Analysis for the presentation of 'The Laws and Logic of
    Critical Thinking'. In which case, had he either knew, or
    fully understood that Numerology, or Number Theory in
    general, involved the Logical Analysis of the Elementary
    Laws of Mathematics. He probably would have correctly
    completed his Numbering System, and 'Fermat's Last
    Theorem' would not have become one of the greatest, from
    a historical perspective, Mathematical Enigmas of all
    times. In any case, since 'Fermat's Last Theorem' was not
    solved until November 1979, there was no logical
    connection ever established between the works of Fermat
    and Leibniz. Hence, in the absence of a logical reason
    for a comparable analysis, there was no reason to
    question the validity of Leibniz's numerical translation.
    In other words, the Modern Binary System, as depicted in
    figure 1, is the direct consequence from the work of



E Terrell                   Internet Draft                     [Page 6]

    Leibniz, and it remains logically incorrect. This is because,
    the discovery of the solution to the problem that qualified
    as the logical reason for the comparable analysis questioning
    his results, from the mathematical perspective, it violates
    the laws from elementary mathematics, the Field Postulates,
    the Axioms for Equality, and the logical foundation of
    Set Theory.

   1.2         George Boole's Mathematical Logic


    The influence of Leibniz upon George Boole is unquestionable,
    however, Boole's greatest contribution to mathematics
    overshadows considerably, his retake on objectives of
    Leibniz's life's work. In other words, Boole's work; "An
    investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are founded
    the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probability", is a
    mathematical and logical marvel that clearly renders a
    rational demystification of the Metaphysical rhetoric
    encompassing the logic of the 'Ø' and the '1' foundation,
    which was the hallmark of Leibniz pursuit to resolve 'The
    Laws and the Logic Foundation of Critical Thinking'. Still,
    George Boole was unaware of the contributions he made to
    Mathematics and the Mathematical Sciences, because it was
    embedded in his most famous work; "An investigation of
    the Laws of Thought on which are founded the Mathematical
    Theories of Logic and Probability". Furthermore, while
    using the principle foundation of the '0'and the '1'
    concepts created by Leibniz, Boole correctly established
    an Algebraic and Logical Foundation that was later to
    have applications throughout the fields Computer Science
    and Electronics. However, the result from Boole's work
    was wrongly interpreted as the 'Logic of the Binary
    System', when in fact, it is actually 'The Logic of the
    Unary System', because only One State Works, or because
    only One Stated Condition can be True, as shown in
    Figure 2.

    Nevertheless, given that an argument can be made claiming
    the existence of Two States, '0' and '1'. However, not until
    it is realized that Boole's ascribes to a literal usage,
    using their actual numeral values, it will then become
    understood that a Unary System is a Two State System,
    because it is a System of Counting uses '1s' to represent
    something and a '0' to represent nothing: 'Hence, A Two
    State System'. So, the question of ponder that one might
    ask is: 'If the number of States in the Logic of the
    Modern Binary System equals that of the Unary System.
    How many States defined by Boolean Relationships does the
    True Binary System have ...??... Figure 3.

   1.3   The Arithmetical Error and the flaw in Binary Enumeration



    While it should be quite clear that a fundamental knowledge of
    Archaeology, Anthropology, and perhaps a knowledge of the early
    Languages, should be the perquisite required for the study of any
    ancient Civilization. Still, there should never be any doubts,
    because if there was a Civilization whose first system of counting
    was a True Binary System this would probably be the most advanced
    Civilization in the Universe. In other words, because of the
    inherent complexities involved in the meaning and the
    interpretation of the concept of Zero, the development of a True
    Binary System by any Ancient or Primitive Civilization borders on
    the Highly Unlikely, or the Impossible. In which case, prior to
    Leibniz's discovery of the Two State Logical System for his
    Metaphysical Analysis of Critical Thinking, I cannot accept as
    being possible, that any Civilization before this time could have
    created or fully understood the Mathematical nuances of the Binary
    System. The case in point, the mathematical error discovered in
    1999, which clearly defined a mathematical discrepancy between two
    different Binary Mathematical Systems. However, it is also quite
    obvious that know one since Leibniz, could either rationalize this
    difference, or understood why a difference occurred. And while the
    most notable self-righteous and unspoken claims, under the guise of
    Religion, Politics, Racial, or Economic deprivation /
    discrimination, for every Civilization since mankind’s beginnings,
    has been the horrifyingly torturous control and exploits of its
    people. Yet, even with the persistence of these living conditions
    today, it is still difficult not wonder, how, or why it is possible
    for a blunder having such simple a solution, could have lasted for
    so long.  ...???...


    In other words, the pointed reality of this discrepancy ask
    the question: 'Is it possible for a one-to-correspondence of
    a Set X, with the Set of Integers, I, which yields the count
    of the total number of members the Set X contains, to have
    more than one value to represented in the Set I?' {... No!}
    That is, it is not possible for any one-to-one pairing
    between the members of two Sets, the Set X, and the Set I,
    for any member contained in any one of the two Sets to have
    more than one pairing with the members of the other Set. And
    this is because, such a pairing establishes a count that can
    be translated into a equality, when both Sets, given in Table
    I, are said to represent the same (Identical) method for
    enumeration.

    In any case, to say the very least, it should be quite clear
    from the examination of Table I, that if a given Binary
    Number, say, '11111111', has two Integral Values, '255'
    and '256', there is a undeniable problem with the Binary
    System when it is used as a System of Counting. Still,
    anyone, and with good reason, could quite easily present
    the excuse; "It is a Typo-Graphical Error!", as a viable
    opposing argument. However, such an argument would easily
    fail, because there is absolutely No proof, if
    {a, b} = {0, 1}, which would now account for the existence
    of the 4 conditions that must clearly represent a number;
    Substitution Law for Equality now yields,{a, a}, {a, b},
    {b, a}, and {b, b} given in Table II. Especially since, it
    is evident in this scenario that Zero cannot be equal to

    either '0', or the Null Set, (Out of Sight, Out of the
    Conscience thought ... Does not exist!) because 'a' in the real
    sense of reality, references something tangible. Furthermore,
    when comparing the three rows from Table I, it is also evident
    that there is a common coefficient between different
    numerical representations, which are equal to the same number.
    But, this assessment is only valid between the members of
    columns 2 and 3 in Table I, and conditionally valid between
    the members of columns 1, 2, and 3, in Table II.



     Note: The unfortunate reality of Table II, is that, the New
           Binary System impacts Gregor Mendel's work in Genetics.
           In other words, from an 'A a' and 'B b' paring,
           {A, a, B, b}, Mendel's results referenced only 6 of
           the possible 16* combinations; {A, A}, {B, B}, {A, B},
           {B, b} {A, a}, and {a, b}. However, while I have not
           wrote the New Foundation representing Finite Chemistry,
           the reality of the mathematical results from the
           Mathematics of Quantification now questions the
           validity of Mendel's claims. In any case, it has been
           proven, using the current foundation, that the order
           of the addition of Chemicals is a vital consideration
           for the determination of the Chemistry of the
           resulting Chemical Compound (10 combinations are
           missing*). Still, what's alarming? Well.
           ...considering the 'X' and 'Y' Chromosomes that
           represent this relationship. This also suggest the
           possibility of an error in the Chromosome Count
           defining the Base Pairs; A = adenosine, C = cytosine,
           G = guanine, and T = thymine, given that they current
           identify 23  +  23  =  46 Chromosomes. That is, from
           the Mathematics of Quantification this defines,
           2^5  +  2^5  =  2^6  =  64  =  8^2 Chromosomes, four
           pairs of 8 Bit Bases Pairs, or 32  +  32  =  64, that
           yields about 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 Bases, which
           translates into two 8^10 pairs of 8 Bit Bases Pairs
           per Cell of human DNA. (et 2004)

    Nevertheless, while studying the analysis from Tables III and
    IV, recall the former proofs, because it was clearly shown
    that if '00 = aa = 1', and '01 = ab = 02', and the Exponent
    'F = either a Rational or Irrational Number, then the Binary
    Translation could only equal the Binary Representation for
    the Number. This meant, the exponent 'F' was not a whole
    Number. However, when the result from the sequential variable
    of the exponent having a of base '2' equaled the value of a
    whole number, and the exponent was also a whole number, then
    given that 'Multiplication is the Quantified Sum of Addition',
    the the value of the exponent equaled the sum of the Binary
    1's and the Product of the Binary 1's equaled the Binary
    Number and the Unary Number. That is,





       because '2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 128 = 1111111 = 2^7'


       and '2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 256 = 11111111 = 2^8',





    there is clearly a relationship between the columns in Table
    IV, and since (2 + 2) = (2 x 2), it shall be proven in Part
    II, not only that the established proof for the New Binary
    System remains correct. But, that its validity is derived
    from the proof of 'Fermat's Last Theorem' and the discovery
    of the 'Distributive Law for Exponential Functions'.
    Nevertheless, this proves that the differences between
    Tables III and IV clearly do not represent a Contradiction,
    the necessary requirement as stated by "Chief Executive
    Administrator for The Electronic Library of Mathematics",
    Aleksandar Perovic, when he said: "Mathematicians do not
    accept claims at truth of any possible, non-selfcontradictory
    (= consistent) mathematical system". Needless to say, while
    this difference is not a Contradiction, it is indeed a
    troubling Inconsistency which at the very least, warrants an
    investigation.

2.  The Unary and The Binary Mathematical Systems



    Throughout mankind's beginnings, there has been several
    different Systems of Counting, several different methods
    for performing elementary arithmetic, and an equal number
    symbols for those that were written, as well as the variety
    of sounds for those that were only spoken. However, only one
    numbering system, which is nearly complete, survived the
    trials of mankind's journey towards civilization; 'The Unary
    System'. And while the Laws from the Axioms for Equality,
    the Field Postulates, and Logic of Set Theory, which are
    an essential part of Unary System, was not developed until
    long after its discovery, sometime during the early and mid
    1800's. Still, it doubtful that anyone before 1979, tested
    the validity of the Unary System. Needless to say, it
    should be quite clear now, that every System of Enumeration
    must comply with the Laws from the Axioms for Equality, the
    Field Postulates, and Logic of Set Theory before it can ever
    be accepted as a valid System of Counting, which conforms to
    the elementary laws of arithmetic. In other words, the
    additional requirement, which any civilization must meet to
    claim the creation or the development of a True Binary
    System, is one that requires a prior the knowledge of the
    Unary System. If not, how could anyone justify the use of
    two objects to account for only one material possession...
    Hence, to use a Stick to represent the summation of an
    arithmetic progression incremented by the addition of 1,
    is far simpler than the use or discovery of the 'Stick
    and a Rock', which is used to represent the same
    incremented addition. Clearly, if this were not the case,
    then the Binary System would not have, after its initial
    claim of discovery, to wait 2500 years to become a True
    Binary System.

   2.1   Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem; and The Two Distributive
         Laws



    It is extremely amazing that it required more than 300 years
    after 'Perrie de Fermat' composed, before his death in 1665,
    a riddle involving an elementary algebraic equation, which
    eluded everyone, including the greatest mathematicians, to
    find, in 1979, a solution. A joke? Perhaps. But, Fermat was
    the first to claim, while writing this riddle, that he knew
    the simple solution. And clearly, if this were true, which I
    believe that it is, then perhaps, "Fermat's Last Theorem"
    should rightfully be called; 'the greatest joke of all times'.
    However, while I accept Fermat's claim, I do not believe that
    he actually knew, or fully understood, the profound
    implications of his discovery. Especially since, it may be
    concluded, as presented below, there are only 3 logically
    viable 'Interconnected Complimentary Solutions' that would
    solve the riddle regarding why;




      "There are No solutions in Whole Numbers to the Equation,

                    X^N + Y^N = Z^N, when N > 2".



   1. There is no Common Coefficient between the Sum of Two
      Exponents, the Exponent equaling their Result, and their
      respective Roots, when 'N > 2' , and 'N' defines the
      Exponent of the base variables. (Equal Number of Parts
      Contained in the Whole.)

   2. Fermat's Solution defines how he interpreted the problem,
      which is based upon the current mathematical knowledge
      known during his time, Pythagoras Theorem, and the
      Analytical Geometric solution(s) explaining the Difference
      regarding (the Geometric Shapes of Objects) 'Why', when
      'N = 2'; 'The Sum of the Area of two Perfect Squares Equals
      the Area of another Perfect Square'.
      
   -  Or  -

      "The Sum of the Area(s) of TWO Squares having equal
       Integer Sides, equals the Area of another Square having
       equal Sides that are Integers."

      And, when 'N = N', 'The Sum of the Areas of two Perfect
      Nth Powers is not Equal to the 'ROOT' defining the Area of
      a Perfect Nth Power'. Nevertheless, this assumption builds
      an explanation that explains this difference, which is
      believed to be the foundation for the proof that Fermat
      claimed would not fit in the margin of his paper, but
      would explain why, when 'N > 2', his theorem is true.






   3. In Exponential Operations, there is No equal Distribution
      of Multiplication over Addition when 'N > 2', and 'N'
      defines the value of the Exponent. (The Discovery of
      the Distributive Law for Exponential Functions, and the
      Foundation for the Finite Mathematical Field: "The
      Rudiments of Finite Algebra; The Results of
      Quantification".)

    Nevertheless, proof that it is assumed Fermat was thinking
    about, would be something like this, when 'N = 2':



    ""If the Length of the Side of a Perfect Square inscribing
      another Perfect Square is equal to 'X + Y', then the Sum
      of the Areas of Two Perfect Squares is equal to the Area
      of the Perfect Square inscribing another Perfect Square,
      and since the Area of a Square is given by;


             1.    'L x W = Area',



      the Area of the Inscribing Perfect Square, from the
      Mathematics of Quantification is given as;


         2.    (X + Y) x (X + Y) = (X + Y)^2 = X^2 + 2XY + Y^2


      And if the Length of the Side of the inscribed Perfect
      Square is equal to 'Z', and the Area of this Perfect
      Square is given by equation 1, then from Pythagoras
      Theorem, 'Z' is the Root of the equation given by;


             3.    X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2 = L x W = Z x Z

     Hence, the 'X, Y, and Z' variables, by Pythagoras Theorem now
     equals the Sides of the 4 Right Triangles forming, or Creating
     the Boarders of the Inscribing Perfect Square and the Perfect
     Square it inscribes. That is, if the Length of the Two Sides
     joining the 90 degree angle of the Right Triangle equals 1/4
     the Length of the Perimeter of the Inscribing Perfect Square,
     then the Sum of the X and Y variables defining the Two Sides
     of the Right Triangle equals the Length of the Side of the
     Inscribing Perfect Square. And given by equation 4, we have;




                4.    X + Y = Y + X, which means:




      If the Sum of the Length of the Two Sides, 'X + Y', of a
      Right Triangle forming the Right Angled boarder of any
      Perfect Square having Four Equal Sides, is equal to 1/2 the
      Length of its Perimeter, then the Sum of the Length of the Two
      Equal Sides, which are Integers, of any Right Triangle, is equal
      to 1/2 the Length of the Perimeter defining a Perfect Square
      having Four Equal Sides that are Integers.
      (The Commutative Law for Addition; "X + Y = Y + X". ET 2004)






    'And clearly, I can now conclude, Fermat, being the co-discoverer
    of Analytic Geometry, only knew of some of the methods of
    Euclidian Geometry, and most, if not all of the Algebraic methods
    known during his time. Furthermore, the foregoing is evinced more
    clearly when it is realized that Fermat never associated the Two
    Digit System of Plotting a One Number Point with Binary
    Enumeration, yet, he clearly understood the association between
    algebraic system for enumeration and the definition of the point
    presented by Euclid. In other words, while he clearly understood
    the algebra and the geometry defining the shapes of the objects
    involved in his proof, he never grasps the connection between
    algebra and geometry established by Analytic Geometry.'

      Furthermore, if the Sum of the Length of the Two Sides,
      'X + Y' of any Right Triangle forming the boarder of any
      Perfect Square equals the Length of 2 of Sides of a Perfect
      Square defining the Closed shape of a Rectangular figure
      having Perpendicular Sides, then the boarders of the Perfect
      Square is defined by Four Equal Right Triangles. Hence, from
      Pythagoras Theorem, if of the Two Sides of the Right Triangles
      forming the boarders of the Perfect Square join to form the
      90 degree Right Angles connecting the 4 Sides of the Perfect
      Square, then the Two Sides of the Right Triangles must
      respectively Equal the Adjacent Side and the Side Opposite
      the Hypotenuse. Therefore, since the Right Triangles join the
      Sides of the Perfect Square, the connection of the Side forming
      the Hypotenuse of the Right Triangles must also meet, and be
      joined at 90 degree angles. And if the Four Right Triangles are
      equal, then the Length of Hypotenuse equals the Length of One
      Side of an Inscribed Perfect Square.

      In other words, this means that; The Sum of the Areas of
      Two Perfect Squares equals the Area of the Perfect Square
      Inscribing another Perfect Square, if and only if, The Sum
      of the Areas of the Four equal Right Triangles forming the
      boarders of the Inscribing Perfect Square and the Area of
      the Perfect Square it Inscribes, equals the Area of the
      Perfect Square Inscribing another Perfect Square. And from
      equation 5, the Area of a Triangle is given by;



                5.    1/2(b x h)



      And given that only the Adjacent Side and the Opposite
      Side of the Right Triangles can, respectively equal the
      Base, b, and the Height, h, then there are 4 Right Triangles
      having equal sides, X and Y, by equation 5, and the Area of the
      4 Right Triangles is given by;




                6.    4((1/2(X x Y) = 4/2(XY) = 2XY

The Ternary Logical States of the Binary System        October 28, 2006





      And from these results, it is easy to discern the equation
      for Sum of Areas of the 4 Right Triangles, as given by the
      equation;




                7.    (X - Y) x (X - Y) = X^2 - 2XY + Y^2, where



                8.    X^2 + Y^2 = 2XY





      Hence, the Area of the Perfect Square Inscribing a Perfect
      Square, which is equal to the Sum of the Areas of Two
      Perfect Squares, is given by;





          9.    (X + Y) x (X + Y) = X^2 + 2XY + Y^2 = 2XY + Z^2





      Therefore;




           10.    X^2 + Y^2 = 2XY - 2XY + Z^2 = X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2





      Thus, the equation, X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2, which is defined by
      Pythagoras Theorem, clearly states that the Sum of the
      Areas of Two Perfect Squares is equal to the Area of a
      Perfect Square"".

      And clearly, from his analysis, Fermat would have concluded
      the X and Y relations:




           11.   If X = Y, then X and Y are Two equal Perfect
                 Squares, and If X > Y, or Y > X, then X and Y
                 are Two different equally Perfect Squares.

    And from this analysis, Fermat would easily conclude that
    if the length of the Sides of a Perfect Cube are equal to
    that of a Perfect Square, when 'N = 3', then the Area of
    Cube is given by;



                12.    L x W x T = Area

The Ternary Logical States of the Binary System        October 28, 2006



    Hence, he would have also known, 'if the Area of a Cube, as given
    by equation 12, the Sides of the Perfect Cube are equal to that of
    a Perfect Square', then when 'N = 3', the Sides of the Perfect Cube
    must also be equal when the change in equation 12 is given by
    equation 13;



         13.    L  x W  x  T  =  Area  = X  x  Y  x  R  =  Z^3



    In other words, If the Root of Z^3 is equal to (X  +  Y), then
    the Area of a Perfect Cube, which inscribes another Perfect Cube
    is equal to the equation given by;



                14.    (X + Y)  x  (X + Y)  x  (X + Y)  =

                       (X + Y)  x  (X^2 + 2XY + Y^2) =

                        X^3 + 3YX^2 + 3XY^2 + Y^3



    Furthermore, he would have quickly noticed that a Perfect
    Cube has 8 90 degree Angles forming its boarders, or 4 pairs
    of 3 dimensional Right triangles, Prisms having 5, 2
    dimensional face. This he would have reasoned further, meant
    that, only a Pyramid could have 4 equal lengths measuring its
    sides. In other words, Fermat would have quickly concluded
    that, it is not possible for either any one of the 8, or 4
    pairs of Right Triangles forming the boarders of a Perfect
    Cube, could have equal sides, and still be a Right Triangle.
    Needless to say, he would have also known that this did not
    mean that the Sum of the Areas of these 3 dimensional Right
    Triangles did not equal the Area of a Perfect Cube.

    Nevertheless, he would continue to follow the logic from the
    conclusions involving 'N = 2' by first, confirming the formula
    for the Area of a 3 dimensional Triangle, to determine if the
    Sum of the Areas of Two Perfect Cubes is equal to the Area of
    another Perfect Cube. However, he would eventually notice,
    that while the Volume and the the Area of a Perfect Cube were
    equal formulas, the Volume and the Area of a 3 dimensional
    Triangle, or Prism, represented 2 different formulas. Where
    by, the Area of a 3 dimensional triangles is given by equation
    13a, the Volume of the same Triangle is given by equation 13b;

E Terrell                   Internet Draft                    [Page 26]

The Ternary Logical States of the Binary System        October 28, 2006





                14a.     Area of a Prism = A = 2(b^2) + 3b(h),
                         where b^2 = Area of base,
                         3b = b + b + b = Perimeter of base,
                         and h = Height of the Prism

                14b.    Volume of Traingle = V =
                        Area of the Base (B^2) x the Height (h) =
                        b^2h = b^2(h) = B^2 x h,
                        V = b^2(h)



    Clearly, while an argument can be made regarding the
    difference between the formulas in equations 14a and 14b,
    which represents the two distinct results that respectively
    measure the 'Area of a Prism' and the Volume of 3 dimensional
    Triangle. Even still, Fermat would have probably continued to
    follow the logical patterns reasoning derived from the
    conclusions when 'N = 2', because he could quite easily test
    for the conclusions that would verify either one, or both of
    these formulas. Thus, following the logical reasoning
    concluding equations 6, 7, and 8, in an attempt to derive the
    results that would conclude the Perfect Cube, which logically
    concludes results similar to that involving equations 9 and 10.

    Needless to say, I am hard pressed to imagine, but I seriously
    doubt that Fermat was surprised by his discovery, when trying
    to confirm equations 14a and 14b, that there are actually 5
    different formulas, which must be used in the logical analysis
    that would determine the validity of; 'The Sum of the Areas /
    Volume of Two Perfect Cubes are equal to the Area, or Volume of
    another Perfect Cube'. In any case, it should be understood
    that the Cubes of the 'X, Y, and Z' variables must be Positive
    Integers, because their respective Cube Roots must be a
    Positive Integer. Where by, given below, we have;





   15.    [(X + Y) x (X + Y)] X (X - Y) = X^3 + X^2y - XY^2 - Y^3



   16.    [(X - Y) x (X - Y)] X (X + Y) = X^3 - X^2y + XY^2 + Y^3

The Ternary Logical States of the Binary System        October 28, 2006




   17.    [(X - Y) x (X + Y)] X (X - Y) = X^3 - X^2y - XY^2 + Y^3



   18.    [(X - Y) x (X + Y)] X (X + Y) = X^3 + X^2y - XY^2 - Y^3





    And since by Definition;


             Exponent: Any symbolic representation, 'Q', which
                       is used in conjunction with the Number, 'X',
                       representing a Multiplicand, represents
                       the count of the number of Identical
                       Multiplicands used in the equation
                       representing Product of Q Multiplicands;
                       x^Q = (Xv1 x Xv2 x Xv3 x ... XvQ).



    Hence, given by equation 19, we have;



  19.    [(X - Y) x (X - Y)] X (X - Y) = X^3 - 3X^2y + 3XY^2 - Y^3




    Clearly, once Fermat realized, upon inspection of equations
    14a through 19, that neither the Sum of the Areas, or the
    Volumes of the Right Angled Prisms forming the Perimeter of
    the Perfect Cube equaled the factors from equation 12,
    '3X^2Y + 3XY^2', whose difference would yield the same
    conclusions established by equation 18. He would have
    reasoned that, 'The Sum of either the Area, or the Volume of
    Two Perfect Cubes did not equal another Perfect Cube',
    because there is a divergence diminishing the equality
    between factors in noted equations. And further testing, he
    would have reasoned, the divergence diminishing the equality
    between factors increases for every unit of increase of the
    Exponent, 'N'. Hence, he would finally concluded, since
    (2 + 2) = (2 x 2), "There are No solutions in Whole Numbers
    to the Equation, X^N + Y^N = Z^N,  when N > 2", because the
    Operation of Multiplication, M, is equal to the Operation of

E Terrell                   Internet Draft                    [Page 28]

The Ternary Logical States of the Binary System        October 28, 2006



    Addition, A, M = A, only when the number Variables involved
    in each of these operations, is equal to TWO. And the
    translation, or interpretation of this conclusion yields;



    'The Whole Number sought cannot be equal to the Cube Root of
     the Area of a Perfect Cube which is equal to the Sum of the
     Areas of Two Perfect Cubes, because then it will equal the
     Square Root for the Area of a Perfect Square, when it equals
     the Product of Two Equal Whole Numbers'.


 
    And since an equation of Multiplication is equal to an equation
    of Addition only when each of these operations involves two
    variables, then only an equation equaling Sum of the Two
    Variables equal to the Two Perfect Squares can equal the Product
    of the Two equal variables that is equal to a Perfect Square'.

    In which case, there is no Integer that can equal the Nth
    Root of the Nth Power that is equal to the equation of the
    Sum of Two Nth Powers. "In other words, since an equivalency
    between the Operations of Multiplication and Addition only
    exists at Power of 2 (denoting the number of Variables
    involved in both of these operations), then only the Sum
    of (in this case; Two) Perfect Squares can equal the
    product of the two equal multiplicands, which is equal to
    another Perfect Square, and still retain an integer
    solution for the values of the Variables representing
    Power of the Exponent and the respective Roots".



      Note: I investigated the same conditions, in the proof
            entitled; "The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem; The
            Revolution in Mathematical Thought". However, I
            concluded, from the same data, that "If 'N > 2' in
            the equation, X^N + Y^N = Z^N, then there are no
            Whole Number Solutions for the Nth Power of the
            Sum of Two Nth Powers and their respective Nth
            Roots". That is, because there is No incremental
            (Additive) progression using ' 1's ' defined for
            Fermat's / Pythagoras Equation, the Integer
            Coefficient, which is the Common Coefficient
            between the Powers of N and their respective Nth
            Roots do not exist. Nevertheless, this concludes
            the rendering of the proof, that I believe, Fermat
            understood to be True.

    Nevertheless, from the analysis of the forgoing conclusions,
    and the realization that equation 8 and the equation from
    "Fermat's Last Theorem", represented a special case defining
    the 'Distributive Law', as given by equations 19 through 24.
    That I also understood the profound meaning of the proof of
    "Fermat's Last Theorem". In other words, I reasoned first;
    'Any complete proof of "Fermat's Last Theorem" must be
    founded upon the 'Distributive Law', and conclude with the
    discovery of a New 'Distributive Property'. And this meant
    that when 'N > 2' in the equation, X^N + Y^N = Z^N, the
    Multiplication was not equally Distributed over the
    operation of Addition. Hence, from the results of equations
    19 through 24, it is was easy to conclude, since the
    Operation of Multiplication is not equally Distributed over
    Addition in the case where 'N > 2': There is no Common
    Coefficient between the Nth Power of the Sum of Two Nth
    Powers, and their respective Nth Roots. In which case, I
    concluded that Fermat was correct, and had the knowledge of
    proof I demonstrated above. However, Fermat's mathematical
    background lead me to conclude that he did not understand
    fully the implication of his riddle, because I believe, if
    he did, he would made a pointed reference.

   Special Case of the Distributive Law is the conclusion of
   Equation 25:




             20.    (X - Y)^2 =

                    (X - Y) × (X - Y) =

                     X^2 - 2XY + Y^2


             21.    X^2 + Y^2 =

                         2XY  =

                   XY  +  XY


             22.    (X + Y)^2 =

                    (X + Y) × (X + Y) =

                     X^2 + 2XY + Y^2


             23.    X^2 + 2XY + Y^2 =

                          2XY + Z^2


             24.    X2 + Y2 =

                    Z^2 + 2XY - 2XY =

                    X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2


             25.    Z^2 = 2XY:

                    hence, X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2

                    X^2 + Y^2 = 2XY

                    X^2 + Y^2 = XY + XY = X(Y + Y)

    Furthermore, because the conclusion from the proof and the
    equation involved in "Fermat's Last Theorem", represented
    an Algebraic Expression of the Exponential Function
    concluding the existence of the 'Distributive Law for
    Exponential / Non-Linear Functions.  I knew, or reasoned,
    since the Distributive Law is also logically valid in
    'Set Theory', that an Exponential Expansion of the
    Mathematical Logic of Set Theory must also sustain logical
    validity, and conclude the logical support for the
    conclusions derived from the foregoing proof: The Discovery
    of a New Distributive Property. Still, the clarification and
    definition of the Exponent, and the Exponential Operations
    employed in the Mathematical Logic of Set Theory, required
    more precise definitions of the familiar operations involving
    Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. In other
    words, the Exponential Expansion of Set Theory, which also
    logically sustains only the operations of Addition and
    Subtraction, nearly mirrors the proof of the 'Distributive
    for Exponential / Non-Linear Functions'. And the Exponential
    Expansion of the Field Postulates, concluded the existence
    of the Mathematics of Quantification, which is defined as a
    Finite Mathematical Field, conditionally closed over the Set
    'R' for the Operations involving Addition, Subtraction,
    Multiplication and Division.

  Multiplication: The Quantified Sum of the equal distribution of
  the Multiplicand, which is equal to the Addend that is used in
  the Summation of the equal Addends, which are equally
  distributed by a factor equal to the other Multiplicand that is
  used in the equation representing a product. "Hence,
  Multiplication is the Quantified Sum of Addition"


  5 x 14 = (14 + 14 + 14 + 14 + 14)
         = (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5)
         = 70



  Division: The Quantified Difference of an ever changing
  Dividend, which becomes the Subtrahend that is used in the
  repeated Subtractions performed on a Constant, which is the
  Divisor the becomes the Minuend in the equation. "Hence,
  Division is the Quantified Difference of the Repeated
  Subtraction performed on a Constant, which results in the
  Count of the Total Number of Parts Contained in the Whole.
  18/2 = 9, and Nine Subtractions of 2 from 18 equals;


     '(((((((((18 - 2) -2) -2) -2) -2) -2) - 2) - 2) - 2)'



  Addition: The mathematical operation representing a
  Summation, indicating a growth, or an increase in the
  number of the members contained in the Whole, by the
  inclusion of new members: The Union of Sets; 'U'.



  Subtraction: The mathematical operation representing a
  Difference, indicating a depreciation, or a reduction in
  the number of the members contained in the Whole, by the
  exclusion of members: The Disunion of Sets; 'BarU'.

                         The Definitions


  Disjoint:   If there are two sets, A and B, such that, A and B
              share no common members, then the two sets are said
              to be Disjoint; A ñ B, (read; A is not connected to
              B: 'A ñ B = Ø'.



  Dis-Union:   If A U B = C and C n A = A is true, then the
               Dis-Union of the Set A from the Set C,
               C BarU A = B, (read; C dis-union A) is the
               exclusion of the members from the Set C, which
               are common to the Sets C and A, iff, A ñ B = Ø.



                  2.  If A Not= C and C n A = B, then C U A = E ñ D.


                  3.  If every Set A is a Sub-Set of itself, and
                      A n A = A, then A U A = Ø.


  Exponential Cardinal: If for every X, where X E U, there is a
  condition, such that;

                 X n X = X,
                 X n X n X = X,
                 (Xv1 n Xv2 n Xv3 n ...  n XvQ) = X, and
                 X^Q = X is True.

                 Then there is a Exponential Number, Q, called
                 the Exponential Cardinal of X, which is the
                 number that represents the occurrences of X in
                 the equation representing its Intersection.


    Set:  If a Unit Whole contains a collection of Objects, and
          each Object defines, one and only one, Part belonging
          to the Unit Whole, then the Unit Whole defines a Set
          as a Collection of Objects, iff, each Object defines
          one and only one Element, or Member, that defines the
          Part belonging to the Unit Whole.

                           The Theorems


  Sub-Set:  If every element, E, of a Set B is a E of the Set A,
            then the Set A is said to contain every E of the Set
            B, and the Set B is said to be a Sub-Set of the Set
            A. Hence, every Set is a Sub-Set of itself, iff,
            A n A = A.


  Cardinal Number: If it may be concluded that the Multiplicative
                   Identity Law is True, and X x 1 = X, where X
                   does not change, then from Set Theory, X is the
                   Multiplicative Identity of Itself. And if this
                   defines X, when X = X^Q, then X defines the
                   Identity Element as the Unit Base, or the
                   Cardinal Number = 1 defines the Common
                   Coefficient as the Multiplicative Identity
                   Element for all X| X E U.

 Therefore, if {Uv1 n Uv2 n Uv3 n ...  n UvQ} = U^Q = U^Qv{N} = U,
 and given that Multiplication is the Quantified Sum of Addition,
 where X^Q = U^Qv{N} is True. Then for all X| X E U = U^Qv{N} = UvN,
 the Cardinality of any Set UvN, is the Sum or Union of Cardinal
 Numbers, or
 UvN  =  {Xv1 U Xv2 U ... U XvQ}  =  (1v1 + 1v2 + ... + 1vQ),
 iff, for all X| X E U, X = 1 defines the Cardinal Number for the
 Element of every Set as a Sub-Set of I | I = Set of Integers.

 In which case, the Unary Set, {1}, defines the Cardinal for the
 Element X of the Set I for all X| X E I, given that I = {X},
 when X = 1, and the Cardinal for every Element X of the Set I
 for all X| X E I, when
 I = {X, X, X ... X}, and X = 1, I = (1v1 + 1v2 + 1v3 +  ...  + 1vQ).


    Hence, the definition of a Cardinal Number is given by:


   Cardinal Number: The Cardinal Number is the Multiplicative
                    Identity Element for all X| X E I, which
                    represents the Element of the Unary Set
                    that is used to determine the Cardinality
                    of every Set from the Sum or Union of the
                    Multiplicative Identity Element for
                    every E X of the Set I: iff X^Q = X.

        Note: This defines the Unit Base X, for all X| X E I as the
              Element of the Unary Set, because X is the
              Multiplicative Identity of Itself that defines, X = 1.



     [The next proof presented, is the interpretation of the Proof,
      or implications, that Fermat never understood, or could not
      explain. This is the accepted rationalization because Set
      Theory, the complete Logical Model of Mathematics, was not
      finished for nearly 200 years later. However, because he
      Co-Discovered the Cartesian Coordinate System representing
      the Mathematics of Analytic Geometry. The mathematical
      relationships from the foregoing, he should have maintained
      an above average understanding of the foundational theory of
      the proof presented. Still, for me, these results initially
      implied the existence of: the 'Distributive Law for
      Exponential / Non-Linear Functions'; an alternate
      Mathematical Field that was Finite and Closed / True as
      defined by the Axiom for Equality, the Field Postulates,
      and Set Theory. In which, it was later discovered, actually
      defined the Binary Set and the {Binary Enumeration &
      Mathematics} Mathematics of the Binary System.
      e. Terrell 1983]


    Nevertheless, since the foregoing conclusions proves that
    because the 'Multiplicative Identity Element' defines the
    Universal 'Common Coefficient', which is the same for all
    Objects, as the element, 1, defined in the Unary Set. And
    since it may also be concluded that counting is actually
    the assignment of a '1' to every object to be counted, and
    then, adding the "1's" that represent the objects,
    determines the Cardinality of the Set containing the objects
    being counted. Clearly, if the Set I, the Set of Integers
    defines the Set of all Symbols used to represent the result
    of the addition, inclusion, or incremental progression using
    the element, 1, defined in the Unary Set (given by Table II),
    then the (Arabic Numerals / Positive Integers) Modern System
    of Counting is defined by the Unary Set: As a Unary System.

    In other words, since the Cardinal Number, by definition,
    must define the Neutral Multiplicative Identity Element that
    represents the Unit Base X of X^Q, then any change in the
    Count of the Number of Members contained in the Set X, must
    define the Union (or Sum) of the members belonging to the
    Disjoint Set representing the Set Xv[2 thru N], iff X = X^Q,
    the Cardinality of the Set equals the Sum of the Cardinal
    Numbers representing each of the its Members.




    In which case:




    If the Unit Base X of X^Q is defined ONLY when
    X = XvN = X^Q remains valid, and;



    I.   2 Members in a Binary Set =
           (A U B)^Q  =  Xv[2 =  (A U B)] = X^Q, or

          (A U B U C U D)^Q = Xv[4 = (A U B U C U D)] = X^Q, or


    IV.  N Members in a N-nary Set =
           (A U B U ... U NvN)^Q = Xv[N  =  (A U B U ... U N)] = X^Q,

         is TRUE,

       THEN:



    I.a     2 Members in a Binary Set  =
                         Xv[2 =  (A U B)] = X^2 = X^Q, or

       Must also be TRUE.





   In other words, the Proof for the existence of any Numbering
   System involving the Unit Base X of X^Q, would conclude the

    Nevertheless, these conclusions confirm the existence of the

    And reasoned further that if either 'a', or 'b' is equal to

    In other words, from the definition of the Cardinal Number,
    the Cardinality of the Unary and the Binary Sets represents a
    1 : 11 ratio, which denotes the number of Elements each Set
    contains. Nevertheless, the defining expression representing
    this relationship given by;


  'Unary Set = 1', 'Binary Set = 11', or  '1 = 2' - 'Prime Numbers'

        Note: A 'Prime Number' or 'Prime Integer', is a positive
              integer, 'p is Greater Than or Equal to 1', that has
              no positive integer divisors other than itself, 'p',
              and '1'.

   And if, from the Substitution Law for Equality; {0, 1} = {a, b},
   where '1 = {00}, and {00} is Not Equal to {Ø}', then the correct
   Binary System and its associated method for enumeration, given by
   Table IV, confirms '11111111 = 256 = 2^8, because
   2^8 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2  = 11111111 = 256'.
   Hence, the definition of the Cardinal Number, by figure 11,
   defines the special case of the Distributive Law as the
   intersection of the Distributive Properties defining the Binary
   and the Unary Sets, for all X | for every Element of I, the
   Cardinal Number X, defines the Cardinality of both Sets.

    It should be clearly understood that the forgoing conclusions,
    and the new definitions and theorems from the Logic of the
    Mathematics of Quantification, defines the closure Laws for
    the operations of Subtraction and Division. And this completes
    the Set of Laws defining the operations of Addition,
    Multiplication, Subtraction, and Division, which governs the
    Mathematics and the Mathematical Logic defined by Set Theory,
    the Field Postulates, and the Axioms for Equality. That is,

   2.3   The Binary and Ternary Systems and George Boole's
         Mathematical Logic


    It should readily be concluded, because it has been mentioned
    that the Boolean, or Leibniz, Operators are Unary; they are
    both logically valid for the Unary and the Binary Systems.
    Furthermore, since Zero, Ø, or the Null Set, is not defined
    by the Cardinal Number, which is equal to the Unit Base X of
    X^Q for all X| X is an Element of I, then Ø, is not an element
    of the Set of Integers, 'I'. Hence, Binary and Ternary Logic,
    or 3 State Logic is defined by the Unary Set, and contains the
    elements {Ø, +1} and {-1, Ø, +1}, which are governed by the
    Closure Laws. Given by Table VIII, we have;

    Note: It should be understood nevertheless, these conclusions
          confirms that the Binary System is Finite and Closed
          over 'R' (not true for all values of the Base Variables
          over 'R' - The Logic of Set Theory), and the Unary System
          is Infinite, and it is also Closed over 'R'.

           II. Using Extended ASCII CODE & Binary '00' = 1

     In the Extended ASCII CODE character Set, True Zero is
     defined as the Null Set Character, ' Ø '. However,
     because Binary equivalent of ' 1 ' is ' 00 ', I believe
     that it would be easier if the Character Set were changed
     to represent the Binary equivalent of ' 1 ' as ' 0 ', as
     opposed to '00', because '00' is 2 Bits and '0' is '1' Bit.

          III. Equating the Exponent from a Base 2 Exponential
                  Operation to the Binary Translation that
                             Equals the Result *

     More importantly, when rationalizing these conclusions, their
     validity becomes even more evident when any mathematical
     comparison between the 'Bit-Mapped' Lengths, or Displacement
     of an IP Address, is made with the Equation representing the
     Total Number of Available IP Addresses - the Address Pool
     representing the Addressing Specification; e.g. IPv4, or IPv6.  

     That is; If the Bit Length is Equal to 32, in the IPv4
     Specification, or 128 Bits in the IPv6 Specification,
     and their respective Address Pool Totals is given by:

       IPv4 = 32 Bit Length   (Bit-Mapped Displacement)
       32 Bit = 2^32   Address Pool Total
       2^32 = 4,294,967,296   IP Addresses

       IPv6 = 128 Bit Length   (Bit-Mapped Displacement)
       128 Bit = 2^128   Address Pool Total
       2^128 = 3.4028236692093846346337460743177e+38 IP Addresses

The Ternary Logical States of the Binary System        October 28, 2006




     Then it becomes quite obvious that the Total Number of IP
     Addresses available in the Address Pool for either the IPv4,
     or the IPv6 Specification, is a function of the Address's
     Bit-Mapped Displacement, or Bit Length. In other words, a Bit
     Length Regression to Progressively smaller Address Bit-Mapped
     Displacement Units, just as the foregoing conclusions revealed,
     accounts for the total number of available IP Addresses in the
     Address Pool - and this also determines, equals, and represents,
     the exact number of Bits equal to the Number representing the
     IP Address Pool Total. In other words, this Number or Integer,
     which equals the Result from an Exponential Base 2 Operation,
     has a Binary Translation that is equal to the value of the
     Exponent in the Equation.






  Hence, Enumerating, or Counting using only the Exponent reveals:



 1)  An 8 Bit-Mapped Length  = 2^8 = 256 IP Addresses = 256 = 11111111


 2)  A 7 Bit-Mapped Length   = 2^7 = 128 IP Addresses = 128 = 1111111


 3)  A 6 Bit-Mapped Length   = 2^6 = 64  IP Addresses = 64  = 111111


 4)  A 5 Bit-Mapped Length   = 2^5 = 32  IP Addresses = 32  = 11111


 5)  A 4 Bit-Mapped Length   = 2^4 = 16  IP Addresses = 16  = 1111


 6)  A 3 Bit-Mapped Length   = 2^3 = 8   IP Addresses = 8   = 111


 7)  A 2 Bit-Mapped Length   = 2^2 = 4   IP Addresses = 4   = 11


 8)  A 1 Bit-Mapped Length   = 2^1 = 2   IP Addresses = 2   = 01


 9)  A '0' Bit-Mapped Length = 2^0 = 1   IP Address   = 1   = 00

     So, how then is it possible for anyone to use an Askew
     Binary System of Counting, when the Exponent representing
     the Bit-Mapped Displacement in the Base 2 Exponential
     Equation, equals the Binary Translation representing the
     " Equation's " Result?

    IV.  Binary Zero { 00 } Representing an Irrational Number...??


    If every Base 2 Exponential Equation representing the Product
    of 2 or more Identical Multiplicands, defines the Result as a 
    Function of the Square Root of 2 when Binary '00' = 1. Then,
    from the "Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, and the Mathematics
    of Quantification; when "00"  =  1, "00" defines an Irrational
    Number, which is a Member of the "Real Number Set" - Where by;



           ' IF ' " 00 "  =  1 is True, then;


             X( 0 + 0 )   =  ( 0^2 + 0^2 )  =  1


                          =  (2^1/2)/2 [((2^1/2)/2) + (2^1/2)/2)]

                          =  (2^0.5)/2 [(2^0.5)/2) + (2^0.5)/2)]

                          =  (2^0.5)/2)^2  + (2^0.5)/2)^2

                  " 1 "   =  (0.707106)^2  + (0.707106)^2

                  " 1 "   =  0.5 + 0.5  =  X( 0 + 0 )



              Where, if " 1^0.5 " = " 1 ", and " F = 0 "; then
              " F = Variable Irrational Number ". Hence;



              (2^0.5)/2   =  0.70710678118654752440084436210485


                    0.5   = (0.70710678118654752440084436210485)^2


                  " 1 "   =  ( F^2  +  F^2 )  =  2^0  =  " 00 "

           V.  ‘Obsolescence’ of the 'HEX' System with the 'Base
                 2 Binary Exponential' System of Counting; 2EX


     Aides from (also) being an 'askew' system of counting, the
     inefficiency of the HEX System of counting becomes quite obvious
     when using the 'CIDR Network Descriptor', as outlined by the
     "Work(s) in Progress" [12]; 'The CIDR Network Descriptor expands
     the size of the IPtX Address Space beyond the IPv6 IP Addressing
     Specification". In other words, the ancillary discrepancy is that,
     it cannot be used in performing Mathematical Calculations, because
     it 'Can-Not' accurately represent the 'Exponent' (the Bit-Mapped
     Displacement), nor define the Numeral equaling the Bit-Mapped
     Length; 'Exponential System of Counting' [page 47]. That is, the
     HEX System of counting can only be used to depict (or represent)
     the Numeral prior to converting it to the equivalent Binary
     Representation.

     And more importantly, because the Binary Base 2 Exponential System
     can represent any Irrational Number(s), which includes Decimal
     Fractions, it can be used in All Mathematical Calculations. In
     other words, Binary Zero has a numerical value (as noted - See
     [IV.]), which is not defined by the conversion from the HEX
     System of Counting, rendering Bit-Mapped Displacement for a Binary
     Numeral. Hence, the Binary Base 2 Exponential System of Counting,
     is not only the suitable replacement for the HEX System, but it
     is the appropriate system, which should be used to represent
     [every 2 State System defined in Nature as representing the
     Binary Pair, {0,1}] the Binary operations defining the Computer.
     And this, more notably means it can Bit-Map exactly the Frequency
     of any Transmission Signal, and every Frequency defined by the
     Electromagnetic Spectrum.

    Note: Microsoft's Windows Calculator, and others, is wrong.


          - The Operating Systems and Software of Microsoft, Cisco,
            IBM, Wolfram, and others, who use the HEX System of
            Counting, are also wrong; there is No Conversion with
            the Base 2 Exponential Equations defining the Binary
            System.

          - And this includes every Electronic Device / Component

          - In other words, using the HEX System of Counting does
            not change anything, because it maps to the current
            Binary System- it is also an Askew System of Counting.
            In which case, any measurements derived from its use in
            any Calculation(s) will be Wrong... And if, the Trial
            and Error Tests cannot be performed, or fail, lives
            could be Lost as a direct result...

          - The Irony? Today’s Authority in Mathematics maintains;
            Isaac Newton was a great Mathematician who invented
            Calculus. The truth however, is that; 'There was never
            a Conflict of Plagiarism, between Newton and Leibniz,
            which involved the discovery of Calculus: A Ruse.
            Newton hated Leibniz, because Leibniz proved that the
            Mathematics involving Newton's Laws of Motion was
            wrong!' A fact, nearly a 100 years later, that was
            proven to be true by several noted mathematicians,
            which includes "Emilie de Breteuil du Chatelet".

            Even still, this marks only the beginning of Newton's
            failures, because not all of his Mathematical and
            Scientific Research could be interpreted by the
            Mathematicians and Physicists during this period. In
            other words, there are additional flaws, not only with
            his interpretation of Galileo’s Research, but, in the
            Logical Foundation of Calculus, the Mathematical System
            he is accredited for inventing.


            Consider, for example, Newton's Third Law of Motion,
            which states;



            "For Every Action there is an Equal and Opposite
             Reaction."



E Terrell                   Internet Draft                    [Page 53]

The Ternary Logical States of the Binary System        October 28, 2006



            The problem however, is that, this is a Law defining an
            'Action Reaction Event' that is not (as such) defined in
            Nature. That is, "Unless Acted on by an Additional Force"
            (i.e. "Acted Upon" by another Force), this represents an
            'Action Reaction Event' that does not occur normally in
            Nature (or anywhere in the Universe).



            Now consider the Opposing Argument:


            'When a Ball, a Rock, or Rain for that matter, falls in
            a Pool of Water - What happens? A Wave Front is formed,
            which travels in all directions, forming a Circle of
            Propagating Waves that diminishes in size, over time,
            until the Wave Front vanishes [fig c.]. So - For
            Newton to be correct, as given by fig a., a Ball
            rolling Down, then Up an Inclined Plane, must have
            Equal displacement(s) for both Planes, and Frames of
            Reference. In fact, it does not matter whether or not
            the Ball's Motion is on an Inclined Plane, dropped into
            a Pool of Water, or it is being Bounced, as a Child's
            play toy, because the Principles of Physics are still
            the same'.

            In other words, from the Logic of the 'Mathematics of
            Quantification', "Equal and Opposite" means Balance, or
            Equilibrium; i.e. 'No ability to Change', or 'Continuous
            without Change'. And for this to exist in Nature -
            Well... to put it in another way; 'No Life can exist'.
            And clearly, if there were no difference, the comparison
            of 'fig a.' and 'fig b.', then the Ball's Motion on the
            Incline Plane would continue indefinitely, and never
            stop; 'The Perpetual Motion Machine'.

            In any case, while 'Vector Mathematics' concludes that
            the Measurements for the 'A' and 'B' [fig a.] Planes
            are Equal; it does not mean Newton was correct. In other
            words, however small of a difference, the interacting
            Forces involved in the Mathematical Relationship define
            an 'Action Reaction Event', which measures the Interaction
            between the Forces that defines the Dimensional
            Measurements of the resulting Frame of Reference (Today,
            it would be called; 'The Magnitude and Directional
            Difference between Vector Quantities'). In which case, if
            Newton were correct, then the Height of a bouncing Ball
            would never change; it would be a Constant, and the Ball
            would never stop bouncing [Normative References
            [Physics 1.].

            In other words, the resulting Forces defining the 'Action
            Reaction Event', or the Interaction between 2 or more
            Vector Quantities, must clearly define at least 3 Forces;
            i.e. the Objects are 3-D, and not a 2-D Paper Drawing –
            Consider for example, the 3 Dimensional Perpendicular
            Relationship between Electricity and Magnetism; where the
            Magnetic Force defines a Common Phenomenon resulting from
            the 'Action Reaction Event' involving the creation or
            occurrence of Electricity. That is, Magnetism defines a
            unique Electromagnetic Frequency having a Perpendicular
            flow direction that Propagates simultaneously only with an
            Electric Current. However, this accompanying Perpendicular
            Frequency, it should also be noted, is a Common
            (Non-Magnetic) Attribute having a Frequency of Vibration
            that defines the Phenomenon resulting from an 'Action
            Reaction Event', which is Uniquely associated with every
            Frequency defined by the Electromagnetic Spectrum.

      Note: There are 2 distinct measurements for the Velocity,
            which are related to it's Mass;

            1) 'Mass Displacement Unit'

               - defines the Velocity of an Object as a
                 Function of the Force associated with the
                 Mass of a Moving Object

               - Defines the Force resulting from the Motion 
                 of a Mass


            2) 'Mass Dimensional Displacement Unit'

               - defines the Distance Traveled by the Velocity of an
                 Object, as a Function of the Dimensional Measurements
                 Displaced by the Mass of the Moving Object

               - Defines the Distance resulting from the Motion of the
                 Mass's Dimensions

               - i.e. the Mass's Dimensions or Shape, could be a
                 Square, Circle, Triangle, or have any Geometric Shape

                 a) How does the Object Move, Slide, Tumble, Rotate, or
                    some combined Motion?

                    1) Object Slides  - Mass length
                    2) Object Tumbles - Distance between Diameters
                    3) Object Rotates - Diameter of Rotation

                 b) What is the Difference in the Distance, when the
                    Velocity measures a Point Object, or a Circular
                    Object with a Unit Diameter?

                    1) Distance Measurement must be Equal for both
                       Objects 
                    2) The accuracy of a Dimensional Displacement
                       measurement questions the relationship between
                       'Distance and Time'; i.e. the validity of 'The
                       Law of Falling Bodies', because the measurement
                       of a 'Unit of Distance' is a Function of the
                       Object's Geometry, and for almost every Object,
                       it represents a different value.
                    3) This difference represents a change in the
                       definition for the 'Unit of Distance'; i.e. the
                       ‘Obsolescence’ of the measurement for the 'Unit
                       of Distance' with the measurement expressing
                       the 'Mass Dimensional Displacement Unit'.

            Proof: Defining the Problem -


            Let the Ball's Mass, and the Force of Gravity, define the
            Ball's Accelerated Motion: first Down, then Up an Inclined
            Plane. And then let, the 'Action Reaction Event' define the
            'Rest Mass' of the Ball as the measurement defining the
            Ball's 'Rest Mass Displacement Unit'. The measure of the
            Dimensional Displacement that the Ball's Mass measures

       Given that;


       1) the optimum 'Angle of Separation' of 60 degrees, defines the
          balance of the Forces acting upon the Ball's 'Up and Down
          Motion' on the Incline Plane maintains a Result, when all
          Variables and Parameters are Equal, which is Equal to the
          Result of the Equation defining a Linear 'Action Reaction
          Event'; i.e. when the given 'Angle of Separation' is Equal
          to 180 degrees. ('As in a Game of Billiards, when the 'Cue
          Ball' is used to HIT another Ball into a Pocket) [fig f.].'

       2) the value of the 'Unit Time', which used to determine the
          Ball's 'Rest Mass' Velocity [the Ball's 'Rest Mass Velocity'
          measures the Distance the Ball's Mass Traveled, 'Rest Mass
          Displacement', in a Unit of Time] is equal to '1'.

       3) the Amount of Resistance, which defines the Opposing Force
          measuring the Ball's Resistance to Motion, is equal to the
          Force defining the Ball's 'Rest Mass Velocity'; where the
          'Rest Mass Displacement' Position is denoted by (z). And
          it should also be noted, the conclusions derived from this
          argument applies to the 2 Dimensional Perspective measuring
          the displacement made by the Ball's Mass in the UP and Down
          Motion on the Incline Plane. Noting more specifically, that
          the Ball is Not a 'Point-Mass', its Shape, the measurement
          of the 'Rest Mass Displacement Unit' has the Dimensions,
          which resolve its Geometry; given that a 3 Dimensional 'Rest
          Mass Displacement' equals the Ball's (3-D Mass) 'Density
          Displacement', or the Force defined by the Motion of a Mass.

             where, the Ball's 'Rest Mass Displacement' = MD

             MD = Mass Distance = the Ball's Mass = M

             and M/1 = MD/1 = M/t = MD/t = Mass

             where t = Unit of Time = 1


       Thus, from the foregoing;


       4) if the Ball's Rest Mass Position represents its Potential
          Energy, then the Ball's Rest Mass Position defines its
          Kinetic Energy as the Resistance Force measuring the
          distance that the Ball's Mass Displacement Unit Travels in
          a Unit of Time. And this defines the Minimum amount of Force
          required to move the Mass of the Ball the equivalent
          distance, which is equal to the Dimensional Displacement
          defining the Distance Traveled by its Mass, or 'One Mass
          Displacement Unit'.


       5) if the Ball's Rest Mass Position defines 'Potential Energy'
          as 'Static Equilibrium', then 'Dynamic Equilibrium' defines
          'Kinetic Energy'.


       6) if the optimum 'Angle of Separation' of 60 degrees, defines
          the balance of the Forces acting upon the Ball's 'Down and
          Upward Motion' on the Incline Plane, maintains a Result that
          is also Equal to the Result of the Equation defining the
          Vector Quantities involved in a Linear 'Action Reaction
          Event' (when the given 'Angle of Separation' is Equal
          to 180 degrees); then the 'Resistance Force' defined by the
          Ball's 'Rest Mass Displacement Unit' is a Constant; because
          the 'Angle of Separation' does not change the relationship
          between the Masses of the interacting Objects.


       And given the conclusions from the 'Mathematics of
       Quantification' and the proof of 'Fermat's Last Theorem',
       which provides for the condition of Equality to exist between
       the Results from the 2 equations defining the effects from the
       Force of Gravity on a Ball traveling on a Straight Horizontal
       Line Path, and a Sloped Path of a Non-Horizontal Line, as equal.
       [- true as well for the Linear and the Non-Linear Lines, and
       the Binary and Unary Sets.] Then, if the Slope of the Line
       through any Point along the Downward Incline of the Ball's Path,
       before the Return, or Upward Path of the Ball Motion equals

       Zero, then the Ball's Upward Velocity is Less than its Downward
       Velocity on the Incline Plane. And the 'Zero Position', (c) in
       'fig e.', defines a 'Force of Resistance', which is equal to the
       position' (c) of 'fig f.', that defines the Ball's 'Rest Mass',

       given by 'fig g.', where the relationship between the Line(s)
       is given by;

            Now - let;


            the 'Cue Ball' at (a), have a 'Rest Mass' equal to the
            'Rest Mass' of the 'Billiard Ball' at (c) - which is

            Clearly, since the Forces and Displacement of the Balls
            are Equal before an identical Mass Equivalent Force of
            Resistance causes a Velocity Reduction, or a Decrease in
            Acceleration of both Balls, at the Position (c), then;

            (a) - (c) = (x1)   and    G(MD(a))/t - MD(c)/t

            (b) - (c) = (k)    and    G(MD(b))/t - MD(c)/t

            (k) = (k');  where k' - [Read; the Compliment of k: k']

            Hence;  if (a) = (b),

            and; (k) = (e');  where (e') equals the Final Position of
                              the Ball Rolling Up an Incline Plane]

            when; ' (c) = MD/t = MD/1 = MD = M = Mass '

            then; (k)^2 + (c)^2 = (a)^2; or X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2

            and; (k) = (e') = (x1)

            Therefore, figure b [fig b.] is the correct depiction,
            and Newton's Third Law should have been written as;

            If "For every Action there is a Reaction, then the
            Interaction between these Forces defines an 'Action
            Reaction Event', which is a Natural occurrence in Nature".


    - Or - more appropriately as;


            "For every Force of Action there is an Equal Force of
             Reaction, 'If and only If', the 'Quantified Sum of the
             Reaction Forces' is equal to the 'Force of Action',
             which initiates the 'Action Reaction Event'".


       In other words, Newton's Third Law of Motion defines the 'Action
       Reaction Event' only involving 'Equal and Opposite' Forces -
       representing the equation(s) given by;

             X = Y, or X - Y = 0

       And this is clearly wrong, because there are at least 3 Forces
       defined by every 'Action Reaction Event';

             1) Force of Action - (a)

             2) Force of Resistance - (c)

             3) Force of Reaction - (k)

       Hence, from the Mathematics of Quantification, the equations for
       the 'Action Reaction Event' is defined by;

             X + Y = Z, or X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2; where (a)^2 = Z^2, and

             a)^2 - (c)^2 = (k)^2

            Furthermore, the Foundations of the Calculus, which
            Newton is accredited for inventing, becomes questionable
            with the introduction of an Alternate Mathematical Field.
            Especially since, the New Field represents the development
            of a New System of Counting, or more specifically, a
            different (definition) way of representing a Number.

            In other words, the point to be made in this case, is
            that; the 'Derivative of a Constant' 'Is Not Equal to
            Zero'. Especially since, if the 'Constant' is unknown,
            then it's Derivative, using the New representation for
            a Numeral [page 47], is given by (the 'Power Rule');



            2EX  =  C ;

            where C = Constant,

            and 2EX defines any Numeral in Real Number Set

            So.. - What's the Derivative of '2EX'?

            Using the 'Power Rule', Let 2 = N, and 2EX = 2^X, then;



                             d
                             -- (NEX) = XNE(X - 1) = XN^X - 1

                             d
                             -- (2EX) = 2XE(X - 1)
                             dx



            Given that;


            XN^X - 1  =  2XE(X -1 )  =  2XEX - 1  =  2X^X - 1

            because they do not have a University Affiliation.



            It does not matter who believes 'what', because;


            1) 'Time-Travel' is an impossibility, which would
                violate the Conservation Laws. In other words,
