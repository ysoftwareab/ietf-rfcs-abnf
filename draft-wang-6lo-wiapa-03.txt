Internet-Draft            IPv6 over WIA-PA              September 2015


1. Introduction

   It has been well known that Wireless Networks for Industrial
   Automation-Process Automation (WIA-PA) standard became the national
   standard of China, as well as the international standard approved by
   the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 2011. WIA-PA
   is an industrial wireless network standard towards industrial
   process automation, which consists of host, gateway, routing, field
   devices and handheld devices. WIA-PA networks have been widely used
   in factories, mines, smart home, intelligent transportation and all
   scenes related to the Internet of Things. Internet Protocol Version
   6 (IPv6) is designed by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with
   the advantage of high security, good mobility, address auto-
   configuration and abundant address resources. Recently, there has
   been a considerable interest in the transmission of IPv6 packets in
   industrial wireless sensor networks. For the research on the IPv6
   key technologies and standards, IETF sets up the corresponding
   working groups. For instance, 6lo working group, which is devoted to
   applying IPv6 technology to resource-limited networks, and IPv6-
   based Low-power Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) protocol has been
   the main standard of IPv6 application for wireless sensor networks.

   There exists a trend to apply IP technology to field devices for
   industrial applications, without a doubt, it also meets the demand
   of market. In 2013, ZigBee Alliance published the ZigBee IP
   specification, which makes a great contribution to connecting
   wireless sensor networks to Internet seamlessly via IPv6 technology.
   The network layer of ISA100.11a standard published by Industry
   Subversive Alliance (ISA) International Society of Automation has
   been fully compatible with 6LowPAN technology. In addition, Highway
   Addressable Remote Transducer (HART) fund published Wireless HART
   standard, and introduced the latest HART function HART-IP in Hanover
   Industrial Fair in 2014. Nevertheless, in China, none of the key
   technology of WIA-PA standard is related to IPv6, and it is rare to
   discuss IPv6 for WIA-PA networks abroad. It is important to realize
   that through IPv6 technology, we can achieve the interconnection
   between WIA-PA networks and Internet. For the Internet, a variety of
   technologies and mature applications can be extended to WIA-PA
   networks directly, and for WIA-PA networks, we can extend the range
   of transmission among industrial devices to all over the world.

   [RFC4944] has defined the transmission of IPv6 packets on IEEE
   802.15.4. The WIA-PA standard based on IEEE 802.15.4 has been used
   extensively in industrial process measurement, monitoring and
   surveillance. In [RFC4944], IPv6 technology can be applied to
   support the transmission of IPv6 packets over WIA-PA networks.

2.1. WIA-PA Network Topology

   WIA-PA network topology SHOULD have two layers and it is a
   combination of star topology and mesh topology. The first layer is a
   MESH network, which is made up of gateways and routing nodes and can
   enhance robustness of WIA-PA networks. Moreover, WIA-PA networks
   also define redundancy gateways and redundancy routings, which
   enhances the reliability and self-healing capacity of the network.
   The second layer is a star network, which consists of routing nodes
   and field devices, and it is easy for network maintenance and
   management due to the relatively simple topology. And the WIA-PA
   network topology is shown in Figure 1.

2.2. WIA-PA Protocol Architecture

   WIA-PA network protocol follows OSI reference model, however, it
   only defines data link layer, network layer and application layer,
   physical layer and MAC layer are based on IEEE 802.15.4. And The
   WIA-PA network protocol stack is shown here:

2.3. Address Types of WIA-PA Networks

   As for address types, in WIA-PA networks, all devices MUST have
   globally unique EUI-64 long addresses and 16-bit short addresses.
   Devices are assigned EUI-64 long addresses by manufacturers and 16-
   bit short addresses by host, and they communicate for one another
   with a short address.

3. Specification of IPv6 over WIA-PA Networks

   In this section, we define the specification of IPv6 packets over
   WIA-PA networks.

   WIA-PA standard has defined MESH router mechanism,
   aggregation/disaggregation and fragmentation/restructuring, thus for
   WIA-PA networks with IPv6 technology, we SHOULD NOT adopt the MESH
   router mechanism and the fragmentation/restructuring defined by
   6LoWPAN. However, in [RFC4944] and [RFC6282], address compression
   and stateless address auto-configuration SHOULD be applied to WIA-PA
   networks.

3.1. Protocol Stack

   The IPv6 over WIA-PA protocol stack is shown in Figure 3. The
   protocol stack contains application layer, transport layer, network
   layer, data link layer and physical layer, and the functions of each
   layer are as follows:

o Application layer: It defines the communication service to support
   the communications among a plurality of objects of distributed
   applications in industrial environment. For data communication
   service, it mainly includes three types of modes: client/server
   communication, publish/subscribe communication and report
   communication.

o Transport layer: It uses the connectionless and small footprint UDP
   protocol, and provides the service between network layer and
   application layer. Meanwhile, it also completes the encapsulation and
   parsing of UDP packets and the establishment and destruction of UDP
   connection.

o Network layer: It is divided into network layer upper and network
   layer lower, wherein the network layer upper is the Internet layer
   which consists of IP layer and adaptation layer. The main tasks of IP
   layer are IPv6 packets encapsulation, address resolution, and
   providing mobility support and stateless address auto-configuration,
   etc. IPv6 header compression mechanism and padding message values are

   executed in adaptation layer. Network layer lower is WIA-PA network
   layer, which is mainly used for the network layer of WIA-PA standard.
   In addition, MESH subnet routing and addressing are also achieved in
   Network layer lower.

o Data link layer and physical layer: Both of them adopt the techniques
   of WIA-PA standard. Data link layer supports radio frequency (RF)
   channel access, and device network joining, etc. Physical layer is
   used for energy detection, channel selection, as well as starting and
   ending a RF transceiver.

3.2. Network Layer Frame Format

   In order to introduce IPv6 technology to WIA-PA networks, we combine
   WIA-PA standard and IPv6 technology, adding Internet layer and
   transport layer to previous WIA-PA network protocol stack, where
   adaptation layer and IP layer MUST be included in Internet layer.

3.2.1. Network Layer Frame Format

   The WIA-PA network frame format with IPv6 technology is shown in
   Figure 4. If the command frames interact with each other, the frame
   format SHOULD NOT include Internet layer, transport layer and
   application layer, and if the IPv6 packets interact for one another,
   the frame format for IPv6 packets is as follows:

   The IPv6 packets make a modification on the frame control field of
   WIA-PA network layer header, which mainly defines bit5 of the frame
   control field. When bit5 is equal to 0, it indicates the packet MUST
   be a protocol data unit of WIA-PA network layer, and when bit5 is
   equal to 1, if package type is a WIA-PA network layer command frame,
   it indicates the packet MUST be an IPv6 related command frame, and
   if package type is a WIA-PA network layer packet, it indicates the
   packet MUST be an IPv6 packet then passes it to the upper layer to
   resolve. The revised WIA-PA network layer frame control field is
   shown in Figure 5.

3.2.2. Network Layer Command Frame

   In order to solve the problem of nodes getting the network prefix or
   IPv6 address, our document defines the following five categories of
   IPv6 network layer command frame:

1)        Enhanced IPv6 joining response command frame: The command identifier
   is defined as ''129'', and it SHOULD be used for IPv6 nodes to reply
   the access network request. Network layer frame format of the
   response is shown in Figure 6. According to the ways to distribute
   IPv6 addresses or prefixes by host, the values of response command
   frame related field to be different.

3.2.3. Transmission Format of IPv6 Packets

   For the transmission of IPv6 packets, our document combines 6LoWPAN
   address compression method and the ways to obtain IPv6 address to
   define the following four kinds of header format of Internet layer,
   and the format of Internet layer header is shown here:

    +-----------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------+

                Figure 11: Internet Layer Header Format

   The Internet layer headers of IPv6 packets have different dispatch
   due to the devices use different ways to get IPv6 address. And the
   four different types of dispatch mentioned above are as follows:

1)        If the devices communicate with extranet devices, we SHOULD use
   uncompressed IPv6 packets during transmission, then the Internet
   layer header contains dispatch and other fields, where the dispatch
   is ''01000001'' and other fields are the related fields of IPv6 header.

2)        If the IPv6 address prefix of devices is the entire network unified
   prefix, the IPv6 packets are stateless compression. In this case, the
   Internet layer header only contains dispatch and address compression
   coding with the value of ''011TT1HH00110011'', where the value of ''TT''
   represents IPv6 header compression about Traffic Class, and the value
   of ''HH'' represents IPv6 header compression about Hop Limit.

3)        If is not the entire network unified prefix, the IPv6 packets are
   state compression, and the Internet layer header also includes
   dispatch and the address compression coding with the value of
   ''0111111001110111''.

4)        If the devices use the IPv6 header compression algorithm of 6LoWPAN
   to partially compress IPv6 header, the Internet layer header contains
   dispatch, address compression coding and other fields, where other
   fields are the uncompressed part of IPv6 header.

3.3. Stateless Address Auto-Configuration Scheme

   All devices SHOULD be distributed prefixes or IPv6 addresses by host,
   and the process modes of devices are different due to the various
   distribution ways. There are three approaches as follows:

1)        Unified network prefix: Host distributes a unified whole network
   prefix to each device, and the devices can generate IPv6 addresses
   with address configuration method. Then, we have the following four
   categories of IPv6 address:

o The automatically generated IPv6 link-local address in the process of
   device initialization: The IPv6 link-local address SHOULD be composed
   by prefix and interface identifier, where the prefix is ''FE80::0'',
   and the interface identifier is the negation of bit7 of EUI-64
   physical address. The EUI-64 link-local address is shown here:

   interface identifier, only difference in composition, no more
   reiteration here. The short address link-local address is shown here:

o The IPv6 unicast address generated by the unified whole network

   a unified whole network prefix distributed by host, the interface
   identifier is the negation of bit7 of EUI-64 physical address, and
   the EUI-64 unicast address is shown in Figure 14, where N is the

2)        Non-Unified network prefix: Host distributes the entire network non-
   uniform prefix to devices, through the prefix, devices can generate
   IPv6 address with address configuration method. Consequently, it can
   also generate four kinds of IPv6 address, and the way is consistent
   with the unified one.

3)        IPv6 address: Host distributes IPv6 address to devices. Then, two
   kinds of IPv6 address can be generated, one is the IPv6 address
   distributed by host, the other is the IPv6 link-local address
   generated by EUI-64 physical address, as shown in figure 12.

3.4. Multicast Address Conversion Method

   In WIA-PA networks, there MUST be two types of address: EUI-64 long
   address and 16-bit short address. In order to achieve the conversion
   between WIA-PA network address and IPv6 network address, for EUI-64
   long address, we complete the conversion with the use of address
   configuration method in [RFC4944]. And the short address is divided
   into broadcast address and unicast address, the unicast address uses
   the address configuration method in [RFC4944], the definition of
   broadcast address is according to the broadcast address set by WIA-
   PA standard and the structural properties of IPv6 multicast address.
   Several types of WIA-PA broadcast address are shown here:

   +-------------+---------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
   |  Broadcast  |  Broadcast Address  |The Whole Network|  MESH Network   |     Gateway     |
   |Address Types|  within the Cluster |Broadcast Address|Broadcast Address|Broadcast Address|

   The IPv6 multicast address is shown in Figure 17. In [RFC4291], IPv6
   multicast address defines its top eight is ''11111111''. Besides, the
   second field is a flag field, it is permanent when the multicast
   address is ''0000'', and it is temporary when ''0001''. The third field
   is a range field, the different values represent the different range.
   The broadcast address of our document is only for devices in link-
   local, and the range field indicates link-local when it is ''0010''.

   networks, where the broadcast address within the cluster is
   ''FF12::x .FF''. Due to the broadcast address within the cluster is
   non-permanent distribution, thus its flag field is ''1'', and ''x''
   indicates the cluster address of network, which is located in ''1-
   254''. In addition, the broadcast address of entire network is
   ''FF02::1'', which represents all field devices from broadcast to
   network. The broadcast address of MESH network is ''FF02::2'', which
   represents all routers from broadcast to network, and the broadcast
   address of gateway is ''FF02::FF''.

   +----------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
   |    Broadcast   |Broadcast Address |The Whole Network|  MESH Network   |     Gateway     |
   |  Address Types |within the Cluster|Broadcast Address|Broadcast Address|Broadcast Address|
   +----------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
   | WIA-PA Network |   FF12::x. FF    |     FF02::1     |     FF02::2     |      FF02::FF   |
   | IPv6 Broadcast |  x Range: 1-254  |                 |                 |                 |

4. IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations related to this document.

5. Security Considerations

   In industrial environment, the wireless networks share the same
   place and time. In this case, if the security mechanism is not very
   brilliant, it will seriously affect the system's information
   security. The security mechanism is beyond the scope of this draft.

6. Conclusions

   This document proposed a scheme which is suitable for the
   transmission of IPv6 packets over WIA-PA networks. Protocol
   architecture, IPv6 specific command frame, the transmission format
   of packets in adaptation layer and multicast address conversion
   method are all defined in this document.
