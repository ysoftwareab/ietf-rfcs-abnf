   Abstract 
    
   This document discusses how a tail-end PE can signal the Quality of 
   Service parameters of the local Attachment Circuit to the head-end 
   PE for appropriate Pseudowire generation from head to tail end PE.

   The Pseudowires traditionally provide connectivity between two 
   Attachment Circuits that are on the edges of a service provider’s 
   network. A service provider assigns specific QOS parameters (i.e. 
   via manual configuration or dynamic signaling) to these Attachment 
   Circuits based on the service sold to the customer. In order to 
   interconnect and maintain the same level of service parameters 
   across the service provider network, it is prudent that the Provider 
   Edge devices that are endpoints of the Pseudowires, select or create 
   a suitable transport path that meets the Pseudowire’s quality of 
   service requirements. It is also possible that a PE may use 
   appropriate policing for traffic entering Pseudowire that match 
   remote Attachment Circuit’s capabilities as well as perform an 
   admission control check to ensure that the PE can indeed support the 
   desired QOS. 
    
   In order to accomplish an integrated service delivery it becomes 
   necessary that each PE understand the QOS requirements of the remote 
   Attachment Circuit. 
    
   This draft proposes an extension to the PWE3 control signaling to 
   enable a PE to exchange QOS parameters of the local Attachment 
   Circuit at the time of the PW establishment. 
    
   With advent of recent interest in multi-segmented Pseudowire 
   signaling the Pseudowire specific QOS requirements through multiple 
   PSN domains has become an important step in procuring the right 
   resources through intermediate PEs that perform Pseudowire 
   stitching. 
    
   In this revision we have added some more parameters that address 
   some of the requirements placed by Multi-hop Pseudowire Signaling. 
    
    
   1.0 Specification of Requirements 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 
    
    
   2.0 Introduction 
    
   The [PWE3-CONTROL] draft describes how two PEs signal PW-FEC to each 
   other in order to establish a pseudowire. The PW-FEC is exchanged 
   over the targeted LDP session and contains Pseudowire signaling 
   information that includes interface parameters of the local 
   Attachment Circuit.  
    
   Recently, [MH-PWE3] has introduced the concept of pseudowire 
   switching to interconnect data flows between multiple networks (or 
   domains). In pseudowire switching, one or multiple transit pseudo-
   wires nodes are involved in pseudo-wire setup and subsequent data 
   forwarding.

   For both single-hop as well as multi-hop pseudowires, exchanging 
   Attachment Circuit QoS information can be very important for 
   carriers. 
 
   For example, as shown in Figure-1, both CE1 and CE3 communicate with 
   CE2. A single-hop pseudowire, PW12, is established between PE1 and 
   PE2 to transfer traffic between CE1 and CE2. Similarly, PW32 is to 
   carry traffic between CE3 and CE2.

           Figure-1: Over-subscription problem in PWE3 
    
    
   For carriers to offer or guarantee any service beyond best-effort 
   between two CE's, the access links between CE and PE have to have 
   enough network resources to accommodate the sum of all pseudo-wire 
   traffic going to a specific CE.  In the example, the link between 
   PE2 and CE2 must be able to support the traffic from both PW12 and 
   PW32. 
    
   However, there is no mechanism available today to convey pseudo-wire 
   resource usage information between PE's. In today’s deployment, the 
   carriers have been using manual configuration to overcome the over-
   subscription problem. Lack of automation will likely introduce setup 
   errors and diagnostics problems as the number of pseudo-wires begin 
   to increase.

                 Figure 2: PW switching Reference Model 
    
   If manual configuring QoS information is tedious in single-hop 
   pseudo-wire, multi-hop pseudo-wire can make the job worse. Figure-2 
   is its reference model.  
    
   A multi-hop pseudo-wire consists of multiple segments. When a 
   particular pseudo-wire requires QoS guarantees, the actual QoS 
   enforcement needs to be carried out at each segment. Subsequently, 
   each PW switching point needs to be aware of the QoS parameters of 
   the AC. 
    
   This draft describes a mechanism whereby additional information, 
   such as QOS parameters of the local Attachment Circuit can be 
   dispatched with the VC-FEC in a backward compatible fashion. 
    
   This document specifies QOS TLV that can be included in the initial 
   Label Mapping Message and subsequently in LDP notification message 
   for conveying up-to-date information about the Pseudowire.  
    
   This proposal is orthogonal to the type of PW-FEC used. Both PWid 
   FEC (value 128) and Generalized ID FEC (value 129) can make use of 
   the new additions. In the case of PWid FEC the signaled QOS 
   information can be related to the GROUP_ID value when this field is 
   used in signaling. The term VC-FEC and PW-FEC is used 
   interchangeably in this document and refers to both the FEC Ids. 
    
   It is expected that capability of exchanging QOS information 
   dynamically would facilitate various applications to optimize the 
   use of core resources effectively. For example, a PE may use this 
   signaling for backpressure when ‘forward congestion’ is detected on 
   its local AC.

   3.0 Capability Learning for QOS exchange 
    
   For the purpose of learning remote end capabilities and for the 
   purpose of signaling to the remote end the local capabilities, this 
   draft suggests that the QOS TLV be included initially in the Label 
   Mapping message and particularly in the Optional Parameter field of 
   Label Mapping Message. When subsequent updates are required (after 
   the PW is established), the sender PE will use the LDP notification 
   message to convey an update of the new information. 
    
   Note that the mechanism described in this draft allows a given PE 
   that does not support the QOS TLV to be able to establish a 
   Pseudowire using normal operations. Indeed, the PEs that are 
   upgraded with such new functionality, examine the optional 
   parameters and note QOS TLV to learn the capability of the sending 
   peer. The sender must include the QOS TLV that it intends to use 
   later as an update, in the Label Mapping message that is used to 
   setup the FIB. Typically, such Label Mapping message is either the 
   first Label Mapping message or the one right after the Label 
   Withdraw/Release message and is referred to in this document as a 
   “Learning Label Mapping” message.  
    
   The absence of a given TLV in the Learning Label Mapping message 
   indicates to the receiver that the sending PE is either not capable 
   of processing such TLV or does not wish to engage in dynamic update 
   exchange for that TLV. The absence of QOS TLV indicates to the 
   receiving PE that normal PW signaling procedures should be used to 
   establish the PW (i.e., no inclusion of the optional TLVs in the 
   reverse label mapping). Similarly, the receiving PE that has not 
   been upgraded with the new TLVs and receives a label mapping with 
   the new TLVs will just ignore these TLVs during label mapping 
   processing phase.  
    
   The capability learning aspect of the PW QOS is only applicable for 
   the use of QOS TLV for dynamic update notifications. It does not 
   change the need to send the initial QOS TLV, irrespective of whether 
   remote PE is capable of processing the optional TLV or not. 
    
   It is also possible that the receiving PE is capable of processing 
   QOS TLV and uses unacceptable QOS requirement as a criterion to 
   release the VC-FEC. In such event, a status TLV is defined to be 
   included in the optional parameter field of the label release 
   message that informs the remote PE about the reasons for the 
   rejection. 
    
    
   4.0 Pseudowire QOS TLV 
    
   The pseudowire QOS TLV is used to notify the remote PE about Quality 
   of Service requirements of the local Attachment Circuit. 
    
   As stated earlier, this information can also be passed as an update. 
   It is possible that receiver may either adjust QOS parameters of the

   existing tunnel or may respond to the update by first withdrawing 
   the advertised PW label and re-advertise new PW label with same VC-
   FEC. 
    
   It is possible to send more than one QOS TLVs. The Flag field in the 
   QOS TLV provides the context for each TLV.

     Each TE parameter is encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single precision 
     floating-point number. The CIR and PIR are in units of bytes per 
     second while CBS and PBS are in units of bytes. 
    
   Flags 
     This field contains set of flag. There are two flags bits are 
     defined currently. They are, 
      
     D – Direction flag. The value zero in Direction Flag means Forward 
     direction. The forward direction typically represents the 
     direction from the advertiser to the receiver. The value 1 in 
     Direction flag means Reverse direction. The reverse direction 
     typically represents the return path to the advertiser. 
      
     R – Request/Available flag. The value zero in Request/Available 
     flag means Requested QOS by the advertiser. The value one means 
     what is available. In multi-segment PW signaling intermediate PEs 
     can adjust the available QOS when propagating the signal towards 
     the destination PE. 
      
     The rest of the bits in the Flag field are reserved. They should 
     be set to zero on send and ignored on receive. 
      
      
   Number of Sub-TLVs

     This field identifies the number of Sub-TLVs that follow. In 
     absence of any Sub-TLVs, this field should be set to zero. This 
     field is mandatory. 
      
   Sub-TLVs (1-n) 
     The n number of Type-Length-Value fields where ‘n’ is equal to 
     ‘Number of Sub-TLVs’ field. The presence of field facilitates 
     future/proprietary extensions 
     
    
   5.0 New LDP Status Codes 
    
   We define two types of status code.  
    
   One is to signal a fatal error. For example, a PE or a switching 
   node may reject pseudo-wire setup requests if QoS criteria cannot be 
   met. To reject a request, he node will include the error conditions 
   in the Status TLV that is a part of Label Release messages. 
    
   Another type of status provides advisory information. Contrary to 
   the previous case, a node may decide to setup the pseudo-wires even 
   though it cannot or don’t care to comply with the required QoS 
   parameters. Here, the node will send a Notification message to the 
   sender that includes the appropriated information in a Status TLV. 
    
   In case of multi-hop pseudo-wires, it is also possible that a 
   pseudo-wire may traverse several PSN’s. When setting up pseudo-wires 
   over GRE tunnels, it is very likely that the underlying traffic 
   conditioning mechanism is IP DiffServ, which does not guarantee per-
   flow bandwidth or burst. In this case, the pseudo-wire switching 
   nodes need to notify such mis-matching behavior toward the sender. 
    
    
      The format of the PW Status TLV is: 
       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Where the status code is a 4 octet bit field is specified in the PW 
   IANA Allocations document [13]. 
    
   According to Section 4.4 in [LDP], we can define new status codes 
   in the range of 0x20000000-0x3effffff. Here are the new status 
   codes: 
    
        - 0x20000003 "TC is OK" 
        - 0x20000004 "Cannot accept the TC parameters" 
        - 0x20000005 "Preempted due to TC processing"

   6.0 General Procedures 
    
   The PW QOS TLV is included in the Optional Parameter Field of the 
   Label Mapping Message and the LDP Notification Message. In case of 
   Label Mapping Message, Optional Parameter Field follows the Label 
   TLV object. In LDP Notification Message, Optional Parameter Field 
   must include PW-FEC TLV before QOS-TLV. As described above, exchange 
   of QOS TLV in Notification Message is determined by the capability 
   learning during the initial Label Mapping exchange. 
    
   The PW QOS TLV conveys Quality of Service parameters that 
   advertising PE would like remote PE to consider when 
   selecting/creating  appropriate transport tunnel to carry the 
   Pseudowire from remote PE to the advertising PE. The Quality of 
   Service parameters can also be used by the receiving PE to select 
   appropriate policer for his Attached Circuit or perform an admission 
   control check.  
    
   The QOS TLV is optional. The received PE uses this information as a 
   suggestion.  
    
   Note that use of PW QOS exchange helps utilize core resources 
   effectively in the following manner. 
     . Head end PE selects a transport tunnel that best suits remote 
        Attachment Circuit’s QOS requirement 
     . More PWs can be multiplexed over a transport tunnel 
     . Transport tunnel can be right-sized with various upsize and 
        downsize thresholds 
     . Eliminates the wastage of packet forwarding resources in the 
        core when received traffic exceeds the Attachment Circuit QOS 
        criteria at the tail end. 
    
   7.0 The role of PW QOS in multi-hop PW signaling 
    
   In a multi-segmented Pseudo-wire, each intermediate PE stitches two 
   pseudo-wire segments in order to create a pseudo-wire from source PE 
   to destination PE through multiple PSN domains. In this topology it 
   becomes necessary that each PE hop ‘knows’ what the QOS requirements 
   are for this multi-segmented pseudo-wire so that it can procure the 
   correct network resources in each direction. 
    
   It is expected that source PE may include a set of QOS TLVs, one for 
   each direction, requested and available QOS parameters in the 
   initial Label Mapping message. Each intermediate PE then uses this 
   QOS information to acquire network resources and if unsuccessful, to 
   reject the multi-hop Pseudo-wire generation through that PE hop. The 
   Available QOS TLV could be adjusted at each PE hop in order for the 
   destination PE to determine the suitability of the end-to-end 
   Pseudo-wire path.

   The details for signaling PW QOS and it’s processing at each hops as 
   well as at the source and destination PE would be discussed in the 
   future revision of this document.
