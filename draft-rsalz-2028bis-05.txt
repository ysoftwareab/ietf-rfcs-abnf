1.  Introduction

   The process used by the IETF community for the standardization of
   protocols and procedures is described in [IETFPROCS].  That document
   defines the stages in the standardization process, the requirements
   for moving a document between stages, and the types of documents used
   during this process.  This document identifies some of the key
   individual roles and organizations in that process.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document refers to individual roles in the singular, such as "a
   Document Editor."  In reality, many roles are filled by more than one
   person at the same time.  For clarity, this document does not use
   phrases like "Chair (or co-chair)."

1.2.  Changes since RFC 2028

   The following changes have been made, in no particular order:

   *  Added the role of Responsible Area Director (AD) and re-ordered
      Section 2 to follow the typical workflow.

   *  Added the IETF Administration LLC and the IETF Trust to Section 3.

   *  Changed RFC Editor to RFC Production Center, to reflect the
      changes made by [RFCEDMODEL].

   *  Added Section 6 and Section 1.1 and cleaned up some wording
      throughout the document.

2.  Key Individuals Roles in the Process

   This section describes the individual roles involved in the process.
   It attempts to list the roles in the order in which they are involved
   in the process, without otherwise expressing significance.

2.1.  The Document Editor or Author

   Most Working Groups (WGs) focus their efforts on one or more
   documents that capture its work results.  A Working Group generally
   designates a person to serve as the Editor for a particular document.
   That Document Editor is responsible for ensuring that the contents of
   the document accurately reflect the decisions that have been made by
   the Working Group.

Internet-Draft   Entities Involved in the IETF Standards   February 2022


   When a document is composed and edited mainly by an individual, they
   may be referred to as the Document Author.  The distinction is not
   significant.  This document uses the term Document Editor.

   When a Document Editor is a Chair of the same Working Group, another
   Chair should manage the process around the document.  If another
   Chair is not available, the WG and AD must monitor the process
   especially carefully to ensure that the resulting documents
   accurately reflect the consensus of the Working Group and that all
   processes are followed.  This is the collective obligation of all
   parties involved in the document.

2.2.  The Working Group Chair

   Each Working Group is headed by a Chair who has the responsibility
   for directing the group's activities, presiding over the group's
   meetings, and ensuring that the commitments of the group with respect
   to its role in the Internet standards process are met.  In
   particular, the WG Chair is the formal point of contact between the
   WG and the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), via the AD of
   the area to which the WG belongs.

   The details on the selection and responsibilites of a Working Group
   Chair can be found in [WGPROCS].

2.3.  The Area Director

   The Area Director (AD) assigned as the Reponsible Area Director for a
   Working Group will review documents after the Working Group has
   approved them following a last call.  When satisfied, the AD will
   schedule an IETF last call (when needed) and will coordinate the IESG
   review and approval of the document.

3.  Key Organizations in the Process

   The following organizations and organizational roles are involved in
   the Internet standards process.

3.1.  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

   The IETF is an open international community of network designers,
   operators, vendors, researchers, and other interested parties who are
   concerned with the evolution of the Internet architecture and the
   smooth operation of the Internet.  It is the principal body engaged
   in the development of new Internet Standard specifications and
   related documents.

Internet-Draft   Entities Involved in the IETF Standards   February 2022


3.2.  Working Groups

   The technical work of the IETF is done in its Working Groups, which
   are organized by topics into several Areas
   (https://www.ietf.org/topics/areas/), each one under the coordination
   of an Area Director.  Working Groups typically have a narrow focus
   and a lifetime bounded by completion of specific tasks as defined in
   their charter and milestones.

   For all purposes relevant to the Internet Standards development
   process, membership in the IETF and its Working Groups is defined to
   be established solely and entirely by individuals who participate in
   IETF and Working Group activities.  These individuals do not formally
   represent any organizations they may be affiliated with, although
   affiliations are often used for identification.

   Anyone with the time and interest to do so is entitled and urged to
   participate actively in one or more Working Groups and to attend IETF
   meetings, which are usually held three times a year [MEETINGS].
   Active Working Group participation is possible without attending any
   in-person meetings.

   Participants in the IETF and its Working Groups must disclose any
   relevant current or pending intellectual property rights that are
   reasonably and personally known to the participant if they
   participate in discussions about a specific technology.  The full
   intellectual property policy is defined in [IPRRIGHTS1] and
   [IPRRIGHTS2].

   New Working Groups are established by the IESG and almost always have
   a specific and explicit charter.  The charter can be modified as the
   Working Group progresses.  The guidelines and procedures for the
   formation and operation of Working Groups are described in detail in
   [WGPROCS].

   A Working Group is managed by a Working Group Chair, as described in
   Section 2.2.  Documents produced by the group have an Editor, as
   described in Section 2.1.  Further details of Working Group operation
   can be found in [WGPROCS].

   Working Groups ideally display a spirit of cooperation as well as a
   high degree of technical maturity; IETF participants recognize that
   the greatest benefit for all members of the Internet community
   results from cooperative development of technically superior
   protocols and services.

3.3.  Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)

   The IESG is responsible for the management of the IETF technical
   activities.  It administers the Internet Standards process according
   to the rules and procedures defined in [IETFPROCS].  The IESG is
   responsible for the actions associated with the progression of
   documents along the "standards track", including the initial approval
   of new Working Groups and the final approval of documents.  The IESG
   is composed of the Area Directors and the IETF Chair, who also chairs
   the IESG and is the Area Director for the General Area.  The Chair of
   the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is an ex-officio member of the
   IESG.  Various other bodies have liaisons with the IESG.

   All members of the IESG are nominated by a Nominations Committee
   (colloquially, NomCom), and are confirmed by the IAB.  See [NOMCOM]
   for a detailed description of the NomCom procedures.  Other matters
   concerning its organization and operation are described in the IESG
   charter [IESG].

3.4.  Internet Architecture Board (IAB)

   The IAB provides oversight of the architecture of the Internet and
   its protocols.  The IAB approves IESG candidates put forward by the
   NomCom.

   The IAB provides oversight of the standards process and serves as an
   appeal board for related complaints about improper execution
   [IETFPROCS].  In general, it acts as a source of advice about
   technical, architectural, procedural, and policy matters pertaining
   to the Internet and its enabling technologies.

   The members of the IAB are nominated by the NomCom, and are confirmed
   by the Board of the Internet Society (ISOC).  The IETF Chair is also
   a member of the IAB, and the Chair of the Internet Research Task
   Force (IRTF) is an ex-officio member.  Other matters concerning the
   IAB's organization and operation are described in the IAB charter
   [IAB].

3.5.  The RFC Production Center (RPC)

   Publication of RFCs is handled by the RFC Production Center (RPC),
   including editorial preparation and publication.  RFC policy is
   defined by the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), an open group, and
   approved by the RFC Advisory Board (RSAB), which has appointed
   members.  The RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE) is a position
   funded by the IETF LLC, with responsibilities to consult with all
   parties, and be a member of the advisory board.

Internet-Draft   Entities Involved in the IETF Standards   February 2022


   Full details on the roles and responsibilities of the RPC are
   specified in [RFCEDMODEL], in particular Section 4.

3.6.  Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

   Many protocol specifications include parameters that must be uniquely
   assigned.  Examples of this include port numbers, option identifiers
   within a protocol, and so on.  The Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) is responsible for assigning values to these
   protocol parameters, maintained in parameter registries.  These
   registries are maintained online (https://www.iana.org/protocols).
   Assignments are coordinated by writing an "IANA Considerations"
   section for a given document, as descrribed in [IANADOCS].  The
   IETF's relationship with IANA is defined by formal agreements,
   including [IANAMOU].

   IANA also is responsible for operating and maintaining several
   aspects of the DNS (https://www.iana.org/domains) and coordinating of
   IP address assignments (https://www.iana.org/numbers).

3.7.  Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)

   The IRTF focuses on longer-term research issues related to the
   Internet as a parallel organization to the IETF, which focuses on the
   shorter-term issues of engineering and standards making.

   The IRTF consists of a number of Research Groups (RGs) chartered to
   research various aspects related to the broader Internet.  The
   products these RGs are typically research results that are often
   published in scholarly conferences and journals, but can also be
   published as RFCs on the IRTF's RFC stream.  RGs also sometimes
   develop experimental protocols or technologies, some of which may be
   suitable for possible standardization in IETF.  Similarly, IETF
   working groups sometimes ask RGs for advice or other input.
   Contributions from RGs, however, carry no more weight in the IETF
   than other community input, and go through the same standards setting
   process as any other proposal.

   The IRTF is managed by the IRTF Chair in consultation with the
   Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG).  The IRSG membership
   includes the IRTF Chair, the Chairs of the various RG and possibly
   other individuals ("members at large") from the community.  Details
   of the organization and operation of the IRTF, the ISRG, and its RGs
   may be found in [IRTF], [IABIRTF], [IRTFPRIMER], and [IRTFCHAIR].

3.8.  The IETF Trust

   The IETF Trust is the legal owner of a number of intellectual
   properties for the IETF, IRTF and other related organizations (such
   as IANA).  This includes the IETF trademarks, or copyright licenses
   for IETF contributions including Internet Drafts.  The principles for
   the copyright licenses are described in [IPRRIGHTS1] and [COPYRIGHT],
   and the licenses themselves are documented in the Trust Legal
   Provisions (https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-
   provisions/).

   The Trustees that govern the Trust are selected from the IETF
   community, as described in [TRUSTEES].

3.9.  IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC)

   The IETF Administration Limited Liability Corporation (colloquially,
   the IETF LLC) provides the corporate legal home for the IETF, the
   IAB, and the IRTF.

   The IETF LLC is responsible for supporting the ongoing operations of
   the IETF, managing its finances and budget, and raising money.  It
   regularly reports to the community.  The LLC is the legal entity that
   signs contracts for the IETF Secretariat, meeting hotels, tools
   development contractors, among many others.  The LLC also responds to
   legal requests; these are often subpoenas in patent suits.

   Selection of the LLC Board of Directors is defined in [NOMCOM].

   The IETF Executive Director handles the IETF's daily tasks and
   management, and is overseen by the LLC Board of Directors.

   [ISOCIETF], Section 6 describes the legal relationship between the
   IETF LLC and the Internet Society.

3.10.  IETF Secretariat

   The administrative functions necessary to support the activities of
   the IETF and its various related boards and organizations are
   performed by a Secretariat contracted by the IETF LLC.  The IETF
   Secretariat handles much of the logistics of running the in-person
   meetings, and is responsible for maintaining the formal public record
   of the Internet standards process [IETFPROCS].

3.11.  Internet Society

   Internet standardization is an organized activity of the Internet
   Society (ISOC), with the Board of Trustees being responsible for
   ratifying the procedures and rules of the Internet standards process
   [ISOCIETF].

   The Internet Society also plays an important role in the standards
   process.  It appoints the NomCom Chair, confirms IAB candidates
   selected by the NomCom, and acts as the final authority in the
   appeals process.

   The way in which the members of the Internet Society Board of
   Trustees are selected, and other matters concerning the operation of
   the Internet Society, are described in [ISOC].
