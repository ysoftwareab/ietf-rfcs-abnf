                 DLEP Destination Service Announcement
                     draft-taylor-manet-dlep-dsa-00

Abstract

   When using the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP)
   [I-D.ietf-manet-dlep] to bootstrap neighbour discovery for routing
   protocols there is no indication in the core DLEP protocol of the
   services of the router announced at a destination.  This forces an
   implementation to either rely on a priori configuration or use
   heuristic probing of well-known ports to discover potential routing
   peers.

   This document defines an extension to DLEP to enable a router to
   advertise its active services to its peer modem, allowing a connected
   remote modem to announce the services of a router in a DLEP
   destination message to its peer, removing the need for service
   discovery between routing peers.  The mechanism is designed to be
   sufficiently generic to allow the advertisement of network services
   beyond routing protocols, enabling the fast bootstrapping of other
   protocols such as messaging protocols or header compression.

1.  Introduction

   One of the popular uses of the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP)
   [I-D.ietf-manet-dlep] is to improve the association time of routing
   protocol peers.  When a DLEP Destination Up message is received by a
   router, routing protocol instances can be informed of potential
   peers, enhancing or avoiding the use of timed Hello messages,
   speeding up the convergence of nodes.  In practice this behaviour has
   many benefits, but does also have a downside: When a new potential
   peer is announced via DLEP, every routing protocol active on the
   receiver attempts to communicate with the potential peer trying to

   form a neighbour association, with no prior indication if the
   destination router supports the routing protocol.  Particularly in a
   heterogeneous network when the capabilities of different routers is
   not known in advance, as links form between routers each new router
   may be bombarded by requests to form a routing adjacency from every
   protocol implementation active on every other reachable router in the
   network.

   This document defines an extension to DLEP that introduces a new data
   item to allow a router to announce to its DLEP session peer the list
   of services that it supports, such as the running routing protocols.
   A modem supporting this extension can transmit this information over
   the air using whatever internal protocol it uses for signalling to
   all connected modems.  Every other modem can then attach the received
   list of services to the DLEP Destination Up message that it then
   sends to its DLEP session peer router.  Any changes to the set of
   services can also be sent via the same mechanism, resulting in a
   corresponding DLEP Destination Update message.

   This service announcement may be used to advertise the availability
   of more than just routing protocols.  Other protocols that need peers
   for their operation, such as peer-to-peer messaging applications, or
   discovering the presence of matching protocol compression proxies,
   can also use the same mechanism.

1.1.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Assumptions

   As an extension to DLEP, this document assumes any implementation of
   this extension correctly implements the core DLEP specification
   defined in [I-D.ietf-manet-dlep].  No other DLEP extensions are
   required.

   This extension also assumes that supporting modems have the facility
   to transmit the set of services described by an attached router to
   other modems in the network.

3.  Operation

   To announce support for this extension an implementation MUST follow
   the procedure defined in core DLEP, i.e. Including a DLEP Extension

   Supported data item in the relevant Session Initialization or Session
   Initialization Response message.

   A router uses the Session Update message to advertize its services to
   its local session modem once it enters the DLEP In-Session state, by
   including one or more IPv4 Destination Service data items
   (Section 5.1) and/or IPv6 Destination Service data items
   (Section 5.2) in the message.

   When a modem receives a Session Update message from its local router
   containing one or more Destination Service data items, it SHOULD
   propogate the change in services to all modems that have previously
   announced the local router as a DLEP destination.  Each remote modem
   that receives such a notification SHOULD announce the change in
   remote router services by sending a Destination Update message to
   their attached router containing one or more Destination Service data
   items describing the services.

   When a modem forms a link with a remote modem, it SHOULD announce any
   services announced by the remote router to its local router by
   including one or more Destination Service data items in the
   Destination Up message.

   In order to retract a previously advertised service or announce a new
   service, the router MUST send a new Session Update message to the
   modem containing a relevant Destination Service data item with the
   Add/Remove flag cleared (zero).

   Destination Service data items MUST NOT be included in any DLEP
   Destination message referring to a multicast destination.

3.1.  Service Descriptors

   Services active on a router are described using Service Descriptors,
   that are modelled on DNS SRV records [RFC2782], but with some
   important differences.  A Service Descriptor is a string that
   describes the name of the service, the IP protocol used by the
   service, optionally the name of the service instance, and optionally
   the port number used by the service if not the registered default
   port.

   The format of a Service Descriptor string is defined as:

    Service.Protocol.Name:Port

   Service:  The symbolic name of the desired service, as defined in
      Assigned Numbers [RFC1700] or locally.  The maximum length of a
      Service is 15 characters.  The Service is case insensitive.

Internet-Draft    DLEP Destination Service Announcement    November 2015


   Protocol:  The symbolic name of the desired protocol. 'tcp' and 'udp'
      are at present the most useful values for this field, though any
      name defined by Assigned Numbers or locally may be used (as for
      Service).  The Protocol is case insensitive.

   Name:  OPTIONAL.  The Name of the instance of the service active at
      the destination.  Unlike DNS SRV records, this name MAY not be a
      DNS name, but it MUST use the DNS name syntax.  The Name is case
      insensitive.

   Port:  OPTIONAL.  The port on router of this service.  The range is
      0-65535.  This field SHOULD only be specified if the port differs
      from the value specified in Assigned Numbers.

   As mentioned above, the Name field in a service descriptor MUST
   follow the DNS name syntax, but MAY not be a DNS name, as DLEP is
   often deployed in envrionments where DNS is not available.  However,
   the Name field still serves a purpose as a descriminiator for
   different instances of a service and may be used by a receiving
   router to make peering decisions.

   When a service operates as an IP protocol, rather than TCP, UDP, SCTP
   or DCCP, such as OSPF [RFC2328], the Protocol field MUST be specified
   as 'ip'.

3.1.1.  Service Descriptor ABNF

   service-descriptor = service-part "." protocol-part
                         [ "." name-part [ ":" alt-port ] ]

   service-part       = *( 1*DIGIT [ "-" ] ) ALPHA
                         *( [ "-" ] ALNUM )   ; Maximum 15 characters

   protocol-part      = "tcp" / "udp" / "sctp" / "dccp" / "ip"

   name-part          = label *( "." label )
   label              = ALNUM *( [ "-" ] ALNUM )

   alt-port           = 1*DIGIT              ; Values of 0-65535

   ALNUM              = ALPHA / DIGIT
   ALPHA              = %x41-5A / %x61-7A    ; A-Z / a-z [RFC5234]
   DIGIT              = %x30-39              ; 0-9       [RFC5234]

4.  DLEP Signals and Messages for Destination Service Announcement

   This extension does not introduce any additional DLEP signals or
   messages, and does not alter the semantics of any signals or messages
   defined in the core DLEP specification.

5.  DLEP Data Items for Destination Service Announcement

   This extension introduces two (2) new DLEP data items, described
   below.  Both data items carry information about destination services,
   one for IPv4, the other for IPv6.

   One or more instances of either or both Destination Service data
   items MAY appear in the DLEP Session Update, Destination Up, and
   Destination Update messages.

   A router MAY use one or more instances of either or both data items
   in the DLEP Session Update message to advertise all services that are
   currently available at the router.

   A modem MAY include one or more instances of either or both data
   items in the DLEP Destination Up and Destination Update messages to
   inform locally attached routers of the services available at a remote
   DLEP destination.

   A router announcing services MUST NOT report the same combination of
   address and service in more than one (1) data item per message.  A
   modem that receives multiple data items with the same address and
   service description in a single message SHOULD treat this as an
   invalid data item in the message, and react as defined in the core
   DLEP specification.

   A modem receiving a Destination Service data item with the Add/Remove
   flag cleared (zero) MUST retract any previously announced service
   from it's local router, informing all connected remote modems of the
   change.  If a retraction of a destination service does not match a
   previous announcement, the implementation SHOULD treat this as an
   invalid data item and react as defined in the core DLEP
   specification.

5.1.  IPv4 Destination Service data item

   The IPv4 Destination Service data item contains the following fields:

6.  Security Considerations

   This extension introduces a mechanism for routers to announce their
   services to other potential peers.  In cases where an adversary can
   manipulate the list of services, by either accessing the network
   segment between router or modem, or by intercepting any signalling
   between modems, this list of services may be altered if the link is
   not secured.

   Therefore:

   o  Any implementation MUST follow the security considerations defined
      in the core DLEP protocol.

   o  Any implementation, when used in an environment where the
      signalling between modems may be open to interception, MUST apply
      any relevant security considerations for the modem to modem
      signalling.

   It should be also noted that a malicious router could attempt to deny
   service to a network by rapidly and repeatedly announcing a varying
   set of services, forcing the modems to flood the over the air
   signalling with updates.  A modem implementation MUST be aware of
   this risk and implement mitigations, such as aggregating the changes
   and trottling the updates propogated between devices.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section specifies requests to IANA.

7.1.  Registrations

   This specification defines two (2) new data items for DLEP.
   Assignments from the DLEP data item registry are requested for:

   o  IPv6 Destination Service

   o  IPv4 Destination Service

   The specification also defined an extension to the DLEP protocol.  An
   assignment from the DLEP extension registry is requested for
   'Destination Service Announcement'.
