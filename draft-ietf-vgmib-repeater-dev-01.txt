1.  Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
   managing network repeaters based on IEEE 802.12.


2.  Object Definitions

   Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,
   residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management
   Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related objects are defined
   in MIB modules.  MIB modules are written using a subset of Abstract
   Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1] termed the Structure of Management
   Information (SMI) [2].  In particular, each object type is named by
   an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

3.  Overview

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an IEEE
   802.12 repeater, as defined by Section 12, "RMAC Protocol" in IEEE
   Standard 802.12-1995 [6].

   The definitions presented here are based on Section 13, "Layer
   management functions and services", and Annex C, "GDMO Specifications
   for Demand Priority Managed Objects" of IEEE Standard 802.12-1995
   [6].  Implementors of these MIB objects should note that the IEEE
   document explicitly describes (in the form of Pascal pseudocode)
   when, where, and how various repeater attributes are measured.  The
   IEEE document also describes the effects of repeater actions that may
   be invoked by manipulating instances of the MIB objects defined here.

   The counters in this document are defined to be the same as those
   counters in IEEE Standard 802.12-1995, with the intention that the
   same instrumentation can be used to implement both the IEEE and IETF
   management standards.


3.1.  MAC Addresses

   All representations of MAC addresses in this MIB module are in
   "canonical" order defined by 802.1a, i.e., as if it were transmitted
   least significant bit first.  This is true even if the repeater is
   operating in token ring framing mode, which requires MAC addresses to
   be transmitted most significant bit first.

3.2.  IEEE 802.12 Training Frames

   Training frames are special MAC frames that are used only during link
   initialization.  Training frames are initially constructed by the
   device at the lower end of a link.  The training frame format is as
   follows:

       +----+----+------------+--------------+----------+-----+
       | DA | SA | Req Config | Allow Config |   Data   | FCS |
       +----+----+------------+--------------+----------+-----+

               DA = destination address (six octets)
               SA = source address (six octets)
               Req Config = requested configuration (2 octets)
               Allow Config = allowed configuration (2 octets)
               Data = data (594 to 675 octets)
               FCS = frame check sequence (4 octets)

   Training frames are always sent with a null destination address.  To
   pass training, an end node must use its source address in the source
   address field of the training frame.  A repeater may use a non-null
   source address if it has one, or it may use a null source address.

Internet Draft          IEEE 802.12 Repeater MIB        December 18 1995


   The requested configuration field allows the device at the lower end
   of a link to inform the device at the upper end of the link about
   itself and to request configuration options.  The training response
   frame from the device at the upper end of the link contains the
   requestor's requested configuration from the training request frame.
   The currently defined format of the requested configuration field as
   defined in the IEEE Standard 802.12-1995 standard is shown below.
   Please refer to the most current version of the IEEE document for a
   more up to date description of this field.  In particular, the
   reserved bits may be used in later versions of the standard.

   The allowed configuration field allows the training responder to
   respond with the allowed configuration.  The training initiator sets
   the contents of this field to all zero bits.  The training responder
   sets the allowed configuration field as follows:

       First Octet:       Second Octet:

        7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0    7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       vvv: The version of the 802.12 training protocol with which
            the training responder is compliant.  The current version
            is 100.
       D:   0  = No duplicate address has been detected.
            1  = Duplicate address has been detected
       C:   0  = The requested configuration is compatible with the
                 network.
            1  = The requested configuration is not compatible with
                 the network.  In this case, the FF, PP, and R bits
                 indicate the configuration that would be allowed.
       N:   0  = Access will be allowed, providing the configuration
                 is compatible (C = 0).
            1  = Access is not granted because of security
                 restrictions
       r:   Reserved bits (set to zero)
       FF:  00 = frameType88023 will be used
            01 = frameType88025 will be used
            10 = reserved
            11 = reserved
       PP:  00 = singleAddressMode
            01 = promiscuousMode
            10 = reserved
            11 = reserved
       R:   0  = Requested access as an end node is allowed
            1  = Requested access as a repeater is allowed

   Again, note that the most recent version of the IEEE 802.12 standard
   should be consulted for the most up to date definition of the
   requested configuration and allowed configuration fields.

   The data field contains between 594 and 675 octets and is filled in
   by the training initiator.  The first 55 octets may be used for
   vendor specific protocol information.  The remaining octets are all
   zeros.  The length of the training frame combined with the
   requirement that 24 consecutive training frames be received without
   error to complete training ensures that marginal links will not

   complete training.


3.3.  Structure of the MIB

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into MIB groups.  Each MIB group is
   organized as a set of related objects.

3.3.1.  The Basic Group Definitions

   This group contains the objects which are applicable to all
   repeaters.  It contains status, parameter and control objects for
   each repeater within the managed system, for the port groups within
   the system, and for the individual ports themselves.

3.3.2.  The Monitor Group Definitions

   This group contains monitoring statistics for each repeater within
   the system and for individual ports.

3.3.3.  The Address Tracking Group Definitions

   This group contains objects for tracking the MAC addresses of the
   DTEs attached to the ports within the system.


3.4.  Relationship to other MIBs

   It is assumed that a repeater implementing this MIB will also
   implement (at least) the 'system' group defined in MIB-II [5].


3.4.1.  Relationship to the 'system' group

   In MIB-II, the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory for all
   systems such that each managed entity contains one instance of each
   object in the 'system' group.  Thus, those objects apply to the
   entity even if the entity's sole functionality is management of
   repeaters.


3.4.2.  Relationship to the 'interfaces' group

   In MIB-II, the 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory for
   all systems and contains information on an entity's interfaces, where
   each interface is thought of as being attached to a the Internet
   suite of protocols.)

Internet Draft          IEEE 802.12 Repeater MIB        December 18 1995


   This MIB uses the notion of ports on a repeater.  The concept of a
   MIB-II interface has NO specific relationship to a repeater's port.
   Therefore, the 'interfaces' group applies only to the one (or more)
   network interfaces on which the entity managing the repeater sends
   and receives management protocol operations, and does not apply to
   the repeater's ports.

                      specified in clause 12 [IEEE Std 802.12].

                      Setting this object to noReset(1) has no effect.
                      The agent will always return the value noReset(1)
                      when this object is read.

                      After receiving a request to set this variable to
                      reset(2), the agent is allowed to delay the reset
                      for a short period.  For example, the implementor
                      may choose to delay the reset long enough to
                      allow the SNMP response to be transmitted.  In
                      any event, the SNMP response must be transmitted.

                      This action does not reset the management
                      counters defined in this document nor does it
                      affect the vgRptrPortAdminStatus parameters.
                      Included in this action is the execution of a
                      disruptive Self-Test with the following
                      characteristics:

                          1) The nature of the tests is not specified.
                          2) The test resets the repeater but without
                            affecting configurable management
                            information about the repeater.
                          3) Packets received during the test may or
                             may not be transferred.
                          4) The test does not interfere with
                             management functions.

                      After performing this self-test, the agent will
                      update the repeater health information (including
                      vgRptrInfoOperStatus), and send a

                      Some ports may not be present in the system, in

                      Note:  In practice, this will generally be the
                      number of ports on a module, card, or board, and

                      The agent must reject a SET of this object if the
                      value includes no capabilities that are
                      supported by this port's hardware, as defined by
                      the values of the corresponding instances of
                      vgRptrPortSupportedPromiscMode and
                      vgRptrPortSupportedCascadeMode.

                      Note that vgRptrPortSupportPromiscMode and
                      vgRptrPortSupportedCascadeMode represent what the
                      port hardware is capable of supporting.
                      vgRptrPortAllowedTrainType is used for setting an
                      administrative policy for a port.  The actual set
                      of training configurations that will be allowed
                      to succeed on a port is the intersection of what
                      the hardware will support and what is
                      administratively allowed.  The above requirement
                      on what values may be set to this object says that
                      the intersection of what is supported and what is
                      allowed must be non-empty.  In other words, it
                      must not result in a situation in which nothing
                      would be allowed to train on that port.  However,
                      a value can be set to this object as long as the
                      combination of this object and what is supported
                      by the hardware would still leave at least one
                      configuration that could successfully train on the
                      port."

                      necessary, until the value of
                      vgRptrAddrSearchStatus is 'notInUse'.  The
                      management station then tries to set the same
                      instance of the vgRptrAddrSearchLock object to the
                      value it just retrieved, the same instance of the
                      vgRptrAddrSearchStatus object to 'inUse', and the
                      corresponding instance of vgRptrAddrSearchOwner to
                      a value indicating itself.  If the set operation
                      succeeds, then the management station has obtained
                      ownership of the vgRptrAddrSearchEntry, and the
                      value of vgRptrAddrSearchLock is incremented by
                      the agent (as per the semantics of TestAndIncr).
                      Failure of the set operation indicates that some
                      other manager has obtained ownership of the
                      vgRptrAddrSearchEntry.

                      Once ownership is obtained, the management station

                      can proceed with the search operation.  Note that
                      the agent will reset vgRptrAddrSearchStatus to
                      'notInUse' if it has been in the 'inUse' state
                      for an abnormally long period of time, to prevent
                      a misbehaving manager from permanently locking the
                      entry.  It is suggested that this timeout period
                      be between one and five minutes.

                      When the management station has completed its
                      search operation, it should free the entry by
                      setting the instance of the vgRptrAddrSearchLock
                      object to the previous value + 1, the instance of
                      the vgRptrAddrSearchStatus to 'notInUse', and the
                      instance of vgRptrAddrSearchOwner to a zero length
                      string.  This is done to prevent overwriting
                      another station's lock."
