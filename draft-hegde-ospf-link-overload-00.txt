                   draft-hegde-ospf-link-overload-00

Abstract

   Many OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 deployments run on overlay networks provisioned
   by means of pseudo-wires or L2-circuits. when the devices in the
   underlying network go for maintenance, it is useful to divert the
   traffic away from the node before the maintenance is actually
   scheduled.  Since the nodes in the underlying network are not visible
   to OSPF, existing stub router mechanism described in [RFC3137] cannot
   be used.  It is useful for routers in OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain
   to be able to advertise a link being in overload state to indicate
   impending maintenance activity in the underlying network devices.

   This document describes the protocol extensions to disseminate link
   overload information in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocol.

Internet-Draft             OSPF link overload                 March 2015


1.  Introduction

   It is useful for routers in OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to be
   able to advertise a link being in overload state to indicate
   impending maintenance activity on the link.  This document provides
   mechanisms to advertise link overload state in the flexible encodings
   provided by OSPFv2 Prefix/Link Attribute Advertisement(
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-prefix-link-attr]) and OSPFv3 Extended LSA
   ([I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-lsa-extend]).

   Throughout this document, OSPF is used when the text applies to both
   OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 is used when the text is
   specific to one version of the OSPF protocol.


2.  Link overload sub TLV

2.1.  OSPFv2 Link overload sub TLV

   Link overload sub TLV is carried as part of the Extended link TLV as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ospf-prefix-link-attr] for OSPFv2.

2.2.  OSPFv3 Link overload sub TLV

   Link overload sub TLV is carried in the Router-link TLV as defined in
   the [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-lsa-extend] for OSPFv3.  The Router-Link
   TLV contains the neighbor interface-id and can uniquely identify the
   link on the remote node.

3.  Elements of procedure

   The Link Overload sub TLV indicates that the Link which carries the
   sub TLV is overloaded.  The node that has the link going for
   maintenance, sets metric of the link to MAX-METRIC and re-originates
   the router LSA.  The metric in the reverse direction also need to
   change to divert the traffic from reverse direction.  The node SHOULD
   originate Link overload sub TLV and include it in Extended link TLV
   and originate the Extended Link Opaque LSA as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-prefix-link-attr] for OSPFv2 and E-Router-LSA as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-lsa-extend] for OSPFv3 and flood in
   the OSPF area.

   when the originator of the Link Overload sub TLV, purges the extended
   link opaque LSA or re-originates without the Link Overload sub TLV,
   the metric on the remote node SHOULD be changed back to the original
   value.

   Based on the link type of the overloaded link below actions MAY be
   taken by the receiver.

3.1.  Point-to-point links

   When a link overload TLV is received for a point-to-point link the
   receiver SHOULD identify the local link which corresponds to the

Internet-Draft             OSPF link overload                 March 2015


   overloaded link and set the metric to MAX-METRIC (0xffff).  Receiver
   node MUST re-originate the router-LSA with the changed metric and
   flood into the OSPF area.

3.2.  Broadcast/NBMA links

   Broadcast or NBMA networks in OSPF are represented by a star topology
   where the Designated Router (DR) is the central point to which all
   other routers on the broadcast or NBMA network connect.  As a result,
   routers on the broadcast or NBMA network advertise only their
   adjacency to the DR.  Routers that do not act as DR do not form or
   advertise adjacencies with each other.  For the Broadcast links, the
   MAX-METRIC on the outgoing link cannot be changed since all the
   neighbors are on same link.  Setting the link cost to MAX-METRIC
   would impact paths going via all neighbors.

   When a link-overload TLV is received by the remote end for a
   broadcast/NBMA link


   - If it's DROther or BDR for that link, SHOULD not take any action.

   - If receiving node is DR for the link, it MUST remove the originator
   of the link overload TLV from the list of connected neighbors and
   MUST re-originate the network LSA and flood into the OSPF area.


3.3.  Point-to-multipoint links

   Operation for the point-to-multipoint links is similar to the point-
   to-point links.  When a link overload TLV is received for a point-to-
   multipoint link the receiver SHOULD identify the neighbor which
   corresponds to the overloaded link and set the metric to MAX-METRIC
   (0xffff).  Receiver node MUST re-originate the router-LSA with the
   changed metric and flood into the OSPF area.


4.  Backward compatibility

   The mechanism described in the document is fully backward
   compatible.It is required that the originator and receiver of link-
   overload sub TLV understand the extensions defined in this document
   and in case of broadcast links the originator and the DR need to
   understand the extensions.  Other nodes in the network compute based
   on increased metric and hence the feature is backward compatible.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other
   than those discussed in [RFC2328] and [RFC5340].

   OSPFV3 Router Link TLV Registry
