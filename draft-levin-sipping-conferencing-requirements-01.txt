             Requirements for Tightly Coupled SIP Conferencing 
                                      
    
 
 
1. Scope 
    
   This document examines a wide range of conferencing requirements 
   being applied to a tightly coupled SIP Star conference. 
    
   The requirements are grouped according to their topics in order to 
   define solutions to different topics in parallel. 
    
   Separate documents will map the requirements to existing protocol 
   primitives, define new protocol extensions, and introduce new 
   protocols. 
    
   Together, these documents would provide a guide for building 
   interoperable SIP conferencing applications. 
 
2. Tightly Coupled SIP Conferencing Framework 
 
   SIP conference is an association of SIP User Agents (e.g. conference 
   members) with a central member (e.g. a conference host), which has a 
   direct peer-wise relationship with each other member by means of a 
   SIP dialog. Each dialog can belong to a different SIP session.  
    
   In this framework, the SIP conference graph is always a star. The 
   conference host maintains the correlation among conference's dialogs 
   internally. 
    
   The conference state is defined by a set of information describing 
   the conference in progress. This MAY include the following: all or 
   some participant information such as dialog-ids, media sessions in 
   progress, etc. A complete conference state definition can be found 
   in [5]. 
 
   The conference can be hosted either by a participating entity (e.g. 
   terminal) or by a separate application server. 
    
   Typically to the first case, a terminal is capable of hosing a 
   limited ad hoc conference. Such conference is established using 
   basic conferencing primitives. 
    
   Editor's Note: This is similar to traditional offering from PSTN 
   service providers in audio conferencing such as being able to join 
   independent calls into a multiparty conference.  
    
   Application server offers more robust options including reservation, 
   large conferences, and managed conferences. In addition to the basic 
   functionality, the conferencing server supports any subset of 
   advanced conferencing features, presented in this document. In this 
   case, the conference has a globally routable identifier, such as SIP 
   URI.

             Requirements for Tightly Coupled SIP Conferencing 
                                      
    
    
   The conference properties are defined by a list of configuration 
   parameters (e.g., maximum number of ports/participants, needs chair-
   person supervision or not, password protected or not, duration, 
   etc.) that a conference creator can request from the conference 
   service. Conference properties are configured at the onset of a 
   conference and, typically, need special privileges to be changed. 
    
   Conference participants MAY have different roles or privileges in a 
   conference. For example, a conference Chair MAY have the right to 
   disconnect users from a conference, or terminate the conference. 
    
   SIP conference MAY have media sessions similarly to standard two-
   party SIP calls. The conference media graph is constructed
   independently from the SIP star conference. For example, it can be 
   centralized (e.g. following the star graph of the SIP conference) or 
   it can be de-centralized (such as multicast mesh among the 
   participating entities). As it can be seen from the examples, the 
   function of the media processing can be performed either by the 
   conference host alone or by each one of the participating entities. 
    
3. General Design Guidelines 
 
   GDG-1: Keep It Simple. 
    
   GDG-2: Low Bandwidth Consumption. 
   Mobile low-bandwidth devices represent large portion of user base. 
   Bandwidth consumption on the access link is the most important mobile 
   requirement. 
    
   GDG-3: MUST NOT assume IP Multicast. 
   The solution MUST NOT assume IP multicast since it is not widely 
   available in mobile networks or in residential environments (such as 
   PPPoE). 
    
   GDG-4: The design MUST allow for scalable architecture in order to 
   support large (but still tightly managed) conferences. 
    
   GDG-5: Since the request processing may take long time at the 
   server, the response mechanism SHOULD be asynchronous. 
    
   Editor's note: For example, if a conference creation includes long 
   list of dial-out participants, it may take a long time to have the 
   final response to the request. 
    
4. Discovery Phase Requirements 
    
SIP Entity Conferencing Capabilities Discovery

             Requirements for Tightly Coupled SIP Conferencing 
                                      
    
   Editor's Note: The following requirements can always be achieved by 
   configuration means or/and human agreement. Nevertheless, we feel 
   that automatic means MUST be defined. 
    
   CAPD-1: A standard means MUST be defined for automatic discovery of 
   location of conferencing application server(s).  
    
   CAPD-2: A standard format for expressing UA's conferencing 
   capabilities MUST be defined. Each SIP entity MUST be able to 
   independently express its capabilities as a conference member only 
   and as a conference host. 
 
   CAPD-3: A standard means MUST be defined for retrieving conferencing 
   capabilities of a known SIP entity. In this regard, the SIP entity 
   can be either a user device (e.g. a terminal) or a dedicated 
   conferencing server. 
    
A Particular Conference Location and Information Discovery 
    
   CNFD-1: Given a global identifier of a particular conference, a 
   standard means MUST be defined for locating the hosting entity of 
   this conference. 
    
   CNFD-2: Given a global identifier of a particular conference, a 
   standard means MUST be defined for obtaining the conference 
   properties. 
    
   CNFD-3: Given a global identifier of a particular conference, a 
   standard means MUST be defined for obtaining the conference state 
   information. 
    
5. Basic Conferencing Requirements 
    
Participation of RFC 3261 compliant only User Agent 
    
   BSC-1:  A conference host MUST be able to invite and disconnect an 
   RFC 3261 compliant only SIP UA to and from a SIP conference. 
    
   BSC-2: RFC 3261 compliant only SIP UA's MUST be able to dial-in a 
   particular SIP conference (as per [3]). In this case, only the user 
   behind its UA knows that he dials into the conference. 
    
   Editor's Note: In this case, the conference can be identified either 
   by manually populating the Request-URI field with the conference 
   identifier or, alternatively, by using an IVR service. 
    
Conference Establishment in Dial-Out Scenarios (as per [3]) 
     
   DOUT-1: A means MUST be defined for a conference host to invite a 
   User Agent to one of its active conferences (specified by a 


     
   O. Levin et al.         Expires: January 2003               Page 5 
 

             Requirements for Tightly Coupled SIP Conferencing 
                                      
    
   conference identifier) over an existing SIP dialog between the two. 
   As a result, the dialog becomes a part of the conference. 
 
   DOUT -2: A means MUST be defined for a conference host to invite a 
   User Agent by establishing a new SIP dialog between the two together 
   with specifying the identifier of the conference. The dialog belongs 
   to the conference. 
    
 
Conference Establishment in Dial-In Scenarios (as per [3]) 
     
   DIN-1: Provided desired conference properties and the hosting entity 
   location (as per DS-1 and DS-2), a means MUST be defined for a UA to 
   create an ad-hoc conference [3] and to become its member. A means 
   MUST be defined for creating a global conference identifier for this 
   ad-hoc scenario. 
    
   DIN-2: Provided a reserved conference identifier, a means MUST be 
   defined for a UA to activate the conference and to become its 
   member. 
    
   DIN-3: Provided a reserved conference identifier, a means MUST be 
   defined for a UA to dial-in an active conference and to become its 
   member. 
    
   DIN-4: Provided one of the dialogs ID, belonging to a particular 
   active conference, a means MUST be defined for a UA to dial-in an 
   active conference and to become its member. 
    
Third Party Invitation to a Conference 
    
   THIP-1: Provided a conference identifier, a means MUST be defined 
   for a UA to invite another UA to this conference. 
    
   THIP-2: Provided one of the dialogs ID, belonging to a particular 
   active conference, a means MUST be defined for a UA to invite 
   another UA to this conference. 
    
   THIP-3: Provided a conference identifier, a means MAY be defined for 
   a UA to invite a list of UAs to this conference (a so-called "mass 
   invitation"). 
 
Disconnection of Conference Members and Conference Termination 
     
   TERM-1: A means MUST be defined for a conference host to disconnect 
   a conference member from an active conference. 
    
   TERM-2: A means MAY be defined for a conference host to revert a 
   two-party conference to a basic SIP point-to-point session (and 
   releasing internal conferencing resources).

             Requirements for Tightly Coupled SIP Conferencing 
                                      
    
   TERM-3: Provided a conference identifier, a means MUST be defined 
   for a UA to disconnect another UA from this conference. 
    
   TERM-4: Provided one of the dialogs ID, belonging to a particular 
   active conference, a means MAY be defined for a UA to disconnect 
   another UA from this conference. 
    
   TERM-5: Provided a conference identifier, a means MAY be defined for 
   a UA to disconnect a list of UAs from this conference (a so-called 
   "mass feature"). 
    
   TERM-6: Provided a conference identifier, a means MUST be defined 
   for a UA to disconnect all members from this conference.  
    
   TERM-7: Provided a conference identifier, a means MAY be defined for 
   a UA to terminate this conference by disconnection all the members, 
   releasing conference resources together with the conference 
   identifier. 
    
   Editor's note: Some of the requirements above overlap with each 
   other. 
 
Conference Member Privacy 
    
   The following features depend both on host's capabilities and 
   policies and on members' capabilities. 
    
   A conference host SHOULD support these. A conference member MAY 
   support these. 
     
   PRV-1: A conference member participates in a conference 
   "anonymously", meaning that its presence is known and can be 
   announced but without disclosing its identity. 
    
   PRV-2: A conference member requests anonymous participation from the 
   host. 
    
   PRV-3: A conference member participates in a conference "in a hidden 
   mode", meaning that both its presence and its identity are not 
   disclosed. 
    
   PRV-4: A conference member requests participation in a hidden mode. 
 
6. Conference State Dissemination Requirements 
    
Report of Changes 
     
   CNG-1: It is expected that the set of events related a conference 
   state and required to be reported would grow with time. Therefore, a 
   mechanism for extensible definition/registration of new conference 
   state changes MUST be defined.

             Requirements for Tightly Coupled SIP Conferencing 
                                      
    
  
   CNG-2: A means MUST be defined for reporting the conference state 
   changes to interested parties (including conference members) in a 
   timely manner. The report MAY include more than one change. 
    
   CNG-3: A means MUST be defined for a SIP UA to express its interest 
   in selected state changes only. 
    
   CNG-4: A means MUST be defined for a SIP UA to express the minimum 
   interval between receiving state change reports. 
    
   A means MUST be defined for reporting at least the following changes 
   in a conference state: 
    
   CNG-5: A new conference member joined the conference. 
    
   CNG-6: A Particular conference member left the conference. 
 
On-demand Dissemination 
    
   ODD-1: A means MUST be defined to disseminate any conference state 
   information (as per [5]) to interested parties (i.e. SIP UAs) on-
   demand. 
 
   ODD-2: A means MUST be defined for a SIP UA to request a conference 
   state information of a particular conference defined by the 
   conference identifier. 
    
   ODD-3: A means MUST be defined for a SIP UA to specify the subset of 
   the conference state information, it wants and capable to receive. 
    
7. Miscellaneous Requirements 
    
   MISC-1: A procedure for delegating of a host role by the current 
   host to another member MUST be defined. 
    
   MISC-2: A procedure for requesting a conference host to transfer its 
   role to another conference member MUST be defined. 
    
   MISC-3: A procedure for on-demand unconditional transfer of the host 
   role to a different member MUST be defined. 
    
   MISC-4: A detection procedure for a conference host failure 
   condition MUST be defined. 
    
   MISC-5: In case a conference host failure, a procedure for assigning 
   a new conference host MUST be defined. 
    
   Editor's Note: This is a difficult for standardization requirement.

             Requirements for Tightly Coupled SIP Conferencing 
                                      
    
8. Media Control Requirements 
    
   This section is left for future study. 
   To this point, the listed below requirements have been identified: 
    
   MEDI-1: Each media session between the conference Server and a 
   participant in a conference MUST have a unique identity in the 
   conference space 
    
   MEDI-2: It MUST be possible for a user to participate in a sub-set 
   of media sessions of a conference 
    
   MEDI-3: It MUST be possible to modify media sessions of certain 
   subset of the participants without impacting the sessions of other 
   participants (e.g., introduce side-bar conversations between two 
   participants). 
    
   MEDI-4: It MUST be possible to modify a subset of the media sessions 
   of a participant during the conference (e.g., swap in and out 
   video). 
    
   MEDI-5: A media session of a participant MUST be in one of the 
   following states:  
   - Inactive : SDP attribute=inactive  
   - Active   : opposite of inactive 
   - On-hold  : SDP attribute=sendonly 
   - Disabled : media port = 0 
                 
   MEDI-6: It MUST be possible for the conference server to mix a sub-
   set of the active media sessions in a conference (e.g., mix audio 
   from two most audible speakers). 
    
   MEDI-7: It SHOULD be possible for a participant with appropriate 
   privileges to add (and delete) conference-wide media sessions into 
   (from) the conference, or modify their properties.  
      
9. Conference Access Control List (ACL) 
    
   The purpose of the Access Control List is to define who is allowed 
   (or not allowed) to join the conference. If there is user's join 
   attempt, but user is not in the ACL then (depending on the 
   conference policy), the conference chair MAY be consulted whether 
   the user can be accepted to join the conference. 
    
   ACL-1: There MUST be a mechanism to define Access Control List (ACL) 
   so that user's joins can be pre-authorized (or denied).  
    
   ACL-2: It MUST be possible to add and delete users to/from ACL.

             Requirements for Tightly Coupled SIP Conferencing 
                                      
    
   ACL-3: It MUST be possible to consult a user with appropriate 
   privileges (such as chair) when an unknown user tries to join the 
   conference. The chair may accept or deny the join attempt. 
 
10.     Conference Participant Privileges 
    
Model 
    
   Conference participants MAY have different privileges. 
    
   In the simplest case, only two kinds of participants exist: the  
   conference Chair (with all the privileges), and normal Participants 
   (without any privileges). 
      
   For example, following privileges MAY be supported: 
   -    Right to terminate a conference 
   -    Right to disconnect participants 
   -    Right to manage general conference properties 
   -    Right to manage conference access control list (ACL) 
   -    Right to manage conference-wide media sessions (e.g. add audio 
   session into conference) 
   -    Right to manage other participant's session parameters (such as 
   media) 
   -    Right to make real-time authorization (for join attempts) 
   -    Right to hand-off all (or some of) the above privileges to 
   another participant 
      
   Some conferences may utilize more complex privilege definition and 
   hierarchy; such as guru-participants have the right to disconnect 
   participants. 
    
   Therefore, protocol mechanisms MUST be in place to translate these 
   rights into actions. 
    
    
Requirements 
    
   PRIV-1:  It MUST be possible to define different privileges to 
   different participants.  
    
   PRIV-2: It MAY be possible that different participant levels are 
   defined (e.g. senior-member, panelist).  
    
   PRIV-3: Rules MUST be defined for special cases, such as if chair 
   leaves suddenly, or chair tries to take privileges away from all 
   privilege holders. 
 
11.     Floor Control 
 
Definitions 
    

     
   O. Levin et al.         Expires: January 2003              Page 10 
 

             Requirements for Tightly Coupled SIP Conferencing 
                                      
    
   Conference applications often have shared resources such as the 
   right to talk, input access to a limited-bandwidth video channel, or 
   a pointer or input focus in a shared application. 
    
   In many cases, it is desirable to be able to control who can provide 
   input (send/write/control, depending on the application) to the 
   shared resource. 
    
   Floor control enables applications or users to gain safe and 
   mutually exclusive or non-exclusive input access to the shared 
   object or resource. 
    
   This is an optional feature for conferencing applications. SIP 
   conferencing applications may decide not to implement this feature. 
    
   Floor control has been studied extensively over the years (e.g. [8], 
   [9], [10], [11], and [12]) therefore earlier work can be utilized 
   here. 
    
   A floor control protocol is used to convey the floor control 
   messages among the floor chairs (moderators) of the conference, the 
   conference server and the participants of the conference. 
    
   The centralized conference server controls the floors at least in 
   the signaling level. Controlling also the actual (physical) media 
   resources (e.g. audio mixer) is highly recommended, but beyond the 
   scope of this document. 
    
   Note that the floor is a concept coupled with one or more media 
   sessions. 
   The creation of the media session itself is defined elsewhere. 
   A participant with appropriate privileges may create a floor by 
   defining that existing media session(s) is now floor-controlled. 
 
Requirements 
    
   FLO-1: It MUST be possible to announce that one or more conference's 
   media sessions are floor-controlled. This means that, unless 
   otherwise defined, all floor participants are in passive receive-
   only mode. It MUST also be possible to group more than one media 
   sessions together so that one floor applies to the group of media 
   sessions. 
    
   Editor's note: This announcement can be done e.g. via SDP "fid" 
   extensions ([6] and [7]). 
    
   FLO-2: It MUST be possible to define who is allowed to create a 
   floor in a conference.   
    
   Editor's note: This may be a conference chair, or a participant 
   authorized by conference chair.

             Requirements for Tightly Coupled SIP Conferencing 
                                      
    
 
   FLO-3: It MUST be possible for a participant with appropriate 
   privileges to create a floor with specific parameters, such as how 
   many simultaneous users are allowed.  Similarly, floor modification 
   and termination MUST be supported. 
    
   Example of this is that chair creates a floor (for existing audio 
   session) and defines that max two users are allowed to hold the 
   floor at the same time. The server can then take care of this. 
 
   FLO-4: It MUST be possible to use moderator-controlled floor policy 
   in which the server notifies the floor moderator and waits for the 
   moderator to make decisions. This enables the moderator to fully 
   control who has the floor. The server MAY forward all requests 
   immediately to moderator, or it may do filtering and send only 
   occasional notifications to moderator.  
 
   FLO-5: It MAY be possible that several users are acting as floor 
   moderators. The centralized server may send floor request 
   notifications either sequentially, or at the same time. 
    
   FLO-6: The moderator actions (e.g. floor grant) MUST be atomic and 
   the server MUST cope with "simultaneous write" problem in which many 
   moderators try to make conflicting decisions at the same time. 
 
   FLO-7: Participants MUST be able to request (claim) a floor. 
    
   FLO-8: It MUST be possible (for a floor holder) to release a floor. 
    
   FLO-9: It MUST be possible (for a server or participant with 
   appropriate privileges) to revoke a floor from its current holder. 
    
   FLO-10: It MUST be possible to grant a floor to a participant. 
    
    
   Floor control related parameters are defined when the controlled 
   floor is created, or modified. 
    
   FLO-11: It MUST be possible to manipulate at least the following 
   floor parameters: 
    
   - Floor control chair (this does not have to be the conference 
   chair) 
   - Floor control policy (such as moderator-controlled, FCFS, Random) 
   - Number of simultaneous floor holders 
    
   FLO-12: it MAY be possible to manipulate additional parameters, such 
   as time limits.

             Requirements for Tightly Coupled SIP Conferencing 
                                      
    
   This section is left for future study. 
   To this point, the listed below requirements have been identified: 
 
   MET-1: It SHOULD be possible to merge two existing conferences to 
   form a single conference. 
    
   MET-2: It SHOULD be possible to split an active conference into two 
   or more conferences. 
    
   MET-3: It SHOULD be possible to daisy-chain multiple ongoing 
   conferences. 
    
   Editor's Note: In general, conferencing split and merge operations 
   are extremely difficult. We may consider achieving this 
   functionality by transferring individual participants to other 
   conference using simple SIP means.
