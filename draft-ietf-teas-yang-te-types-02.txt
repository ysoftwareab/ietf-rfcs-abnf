1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] and [RFC7950] is a data modeling language used to
   model configuration data, state data, Remote Procedure Calls, and
   notifications for network management protocols such as NETCONF
   [RFC6241].  The YANG language supports a small set of built-in data
   types and provides mechanisms to derive other types from the built-in
   types.

   This document introduces a collection of common data types derived
   from the built-in YANG data types.  The derived types and groupings
   are designed to be the common types applicable for modeling Traffic
   Engineering (TE) features, e.g. in models defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te], [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo] and
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-rsvp]).

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types             December 2018


3.  Overview

   This document defines two YANG modules for common TE types: ietf-te-
   types for TE generic types and ietf-te-mpls-types for MPLS technology
   specific types.  Other technology specific TE types are outside the
   scope of this document.

3.1.  TE Types Module

   The ietf-te-types module contains common TE types that are
   independent and agnostic of any specific technology or control plane
   instance.

   The ietf-te-types module imports the followinig modules:

   o  ietf-yang-types and ietf-inet-types defined in [RFC6991]

   o  ietf-routing-types defined in [RFC8294]

   The ietf-te-types module contains the following YANG reusable types
   and groupings:

   te-bandwidth:

      A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE bandwidth.  The
      modeling structure allows augmentation for each technology.  For
      un-specified technologies, the string encoded te-bandwidth type is
      used.

   te-label:

      A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE label.  The modeling
      structure allows augmentation for each technology.  For un-
      specified technologies, rt-types:generalized-label is used.

   te-ds-class:

      A type representing the Differentiated-Services (DS) Class-Type of
      traffic as defined in [RFC4124].

   te-label-direction:

      An enumerated type for specifying the forward or reverse direction
      of a label.

   te-hop-type:

      An enumerated type for specifying hop as loose or strict.

   te-global-id:

      A type representing the identifier that uniquely identify an
      operator, which can be either a provider or a client.  The
      definition of this type is taken from [RFC6370] and [RFC5003].
      This attribute type is used solely to provide a globally unique
      context for TE topologies.

   te-node-id:

      A type representing the identifier for a node in a topology.  The
      identifier is represented as 32-bit unsigned integer in the
      dotted-quad notation.  This attribute is mapped to Router ID in
      [RFC3630], [RFC5329], [RFC5305], and [RFC6119].

   te-topology-id:

      A type representing the identifier for a topology.  It is optional
      to have one or more prefixes at the beginning, separated by
      colons.  The prefixes can be the network-types, defined in ietf-
      network, to help user to understand the topology better before
      further inquiry.

   te-tp-id:

      A type representing the identifier of a TE interface link
      termination endpoint (TP) on a specific TE node where the TE link
      connects.  This attribute is mapped to local or remote link
      identifier in [RFC3630] and [RFC5305].

   te-path-disjointness:

      A type representing the different resource disjointness options
      for a TE tunnel path as defined in [RFC4872].

   admin-groups:

      A union type for TE link's classic or extended administrative
      groups as defined in [RFC3630] and [RFC5305].

   srlg:

      A type representing the Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) as defined
      in [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].

   te-metric:

      A type representing the TE link metric as defined in [RFC3785].

      A base YANG identity for supported Label Switched Path (LSP)
      association types as defined in [RFC6780], [RFC4872], [RFC4873].

      A base YANG identity for supported path computation objective
      functions as defined in [RFC5541].

      base YANG identity for supported LSP encoding types as defined in
      [RFC3471].

   lsp-protection-type:

      A base YANG identity for supported LSP protection types as defined
      in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873].

   switching-capabilities:

      A base YANG identity for supported interface switching
      capabilities as defined in [RFC3471].

   specific to MPLS technology.

   The ietf-te-mpls-types module contains the following YANG reusable
   types and groupings:

   backup-protection-type:

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following URIs in the IETF XML registry
   [RFC3688].  Following the format in [RFC3688], the following
   registration is requested to be made.

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-types XML: N/A, the
   requested URI is an XML namespace.

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-mpls-types XML: N/A, the
   requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

   name: ietf-te-types namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-
   types prefix: ietf-te-types reference: RFC3209

   name: ietf-te-mpls-types namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-
   te-mpls-types prefix: ietf-te-mpls-types reference: RFC3209

7.  Security Considerations

   This document defines common TE type definitions (i.e., typedef,
   identity and grouping statements) using the YANG data modeling
   language.  The definitions themselves have no security or privacy
   impact on the Internet, but the usage of these definitions in
   concrete YANG modules might have.  The security considerations
   spelled out in the YANG 1.1 specification [RFC7950] apply for this
   document as well.

8.  Acknowledgement

   The authors would like to thank the members of the multi-vendor YANG
   design team who are involved in the definition of these data types.

   The authors would also like to thank Loa Andersson, Lou Berger,
   Sergio Belotti, Italo Busi, Carlo Perocchio, Francesco Lazzeri, Aihua
