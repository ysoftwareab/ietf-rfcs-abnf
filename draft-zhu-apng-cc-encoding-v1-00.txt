Abstract

   This memo provides methods for transporting Chinese characters
   through, but not limited to, electronic mail [RFC-822] and network
   news [RFC-1036] in the Internet community.

   
Introduction

   As the use of Internet covers more and more Chinese people in the
   world, the need has increased for the ability to send documents
   containing Chinese characters on the Internet.  The methods 
   described in this document provide means of transporting existing 
   Chinese character sets as well as leaving sufficient space for future 
   extension.

   This document describes three kinds of encodings:
      1. ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-CN-EXD
      2. CN-GB and CN-Big5 series
      3. ISO-10646 and Unicode
  
  ISO-2022-CN is based upon ISO-2022 [ISO-2022],   similar  to  earlier
  work on ISO-2022-JP [RFC-1468] and ISO-2022-KR [RFC-1557] for Japanese
  and Korean languages.  It is 7-bit, and supports both simplified Chinese
  characters using GB-2312-80 [GB-2312] and traditional Chinese characters
  using the  first two planes of CNS-11643 [CNS-11643] as well as  ASCII
  [ASCII] charaters.
  
  ISO-2022-CN-EXD is an extended form of ISO-2022-CN that additionally
  supports other GB character sets and all planes of CNS-11643.
  
  CN-GB and CN-Big5 series character sets are 8-bit, and reflect  common
  domestic usage of email on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
  
  ISO-10646 and Unicode are 8-bit character sets, based on the usage of
  ISO/IEC-10646 [ISO-10646] and Unicode[Unicode 1.1].


Specification

1. 7-bit MIME character sets: ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-CN-EXD

 1.1  Description

   Since ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-CN-EXD are 7-bit encodings, they do
   not require the 8-bit SMTP extensions.   ISO-2022-CN-EXD could
   be used to support Big-5 [Big-5] too, while ISO-2022-CN can also
   support almost all the characters in Big-5 (except two seldom-used
   characters).
   <<?? seldom-used ??>>

 1.2  ISO-2022-CN-EXD
   
   The starting code of ISO-2022-CN-EXD is ASCII.  ASCII and Chinese
   characters are distinguished by the use of designations 
   (ESC sequences) and shift functions.

   For example, once the sequence ESC $ ) A (four bytes, hexadecimal 
   values: 1B 24 29 41) appears, in the upcoming bytes, the bytes 
   followed SO (one byte, hexadecimal value 0E) are Chinese characters 
   as defined in GB-2312-80.  To shift back to ASCII, SI (one byte, 
   hexadecimal value 0F) should be used, the bytes followed SI are ASCII
   characters.  Here, the ESC $ ) A is called designation, and SI, SO 
   are shift functions.

   Designations define the Chinese character sets  used  in  the  text. 
   There are three kinds of designations: SOdesignation, SS2designation
   and SS3designation.
   
   The SOdesignation is in the form ESC $ ) <F>,  where  < F>   is  the
    "final character" assigned to the character set by ISO (refer to the
    ISO registry [ISOREG] for more details).  The SS2designatin  is  in
    the form ESC $ * <F>, and the SS3designation is in the form ESC $ + 
   <F> .     A  designation  overrides  any  previous  designation  for
   subsequent octects in the text.
   
   There are four kinds of shifts: SI, SO, SS2 and SS3.
   
   The shift SI (an octet with  hexadecimal  value  0F)   declares  that
   subsequent octets are interpreted in ASCII.

   The shift SO (an octect with hexadecimal  value  0E)   declares  that
   subsequent octets are interpreted in  the  character  set  defined  by
   SOdesignation.

   The shift SS2 (two octets with hexadecimal values  1B  4E)   declares
   that the subsequent two octets are interpreted in the  character  set
   defined by SS2designation, after which the previous interpretation  
   (from SI or SO) is restored.

   The shift SS3 (two octets with hexadecimal values  1B  4F)   declares
   that the subsequent two octets are interpreted in the  character  set
   defined by SS3designation, after which the previous interpretation  
   (from SI or SO) is restored.

   Another example, the sequence ESC $ ) G indicates bytes followed
   SO are Chinese characters from CNS-11643-plane1, until another 
   SOdesignation appears.  The sequence ESC $ * H indicates the two 
   bytes immediately followed SS2 represent a character in CNS-11643-plane2, 
   until another SS2designation is met.
   
   The escape sequence, shift function and character set used in an
   ISO-2022-CN-EXD text are as follows:

   Character sets                                       Shift in with
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
    ASCII                                                    SI
    GB-2312, GB-12345, CNS-11643-plane1, GB-2312+GB-8565     SO
    GB-7589, GB-13131, CNS-11643-plane2                      SS2
    GB-7590, GB-13132 or other new GBs,CNS-11643-plane3 or   SS3
     other planes of CNS-11643

      Note: Currently, there are some GB sets that have not been 
      registered in ISO. Here <X> represents the final character 
      that will be assigned by ISO for those sets.

      ESC $ ) A   Indicates the bytes followed SO are Chinese characters 
                  as defined in GB-2312-80, until another SOdesignation 
                  appears
      ESC $ * <X> Indicates the two bytes immediately followed SS2 is a 
                  Chinese character as defined in GB-7589-87 [GB-7589], 
                  until another SS2designation appears
      ESC $ + <X> Indicates the two bytes immediately followed SS3 is a 
                  Chinese character as defined in GB-7590-87 [GB-7590], 
                  until another SS3designation appears

      ESC $ ) <X> Indicates the bytes followed SO are as defined in 
                  GB-12345-90 [GB-12345], until another SOdesignation
                  appears
      ESC $ * <X> Indicates the two bytes immediately followed SS2 is a 
                  Chinese character as defined in GB-13131-91 [GB-13131], 
                  until another SS2designation appears
      ESC $ + <X> Indicates the two bytes immediately followed SS3 is a 
                  Chinese character as defined in GB-13132-91 [GB-13131], 
                  until another SS3designation appears

      ESC $ ) E   Indicates the bytes followed SO are as defined in GB-2312+
                  GB-8565 [GB-8565], until another SOdesignation appears

      ESC $ ) G   Indicates the bytes followed SO are as defined in 
                  CNS-11643-plane1, until another SOdesignation appears

      ESC $ * H   Indicates the two bytes immediately followed SS2 is a
                  Chinese character as defined in CNS-11643-plane2, until 
                  another SS2designation appears
      ESC $ + I   Indicates the immediate two bytes followed SS3 is a
                  Chinese character as defined in CNS-11643-1992-plane3,
                  until another SS3designation appears
      ESC $ + J   Indicates the immediate two bytes followed SS3 is a 
                  Chinese character as defined in CNS-11643-1992-plane4,
                  until another SS3designation appears
      ESC $ + K   Indicates the immediate two bytes followed SS3 is a
                  Chinese character as defined in CNS-11643-1992-plane5,
                  until another SS3designation appears
      ESC $ + L   Indicates the immediate two bytes followed SS3 is a
                  Chinese character as defined in CNS-11643-1992-plane6,
                  until another SS3designation appears
      ESC $ + M   Indicates the immediate two bytes followed SS3 is a
                  Chinese character as defined in CNS-11643-1992-plane7,
                  until another SS3designation appears

   If there are any GB or CNS characters on a line, there must be a
   shift to ASCII before the end of the line (i.e., before the CRLF),
   because the next line starts in the character set that was shifted to
   before the end of the previous line.  In other words, each line
   starts in ASCII, and ends in ASCII.
   
   Other restrictions are given in the Formal Syntax below.

  1.3   Formal Syntax of ISO-2022-CN-EXD

   The notational conventions used here are identical to those used in
   RFC 822.

   body            ::= *e_line *( *designator *( e_line / h_line ))

   designator      ::= SOdesignator / SS2designator / SS3designator

   SOdesignator ::= ESC "$" ")" final_char

   SS2designator ::= ESC "$" "*" final_char

   SS3designator ::= ESC "$" "+" final_char

   final_char  ::=  final_char_gb / final_char_cns

   final_char_gb ::="A" / "E" / <X>

   final_char_cns  ::= "G" / "H" / "I" / "J" / "K" / "L" / "M"

   e_line          ::= *text CRLF

   h_line          ::= *text 1*( segment *text ) CRLF

   segment         ::= ( SO / SS2 / SS3 ) 1*(one_of_94 one_of_94) SI

                                                     ; ( Octal, Decimal.)

   ESC             ::= <ISO-646 ESC, escape>         ; ( 33, 27.)

   SI              ::= <ASCII SI, shift in>          ; ( 17, 15.)

   SO              ::= <ASCII SO, shift out>         ; ( 16, 14.)

   SS2             ::= <ISO 2022 Single_shift two>   ; ( 33 116, 27 78.)

   SS3             ::= <ISO 2022 Single_shift three> ; ( 33 117, 27 79.)

   SP              ::= <ASCII SP, space>             ; ( 40, 32.)

   one_of_94       ::= <any char in 94_char set>     ; (41-176, 33-126.)

   CHAR            ::= <any ASCII character>         ; ( 0-177, 0.-127.)

   text            ::= <any CHAR, including bare CR & bare LF, but NOT
                       including CRLF, ESC, SI, or SO>  

   The name given to this character encoding is "ISO-2022-CN-EXD". This name
   is intended to be used as the "charset" parameter in MIME messages.

   The ISO-2022-CN-EXD encoding is already in 7-bit form, so it is not
   necessary to use a Content-Transfer-Encoding header.

   ISO-2022-CN-EXD may also be used in MIME2 headers.


  1.4  ISO-2022-CN

   The encoding which has the same syntax as ISO-2022-CN-EXD except that
   it only supports characters from ASCII, GB-2312, and CNS-11643-plane1,2
   is called ISO-2022-CN.  It is a subset of ISO-2022-CN-EXD.

   Therefore, ISO-2022-CN is also in 7-bit form, and it is not necessary
   to use a Content-Transfer-Encoding header in MIME.  The name
   "ISO-2022-CN" is intended to be used as the "charset" parameter in
   MIME messages, and may also be used in MIME2 headers.

  1.5  Support Big-5 with ISO-2022-CN

     <<??? Could Mr. TC.Kao complete this paragraph: give the formular of 
     convertion ? >>


2. 8-bit MIME character sets: CN-GB, CN-Big5 series

   The CN-GB,CN-Big5 series of charset names are given below.
   Among other things, these support current practice; 
   specifically, CN-GB reflects the current usage for simplified
   Chinese e-mail, and CN-Big5 reflects the current usage for
   traditional Chinese e-mail.

     Note: the use of 8-bit character sets requires the use of
     either an 8-to-7 Content-Transfer-Encoding mechanism such as
     "BASE64" or "QUOTED-PRINTABLE" if the network is not 8-bit clean,
     or the 8-bit SMTP extensions [SMTPEXT] with the "8BIT"
     Content-Transfer-Encoding on 8-bit clean networks.  Otherwise,
     an 8-bit message which passes through a 7-bit mailer is likely
     to have the 8th bit truncated, resulting in an unreadable
     message.  Although "just send 8-bit data" has been common
     practice in the past, it is incorrect according to the
     Internet standards and causes interoperability problems.

 2.1   CN-GB and CN-GB-xxxxx-xx

   GB characters are usually used in this way in software:

   GB-2312-80 characters are used with ASCII characters, not
   GB-1988-80 [GB-1988].

   GB-2312-80 is also 7-bit, to avoid conflicting with ASCII.  If the
   character is from GB-2312-80, the MSB (bit-8) of each byte is set to 
   1, and therefore becomes a 8-bit character.  Otherwise, the byte is
   interpreted as ASCII.  This constructs a character set named "GB
   Internal Code".

   This method is also adopted in the .gb files in the Internet.

   To use this character scheme with MIME, CN-GB is used as the value
   for the charset parameter:
      Content-Type: text/plain; charset=cn-gb

   There are character sets other than GB-2312-80 in GB.  They can be
   used with the format of CN-GB-xxxxx-xx, in which xxxxx is the GB
   standard number, and xx is the year of edition.  They should be
   coded in 8-bit as CN-GB.

   Currently, these GB standards are GB-7589-87, GB-7590-87, GB-12345-90, 
   GB-13131-91 and GB-13132-91.  GB-7589-87 and GB-7590-87 supplement the 
   simplified characters in GB-2312-80.  Each character in GB-12345-90, 
   GB-13131-91, and GB-13132-91 are traditional Chinese characters that 
   correspond to the character in GB-2312-80, GB-7589-87, and GB-7590-87 
   with the same code.  Therefore, their "charset" names should be 
   CN-GB-7589-87,CN-GB-7590-87, CN-GB-12345-90, CN-GB-13131-91 and 
   CN-GB-13132-91.

   There is also a kind of dependent character set that can only be used
   with one of the above sets.  For example, if GB-8565 is used, it can
   only be used with GB-2312 or GB-12345, in this case, "+" is permitted
   to appear in the charset name, i.e. CN_GB-2312-80+GB-8565-88.

   CN-GB and CN-GB-xxxxx-xx may also be used in MIME2 headers.

   To avoid hindering interoperability, CN-GB is encouraged to be used
   whenever possible.

  2.2   CN-Big5 and CN-Big5-<variant>-<edition>

   BIG-5 is a character set of traditional Chinese characters, widely
   used in Taiwan and overseas.  E-mail using BIG-5 characters is
   sent in this way:

   BIG-5 characters are used with ASCII characters.

   BIG-5 is a two-byte coding, in which the first byte is 7-bit,  and
   the second byte is 8-bit.  If the character is from BIG-5, the MSB
   (bit-8) of the first byte is set to 1, and therefore becomes an 8-bit
   character.  Otherwise, the byte is interpreted as ASCII.  (Big-5 uses
   the code space: [0xa1-0xfe,0x40-0x7e] and [0xa1-0xfe,0xa1-0xfe], and
   two other user areas with the first byte in the range of [0x81-0xa0].)

   To use this character scheme with MIME, CN-Big5 is used as the value
   for the charset parameter:
      Content-Type: text/plain; charset=cn-big5

   The <variant> and <edition> indicates manufacturer's version and year
   of edition which some implementations might want to check.  These are
   optional.

   CN-Big5 and CN-Big5-<variant>-<edition> may also be used in MIME2
   headers.

   To avoid hindering interoperability, CN-Big5 is encouraged to be
   used whenever possible (as opposed to a variant).


3. 8-bit MIME character sets:  Unicode, ISO-10646

   Many Chinese characters are supported by Unicode, ISO-10646.
   They can also be transferred in Unicode or 10646 forms.  For
   details of using Unicode with MIME, refer to RFC-1641 [RFC-1641],
   RFC-1642[RFC-1642].  For assigned names for 10646 sets, refer to
   RFC-1700 [RFC-1700].



Background Information

1. Use of Chinese in Chinese-speaking nations and regions

   The mainland provinces of China use simplified Chinese character in 
   daily life.  GB is the standard electronic character set.  It is the
   main means for communications between people who share simplified 
   Chinese characters in the world.

   Taiwan uses traditional Chinese characters in daily life. Big-5 is 
   a widely-used character set of traditional Chinese characters, and 
   the de-facto industrial standard in Taiwan, while CNS-11643 is a formal
   way for information interchange.

   Hong Kong uses traditional Chinese characters in daily life, but uses
   both GB and Big-5 in electronic form, because Hong Kong people often
   communicate with people in all of China's provinces.

   Singapore seldom uses Chinese characters, and uses the simplified
   form when Chinese characters are used.  In electronic form, Unicode
   is more popular, however GB is also used.

2. About ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-CN-EXD

   ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-CN-EXD encodings are based on the usage of 
   ISO 2022.

3. Miscellaneous about Chinese character sets

   The GB-1988-80 character set is identical to ISO 646 [ISO-646] except 
   for currency symbol and tilde. The currency symbol and the tilde are 
   replaced by the Yuan sign and a short line.  This set is GB's variant 
   of ISO 646.  This character set and CNS-5205 [CNS-5205] are not 
   encouraged for use in the Internet, since ASCII combined with GB-2312 or
   CNS-11643-plane 1 and plane 2 comprises all characters in them.

   The GB-2312-80 character set consists of simplified Chinese
   characters, digits, Latin, Greek and Russian alphabets, and some
   other symbols; in all, 7445 characters.  Each character is two bytes.

   CNS-11643 is a character set used in Taiwan.  It contains several 
   character planes (sub-character sets) arranged as an 94x94 character 
   set for each plane.  Plane 1 and Plane 2 contain nearly the same 
   characters as the Big-5 character set and the same code sequences,
   with some additional symbols.  <<??move to 1.5 of the "Specification"
   part"??>>


4. Miscellaneous implementation information

   For maximum interoperability, implementations SHOULD at least support
   sending and receiving ISO-2022-CN.  Supportting all registered character 
   sets in ISO-2022-CN-EXD is greatly encouraged.

   It is also better to be able to support CN-GB (the status quo for
   simplified Chinese e-mail ) and CN-Big5 (the status quo for traditional
   Chinese e-mail).  But sending ISO-2022-CN message is always encouraged 
   whenever possible.
   
   To the maximum extent possible, implementations should be capable of
   displaying messages in any of the encodings introduced in this document,
   even if they only transmit messages in one form.  Ideally, this would be 
   done by shifting to the appropriate font (e.g. on X-windows displays) but
   suitable translation tables may also be used.

   <<??Misunderstandings that ESC cannot pass different softwares??>>
   
   The human user (not implementor) should try to keep lines within 80
   display columns, or, preferably, within 75 (or so) columns, to allow
   insertion of ">" at the beginning of each line in excerpts. Each
   Chinese character takes up two columns, and the shift sequences do
   not take up any columns. The implementor is reminded that Chinese
   characters take up two bytes and should not be split in the middle to
   break lines for displaying, etc.


X.400 Considerations

   X.400 has the ability of carrying different character sets in a
   message by using the body part "GeneralText" defined by ISO/IEC-10021-7.
   [ISO-10021].

   The X.400 ASN.1 definition of the GeneralText body part is:

      general-text-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE
        PARAMETERS GeneralTextParameters IDENTIFIED BY id-ep-general-text
        DATA       GeneralTextData
        ::= id-et-general-text

      GeneralTextParameters ::= SET OF CharacterSetRegistration

      CharacterSetRegistration ::= INTEGER (1..32767)

      GeneralTextData ::= GeneralString

   Therefore, using ISO-2022-CN simply set the "CharacterSetRegistration"
   part as 6,58,171,172.
   <<??Ask the author of RFC-1502--Harald Tveit Alvestrand-- to see whether 
   the numbers should be quoted in ( and ) ??But mail sent to Harald--
   Harald.Alvestrand@delab.sintef.no-- got bounced, could Mark help ?>>

   Similiarly, using ISO-2022-CN-EXD should set the registered numbers of
   all character sets in the "CharacterSetRegistration" part.  For the
   registered numbers, please refer to ISO registry.  Besides character
   sets supported by ISO-2022-CN, currently registered numbers are:

     GB-2312+GB-8565:   ???
     CNS-11643-plane-3: ???
     CNS-11643-plane-4: ???
     CNS-11643-plane-5: ???
     CNS-11643-plane-6: ???
     CNS-11643-plane-7: ???

   For ISO-10646 and Unicode, <<?????>>

   For CN-GB and CN-Big5 series of character sets, currently there is 
   no formal methods that could be used in X.400 yet.

   For detail about X.400 use of character sets, please refer to 
   RFC-1502 [RFC-1502].
