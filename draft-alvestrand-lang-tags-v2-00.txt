  Abstract


  This document describes a language tag for use in cases
  where it is desired to indicate the language used in an
  information object.
  It also defines a Content-language: header, for use in the
  case where one desires to indicate the language of
  something that has RFC-822-like headers, like MIME body
  parts or Web documents, and a new parameter to the

  1. Introduction


  There are a number of languages spoken by human beings in
  this world.
  A great number of these people would prefer to have
  information presented in a language that they understand.
  In some contexts, it is possible to have information in
  more than one language, or it might be possible to provide
  tools for assisting in the understanding of a language
  (like dictionaries).
  A prerequisite for any such function is a means of
  labelling the information content with an identifier for
  the language in which is is written.
  In the tradition of solving only problems that we think we
  understand, this document specifies an identifier
  mechanism, and one possible use for it.


  2. The Language tag


  The language tag is composed of 1 or more parts: A primary
  language tag and a (possibly empty) series of subtags.

  The syntax of this tag in RFC-822 EBNF is:

   Language-Tag = Primary-tag *( "-" Subtag )
   Primary-tag = 1*8ALPHA
   Subtag = 1*8ALPHA

  Whitespace is not allowed within the tag.
  All tags are to be treated as case insensitive; there exist
  conventions for capitalization of some of them, but these
  should not be taken to carry meaning.

  The namespace of language tags is administered by the IANA
  according to the rules in section 5 of this document.
  The following registrations are predefined:
  In the primary language tag:

  Tags for the names of languages          H. T. Alvestrand

                                       Expires December 1999



  @ All 2-letter tags are interpreted according to ISO
     standard 639, "Code for the representation of names of
     languages" [ISO 639].
  @ All 3-letter tags are interpreted according to ISO 639
     part 2], "Codes for the representation of names of
     languages -- Part 2: Alpha-3 code [ISO 639-2
  @ The value "i" is reserved for IANA-defined registrations
  @ The value "x" is reserved for private use. Subtags of
     "x"will not be registered by the IANA.
  @ Other values cannot be assigned except by updating this
     standard.

  The reason for reserving all other tags is to be open
  towards new revisions of ISO 639; the use of "i" and "x" is
  the minimum we can do here to be able to extend the
  mechanism to meet our requirements.
  In the first subtag:

   - All 2-letter codes are interpreted as ISO 3166 alpha-2
     country codes denoting the area in which the language is
     used.
   - Codes of 3 to 8 letters may be registered with the IANA
     by anyone who feels a need for it, according to the rules
     in chapter 5 of this document.

  The information in the subtag may for instance be:

   - Country identification, such as en-US (this usage is
     described in ISO 639)
   - Dialect or variant information, such as no-nynorsk or en-
     cockney
   - Languages not listed in ISO 639 that are not variants of
     any listed language, which can be registered with the i-
     prefix, such as i-cherokee
   - Script variations, such as az-arabic and az-cyrillic

   In the second and subsequent subtag, any value can be
   registered.
   NOTE: The ISO 639/ISO 3166 convention is that language
   names are written in lower case, while country codes are
   written in upper case.
  This convention is recommended, but not enforced; the tags
  are case insensitive.

  ISO 639 defines a registration authority for additions to
  and changes in the list of languages in ISO 639. This
  authority is:

  2.1 Choice of language tag

  One may occasionally be faced with several possible tags
  for the same body of text.
  Interoperability is best served if all users send the same
  tag; therefore, the following guideline is recommended:
  1.      Use the most precise tagging that you are certain of.
  2.      When a language has both an ISO 639-1 2-character tag and
     an ISO 639-2 3-character tag, use the ISO 639-1 2-
     character tag.
  3.      When a language has both an ISO 639-2/T (Terminology) tag
     and an ISO 639-2/B (Bibliographic) tag, and these differ,
     use the Terminology tag. (NOTE: So far, all languages for
     which there is a difference have 2-character tags. So
     this situation will hopefully not arise.)
  4.      When a language has both an IANA-registered tag (i-
     something) and an ISO registered tag, use the ISO tag.

  5.      Do NOT use the UNK (Unknown) tag unless the protocol in
     use forces you to give a value for the language tag, even
     if you don't know the language. Omitting the tag is
     preferred.
  6.      Do NOT use the MUL (Multiple) tag if the protocol allows
     you to use multiple languages, as is the case for the
     Content-Language: header.


  2.2 Meaning of the language tag


  The language tag always defines a language as spoken (or
  written) by human beings for communication of information
  to other human beings.
  Computer languages are explicitly excluded.
  There is no guaranteed relationship between languages whose
  tags start out with the same series of subtags; especially,
  they are NOT guraranteed to be mutually comprehensible,
  although this will sometimes be the case.
  Applications should always treat language tags as a single
  token; the division into main tag and subtags is an
  administrative mechanism, not a navigation aid.
  The relationship between the tag and the information it
  relates to is defined by the standard describing the
  context in which it appears.
  So, this section can only give possible examples of its
  usage.
   - For a single information object, it should be taken as
     the set of languages that is required for a complete
     comprehension of the complete object.
     Example: Simple text.
   - For an aggregation of information objects, it should be
     taken as the set of languages used inside components of
     that aggregation.  Examples: Document stores and
     libraries.
   - For information objects whose purpose in life is
     providing alternatives, it should be regarded as a hint
     that the material inside is provided in several
     languages, and that one has to inspect each of the
     alternatives in order to find its language or languages.
     In this case, multiple languages need not mean that one
     needs to be multilingual to get complete understanding of
     the document.
     Example: MIME multipart/alternative.
   - It would be possible to define (for instance) an SGML DTD
     that defines a <LANG xx> tag for indicating that
     following or contained text is written in this language,
     such that one could write "<LANG FR>C'est la vie</LANG>";

     the Norwegian-speaking user could then access a French-
     Norwegian dictionary to find out what the quote meant.

  2.3 Language-range

  Since the writing of RFC 1766, it has become apparent that
  there's a need for defining a term for a set of languages
  that share some common property. The following definition
  of language-range is mostly lifted verbatim from RFC 2068
  (HTTP/1.1).

            language-range  = ( ( 1*8ALPHA *( "-" 1*8ALPHA )
  ) | "*" )

  A language-range matches a language-tag if it exactly
  equals the tag, or if it exactly equals a prefix of the tag
  such that the first tag character following the prefix is
  "-".
   The special range "*" matches every tag. A protocol which
  uses language ranges may specify more rules about the
  semantics of "*"; for instance, HTTP/1.1 specifies that it
  only matches languages not matched by any other range
  within an Accept-Language: header.
  Note: This use of a prefix matching rule does not imply
  that language tags are assigned to languages in such a way
  that it is always true that if a user understands a
  language with a certain tag, then this user will also
  understand all languages with tags for which this tag is a
  prefix. The prefix rule simply allows the use of prefix
  tags if this is the case.



  3. The Content-language header

  The Language header is intended for use in the case where
  one desires to indicate the language(s) of something that
  has RFC-822-like headers, like MIME body parts or Web
  documents.
  The RFC-822 EBNF of the Content-Language header is:
   Language-Header = "Content-Language" ":" 1#Language-tag

  Note that the Language-Header is allowed to list several
  languages in a comma-separated list.
  Whitespace is allowed, which means also that one can place
  parenthesized comments anywhere in the language sequence.

  3.1 Examples of Content-language values


  NOTE: NONE of the subtags shown in this document have
  actually been assigned; they are used for illustration
  purposes only.

  official versions of Norwegian. (Both versions are readable
  by all Norwegians).

  is spoken in several countries, but with about half the
  speakers in Norway, with six different, mutually
  incomprehensible dialects:

     Content-Language: i-sami-no (North Sami)
  @

  An English-French dictionary

     Content-type: application/dictionary
     Content-Language: en, fr (This is a dictionary)

     Content-Language: en, fr, de, da, el, it
  @

  An excerpt from Star Trek
     Content-type: video/mpeg
     Content-Language: x-klingon



  4. Use of Content-Language with Multipart/Alternative


  When using the Multipart/Alternative body part of MIME, it
  is possible to have the body parts giving the same
  information content in different languages. In this case,
















  draft-alvestrand-lang-tags-00.txt                [Page 7]
  Tags for the names of languages          H. T. Alvestrand

                                       Expires December 1999



  one should put a Content-Language header on each of the
  body parts, and a summary Content-Language header onto the
  Multipart/Alternative itself.

  4.1 The differences parameter to multipart/alternative

  As defined in RFC 1541, Multipart/Alternative only has one
  parameter: boundary.
  The common usage of Multipart/Alternative is to have more
  than one format of the same message (f.ex. PostScript and
  ASCII).
  The use of language tags to differentiate between different
  alternatives will certainly not lead all MIME UAs to
  present the most sensible body part as default.
  Therefore, a new parameter is defined, to allow the
  configuration of MIME readers to handle language
  differences in a sensible manner.
       Name: Differences
       Value: One or more of
             Content-Type
             Content-Language

  @
  Further values can be registered with IANA; it must be the
  name of a header for which a definition exists in a
  published RFC.  If not present, Differences=Content-Type is
  assumed.
  The intent is that the MIME reader can look at these
  headers of the message component to do an intelligent
  choice of what to present to the user, based on knowledge
  about the user preferences and capabilities.
  (The intent of having registration with IANA of the fields
  used in this context is to maintain a list of usages that a
  mail UA may expect to see, not to reject usages.)
  (NOTE: The MIME specification [RFC 1521], section 7.2,
  states that headers not beginning with "Content-" are
  generally to be ignored in body parts. People defining a
  header for use with "differences=" should take note of
  this.)
  The mechanism for deciding which body part to present is
  outside the scope of this document.
  MIME EXAMPLE:

  @
  Content-Type: multipart/alternative; differences=Content-
  Language;
            boundary="limit"
  Content-Language: en, fr, de
  @

  --limit
  Content-Language: fr
  @

  Le renard brun et agile saute par dessus le chien paresseux
  --limit
  Content-Language: de
  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

  @

  Der schnelle braune Fuchs h=FCpft =FCber den faulen Hund
  --limit
  Content-Language: en
  @

  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
  --limit--
  @

  When composing a message, the choice of sequence may be
  somewhat arbitrary. However, non-MIME mail readers will
  show the first body part first, meaning that this should
  most likely be the language understood by most of the
  recipients.


  5. IANA registration procedure for language tags

  Any language tag must start with an existing tag, and
  extend it.
  This registration form should be used by anyone who wants
  to use a language tag not defined by ISO or IANA.

  The language form must be sent to <ietf-languages@iana.org>
  for a 2-week review period before it can be submitted to

  IANA.  (This is an open list. Requests to be added should
  be sent to <ietf-languages-request@iana.org>.)

  When the two week period has passed, the language tag
  reviewer, who is appointed by the IETF Applications Area
  Director, either forwards the request to IANA@ISI.EDU, or
  rejects it because of significant objections raised on the
  list.

  Decisions made by the reviewer may be appealed to the IESG.
  All registered forms are available online in the directory

  6. Security Considerations

  Security issues are believed to be irrelevant to this memo.


  7. Character set considerations

  Codes may always be expressed using the US-ASCII character
  repertoire (a-z), which is present in most character sets.
  The issue of deciding upon the rendering of a character set
  based on the language tag is not addressed in this memo;
  however, it is thought impossible to make such a decision
  correctly for all cases unless means of switching language
  in the middle of a text are defined (for example, a
  rendering engine that decides font based on Japanese or
  Chinese language will fail to work when a mixed Japanese-
  Chinese text is encountered)

  This may be a political problem related to recent events in
  the Balkans; Serbian (sr, srp, scc) and Croatian (hr, hrv,
  scr) both have their own language codes.


  Appendix B: Changes from RFC 1766


  @ Email list address changed from ietf-types@uninett.no to
     ietf-languages@iana.org
  @ Updated author's address
  @ Added language-range construct from HTTP/1.1
  @ Added use of ISO 639-2 language codes
  @ Added list of language codes


  Appendix X: TODO list

  Here is the list of changes that need to be done to this
  doc before advancing it to Draft or reissuing it.
   - Find out whether anyone supports the
     multipart/alternative;difference= stuff; rip it out if
     not.
   - Fix document heading, boilerplate and formatting
