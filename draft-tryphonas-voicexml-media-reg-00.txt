Abstract

   This document defines the 'application/voicexml+xml' media type
   for the VoiceXML based markup language.
   
1. Introduction

   VoiceXML is an XML based markup language designed for creating audio dialogs
   that feature synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken and 
   DTMF key input, recording of spoken input, telephony, 
   and mixed-initiative conversations.

   Feedback or discussion about this draft should be directed to the
   Voice Browser Working Group public mailing list, www-voice@w3.org
   with archives at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-voice/.


2. Registration of MIME media type application/voicexml+xml

   MIME media type name:      application
   MIME subtype name:         voicexml+xml
   Required parameters:       none
   Optional parameters:

     charset       
       This parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter
       of the "application/xml" media type as specified in RFC 3023 [XMLMIME].

  Encoding considerations:
     See Section 4 of this document.

  Security considerations:
     See Section 7 of this document.

  Interoperability considerations:
     

  Published specification:
     See [VOICEXML1].

  Applications which use this media type:
     Content authors and developers have already begun hand and tool
     authoring on the Web with VoiceXML v2.0.  

     
  Additional information:

     Magic number:
       There is no single initial byte sequence that is always present
       for VoiceXML files. See RFC 3023 [XMLMIME] for information pertaining to
       the identification of XML media types.

     File extension: .vxml

     Macintosh File Type code: TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:
     Steph Tryphonas <s-tryphonas@tellme.com>
     Brad Porter <b-porter@tellme.com>

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Author/Change controller:
     The VoiceXML v2.0 specification is a work product of the World
     Wide Web Consortium's Voice Browser Working Group.  The W3C has change
     control over this specification.

3. Fragment identifiers

   For documents labeled as 'application/voicexml+xml', the fragment
   identifier notation is exactly that for application/xml, as
   specified in RFC 3023 [XMLMIME].

4. Encoding considerations

   The considerations as specified in RFC 3023 [XMLMIME] also 
   hold for 'application/voicexml+xml'. 


5. Recognizing VoiceXML

   All VoiceXML files will have the string "<vxml" near the beginning
   of the file.  Some will also begin with an XML declaration
   which begins with "<?xml", though that alone does not indicate
   an VoiceXML document.  

   All VoiceXML files may also include a declaration of the VoiceXML
   namespace.  This should appear shortly after the string
   "<vxml", and should read 'xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml"'.

6. Charset default rules

   The considerations as specified in RFC 3023 [XMLMIME] also 
   hold for 'application/voicexml+xml'. 

7. Security considerations

   The considerations as specified in RFC 3023 [XMLMIME] also
   hold for 'application/voicexml+xml'.
