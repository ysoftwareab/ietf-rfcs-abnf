1.  Introduction

   This draft proposes several new block types to augment those defined
   in RFC3611 for use in Quality of Service reporting for multimedia
   applications.  
   The block types described include:
   
     - High resolution VoIP performance metrics blocks
     - Modem/ Fax performance metrics blocks
     - Video performance metrics blocks


2.  Requirements


3.  High Resolution VoIP Metrics Report Blocks

   For certain types of VoIP service it is desirable to report VoIP
   performance metrics to a higher resolution than provided in the
   RFC3611 VoIP Metrics block or RFC3550 Receiver Reports. The report
   blocks described in this section provide both interval based and
   cumulative metrics with a higher resolution than that provided in
   the RFC3611 VoIP metrics report block.

3.2 Header

   Four additional blocks are defined

   Block types:		
     HR VoIP Metrics - Cumulative - Locally Generated
     HR VoIP Metrics - Cumulative - Relayed from Remote Endpoint
     HR VoIP Metrics - Interval - Locally Generated
     HR VoIP Metrics - Interval - Relayed from Remote Endpoint

   An extension octet indicates that the block contains a vendor 
   specific extension field.  A value of 0 indicates no extension, a
   value of 1 indicates a T.35 Vendor ID and a value of 2 indicates a
   proprietary format.

   The block length indicates the length of this report in 32 bit 
   words and includes any extension octets.

   Note that variable length fields have been appended to this block
   to allow systems that cannot accomodate variable length RTCP payloads
   to ignore these fields.

3.3 Correlation tag
   A correlation tag has been added to facilitate the correlation of 
   this payload with other call or session related data or endpoint 
   data.

3.4 Loss/ Discard Metrics
   The definitions of loss, discard, burst and gap are identical to 
   those defined in RFC3611 however the resolution of the reported 
   metrics is extended to 16 bit for loss/ discard and 32 bit for 
   durations.  Loss/ discard rates are reported as percentages in 8:8 
   format (i.e. 1.3% = 01 4C).

3.5 Delay Metrics
   Delay metrics are essentially as per RFC3611 however a new External 
   Network Delay parameter has been added (in RFC3611 this could be 
   optionally included in End System Delay).  This parameter is 
   intended to indicate external network round trip delay through 
   cellular, satellite or other types of network with significant 
   delay impact.

3.6 PDV/Jitter Metrics

   Jitter metrics defined are:

    (i)  Mean PDV - for cumulative reports this is a running average of 
         PDV and for interval reports this is an interval average

    (ii) Max PDV - the maximum PDV associated with the PDV percentile


Clark, Pendleton, Kumar   Expires January 8, 2006               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     RTCP XR - New Parameter Extensions          July 2005

    (iii)PDV Percentile - the percentage of time on the call during 
         which PDV was below Max PDV

    (iv) PDV type - indicates PPDV (0), MAPDV (1), Y.1540 (2)

   For example:-

     (a) To report PPDV (RFC3550):
         Mean PDV = PPDV
         Max PDV = Undefined (FF FF)
         PDV Percentile = Undefined (FF)
         PDV type = 0 PPDV

     (b) To report 95th percentile MAPDV (G.1020):
         Mean PDV = average MAPDV
         Max PDV = Max MAPDV
         PDV Percentile = 95
         PDV type = 1 MAPDV

    Note that implementations may either fix the reported percentile 
    and calculate the associated PDV level OR may fix a threshold PDV 
    level and calculate the associated percentile. 

3.7 Analog Signal Parameters

   The definitions of Signal, Noise and RERL are as described in RFC3611
   however it is permitted to include assumed values if measured values
   are not present.  The Metric Status byte indicates which are measured
   and which are assumed values.

3.8 Metric Status

   Indicates the source of analog parameter values used in call quality 
   calculation:

   Bit      Description        Value = 0       Value = 1     Source

    0   Local signal level       assumed        measured       (a)

    1   Remote signal level      assumed        measured       (b)

    2   Local noise level        assumed        measured       (a)

    3   Remote noise level       assumed        measured       (b)

    4   Local echo level         assumed        measured       (c)

    5   Remote echo level        assumed        measured       (d)

    6,7   Reserved

Internet-Draft     RTCP XR - New Parameter Extensions          July 2005



   (a) Measured on the incoming decoded VoIP stream prior to level 
       shifts applied in the endpoint

   (b) Measured by the remote endpoint for the decoded VoIP stream and 
       reported to this endpoint through RTCP XR or equivalent or 
       measured by this endpoint for the outgoing encoded VoIP stream.

   (c) Measured in the incoming line/ trunk/ handset direction at this 
       endpoint after the effects of echo cancellation

   (d) Measured in the incoming line/ trunk/ handset direction at the 
       remote endpoint after the effects of echo cancellation and 
       reported to this endpoint through RTCP XR or equivalent.


3.9 Call Quality Metrics

   R factor has been split into R-LQ and R-CQ to be consistent with the 
   SIP draft.  Both R and MOS have been extended to 8:8 notation to give 
   higher resolution.  

   External R has been split into R-LQ External In and R-LQ External Out
   however since these are likely to be estimated values 8 bit 
   resolution was maintained.

     R-LQ External In - measured by this endpoint for incoming 
                        connection on "other" side of this endpoint

     R-LQ External Out - copied from RTCP XR message received from 
                      remote endpoint on "other" side of this endpoint

   e.g. PhoneA <---> Bridge <----> Phone B

   In XR message from Bridge to Phone A:-

        - R-LQ = quality for PhoneA ----> Bridge path

        - R-LQ-ExtIn = quality for Bridge <---- PhoneB path

        - R-LQ-ExtOut = quality for Bridge -----> PhoneB path

   This allows PhoneA to assess 

   (i) received quality from the combination of 

       R-LQ measured at A 
             and
       R-LQ-ExtIn reported by the Bridge to A

Internet-Draft     RTCP XR - New Parameter Extensions          July 2005

   (ii) remote endpoint quality from the combination of

       R-LQ reported by the Bridge
             and
       R-LQ-ExtOut reported by the Bridge

3.10 Configuration parameters
   
   These parameters are as defined in RFC3611

3.11 Payload and Media Types

   The RTP Payload type field and an indication of the type of media.

      RTP Payload type - as per RFC3551 and
                http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtp-parameters

      Media type - 
                  0 = No media present
                  1 = Narrowband audio
                  2 = Wideband audio
                  3 = Fax Relay (T.38)
                  4 = Voiceband data (V.152)
                  5 = Modem Relay (V.150.1)
                  6 = Text Relay (V.151)
                  7 = Video

3.12 Extended payload description field

   Field that provides additional payload parameters including sample 
   rate, frames per packet and frame size in octets and milliseconds 
   and can be extended to incorporate a text description of the payload
   type.  For example, the default descriptor length of 2 (words) 
   indicates that the basic parameters are supplied, 3 would indicate 
   that 4 additional bytes of text description are present.... 

3.13 Vendor Extension field

   One or more vendor specific extension blocks may be added.  Each has
   the form Vendor ID, Block Length, Extended Parameters and the block 
   length is defined as including these extension header and extended 
   parameter octets but does not include any subsequent vendor specific
   extension blocks.  This would allow an implementation to skip over a
   vendor specific extension that it did not understand. 

   The Vendor ID is structured as a Country Code (T.35) followed by 
   a Vendor ID:  

    (i) The first octet of the T.35 County Code contains either a 
    country code from Annex A of ITU Recommendation T.35 followed by 
    0x00 or an escape code of 0xFF followed by a country code from 
    Annex B of T.35.

Internet-Draft     RTCP XR - New Parameter Extensions          July 2005

   (ii) For a T.35 Vendor ID the ID is allocated by the country or 
   administration referenced by the Country Code. This field is padded 
   with leading zeros if necessary.

   (iii) The Vendor ID Source field indicates the source of the Vendor
   ID definition.  A value of 1 indicates that the source is a national
   or regional administration recognized by the ITU.  A value of 3 
   indicates that the vendor ID is an IANA enterprise number.

4.1 Header

   The indicated block type is N  The block length indicates the length 
   of this report in 32 bit words and includes any extension octets.

4.2 Correlation tag
   The correlation tag facilitates the correlation of this payload with
   other call or session related data or endpoint data.

4.3 Algorithm description

   The CQ descriptor is a bit field which indicates which algorithm is 
   being described.  The bits are defined as:-

Clark, Pendleton, Kumar   Expires January 8, 2006               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     RTCP XR - New Parameter Extensions          July 2005

      Bit 0:      MOS-LQ Algorithm
      Bit 1:      MOS-CQ Algorithm
      Bit 2:      R-LQ Algorithm
      Bit 3:      R-CQ Algorithm


  The descriptor length gives the overall length of the descriptor in
  32 bit words and includes the CQ descriptor and length fields.

  The CQ algorithm descriptor is a text field that contains the
  description or name of the algorithm.  If the algorithm name is 
  shorter than the length of the field then the trailing octets 
  must be set to 0x00.

   For example, an implementation may report:

      CQ descriptor = 0x0F          - all algorithms
      Descriptor length = 3         - 3 words
      Descriptor = "Alg X" 0x00     - description

4.4 Vendor Extension field

   One or more vendor specific extension blocks may be added.  Each has
   the form Vendor ID, Block Length, Extended Parameters and the block 
   length is defined as including these extension header and extended 
   parameter octets but does not include any subsequent vendor specific
   extension blocks.  This would allow an implementation to skip over a
   vendor specific extension that it did not understand. 

   The Vendor ID is structured as Country Code (T.35) followed by Vendor
   ID:  

    (i) The first octet of the T.35 County Code contains either a 
    country code from Annex A of ITU Recommendation T.35 followed by 
    0x00 or an escape code of 0xFF followed by a country code from 
    Annex B of T.35. 

   (ii) For a T.35 Vendor ID the ID is allocated by the country or 
   administration referenced by the Country Code. This field is padded 
   with leading zeros if necessary.  [Add IANA reference]

   (iii) The Vendor ID Source field indicates the source of the Vendor
   ID definition.  A value of 1 indicates that the source is a national
   or regional administration recognized by the ITU.  A value of 3 
   indicates that the vendor ID is an IANA enterprise number.

7. IANA Considerations

8.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing to
   obtain this information should be properly authenticated and the
   information transferred securely.
