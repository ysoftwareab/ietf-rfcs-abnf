ABSTRACT

  The LDAPv3 protocol (as specified in [1]) is designed to be a
  lightweight access protocol for directory services supporting X.500
  models. In addition, in an Internet context, many of the names about
  which users seek information are Internet email addresses. A native
  LDAP based directory service for the Internet should make it
  convenient to process such names -- there is a huge social investment

  Internet-Draft         Locating LDAP Servers                 03/26/97


  spanning two decades to get to the point where names like
  "john.doe@somewhere.com" can appear in newspaper articles, TV
  commercials, and on billboards and millions of people understand what
  do with them.

  This draft defines a very simple convention for  looking up
  information associated with people identified by Internet email
  addresses - really nothing more than identifying an existing
  capability of LDAP, in the hopes that the convention can become
  widespread.

1.    Introduction

  We are interested in scenarios such as the following:

  · What is the name (telephone number, postal address, etc.) of the
     person whose email address is "john.doe@somecorp.com"?

  · What is the name of the calendar server holding free/busy time
     information for the person whose email address is
     "john.doe@somecorp.com"?


2.    Specification

  We show how, given a person's RFC822 [4] email address and an LDAP
  attribute, to construct an LDAP URL [3] to fetch that attribute. We
  make use of the work by Kille and Wahl [2] to convert the domain name
  in the email address to an X.500 DN, which forms the root of a deep
  search for an entry with the given email address.

   Let "attr" be the attribute (telephone number, postal address,
  calendar server, etc.) that it is desired to obtain, and
  "person@domain " be the RFC822 email address of the person. Suppose
  the translation of "domain" into an X.500 DN according to [2] is

  "DC=x,DC=y". Then the canonical LDAP URL to fetch the attribute is
  "ldap://domain/DC=s,DC=y?attr?sub?mail=person@domain".

  What the above URL does is specify (via the "sub" keyword) a search
  of  the entire subtree of the directory for the person's domain for
  an entry whose value for the "mail" attribute is the person's email
  address, requesting the return of the value of the specified
  attribute.

  A note on the attribute name "mail". In [5],  we have

     ( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3 NAME 'mail' EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
     SUBSTRINGS caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch SYNTAX 'IA5String{256}' )

  and from RFC 1274 [6] we have

     rfc822Mailbox ATTRIBUTE
      WITH ATTRIBUTE-SYNTAX
       caseIgnoreIA5StringSyntax
         (SIZE (1 .. ub-rfc822-mailbox))
          ::= {pilotAttributeType 3}

  and

     data OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {ccitt 9}
     pss OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {data 2342}
     ucl OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {pss 19200300}
     pilot OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {ucl 100}
     pilotAttributeType OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {pilot 1}

  I.e., pilotAttributeType is {pilot 1} is 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1 so
  {pilotAttributeType 3} is 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3 so the OID for
  'mail' is the same as for rfc822Mailbox. It would have been more
  obvious if [5] had used the symbolic attribute names from RFC 1274
  instead of the raw OIDs.


3.    Security Considerations

  Putting attributes associated with people in directories accessible
  from over the Internet must be done with due care for maintaining the
  privacy of the information. LDAPv3 permits, but does not require,
  strong authentication and privacy protocols  to be used to access the
  directory. Unless these are in use, it is advisable that only public
  information should be put in a directory accessible to the Internet.
