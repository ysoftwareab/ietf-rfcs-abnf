   management of the Border Gateway Protocol Version 4 (BGP4).

   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Border Gateway Protocol Version 4.

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major compo-
   nents:

     o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

     o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for
          the purpose of management. The first version of this Structure
          of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described
          in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215
          [4]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58,
          RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

     o    Message protocols for transferring management information. The
          first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1
          and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the
          SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
          track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
          [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the message proto-
          col is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572
          [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

     o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
          first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
          described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
          operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
          [13].

     o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14]

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.



2.  Objectives

   This MIB Module is meant to broadly update and replace a prior MIB
   Module defined in RFC 1657 [12].  Additionally, there is another
   effort underway to address very specific limited objectives in updat-
   ing points in the RFC 1657 object definition and managed object
   attributes [13].  The MIB Module described herein is intended to
   fully serve the functions and scope of RFC 1657 and these RFC 1657
   updates.


2.1.  Protocol Extensions

   Additionally, however, there are a number of ways in which the BGP
   Protocol has been enhanced through its ability for added capabili-
   ties. Implementations of those capabilities have not been able to
   have any management capabilities present in RFC 1657-compliant MIB
   module agents, since the capabilities themselves postdated the adop-
   tion of RFC 1657.  For several significant capabilities, in the form
   of BGP Communities [17], Autonomous System Confederation [16] , BGP
   Multiprotocol Extensions [18], and Route Reflection [19], the MIB
   Module defined in this document exposes object types to manage those
   extended capabilities and their operation.

   One of these extensions in particular (the multiprotocol extensions)
   requires a thorough redefinition of MIB table row indices from the
   RFC 1657 state.  This allows transport-independent address indices
   consistent with the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and Subsequent
   Address Family Identifier (SAFI) mechanisms of that extension.


2.2.  Mechanisms for MIB Extensibility

   Moreover, the requirement for the incremental update of support for
   capabilities such as these begs the issue of placing modular extensi-
   bility for protocol extensions within the framework of the MIB
   itself.  Going forward, it would be very desirable to have attributes
   of the MIB structure, and administrative procedures, to allow the
   incremental update of the MIB scope to cover any such new protocol
   extensions, without requiring a reissue of the entire MIB.  In this
   sense, we seek to structure the MIB much like the underlying BGP4
   itself, allowing capability-by-capability update.

2.3.  BGP Configuration

   Finally, the definition and adoption of Version 3 of the SNMP has
   occurred since the adoption of the RFC 1657 MIB.  As a result, the
   ability to deploy secure configuration of managed elements via SNMP
   in a standardized way has become a reality for managed networks.  In
   this MIB definition effort, we seek to expose a more thorough capac-
   ity for configuration of BGP4 and its capabilities than was present
   in RFC 1657 or than was common practice at the time of its adoption.


3.  MIB Organization

   The MIB is broken down into several top level sections.  This sec-
   tionalization is important to create an organization for extensibil-
   ity.

   In general, a top level section of the MIB module will identify some
   number of "core" scalar and tabular objects rooted off of it.  If
   there is sufficient depth within a subsection of one of these top-
   level sections, the "core" subdivision off of the top level section
   may provide multiple levels to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER scope necessary
   to define its management data.

   Once this core section is defined, however, each top-level section
   has an explicit provision for an 'extensions' section OBJECT IDENTI-
   FIER.  The intent of the extensions section is to be containment for
   discrete per-extension sections.  By 'extension' here, we refer to
   protocol mechanisms, capabilities, and exchanges which are not
   defined in the base Border Gateway Protocol definition, or is not
   configuration for protocol operations of similarly 'core' status.
   Currently, we propose keying the identification within the per-exten-
   sion section in one of two ways.

   Where the extension is keyed to a defined capability which has an
   associated BGP capability number assigned by IANA (for example, mul-
   tiprotocol BGP extensions), the per extension section will be that
   defined IANA capability number.  Where the extension has management
   information suitable for a MIB extension but does not correspond to
   an exchanged protocol capability (for example, BGP Route Reflection),
   the extension section shall have its final OBJECT IDENTIFIER fragment
   correspond to the RFC number which first uniquely defined the exten-
   sion (i.e., not requiring renumbering at the time a defining RFC for
   a protocol mechanism is outdated by a later RFC).

3.1.  bgpM2BaseScalars

   The bgpM2BaseScalars section (and corresponding OBJECT IDENTIFIER) is
   used to delineate object types used for basic management and monitor-
   ing of the protocol implementation.   These are core parameters for
   the local configuration.  While notifications are designed to be
   extensible into any other section in the MIB module, the currently
   defined traps are located here, in a subsection 'bgpM2BaseNotifica-
   tions'.  This is rooted at index level zero (0) here, owing to con-
   ventions established in [4].

   Support for multiple concurrently supported versions of BGP is
   exposed through the entries of the bgpM2VersionTable.  Similarly,
   support for multiple capabilities and authentication mechanisms, as
   identified by their assigned numbers, are reported in the bgpM2Sup-
   portedCapabilitiesTable and bgpM2SupportedAuthTable respectively.

   In the MIB document, there are currently scalar extension mechanisms
   to allow the agent to report membership of a local BGP Confederation
   [21] or Route Reflection Cluster ID [24], as well as whether these
   capabilities are in fact supported by the implementation.  These are
   consistent with the non-capability based extension section indexing
   guidelines as presented above.

   bgpM2BaseScalars also is the root for a subsection, bgpM2BaseScalar-
   Configuration, which contains the companion configuration objects for
   the base scalar objects delineated in the preceding paragraphs.
   These are presented as a series of scalar read-write objects, with a
   single OBJECT-TYPE of syntax StorageType to designate the persistence
   of the instance value data for these configuration scalars.


3.2.  bgpM2PeerData

   The bgpM2PeerData section is per-peer object type definitions. The
   predominant table of read-only STATUS object types in that section
   (bgpM2PeerTable) describes the session, negotiation state, and
   authentication state on a per peer basis.  A second table (bgpM2Pre-
   fixCountersTable) exposes information about individual route prefixes
   received over each peer session.  A separate subsection and its sub-
   ordinate table (bgpM2PeerErrorsTable) reports information about the
   last error encountered on a given peering session.

   Further subsections report authentication state with the peer, peer-
   ing session detected errors,  and elapsed time it has taken to
   advance the peering session into various states defined in the proto-
   col FSM.

Internet Draft                 BGP-MIB v2               November 4, 2002


   The bgpM2PeerConfiguredTimersTable reports and allows dynamic reset
   of key timers on the peer session.  These currently allow reset of
   hold time and keepalive timer, for compatibility with the same capa-
   bilities in RFC 1657 [17]. For these resettable timers, their end-to-
   end negotiated current values are reflected in the bgpM2PeerNegotiat-
   edTimersTable.

   As currently defined, these tables describing authentication, error
   state, and timer values (in addition to the configuration tables for
   session timers) are tightly coupled enough to the logical per-row
   view exposed in the bgpM2PeerTable row entries on a session that
   these subordinate "tables" are defined as AUGMENTing the
   bgpM2PeerTable itself.  The other primary design criterion behind
   this decision is that using this AUGMENTation does not increase the
   per-row-data requirements of bgpM2PeerTable instance retrieval so as
   to make such per-row retrieval unwieldy for the management applica-
   tion.


3.2.1.  bgpM2PeerCapabilities

   bgpM2PeerCapabilitiesData has objects and tables to describe BGP
   capabilities locally supported, and those reported and negotiated
   over each peer session.   For tables supporting each of these capa-
   bility sets, capability code and data value are provided.  Attention
   must be given to the fact that multiple instances of a given capabil-
   ity can be transmitted between BGP speakers.


3.2.2.  bgpM2PeerCounters

   The bgpM2CountersTable and bgpM2PrefixCountersTable report protocol
   exchanges/FSM transitions, and discrete number of NLRIs exchanged per
   peering session, respectively.  This is independent of actual
   exchanged path attributes, which are tabularized later in the MIB
   module.  Note that session transitions as reflected in changes of
   instances within this table may also be reflected in issuance of
   bgpM2Established and bgpM2BackwardTransition NOTIFICATION-TYPE PDUs.

3.2.3.  Peering Data Extensions

   Route reflector status on a per-peer basis (whether the peer is a
   client or nonClient of  the local BGP router's reflected route propa-
   gation), and peer confederation membership is reported in non capa-
   bility extensions of the peering data section.

3.2.4.  Configuring Peering Sessions


   The MIB has several tables indexed on a per-peer level of granularity
   to control creation and activation of new peering sessions, and to
   allow control on running sessions (those reflected in bgpM2PeerTable
   row instances) regardless of what caused their creation in the BGP
   routing process.

   The bgpM2CfgPeerAdminStatusTable allows creation and specification of
   a row by a bgpM2PeerIndex value (which is how its associated row
   instance is identified in the bgpM2PeerTable).  For each such row
   instance, the set of the bgpM2CfgPeerAdminStatus OBJECT-TYPE of MAX-
   ACCESS read-write can allow management application start and stop of
   the session.

   This is contrasted with the function of the bgpM2CfgPeerTable, and
   its related AUGMENTed tables bgpM2CfgPeerTimersTable and bgpM2Cfg-
   PeerAuthTable.  These are used to facilitate direct creation of peer-
   ing sessions by the management application.  The function of columnar
   OBJECT-TYPEs within the bgpM2CfgPeerTable for local and remote
   address, version negotiation, and various row-administrative
   attributes (RowStatus and StorageType SYNTAXes) are straightforward
   enough.  The only subtlety with respect to how peering sessions are
   activated from usage of this table, and how the activated sessions
   are reflected through their bgpM2PeerTable and bgpM2CfgPeerAdminSta-
   tusTable entries, is in the usage of the bgpM2CfgPeerTable columnar
   object bgpM2CfgPeerStatus.  bgpM2CfgPeerStatus can take on two val-
   ues.  When a peering session, as reflected through its row instance
   in the bgpM2CfgPeerTable, has the bgpM2CfgPeerStatus instance value
   in that row set to running(2) at the time of the SYNTAX RowStatus
   object instance of bgpM2CfgPeerRowEntryStatus set to active(1), the
   peering session will in fact be activated in the BGP routing process
   (in addition to having its row instance created in the bgpM2Cfg-
   PeerTable and bgpM2CfgPeerAdminStatusTable).  In this case, the asso-
   ciated row of the bgpM2CfgPeerAdminStatusTable row bgpM2CfgPeerAdmin-
   Status instance would have the value of start(2).  If, in the prior
   example, the bgpM2CfgPeerStatus is halted(1) at the time of the
   bgpM2CfgPeerRowEntryStatus instance set to active(1), only the peer-
   ing table entries would be created at this time of activation, with-
   out the peering session being automatically started.  The bgpM2Cfg-
   PeerAdminStatusTable row bgpM2CfgPeerAdminStatus instance associated
   with the session would in this case reflect a value of stop(1).

   Since the row entries of the per-peer configuration tables which AUG-
   MENT the bgpM2CfgPeerTable logically fate-share the row instances in
   the bgpM2CfgPeerTable which they are AUGMENTing, they also share the
   same StorageType and RowStatus SYNTAX object sense of the

   bgpM2CfgPeerTable rows which they augment.

3.3.  BGP Routing Information Base Data

   An important table for providing index information for other tables
   in the MIB module is the bgpM2NlriTable.  This discriminates on a
   given network prefix (by AFI/SAFI), and the peer which advertised the
   prefix (since it can be heard of from multiple speakers).  The
   bgpM2PathAttrIndex column which identifies each row in this table is
   used as an index for other per-attribute tables through the remainder
   of the MIB module.

   RFC 3107 [26] specifies a capability for exchanged routes between BGP
   peers to attach attribute information to a route indicating, specifi-
   cally, related MPLS label path information.  The MIB supports the
   presentation of this attribute information by generalizing how these
   attributes are presented to accommodate further extensions of this
   particular type.  Within a given bgpM2NlriTable entry, we speak of
   attribute data of this type as being 'opaque' to BGP, and use the
   columnar OBJECT-TYPEs bgpM2NlriOpaqueType and bgpM2NlriOpaquePointer
   to refer to it.  In the case of the RFC 3107 MPLS label encoding
   (which is the only usage of these columnar fields in the bgpM2NlriTa-
   ble right now), a MPLS label stack would be referenced by bgpM2Nlri-
   OpaquePointer by its per-NLRI instance pointing to a row instance in
   the MPLS LSR MIB mplsLabelStackTable, and the bgpM2NlriOpaqueType
   instance having a value of bgpMplsLabelStack(1).


   The bgpM2AdjRibsOutTable row entries reflect data on routes which
   have been placed, per peering session, in the Adj-Rib-Out for adver-
   tisement to the associated peer.

   The bgpM2PathAttrTable provides discrete BGP NLRI attributes which
   were received with the advertisement of the prefix by its advertising
   peer.  Specific information about the autonomous system path (AS
   Path) advertised with the NLRI, on a per AS value, is to be found in
   the bgpM2AsPathTable.

   Finally, where attributes which were unable to be reported in the
   bgpM2PathAttrTable, the AS Path table, or any defined per-NLRI tables
   in the agent were received with the prefix, those attributes are
   reported via the bgpM2PathAttrUnknownTable.  Short of advertised
   attribute type, no semantic breakdown of the unknown attribute data
   is provided.  That data is only available as a raw OCTET STRING in
   the bgpM2PathAttrUnknownValue column of this table.

3.3.1.  Routing Information Base Extensions

   There are two extension sections and five subordinate tables to the
   bgpM2PathAttrTable and RIB data OBJECT IDENTIFIER-delimited MIB mod-
   ule section. The bgpM2PathAttrRouteReflectionExts and its contained
   bgpM2PathAttrOriginatorIdTable report on the originating route
   reflector.  The bgpM2PathAttrClusterTable specifically reports on the
   reflection route a NLRI has traversed to get to the local BGP routing
   process.

   The bgpM2PathAttrCommunityExts section deals with extended and non-
   extended communities for network routes.  The bgpM2PathAttrCommTable
   bgpM2PathAttrExtCommTable  contained herein report community member-
   ship (if any) on a per network-prefix basis.

3.4.  Consideration On Table Indexing

   There are certain efficiency concerns for row index management for
   management applications which are useful to take into consideration,
   given the nature of some of the tables implied in the preceding sec-
   tion.

   In the first place, it is valuable to exploit the direct relationship
   of entries in, for example, the bgpM2PrefixCountersTable as they
   relate to the entry in the bgpM2PeerTable to which they are related.
   More compelling is the example case of the one-to-many relationship
   between a row entry in the bgpM2PeerTable and the bgpM2PathAttrTable,
   the latter of which maintains per-row entries for potentially many
   NLRIs as received from a peer in a BGP UPDATE message.  From the
   point of view of normalizing these relationships, it would be useful
   to have a direct reference to the "governing" bgpM2PeerTable row
   entry for the peer which is a "dependency" for the subordinate table
   row entry for other peer data.

   Second, the nature of protocol-independent addressing makes the
   indexing of these entries indirectly even more compelling.  Even
   accounting for the addressing requirements of IPv6 and the provision
   of AFI and SAFI qualifiers, the logical addressing of a row in the
   bgpPathAttrClusterTable (for example) would extend out some 50 bytes
   if there was no direct index linkage to the "governing" bgpPathAt-
   trTable, and bgpPeerTable entries.

   For this reason, the tables are structured in such a way that, where
   there is such a linkage to a "dependent" table (where, for example,
   the bgpPrefixCountersTable "depends on" the bgpPeerTable), a table
   will contain a per-row numeric index (e.g., bgpPeerIndex), which the
   "dependent" table will use as one of its own row index values.  These
   indices are manufactured by the agent, and are otherwise opaque to

   the management application (or, for that matter, even to the organi-
   zation of the "dependent" table[s]).

   Where considerations of per-row retrieval overhead (in terms of typi-
   cal row instance data size, as a function of liability to have a sin-
   gle row retrieval exceed PDU size, for example), and those of general
   logical data organization permit, certain tables logically at the
   sub-peering-session level have been specified as AUGMENTing the pri-
   mary tables (bgpM2PeerTable and bgpM2CfgPeerTable) to which those
   sub-peering-session row entries relate.  This is to facilitate ease
   on the part of a management application of assembling (for example,
   via GET-BULK operations across a lexicographically contiguous row
   scope) a management image of control information on a given peering
   session.

             of bgpM2PeerIndex row instance values across rows of
             the bgpM2PeerTable.  It is used to provide an index
             structure for other tables whose data is logically
             per-peer.

             For explicitly configured peers, this value will remain
             consistent until this row is deleted by deleting the
             configured peers.  Unconfigured peers will generate
             a monotonically increasing number when a BGP FSM is
             built to process the peering session.  Values in the
             bgpM2PeerTable and other tables utilizing bgpM2PeerIndex
             are expected to remain in existence for an arbitrary
             time after the unconfigured peer has been deleted
             in order to allow management applications to extract
             useful management information for those peers.  Thus,

2.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module contains controls which relate to core services for
   interdomain routing using the Border Gateway Protocol.  In particu-
   lar, this MIB allows configuration of operational elements for those
   services.  If such configuration is done without consideration for
   the effects of such configuration activity, or malicious configura-
   tion activity is allowed on the managed elements, the effect could be
   denial of service to the processes and end users in the affected
   domain(s).

   SNMPv1 is not considered a sufficiently secure environment for the
   deployment of such configuration ability.  Even if the management
   data path is secure at the network protocol layer (by the deployment
   of secure IP, for example), there are still points of exposure around
   such issues as to what operators and applications are allowed to

   access and modify the configuration as exposed through this MIB mod-
   ule.

   It is strongly recommended that the agent implementor considers the
   security features afforded by the SNMP Version 3 framework in expos-
   ing the configuration features of this MIB module.  In particular,
   the availability and usage of the User-based Security Model [12]

5.  Changes From Last Version

   This section is used to track changes from version to version of this
   document.  This section will be removed from the document prior to
   being issued to IDR working group last call.

     *    Changes from draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-mibv2-02.txt to draft-ietf-
          idr-bgp4-mibv2-03.txt (4 November 2002):

          Changed the order of the bgpM2NlriPrefixLen and
          bgpM2NlriPrefix objects and renumbered them.  This was to make
          it consistant with user expectations.

          Clarify the peer table description text to specify the remote
          peer.

          Use SnmpAdminString instead of DisplayString.

          Correct TEXTUAL CONVENTION for extended communities.

          Changed enumerations of bgpM2PathATtrAtomicAggregate.

          Added link local table for RFC 2545 nexthops.

     *    Changes from draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-mibv2-01.txt to draft-ietf-
          idr-bgp4-mibv2-02.txt (28 February 2002)

          Lots of changes in this rewrite, these are the most dramatic:

          Configuration objects and tables added.

          All references to 'bgp' in object descriptors changed to
          'bgpM2' to disambiguate from RFC 1657 and its OBSOLETing MIB.

          Community Textual conventions added to beginning of MIB.

          bgpM2CalcLength and PathString columns added to bgpM2PathAttr
          table.

          Creation of separate bgpM2AdjRibsOutTable.

          Appearance of NLRI table notions such as 'opaque type'.

          Overhaul of specification of AS Path types to accommodate eas-
          ier management at time of route aggregation.
