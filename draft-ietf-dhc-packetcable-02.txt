   2.   Abstract 
    
   This document defines a DHCP option that will be used to configure 
   various devices deployed within CableLabs architectures.  
   Specifically, the document describes DHCP option content that will be 
   used to configure one class of CableLabs client device: a PacketCable 
   Media Terminal Adapter (MTA).  It is expected that the option content 
   defined within this document will be extended as future CableLabs 
   client devices are developed.

   6.   Introduction  
        
   Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (CableLabs) is a non-profit 
   research and development consortium that serves the cable television 
   industry via design and specification of new and emerging broadband 
   service architectures. Several CableLabs initiatives define DHCP 
   clients that have specific DHCP configuration requirements.  One such 
   initiative is the PacketCable project. 
    
   The PacketCable project is aimed at architecting, qualifying, and 
   supporting Internet-based multimedia services over cable-based packet 
   networks. These new multimedia services will include telephony and 
   videoconferencing, delivered using the basic Internet Protocol (IP) 
   technology that is used to send data via the Internet.

   PacketCable 1.0 provides Voice over IP (VoIP) service delivery. The 
   VoIP service is supported at the customer site by two key components:  
   a Cable Modem (CM) and a Media Terminal Adapter (MTA).  The CM 
   converts the cable RF signals to/from various IP voice protocols, 
   while the MTA converts the VoIP protocols into analog telephony 
   compatible with a common telephone. 
    
   The CM and MTA may be packaged together or separately.  If packaged 
   together, the unit is referred to as an Embedded-MTA (EMTA - depicted 
   in Figure 1). If packaged separately, the MTA is referred to as a 
   Standalone MTA (SMTA).

                     Figure 1. PacketCable 1.0 Embedded-MTA  
                                                 
   The CM and MTA are distinct IP devices: each has its own MAC address 
   and IP configuration. The CM and MTA utilize the DHCP protocol to 
   obtain IP configuration. It is assumed that the CM and MTA may be 
   administered by different business entities.  The CM communicates 
   with and is configured by the data access provider's DHCP servers.  
   Likewise, the MTA communicates with and is configured by the 
   Telephony Service Provider's (TSP's) DHCP servers. 
    
   The PacketCable architecture requires that the business entity 
   controlling configuration of the CM also determines which business 
   entities control the configuration of the MTA.  This is similar to 
   the example found in the PSTN system: individuals can pick their long 
   distance carriers even though the ultimate control of their telephone 
   remains with the local carrier.  
    
   Due to specific needs of the MTA configuration process (described in 
   [7]), a new CableLabs Client Configuration (CCC) option is needed for 
   the DHCP protocol.  Both CM and MTA DHCP clients will request this 
   option.  When requested, both the CM and TSP DHCP servers will 
   populate this option into DHCP responses. 
    
   It should be noted that, although the CCC option will be initially 
   deployed to support PacketCable VOIP applications, the CCC option 
   will also be used to support various non VOIP applications. Use of 
   the CCC option does not necessarily mean that the service provider is 
   a TSP.

   7.   CableLabs Client Configuration Option Format 
        
   The option begins with a tag octet containing the option code (code 
   TBD). A length octet follows the tag octet.  The value of the length 
   octet does not include itself or the tag octet. The length octet is 
   followed by "length" octets of sub-option content (total length, not 
   sub-option count).  The option layout is depicted below:  
     
      +------+--------+--------------+--------------+---+--------------+  
      | Code | Length | Sub-option 1 | Sub-option 2 |...| Sub-option n |

   A sub-option begins with a tag octet containing the sub-option code. 
   A length octet follows the tag octet.  The value of the length octet 
   does not include itself or the tag octet. The length octet is 
   followed by "length" octets of sub-option information.  The sub-
   option layout is depicted below:

   8.   CableLabs Client Configuration Option: Sub-Option Definitions  
        
   The following sections provide detailed descriptions of each sub-
   option. There are a few general formatting rules: 
    
   - Several sub-options permit specification of a port number. When 
     specified, port numbers MUST be encoded as 16 bit unsigned 
     integers in network byte order. If omitted, standard protocol port 
     numbers, as defined in [4], are assumed. 
   - FQDN's MUST be encoded per RFC 1035 section 3.1. Note that a 
     terminating 0 is required. 
   - IPv4 addresses MUST be encoded as 4 binary octets in network byte-
     order. 
   - All multi-octet quantities MUST be encoded per network byte-
     ordering (high-order byte first). 
    
   8.1. TSP's DHCP Server Address Sub-Options 
        
   The TSP DHCP Server Address sub-options identify the DHCP servers 
   that will be used by an MTA to obtain IP configuration.   
        
   Sub-option 1 is the address of the TSP's primary DHCP server. Sub-
   option 2 is the address of the TSP's secondary DHCP server. Both sub-
   options 1 and 2 MAY specify a DHCP server port number. 
      
   The encoding syntax for sub-options 1/2 takes on two forms depending 
   on whether a port number is included or not. 
    
   1. IPv4 address using default port. The sub-option length MUST be 4 
   and the sub-option MUST include the DHCP server's IPv4 address as 
   follows:   
    
        Code  Len          Address 
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  
      | 1/2 |  4  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |    
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  
        
   The default DHCP port number is assumed. 
    
   2. IPv4 address with a specific port. The sub-option length MUST be 
   6.  The sub-option MUST include and DHCP server's IPv4 address and 
   port number as follows:  
    
       Code   Len          Address             Port 
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+-----+  
      | 1/2 |  6  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |  p1  |  p2 |    
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+-----+  
        
                                         
   8.2. TSP's SNMP Entity Address Sub-Option

   This option contains the address of the TSP's network SNMP Entity. 
   MTAs communicate with the SNMP entity at various stages in their 
   provisioning process.  For complete details of this provisioning 
   process, see [7].   
        
   The address can be configured as either an IPv4 address with optional 
   port number or as an FQDN with optional port number.  The encoding of 
   sub-option 3 will adhere to one of 4 formats. 
        
   1. IPv4 address using the default port.  The sub-option length MUST 
   be 5.  The length octet MUST be followed by a single octet that 
   indicates the specific address type that follows.  This type octet 
   MUST be set to 0 to indicate an IPv4 address.  The type octet MUST be 
   followed by 4 octets of IPv4 address:   
    
    
       Code   Len   Type        Address 
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  
      |  3  |  5  |  0  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |    
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  
    
        
   2. IPv4 address using a specific port.  The sub-option length MUST be 
   7. The length octet MUST be followed by a single octet that indicates 
   the specific address type that follows.  This type octet MUST be set 
   to 0 to indicate an IPv4 address.  The type octet MUST be followed by 
   4 octets of IPv4 address.  A port number MUST follow the IPv4 
   address: 
        
       Code   Len   Type         Address            Port 
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  
      |  3  |  7  |  0  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |  p1 |  p2 |    
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  
    
        
   3. FQDN using the default port.  The length octet MUST be followed by 
   a single octet that indicates the specific address type that follows.  
   This type octet MUST be set to 1 to indicate an FQDN.  The type octet 
   MUST be followed by the encoded FQDN: 
    
       Code   Len   Type            FQDN 
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+   +-----+ 
      |  3  | n+1 |  1  |  f1 |  f2 |...|  fn | 
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+   +-----+ 
        
   4. FQDN with specific port. The length octet MUST be followed by a 
   single octet that indicates the specific address type that follows.  
   This type octet MUST be set to 1 to indicate an FQDN.  The type octet 
   MUST be followed by the encoded FQDN.  A port number MUST follow the 
   FQDN:

   8.3. TSP's Domain Name Server Address Sub-Options 
        
   The TSP's DNS servers resolve PacketCable FQDN's into an IPv4 
   addresses.  The MTA requires DNS capability. 
        
   Sub-option 4 is the address of the TSP's primary DNS server. Sub-
   option 5 is the address of the TSP's secondary DNS server.  Sub-
   option 5 MAY be specified to identify a redundant or backup DHCP 
   server. Both sub-options 4 and 5 MAY specify a DNS server port 
   number. 
    
   The encoding syntax for sub-options 4/5 takes on two forms depending 
   on whether a port number is included or not. 
    
   1. IPv4 address using default port. The sub-option length MUST be 4 
   and the sub-option MUST include the DNS server's IPv4 address as 
   follows:   
    
        Code  Len          Address 
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  
      | 4/5 |  4  |  a1 |  a1 |  a3 |  a4 |    
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  
        
   The default DNS port number is assumed. 
    
   2. IPv4 address using a specific port. The sub-option length MUST be 
   6.  The sub-option MUST include and DNS server's IPv4 address and 
   port number as follows:  
    
       Code   Len          Address             Port 
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+-----+  
      | 4/5 |  6  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |  p1  |  p2 |    
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+-----+  
        
      
   8.4. TSP's Kerberos Realm Name Sub-Option  
        
   The PacketCable architecture requires an MTA to authenticate itself 
   to the TSP's network via the Kerberos protocol.  A Kerberos Realm 
   name is required at the MTA to permit a DNS lookup for the address of 
   the TSP's Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) entity.  
            
   The Kerberos Realm name is an FQDN.  The sub-option is encoded as 
   follows:

       Code   Len   Kerberos Realm Name     
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+   +-----+ 
      |  6  |  n  |  k1 |  k2 |...|  kn | 
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+   +-----+ 
       
      
   8.5. TSP's Ticket Granting Server Utilization Sub-Option 
    
   This sub-option encodes a boolean value which indicates whether an 
   MTA should or should not utilize a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) when 
   obtaining a service ticket for one of the PacketCable application 
   servers. The encoding is as follows:  
    
       Code   Len   Value  
      +-----+-----+-----+  
      |  7  |  1  | 1/0 |  
      +-----+-----+-----+  
    
   The length MUST be 1.  The last octet contains a Boolean value which 
   MUST be either 0 or 1.  A value of 1 MUST be interpreted as true.  A 
   value of 0 MUST be interpreted as false.  
        
    
   8.6. TSP's Provisioning Timer Sub-Option 
        
   The provisioning timer defines the maximum time allowed for the MTA 
   provisioning process to complete. If this timer expires before the 
   MTA has completed the provisioning process, the MTA should reset the 
   timer and re-start its provisioning process from the beginning.  
        
   The sub-option length MUST be 1 and a value between 1 and 30 
   (minutes, inclusive) MUST be used. If any other value is specified, 
   the MTA MUST treat the sub-option as non-populated.  
    
       Code   Len    Value

   8.7. TSP's AS-REQ/AS-REP Backoff and Retry 
    
   This sub-option configures an MTA's Kerberos AS-REQ/AS_REP timeout, 
   backoff, and retry mechanism. 
    
   The encoding of this sub-option is depicted below: 
    
      Code Len   Nom Timeout     Max Timeout     Max Retries 
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
      |10 |12 |n1 |n2 |n3 |n4 |m1 |m2 |m3 |m4 |r1 |r2 |r3 |r4 | 
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
    
   The length octet of this sub-option MUST contain the value 12.

   The length octet MUST be followed by 4 octets containing the AS-
   REQ/AS-REP nominal (initial) timeout value.  This value is a 32 bit 
   unsigned quantity, in units of seconds, encoded per network byte 
   ordering rules. 
    
   The next 4 octets MUST contain the AS-REQ/AS-REP maximum timeout 
   value.  This value is a 32 bit unsigned quantity, in units of 
   seconds, encoded per network byte ordering rules. 
    
   The final 4 octets MUST contain the AS-REQ/AS-REP maximum retry 
   count.  This value is a 32 bit unsigned quantity encoded per network 
   byte ordering rules. 
    
    
   8.8. TSP's AP-REQ/AP-REP Backoff and Retry                 
    
   This sub-option configures an MTA's Kerberos AP-REQ/AP_REP timeout, 
   backoff, and retry mechanism.

   9.   Typical use of the CableLabs Client Configuration Option  
    
   Specific usage of the CableLabs Client Configuration option is 
   described in [7].     
            
   10.  IANA Considerations 
 
   IANA has assigned a value of TBD for the DHCP option code described 
   in this document.

   11.  Legacy Use Information  
        
   The CableLabs Client Configuration option initially used the site-
   specific option value of 177 (0xB1). The use of the site-specific 
   option is to be deprecated when IANA issues an official option 
   number.  
            
   12.  Procedure for Adding Additional Sub-options  
        
   IANA is requested to maintain a new number space of "CableLabs 
   Client Configuration Sub-options", located in the BOOTP-DHCP 
   Parameters Registry.  The initial sub-option codes are described in 
   sections of this document. 
    
   IANA is requested to register codes for future CableLabs Client 
   Configuration Sub-options with an "Expert Review" approval policy as 
   described in RFC 2434 [3]. Future proposed sub-options will be 
   assigned a numeric code chosen by CableLabs, which will be 
   documented in the Internet Drafts that describe the sub-options. The 
   code assignment will be reviewed by a designated expert from the 
   IETF prior to publication in an RFC. 
 
           
   13.  Security Considerations  
        
   This draft relies on the DHCP protocol [5] for authentication and 
   security, i.e. it does not provide in excess of what DHCP is (or will 
   be) providing. It does not expose any security threats beyond what is 
   currently exposed by other DHCP options.
