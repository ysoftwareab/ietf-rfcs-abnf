Abstract

   This document describes the Abstract Service Type for removable
   networked storage media.  These include CD-ROMs, DVDs, DAT tapes,
   optical disks and other media types.  Through the use of this
   template and the Service Location Procotocol [1] networked
   removable storage devices can advertise the currently available
   media and client systems can discover them.

Internet Draft       Networked Removable Storage Media      23 June 1999


1. Introduction

  It is increasingly common to find networked storage devices which
  are available using a range of access protocols.  One common class
  of storage devices allow removable storage (such as CD-ROMs, tapes
  and optical disks) to be made available to the network simply by
  inserting the media to the networked storage device.  

  This presents a problem:  How are clients to discover which media
  is currently available, or becomes avaiLable over time?  By using
  SLP [1] and advertising the attributes of the removable storage
  media, the data on the storage media becomes accessible without
  any prior client configuration.

  Abstract Service templates are defined in [2].


2. Definitions

  This document defines the Networked Removable Storage Media abstract
  service type and two concrete types for the CIFS and NCP file sharing
  protocols.

2.1. CIFS

  The Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol [3] is based on the
  standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol widely in use by
  personal computers and workstations running a wide variety of
  operating systems.

2.2. NCP

  The NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) is one of the core protocols of the
  NetWare (TM) operating system. No known public specification of this
  protocol exists. Clients with access to a NCP client implementation
  may still use the information available in a Networked Removable
  Storage Media service: URL of the NCP concrete type to access the
  media.
  
2.3. UNC

  Networked Removable Storage Media service: URLs of the CIFS or NCP
  concrete type uses a Uniform Naming Convention (UNC) [3] path string
  as part of the url-path to describe the network path to the media.
  Client implementations of the CIFS and NCP protocols usually accepts
  UNC path strings for accessing shared network storage resources.

3. Networked Removable Storage Media Service Template

                      Kent Lidstrom <Kent.Lidstrom@axis.com>

  Language of service template: en

  Security Considerations:
    The attributes included in the template, especially those concerning
    access control, are to be used to provide clients with configuration
    information regarding server features, not security per se.
    Authentication of and access control must be performed by the data
    access protocols themselves.

  Template Text:
  -------------------------template begins here-----------------------
  template-type = nrsm

  template-version = 0.0

  template-description =
    This is an abstract service type defining Networked Removable
    Storage Media.

  template-url-syntax =
    url-path =          ;  Depends on the concrete service type.
                        ;  See these templates.

  media-name = STRING
  ; This is the human readable name for this media. The name may be
  ; given by the media itself or user defined.

  capacity = INTEGER 0
  ; This is the memory capacity of the storage media, in units of
  ; kilobyte.

  writeable = BOOLEAN
  ; If this is TRUE, then the media is read/write.  If it is FALSE
  ; the media is read-only.  Note that stating that media is read/
  ; write does not indicate that *anyone* may write to it.  Access
  ; control may be in place preventing unauthorized writing to the
  ; media.

  media-type = STRING L
  ; This is the media type of the removable media.  This can take
  ; one of the following values:
  ;
  ;   CDROM       The removable media is a CD with data content.
  ;   DVD         The media is a DVD.
  ;   JAZ         The media is a JAZ diskette.
  ;   DAT         The media is a DAT tape.
  ;   OPTICAL     The media is an optical disk.
  ;   TAPE        The media is a tape.
  CDROM,DVD,JAZ,DAT,OPTICAL,TAPE

  volume-description = STRING
  ; This string describes the contents of the removable storage
  ; media.  This string will be supplied to users in user interfaces
  ; to provide them with information to determine whether this 
  ; particular storage media is of interest.

  access-control = BOOLEAN O
  ; This indicates that access control is being used to limit the
  ; availability of the storage media.  No attempt is made to define
  ; *what* access control is in place if the value of this attribute
  ; is TRUE.

  used-space=INTEGER O
  ; The amount of used space of the storage media,
  ; in units of kilobytes.

  file-system = STRING O
  ; The file system present on the networked storage media.  For
  ; example "ISO 9660 with Rock Ridge Extensions"

  worm = BOOLEAN O
  ; If this is TRUE, the media supports Write Once Read Many:  Thus
  ; data can be appended but not deleted or altered on the media.

  contact-person = STRING O
  ; The name of a contact person who is the operator of the removable
  ; storage media device.  This is the person to contact to
  ; unload or load particular media if the storage device if is in a
  ; remote location.  It is suggested that this string include
  ; information that would enable other humans to reach the contact
  ; person, such as a phone number or an email address.

  location = STRING O
  ; The physical location of the removable storage media device.
  ; This should be a descriptive human readable text.

4. Security Considerations

  The attributes included in the nrsm service template, especially those
  concerning access control, are to be used to provide clients with
  configuration information regarding server features, not security per
  se.  Authentication of and access control must be performed by the
  data access protocols themselves.

  SLP [1] provides authentication features which allow clients to verify
  the authenticity of URLs and service attributes.  If the attributes
  present in this service template are obtained in a different manner
  (than SLP) they may be supplied by a malicious source attempting to
  misdirect clients or hide available resources.
