Abstract

   This document depreciates RC4 in Secure Shell (SSH).  Therefore, this
   document updates RFC 4253, and formally obsoletes and moves to
   Historic RFC 4345.

1. Introduction

   RC4 is extremely weak [RFC6649] [RFC7457] [RFC7465] and this document
   depreciates its use in all IETF protocols, including Kerberos and
   Secure Shell (SSH).  The reasons for obsoleting RFC 4345 are
   discussed in Section 2.  The updates to RFC 4253 and the reasons for
   doing them are specified in Section 3.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119, RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2. Why obsolete and move to Historic RFC 4345

   RFC 4345 defines the "arcfour-128" and "arcfour-256" modes for Secure
   Shell (SSH), and is obsoleted and moved to Historic as RC4 is
   extremely weak [RFC6649, RFC7457] and there is research that is at
   least 5 years old that totally breaks all practical usage of
   RC4 [RFC6649].

3. Updates to RFC 4253

   RFC 4253 is updated to note the depreciation of arcfour.

   The last sentence of the paragraph on RC4 (called "arcfour"
   in [RFC4253]) in Section 6.3 of [RFC4253] should read: "Arcfour (and
   RC4) are extremely weak [RFC7457] and therefore it MUST NOT be used."

   An informative reference to RFC 7457 is to be added to [RFC4253].

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA may need to take action as the status for RC4 and 3DES
   algorithms for Secure Shell (SSH) is changed by this document
   (see Section 3, that updates [RFC4253]).

5. Security Considerations

   This document depreciates RC4, that is obsolete cryptography, and
   several attacks that render it useless have been published
   published [RFC6649] [RFC7457] [RFC7465].

6. Acknowledgements

   Thanks to the numerous authors which have shown the weaknesses of
   RC4 throughout the years.
