      A Global Mobility Management Protocol is a mobility protocol used
      by the mobile node to change the global, end-to-end routing of
      packets for purposes of maintaining session continuity when
      movement causes a topology change, thus invalidating a global
      unicast address of the mobile node.  This protocol could be Mobile
      IP [7], [8], but it could also be HIP [9] or MOBIKE [10].

   o  HIP Host Identity Protocol

   o  HMIP Hierarchical Mobile IP

   o  IANA Internet Assigned Numbers Authority

   o  ICMP Internet Control Message Protocol

   o  IEEE Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

   o  IGP Interior Gateway Protocol

   o  IKEv2 Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2

   o  IMSI International Mobile Subscriber Identity

   o  Intra-Link Mobility [1]

      Intra-Link Mobility is mobility between wireless access points
      within a link.  Typically, this kind of mobility only involves
      Layer 2 mechanisms, so Intra-Link Mobility is often called Layer 2
      mobility.  No IP subnet configuration is required upon movement
      since the link does not change, but some IP signaling may be
      required for the mobile node to confirm whether or not the change
      of wireless access point also resulted in the previous access
      routers becoming unreachable.  If the link is served by a single
      access point/router combination, then this type of mobility is
      typically absent.  See Figure 1.

            Figure 1.  Scope of Local and Global Mobility Management

      Figure 1 depicts the scope of local mobility in comparison to
      global mobility.  The Access Network Gateways (ANGs), GA1 and GB1,
      are gateways to their access networks.  The Access Routers (ARs),
      RA1 and RA2, are in access network A; RB1 is in access network B.
      Note that it is possible to have additional aggregation routers
      between ANG GA1 and ANG GB1, and the access routers if the access
      network is large.  Access Points (APs) PA1 through PA3 are in
      access network A; PB1 and PB2 are in access network B. Other ANGs,
      ARs, and APs are also possible, and other routers can separate the
      ARs from the ANGs.  Mobility between two APs under the same AR
      constitutes intra-link (or Layer 2) mobility, and is typically
      handled by Layer 2 mobility protocols (if there is only one AP/
      cell per AR, then intra-link mobility may be lacking).

   o  IPCP6 Internet Protocol Control Protocol for IPv6

   o  IPsec IP security

   o  IPv4 IP version 4

   o  IPv4 Local Mobility Anchor Address (IPv4-LMAA) [11]

      The IPv4 address that is configured on the interface of a local
      mobility anchor and is the transport endpoint of the tunnel
      between the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway.
      This is the address to where the mobile access gateway sends the
      Proxy Binding Update messages.  If the local mobility anchor is
      configured to be behind a NAT device, this address will be the
      address allocated by the NAT device for that flow.

   o  IPv4 Proxy Care-of Address (IPv4-Proxy-CoA) [11]

      The IPv4 address that is configured on the interface of the mobile
      access gateway and is the transport endpoint of the tunnel between
      a local mobility anchor and a mobile access gateway.  This address
      will be used as the source address for the signaling messages sent
      by the mobile access gateway to the local mobility anchor and will
      be the registered Care-of address in the mobile node's Binding
      Cache entry.  However, when the configured address is a private
      IPv4 address and with a NAT device in the path to the local
      mobility anchor, the care-of address as seen by the local mobility
      anchor will be the address allocated by the NAT device for that
      flow.

   o  LMA Address (LMAA) [13]

      The address that is configured on the interface of the local
      mobility anchor and is the transport endpoint of the bi-
      directional tunnel established between the local mobility anchor
      and the mobile access gateway.  This is the address to where the
      mobile access gateway sends the Proxy Binding Update messages.
      When supporting IPv4 traversal, i.e., when the network between the
      local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway is an IPv4
      network, this address will be an IPv4 address and will be referred
      to as IPv4-LMAA, as specified in [ID-IPV4-PMIP6].

   o  Local Mobility [1]

      Local Mobility is mobility over an access network.  Note that
      although the area of network topology over which the mobile node
      moves may be restricted, the actual geographic area could be quite
      large, depending on the mapping between the network topology and
      the wireless coverage area.

   o  Local Mobility Anchor [12] (obsoleted by Local Mobility Anchor
      [13])

      A Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) is a router that maintains a
      collection of host routes and associated forwarding information
      for mobile nodes within a localized mobility management domain
      under its control.  Together with the MAGs associated with it, the
      LMA uses the NETLMM protocol to manage IP node mobility within the
      localized mobility management domain.  Routing of mobile node data
      traffic is anchored at the LMA as the mobile node moves around
      within the localized mobility management domain.

   o  Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) [13]

      Local Mobility Anchor is the home agent for the mobile node in the
      Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  It is the topological anchor point for
      the mobile node's home network prefix and is the entity that
      manages the mobile node's binding state.  The local mobility
      anchor has the functional capabilities of a home agent as defined
      in Mobile IPv6 base specification [RFC-3775] with the additional
      capabilities required for supporting Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol as
      defined in this specification.

   o  Localized Mobility Management [1]

      Localized Mobility Management is a generic term for any protocol
      that maintains the IP connectivity and reachability of a mobile
      node for purposes of maintaining session continuity when the

      mobile node moves, and whose signaling is confined to an access
      network.

   o  Localized Mobility Management Domain [12] (obsoleted by Proxy
      Mobile IPv6 Domain (PMIPv6-Domain) [13])

      An Access Network in the sense defined in [1], in which mobility
      is handled by the NETLMM protocol.

   o  Localized Mobility Management Protocol [1]

      A protocol that supports localized mobility management.

   o  MAC Medium Access Control

   o  MAG see Mobile Access Gateway

   o  MN see Mobile Node

   o  MN-HNP see Mobile Node's Home Network Prefix

   o  MN-HoA see Mobile Node's Home Address

   o  MNID An authenticated MN identifier (e.g.  NAI, a SEND public key
      used by the MN for generating its CGAs,an IMSI or TMSI, etc.)

   o  MOBIKE IKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming

   o  Mobile Access Gateway [12] (obsoleted by Mobile Access Gateway
      (MAG) [13])

      A Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) is a functional network element that
      terminates a specific edge link and tracks mobile node IP-level
      mobility between edge links, through NETLMM signaling with the
      Localized Mobility Anchor.  The MAG also terminates host routed
      data traffic from the Localized Mobility Anchor for mobile nodes
      currently located within the edge link under the MAG's control,
      and forwards data traffic from mobile nodes on the edge link under
      its control to the Localized Mobility Anchor.

Internet-Draft           Terminology for NETLMM            February 2008


   o  Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) [13]

      Mobile Access Gateway is a function that manages the mobility
      related signaling for a mobile node that is attached to its access
      link.  It is responsible for tracking the mobile node's movements
      to and from the access link and for signaling the mobile node's
      local mobility anchor.

   o  Mobile Node (MN) [13]

      Throughout this document, the term mobile node is used to refer to
      an IP host or router whose mobility is managed by the network.
      The mobile node may be operating in IPv6 mode, IPv4 mode or in
      IPv4/IPv6 dual mode.  The mobile node is not required to
      participate in any IP mobility related signaling for achieving
      mobility for an IP address that is obtained in that Proxy Mobile
      IPv6 domain.

      Suggested Change:
      ----------------

      Within the scope of NETLMM, the term mobile node is used to refer
      to an IP host or router whose mobility is managed by the network.
      The mobile node may be operating in IPv6 mode, IPv4 mode or in
      IPv4/IPv6 dual mode.  The mobile node is not required to
      participate in any IP mobility related signaling for achieving
      mobility for an IP address that is obtained in that Proxy Mobile
      IPv6 domain.

   o  Mobile Node Identifier (MN-Identifier) [13]

      The identity of a mobile node in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.
      This is the stable identifier of a mobile node that the mobility
      entities in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain can always acquire and use
      it for predictably identifying a mobile node.  This is typically
      an identifier such as NAI or other identifier such as a MAC
      address.

   o  Mobile Node Identity [14] (obsoleted by Mobile Node Identifier
      (MN-Identifier)[13])

      An identity established for the mobile node when initially
      connecting to the localized mobility management domain.  It allows
      the localized mobility management domain to definitively and
      unambiguously identify the mobile node upon handoff for route
      update signaling purposes.  The mobile node identity is
      conceptually independent of the mobile node's IP or link-layer
      addresses, but it must be securely bound to the mobile node's

Internet-Draft           Terminology for NETLMM            February 2008


      handoff signaling.

   o  Mobile Node Interface Identifier (MN-Interface-Identifier) [13]

      The interface identifier that identifies a given interface of a
      mobile node.  For those interfaces that have a layer-2 identifier,
      the interface identifier can be based on that layer-2 identifier.
      The interface identifier in some cases is generated by the mobile
      node and conveyed to the access router or the mobile access
      gateway.  In some cases, there might not be any interface
      identifier associated with the mobile node's interface.

   o  Mobile Node's Home Address (MN-HoA) [13]

      MN-HoA is an address from a mobile node's home network prefix in a
      Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  The mobile node will be able to use
      this address as long as it is attached to the access network that
      is in the scope of that Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  Unlike in
      Mobile IPv6 where the home agent is aware of the home address of
      the mobile node, in Proxy Mobile IPv6, the mobility entities are
      only aware of the mobile node's home network prefix and are not
      always aware of the exact address(es) that the mobile node
      configured on its interface from that prefix.

   o  Mobile Node's Home Link [13]

      This is the link on which the mobile node obtained its Layer-3
      address configuration for the attached interface after it moved
      into that Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  This is the link that
      conceptually follows the mobile node.  The network will ensure the
      mobile node always sees this link with respect to the layer-3
      network configuration, on any access link that it attaches to in
      that Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.

   o  Mobile Node's Home Network Prefix (MN-HNP) [13]

      This is the on-link IPv6 prefix that is always present in the
      Router Advertisements that the mobile node receives when it is
      attached to any of the access links in that Proxy Mobile IPv6
      domain.  This home network prefix is topologically anchored at the
      mobile node's local mobility anchor.  The mobile node configures
      its interface with an address from this prefix.  If the mobile
      node connects to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain through multiple
      interfaces, simultaneously, each of the connected interface will
      be assigned a unique home network prefix and under a different

Internet-Draft           Terminology for NETLMM            February 2008


   o  Multihomed Mobile Node [13]

      A mobile node that connects to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain
      through more than one interface and uses these interfaces
      simultaneously is referred to as a multihomed mobile node.

   o  NA Neighbor Advertisement

   o  NAI Network Access Identifier

   o  NAT Network Address Translation

   o  ND Neighbor Discovery

   o  NDP Neighbor Discovery Protocol

   o  NETLMM Network-Based Localized Mobility Management

   o  Network-based Localized Mobility Management Protocol (NLMP) [13]

      The NETLMM Protocol used in the backhaul of the NETLMM domain
      between MAGs and LMA

   o  NLMP see Network-based Localized Mobility Management Protocol

   o  NS Neighbor Solicitation

   o  OSPF Open Shortest Path First protocol

   o  PAD Peer Authorization Database

   o  PANA Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access

   o  PBA see Proxy Binding Acknowledgement

   o  PBU see Proxy Binding Update

   o  PMA Proxy Mobile Agent

   o  PMIP6 Proxy Mobile IPv6

   o  PMIPv6 Proxy Mobile IPv6

   o  PMIPv6-Domain see Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain

   o  Policy Profile [13]

      Policy Profile is an abstract term for referring to a set of

      configuration parameters that are configured for a given mobile
      node.  The mobility entities in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain
      require access to these parameters for providing the mobility
      management to a given mobile node.  The specific details on how
      the network entities obtain this policy profile is outside the
      scope of this document.

   o  PPP Point-to-Point Protocol

   o  Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) [13]

      A response message sent by a local mobility anchor in response to
      a Proxy Binding Update message that it received from a mobile
      access gateway

   o  Proxy Binding Update (PBU) [13]

      A signaling message sent by the mobile access gateway to a mobile
      node's local mobility anchor for establishing a binding between
      the mobile node's MN-HoA and the Proxy-CoA.

   o  Proxy Care-of Address (Proxy-CoA) [13]

      Proxy-CoA is the address configured on the interface of the mobile
      access gateway and is the transport endpoint of the tunnel between
      the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway.  The
      local mobility anchor views this address as the Care-of Address of
      the mobile node and registers it in the Binding Cache entry for
      that mobile node.  When the transport network between the mobile
      access gateway and the local mobility anchor is an IPv4 network
      and if the care-of address that is registered at the local
      mobility anchor is an IPv4 address, the term, IPv4-Proxy-CoA is
      used, as specified in [ID-IPV4-PMIP6].

   o  Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain (PMIPv6-Domain) [13]

      Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain refers to the network where the mobility
      management of a mobile node is handled using the Proxy Mobile IPv6
      protocol as defined in this specification.  The Proxy Mobile IPv6
      domain includes local mobility anchors and mobile access gateways
      between which security associations can be setup and authorization
      for sending Proxy Binding Updates on behalf of the mobile nodes
      can be ensured.

   o  Proxy CoA see Proxy Care-of Address

   o  QoS Quality of Service

   o  RA Router Advertisement

   o  RIP Routing Information Protocol

   o  RS Router Solicitation

   o  SEND SEcure Neighbor Discovery protocol

   o  SLAAC StateLess Address AutoConfiguration

   o  SONET Synchronous Optical Network

   o  SPD Security Policy Database

   o  UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System

   o  UWB UltraWide Band

   o  VLAN Virtual LAN

   o  VPN Virtual Private Network

   o  WLAN Wireless LAN

   o  WLAN Switch [1]

      A WLAN switch is a multiport bridge Ethernet [6] switch that
      connects network segments but also allows a physical and logical
      star topology, which runs a protocol to control a collection of
      802.11 [15] access points.  The access point control protocol
      allows the switch to perform radio resource management functions
      such as power control and terminal load balancing between the
      access points.  Most WLAN switches also support a proprietary
      protocol for inter-subnet IP mobility, usually involving some kind
      of inter-switch IP tunnel, which provides session continuity when
      a terminal moves between subnets.
