Abstract

     Xcast+[2] is newly proposed multicast scheme to support
     IGMPv2/MLDv3 in Explicit Multicast(Xcast)[1]. Xcast+ is suitable
     for one-to-few multicast applications. In order to support few-to-
     few communication naturally, the control plane of existing Xcast+
     should be extended. In this document, a new control plane for few-
     to-few communication for Xcast+ is specified. In order to acheive
     this, the concept of logical core (LC) is newly introduced.

1. Introduction

     Xcast is a new form of IP multicast, designed to provide scalable
     support for very large number of multicast groups, where these
     groups typically have a small number of participants. Xcast uses
     explicit encoding of destination list in the data packets, instead
     of multicast address. The source encodes the list of destinations
     in the Xcast header, and then sends the packet to a router. Each
     router along the way parses the header, partitions the destinations
     based on each destination's next hop, and forwards a packet with an
     appropriate Xcast header to each of the next hops. However, current
     Xcast specification seems to mention its data plane only, and does
     not specify a control plane.

     Xcast+ provides an enhanced scheme for the support of receiver
     initiated join in Xcast. This is achieved by adding IGMPv3/MLDv2
     queries at receivers' side and new registration/de-registration
     messages between designated routers (at sender's side and
     receivers' side), and then by explicitly encoding the list of
     address of the designated routers at receivers' side instead of
     receiver address Xcast+ encoding of the destination list in IPv4
     and IPv6 are the same as Xcast. Xcast+ is suitable for one-to-few
     multicast applications. In order to support few-to-few
     communication (e.g., audio/video conferencing applications)
     naturally, it is required to extend the control plane of existing
     Xcast+.

     This document describes a new control plane for few-to-few
     communication in Xcast+. In order to achieve this, the concept of
     LC is newly introduced. The role of LC is to manage group
     dynamically and provide encryption key for secure communication.
     The LC is not involved in data transmission at all. The encoding of
     the destination list in IPv4 and IPv6 are the same as Xcast+.

3. Overview

     In proposed scheme, a receiver initiates IGMP/MLD membership
     reports (*, G), where G is a standard multicast address. When a
     designated router (DR) at receivers' side receives the report, it
     sends new Registration Request messages (G, DR) to a LC. Thus, when
     the LC receives the message, it can keep track of the addresses of
     all DRs at the receivers' side involved in the multicast session
     (*, G) in its cache table.

     If other DRs that are involved in the multicast session (*, G)
     exist in cache table, the LC sends new member join request to the
     other DRs in order to inform them that the new DR just joins in the
     multicast group. In case of group leave, the same procedures are
     applied. These new messages format are specified in section 6.
     These procedures imply the new control plane for few-to-few
     communication in Xcast+.

     The role of LC is to manage group dynamically. The LC is not
     involved in data transmission. The encoding of the destination list
     in IPv4 and IPv6 are the same as Xcast+. For example, suppose that
     A, B, C, D, E and F are trying to send and receive packets each
     others in Figure 1 below: Detail operation examples for con trol
     plane will be described in section 4.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Xcast+ For Few-to-Few Communication       October 2002


4.1 Group Join

     In the Figure 1, we assume that host A first tries to join
     multicast group G. In this example, host A initiates (*,G) join to
     DR1 using IGMPv3/MLDv2. In this procedure, the difference exits
     between proposed mechanism and exiting Xcast+. In the proposed
     scheme, receivers should join with (*,G) because all receivers also
     could be senders, while receivers join with (S,G) using IGMPv3 in
     existing xcast+.

     DR1 sends a registration request message to LC to join a group G.
     In order to send the message, every DR needs to acquire the address
     of LC which has responsibility of management for group memership.
     This can be done by using bootstrap mechanism in PIM-SM or manual
     configuration of LC on every DR. Proposed scheme supposes the
     address of LC is already known to all DRs.

     Then, LC which received a registration request message queries
     requested group information in its group cache table. In the
     example, there are no DR entries in LC's group cache table as DR1
     initiated the first join. Therefore, LC just acknowledges group-
     join of DR1 by sending an registration reply message to DR1. If
     host B wants to join a group G later, DR2 will send a registration
     request message to LC. Then, LC should perform the following two
     works after receiving registration request because the other member
     already is being joined the multicast group.


     1)   LC sends DR2 a registration reply message including the
          address of DR1 stored in LC's group cache table. In this way,
          DR2 can get information of every other DR that already joined
          the group G.

     2)   DR1 also should know that DR2 is newly joined to a group G,
          consequently LC is required to notify newly-joined DR
          information(DR2 in this example) to all other DRs in group
          cache. In order to achieve this, LC uses a member join request
          message.

     Above two tasks are performed on LC. Every DR that received
     registration reply and member join request messages maintains
     addresses of other DRs for specific group G in their group cache
     table. These addresses of receivers will be inserted into xcast+
     header of sender for few-to-few communication


4.2 Group Leave

     In order to explain group leave procedures, suppose host A, B, D, E, 
     and F are joined a group G. In other words, the addresses of
     each host's DR1, DR2, DR3, and DR4 are supposed to be maintaining
     for a group G in LC.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Xcast+ For Few-to-Few Communication       October 2002


     If host A is the last one that leaves a group G in its subnet, DR1
     requests LC to leave the group by sending a de-registration request
     message. In this case, LC deletes DR1 from its group cache at first
     and then sends DR1 a de-registration request message to inform DR1
     that it completely leaves the group. Along with this procedure,
     DR2, DR3 and DR4 delete the address of DR1 from their group cache
     table as soon as they receive a member leave request message from
     LC, and send LC a member leave reply message for acknowledgement.
     In case that acknowledgement messages does not arrive from DR2, DR3
     and DR4, within specific time limit, LC sends member leave request
     messages once again to DRs that did not send acknowledgement.

     Even if the host D wishes to leave group, there is another receiver
     within same subnet, host E. So, any action is not taken into in
     this such case.


4.3 The Role of Logical Core

     As mentioned above, the LC plays very important roles for xcast+
     extension for few-to-few communication. This section describes the
     role of LC. The role of logical core summarized as two parts :
     multicast group management and encrption key management for secure
     communication between group members.


4.3.1 Group Management

     LC has the very similar functionality with core router in core
     based multicast protocol, e.g., CBT[3], in that the LC has the
     responsibility for dynamic multicast group management. However, the
     major difference between them is able to be identified as the
     logical core is not involved in data transmission at all. So, the
     LC surely does not have to be a router. It means that the LC can be
     implemented as application server on general host.

     In the view point of group management, the group cache table is
     required to store the pair of group address and DR address
     information on LC. The group cache table data structure has the
     following fields: group address, designated router, and lifetime.
     The group address field indicates the multicast group address and
     designated router field store DR address, which has the hosts that
     wish to join mulitcast group within subnet. Finally, the lifetime
     field represent the number of seconds it would like its
     registration to last before it expires. Table 1 shows the example
     configuration of group cache table.

       Table 1 : The example of cache table for group management
       +-----------------------------------------------+
       |  Group address  | Designated Router| Lifetime |
       +-----------------------------------------------+
       | 224.223.232.234 | 211.123.123.1    |   10     |

       +-----------------------------------------------+
       | 224.223.232.234 | 63.23.32.1       |   10     |
       +-----------------------------------------------+

     The above group cache table is controlled by newly defined control
     messages which are designed to insert or delete the specific table
     entry. In addition to insertion or deletion on on table entries,
     the control messages must notify change of group member status of
     all group members so that the each DR can maintain the other
     members information consistently. The control messages are as
     follows.

      - Registration request
      - Registration reply
      - De-registration request
      - De-registration reply
      - Member join request
      - Member join reply
      - Member leave request
      - Member leave reply


4.3.2 Encryption Key Management

     Sometimes, it might be very important to ensures that information
     in the packet are accessible only for reading by authorized group
     members in few-to-few multicast application. For this purpose, it
     is recommended to introduce encryption algorithms for
     confidentiality.

     The first requirement to introduce encryption algorithm into this
     scheme is to prevent encryption key from being distributed to
     unauthorized users. So, the LC should maintain the authorized and
     legitimate member list and distribute encryption key only when the
     authorized members request. The above procedure is able to be
     implemented by commercial network key management protocols.


5. Data Transmission

     Even though the extension of control plane is required to provide
     efficient few-to-few communication, there is no requirement for the
     data transmission. So, the routing algorithm for Xcast packet is
     specified as same as Xcast.

     As you can see in Figure 1, when the host B has packet to send
     toward multicast group, it simply transmits multicast packets to
     the DR1. Once the DR2 receives the multicast packet from host
     within subnet, it searches the group cache table with multicast
     address to get the other members address, for example, DR2 and DR

     3. This address (DR2 and DR3) is encoded into Xcast+ header, which
     is defined in [2]. The routing scheme on intermediate router is
     exactly as same as Xcast+[2]. [2] can give a fuller explanation for
     Xcast routing algorithm on intermediate router along the path.


6. New Messages for few-to-few communication

     There are two kinds of messages : One is for the messages for
     request registration, de-registration, member join, and member
     leave and another is for the return reply message for each request
     message. The use of each message is already described in section 3.
     The newly defined message format is depicted as follows.


6.1 Message Format for IPv4

     All these messages are carried within the data portion of a UDP,
     which is in turn placed within the payload portion of an IP packet.
     The Xcast+ module in Xcast+ routers (at least DRs) MUST identify
     these messages by checking Destination Port field, which must be
     assigned by IANA in the future.

7. Requirement

     This section shows several requirements that should be added to
     support few-to-few communication based on LC. Those requirements
     are described for sender, receiver, and DR router.


7.1 Sender requirement

     In the proposed Xcast+ extension, sender just sends packets to DR
     after encoding target IP addresses to group addresses in the same
     way of existing xcast+. The difference exists in data
     confidentiality. To achieve data confidentiality, sender should
     encrypt data using the key delivered when logical core
     authenticates the group member.


7.2 Receiver requirement

     No difference exists in receiver requirement compared to existing
     Xcast+. If sender transmits encrypted data, decryption function
     should be added on the receiver's side using the key that logical
     core sends during join procedure.


7.3 Designated Router requirement

     In case of existing Xcast+, sender's DR just maintains the list of
     other DRs to have receivers, but in proposed mechanism each DR
     should maintain the list of all other DRs for specific multicast
     group in the same way as logical core. Each DR has group cache
     table with defined data structure in 4.3.1. These DR addresses are
     encoded into receiver list field of Xcast+ header, if hosts
     transmit data to Xcast+ group. Therefore, every DR should have data
     structure to maintain the list of DRs for specific multicast group
     in few-to-few communication.

     Each DR should transmit original multicast datagram to its subnet
     after removing Xcast+ header of delivered Xcast+ packets.
     Implementation of this procedure should be defined.


8. Mobility Support

     The proposed scheme can provide the multicast in mobile environment
     without any difficulty or modification. The existing schemes for
     multicast in mobile environment fall into two categories: one is to

     rely on the tunneling between Home Agent (HA) and Foreign Agent
     (FA) and other is to rely on tree reconstruction from source of
     multicast group to current FA. First is called HA based mechanism
     and second is called as FA based mechanism.

     Now that the Xcast+ is not dependent on multicast state on
     intermediate router for transmitting multicast packet at all, there
     is no extra overhead for tree construction and management. So, the
     proposed scheme is designed as same way with latter scheme. The how
     to apply in mobile environment is described as shown in Figure 2.

                     MH B

      Figure 2. The example configuration in mobile network

     As you can see in Figure 2, there is four Base Stations (BS), one
     LC, six Xcast-capable routers (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6) , and
     four mobile host (MH A, MH B, MH C, and MH D). We assume that each
     BS has the same functionality of DR and MH A, MH B, MH C, and MH D
     are being joined multicast group G.

     When the MH A moves and connects to BS4, MH A listens to agent
     advertisement message and determines whether it is connected to HA
     or FA. Whether MH A is connected to HA or FA, the MH A notifies BS4
     through IGMP/MLD protocol that the MH A wishes to join multicast
     group G. Since there is no group information on BS4, BS4 requests
     registration by sending registration request message to LC. It is
     the same procedure as the any host within administrative scope of
     BS4 wishes to join multicast group.

     On the other hand, it happens that BS1 does not need to provide
     service for multicast group G any more since there is no host that
     wish to receive multicast data for group G. So, BS1 requests de-
     registration according to the procedures described in above section
     4.2. Once LC receives the registration request or de-registration
     message, the LC modifies the corresponding cache table entry. And

INTERNET-DRAFT    Xcast+ For Few-to-Few Communication       October 2002


     this modification result is distributed to each DRs so that it
     updates the cache table entry of each DRs.

     On the other hand, when MH C handoffs from BS3 to BS2, the MH C
     requests the group join through IGMP/MLD. However, since BS2
     already has the other group member within its subnet, MH B, it is
     not required to send registration request message to LC. In the
     same manner, the BS3 does not send de-registration request message
     due to having another group member.

     Even if there might be drop of packets during the control messages
     exchange between LC and group members are completed, it is
     considered as short duration. Furthermore, it can support mobility
     of sender and always select the optimized path to transmit the
     multicast packet.


9. Security considerations

     In terms of confidentiality, the packet encryption might be easily
     obtained encryption key allocated in advance encryption key per
     group. This key must be kept secure in LC. Other considerations for
     Xcast security, that is, receiver authentication, integrity, access
     control, and nonrepudiation, mostly rely on [5].


10. Simulation Notes

     We develop the simulation codes for Xcast+ extension based on LC
     with Network Simulator (NS). The simulation source code is avaiable
     at http://lionking.cnu.ac.kr/~multicast.
