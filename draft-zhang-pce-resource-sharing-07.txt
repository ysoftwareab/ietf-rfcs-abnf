Abstract 
 
   Resource sharing in a network means two or more Label Switched Paths 
   (LSPs) use common piece(s) of resource along their paths. This can 
   help save network resource and is useful in scenarios such as LSP 
   recovery or when two LSPs do not need to be active at the same time. 
   A Path Computation Element (PCE) is responsible for path computation 
   with such requirement. Given this feature and its access to the 
   network resource information and possibly active LSPs information, 
   it can be used to support resource-sharing-based path computation 
   with better efficiency. 

   This document extends the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) 
   in order to support resource sharing-based path computation.

1. Introduction and Motivation 

   A Path Computation Element (PCE) provides an alternative way for 
   providing path computation function, and it is especially useful in 
   the scenarios where complex constraints and/or a demanding amount of 
   computation resource are required [RFC4655]. The development of PCE 
   standardization has evolved from stateless to stateful. A stateful 
   PCE has access to the LSP database information of the network(s) it 
   serves as a computation engine [Stateful-PCE]. Unless specified, 
   this document assumes a PCE mentioned is a stateful PCE (either 
   passive or active). 
    
   Resource sharing denotes that two or more Label Switched Paths 
   (LSPs) share common piece(s) of resource, (such as a common time 
   slot of a link in an Optical Transport Network (OTN)). This is 
   usually useful in the scenario where only one LSP is active and the 
   benefit herein is to save network resources. A simple example of 
   this is dynamically calculating a LSP for an existing LSP undergoing 
   a link failure. Note that the resource sharing can be worked out 
   using a statelss PCE, but the mechanism may be complex and is out 
   the scope of this draft.  
    
   This document considers the following requirement: new LSP may 
   request for resource sharing with one or multiple existing LSPs. 
   Furthermore, if there is resource sharing between new LSP and 
   existing LSP, the two LSPs cannot exist simultaneously, the new LSP 
   will replace the existing LSP(s). 
    
   In a single domain, this is a common requirement in the recovery 
   cases especially in order to increase traffic resilience against 
   failure while reducing the amount of network resource used for 
   recovery purpose [RFC4428].  
    
   The current protocol supporting the communication between a PCE and 
   a Path Computation Client (PCC), i.e. PCE Protocol (PCEP), allows 
   for re-optimization of an existing LSP [RFC5440]. This is achieved 
   by setting R bit in the Request Parameter (RP) object, together with 
   some additional information if applicable, in the Path Computation 
   Request (PCReq) message sent from a PCC to the PCE. To support this 
   type of resource sharing, a PCC needs to ask a PCE to compute a new 
   path with the constraints of sharing resource with one or multiple 
   existing LSPs. It is worth noting the "resource sharing" in this 
   draft not only means one LSP re-using the same link(s) of another

   LSP, but also the same slice of bandwidth. This may occur when an 
   LSP is required for re-routing, or online re-optimization. Current 
   PCEP specifications do not provide such function. More specifically, 
   this draft describes the resource sharing issue during the procedure 
   when a new LSP is required to replace an existing LSP, which can be 
   used together with Make-before-break (MBB) described in [RFC3209]. 
   There are a few objects which indicate the resource sharing/disjoint 
   relationships, such as SRLG and ASSOCIATE. However, these objects 
   are used to describe the relationship with two simultaneous LSPs, 
   instead of a new one and an old one, which is different with the 
   object proposed in this draft.  
    
   As mentioned in [stateful-PCE], the PLSP-ID is unique during a PCEP 
   session between PCC and PCE. Such identification is helpful in 
   supporting the above resource sharing requirement for 
   standardization of stateful PCEs.  With a unique identifier, the 
   configuration of PCCs is greatly simplified. Instead of determining 
   all the resources to be shared, the PCC could request resource 
   sharing directly from PCE. 
    
   The resource sharing can also be required in an inter-layer PCEP 
   session. This is similar to the previous requirement. However, it is 
   more complex and therefore deserves a more detailed explanation 
   here.  
    
   In a multi-layer network, Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in a lower 
   layer are used to carry higher-layer LSPs across the lower-layer 
   network [RFC5623]. Therefore, the resource sharing constraints in 
   the higher layer might actually relate to the resource sharing in 
   the lower layer. Thus, it is useful to consider how this can be 
   achieved and whether additional extensions are needed using the 
   models defined in [RFC5623]. 
    
   In the next sections, use cases are provided to show what 
   information needs to be exchanged to fulfill these requirements. 
   This memo then provides extensions to PCEP to enable this function.  
    
2. Motivation 

2.1. Single PCE Use Case 

   Figure 1 shows a single domain network with a stateful PCE. Assume a 
   working LSP (N1-N2-N3) exists in the network, when there is failure 
   on the link N2-N3, it is desired to set up a restoration path for 
   this working LSP. Suppose N1 serves as the PCC and sends a request 
   to the stateful PCE for such an LSP. Before sending the request, N1 
   may need to check what policy should be applied for the path re-

   computation. For example, it might value resource sharing and prefer 
   to share as much resource with the working LSP as possible and 
   specify this policy in the PCReq message.  If resources are shared 
   between the old and new LSPs, there will be some 'interruption' when 
   the traffic is switched from the old LSP to the new LSP. Here the 
   resources to be shared mean the LSP information, which includes the 
   node, link and corresponding SRLG information, etc.  
    
   On the other hand, in some scenarios there are different policies, 
   for example the LSP should be restored without any interruption with 
   best effort. An example can be found in Fig. 1 without failure on 
   N2-N3 link, instead, an online re-optimization is needed for the 
   working LSP (N1-N2-N3) from the stateful PCE. In such cases, the 
   best choice is to set up a backup LSP for the working LSP with 
   totally separate routing (for example N1-N5-N4-N3), and move the 
   traffic to that backup LSP. After that the working LSP can be torn 
   down, which will not result in any interruption during the 
   optimization procedure. This can actually be implemented with 
   existing PCEP mechanism. However, if there is no such separate path, 
   existing PCEP will reply error. A secondary option for this case is 
   to set up an LSP and complete such re-optimization with resource 
   sharing, even if some interruption introduced. Given the resource 
   from the LSP to be interrupted, there may be some solutions instead 
   of Path Compute error due to the lack of resource.  
    
   A simple illustration is provided below:

   Available recovery paths computed by the stateful PCE: 
    
   LSP1: N1-N2-N4-N3 
   LSP2: N1-N5-N4-N3 
    
   If resource sharing is preferred, the stateful PCE will reply with 
   LSP1 information. Instead, if PCC prefer to have less interruption, 
   PCE will reply with LSP2 information.  
    
   Another piece of information that needs to be conveyed to the PCE is 
   the information about the working path LSP. Note this simple use 
   case assumes end-to-end recovery. But in order to be applicable to 
   use cases such as shared mesh protection purpose, where the head-end 
   or tail-end nodes may be different, this information is necessary in 
   the message exchange between PCCs and PCEs, so that the stateful PCE 
   knows which LSP the path computation request wants to share the 
   resource. 
    
   Besides, parameter changes during the resource sharing computation 
   also need to be considered. For example, the bandwidth of the 
   request LSP may be different with the existing LSP, while resource 
   sharing is still preferred by the PCC. PCE should consider the 
   sharing request together with the policy and available resource(s) 
   in the network. Details can be found in Section 3.3.  
              
2.2. Multiple PCEs Use Case 

   Figure 2 shows a two-layer network example, with each layer managed 
   by a PCE. As Discussed in Section 3 of [RFC5623], there are three 
   models for inter-layer path computation. They are single PCE 
   computation, multiple PCE with inter-PCE communication and multiple 
   PCE without inter-PCE communication, respectively. For the single 
   PCE computation, the process would be similar to that of the use 
   case in Section 2.1. Thus, this model is not discussed further.

               Figure 2: A Two-layer Network Example 
                
   An inter-layer path computation example is shown in Fig. 2, assume a 
   LSP (LSP1: H2-H3) has been established already, visible as H2-H3 
   from view of higher-layer PCE and H2-L1-L2-H3 from the global view 
   (or from the view of lower-layer PCE). A new request comes at H2 to 
   establish a new LSP (LSP2: from H2 to H5), given the constraint it 
   can share resource with LSP1. This requirement is possible if only 
   one of the LSPs needs to be active and resource sharing is the 
   target. 
    
   If multiple PCE with inter-PCE communication model is employed, the 
   path computation request sent by H2 to higher-layer PCE will be 
   forwarded to lower-layer PCE since there is no resource readily 
   available in the higher layer. So it leaves the lower-layer PCE to 
   compute a path in the lower layer in order to support the higher 
   layer request. In this case, lower-layer PCE is required to compute 
   a path between H2 and H5 under the constraint that it can share the 
   resource with that of the LSP1. At this moment the lower-layer PCE 
   has the knowledge on the explicit routing that LSP1 go through (H2-
   L1-L2-H3), and therefore can map the lower layer LSP with the 
   higher-layer one. So when lower-layer PCE computes the path for 
   LSP2, it can consider the resource used by LSP1 as available with 
   higher priority. For example, lower-layer PCE may choose H2-L1-L2-
   L4-H5 as the computation result. On the other hand, if the path 
   computation policy is to have a separate path with LSP1, the lower-
   layer PCE may choose H2-L1-L3-L4-H5.  
    
   During this procedure higher-layer PCE can only use LSP1 information 
   (such as its five-tuple LSP information) as the information, an 
   issue to solve is how lower-layer PCE can resolve this information 
   to the actual resource usage in its own layer, i.e. lower layer. 
   This could be solved by edge LSR L1 reporting this higher-lower

   layer LSP correlation to the lower-layer PCE as part of the LSP 
   information during the LSP state synchronization process. If needed, 
   it can be later updated when there is a change in this information. 
   Alternatively, the lower-layer PCE can get this information from 
   other sources, such as network management system, where this 
   information should be stored. 
    
   If multiple PCE without inter-PCE communication model is employed, 
   the path computation request in the lower layer will be initiated 
   the border LSR node, i.e., L1. The process would be similar to that 
   of the previous scenario. A point worth noting is that the border 
   LSR node may be able to resolve the higher layer LSP information 
   itself, such as mapping it to the corresponding LSP in the lower 
   layer, in this way lower-layer PCE does not need to perform this 
   function. Otherwise, the mapping method mentioned above can still be 
   used.  
    
3. Extensions to PCEP 

   This section provides PCEP extensions. Currently the text focuses 
   only on passive stateful PCE and corresponding PCReq. But if active 
   stateful PCE delegation is used, we would like to convey the same 
   information in PCRpt. In the passive stateful PCE architecture, a 
   PCC is allowed to specify resource sharing when sending a PCReq 
   message. It also details the processing rule and error codes needed. 

3.1. Association group and type 

   According to the definition in [ietf-pce-association-group], the 
   association group is used to associate multiple LSPs into one group 
   for further path computation considerations, such as disjointness 
   and resource sharing. An association ID will be used to identify the 
   resource sharing group. An association type that described 
   disjointness has been defined in [ietf-pce-association-diversity]. 
   In this draft, a new association type is defined as:  

      Association type = TBD1 ("Sharing Association Type"). 

   A sharing group should have multiple LSPs. The number of LSPs and 
   the criteria for how LSPs share among each other are implementation 
   dependent. Local path computation policies apply to different PCE 
   and PCC, some examples can be found in section 2.  

3.2. Resource Sharing TLV

   Currently the following flags have been defined:  

   *  L (Link share) bit: when set, this flag indicates that the PCE 
   should prioritize the links that shared by existing LSPs within the 
   sharing group for path computation. 

   *  N (Node share) bit: when set, this flag indicates that the PCE 
   should prioritize the nodes that shared by existing LSPs within the 
   sharing group for path computation. 

   *  S (SRLG share) bit: bit: when set, this flag indicates that the 
   PCE should set the SRLG (Shared Risk Link Group) of the computed LSP 
   to the same as existing LSPs within the sharing group for path 
   computation.  

   Optional TLVs may be needed to indicate the LSP(s) with which the 
   resource is shared. If multiple LSPs are required, the PCE may need 
   to consider different sharing policies, which is implementation 
   dependent and may result in a different computing result. The 
   selection policy among multiple computation result is out of the 
   scope of this draft.

3.3. Processing Rules 

   To request a path allowing sharing resource with one or multiple 
   existing LSPs, a PCC includes a Resource Sharing TLV in the 
   association group object in the PCReq message. 

   On receipt of a PCReq message with a Resource Sharing TLV, a 
   stateful PCE MUST proceed as follows: 

     - If the Resource Sharing TLV is unknown/unsupported, the PCE will 
     follow procedures defined in [RFC5440].  That is, the PCE sends a 
     PCErr message with error type 3 or 4 (Unknown / Not supported 
     object) and error value 1 or 2 (unknown / unsupported object class 
     / object type), and the related path computation request is 
     discarded.   

     - If Resource Sharing TLV are unknown/unsupported and the P bit is 
     set, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with error type 3 or 4 
     (Unknown / Not supported object) and error value 4 
     (Unrecognized/Unsupported parameter), and the related path 
     computation request MUST be discarded as defined in [RFC5440]. 

     - If the resource sharing TLV is extracted correctly, the PCE MUST 
     apply the requested resource sharing requirement.   

   The procedure of setting flags follows the rules defined in Section 
   3.1. The RSO flags may be locally configured on the requesting nodes 
   via external entities, such as a network management system or the 
   entity that impose the resource sharing requirement.  

   It is worth noting that the Resource Sharing TLV can be used 
   together with other path indication objects like IRO/XRO, with 
   difference objectives. The first difference is, the use of Resource 
   Sharing TLV is to setup an alternative path, instead a new path. It 
   is also dependent on the knowledge of PCC, e.g., if the PCC have a 
   full knowledge of the path information and have strong preference on 
   the route, it may send the PCReq with IRO message to specify the 
   route. On the other hand, if the PCC does not know how the path 
   should go but just want to set up a new LSP to replace the old one, 
   it may use the Resource Sharing TLV instead of IRO. The second 
   difference is, resource Sharing TLV is a loose requirement. For 
   example, if the constraint specified in IRO/XRO in an A-Z path 
   computation request cannot be satisfied, the PCRep from PCE to PCC 
   would be unsuccessful. However it is still possible to have a path 
   from the A-Z. If the target node/link/SRLG is set in Resource 
   Sharing TLV rather than IRO, the PCE may feedback a path that from 
   A-Z that not sharing the target specified in Resource Sharing TLV.

4. Security Considerations 

   Security of PCEP is discussed in [RFC5440] and [RFC6952]. The    
   extensions in this document do not change the fundamentals of 
   security for PCEP.  

   However, the introduction of the Resource Sharing TLV in association 
   group object provides a vector that may be used to probe for 
   information from a network. For example, a PCC that wants to 
   discover the path of an LSP with which it is not involved can issue 
   a PCReq with a Resource sharing TLV and may be able to get back 
   quite a lot of information about the path of the LSP through issuing 
   multiple such requests for different endpoints and analyzing the 
   received results. To protect against this, a PCE should be 
   configured with access and authorization controls such that only    
   authorized PCCs (for example, those within the network) can make  
   computation requests, only specifically authorized PCCs can make  
   requests for resource sharing, and such  requests relating to 
   specific LSPs are further limited to a select few PCCs. How such 
   access controls and authorization is managed is outside the scope of 
   this document, but it will at the least include Access Control 
   Lists.  

   Furthermore, a PCC must be aware that setting up an LSP that share 
   resources with another LSP may be a way of attacking the other LSP, 
   for example by depriving it of the resources it needs to operate 
   correctly. Thus it is important that, both in PCEP and the 
   associated signaling protocols, only authorized resource sharing is 
   allowed.
