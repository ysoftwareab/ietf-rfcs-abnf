1.   Introduction 
    
   The requirements for Assured Service are given in [Pierce1]. Many 
   other drafts and RFCs have addressed the assumed architecture for 
   the provision of SIP-based services. A lot of consideration has been

Internet Draft     Architecture for Assured Service    October 20, 2004 

   given to continued reliance on the pure peer-to-peer model on which 
   the Internet (and especially HTTP) has been based vs. migration to 
   centralized control models in which dedicated proxies perform 
   specific functions for the control of telephony services. This would 
   include, possibly, full knowledge of the state of each call. 
    
   While there is an wide-spread desire expressed in various IETF 
   discussions to maintain (or return to) the pure peer-to-peer 
   architecture, there has been increasing admissions in various drafts 
   that centralized control or intelligent "middleboxes" are required 
   in many cases. Some examples are: 
    
   1. RFC 3261 defines the notion of a "Call Stateful proxy", which 
   "retains state for a dialog from the initiating INVITE to the 
   terminating BYE request", i.e., for the duration of a call. However, 
   no use of this state has been included in the current version of SIP 
   [RFC3261]. 
    
   2. Draft-ietf-sipping-cc-framework-02 included the concept of a 
   "central control" signaling model. 
    
   3. The abstract for draft-ietf-sipping-service-examples-06 
   recognizes that "some [services] require the assistance of a SIP 
   Proxy", and it states that the flows shown assume "a network of 
   proxies, registrars, PSTN gateways, and other SIP servers". 
    
   4. RFC 3325 for identity and privacy is based fully on use of a 
   network of trusted SIP servers. It states that "these mechanisms 
   provide no means by which end users can securely share identity 
   information end-to-end without a trusted service provider." 
    
    
2.   Architectures 
    
   Various discussions and memos have identified two potential network 
   architectures for the provision of SIP services. They are briefly: 
    
2.1. End-to-end Architecture 
    
   All service provision is between and under control of the calling 
   and called party, referred to as "User Agent Client (UAC)" and "User 
   Agent Server (UAS)", respectively. This terminology of "client" and 
   "server" are based on the HTTP model from which this model is 
   derived and have no real significance to this model. Either end can 
   initiate a transaction. There is no device in-between which provides 
   service support, only routers for packets. Other required devices 
   (address translation, etc.) which the calling user must access are 
   simply additional UAS's. 
    
   There is no "Service Provider" for the voice service, only a 
   provider of the packet switched infrastructure.

Internet Draft     Architecture for Assured Service    October 20, 2004 

2.2. Service Provider Network Architecture 
    
   A Service Provider maintains and controls network elements which 
   play an active role in the provision of services to end users. These 
   network elements may be referred to as back-to-back user agents 
   (B2BUA), proxies, servers, middleboxes, or intermediaries but they 
   all have the common characteristic of being provided by a trusted 
   Service Provider and they provide an important logical function 
   between the end users. These elements terminate SIP messages, 
   perform service control, and send new or modified SIP messages to 
   other network elements or to the other user. The result is that no 
   SIP message goes directly from one UA to the other (unless 
   specifically authorized by the control element). 
    
   The "Service Provider" may be the same company or entity which 
   provides part or all of the packet switched infrastructure. 
    
    
3.   Required Architecture 
    
   In order to provide the security and feature control required for 
   Assured Service as defined in [Pierce1], it is necessary to utilize 
   the Service Provider Network Architecture in which proxies are used 
   to support call origination and termination for each user involved 
   in the service. The architecture is the "trapezoid" described in SIP 
   [RFC3261] as follows (figure actually copied from RFC 3263):

   However, the above architecture requires the addition of another 
   component to provide control of the user's data packets (voice) in 
   the Assured Service case. This is important since the packets 
   themselves need to be marked for preferential treatment, including 
   the ability to get preferential treatment" over the packet transfer 
   of another user. 
    
   There must be an edge router, as described in [RFC 2998] and RFC 
   [3313], generally at the boundary between the local network and the 
   core network. This may be between the Ethernet LAN and the IP 
   "cloud" or it may be between the locally controlled IP network and 
   the global IP network. In any case, its function is to regulate the 
   transport of priority marked packets into the core.

4.   Required Procedures 
    
4.1. Authentication 
    
   Each UA which might use the Assured Service capability must 
   authenticate with a designated proxy before any service activation 
   is attempted. Normally, this would be at the time the device is 
   powered on, connected to the network, or is initialized, or it might 
   be done at pre-determined time intervals. Whether or not this 
   authentication requires a user interaction (human entry of a 
   password, retina scan, etc.) is not important and depends on the 
   application. Such an authentication may be very time consuming, with 
   password verification and policy data-base look-ups. After this 
   authentication, this proxy must handle all session establishments, 
   both to and from this UA. 
    
   This authentication function may be performed when the user attempts 
   the first session setup, for example, when an individual is allowed 
   to use a common device by first "logging on" with their identity and 
   password. In fact, this is still an "authentication" function 
   performed before the session setup is attempted. However, in this 
   case, it must be understood that there may be an additional delay 
   due to the authentication process before a call can be placed. 
    
   This authentication process is not unique to the provision of the 
   Assured Service capability. It is also required for many other 
   services which are to be provided by the service provider's proxy 
   based on pre-established authorizations. 
    
4.2. Function of Proxy 
    
   Besides the processing of the authentication, each proxy is 
   responsible for a number of functions important to the provision of 
   Assured Service (as well as other services) and the handling of 
   interactions, where required, between different services. This 
   includes: 
    
   - maintaining state of all existing sessions which exist on all UAs 
     under its control (both originating and terminating proxies). The 
     proxy is fully "call-stateful" where "state" in this case includes 
     the identity of the endpoints in the session, the priority of the 
     session, and the addresses required to send further messages up- 
     and down-stream in the session, that is, any information which 
     might be needed for further processing of the session. 
      
   - maintaining knowledge of other services being used by the UA which 
     might need to be taken into consideration when applying the 
     Assured Service capabilities (both originating and terminating

Internet Draft     Architecture for Assured Service    October 20, 2004 

     proxies). 
      
   - verifying that the originating UA is allowed to establish the 
     session at the precedence level requested (originating proxy). 
      
   - performing a Call Admission Control function of deciding whether 
     or not a new call (and the resulting packet flow) can be setup 
     based on knowledge of the current load and the allowable load 
     (originating proxy). 
      
   - establish permission at the edge router for it to handle the 
     precedence marked packets from the UA (both originating and 
     terminating proxies). 
      
   - performing the timing function to control the diversion service 
     (terminating proxy). 
      
   - deciding when to preempt the end user and sending the appropriate 
     preempt messages to the other party (both originating and 
     terminating proxies). 
      
   - maintaining records of the use of the service, whether for 
     accounting or auditing purposes (both originating and terminating 
     proxies). 
    
4.3. Function of the Edge Router 
    
   The edge router serves the functions of ingress router and egress 
   router referred to in various RFCs. "Edge Router" is described in 
   RFCs [2998], [3313], and [3521]. 
    
   The edge router, under control of the proxy, decides which packets 
   are to be transported between networks or domains. If authorization 
   has not been granted for the transport of a specific packet flow at 
   the precedence level indicated in the packets, the edge router must 
   discard the packets. 
    
   Additionally, there may be cases in which a currently transported 
   packet stream must be stopped, for example, to support preemption. 
   Since the Assured Service may not be able to rely on the UA to stop 
   the flow, it may be necessary for the edge router, again under 
   control of the proxy, to stop transporting a particular flow. 
    
   An edge router may also be capable of recognizing traffic overload 
   and notifying other network entities of this situation. It may also 
   contain procedures to provide short-term relief from such overload 
   conditions, such as providing preferential treatment of some packets 
   based on their markings (for example, as defined in DiffServ). 
    
4.4. Function of User Agent 
    
   The User Agent may be either the end user's telephone device or a 
   gateway to a non-IP network. It is responsible for initiating or 
   terminating a call setup request with the responsible proxy. In 
 
Mike Pierce             Expires April 20, 2005                 [Page 7] 
Internet Draft     Architecture for Assured Service    October 20, 2004 

   addition, it is responsible for sending voice packets to and 
   receiving them from the appropriate edge router. 
    
4.5. Session Control 
    
   Session establishment and release should follow the same message 
   sequence as defined in SIP and its extensions for non-Assured 
   Service calls. There should not be any additional messages to setup 
   an Assured Service call. The only additional requirements are the 
   inclusion of: 
    
   - the priority level as defined in [Resource] in the INVITE 
      
   - security related information in every message which might consist 
     of an authentication header (AH) using cryptographic techniques to 
     allow the receiving end (user or proxy) to validate the 
     authenticity of the message before acting on it. (This requirement 
     is not unique to Assured Service, but is also required to provide 
     security for other capabilities.) 
    
   If preemption of sessions (calls) is supported, there may be unique 
   messages to control this function. 
    
5.   Security Considerations 
    
   This memo mostly deals with the architecture required to support the 
   necessary security. While it does not attempt to define the actual 
   security mechanisms used for authentication and authorization, it 
   establishes the service architecture required as a basis for 
   security.
