     2  Abstract 
         
        When one extrapolates from the ongoing evolutionary trends of IP 
        router / switch development and its role in the build-out of optical 
        core, edge, access and enterprise networks, it is reasonable to 
        reach the almost inescapable conclusion that within a few years, 
        there will be a complete physical separation of the commercial 
        equipment embodying various concerns, aspects, roles and functions 
        of data communications, Namely, 
         
           1. Separate equipment for transport (transmission, switching and 
        multiplexing) and traffic forwarding. 
         
           2. Separate equipment concerned with control, signaling, traffic 
        engineering, provisioning, protection and restoration control, as 
        well as, traffic and flow management, (generalized "softswitches"). 
         
           3. Separate equipment for network management, operations support, 
        measurement & metering, OAMP, inter-OSS, engineering management 
        (including performance management, availability management, security 
        management, accounting management), as well as life cycle support. 
         
        In essence, the prediction is that the future optical network 
        infrastructure is likely to be made up of at least four physically 
        separate and distinct but inter-connected overlay networks,

        variously concerned with a) Transport and Traffic Forwarding, b) 
        Control and Signaling, c) Management & Administration, and d) 
        Service Engineering Support. 
         
        The CoSION proposal is that the transport/forwarding, 
        control/signaling, and management/service engineering "planes" of 
        optical networking ought to be designed, implemented, embodied and 
        deployed in four physically separate (but co-joined) overlay 
        networks. Furthermore, the design of supporting protocols ought to 
        explicitly take into account in their specifications, this physical 
        separation of aspects and roles. Also, the protocol engineering and 
        designs should be fashioned in way that allows the four networks to 
        evolve semi-autonomously. This can be achieved by defining and 
        supporting open interfaces between and within the various overlay 
        networks. 
         
        Commercially, different equipment suppliers and vendors are likely 
        to be interested in producing network elements for the four overlay 
        network types. 
         
        This report proposes that this outcome of physical separation of 
        aspects and roles be explicitly acknowledged and taken into account 
        within the IETF in the future evolution of the MPLS and GMPLS 
        protocol suites, as well as those of other protocol suites for 
        control, traffic engineering, management and measurement that will 
        constitute the core of the Control and Signaling overlay networks 
        for optically-based next generation networks. 
         
        The most direct impact on the protocol engineering in the IETF will 
        be a re-packaging via a careful separation of aspects of protocols 
        in some existing protocol suites, (such as MPLS, GMPLS), into well-
        defined and standardized open interfaces. All these protocols are 
        concerned with transport/forwarding support, management & 
        administration support and "true" control and signaling and 
        feedback. This will then be followed by future protocol extensions 
        in each overlay network plane.

           4  Introduction 
        We start with a definition of an acronym that helps to explain the 
        essence of the ConSION proposal. 
         
        SOCAR stands for Separation Of Concerns, Aspects and Roles. Now that 
        it has been given a pronounceable acronym, it is clear that the 
        SOCAR principle has indeed been applied numerous times in 
        communications protocol design and engineering in the IETF and other 
        bodies. 
         
        The most familiar examples of its application include the protocol 
        "layer" concept in the OSI 7-layer model and the related layering 
        concepts in other protocol suites such as TCP/IP, SNA, DECnet, WAP, 
        etc. Over the years, several groups have found it necessary to 
        introduce "sub-layers" and "shim" layers such as those for SNAP/LLC 
        and for G/MPLS [RFC3031], [RFC3034], [RFC3035], [RFC3036], 
        [GMPLSx01], [GMPLSx02]. 
         
        The Broadband-ISDN and ATM community expanded this layer separation 
        by introducing the concept of protocol "planes" orthogonal to the 
        layers. Thus, one can talk about the User/Data plane (U-plane), the 
        Control plane (C-plane) and the Management plane (M-plane). The 
        protocol layers and the planes together form a matrix space. 
         
        All of the above applications of the SOCAR principle are to be 
        considered the use of "logical" SOCAR in that each is focused on the 
        conceptual and abstract separation of aspects, roles and functions 
        in data communications. 
         
        There is a related, but less familiar concept called "physical" 
        SOCAR. It is physical SOCAR that is being advocated by the ConSION 
        proposal to be systematically applied to future protocol suites 
        development, particularly for intelligent optical networks (I.O.N.). 
         
        Physical SOCAR states that aspects, roles and functions that are 
        logically separated can be and should also be embodied and 
        implemented in physically separate network elements, variously 
        termed engines, servers, gateways, devices and units. Furthermore, 
        it should be acknowledged from the start that different vendors and 
        manufacturers can supply these physically separate devices. 
        Therefore, the physically separate embodiment and the potential 
        multi-vendor situation should be explicitly taken into account in 
        the protocol engineering. In particular, open interfaces should be 
        specified at SOCAR separation boundaries. 
         
        One example of the application of the physical SOCAR principle in 
        protocol engineering is the SS7 standard for common channel 
        signaling (CCS)[ITUQ7xx]. The POTS/PSTN/ISDN network is physically 
        separate from the controlling signaling network (the SS7 network). A 
      
     draft-amenyo-consion_00.txt        Expires February 2002      [Page 3] 
               ConSION Control & Signaling Intelligence for O.N.August 2001 
        second example is the ongoing work on Softswitch for the convergence 
        of traditional POTS/Voice with the newer VOIP / Internet telephony 
        [SOFTSWCH]. The media gateways are physically separate from the 
        media gateway controllers, together with open protocol suites being 
        defined for the interface between them (for example, SIP [RFC2543], 
        Megaco/MGCP [RFC2805], [RFC3015] or H.248/H.323). 
         
        Optical networking will play very significant roles in the 
        development, deployment, operation and management of next generation 
        data communication networks and infrastructures. Already the logical 
        SOCAR principle has started to be applied to the specification of 
        these networks. An example is the ASON (Automatic Switched Optical 
        Networks) concept [ASONx01] that logically separates the O.N 
        architecture into the Transport/Forwarding (T&F) plane, Control & 
        Signaling (C&S) plane, and the Management & Administration (M&A) 
        plane. 
         
        The ConSION proposal advocates that the physical SOCAR principle 
        should also be applied systematically to the future development of 
        protocol suites for I.O.N. 
         
        According to the ConSION concept, the logical separation planes 
        advocated by the ASON model should also be extended in the following 
        manner. Its logical planes will be implemented as physically 
        separate (but interconnected) overlay networks. 
         
        Therefore, the CoSION model recognizes at least four overlay 
        networks that together constitute a next generation I.O.N.: 
         
              1. Transport & Forwarding (T&F) Overlay Network. 
              2. Control & Signaling (C&S) Overlay Network. 
              3. Management & Administration (M&A) Overlay Network. 
              4. Service Engineering (S&E) Overlay Network. 
         
     5  ConSION Architectural Model 
         
        The choice that there are only four overlay networks in the ConSION 
        proposal is completely arbitrary, but it is both necessary and 
        sufficient for the development a set of protocol suites for 
        intelligently controlled, next generation optical networks and 
        infrastructures. 
         
         
        Furthermore, the ConSION proposal advocates that open interfaces 
        should be defined between each pair of the overlay networks, 
        together with the specification of open protocol suites that 
        implement these interfaces. 
         
        Figure 1 shows at a high level, the collection of inter-overlay 
        network open interfaces that need to be defined and specified as 
        protocol suites (TF<---->CS, TF<---->MA, TF<---->SE, CS<---->MA, 
        CS<---->SE and MA<---->SE). These open interfaces are labeled 
        In.TF.CS, In.TF.MA, In.TF.SE, In.CS.MA, In.CS.SE and In.MA.SE, 
        respectively. The prefix In stands for interface or "intelligence".

                       Figure [1]: ConSION Architectural Model                 
                                                                               
         
        In a graybox approach (in contrast to a blackbox or a whitebox 
        approach), the proposal also advocates that open interfaces should 
        be specified between (some) of the network elements and components 
        inside each overlay network. These intra-overlay network interfaces 
        (endo-interfaces) can be labeled: In.TF.TF, In.CS.CS, In.MA.MA and 
        In.SE.SE. 
         
        This systematic use of open interfaces will allow different vendors 
        to produce network elements for different overlay networks and for 
        the different parts of the overlay networks. 
         
        One implication for IETF protocol engineering is that open 
        interfaces and associated protocol suites should be specified so 
        that IP forwarding can physically separated from IP control &

        signaling (mainly route calculations by routing protocols). 
        Similarly, G/MPLS forwarding should be allowed to become physically 
        separate from G/MPLS control & signaling. Currently, all these 
        aspects and roles are inter-mixed and conflated in the protocol 
        proposals, specifications and documents from IETF and the other 
        bodies. 
         
        At another more detailed level, it should be explicitly recognized 
        and accommodated (in the protocol engineering efforts) that each 
        overlay network is actually an internet (an infrastructure 
        consisting of a network of networks.) More importantly, the 
        governing principle is that in actual operational deployment, each 
        overlay network will be partitioned or tessellated into separate 
        Administrative Domains (AD). The AD-networks are then co-joined via 
        bilateral peering and/or via inter-exchange or inter-connect points 
        (called inter-AD domains). Examples of inter-AD domains include 
        NAPs, MAEs, ISP IXs and carrier hotels. 
         
        Of course the principle of segmentation by AD domains is well 
        recognized in the IETF community and has been applied to great 
        effect in the definition of IGP (intra-domain) and EGP (inter-
        domain) routing protocols such as OSPF [RFC2328] and BGP4 [RFC1771]. 
        The ConSION proposal is merely advocating that the principle be 
        adopted and systematically applied in all future development of 
        protocol suites that are meant to control and manage optically-based 
        networking infrastructures. 
         
        Therefore, in the spirit of applying the physical SOCAR within each 
        overlay network (In.TF.TF, In.CS.CS, In.MA.MA and In.SE.SE), open 
        interfaces and accompanying protocol suites are required for all of 
        the following cases. For each overlay network, 
         
           1. Open interfaces between network elements belonging to the same 
        AD in the overlay network (ADi.NE1 <----> ADi.NE2). These are the 
        so-called "private NNIs_. In the CoSION model and architecture, 
        there are four types: private TF.NNI, private CS.NNI, private MA.NNI 
        and private SE.NNI. 
         
           2. Open interfaces between network elements belonging to 
        different ADs (or to different inter-ADs) in the overlay network 
        (ADi.NE1 <----> ADj.NE2). These are the so-called "public NNIs_ 
        (network-to-network interfaces). Again in CoSION, there will be four 
        types: public TF.NNI, public CS.NNI, public MA.NNI and public 
        SE.NNI. 
         
           3. Open interfaces between network elements belonging to an AD 
        and network elements belonging to an inter-AD in the overlay 
        network: (ADi.NE1 <----> inter-ADk.NE2). These are termed "public" 
        inter-NNI (iNNIs). Again the four types are: public TF.iNNI, public 
        CS.iNNI, public MA.iNNI and public SE.iNNI. 
         
           4. Open interfaces between network elements in an AD and network 
        element in an outside, external or "access" (AC) exo-network: 
        (ACj.NE1 <----> ADi.NE2). These are termed (public) _UNIs_ (user-to-

        network interfaces), with the following four types: TF.UNI, CS.UNI, 
        MA.UNI and SE.UNI. 
         
        In summary, the ConSION model is advocating that all the IETF 
        protocol suites relevant to the deployment, operation and management 
        of optical networking infrastructures be re-organized and re-
        packaged to explicitly support all of the following open interfaces 
        and their associated collections of protocol suites. 
         
           A) Inter-overlay network interfaces 
         
              1. In.TF.CS: (TF.ADx.NE1::CS.ADz.NE2). 
              2. In.TF.MA: (TF.ADx.NE1::MA.ADy.NE3). 
              3. In.TF.SE: (TF.ADx.NE1::SE.ADw.NE4). 
              4. In.CS.MA: (CS.ADz.NE2::MA.ADy.NE3). 
              5. In.CS.SE: (CS.ADz.NE2::SE.ADw.NE4) 
              6. In.MA.SE: (MA.ADy.NE3::SE.ADw.NE4). 
         
           B) Intra-overlay network interfaces 
              7. In.TF.TF: 
                    (TF.UNI, public TF.NNI, private TF.NNI, public TF.iNNI) 
              8. In.CS.CS: 
                    (CS.UNI, public CS.NNI, private CS.NNI, public CS.iNNI) 
              9. In.MA.MA: 
                    (MA.UNI, public MA.NNI, private MA.NNI, public MA.iNNI) 
             10. In.SE.SE: 
                    (SE.UNI, public SE.NNI, private SE.NNI, public SE.iNNI) 
         
        This protocol "re-engineering" will affect the future efforts of 
        several IETF WGs such as forces, ipo, iporpr, ccamp, mpls, gsmp and 
        the routing protocols WGs. 
         
     6  Practical Transport and Forwarding Overlay Networks 
         
        The T&F overlay networks to be controlled are expected to be built 
        out of such network elements as Optical cross-connects (OXCs or 
        OCXs); Optical Add-Drop multiplexers (OADMs); Optical switches; 
        Optical gateways and bandwidth managers; Wavelength routers or 
        wavelength switching routers; Optical waveband and fiber-level 
        switches; SONET/SDH (digital) cross-connects (DCS); SONET/SDH Add-
        Drop multiplexers (ADMs); DWDM transport equipment as well as CWDM 
        and OFDM variants; Free space optics (FSO) equipment; Photonic 
        packet switches (under research and development); multi-service 
        provisioning platforms (MSPPs); Passive Optical Networking (PON) 
        equipment; FTTx equipment (where x stands for Home (H), Curb (C), 
        Building (B)); Broadband access equipment (xDSL, Cable data, 
        Wireless Local Loop (WLL)); ATM switches and Frame Relay switches, 
        Integrated Access Devices (IADs); venerable switches, multiplexers 
        and concentrators for PDH transport; Ethernet switches and hubs 
        (Fast (100MbE), Gigabit (1GbE) and 10Gigabit (10GbE)); Metro-
        Ethernet and optical Ethernet (OpE) equipment; IP routers and router 
        switches (Multi-megabit, Gigabit, Terabit and even Petabit routers); 
        MPLS routers or switch routers, etc., etc.

               ConSION Control & Signaling Intelligence for O.N.August 2001 
        On the surface, the variety of devices that can be devoted to 
        transport and forwarding (T&F) in modern communications networks is 
        bewilderingly staggering. However, there are some organizing 
        principles that can be used to guide the design of the overlay 
        networks that will be used to intelligently control, manage and 
        operate T&F overlay networks. 
         
           1. Any viable and practical optical network is likely to include 
        more than just optical "processing" (transmission, switching, 
        multiplexing and routing) network elements. Pure optical networks 
        are likely to be inter-worked and integrated with other 
        infrastructures based on broadband networking, both fixed and mobile 
        wireless networking, as well as the venerable PSTN/ISDN networking. 
         
           2. For the purposes of control, signaling, network management, 
        service creation and administration, distinctions pertaining to 
        geographical scale are not particularly relevant. Thus, such 
        categorizations of optical networks for WAN, MAN, LAN, DAN, SAN, 
        HAN, PAN, long-haul, metro, premise, campus, core, backbone, edge, 
        access, distribution scales are mere "surface" conceptual structures 
        in the Chomskian sense for this purpose. 
         
           3. The really "deep" structure is the acceptance that different 
        parts of most transport and forwarding (T&F) infrastructures will be 
        under the control of different "administrative domains" (ADs), which 
        would nevertheless still need to inter-operate to support end-to-end 
        applications and services for distributed communications, messaging, 
        computing, remote and tele-operations, and content, media/multi-
        media access. However, this need to accommodate ADs is already built 
        into the ConSION model and architecture, right from the beginning. 
         
     6.1 Basic Transport & Forwarding (_Switching_) Types 
         
        The detailed specifications of what constitute the SOCAR aspects and 
        roles for transport and forwarding are for future documents and 
        beyond the scope of this report. However, it would seem that despite 
        the stupendous diversity of plausible T&F equipment, one could 
        classify the various ways of transport and forwarding according to a 
        small number of basic types of extant technologies for transmission, 
        multiplexing, relay and switching. Thus, for the further development 
        of the ConSION oriented protocol suites, one can identify parts of 
        the T&F overlay network that deal the following basic types of relay 
        modes or "switching", considering the current state of the art. 
         
              a. IPv4 forwarding (IP packet switching type 1) 
              b. IPv6 forwarding (IP packet switching type 2) 
              c. MPLS forwarding (Label switching or tag switching) 
              d. ATM Virtual Path (VP) transport (digital switching type 1) 
              e. ATM Virtual Circuit or FR Virtual Circuit (VC) T&F (type 2) 
              f. SONET transport (TDM forwarding type 1) 
              g. SDH transport (TDM forwarding type 2) 
              h. PDH transport (T1, E1, T3, E3, ISDN, etc.) (TDM T&F type 3) 
              i. DTR transport (TDM forwarding type 4) 
              j. WDM (DWDM, CWDM) wavelength switching, incl. conversion 
      
     draft-amenyo-consion_00.txt        Expires February 2002      [Page 8] 
               ConSION Control & Signaling Intelligence for O.N.August 2001 
              k. WDM waveband switching (type 2) 
              l. WDM sub-wavelength switching (type 3) 
              m. WDM fiber strand switching (type 4) 
              n. WDM fiber (multi-strand) switching (type 5) 
              o. WDM fiber bundle or cable (multi-fiber) switching (type 6) 
              p. OFDM switching (type 7) 
              q. Photonic packet switching (IP packet switching type 3) 
              r. Other forwarding, transport and switching types. 
         
        One can think of the overall T&F overlay network as a multi-colored 
        network made up of a collection of multiple overlay sub-networks. 
        Each overlay sub-network using a particular basic switching (or 
        forwarding and transport) type is given a separate color. So 
        according to the above classification, a comprehensive I.O.N T&F 
        overlay network is likely to be at least an 18-color sub-overlay 
        network. 
         
        Each of the above basic forwarding, transport and switching types 
        will need specific open interfaces that define how to explicitly 
        control and manage a _pure_ sub-overlay network built using just the 
        basic type. Thus, there are corresponding colored sub-overlay sub-
        networks composing the C&S and M&A overlay networks. 
         
        The work to define the detailed open interfaces and supporting 
        protocol suites is not as overwhelming as a comprehensive 
        enumeration of the basic T&F (switching) types would suggest. It is 
        clear that the C&S and M&A of the several cases share many similar 
        features. Therefore, one can rely on concepts that the software 
        object orientation community has labeled reuse, inheritance and 
        polymorphism in protocol specifications. 
         
        The application the reuse principle in protocol specifications is 
        quite pervasive in the IETF community. However, it has never been 
        systematically elevated to an engineering principle, and 
        systematically applied and supported by automation tools for the 
        (visual) assembly of protocol specifications and definitions.  
         
        Furthermore, other concepts from distributed components and object 
        orientation are not only useful for organizing protocol software but 
        also for protocol specifications. Namely, 
         
            a. DISTRIBUTED (protocol entities): with attendant focus on 
               inter-operation; operation on different and multiple 
               platforms; collaboration and cooperation of component; and 
               co-existence via translation, adaptation, wrapping and 
               encapsulation. 
         
            b. REUSE (of protocol definitions, specifications, details and 
               attribute frames): mainly via translation, adaptation, 
               encapsulation, augmentation, extension and supplementation. 
      
            c. INHERITANCE (of protocol abstractions, prototypes, classes, 
               instances, components' properties, attributes, relationships 
      
     draft-amenyo-consion_00.txt        Expires February 2002      [Page 9] 
               ConSION Control & Signaling Intelligence for O.N.August 2001 
               and inter-dependencies): focusing on sub-classes, 
               abstraction, customization and _personalization_. 
      
            d. POLYMORPHISM (of manipulations of protocol and interface 
               representations): focusing on functionals, operators and 
               combinators, parameterization. 
      
            e. IDL and CRL: Interface Definition Languages and (protocol) 
               Component Representation Languages. 
      
            f. META-DATA: introspection, self-describing, self-managing 
               protocol entities. 
      
         
        Thinking in this direction also points to the future of protocol 
        engineering as involving extensive automated protocol development. 
         
     6.2 Hybrid Transport & Forwarding Types 
         
        There are also hybrid "switching" types formed by inter-working 
        pairs of the basic types, such as those listed above: 
              a:b, a:c, a:d,..., a:q, a:r _ 
              p:a, p:b, p:c,..., p:o, p:q, p:r 
         
        For example, the designation (a:k) means that a particular transport 
        and forwarding scenario starts as IPv4 packet forwarding which then 
        gets inter-worked (mapped) into DWDM wavelength routing via 
        translation, adaptation, wrapping, "tunneling", etc., or vice versa. 
         
        The hybrid switching types do not result in an increase in the open 
        interfaces required. The control and management of a hybrid relay 
        type can be achieved by controlling and managing the underlying 
        basic types as well as the inter-working scheme mediating that 
        particular combination. 
         
     6.3 Metaphor of a Distinct Central Nervous System 
         
        The discussion above on the control and management of basic 
        switching types (as the essential elements of the transport and 
        forwarding overlay networks) indicates that the current debate in 
        the industry and protocol engineering and architecture community 
        concerning "overlay" vs. "peer" approaches to controlling optical 
        networks is in fact a red herring. One short summary of the debate 
        is whether the control "intelligence" should reside in the 
        optical/photonic layer or at the IP/data/electronic layer or both 
        [IPOVON]. 
         
        The physical SOCAR based ConSION proposal indicates that this is a 
        false distinction. The T&F aspects and overlay networks for next 
        generation networks are likely to involve both Optical elements and 
        IP-based networking elements. Faster progress will be made if the 
        controlling and management intelligences are implemented as 
        physically separate overlay networks. In each case, each overlay 
        network will also include both optical/photonic and electronic/IP 
      
     draft-amenyo-consion_00.txt        Expires February 2002     [Page 10] 
               ConSION Control & Signaling Intelligence for O.N.August 2001 
        network elements. Therefore, the "intelligence" does not really 
        reside in the optical nor in the electronic layer. 
         
        According to the CoSION programme, each optical network in the 
        future will have its own distinct and physically separate digital 
        "central nervous system" that controls and manages it, complete with 
        central pattern generators (CPGs) and C&S plus M&A transaction 
        coordinators. 
         
     7  The Overlay Networks and Logical SOCAR 
         
        A detailed discussion of the aspects and roles that fall into each 
        SOCAR plane are for future documents. Nonetheless, ongoing work in 
        the IETF and other bodies indicates the general outline of how the 
        concerns, aspects and roles are likely to be logically separated and 
        eventually also physically separated. 
         
     7.1 Control & Signaling Overlay Network 
         
        For the C&S overlay network, the aspects and concerns are likely to 
        include: 
         
           a. Automated Provisioning of bandwidth and mapping of traffic 
        flows onto bandwidth channels. 
         
           b. Restoration (based on pre-engineered protection schemes and 
        architectures), as well as other Fault Tolerance concerns. 
         
           c. Traffic Engineering. The satisficing and optimal use of T&F 
        resources, subject to service constraints and requirements. 
         
           d. IP (best-effort) route calculations and IP routing table 
        management. 
         
           e. LSP path calculations and LIB management for G/MPLS. 
         
     7.2 Management & Administration Overlay Network 
         
        The aspects to be implemented in this overlay network are likely to 
        include: 
         
           a. Operations support and OSS inter-working. 
         
           b. Network management, using schemes such as TNM (Total Network 
        Management), GSMP [GSMPx01], SNMP and MIB management. 
         
           c. The various types of "engineering management", including 
        performance management, availability management, security 
        management, accounting management (metering, measurements, 
        mediation, etc.) 
         
           d. Facilities management, assets and inventory management. 
         
           e. Management inter-working. 
      
     draft-amenyo-consion_00.txt        Expires February 2002     [Page 11] 
               ConSION Control & Signaling Intelligence for O.N.August 2001 
         
           f. Life cycle support (LCS) aspects and concerns, including 
        Installation, Testing and Cutover (ITC); Operational Control 
        Administration (OCA); Operations Administration and Management 
        (OAM); Maintenance and Repair Operations (MRO); and Upgrades, 
        Transitions and (tech) Migrations (UTM). 
         
           g. Various analytics in support of network management, concerned 
        involving networking oriented data warehousing and data mining. 
         
     7.3 Service Engineering Overlay Network 
         
        The aspects and concerns to be implemented in this overlay network 
        are likely to include: 
         
           a. Service provisioning for various classes of flows. These 
        classes will include differentiated, integrated and convergent 
        services and media, as well as traditional voice, data and video. 
         
           b. Issues of billing, billing mediation and inter-AD billing 
        presentment. 
         
           c. Customer care and support (CCS) and customer relationship 
        management (CRM) 
         
           d. Service-oriented business development and inter-working 
         
           e. Customer or user education, training and learning (ETL), 
        regarding I.O.N. 
         
     8  Security Considerations 
         
        Security management will be implemented primarily in the Management 
        & Administration Overlay Network. Furthermore, for each overlay 
        network, whenever flows and interactions cross AD boundaries, 
        security issues of identification, authentication, authorization, 
        delegation and gate-keeping functions will become very important. 
        ConSION based protocol suites will need to make ample provisions for 
        security and security fault tolerance. 
         
     9  Summary and Conclusions 
         
        This memo proposes that the physical SOCAR (separation of concerns, 
        aspects and roles) principle be explicitly applied to the future 
        development of protocols for optical networking (including UNI, NNI, 
        MPLS, GMPLS, "optical" MPLS, etc.)  This will be in line with the 
        emergence of the physical overlay network approach to the 
        operational deployment of optical networking infrastructures and a 
        significant role for "softswitch"-like control & signaling engines 
        and servers. 
         
        The start of the CoSION approach to protocol development will merely 
        require the careful separation of the aspects transport & 
        forwarding, control & signaling, management & administration, and

        service creation & engineering, which are all intermixed and 
        conflated in the existing protocols from the IETF, ODSI, OIF and ITU 
        (for example, for G/MPLS, UNIs and NNIs). Afterwards, the protocol 
        suites for the various overlay networks can proceed semi-
        autonomously, except for their inter-dependent touch points. 
         
        The ConSION proposal is advocating that the ideas involved in 
        logical SOCAR be taken to the ultimate conclusion by explicitly 
        formulating next generation network control and management protocol 
        suites to also support physical SOCAR. The current trend in the 
        industry shows that such physical separation is inevitable in the 
        near future, so it can be acknowledged, accommodated and used 
        systematically to drive all further relevant protocol suite 
        development in a body such as the IETF. 
         
        Once the principle of physical separation and embodiment is 
        accepted, the proposal is also advocating that open interfaces 
        should be defined within and between the overlay networks, so as to 
        allow multiple vendors to focus on their core competencies and 
        strengths so that monolithic solutions and products (both hardware 
        and software) are no longer what drive the industry. 
         
        The outlines of the general ideas of what aspects and roles belong 
        to which overlay network have also been identified. Further work is 
        needed to re-package existing protocol suites so that they allow the 
        application of the physical SOCAR principle. 
         
        With the ConSION approach each future optical networking 
        infrastructure will have its own distinct "central nervous system" 
        to coordinate, control and manage it. Furthermore the CNS of the 
        various networks will be readily and collectively inter-worked to 
        form network societies or a distributed, cooperatively intelligent 
        super-organism.
