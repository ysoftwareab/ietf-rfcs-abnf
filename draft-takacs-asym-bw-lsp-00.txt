Abstract 
    
   GMPLS provides general connection control functionality supporting 
   different network technologies. This memo specifies a further 
   generalization to support bidirectional LSPs with asymmetric 
   requirements. The extension improves the flexibility of bidirectional 
   LSP establishment and at the same time simplifies the control and 
   management of asymmetric services.

1. Introduction 
    
   RSVP-TE extensions [RFC3209] define the messages and procedures for 
   unidirectional LSP establishment for MPLS networks.  
   Per RFC3209 in order to establish a bidirectional data flow two 
   separate RSVP-TE signaling message flows are needed to set up 
   unidirectional LSPs, one in Upstream and one in Downstream direction. 
   This procedure has a number of drawbacks that will be illustrated in 
   more detail in the next section. 
    
   GMPLS RSVP-TE [RFC3473] generalizes the MPLS concept to support 
   connection control of other networking technologies, such as 
   SDH/SONET [G.707], OTN [G.709], lambda/wavelength switching, etc. 
   Since traditional connection oriented circuit switched (co-cs) 
   transport technologies (SDH/SONET) generally assume bidirectional 
   symmetrical connections, GMPLS RSVP-TE adds support for that kind of 
   connections.  Symmetrical bidirectional LSPs are supported if both 
   directions have the same traffic engineering requirements including 
   fate sharing, protection and restoration, and resource requirements 
   (e.g., bandwidth). However, in connection oriented packet switched 
   (co-ps) networks (e.g., ATM, IP/MPLS) resource availability and 
   reservation (e.g., bandwidth) are more flexible than with some 
   technologies supported by, e.g., Time-Division-Multiplexing, Lambda-
   Switching or Fiber-Switching.  Moreover some emerging new services 
   such as video applications are, with respect to bandwidth, 
   asymmetrical in nature. 
    
   To efficiently support bidirectional LSP establishment in resource 
   flexible co-ps networks while maintaining the possibility to set-up 
   LSPs in only one signaling session, the restriction of symmetrical 
   traffic engineering requirements should be relaxed. Specifically, 
   asymmetrical resource requirements (e.g., bandwidth) should be 
   supported.

2. Motivation for RSVP-TE extension 
    
   The limitation of symmetrical resource requirements may pose 
   difficulties for operators to efficiently support the services 
   foreseen for next generation networks. Examples of emerging service 
   definitions are the various Ethernet Virtual Circuits (EVCs) defined 
   by the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF). Customers can specify arbitrary 
   resource requirements between the UNIs of an EVC. For more detail see 
   [MEF.6][ETH-PARAM].  
    
   Currently, when asymmetrical bandwidth resources are required 
   operators are forced to use separate LSPs for each direction. This 
   procedure implies all the disadvantages noted in [RFC3471], and 
   restated here for the sake of clarity. 
    
   1) The latency to establish the bidirectional LSP is equal to one    
      round trip signaling time plus one initiator-terminator signaling 
      transit delay.  This not only extends the setup latency for 
      successful LSP establishment, but it extends the worst-case 
      latency for discovering an unsuccessful LSP to as much as two 
      times the initiator-terminator transit delay.  These delays are 
      particularly significant for LSPs that are established for 
      restoration purposes. 
    
   2) The control overhead is twice that of a unidirectional LSP.  This 
      is because separate control messages (e.g., Path and Resv) must 
      be generated for both segments of the bidirectional LSP. 
    
   3) Because the resources are established in separate segments, route 
      selection is complicated.  There is also additional potential 
      race for conditions in assignment of resources, which decreases 
      the overall probability of successfully establishing the 
      bidirectional connection. 
    
   4) It is more difficult to provide a clean interface for SONET/SDH 
      equipment that may rely on bidirectional hop-by-hop paths for 
      protection switching. 
    
   5) Bidirectional optical LSPs (or lightpaths) are seen as a 
      requirement for many optical networking service providers. 
    
   The need for bidirectional LSPs were raised for non PSC networks, 
   however especially the first three points are equally applicable for 
   the bidirectional asymmetric bandwidth LSPs of PSC networks as well. 
    
   Moreover, in cases where the two LSPs require symmetric routes (i.e., 
   have to traverse the same nodes and links); it is not simple to 
   assure it.  One possible way to force the two LSPs to use the same 
   path is to record the route of the first LSP using the Record Route 
 
 
Takacs et al            Expires - August 2007                [Page 3]

   object (RRO) and then use the information contained therein to fill 
   the Explicit Route object (ERO) for the second LSP. 
    
   In general the use of separate sessions complicates the management 
   and troubleshooting of the network. Means must be provided by higher 
   layer entities, e.g., the network management system (NMS), to 
   correlate the LSPs not just from RSVP-TE but also from an OAM point 
   of view. Additionally, translation functionality may be required to 
   provide operators with a service oriented bidirectional abstraction 
   hiding the complex control plane operation. 
    
   With the extension of bidirectional LSPs with support for 
   asymmetrical resource requirements, the complexity of establishing 
   and maintaining LSPs can be reduced and as a result network 
   management, fault handling and OAM will be improved. 
    
   All the above considerations do not imply that the support for the 
   set-up of an asymmetrical bidirectional LSP with two separate LSPs is 
   removed. Indeed, adding the possibility to set-up an asymmetrical LSP 
   with a single RSVP-TE message set will give to the operator the 
   maximum degree of flexibility in set-up options it can choose from 
   for a bi-bidirectional service: 
    
   A) Symmetrical case:  
         Single RSVP-TE message set with Upstream Label as per RFC 3471 
         and RFC 3473; 
    
   B) Asymmetrical with diverse routed Upstream and Downstream traffic: 
         Two independent LSPs with two RSVP-TE message sets without 
         Upstream Label 
    
   C) Asymmetrical with co-routed Upstream and Downstream traffic flow:  
         Single LSP set-up with RSVP-TE message set extended as per this 
         memo. 
 
3. Protocol extension 
    
   Only a small extension is needed to GMPLS RSVP-TE [RFC3473] to 
   support asymmetric resource requirements for bidirectional LSPs. 
     
   The current specification of RSVP-TE already supports bidirectional 
   LSPs, the fact that an LSP is bidirectional is encoded in the 
   presence of the UPSTREAM_LABEL object in the Path message [RFC 3471, 
   RFC3473].  
    
   A PATH message requesting a bidirectional LSP includes an 
   UPSTREAM_LABEL object as part of the sender description. The message 
   format according to RFC3473 is as follows.

                            <UPSTREAM_LABEL> 
    
   The SENDER_TSPEC object provides the description of the data flow for 
   the downstream direction. In order to provide means to signal 
   different traffic characteristics for the upstream direction a new 
   UPSTREAM_TSPEC object is defined that is optionally included in a 
   PATH message. If no UPSTREAM_TSPEC object is present but an 
   UPSTREAM_LABEL is specified, symmetric resource reservation should be 
   made according to the SENDER_TSPEC information following RSVP-TE 
   specifications [RFC 3471, RFC3473] without this extension.  
    
   The sender description is extended as follows. 
    
   <sender descriptor> ::=  <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC> 
                            [ <ADSPEC> ] 
                            [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ] 
                            [ <SUGGESTED_LABEL> ] 
                            [ <RECOVERY_LABEL> ]                          
                            <UPSTREAM_LABEL> 
                            [ <UPSTREAM_TSPEC> ] 
    
   For the ease of introduction into existing implementations no 
   specific position of the UPSTREAM_TSPEC object is suggested. The 
   extension does not pose any backward compatibility issue.

3.1 UPSTREAM_TSPEC object 
    
   The UPSTREAM_TSPEC has Class-Number TBA by IANA, in the form of 
   "0bbbbbbb". C-Types and formats should match the already defined C-
   Types and formats of the SENDER_TSPEC object. 
    
    
Security Considerations 
    
   RSVP message security is described in [RFC2747] and provides message 
   integrity and node authentication.  This document introduces no other 
   new security considerations. 
    
IANA Considerations 
 
   TBA.
