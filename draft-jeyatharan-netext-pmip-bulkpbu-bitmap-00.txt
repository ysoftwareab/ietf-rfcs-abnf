Internet-Draft               BulkPBU-Bitmaps                October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol (RFC-5213 [1]) allows a mobile access
   gateway (MAG) to perform a PBU on behalf of a mobile node that is
   served by the MAG.  The PBU originating from the MAG can be of
   different types such as initial registration PBU, handoff PBU, re-
   registration PBU and de-registration PBU, all representing the
   attachment state of a mobile node.  If there are numerous mobile
   nodes being served by the MAG, and each PBU associated with the
   mobile node has multiple mobility options attached, then multiple
   such PBUs originating from the MAG increases network signaling load.
   It is preferable to reduce such signaling load for better network
   operation and maintenance.

   Rather than performing a simple concatenation of multiple PBUs tied
   to multiple mobile nodes, a bulk PBU with only a single instance of a
   given mobility option type attached and an additional bitmap option
   used to locate the usage of the attached mobility option type by a
   mobile node tied to the bulk PBU is described in this draft.
   Conceptually, the bitmap is a matrix whose fields represent whether a
   particular mobility option (can be mandatory or optional mobility
   option) type is used by the mobile node that is tied to the bulk PBU.
   Since bitmaps collapse multiple instances of a given mobility option
   type (or value) to a single instance, it is considered as a
   compressed identifier of multiple mobility options and hence provides
   better optimization for bulk PBU.  The bitmap based optimization
   approach discussed in this draft is a general approach for bulk PBU
   optimization, and it can be used at any instance when bulk PBU needs
   to be sent from the MAG.

   Although the bitmap based approach described in this draft can be
   used independently to optimize signaling efficiency, it can also be
   used with other bulk PBU approaches as well.  For instance, [2]
   illustrates a PBU with MN group ID option attached that is used to
   perform either bulk re-registration or bulk de-registration of the
   mobile nodes that are grouped by a group ID.  Additionally, [3] also
   describes a similar approach which uses a bulk set ID option in the
   PBU to perform bulk re-registration of multiple mobile nodes which
   are reference by a single bulk set ID.  As will be discussed later,
   the bitmap based bulk PBU optimization approach described in this
   draft can be used together with these approaches described in [2] and
   [3].

   Section 2 describes the conventional bulk PBU optimization approach
   and bitmap based bulk PBU optimization approach.  Following that in
   Section 3, we illustrate how this bitmap based bulk PBU optimization
   approach can be combined or interwork with the MN group ID mechanism
   that is described in [2] and also briefly highlight the differences

   between the bitmap based optimization approach the MN group ID based
   optimization approach.


2.  Bulk PBU Optimization Approaches

   In this section, two bulk PBU optimization approaches are described.
   The first one is the conventional bulk PBU optimization approach or
   conventional approach and the second one is the bitmap based bulk PBU
   optimization approach.  The conventional bulk PBU optimization
   approach is mainly described to understand the benefits tied the
   bitmap approach.

2.1.  Conventional bulk PBU Approach

   The conventional way of combining multiple PBU messages for different
   mobile nodes is to have a single IPv6 header and a single PBU
   mobility header, and insert all the mobility options for each mobile
   node into the bulk PBU message.  This takes advantage of sequential
   processing of the bulk PBU message at the LMA, as if multiple
   individual PBU messages are being processed.  In such an arrangement,
   the mobility options associated with each mobile node are inserted
   into the PBU message together sequentially, with the Mobile Node
   Identifier option inserted first.  Hence, it can be treated as if the
   appearance of a Mobile Node Identifier option signals the start of
   another individual PBU (which shares the same PBU mobility header).
   For example, the bulk PBU for mobile nodes MN1 and MN2 will appears
   as follows:

       IPv6 Header
       Mobility Header
            PBU Header
       Mobility Options
            Mobile Node Identifier option for MN1
            Other mobility options for MN1
            Mobile Node Identifier option for MN2
            Other mobility options for MN2

   The main disadvantage of this approach is that although there is
   packet size savings in terms of the number of IPv6 headers and the
   number PBU mobility headers (only one IPv6 header and one PBU
   mobility header), the mobility options of the same type (or value)
   are repeated in the bulk PBU message.  For example, one of MN1's
   mobility option can be Handoff Indicator option of value "2" and the
   MN2 may also use the same Handoff Indicator option with the same
   value "2".  This may lead to the resulting bulk PBU packet size being
   too big, and thus the packet may be dropped en-route or will need to
   be broken into multiple PBU messages to overcome the path MTU.

2.2.  Bitmap based bulk PBU Approach

   The bitmap approach is such that only one mobility option of a
   certain type (or value) is attached to the bulk PBU message
   regardless of the number of mobile nodes that are tied to the
   message.  Similar to the conventional approach, the bulk PBU message
   will have only one IPv6 header and one PBU mobility header.  After
   the PBU mobility header, the mobility options will be attached.  The
   MAG will attach the union of all the mobility options used by all the
   mobile nodes tied to the bulk PBU.  To indicate the association of
   the mobility options with each mobile node, a bitmap mobility option
   will be attached in the bulk PBU.

   To better illustrate this, we assume that a bulk PBU message will
   contain registration for mobile nodes MN1, MN2 and MN3.  It is
   assumed that the mobility options for each mobile node are:

       MN1:
           Mobile Node Identifier option: MN1-ID
           Access Technology Type option: ATT1
           Home Network Prefix option: HNP=P1
           Home Network Prefix option: HNP=P2
           mobility option X
           Handoff Indicator option: HI=1
       MN2:
           Mobile Node Identifier option: MN2-ID
           Access Technology Type option: ATT2
           Home Network Prefix option: HNP=P3
           Home Network Prefix option: HNP=P4
           mobility option X
           Handoff Indicator option: HI=1
       MN3:
           Mobile Node Identifier option: MN3-ID
           Access Technology Type option: ATT2
           Home Network Prefix option: HNP=P5
           mobility option Y
           Handoff Indicator option: HI=2

   Using the bitmap approach, the resulting PBU will be:

       IPv6 Header
       Mobility Header
            PBU Header
       Mobility Options
            Mobile Node Identifier option: MN1-ID
            Mobile Node Identifier option: MN2-ID
            Mobile Node Identifier option: MN3-ID
            Home Network Prefix option: HNP=P1
            Home Network Prefix option: HNP=P2
            Home Network Prefix option: HNP=P3
            Home Network Prefix option: HNP=P4
            Home Network Prefix option: HNP=P5
            Handoff Indicator option: HI=1
            Handoff Indicator option: HI=2
            Access Technology Type option: ATT1
            Access Technology Type option: ATT2
            mobility option X
            mobility option Y
            Bitmap option = 11000101010 00110100110 00001010101

   It can be seen that for certain type and value only single mobility
   option is attached using the bitmap based approach.  For example, if
   conventional bulk PBU method of combining is used, then for HI and
   ATT, 6 mobility options will be used.  However, using the bitmap
   approach only 4 mobility options to represent HI and ATT are used in
   the bulk PBU message.  The trick lies in the Bitmap option, which
   indicates the association of each Mobile Node Identifier option with
   the other mobility options.  Figure 1 provides the illustration on
   how the association is derived from the Bitmap option.

       +=======================================================+
       |    | P1| P2| P3| P4 | P5|HI1 | HI2 | ATT1| ATT2 |X |Y |
       |----|---|---|---|----|---|----|-----|-----|------|--|--|
       | MN1| 1 |  1|  0|  0 |  0| 1  |  0  |  1  |  0   |1 |0 |
       | MN2| 0 |  0|  1|  1 |  0| 1  |  0  |  0  |  1   |1 |0 |
       | MN3| 0 |  0|  0|  0 |  1| 0  |  1  |  0  |  1   |0 |1 |
       +=======================================================+

                       Figure 1: Bitmap Illustration

   The LMA will use the bitmap shown in Figure 1 to determine the
   mobility options associated to a particular mobile node.  To obtain
   the bitmap, the LMA will use the number of mobility options that are
   not Mobile Node Identifier option in the PBU to determine the number
   of columns in the bitmap and will use the number of Mobile Node
   Identifier options to determine the number of rows.  Each row then
   contains the association information to form the binding cache entry
   for each mobile node.

3.  Synergy with other Approaches

   The bitmap approach described in this draft is a general approach of
   optimization and can work along with the mobile node group ID
   approach described in [2] and [3] as well.  Three such use cases are
   outlined below to highlight such combined usage:

   o  Use Case 1: MAG sending a bitmap based bulk PBU to LMA and
      requesting the LMA to associate the MNs to the attached MN group
      identifier(s).  For example, if there are mobile nodes MN1 and MN2
      that are going to be tied to group GID1 and mobile nodes MN3 and
      MN4 are going to be tied to group GID2, then the bitmap based bulk
      PBU message will contain a union of all the mobile nodes related
      mobility options, followed by Group Identifier options for GID1
      and GID2.  The bitmap option in the message will indicate the
      association of each mobile node to the group IDs.

   o  Use Case 2: MAG sending mobility options for multiple groups in a
      single bulk PBU.  In this case, the bitmap option can indicate the
      association of mobility options to each group (i.e. rows in the
      bitmap matrix will contain the association information for each
      group).

   o  Use Case 3: MAG sending a bulk PBU containing information
      pertaining to both groups and un-grouped mobile nodes.  Hence the
      bulk PBU will contain Mobile Node Identifier options, Group
      Identifier options, and other related mobility options.  For
      example, a bulk PBU may contain indications for newly handed over
      mobile nodes and re-registration for existing groups of mobile
      nodes.  In such a combination, the bitmap matrix rows are tied to
      the Mobile Node Identifier and Group Identifier options.

   To differentiate between the three use cases, the bitmap option can
   contain a flag to indicate whether (a) only Mobile Node Identifier
   options, (b) only Group Identifier options, or (c) both Mobile Node
   Identifier and Group Identifier options are used to as rows in the
   derived bitmap matrix.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo highlights a need for a new mobility option to carry the
   bitmap matrix and IANA needs to assign an appropriate type for it.


5.  Security Considerations

   The bitmap approach described in this memo highlights a need for a

   new mobility option which will be tied to the PBU message and thus
   the security considerations tied to PMIPv6 protocol as given in (RFC-
   5213 [1]) applies here as well.
