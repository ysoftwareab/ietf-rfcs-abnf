Internet-Draft                 PIM BSR MIB                  October 2005


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing the Bootstrap
   Router (BSR) mechanism for PIM.  [I-D.ietf-pim-sm-v2-new], [I-D.ietf-
   pim-sm-bsr].

   This draft was created by the removal of BSR MIB support from the
   draft PIM MIB [I-D.ietf-pim-mib-v2-new].  This draft contains the
   removed material, presented as a separate MIB.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58, [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   This MIB module contains four tables.  The tables are:

   1.  The BSR Candidate-RP Table, which contains one row for each
       multicast group address prefix for which the local router is to
       advertise itself as a Candidate-RP.

   2.  The BSR RP-Set Table, which contains one row for each group
       mapping that was learned via BSR.

   3.  The BSR Candidate-BSR Table, which contains Candidate-BSR
       configuration for the local router.

   4.  The BSR Elected BSR Table, which contains one row for each
       elected BSR.

   This MIB module uses textual conventions defined in the IF-MIB

5.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   TO DO

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   TO DO

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is still no control over whom on the secure network is allowed
   to access (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to access (read/change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   PIM-BSR-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is
   requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the PIM-BSR-MIB module specified
   in this document.
