0. Abstract

   This document attempts to put in perspective the use of cryptographic
   algorithms in the Simple Network Monitoring Protocol Version 3
   standard.  In particular, it notes that today's standard is
   infinitely more secure than previous versions, as the previous
   versions had zero security.  It further notes that, as cryptographic
   algorthim developments change over time, we expect that the
   recommended algorithms will change when the security community has
   reached new consensus.

1. The Current Standard is Infinitely Better

   SNMPv1 [RFC1157] and SNMPv2c [RFC1901] SNMP transmitted community
   strings, analogous to passwords, as cleartext over the internet.
   This is clearly against common sense as well as the prescription in
   [RFC2316].

   But, we also note that single-DES, as used in the SNMPv3 privacy
   protocols, is a very old cryptographic algorithm, and cryptographic
   algorithms do not improve with age [DESCRACK].  Moore's Law means
   algorithims become more vulnerable to computational attacks over
   time.  And mathematical analysis of any algorithm over time tends to
   reveal weaknesses previously missed.

2. The Standard Allows for Change

   Having the foresight to anticipate advances in cryptography, the
   SNMPv3 standard allows for future additions of new cryptographic
   algorithms, and even changes in which algorithms are mandatory to
   implement.

3. Change should be Anticipated

   While CBC single mode DES is used in the current standard, it is
   rather old and it is anticipated that the community should expect to
   see an evolution to AES or some more modern algorithm in the future.

   HMAC MD5 and HMAC SHA-1, as used in the SNMPv3 authentication
   protocols, are considered to be the state of the art at the current
   time,

4. Security Considerations

   This document is about security, specifically that of the
   cryptographic algorithms used by SNMPv3.  It notes the status and
   anticipated development of these algorithms, but is not believed to
   change the security of the SNMPv3 protocol.
