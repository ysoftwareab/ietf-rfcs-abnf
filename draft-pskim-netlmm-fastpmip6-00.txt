Abstract

   To reduce handover latency for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), this 
   document proposes an alternative fast handover mechanism where only 
   LMA exchange signaling with MAGs to set up the fast handover. That is,
   unlike existing mechanisms, inter-MAG signaling is not required in a 
   system which operates the proposed mechanism for the fast handover.

Internet-Draft    Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6    November 2007

1.  Introduction

   In recent, to reduce handover latency for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) 
   in [1], fast handover mechanisms have been dealt as shown in [2][3].

   In existing mechanisms[2][3], two relevant MAGs can exchange 
   signaling to set up the fast handover of MNs. This can require 
   these two MAGs to share an SA to protect fast handover related 
   signaling messages as shown in [4]. Therefore, for the fast 
   handover, all relevant MAGs must share an SA, independent of 
   whether or not they are geographically adjacent. This might impact 
   the amount of SA-related states on each MAG. Of course, if this is 
   not a problem, the existing mechanisms[2][3] allow MAGs to exchange 
   fast handover related signaling directly. 
   
   This document proposes an alternative fast handover mechanism for 
   PMIPv6, where only LMA exchange signaling with MAGs to set up the 
   fast handover. That is, inter-MAG signaling is not required in a 
   system which operates the proposed mechanism for the fast handover. 
   Thus, this does not require two relevant MAGs to share an SA to 
   protect fast handover related signaling messages.
   
   All the signaling messages for the fast handover between LMA and 
   MAGs can be extended from the existing Fast Handover MIPv6 (FMIPv6) 
   in [5]. 
   

2.  Terminology

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions of 
   PMIPv6[1] and FMIPv6[5], in addition to the ones specified in [2] 
   as follows:

   [BS-ID, Proxy-CoA] tuple:  Contains Proxy-CoA of an MAG and the Base
      Station (identified by BS-ID) which is attached to MAG.  The tuple
      is probably manually configured or using other mechanisms that are
      out of scope.

   PMAG:  Previous Mobile Access Gateway.  The MN's default router prior
      to its handover.  In this document, it has the same meaning as the
      Previous Access Router (PAR) of FMIPv6.

   NMAG:  New Mobile Access Gateway.  The MN's default router subsequent
      to its handover.  In this document, it has the same meaning as the 
      New Access Router (NAR) of FMIPv6.

3.  Mechanism Operations

   As shown in Figure 1, in the proposed mechanism, MAGs (PMAG and NMAG) 
   do not exchange signaling messages directly for the fast handover. 
   A MAG exchanges signaling only with the LMA, which is associated 
   with the attached MN. As a consequence, the LMA will proxy signaling 
   messages between MAGs to set up the fast handover.

   The PMAG is currently doing the mobility related signaling on behalf 
   of the MN as shown in [1]. Before the MN moves from PMAG to NMAG, 
   negotiation occurs between the MN and serving base station (BS) 
   connected to PMAG through L2 handover signaling.

   (1) When the L2 handover decision is made, the MN (or serving BS) 
       sends the PMAG L2-HO information message in which target BS-ID        
       is included. The details on L2-HO information is out of scope.

   (2) There are [BS-ID, Proxy-CoA] tuples in MAGs. Once receiving 
       L2-HO information message, the PMAG collects MN's related 
       context such as MN-Identifier, MN-HoA, MN-HNP, Proxy-CoA, MN's 
       MAC address. In addtion, the PMAG retrieves NMAG's Proxy-CoA 
       (N-Procy-CoA) from [BS-ID, Proxy-CoA] tuple. And then, the 
       PMAG sends a Fast Proxy Binding Update (FPBU) message to the LMA 
       to redirect the tunnel from the PMAG. The FPBU message contains 
       N-Proxy-CoA and MN-Identifier.

   (3) After the LMA receives FPBU message, the LMA sends Handover 
       Initiate (HI) message to NMAG where the HI message contains the 
       PMAG's Proxy-CoA (P-Proxy-CoA) and MN-Identifier.

   (4) The NMAG then sends HAck to the LMA. Once HAck is received by 
       the LMA, a bi-directional tunnel between PMAG and NMAG is 
       established, and the P-Proxy-CoA and the N-Proxy-CoA are the 
       tunnel's two ends.

   (5) Once the LMA successfully processes the HAck, the LMA sends Fast 
       Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (FPBAck) message to the PMAG.

   (6) Packets destined to the MN are tunneled from the PMAG to the 
       NMAG based on the MN-HoA. The PMAG decapsulates the packets 
       received from the tunnel to the LMA, encapsulates into tunnel
       between PMAG and NMAG, and then sends them to NMAG. The NMAG 
       buffers the packets until the link between NMAG and MN is ready.

   (7) The network access authentication is performed when MN attaches 
       to target BS connected by NMAG. When a layer 2 link is 
       established, the MN (or target BS) sends a L2-Up message 
       including target BS-ID to the NMAG. Then, the link between MN
       and NMAG is ready.

   (8) The NMAG delivers the buffered packets to the MN.

4. Message Formats

   All the messages between LMA and PMAG/NMAG can be extended simply 
   from the FMIPv6 protocol in [5].

5.  Security Considerations

   Security threats for the fast handover in network-based mobility
   management comprise the danger of unauthorized set up or redirect of
   an established forwarding path by a malicious node.  Signaling
   messages between a MAG and an LMA must be authenticated by means of 
   IPsec [6]. The use of IPsec between an LMA and a MAG follows [1].
   Protection of signaling messages between an LMA and a MAG uses the
   mechanisms of Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [7] in transport 
   mode with mandatory data origin authentication by means of a 
   non-null payload authentication algorithm. 
   In case setting up a security association between MAGs appears
   difficult, the proposed mechanism for the fast handover allows 
   secure operation without mandating such security association.
