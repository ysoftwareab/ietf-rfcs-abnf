                 BGP Security State Diagnostic Message
             draft-retana-bgp-security-state-diagnostic-00

Abstract

   This document describes an extension to the BGP Diagnostic Message to
   communicate the security state of a route.  An application of this
   extension is to propagate information about non-secure advertisements
   back to the eBGP peer from where the information was received.

Internet-Draft    BGP Security State Diagnostic Message       March 2011


1.  Introduction

   BGP Prefix Origin Validation [I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate] defines the
   interaction between BGP and a database able to map prefixes to their
   authorized ASes.  One of the potential actions resulting from an
   "invalid" route is to reject it.

   This document describes an extension to the BGP Diagnostic Message
   [I-D.raszuk-bgp-diagnostic-message] and its use to communicate
   information about these "invalid" paths.  The main motivation is to
   facilitate troubleshooting, monitoring, logging or even correction of
   the security mechanisms' operation, especially during initial
   deployment.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  The BGP Security State Diagnostic Message

   The BGP Security State Diagnostic Message is a TLV to be carried in
   the BGP Diagnostic Message and is used to communicate the local
   security state of a path.  It is defined as follows.

    0                   1                   2                   3

      This is an OPTIONAL field with variable length.


4.  Operation

   The mechanism described is intended to be primarily applied at
   autonomous system border routers.

   When a BGP speaker receives what considers to be an invalid
   advertisement it MAY send a BGP Security State Diagnostic Message to
   the eBGP peer from where it received it.  It is RECOMMENDED that a
   BGP speaker limit the number of messages sent to a specific peer over
   a given period of time and that the messages be built in such a way
   as to include as many NLRI as possible.

   A BGP speaker SHOULD also send the BGP Security State Diagnostic
   Message in response to the "Prefix specific BGP query" TLV (type 17)
   or the "Diagnostic Message Query" TLV (type 3).  The BGP Security
   State Diagnostic Message SHOULD NOT be sent periodically to a peer;
   to achieve this behavior the "Max frequency permitted" TLV (type 2)
   should be used to announce a value of 0.

   The information contained in the BGP Security State Diagnostic
   Message can then be used to diagnose and correct any potential local
   security policy violations.  Specific actions taken are outside the
   scope of this document, but could include withdrawing the original
   UPDATE or simply logging the information.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to create and maintain registries for the fields
   described in Section 3, and to assign the corresponding TLV type.


6.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism described in this document doesn't add any new security
   concerns.


7.  Acknowledgements

   The mechanism described in this document was influenced by
   discussions with Dacheng Zhang and Mingui Zhang.

   The authors would like to thank the following people for their
   comments and suggestions: Bertrand Duvivier, Keyur Patel, Roque
   Gagliano and Russ White.
