Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB),
   the network mobility support (NEMO) MIB, for use with network
   management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, the
   NEMO MIB will be used to monitor and control a mobile ipv6 node with
   NEMO functionality.

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


2.  Overview


2.1 The Mobile IPv6 Protocol and NEMO entities.

   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC3775] specifies a protocol which allows nodes
   to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet. Network
   Mobility Basic Support (NEMO) [RFC3963] is an extension to the Mobile
   IPv6 protocol which facilitates the movement of an entire network.
   The goals of Network Mobility support and related terminology are
   discussed in [NEMOGOAL] and [NEMOTERM], respectively.


   Typically mobile routers implement NEMO functionality for achieving
   network mobility. However, a mobile router may also function as a
   mobile node. In the context of this document, an entity that
   implements the NEMO protocol is a NEMO entity.


   This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used
   to monitor and control NEMO entities.

2.2 Implementation Guidance

   This document focuses on the management of a NEMO entity. The
   MIPv6MIB [10] defines the managed objects for a mobile node.
   Implementations supporting both the mobile node and NEMO
   functionality SHOULD implement the managed objects defined for the
   NEMO entities and mobile nodes from both the MIPv6MIB and NEMOMIB.

2.3 Terminology.


   The terminology used in this document is consistent with the
   definitions used in the Mobile IPv6 protocol specification[RFC3775]
   and the NEMO Basic Support specification [NEMO].


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  MIB Design


   The NEMO MIB comprises of the following primary groups:

      - nemoSystem
      - nemoConfiguration
      - nemoStats
      - nemoNotifications
      - nemoConformance

   The nemoSystem group provides the general information of the NEMO
   entity. The objects in this group cover the current home registration
   state.


   The nemoConfiguration group contains information relevant to the
   implementation and operation of the NEMO protocol.


   The nemoStats group defines the statistics related to the NEMO
   protocol operations.


   The nemoNotifications group defines the notifications generated by
   the NEMO entity in response to the operationally interesting state
   chanages in the NEMO protocol.


   The nemoConformance group identifies the managed objects that needs
   to be implemented for conforming to this draft.

5. Security Considerations



   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations. These
   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.


   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign a base arc in the mib-2 (standards track) OID tree
   for the 'nemoMIB' MODULE-IDENTITY defined in the NEMO MIB.
