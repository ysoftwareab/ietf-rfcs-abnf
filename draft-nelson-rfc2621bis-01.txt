Abstract

   This memo updates RFC 2621 by deprecating the MIB table containing
   IPv4-only address formats and defining a new table to add support for
   version neutral IP address formats.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses terminology from RFC 2866 [RFC2866].

2.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   The objects defined within this memo relate to the Remote
   Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) Accounting Server as
   defined in RFC 2866 [RFC2866].

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Scope of Changes

   This document updates RFC 2621 [RFC2621], RADIUS Accounting Server
   MIB, by deprecating the radiusAccClientTable table and adding a new
   table, radiusAccClientExtTable, containing
   radiusAccClientInetAddressType and radiusAccClientInetAddress.  The
   purpose of these added MIB objects is to support version neutral IP
   addressing formats.  The existing table containing
   radiusAccClientAddress is deprecated.

   RFC 4001 [RFC4001], which defines the SMI Textual Conventions for
   version neutral IP addresses, contains the following recommendation.

   'In particular, when revising a MIB module that contains IPv4
   specific tables, it is suggested to define new tables using the
   textual conventions defined in this memo [RFC 4001] that support all
   versions of IP.  The status of the new tables SHOULD be "current",

Internet-Draft        RADIUS Acct Server MIB (IPv6)            July 2005


   whereas the status of the old IP version specific tables SHOULD be
   changed to "deprecated".  The other approach, of having multiple
   similar tables for different IP versions, is strongly discouraged.'

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The structure of the MIB Module defined in this memo corresponds to
   the structure of the MIB Module defined in RADIUS Accounting Server
   MIB, RFC 2621 [RFC2621].  This MIB module contains thirteen scalars
   as well as a single table, the RADIUS Accounting Client Table, which
   contains one row for each RADIUS accounting client with which the
   server shares a secret.

   Each entry in the RADIUS Accounting Client Table includes twelve
   columns presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS accounting
   server.

6.  Deprecated Objects

   The deprecated table in this MIB is carried forward from RFC 2621
   [RFC2621].  There are two conditions under which it MAY be desirable
   for managed entities to continue to support the deprecated table:

   1.  The managed entity only supports IPv4 address formats.
   2.  The managed entity supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address formats,
       and the deprecated table is supported for backwards compatibility
       with older management stations.  This option SHOULD only be used
       when the IP addresses in the new table are in IPv4 format and can
       accurately be represented in both the new table and the
       deprecated table.

   Managed entities SHOULD NOT instantiate the deprecated table
   containing IPv4-only address objects when the RADIUS server address
   represented in the table row is not an IPv4 address.  Managed
   entities SHOULD NOT return inaccurate values of IP address or SNMP
   object access errors for IPv4-only address objects in otherwise
   populated tables.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires IANA assignment of a number in the MIB-2 OID
   number space.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
   SET operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information.  These are:

   radiusAccClientIPAddress This can be used to determine the address of
      the RADIUS accounting client with which the server is
      communicating.  This information could be useful in mounting an
      attack on the accounting client.
   radiusAccClientInetAddress This can be used to determine the address
      of the RADIUS accounting client with which the server is
      communicating.  This information could be useful in mounting an
      attack on the accounting client.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 do not provide a secure environment.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [RFC2574] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [RFC2575] is recommended.  Using these security
   features, customer/users can give access to the objects only to those

   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/
   create/delete) them.
