Internet-Draft               BFCP-Unreliable                  March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The motivation for using unreliable transports for BFCP [RFC4582]
   messages is fuelled by network deployments where RTP proxies are
   present for NAT and firewall traversal.  In these deployments, TCP
   may neither be applicable nor appropriate, for example, due to lack
   of support for TCP media relay or ICE-TCP [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-tcp].

   This memo extends the BFCP protocol to support unreliable transport.
   Minor changes to the transaction model are introduced in that all
   requests now have an appropriate response to complete the
   transaction.  The requests are sent with a retransmit timer
   associated with the response to achieve reliability.

   The intension is not to change the semantics of BFCP, but to present
   a trivial and workable extension that permits UDP as a transport.
   Existing implementations in the spirit of the approach detailed in
   -00 and -01 of this draft have demonstrated the approach to be
   feasible.  The purpose of this document is to formalise the
   deviations from the baseline specification enabling interoperability
   between implementations.

   The content of this draft relates to the BFCP protocol specification
   [RFC4582] and the format for the specification of BFCP streams in the
   SDP [RFC4583].  This memo is written with the goal of being
   incorporated into an upcoming revision of those documents without
   requiring additional protocol and stream specification documents.

   This draft is not recommended for adoption as an XCON working group
   item at this time owing to the outstanding work detailed in
   Section 7, but is submitted for information and discussion within the
   XCON community.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Revision of RFC4582

   This section details revisions to [RFC4582], the base protocol
   specification of BFCP.  The section number to which updates apply are
   indicated in parentheses in the titles of the sub-sections below.

3.1.  Overview of Operation (4)

   Fourth paragraph change:

      There are two types of transaction in BFCP: client-initiated
      transactions and server-initiated transactions.  Client-initiated
      transactions consist of a message from a client to the floor
      control server and a response from the floor control server to the
      client.  Correspondingly, server-initiated transactions consist of
      a message from the floor control server to a client and the
      associated acknowledgement message from the client to the floor
      control server.  Both messages can be related because they carry
      the same Transaction ID value in their common headers.

3.2.  Floor Participant to Floor Control Server Interface (4.1)

   Before seventh paragraph (page 9), insert:

      Figures 2 and 3 below show call flows for two sample BFCP
      interactions when used over reliable transport.  [Appendix A]
      (Note: here-in Section 5.16) shows the same sample interactions
      but over an unreliable transport.

3.3.  COMMON-HEADER Format (5.1)

   The figure below should replace Figure 5: COMMON-HEADER format.

   The following text preceeds "Transaction ID" on page 16:

      I: The Transaction Initiator (I) flag-bit has relevance only for
      use of BFCP over unreliable media.  When clear, it signifies that
      the transaction was opened by the client (floor participant,
      chair) and that the Transaction ID that follows has been generated
      by the client; when set, the transaction is a server-initiated
      transaction and the Transaction ID that follows is pertinent to

      the floor control server.  Where BFCP is used over reliable
      transports, the flag has no significance and SHOULD be cleared.

   Note: An alternative is that we don't actually specify bit-16 of the
   Transaction ID to be a flag per se, but define a range of Transaction
   IDs that are defined as valid for each supported transport.

   The description of Transaction ID should have the final clause
   deleted with the reference to Section 8 remaining.  The value used
   for server-initiated transactions shall be non-zero when BFCP is used
   over unreliable transports, and this qualification shall be described
   in the updated Section 8.

   The values below should be appended to the end of Table 1: BFCP
   primitives.

3.8.  Goodbye (5.3.17)

   This new subsection should be added to specify the normative ABNF for
   the new primitive, Goodbye.

      BFCP entities that wish to dissociate themselves from their remote
      participant do so through the transmission of a Goodbye.  The
      following is the format of the Goodbye message:



   Goodbye                        =    (COMMON-HEADER)

3.9.  GoodbyeAck (5.3.18)

   This new subsection should be added to specify the normative ABNF for
   the new primitive, GoodbyeAck.

      BFCP entities communicating over an unreliable transport should
      acknowledge the receipt of a Goodbye message from a peer.  The
      following is the format of the GoodbyeAck message:



   GoodbyeAck                     =    (COMMON-HEADER)

3.10.  Transport (6)

   Much of the existing text remains but demoted to become subsection
   6.1.  This draft recommends an additional behaviour for entities
   participating in communication over a reliable transport that either
   wish to leave or are asked to leave an established BFCP connection,
   as detailed in the revised section introduction text below.

   Note: The UDP fragmentation handling issue is still unfinished as it
   is felt that the document should allow a mechanism for messages that
   can grow significantly (e.g.  UserStatus) to be split into separate
   additive messages.

      The transport over which BFCP entities exchange messages depends
      on how clients obtain information to contact the floor control
      server (e.g., using an SDP pffer/answer exchange [RFC4583]).  Two

Internet-Draft               BFCP-Unreliable                  March 2010


      transports are supported: TCP, appropriate where entities can be
      sure that their connectivity is not impeded by NAT devices, media
      relays or firewalls; and UDP for those deployments where TCP may
      not be applicable or appropriate.

      If a client wishes to end its BFCP association with a floor
      control server, it is RECOMMENDED that the client send a Goodbye
      message to dissociate itself from any allocated resources.  If a
      floor control server wishes to end its BFCP association with a
      client (e.g., the Focus of the conference informs the floor
      control server that the client has been kicked out from the
      conference), it is RECOMMENDED that the floor control server send
      a Goodbye message towards the client.

3.11.  Reliable transport (6.1)

   BFCP entities may elect to exchange BFCP messages using TCP
   connections.  TCP provides an in-order reliable delivery of a stream
   of bytes.  Consequently, message framing is implemented in the
   application layer.  BFCP implements application-layer framing using
   TLV-encoded attributes.

   A client MUST NOT use more than one TCP connection to communicate
   with a given floor control server within a conference.  Nevertheless,
   if the same physical box handles different clients (e.g., a floor
   chair and a floor participant), which are identified by different
   User IDs, a separate connection per client is allowed.

   If a BFCP entity (a client or a floor control server) receives data
   that cannot be parsed, the entity MUST close the TCP connection, and
   the connection SHOULD be reestablished.  Similarly, if a TCP
   connection cannot deliver a BFCP message and times out, the TCP
   connection SHOULD be reestablished.

   The way connection reestablishment is handled depends on how the
   client obtains information to contact the floor control server.  Once
   the TCP connection is reestablished, the client MAY resend those
   messages for which it did not get a response from the floor control
   server.

   If a floor control server detects that the TCP connection towards one
   of the floor participants is lost, it is up to the local policy of
   the floor control server what to do with the pending floor requests
   of the floor participant.  In any case, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   floor control server keep the floor requests (i.e., that it does not
   cancel them) while the TCP connection is reestablished.

   To maintain backwards compatability with older implementations of

   [RFC4583], BFCP entities MUST interpret the graceful close of their
   TCP connection from their associated participant as an implicit
   Goodbye message.

3.12.  Unreliable transport (6.2)

   BFCP entities may elect to exchange BFCP messges using UDP datagrams.
   UDP is an unreliable transport where neither delivery nor delivery
   order is assured.  At most one BFCP message shall be conveyed per
   datagram.  The message format for exchange of BFCP in UDP datagrams
   is the same as for a TCP stream above.

   Clients MUST announce their presence to the floor control server by
   tranmission of a Hello message.  This Hello message MUST be responded
   to with a HelloAck message and only upon receipt can the client
   consider the floor control service as present and available.

   As described in [Section 8], each request sent by a floor participant
   or chair shall form a client transaction that expects an
   acknowledgement message back from the floor control server within a
   retransmission window.  Concordantly, messages sent by the floor
   control server that are not transaction-completing (e.g.  FloorStatus
   announcements as part of a FloorQuery subscription) are server-
   initiated transactions that require acknowledgement messages from the
   floor participant and chair entities to which they were sent.

   If a BFCP entity receives data that cannot be parsed, the receiving
   participant MAY send an Error message with parameter value 10
   indicating receipt of a malformed message.  If the message can be
   parsed to the extent that it is able to discern that it was a
   response to an outstanding request transaction, the client MAY
   discard the message and await retransmission.  BFCP entities
   receiving an Error message with value 10 SHOULD acknowledge the error
   and act accordingly.

   Transaction ID values are non-sequential and entities are at liberty
   to select values at random.  Entities MUST only have at most one
   outstanding request transaction at any one time.  Implicit
   subscriptions, such as FloorRequest messages that have multiple
   responses as the floor control server processes intermediate states
   until Granted or Denied terminal states attained, can be
   characterised by a client-initiated request transaction whose
   acknowledgement is implied by the first FloorRequestStatus response
   from the floor control server.  The subsequent changes in state for
   the request are new transactions whose Transaction ID is determined
   by the floor control server and whose receipt by the client
   participant shall be acknowledged with a FloorRequestStatusAck
   message.

   By restricting participants to having at most one pending transaction
   open, the out-of-order receipt of messages is mitigated.  A server-
   initiated request (e.g., a FloorStatusRequest with an update from the
   floor control server) received by a participant before the initial
   FloorRequestStatus message that closes the client-initiated
   transaction that was instigated by the FloorRequest clearly
   supercedes the information conveyed in the delinquent response.  As
   the floor control server cannot send a second update to the implicit
   floor status subscription until the first is acknowledged, ordinality
   is maintained.

   BFCP entities SHOULD ensure that their messages are smaller than the
   recommended MTU size of 1300 bytes when encoded to minimise
   likelihood of fragmentation en route to their peer entity.

   If a BFCP entity receives an ICMP port unreachable message mid-
   conversation, the entity SHOULD treat the conversation as closed
   (e.g., an implicit Goodbye message from the peer) and behave
   accordingly.  The entity MAY attempt to re-establish the conversation
   afresh.  The new connection will appear as a wholly new floor
   participant, chair or floor control server with all state previously
   held about that participant lost.

   Note: This is because the peer entities cannot rely on IP and port
   tuple to uniquely identify the participant, nor would extending Hello
   to include an attribute that advertised what the entity previously
   was assigned as a User ID be acceptable due to session hijacking.

   In deployments where NAT appliances, firewalls or other such devices
   are present and affecting port reachability for each entity, peer
   connectivity checks, relay use and NAT pinhole maintenance SHALL be
   achieved through the mechanisms defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice].

   For review in future revisions of this draft, per Section 7.


5.  Protocol Transactions (8)

   The final clause of the introduction to section 8 shall be changed to
   read:

      Since they do not trigger any response, their Transaction ID is
      set to 0 when used over reliable transports, but must be non-zero
      and unique in the context of outstanding transactions over
      unreliable transports.

      When using BFCP over unreliable transports, all requests will use
      retransmit timer T1 (see Section 5.2) until the transaction is
      completed.

5.1.  Server Behavior (8.2)

   The final clause of this section shall be changed to read:

      Server-initiated transactions MUST contain a Transaction ID equal
      to 0 when BFCP is used over reliable transports.  Over unreliable
      transport, the Transaction ID shall have the same properties as
      for client-initiated transactions: the server MUST set the
      Transaction ID value in the common header to a number that is
      different from 0 and that MUST NOT be reused in another message
      from the server until the appropriate response from the client is
      received for the transaction.  The server uses the Transaction ID
      value to match this message with the response from the floor
      participant or floor chair.

5.2.  Timers (8.3)

   New section:

      When BFCP entities are communicating over an unreliable transport,
      two retransmission timers are employed to help mitigate against
      loss of datagrams.  Retransmission and response caching are not
      required when BFCP entities communicate over reliable transports.

5.2.1.  Request retransmission timer, T1 (8.3.1)

   T1 is a timer that schedules retransmission of a request until an
   appropriate response is received or until the maximum number of
   retransmissions have occurred.  The timer doubles on each re-
   transmit, failing after three unacknowledged transmission attempts.

   If a valid respone is not received for a client- or server-initiated
   transaction, the implementation MUST consider the BFCP association as
   failed.  Implementations SHOULD follow the reestablishment procedure
   described in section 6 (e.g. initiate a new offer/answer [RFC3264]
   exchange).  Alternatively, they MAY continue without BFCP and
   therefore not be participant in any floor control actions.

5.2.2.  Response retransmission timer, T2 (8.3.2)

   T2 is a timer that, when fires, signals that the BFCP entity can
   release knowledge of the transaction against which it is running.  It
   is started upon the first transmission of the response to a request
   and is the only mechanism by which that response is released by the

   BFCP entity.  Any subsequent retransmissions of the same request can
   be responded to by replaying the cached response, whilst that value
   is retained until the timer has fired.

   T2 shall be set such that it encompasses all legal retransmissions
   per T1 plus a factor to accommodate network latency between BFCP
   entities.

5.2.3.  Timer values (8.3.3)

   The table below defines the different timers required when BFCP
   entities communicate over an unreliable transport.

        +-------+--------------------------------------+---------+
        | Timer | Description                          | Value/s |
        +-------+--------------------------------------+---------+
        |   T1  | Initial request retransmission timer |   0.5s  |
        |   T2  | Response retransmission timer        |   10s   |

6.  Revision of RFC4583

   This section details revisions to [RFC4583], the format for
   specifying BFCP streams.  The section number to which updates apply
   are indicated in parentheses in the titles of the sub-sections below.

6.1.  Fields in the 'm' Line (3)

   The section shall be re-written to remove reference to the
   exclusivity of TCP as a transport for BFCP streams.

   1.  In paragraph four, "... will initiate its TCP connection ..."
       becomes "... will direct BFCP messages ..."

   2.  In paragraph four, delete "Since BFCP only runs on top of TCP,
       the port is always a TCP port."

   3.  In paragraph five, we now define three new values for the
       transport field, adding "UDP/BFCP" as the third symbol, changing
       "former" for "first", "latter" for "second", and adding a final
       clause defining the use of UDP/BFCP as being for when BFCP runs
       on top of UDP

6.2.  Security Considerations (10)

   At this time, see Section 7.

6.3.  Registration of SDP 'proto' values (11.1)

   This section should be renamed now that there are more values to
   register in the SDP parameters registry, with the following added to
   the table:

                         +----------+-----------+
                         | Value    | Reference |
                         +----------+-----------+
                         | UDP/BFCP | RFC[XXXX] |
                         +----------+-----------+

                 Table 6: Value for the SDP 'proto' field


7.  Future work

   This draft reflects a work in progress, with at least the following
   items to be documented and/or revised before soliciting adoption by
   the XCON working group:

   Secured transport  Initial investigation has highlighted that the
         previously recommended approach of re-using Hello and HelloAck
         messages to open and maintain NAT pinholes is inadequate when
         considering the adoption of DTLS as a transport security
         mechanism.  However, at this time insufficient work has been
         done to confirm DTLS as a recommendation, particularly as



Thompson, et al.        Expires September 3, 2010              [Page 20]

Internet-Draft               BFCP-Unreliable                  March 2010


         regards signaling DTLS roles, key exchange, etc.  It is likely
         that [I-D.ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework] will inform this
         investigation.

   Protocol revision  Certain aspects of this draft require different
         behaviors depending on whether a reliable or unreliable
         transport is being used, e.g. server-initiated transactions
         having Transaction ID 0 over reliable transports without
         acknowledgements versus non-zero and active-unique with an
         acknowledgement message when entities communicate over
         unreliable transports.  If we allow TCP-based implementations
         to follow the graceful-close behaviour of [RFC4582] without
         mandating that the Goodbye message be signaled then it would
         not be necessary to bump the protocol version number.  TCP-
         based implementations could continue as-is, whilst UDP-based
         implementations would be at their first version and as such no
         backward compatible issues would be present.

   Fragmentation  It has been observed that BFCP message structures can
         grow to be sufficiently large that they exceed the typical MTU
         threshold for local area networks (assumed here as 1500
         octets).  For example, a FloorStatus message with multiple
         FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attributes that contain detailed
         STATUS-INFO in the OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS and FLOOR-REQUEST-
         STATUS attributes.  A strategy for coping with such fragmented
         messages is required.  Currently, this is held with a broad-
         sweeping statement of intent that implementations should
         restrict the size of their messages.  Further refinement is
         likely required, such as an applicability statement on those
         BFCP messages and/or attributes deemed as inappropriate for use
         over transports where fragmentation is a concern, or further
         protocol specification to eradicate fragmentation as an issue.

   Example signaling flows  The next revision of this draft will include
         further example signaling exchanges over unreliable transport
         showing updated transactions and message retransmission as a
         visual aid and reference for implementors.

Appendix A.  Changes to previous drafts

A.1.  -01 to -02

   1.  Stepped away from changing semantics and directionality of Hello
       and HelloAck messages for pinhole establishment and keep-alive in
       favour of ICE toolset, particularly as this would have not
       resolved connectivity establishment as a precursor to deployment
       of DTLS [RFC4347] as a transport security mechansim.

   2.  Change to COMMON-HEADER to reserve bit-16 of Transaction ID to
       show originator of transaction such that request/response and
       response/acknowledgement mapping can be maintained without
       colliding randomly chosen Transaction IDs.  This also avoids a
       three-way handshake scenario around FloorRequest where the
       implicit acknowledgement (in FloorRequestStatus) might also be
       interpreted as a transaction openening request on the part of the
       floor control server.

   3.  Defined additional timer (T2) to soak up lost responses without
       additional processing.

   4.  Restricted outstanding transactions to only one in-flight per
       direction at any one time to mitigate re-ordering issues.

   5.  Defined entity behaviour when transactions timeout.

   6.  Specified initial suggestion for how to minimise fragmentation of
       messages.

   7.  Removed consideration of TCP-over-UDP after internal review.

   8.  Re-stated DTLS as likely preferred mechanism of securing
       transport, although this investigation is on-going.

A.2.  -00 to -01

   1.  Refactored to a format that represents explicit changes to base
       RFCs.

   2.  Introduction of issues currently under investigation that
       preclude adoption.

   3.  Specified retransmission timer for requests.
