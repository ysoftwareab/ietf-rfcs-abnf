                   DNS Copyright and License prefixes
               draft-wallstrom-dnsop-copyright-prefix-00

Abstract

   The content of a typical zone file is lacking information on the
   copyright and license from which the content of the zone file is
   available.  The typical use is to make a zone file available after an
   agreement on use (license) has been made.  When the zone file is
   publicly available through DNS, there is no way of signalling the
   copyright ownership or any end user license of the content.  This
   document describes two prefixes for handling this using the TXT RR
   type, _copyright and _license.

1.  Introduction

   A zone file is typically not available to an end user in its
   entirety, but rather accessed only through DNS lookups.  AXFR and
   other methods for accessing the complete content of the zone file is
   often prohibited.

   For clients and applications that wish to use the zone file for
   purposes other than DNS lookups, adding the copyright and license
   information to the zone file itself is useful.

   This document describes two prefixes for handling this using the TXT
   RR type, _copyright and _license.  A client that looks up these
   records in a zone can determine the copyright owner and the license
   of the content of a zone.

   The use of an underscore prefix is based on the work on
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-attrleaf].

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The _copyright prefix

   The _copyright record is published in the zone using the DNS TXT
   resource record type.

   The RDATA for the _copyright resource record is textual in format
   using the following template:

   copyright IN TXT "Copyright (C) YEAR Your Name or Organization"

   The copyright applies to the specific zone of where the _copyright
   TXT RR is found.  The copyright itself is a sui generis database
   right that covers the complete zone content, or larger portions of it
   where this type of copyright law applies.

3.  The _license prefix

   The _license record is published in the zone using the DNS TXT
   resource record type.

   The RDATA for the _license resource record is textual in format and
   is a HTTP URL leading to the full license text represented in either
   plain text or HTML.  Example:

   license IN TXT "https://www.example.com/license.txt"

4.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations (yet).

5.  IANA Considerations

   The prefixes described in this document might be published by the
   IANA registry described in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-attrleaf].
