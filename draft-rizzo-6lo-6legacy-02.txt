                    IPv6 mapping to non-IP protocols
                       draft-rizzo-6lo-6legacy-02

Abstract

   IPv6 is an important enabler of the Internet of Things, since it
   provides an addressing space large enough to encompass a vast and
   ubiquitous set of sensors and devices, allowing them to interconnect
   and interact seamlessly.  To date, an important fraction of those
   devices is based on networking technologies other than IP.  An
   important problem to solve in order to include them into an
   IPv6-based Internet of Things, is to define a mechanism for assigning
   an IPv6 address to each of them, in a way which avoids conflicts and
   protocol aliasing.

   The only existing proposal for such a mapping leaves many problems
   unsolved and it is nowadays inadequate to cope with the new scenarios
   which the Internet of Things presents.  This document defines a
   mechanism, 6TONon-IP, for assigning automatically an IPv6 address to
   devices which do not support IPv6 or IPv4, in a way which minimizes
   the chances of address conflicts, and of frequent configuration
   changes due to instability of connection among devices.  Such a
   mapping mechanism enables stateless autoconfiguration for legacy
   technology devices, allowing them to interconnect through the
   Internet and to fully integrate into a world wide scale, IPv6-based
   IoT.

2.  Introduction

   The Future Internet and the IPv6 protocol enable a new generation of
   techniques for accessing the network, which extend the Internet
   seamlessly to personal devices, sensors, home appliances, enabling
   the so called ''Internet of Things'' (IoT).  One of the key issues
   which presently hampers the development of IoT and limits its
   potential is the lack of an efficient common framework for the
   integration among the vast and diverse set of protocols and
   technologies which compose it.  Current sensors and their application
   environments employ a large set of technologies which lack efficient
   interoperability.  Some associations of manufacturers have been
   formed to build a common technological framework in specific
   application domains, e.g.  KNX for building automation
   (http://www.knx.org/), ZigBee (ZigBee Alliance)
   (http://www.zigbee.org/), and protocols such as X10 and CAN.  Such
   frameworks are based on very different architectures, and the
   protocols which compose them are generally not interoperable.
   Finally, most of these technologies were designed in a context of
   small and local networks, with limited capabilities, and they were
   not conceived for integration within the Internet.  One of the ideas
   at the basis of the IoT is the constitution of a common set of
   protocols which enables the interaction between devices through the
   Internet.  By enabling interaction through the Internet, new services
   could be conceived and implemented, increasing the value produced by
   the IoT infrastructure.  The adoption of a common framework may make
   more economically convenient its deployment, and foster the
   development of new smart environments (buildings, cities, etc),
   ultimately making possible the full realization of the potential of
   the IoT.  As deployment of new sensors is typically expensive, it is
   unthinkable of putting to disuse an installed set of sensors, once a
   new set of devices (typically, IPv6 enabled) is deployed.  This is
   not an uncommon case, as the set of deployed legacy devices (sensors,
   actuators) is to date very large.  Rather, mechanisms are needed to
   integrate legacy devices into a common IoT platform, in order to
   include them in all the present and future services (e.g. devices and
   services directory, localization services, etc) which will be
   implemented on the IoT.  For these reasons, many designers of the
   Internet of Things are focusing on building such common access and
   communications framework.  All the proposals (e.g.  CoAP, RESTful Web
   services) presently under discussion are based on IPv6.  This has
   important implications on the addressing of the devices.  Indeed a

   common addressing at the device level is mandatory, in order to
   implement true Machine to Machine (M2M) communications without Portal
   Servers, which would make the whole system difficult to integrate and
   scale.  The present document focuses on the network layer aspects of
   such IPv6 based integration.  At the network layer, a mechanism which
   assigns an IPv6 address to each device is needed, to solve the
   addressing problem.  In this document, we propose a new mechanism for
   the users and devices to map the different addressing spaces to a
   common IPv6 one.  Our proposed mechanism solves several issues posed
   by some of the mappings adopted so far.  Such mapping makes it
   possible for every device from each technology to operate through a
   common framework based on IPv6 and protocols over IPv6 such as
   RESTFul WebServices and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).  For
   each technology, the proposed mechanism maps technology-specific
   features to a set of fields defined within the IPv6 address.  This
   allows the location and identification of the devices in a multi-
   protocol card, or in any gateway or Portal Server.

2.1.  Examples

   In this subsection, we present two examples which help understanding
   the importance of adopting a common IPv6 based framework for
   interaction between things, and the need for legacy devices to be
   individually addressable through IPv6.

2.1.1.  Example 1 - Building automation systems and IoT

   The IoT is composed by a very large set of devices, which is poised
   to grow exponentially in the near future.  For this reason, a
   directory service is needed, which offers the possibility to
   individuate a specific device or set of devices, with given
   capabilities or within a given geographical region.  Let us assume
   such directory lists devices with their IPv6 addresses, and their
   function (say a temperature sensor, or a mobile phone, etc).  For
   instance, let us consider the case of someone willing to build a map
   of temperatures in a given geographical region.  Such directory
   service would allow retrieving the list of available devices within
   that region, each with its own IPv6 address.  Assume some of those
   devices are legacy, non IP based temperature sensors and part of a
   given building automation system.  Assume also that such system
   manages several of those temperature sensors.  Even if such system
   would be reachable via IP, without having those sensors individually
   listed in the directory and appearing as ''autonomous'' things, which
   can be polled directly, one should resort to techniques for
   retrieving the temperature reading of those sensors which are
   specific of that building automation technology.  This would make
   more complex the implementation of such a temperature map.

Internet-Draft                  6TONon-IP                 September 2014


   Instead, by having the building automation system expose each sensor
   as an IPv6 enabled device, the whole set of temperature sensors would
   be accessible in a homogeneous way, greatly simplifying the task.

2.1.2.  Example 2 - KNX and demand-side management

   KNX is a standardized (EN 50090, ISO/IEC 14543), OSI-based network
   communications protocol for intelligent buildings.  Among the devices
   typically managed through KNX, we find:

   o  Lighting control systems;

   o  Heating/ventilation and air conditioning devices;

   o  Shutter/blind and shading control systems; and

   o  Energy management and electricity/gas/water metering devices.

   KNX devices do not support IP.  Therefore, in order to connect a KNX
   home network to the Internet, a gateway (KNXnet/IP router) is
   necessary.  Other technologies for home automation are available
   nowadays, in which each smart device (air conditioners, washing
   machines, etc) supports IPv6.  Let us consider a scenario in which an
   utility company offers an agreement to a fraction of its clients.  In
   exchange for a cut on the energy bill, the utility company gains
   direct control over some appliances at the premises of the client.
   In this way, by powering off some of those devices in periods when
   the production cost of power are very high, the utility company
   realizes potentially high savings.

   In order to implement this, the utility company sends commands to a
   set of devices under its direct control.  For recently installed
   devices, the utility can assume that they support IPv6, and some
   application layer protocols such as CoAP.  Therefore a command to
   switch off a device would use the IPv6 address to identify the
   device, and the application layer protocol to send the actual
   command.  But for KNX devices, the command should have another
   format: the IPv6 address should be the one of the router bridging the
   IPv6 and the KNX networks, and upper layers protocols should take
   care of identifying the specific device inside the KNX home network
   to whom the command should be sent.  Having to format a specific
   query for each specific home automation protocol adds a level of
   complexity which translates into higher costs of implementation and
   maintenance of such a service.

3.  Reference System

   In this section we describe a reference system where the IPv6 mapping
   is used.  Such a system includes:

   1.  A set of networks running non-IPv6-compatible technologies, each
       with one or more hosts connected.  Such networks generally use
       different OSI layer 3 protocols, or they may adopt a technology
       which does not have any layer 3 protocol.

   2.  A proxy, which hosts the IPv6 mapping functionality.  Such device
       is typically connected to each of the legacy protocols networks,
       and it accesses the Internet via the IPv6 protocol.  Such IPv6
       addressing proxy performs all the necessary conversions and
       adaptations between IPv6 and the (local) networking protocol of
       the legacy technologies, in a way which depends on the specific
       legacy technology considered.  This proxy makes use of the IPv6
       mapping mechanism in order to transforms the native addressing to
       IPv6 Host ID and vice versa in a way that depends on the legacy
       technology.

   Though in what follows we will describe the proposed mapping with
   reference to such a system, the main ideas behind it are more
   general, and they apply to settings others than the one of reference
   presented here.

4.  Issues addressed through the 6TONon-IP mapping mechanism

   In this section we highlight the main open issues regarding
   assignment of IPv6 addresses to devices which do not support IPv6 or
   IPv4, and we describe a set of desirable properties for a mechanism
   for automatic assignment of IPv6 addresses to such devices, which we
   name henceforth 6TONon-IP.  In Appendix A of RFC 4291, a method is
   described for creating modified EUI-64 format Interface Identifiers
   out of links or nodes with IEEE EUI-64 Identifiers, or with IEEE 802
   48-bit MACs.  Moreover, for technologies having other link layer
   interface identifier, some possible mapping methods are sketched,
   leaving for each legacy protocol the possibility to define its own
   mapping method.

   In the present document, we propose a mapping mechanism which enables
   stateless address autoconfiguration for legacy technologies, and
   which exploits some protocol specific identifier such as link layer
   interface identifiers, and the like.  The proposed mapping mechanism
   addresses the following issues:

   1.  Protocol identification: For the legacy protocols to which the
       mapping described in RFC 4291 does not apply, a mechanism is



Rizzo, Ed., et al.       Expires March 29, 2015                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  6TONon-IP                 September 2014


       needed to map an IPv6 address to the right legacy protocol.  This
       feature is necessary in case of devices which operate as proxy
       for more than one legacy technology at the same time.

   2.  Inter protocol aliasing: Without a mechanism for identifying the
       legacy protocol from the host part of the IPv6 address, address
       conflicts are possible among devices belonging to different
       legacy protocols.  For instance, this may happen when the link
       layer interface identifier is the same for two devices belonging
       to different technologies.  As several legacy technologies are
       characterized by a small addressing space, address conflicts are
       not so unlikely.

   3.  Conflicts between IPv6 mapped legacy technology addresses and
       addresses derived from (modified or not) EUI-64 format interface
       identifiers.

   4.  Intra-protocol aliasing: As several legacy technologies are
       characterized by a small addressing space, it is not unlikely to
       have two legacy devices, mapped to IPv6 addresses with the same
       network ID (for instance, in the case in which they belong to two
       separate networks of the same technology, both connected to a
       same proxy), and with a same interface identifier, and mapping
       therefore to a same IPv6 address.

   Moreover, the following is a list of desirable properties for a
   6TONon-IP mapping:

   1.  Consistency: A host should get the same IPv6 address every time
       it connects to a same legacy network, assuming that the
       configuration of all the other devices in that network remains
       unchanged.  This allows avoiding to advertise a new address every
       time the host reconnects.  This feature might be particularly
       important for devices which are not always "on", or which are not
       permanently connected.

   2.  Local Uniqueness: For devices which have an IPv6 address with a
       same network part, the host part should be unique for each host.
       This property allows avoiding address conflicts.

   3.  Uniqueness within the whole Internet: Coherently with the IoT
       vision, the host part of an IPv6 address associated to a host
       should be unique within the whole Internet.

   Depending on the specific legacy protocol, there might be protocol
   specific limitations to the satisfaction of these properties.  In
   particular, for those protocols which do not have an interface
   identifier which is unique, properties 1) and 2) cannot be fully



Rizzo, Ed., et al.       Expires March 29, 2015                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  6TONon-IP                 September 2014


   satisfied.  Indeed, no mapping can solve address conflicts which take
   place inside a legacy protocol network.  When legacy protocols have a
   interface identifier which is unique, this can be used to produce a
   unique host part of an IPv6 address, and its uniqueness would
   guarantee the satisfaction of properties 1), 2) and 3).

5.  6TONon-IP Mapping Method

   In this section we describe the proposed strategy for forming IPv6
   addresses from legacy protocol information, and the address format
   that derives from it.  We assume that (one or more) 64 bits Network
   ID prefixes are given to the mapping function, which therefore
   computes the 64 bits of the Host ID part of the address (IPv6
   interface identifier), in order to form a full IPv6 address.

   The input of the proposed mapping function consists in the interface
   identifier of the legacy protocol.

   In the proposed mapping method, the resulting Host ID part (IPv6
   interface identifier) is composed by six fields, as shown in
   Figure 1:

   o  A Technology ID field (11 bits), containing a code which
      identifies the specific legacy protocol.  This field is split into
      two parts, one of 6 bits, and another of 5 bits.

   o  U/L bit (1 bit), in order to keep compatibility with the mapping
      EUI-64 [RFC4291].  The U/L bit is the seventh bit of the first
      byte and is used to determine whether the address is universally
      or locally administered.  This bit is set to "0", in order to
      indicate local scope, analogously to what proposed in [RFC4291].
      This choice prevents address conflicts with IPv6 interface
      identifier generated from IEEE EUI-64 identifiers or IEEE 48-bit
      MAC identifiers.

   o  A Reserved field (4 bits).  This field can be used in the future
      for the identification of different interfaces for a same
      technology (in the same subnetwork).

   o  Technology Mapping field (32 bits), which maps the interface
      identifier of the legacy protocol.  For those protocols for which
      the IID is not larger than 32 bits, this field contains the 32
      bits of the IID.  For IID which are larger than 32 bits, a hashing
      function is used instead of direct mapping.  In particular, some
      hashing algorithms such as CRC-32 are suggested.  Hashing
      satisfies the requirements of consistency and uniqueness within a
      subnet with a very high probability, which depends on the hashing

      algorithm used.  This field is split into two parts, one of 8
      bits, and another of 24 bits.

   o  The fourth and fifth bytes are both set to to "0x00", in order not
      to conflict with EUI-64 interface identifiers.

   The resulting format of the Host ID part of the IPv6 address obtained
   from the mapping is indicated in Figure 1.

6.  Examples

   In this section we illustrate the proposed mapping method by applying
   it on some examples.

6.1.  Example 1 - EIB/KNX

   We assume the legacy protocol is EIB/KNX.  This device has two kind
   of addresses: On the one hand, a logical address for management of
   group operations, and on the other hand, an individual address for
   identification of the device in the topology.

   The mapping will be focused for the individual address.  This
   includes an Area ID (4 bits), Line ID (8 bits), and Device ID (8
   Bits).  An example, is the value 0x1/0x01/0x01 for a sensor connected
   in the Area ID 0x1, Line ID 0x01, and Device ID 0x01.

   We apply a hash (CRC-32) to the sequence 0x10101.  The result is
   0xDEA258A5.

   Let us assume that EIB/Konnex Technology ID is "0".  Thereby, the
   IPv6 interface identifier is "0000:DE00:00A2:58A5", considering the
   documentation network 2001:db8::/32.  The final IPv6 address for the
   legacy device is "2001:db8::DE00:A2:58A5".

   The address is presented in the Figure 2.

6.2.  Example 2 - RFID

   We assume the legacy protocol is RFID.  Each RFID device is
   identified by its Electronic Product Code (EPC), whose length may
   vary from 96 to 256 bits.  Let us assume to have an RFID device whose
   EPC is given by 01.23F3D00.8666A3.000000A05 (12 bytes).  Let us
   assume that the RFID technology ID is "1".

   We apply a hash (CRC-32) to the sequence 0x0123F3D008666A3000000A05.
   The result is 0xA93AFFA0.

   Thereby, the IPv6 interface identifier is "0004:A900:003A:FFA0",
   considering the documentation network 2001:db8::/32.  The final IPv6
   address for the RFID tag is "2001:db8::400:A900:3A:FFA0".

   The address is presented in the Figure 2.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Not yet defined.

8.  Security considerations

   The proposed mapping mechanism, being based on mapping proprietary
   protocol ID, results in such ID being incorporated in the final IPv6
   address, exposing this piece of information to the Internet.  The
   concern has been that a user might not want to expose the details of
   the system to outsiders.  For such concern, which holds also for MAC
   address mapping into EUI64 addresses, please refer to appendix B in
   [RFC4942].
