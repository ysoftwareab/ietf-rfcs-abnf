Abstract

   This document describes a way to perform the mapping between two
   signalling protocols: SIP and ISUP.

General comment

   This is a very preliminary version of this draft. It intends to get
   feedback and opinions about 'SIP to ISUP mapping' related issues.

1. Introduction

   SIP [1] is an application layer protocol for establishing,
   terminating and modifying multimedia sessions. It is typically
   carried over IP. Telephone calls are considered a type of
   multimedia sessions where just audio is exchanged.

   ISUP [2] is a level 4 protocol used in SS7 networks. It typically
   runs over MTP although it will run also over IP (work in progress,
   IETF SIGTRAN working group). ISUP is used for controlling telephone
   calls and for maintenance of the network (blocking circuits,
   resetting circuits etc.).

   The module performing the mapping between these two protocols is
   usually referred to as Media Gateway Controller (MGC). It has
   logical interfaces towards both networks, the network carrying ISUP
   and the network carrying SIP, although usually they are on the same
   physical interface. The MGC also has capabilities for controlling
   the voice path. There is typically a Media Gateway (MG) with E1/T1
   interfaces (voice from PSTN) and with IP interfaces (VoIP). The MGC
   and the MG can be merged together in one physical box or kept
   separate.

2. Scope

   This document only takes into account the call control
   functionality of ISUP. Maintenance messages are outside the scope
   of this document.

   There are several flavours of ISUP. ITU-T Q.767 International ISUP
   [2] is used through this document and some differences with ANSI
   ISUP [3] are outlined. ISUP Q.767 [2] was chosen because is the
   least complex of all the ISUP flavours. Once the mapping between
   this flavour of ISUP and SIP is clear, mapping from other flavours
   to SIP will be easier to resolve.

   This document describes when the media path has to be initialized,
   terminated, modified, etc, but it does not go into details such as
   how the initialization is performed or which protocol are used for
   that purpose.

3. Scenarios

   There are several scenarios where ISUP-SIP mapping takes place. The
   way the messages are generated is different depending on the
   scenario.

   When there is a single MGC and the call is from a SIP phone to a
   PSTN phone, or vice versa, the MGC generates the ISUP messages
   based on the methods described in this document.

   +-------------+       +-----+       +-------------+
   | PSTN switch +-------+ MGC +-------+ SIP UAC/UAS |
   +-------------+       +-----+       +-------------+

   The scenario where a call originates in the PSTN, goes into a SIP
   network and terminates in the PSTN again is known as "SIP bridging".
   SIP bridging should provide ISUP transparency between the PSTN
   switches handling the call. This is achieved by carrying the
   incoming ISUP messages in the body of the SIP messages [4],[8]. In
   this case, the ISUP messages generated by the egress MGC are the
   ones present in the SIP body.

   +------+   +-------------+   +-----+   +------------+   +------+
   | PSTN +---+ Ingress MGC +---+ SIP +---+ Egress MGC +---+ PSTN |
   +------+   +-------------+   +-----+   +------------+   +------+

   In both scenarios, the ingress MGC places the incoming ISUP messages
   in the SIP body by default. If the recipient of these messages
   (typically a SIP UAC/UAS) does not understand them a negotiation
   using the SIP 'Accept' and 'Require' headers will take place and
   they will not be included in the next SIP message exchange.

   Eventually there can be a Signalling Gateway (SG) between the PSTN
   and the MGC. It encapsulates the ISUP messages over IP. The mapping
   described in this document is not affected by its presence.

4. Require extensions

   For a correct mapping between ISUP and SIP, some extensions to the
   basic SIP specification are needed. They are defined in [5]. If the
   SIP UAC/UAS involved in the call does not support them it is still
   possible to proceed, but the behaviour in the establishment of the
   call may be slightly different to the one expected by the user
   (other party answers before receiving the ringback tone, user is not
   informed about the call being forwarded, etc.).

5. Mapping

   The mapping between ISUP and SIP is described using two state
   machines. One handles calls from SIP to ISUP and the second from
   ISUP to SIP. There are details, such as some retransmissions and
   some states when the call is being disconnected (waiting for RLC,
   waiting for ACK etc.), that are not shown in the figures in order to
   make them easier to follow.

   The boxes represent the different states of the gateway, and the
   arrows show changes in the state. The event that triggers the change
   in the state and the actions to take appear on the arrow:

   event / section describing the actions to take

   For example, 'INVITE / 6.1' indicates that an INVITE request has
   been received by the gateway, and the procedure upon reception is
   described in the section 6.1 of this document.

6.1 INVITE request received

   When an INVITE request is received by the gateway, a "100 Trying"
   response is sent back to the SIP network indicating that the MGC is
   handling of the call.

   The resources for the media stream have to be reserved at this
   stage, since an IAM message cannot be sent before the resource
   reservation takes place. Typically the resources consist of a time
   slot in an E1/T1 and an RTP/UDP port on the IP side. Before sending
   the IAM the MG gets backward through connected.

   An ISUP IAM is sent. The mandatory parameters of the IAM are
   described below:

   Message type:                             IAM

   Nature of connection indicators
     Satellite Indicator:                    00 no satellite circuit
     Continuity check indicator:             It depends on the call
     Echo control device indicator:          It depends on the call

   Forward call indicators
     National/International call indicator:  It depends on the call
     End-to-end method indicator:            00 no end-to-end method
     Interworking indicator:                 0  no interworking
     End-to-end information indicator        0  no end-to-end info
     ISDN user part indicator:               1  ISDN all the way
     ISDN user part preference indicator:    00 ISDN preferred
     ISDN access indicator:                  1  ISDN access
     SCCP method indicator:                  0  no indication

   Calling party's category:                 00001010 ordinary

   Transmission medium requirement:          It depends on the call

   Called party's number:                    Based on the 'to' field

   The optional parameter 'Calling party number' can be added. Its
   value can be derived based on the SIP 'from' header.

   When the ISUP parameters regarding interworking are set, this
   indicates that ISDN is interworking with a network which is not
   capable of providing as many services as ISDN does. ISUP will
   therefore not employ certain features it otherwise normally uses.
   Thus, 'interworking encountered' must not be specified so that ISUP
   behaves normally. SIP is considered as an SS7 network and a SIP
   phone is considered as ISDN access since the SIP network is supposed
   to provide at least as many services as ISUP.

   After sending the IAM the timer T7 is started. The default value of
   T7 is between 20 and 30 seconds.

   The MGC goes to the 'Trying' state.

6.2 Timer T7 expires

   Since no response was received from the PSTN all the resources in
   the MG are released. A '408 request timeout' is sent back to the SIP
   network. An ACK arrives acknowledging the reception of the response.

6.3 CANCEL request is received

   If a CANCEL request is received, a '200 OK' is sent to the SIP
   network. All the resources are released and a REL message is sent to
   the PSTN with cause value 16 (normal clearing). A RLC from the PSTN
   is received indicating that the release sequence is complete.

   It is important that all the resources are released before the
   gateway sends any REL message.

   If instead of receiving a CANCEL, a BYE request arrives, after
   answering properly to the BYE (200 OK) all the resources in the MGC
   are released and a REL message is sent to the PSTN with cause value
   16 (normal clearing). A RLC from the PSTN is received indicating
   that the release sequence is complete.

   This section (6.3) applies every time that a CANCEL or a BYE is
   received before a final SIP response has been sent.

6.4 REL is received

   The REL contains a cause value. The SIP response is sent based on
   this cause value.

   ISUP Cause value                        SIP response

   Normal event

   1 unallocated number                    410 Gone

   31 normal unspecified                   404 Not found

   Resource unavailable

   This kind of cause value indicates a non permanent situation. A
   'Retry-After' header has to be added to the response.

   34 no circuit available                 503 Service unavailable
   38 network out of order                 503 Service unavailable

   44 requested channel not available      503 Service unavailable
   47 resource unavailable                 503 Service unavailable

   Service or option not available

   This kind of cause value indicates a permanent situation

   55 incoming calls bared within CUG      603 Decline
   57 bearer capability not authorized     501 Not implemented
   58 bearer capability not presently      501 Not implemented
      available

   Invalid message

   87 user not member of CUG               603 decline
   88 incompatible destination             400 Bad request
   95 invalid message                      400 Bad request

   Protocol error

   102 recovery of timer expiry            480 Request timeout
   111 protocol error                      400 Bad request

   Interworking

   127 interworking unspecified            500 Server internal error

   If a different cause value was received the default response '500
   Server internal error' would be used.

   This section applies every time that a REL is received before a
   final SIP response has been sent.


6.5 Early ACM is received

   This message is sent in certain situations for resetting the timers.
   In these cases this message indicates that the call is in progress
   but callee is not being alerted. This occurs for example in mobile
   networks, where roaming can take a long time. The early ACM is sent
   before the user is alerted to reset T7 and start T9.

   An ACM is considered an 'early ACM' if the Called Party's Status
   Indicator is set to 00 (no indication).

   After receiving an early ACM the progress of the call is indicated
   by the network sending CPGs.

   When there is interworking with some old systems, it is possible to
   receive an ANM immediately after an early ACM (without CPG). In this
   situation the SIP user will not hear any kind of ringback tone
   before the callee answers. In ISDN [6] this is solved by connecting
   the voice path backwards before sending the IAM.

6.6 ACM is received

   The nearest local exchange to the caller generates the ringback tone
   and may send voice announcements.

   A '183 session progress message' [7] is sent to the SIP network.
   Even if there are not in-band notifications or announcements it is
   not correct to send a '180 Ringing' response, since the ringback
   tone has to be generated by the PSTN exchange, and not by the SIP
   UAC/UAS.

6.7 CON is received

   A '200 OK' response is sent to the SIP network.

6.8 Timer T9 expires

   Since an ANM has not arrived in time the call is aborted. All the
   resources in the MG are released. A '408 request timeout' is sent to
   the SIP network. A REL message with cause value 102 (recovery of
   timer expiry) is sent to the PSTN. The PSTN responds with RLC and
   the SIP network responds with an ACK indicating that the release
   sequence has been completed.

6.9 CPG with status 'alerting' is received

   If a CPG message with Event Indicator 'Alerting' or 'in-band
   information or an appropriate pattern is now available' is received
   the same procedure as described in section 6.5 is followed.

6.10 Timer T9 expires

   This indicates that the ANM has not arrived in time specified. This
   results in the call being aborted. All the resources related to the
   media path are released. A '480 temporarily unavailable' is sent to
   the SIP network. A REL message with cause value 102 (recovery of
   timer expiry) is sent to the ISUP part. The PSTN responds with RLC
   and the SIP network responds with an ACK indicating that the release
   sequence has been completed.

6.11 CPG is received

   A CPG can indicate progress, alerting or in-band information. Since
   there is already a one-way voice path open, there is no need of
   taking further action.

6.12 ANM is received

   The callee has picked up the phone. A '200 OK' response is sent to
   the SIP network.

6.13 ACK is received

   At this stage a two-way voice channel is established between the
   caller and the callee. The call is connected and the conversation
   can take place.

7.1 Address received

   Upon the reception of an IAM resources are reserved in the MG and it
   gets backward through connected.

   The B-party number can be received in just one IAM ('en bloc'
   signalling) or in one IAM followed by one or several SAMs (overlap
   signalling). In some countries there is no way for the MGC to know
   whether the B-party number is already complete or some SAMs will
   still arrive.

   If the MGC relies on the inter-digit timeout to assume that the
   number is complete the establishment of the connection is delayed.
   Alternatively, if the MGC sends the INVITE request immediately after
   receiving the IAM heavy signalling traffic may be generated.

   Therefore every individual MGC must be configured with a specific
   timer. If an MGC never receives a SAM the value of the timer should
   be zero. If the reception of a SAM is likely the value of the timer
   should be sufficient for receiving them before the INVITE is sent
   (after receiving the minimum amount of digits that can represent a
   number, around 5 seconds).

   Thus, after receiving the B-party number, the MGC issues an INVITE
   request. If after sending this request a SAM is received the MGC
   will CANCEL the INVITE and send a new INVITE to the complete
   address. If a '484 Address Incomplete' is received the MGC should
   wait for subsequent SAMs and send a new INVITE.

7.2 1xx received

   Response received                        Message sent by the MGC

   100 Trying                               Nothing
   180 Ringing                              ACM

   182 Queued                               ACM
   183 Session progress message             ACM

   After the MGC receives of a '180 Ringing' response the MG generates
   the ringback tone.

   After the MGC receives a '183 Session progress message' response
   the SIP network generates the ringback tone (or any announcement).

   The ACM sent by the MGC after the reception of a '180' response or a
   '183' response is the same. The mandatory parameters of the ACM are
   described below:

   Message type:                            ACM

   Backward Indicators
     Charge indicator:                      10 charge
     Called party's status indicator:       01 subscriber free
     Called party's category indicator:     01 ordinary subscriber
     End-to-end method indicator:           00 no end-to-end method
     Interworking indicator:                0  no interworking

     ISDN access indicator:                 1  ISDN access
     Echo control device indicator:         It depends on the call
     SCCP method indicator:                 00 no indication

7.3 200 received

   Response received                        Message sent by the MGC

   200 OK                                   ANM, ACK

   After receiving a 200 OK response the MGC establishes a two-way
   voice path in the MG and it sends an ANM to the PSTN and an ACK to
   the SIP network.

   If the '200 OK' response arrives before the MGC has sent the ACM, a
   CON is sent instead of the ANM.

7.3 3xx received

   3xx responses                            Message sent by the MGC

   300 Multiple choices                     Early ACM
   301 Moved permanently                    Early ACM
   302 Moved temporarily                    Early ACM
   305 Use proxy                            Early ACM
   380 Alternative services                 Early ACM or REL
                                            with cause 58
                                            (if the service proposed is
                                            not supported by the PSTN)

   When any of these responses is received the MGC should try to
   contact the user using the 'Contact' headers present in the
   response. These 3xx responses are typically sent by a re-direct
   server. This is a similar device to the HLR in mobile networks. It
   provides another address where the callee may be reached.

   If a SIP provisional response is received after sending the Early
   ACM, a CPG is sent (instead of an ACM).

7.4 4xx received

   The MGC releases the resources in the MG, send a REL to the PSTN
   with a cause value and send an ACK to the SIP network. An RLC
   arrives indicating that the release sequence is complete.

8. Release of the connection

   In analog PSTN, if the callee hangs up in the middle of a call the
   local exchange sends a SUS instead of a REL and starts a timer (T6,
   SUS is network initiated). When the timer expires, the REL is sent.

   In ISDN networks, the user can generate a SUS (timer T2, user
   initiated) in order to unplug the terminal from the socket and plug
   it in another one. A RES is sent once the terminal has been
   reconnected and the T2 timer has not expired.

   When SUS and RES messages arrive from the PSTN the gateway will not
   modify the status of the resources involved in the control of the
   media stream. This way the signalling traffic in the network is
   reduced (no messages are exchanged between MGC and MG). For the SIP
   UAC/UAS the result is an interruption in the voice path until the
   other party picks up the phone again.

   For a normal release of the call (reception of REL from the PSTN or
   BYE from the SIP network), the MGC first releases the resources in
   the MG and then answers the message received (RLC to the PSTN or
   '200 OK' to the SIP network). The connection on the other side is
   then released by sending a REL for the PSTN or a BYE to the SIP
   network. The REL sent by the MGC has a cause value of 16 (normal
   call clearing).

9. Other ISUP flavours

   Other flavours of ISUP different than Q.767 [2] have more parameters
   and more features. Some of the parameters have more possible values
   and provide more information about the status of the call.

   However, differences in the message flows are more important. In
   ANSI ISUP, there is no CON message. An ANM is sent instead (with no
   ACM). In call forwarding situations, CPGs can be sent before the ACM
   is sent. No SAMs are sent. 'En bloc' signalling is always used.
