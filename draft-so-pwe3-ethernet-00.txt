Abstract 
 
   This document describes the Psuedo Wire (PW) [Pate][Xiao] service 
   specific implementation for Ethernet. An Ethernet PW allows 
   Ethernet Protocol Data Units (PDUs) to be carried over Packet 
   Switched Networks (PSNs) using IP, L2TP or MPLS transport. This 
   will enable Service Providers to leverage their existing PSN to 
   offer Ethernet services.

1. Introduction 
    
   There is growing interest in using high speed and high performance 
   IP and MPLS-enabled IP networks to transport legacy L2 
   technologies, such as Ethernet, Frame Relay and ATM as described in 
   [Martini-encap], [Martini-trans], [Kompella] and [Rosen].  
    
   This draft defines encapsulation mechanisms to transport Ethernet 
   traffic over the Packet Switched Networks (PSNs) using MPLS[MPLS], 
   L2TP [L2TPv3] and GRE [GRE-encap][GRE-IPv4] tunnels 
   This document defines the PDU processing, maintenance and 
   encapsulation behaviors when emulating Ethernet services based on 
   the PWE3 architecture[Pate]over a PSN. The scope of the document 
   includes: 
    
     - Pseudo-wire (PW) requirements for emulating the Ethernet 
        trunking and switching behavior.  
     - Setup of the Ethernet PW between PE devices over the PSN 
        tunnel 
     - Ingress and egress packet processing of Ethernet PDUs 
     - Encapsulation of Ethernet PDUs over MPLS, IP/GRE and L2TP 
        tunneling mechanisms 
     - Transport and delivery of encapsulated packets over    
        Ethernet PW 
     - Maintenance function and interactions with the PSN tunnel   
        for the Ethernet PW 
     - QoS and security considerations 
     - Inter-domain transport considerations for Ethernet PW  
    
   It is not within the scope of the document to specify how and when 
   the PSN tunnel be set up. However, information needed to establish 
   PWs over PSN  is specified, as well as suggestions on how such PWs 
   are maintained. 
    
   The following two figures describe the reference models which are 
   derived from [Pate][Xiao] to support the Ethernet PW emulated 
   services.

3. Requirements For Ethernet Pseudo-Wire Emulation  
    
3.1. Point-to-Point Mode 
    
   A point-to-point Ethernet PW emulates a single Ethernet link 
   between exactly two endpoints. The following reference model 
   describes the termination point of each end of the PW within the 
   PE:

   The PW terminates at a logical port within the PE, defined at point 
   A in the above diagram. This port provides an Ethernet MAC service 
   that will deliver each Ethernet packet that is received at point A, 
   unaltered, to the point A in the corresponding PE at the other end 
   of the PW.

   The "Adaptation" function includes packet processing needed to 
   translate the Ethernet packets that arrive at the CE-PE interface 
   to/from the Ethernet packets that are applied to the PW termination 
   point. Such functions may include VLAN-tag stripping, overwriting 
   or adding, physical port multiplexing/demultiplexing, PW-PW 
   bridging, L2 encapsulation, shaping, policing, etc.  
    
   The points to the left of A, including the physical layer between 
   the CE and PE, and any adaptation functions between it and the PW 
   terminations, are outside of the scope of PWE3 and are not defined 
   here.  
    
   "PW Termination", between A and B, represents the operations for 
   setting up and maintaining the PW, and for encapsulating and 
   decapsulating the Ethernet packets according to the PSN type in 
   use. This document defines these operations, and the services 
   offered and required at points A and B. 
    
   "PSN Tunnel" denotes the PSN tunneling technology that is being 
   used: either IP/GRE, MPLS or L2TP. 
    
   A point-to-point pseudo wire can be one of the two types: raw and 
   tagged. This is a property of virtual Ethernet link and indicates 
   whether the pseudo wire MUST contain an 802.1Q VLAN field (i.e. 
   tagged mode or may/may not contain a tag (i.e. raw mode).  
    
   The rest of this chapter describes the service at A and the PW 
   Termination behavior that are common to all PSN types. Subsequent 
   chapters describe the specific mechanisms unique to each PSN type. 
    
3.2. Multi-point Mode 
    
   A multi-point Ethernet PW would emulate a whole Ethernet segment. 
   This segment could be broadcast (like a piece of coax) or switched 
   (like an 802.1D bridge [802.1D]). The reference diagram of section 
   3.1 would still apply, with the following additions:  
    
     - There would be more PSN destinations to the right, to     
        represent the additional endpoints of the PW.  
         
     - The PW termination function would have to include    
        mechanisms for selecting the correct egress PE(s)     (and 
        hence PSN tunnel(s)) for each Ethernet packet presented to the 
        PW. This could involve replication and/or MAC address 
        learning.  
   
   As there are alternative mechanisms for providing virtual Ethernet 
   segments using multiple point-to-point Ethernet PWs and a suitable 
   Adaptation function (e.g. see [Vkompella]), the multipoint Ethernet 
   PW is not addressed further in this document.

3.3.1. Encapsulation  
    
   The entire Ethernet frame without the preamble or FCS is 
   transported as a single packet. PSN-specific tunnel identifiers are 
   prepended to this. 
      
   In the multi-point case where the egress PE needs to know which 
   ingress PE forwarded the packet this information must be derived 
   from the PW-specific tunnel identifiers. In the MPLS case this 
   implies that a separate VC label be assigned to each ingress PE.  
   With such consideration, the following implications shall be 
   examined, i.e. 
    
     - It implies the use of the global VC label pool per node, and 
         
     - It may limit the selection of the VC label distribution 
        approach. 
    
   In the IP case this information can be derived from the source IP 
   address of the packet. In the L2TP case this can be derived from 
   the Session ID in the received packet. 
    
3.3.2. MTU Management  
    
   Ingress and egress PWESes MUST agree on their maximum MTU size to 
   be transported over the PSN. The consideration of the MTU size 
   management can be referred to Appendix-A. Each PSN-specific PWE 
   approach will determine if the Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR) 
   will be supported, and if so, what the mechanism should be.  
    
3.3.3. Frame Ordering  
    
   In general, applications running over Ethernet do not require 
   strict frame ordering. However the IEEE definition of 802.3 [802.3] 
   requires that frames from the same conversation are delivered in 
   sequence. Moreover, the PSN cannot (in the general case) be assumed 
   to provide or to guarantee frame ordering. Therefore if frame 
   ordering is required, a sequence number MUST be implemented and 
   utilized. 
    
   The sequence number mechanism is PSN-specificand will be described 
   in the PSN-specific section, if supported.  
      
3.3.4. Frame Error Processing  
    
   An encapsulated Ethernet frame traversing a psuedo-wire can be 
   dropped, corrupted or delivered out-of-order. Per [Xiao], packet-
   loss, corruption, and out-of-order delivery is considered to be a 
   "generalized bit error" of the psuedo-wire. Therefore, the native 
   Ethernet frame error processing mechanisms MUST be extended to the 
   corresponding psuedo-wire service. Meaning, if an ingress device 
   receives a standard Ethernet frame containing hardware level CRC

   errors, framing errors, or a runt condition, the frame MUST be 
   discarded on input.  
    
3.3.5. IEEE 802.3x Flow Control Interworking 
    
   In a standard Ethernet network, the flow control mechanism is 
   optional and typically configured between the two nodes on a point-
   to-point link (e.g. between the CE and the PE). IEEE 802.3x PAUSE 
   frames MUST NOT be carried across the PW. See Appendix A for notes 
   on CE-PE flow control. 
      
3.3.6. IEEE 802.1Q User Priority Interworking 
    
   The ingress router MAY consider the user priority field [802.1Q] of 
   the VLAN tag header when determining the value to be placed in the 
   Quality of Service field of the encapsulating protocol (e.g., the 
   EXP fields of the MPLS label stack). In a similar way, the egress 
   router MAY consider the Quality of Service field of the 
   encapsulating protocol when queuing the packet for egress. 
    
3.4. Maintenance  
    
   This section describes the PW link maintenance requirements in a 
   point-to-point configuration.  
    
   For the requirements described below, if possible, it is desirable 
   to have a common mechanism (e.g. signaling protocol) to meet those 
   requirement objectives across various PSN types (i.e. MPLS, IP/IP, 
   GRE, L2TP etc.) regardless of the type of maintenance functions 
   such as link establishment or auto-discovery etc. One example is to 
   use MP-BGP [MP-BGP] to auto-discover various PWESs at each PE and 
   to distribute the PSN tunnel label; and to use LDP to distribute 
   the PW's label across each PSN.  
    
3.4.1. Pseudo-wire Establishment 
    
   An Ethernet PW can be established over a PSN either via 
   configuration or via some sort of signaling mechanism, e.g. LDP, 
   MP-BGP etc., whichever is applicable to the underlying PSN.  
    
   If available, an auto-discovery mechanism, which may be associated 
   with some signaling mechanism (e.g. LDP, MP-BGP) or some server 
   based solution (e.g. DNS), can be used to identify the Ethernet PW 
   types (e.g. native Ethernet or VLAN type) among the PE peers across 
   the PSN. It is expected that when a PW is established between the 
   PEs, the Ethernet PW types are compatible at each end of the PW, 
   i.e. tagged to tagged or raw to raw. 
    
   Multiple PWs can be set up within the same PSN tunnel and 
   therefore, the PE/PWES is required to have an ability to support a 
   mechanism to multiplex and de-multiplex the various PW instances.  
   The VC label for an Ethernet PW instance shall be unique at least

   within the same PSN tunnel so that misrouting of the Ethernet 
   packet can be prevented.  
    
   In the case when 802.1p [802.1p] support is required, a COS mapping 
   mechanism (e.g. MPLS EXP field and IP Diffserv DSCP mapping) shall 
   be configured at each PE. The policy of the service mapping between 
   the PW and the PSN tunnel is outside the scope of this 
   specification.  
    
3.4.2. Link State Monitoring  
    
   It is desirable to detect Ethernet PW failure at the PE which is 
   caused either by the PW itself or by the PSN in a timely manner. 
   The performance monitoring objective is a network policy and is not 
   within the scope of this specification.  
    
   Since Ethernet provides a bi-directional link, Ethernet PWs are bi-
   directional PWs. Note that the Ethernet PW may be carried over 
   unidirectional PSN tunnels.  
    
   The PW is considered to be active if all the following are true: 
    
   1. The local PWES is active. 
   2. The remote PWES is active. 
   3. The PSN tunnel used to transport the PW to the remote PE is   
       up. 
   4. The PSN tunnel used to transport the PW from the remote PE     
       is up. 
    
   In order to enable the remote PE to know the status of the local 
   PWES, a PE which is using a maintenance mechanism to establish PWs 
   MUST use its maintenance channel to the remote PE to gracefully 
   withdraw the PW label prior to the local PWES goes down. In the 
   case of manually configured PWs there is no such maintenance 
   channel and thus the remote PE will be unaware of the local PWES 
   status - and must assume it to be active. 
    
   The status of the PSN tunnels to and from the remote PE is not 
   always known. PSN-specific considerations are detailed in the 
   relevant sections below. 
    
   In the case when there is a high volume of Ethernet PWs across the 
   PSN, a bundling approach can be used to enhance the scalability of 
   the PW link state monitoring and error reporting.  
    
   Another aspect of the link state monitoring is to detect mis-
   routing, i.e. routing traffic from one PW to another PW, due to the 
   corruption of forwarding table. This is especially essential when 
   the PSN tunneling mechanism is connectionless based. Mechanism like 
   Trace Route would be very useful for detecting failure condition.  
    
3.4.3. Fault Detection & Recovery 
    
 
So et al                  Expires April 2002                 [Page 11] 

Internet Draft      draft-so-pwe3-ethernet-00.txt         October 2001 
 
   Unlike some other transmission technologies, e.g. SONET/SDH, 
   Ethernet does not have a specific standard performance requirement 
   for fault detection and recovery. The requirement on an Ethernet PW 
   is that its reliability performance is identical to standard 
   Ethernet, the performance indicators for this is for further study. 
    
   It is important to be able to detect failures that have an impact 
   on the Ethernet PW. There are three types of failures that needs to 
   be detected: 
    
     1. PSN tunnel failures 
     2. VC tunnel failures  
     3. PWES failures 
         
   The detection and diagnostics of these failures requires a co-
   ordination between the PSN tunnel, the VC-tunnel and the PWES. 
    
   When triggering recovery mechanisms for tunnels that carries an 
   Ethernet PW, one must consider the bi-directional nature of the 
   Ethernet PW, and therefore, even if the PSN tunnel is uni-
   directional, it shall be transparent to the Ethernet PW.  
    
   It is possible that network may provide primary and secondary PSN 
   tunnels to ensure fast recovery. In such case, the expected 
   behavior shall be described of how to perform the failover for the 
   Ethernet PW.  
    
3.5. Management 
    
   The PW management model of Ethernet PW follows the general 
   management guidelines for PW management as appear in [PW-MIB] and 
   defined in [Xiao][Pate]. It is composed of 3 components. [PW-MIB] 
   defines the parameters common to all types of PW and PSNs, for 
   example common counters, error handling, some maintenance protocol 
   parameters etc. For each type of PSN there is a separate module 
   that defines the association of the PW to the PSN tunnel, see 
   example in [PW-MPLS-MIB] for the MPLS PSN. For Ethernet PW, 
   additional MIB module defines the Ethernet specific parameters 
   required to be configured or monitored. A MIB module for Ethernet 
   service will be available soon. 
    
   The above modules enable both manual configuration and the use of 
   maintenance algorithm to set up the Ethernet PW and monitor PW 
   state where applicable. 
    
   As specified in [Xiao][Pate], an implementation SHOULD support the 
   relevant PW MIB modules for PW set-up and monitoring. Other 
   mechanisms for PW set up (command line interface for example) MAY 
   be supported. 
    
3.6. Security

Internet Draft      draft-so-pwe3-ethernet-00.txt         October 2001 
 
   This document specifies the security consideration regarding the 
   encapsulations and maintenance (signaling) for setting up the PW. 
   In terms of encapsulation, security of the encapsulated packets 
   depends on the nature of the protocol that is carried by these 
   packets, while the encapsulation itself shall not affect the 
   related security issues. The signaling extensions as the result of 
   the PW support shall not change nor introduce any security issue 
   related to the existing protocols. 
    
   Nevertheless, the security limitations of the PE and/or the PW MUST 
   not restrict the security implementation choices of the user of the 
   PWE3 (i.e. users should be able to implement IPSEC or any other 
   appropriate security mechanism in addition to the security inherent 
   in the PW)". 
    
   It is required that PEs will have user separation between different 
   PW and different virtual ports that the PWs are connected to. For 
   example: if two PWs are connected to the same physical port and 
   associated to different virtual ports (i.e. VLANs), it is required 
   that packets from one VC will not be forwarded to the VLAN that is 
   associated to the second VCs. 
    
   A received packet is associated with a PW by means of the VC label. 
   However this mechanism provides no guarantee that the packet was 
   sent by the peer PE. Further checks may be useful to protect 
   against mis-configuration and connection hijacking.  
    
   The PE must be able to be protected from malformed, or maliciously 
   altered, customer traffic. This includes, but is not limited to, 
   illegal VLAN use, short packets, long packets, etc. 
    
   Security achieved by access control of MAC addresses is out of 
   scope of this document. 
    
   Additional security requirements related to the use of PW in a 
   switching (virtual bridging)is not discussed here. 
    
3.7. QoS Consideration  
    
   A PE MUST support the ability to carry the Ethernet PW as a best 
   effort service over the PSN. Transparency of PRI bits (if exist 
   originally) between edges MUST be preserved, regardless of the COS 
   support at the PSN. In case of adding VLAN field at the edges, a 
   default PRI setting of zero MUST be supported, configured default 
   value is recommended. 
    
   A PE may support additional QOS support by means of one or more of 
   the following method: 
    
     1. One COS per PW end service (PWES), mapped to a single COS PW 
        at the PSN. 
         

 
So et al                  Expires April 2002                 [Page 13] 

Internet Draft      draft-so-pwe3-ethernet-00.txt         October 2001 
 
     2. Multiple COS per PWES mapped to a single PW with multiple COS 
        at the PSN. 
         
     3. Multiple COS per PWES mapped to multiple PWs at the PSN. 
    
   Examples of the cases above and details of the service mapping 
   consideration are described in Appendix-B. 
    
   The PW guaranteed rate at the PSN level is PW provider policy based 
   on agreement with the customer, and may be different from the 
   Ethernet physical port rate. Consideration of Ethernet flow control 
   was discussed in 3.3.5.  The mechanism to coordinate the 
   transmission rate between the two PWESs will be discussed in more 
   details in the PSN specific session, if supported.  
    
3.8. Inter-domain PW Support Consideration  
    
   In the inter-domain case the requirements above all continue to 
   apply. 
    
3.8.1. PSN tunnel establishment 
    
   In the GRE and L2TP cases the PSN tunnel is implicitly formed from 
   a (source, destination) IP address pair (as mentioned above.)  For 
   inter-domain operation both these IP addresses SHOULD be globally-
   unique (i.e. NIC assigned) addresses. 
    
   In the MPLS case the PSN tunnel is explicitly signaled, using a 
   label distribution protocol. In order to support inter-domain 
   operation the FEC for the PE SHOULD correspond to a globally-unique 
   address. Furthermore a label distribution protocol suitable for 
   inter-domain operation (e.g MP-BGP) should be used at edge of each 
   autonomous system in the path. 
    
3.8.2. PW establishment 
    
   If a signaling mechanism is used to establish the PW then the 
   protocol chosen MUST be suitable for inter-domain operation. 
   Furthermore, the identifier used for the PW SHOULD be globally 
   unique. 
    
3.8.3. Security Considerations 
    
   In the case of a PW crossing from one autonomous system to another, 
   through a private interconnection, security considerations are much 
   the same as in the intra-domain case. However in some cases the PW 
   may travel through a third-party autonomous system, or across a 
   public interconnection point. In these cases there may be a 
   requirement to encrypt the user data using a method appropriate to 
   the PSN tunneling mechanism. 
    
4. Ethernet PW Over MPLS

   Ethernet PW packets are encapsulated over an MPLS network using the 
   mechanisms defined in [Martini-encap]. 
    
    
4.1. Packet Processing 
    
4.1.1. Encapsulation 
    
   Ethernet PW packets are encapsulated in the "Ethernet VLAN" mode of 
   [Martini-encap] for tagged PWs, and in the "Ethernet" mode of 
   [Martini-encap] for raw PWs. 
     
4.1.2. Frame Ordering 
    
   If frame ordering must be preserved then the control word defined 
   in [Martini-encap] is used. Since the minimum length of an Ethernet 
   frame is 60 octets, and since the control word length field 
   includes the length fo the control word itself (4 octets), the 
   length field of the control word will always be set to zero (as 
   will the reserved and flag bits.) 
    
   The default case for Ethernet PW is to operate without a control 
   word. 
    
4.2. Maintenance 
    
   The procedures defined in [Martini-trans] MUST be used for 
   maintenance of Ethernet PWs carried over MPLS. 
    
4.2.1. Link State Monitoring 
    
   The PSN tunnel to the remote PE is considered to be up if there is 
   a valid label to reach the remote PE. 
    
   If LDP is being used to distribute the PSN tunnel label then there 
   is no way to know if the PSN tunnel from the remote PE is up. 
   However is RSVP-TE or CR-LDP is used to distribute the PSN tunnel 
   label then the status of this tunnel is known. 
    
4.3. Management  
    
   The management procedures are as defined above. Note that [PW-MPLS-
   MIB] defines the mapping from the PW to the MPLS tunnel. 
    
4.4. Security 
    
   This draft does not affect the underlying security issues of MPLS 
   (as specified in [MPLS]). Additional security measures MAY be used 
   if the lookup process of the PW will include both PSN label and VC 
   label in case of global VC labels. See [PW-MPLS-MIB] for more 
   details.

   Ethernet PW packets are encapsulated over an IP network using the 
   Generic Routing Encapsulation protocol as specified in [GRE-encap, 
   GRE-IPv4]. 
    
   Note: an alternative method of encapsulating Ethernet PW packets 
   over IP is to use the MPLS encapsulation (see chapter 4) and an 
   MPLS-in-IP protocol  as described in [Rekhter][Worster]. 
    
5.1. Packet Processing  
    
5.1.1. Encapsulation 
    
   An Ethernet packet is encapsulated into a single IP packet as shown 
   below:

   The Protocol Type field is set to a number to be allocated by IEEE 
   for this purpose.  
   The Key field contains the PW label that is assigned by the 
   destination PE. The field is right-aligned and padded with zeros if 
   necessary. The PW label is used as a demultiplexing field to allow 
   multiple PWs between pairs of PEs. The egress PE should assign a PW 
   label that will allow it to determine which PW an arriving packet 
   belongs to. 
    
   The Sequence Number field (if present) is used as described in 
   RFC2890 to maintain or guarantee packet ordering within a 
   particular PW. 
    
5.1.2. Frame Ordering 
    
   The normative statements in RFC2890 apply as written to the sending 
   and receiving PEs. In particular a receiving PE MUST correctly 
   parse a GRE packet containing a sequence number, 
   even if it is unable to provide sequencing. 
    
5.1.3. MTU Management 
    
   Techniques such as Path MTU Discovery [MTU] may be used to 
   determine the MTU of the IP/GRE Tunnel. Alternatively the MTU may 
   be statically configured, or configured per destination PE. 
    
   The sending PE MUST NOT fragment an IPv4 packet containing an 
   Ethernet PW PDU, and MUST set the DF bit in the IPv4 header. 
    
5.2. Maintenance 
    
   Any Ethernet PW maintenance protocol that allows the distribution 
   of PW labels may be used. Other generic attributes that may be 
   validated include MTU, sequencing preference, trunking mode, etc.

   IP protocols such as ICMP ping may be used to verify PW 
   connectivity for all the PWs between a pair of PEs. 
    
5.2.1. Link State Monitoring 
    
   The PSN tunnel to the remote PE is considered to be up if there is 
   a valid route to reach the remote PE. There is, however, no way to 
   determine if the PSN tunnel from the remote PE is up. 
    
5.3. Management  
    
   Generic management procedures apply. 
    
5.4. Security  
    
5.4.1. Forwarding Plane  
    
   The nature of the IP/GRE encapsulation means that it would be 
   relatively easy for an external intruder to spoof packets that 
   appeared to belong to a particular PW. The receiving PE SHOULD 
   verify that the source PE IP address corresponds to the expected 
   source IP address for the PW, and filtering of source-spoofed 
   packets from outside a trusted domain may be necessary. 
    
   Another issue is the ability of IP/GRE PW packets to escape from a 
   trusted domain due to transient routing changes/errors or an attack 
   on the routing protocols themselves. To protect this it may be 
   necessary to install filters to prevent IP/GRE Ethernet 
   PW packets from leaving the domain. 
    
   Additionally or alternatively, IP security procedures such as IPSec 
   may be used to further enhance the security of all PWs between a 
   pair of PEs. This most likely be a requirement 
   for inter-domain PWs. 
    
5.4.2. Control Plane 
    
   In the control plane, generic maintenance security procedures 
   apply.  
    
5.5. QoS Consideration  
    
   The IP Diffserv model is used to provide differential class of 
   service to different PWs, or to different packets within the PW. 
   The mapping of Ethernet CoS markings to/from Diffserv codepoints is 
   a local configuration matter, but must follow the requirements in 
   section 3.7. 
    
6. Ethernet PW Over L2TP  
    
   This section describes how to provide Ethernet PWE over L2TPv3.

   [L2TP] was originally designed for tunneling PPP sessions. [L2TPv3] 
   separates out mechanisms designed specifically for PPP and provides 
   new extensions for tunneling generic layer-2 protocols such as 
   Ethernet, ATM and Frame Relay. 
    
   To provide Ethernet PWE between two PEs, an L2TPv3 control 
   connection can be established first. Individual L2TPv3 sessions can 
   then be established via signaling. Alternatively, L2TPv3 sessions 
   can be manually configured without requiring a control connection. 
   Each session can be used as a PW to connect two Ethernet ports or 
   VLANs.  
    
6.1. Packet Processing  
    
6.1.1. Encapsulation  
    
   The entire Ethernet frame without the preamble or FCS is 
   encapsulated in L2TPv3 and is sent as a single packet. This is done 
   regardless of whether an 802.1Q tag is present in the Ethernet 
   frame or not.  
    
                    +-------------------------------+ 
                    |       L2TPv3 Header           | 
                    +-------------------------------+ 
                    |       Ethernet frame          | 
                    +-------------------------------+ 
                                      
                      Figure 7: Ethernet over L2TPv3 
    
   An L2TPv3 data packet can be sent as over UDP or directly over IP. 
   The selection of UDP vs. IP is beyond scope of this document. 
    
   L2TPv3 data channels do not provide reliable or in-order delivery. 
   There is no sequence number field in an L2TPv3 header. If in-order 
   delivery for Ethernet frames is desired, an optional 4-octet 
   control word can be inserted between the L2TPv3 header and the 
   encapsulated Ethernet frame. The format of the control word is 
   identical to the control word defined in [Martini-encap]. The usage 
   of the control word fields is identical to what is defined in 
   [Martini-encap], except that the length field MUST be set to zero 
   at the ingress PE and be ignored at the egress PE. The 
   presence/non-presence of the control word for a particular PW 
   session is signaled during setup of the PW. The signaling process 
   is described in Section 6.2. 
    
   After the encapsulation, the whole packet is as follows: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3

   Figure 8: Encapsulation of Ethernet frames over L2TPv3  
    
   A session ID uniquely identifies a PW. It is used to multiplex and 
   de-multiplex PWs between two PEs. Session IDs only have local 
   significance. That is, the same PW will be given different Session 
   IDs by each PE. The Session ID specified in each message is that of 
   the intended recipient, not the sender [L2TPv3].  
    
   A cookie field is used to check the association of a received data 
   packet with the PW identified by the Session ID. The cookie guards 
   against the misrouting of data packets, which could result if the 
   incorrect Session ID is specified in received packets (due to mis-
   configuration, header corruption, or otherwise) [L2TPv3]. 
    
6.1.2. Frame Ordering 
    
   In cases where in-order delivery of Ethernet frames is critical, 
   the control word can be used. The sequence number field in the 
   control word can be used to detect out-of-order delivery. The 
   generation and processing of the sequence number at the ingress and 
   egress PEs, respectively, are identical to what are defined in 
   [Martini-encap]. The presence of a control word is signaled during 
   setup of the L2TPv3 session for this PW. The signaling process is 
   described in Section 6.2. 
    
6.1.3. MTU Handling  
    
   With L2TPv3 as the tunneling protocol, the packet resulted from the 
   encapsulation is N bytes longer than Ethernet frame without the 
   preamble or FCS, where 
    
   N=8, without a control word and L2TPv3 data messages are over IP;  
   N=12, with a control word and L2TPv3 data messages are over IP;  
   N=16, without a control word and L2TPv3 data messages are over UDP; 
   N=20, with a control word and L2TPv3 data messages are over UDP;  
   (N does not include the IP header). 
    
   In order to avoid fragmentation, ideally the PSN should be 
   configured with an MTU that is larger than or equal to the largest 
   Ethernet frame size (without the preamble or FCS) plus 20 bytes. If 
   the PSN cannot support such a MTU, another option is to set the MTU 
   size of the two Ethernet ports between the PEs and the CEs to 
   (network_MTU - 20). This may imply that Ethernet jumbo frame cannot 
   be used.

   If the PSN cannot be configured with a sufficiently large MTU to 
   avoid fragmentation, Ethernet PWE over L2TPv3 can rely on IP 
   fragmentation. 
    
6.2. Maintenance 
    
6.2.1. Pseudo-wire Establishment 
    
   With L2TPv3 as the tunneling protocol, Ethernet PWs are L2TPv3 
   sessions. There are two ways to set up L2TPv3 sessions: 
    
   (1)  Manual configuration; 
   (2)  Establishing an L2TPv3 control connection first and then 
        establishing of individual sessions via signaling. The 
        procedure is defined in [L2TPv3]. In order for an L2TPv3 
        control connection to support Ethernet PWs, it must be 
        signaled to support Ethernet VLAN and Ethernet ports. This is 
        done using the "Pseudo-wire capability list" Attribute-Value 
        Pair (AVP). 
    
6.2.1.1. Control Connection Establishment 
    
   If a control connection is to be established, the possible types of 
   PW sessions associated with this control connection MUST be 
   negotiated first. This is done using the Pseudo Wire Capabilities 
   List AVP that indicates the L2 payload types that will be accepted 
   by the PE that originates this control message. The Attribute Value 
   field for this AVP has the following format: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Capabilities List are as follows (pending IANA approval): 
    
   Legal "Pseudo Wire Types" that may be included in the Pseudo Wire 
   Capabilities List are defined below (pending IANA approval):

               are allowed  
      0x8005 - Sessions with control word for connecting Ethernet ports 
               are allowed

   Note that the most significant bit of the "Pseudo-Wire Type" field 
   is used to indicate the presence/non-presence of a control word in a
   PW session. If the bit is set, a control word is present. Otherwise,
   it is not.  
    
6.2.1.2. PW session establishment 
    
   Pieces of information needed for each PW session are described 
   below. Such information is either manually configured at the 
   ingress and egress PEs, or dynamically signaled with L2TPv3 AVPs. 
    
   - Pseudo Wire Type 
    
   The type of a PW can be either "Ethernet port" or "Ethernet VLAN".  
    
   If signaling is used, the "Pseudo Wire Type" AVP, Attribute Type 
   TBA, indicates the payload type for a PW. 
    
   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format: 
    
       0                   1 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |       Pseudo Wire Type        | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   "Pseudo wire type" values are defined in Section 6.2.1.1. 
    
   A PE MUST NOT request to set up a PW with a "Pseudo wire type" AVP 
   specifying a value not advertised in the "Pseudo Wire Capabilities 
   List" AVP it received during control connection establishment. 
   Attempts to do so will result in the failure of PW setup. 
    
   - Presence/non-presence of control word 
    
   If the presence/non-presence of control word for a PW session is to 
   be signaled, then: 
    
     - If the two Pseudo-Wire End Services (PWES's) are Ethernet 
        VLANs, the presence/non-presence of control word can be 
        signaled by using the value 0x0004 or 0x8004, respectively.  
          
     - If the two PWES's are Ethernet ports, the presence/non-
        presence of control word can be signaled by using the value 
        0x0005 or 0x8005, respectively.  
    
   That is, the most significant bit, i.e. the C bit, of the "Pseudo-
   Wire Type" field is used to indicate the presence/non-presence of 
   the control word in a PW. If the bit is set, the control word is 
   present. Otherwise, it is not.

   - PW ID 
    
   Each PW is associated with a PW ID. The two PEs of a PW have the 
   same PW ID for it. Together with the Pseudo-Wire Type, a PW ID 
   uniquely identifies a PW session at every PE. A new L2TPv3 AVP will 
   be defined for signaling the PW ID. 
    
   - Group ID 
    
   A Group ID is used for referring to a group of PWs so that they can 
   be signaled down collectively. The L2TPv3 "Private Group ID" AVP 
   can be used for signaling the Group ID. 
    
   - PWES parameters 
    
   Three parameters are defined for each Ethernet PWES. They can be 
   used for detecting mismatch between the two PWES's of a PW. 
    
        + Description string 
         
        This is an informational description string for a PWES. For 
        example, if the local PWES is VLAN 100 of interface GE 1/1 on 
        PE1, then the description string of the PW can be "PE1-GE1/1-
        VLAN100") 
         
        A new L2TPv3 AVP will be defined for signaling this 
        description string. 
         
        + MTU  
         
        This parameter specifies the MTU size of the local PWES. It 
        can be used for detecting MTU mismatch of the two PWES's of a 
        PW. MTU mismatch SHOULD be logged if identified. 
         
        A new L2TPv3 AVP will be defined for signaling the MTU of a 
        PWES.  
         
        + Speed 
         
        This parameter specifies the Send and Receive speed of the 
        PWES. That is, speed of an Ethernet PW is assumed to be 
        symmetric. The speed of a PWES should not be higher than the 
        speed of the physical port. The speed specification is mainly 
        for informational purpose, e.g., for detecting speed mismatch 
        of the two PWES's. An example of speed mismatch is: one PWES, 
        a VLAN, is specified to have speed 20Mbps (possibly via rate-
        limiting) and the other PWES, another VLAN, is specified to 
        have speed 40Mbps. Speed mismatch SHOULD be logged if 
        identified. 
         
        The L2TPv3 "Connect Speed" AVP can be used for signaling the 
        speed of a PWES.

6.2.2. PW Status Monitoring 
    
   The working status of a PW is reflected by the state of the L2TPv3 
   session. If the corresponding L2TPv3 session is down, both PWES's 
   associated with it MUST be shut down. 
    
   If a control connection is used, and the control channel and the 
   data channels operate in-band, the keep-alive mechanism of L2TPv3 
   can serve as a link status monitoring mechanism for the PWs (i.e. 
   sessions) associated with that control connection. If the control 
   channel and the data channels operate out-of-band, an L2TPv3 data 
   session may be dedicated for sending keep-alive information 
   [Editor's note: details will be provided in the next version of the 
   draft]. 
    
   If one of the PWES is down, Ethernet PWE MUST treat it as an L2TPv3 
   "local close request" and tear down the PW associated with that 
   PWES. When the remote PE cleans the state for the PW, it MUST shut 
   down the PWES associated with it. 
    
6.2.3. Fault Detection & Recovery 
    
   An Ethernet PW can incur loss, corruption, and out-of-order delivery
   of data packets. Packet loss, corruption, and out-of-order delivery 
   can be considered as "generalized packet error" of an Ethernet PW. 
   If the "generalized packet error" rate is higher than a configurable
   threshold, the PW MUST be signaled down with this reason explained 
   in the "Result Code" AVP. The two PWES's MUST also be shut down. 
    
6.3. Management  
    
   An Ethernet pseudo-wire emulation MIB will be defined in a 
   companion draft.  
    
6.4. Security  
    
   Ethernet pseudo-wire emulation does not affect the underlying 
   security issues of L2TPv3 [Section 9, L2TPv3]. 
    
6.5. QoS Consideration  
    
   L2TPv3 provides reliable delivery for control messages. This 
   reliable delivery mechanism is provided at the two L2TPv3 endpoints 
   (i.e., L2TPv3 Control Connection Endpoint, or LCCE). More 
   specifically, this is done by: 
    
     1. Each L2TPv3 will acknowledge receipt of a control message;  
         
     2. If the sender of a control message does not receive an 
        acknowledgement, it will retransmit.  
    
   This reliable delivery mechanism does not rely on any QoS mechanism 
   of the PSN.

Internet Draft      draft-so-pwe3-ethernet-00.txt         October 2001 
 
    
   There is no reliable delivery mechanism for data messages. 
    
   By default, the control and data messages will receive best effort 
   service inside the PSN. It is possible to use DiffServ and other 
   traffic management mechanisms to provide better service quality to 
   these messages. It is also possible to provide better service 
   quality to the control messages than to the data message. What 
   service quality to provide inside the PSN for the control messages 
   and data messages depends on the domain policy of the PSN and is 
   outside scope of this document.

   Point to point services. 
    
   The following is a list of the configuration options for a point 
   to point service, based on the reference points of Figure 3:

                 |               |               |

   --------------|---------------|---------------|------------------  
   5) Tag1-Tag2  | Tag1-Tag2     |               | VLAN can be  
                 |               |               | 0-4095 
                 |               |               | Change of VLAN  
                 |               |               | is not allowed     
   --------------|---------------|---------------|------------------  
    
   Allowed combinations: 
    
   Raw and other services are not allowed on the same physical port 
   (A). All other combinations are allowed, except that conflicting 
   VLANs on (A) are not allowed. 
    
   Notes: 
    
   1) This mode is equivalent to port mode in [Martini-trans] since 
   any packet on the physical port is transmitted as is on the PW and 
   vice versa.  
    
   2) The VLAN mode in [Martini-trans] is an example of service #2. 
   According to the default specification, it does not change the VLAN 
   field.

   3) In draft-martini any change of the VLAN tag is done at the PW 
   egress,in order to support equipment that cannot change the VLAN 
   tag at the PW ingress. However, where possible, it is recommended 
   to change the VLAN tag at the PW ingress, for compatibility with 
   VPLS service requirements(see further details below). 
    
   4) Mode #4 exists in layer 2 switches, but is not allowed when 
   operating with PW since it does not preserve the user's PRI bit, 
   and in order to save configuration of additional service that can 
   be achieved by other set of configuration. If there is a need to 
   remove the VLAN tag (for TLS at the other end of the PW) it is 
   recommended to use mode #2 with tag2=0 (NULL VLAN) on the PW and 
   use mode #3 at the other end of the PW. 
    
   5) Mode #3 can be limited to adding VLAN NULL only, since change of 
   VLAN or association to specific VLAN can be done at the PW outbound 
   side. 
    
   The use of PW for a TLS service is shown in the following diagram:

   Switching (TLS) service (i.e. VPSN) and the allowed relations to 
   the point to point encapsulations format: 
    
   It is assumed that the switching operation requires that the switch 
   ports (see figure 2) will conform to the requirement of 802.1D, 
   i.e. switching and learning is based on VLAN field on the 
   interfaces. Packets without VLAN field or with VLAN NULL may be 
   associated to a VLAN # on a per port/PW virtual interface basis. 
   Not all virtual interfaces of the same TLS instance may have the 
   same VLAN values supported on them, i.e. the forwarding table shall 
   be based on VLAN.

   In order to support HUB and Spoke topology where the PE at the 
   spoke cannot change the VLAN field in order to comply to 802.1D 
   rules, a change of VLAN value may be needed at the adaptation 
   process before the switching operation. 
    
   In most cases, port (A) can be defined as "RAW" and destination of 
   packets may be selected based on the VLAN configuration on the PWs. 
   However, if more than one switching instance is required for the 
   same port, (A) MUST NOT be defined as "RAW" service, and 
   conflicting VLAN ranges between the switching instances cannot be 
   configured in this case. 
    
   Remarks: 
    
   1) Each PW may have different set of VLANs associated with. This 
   enables to view the TLS network exactly the same as Enterprise 
   switch. 
    
   2) Mode #2 with change of VLAN value is allowed for one VLAN only 
   per PW. Recommended new value is 0 (NULL VLAN) on the PW. 
    
   IEEE 802.3x Flow Control Considerations 
    
   If the receiving node becomes congested, it can send a special 
   frame, called the PAUSE frame, to the source node at the opposite 
   end of the connection. The implementation MUST provide a mechanism 
   for terminating PAUSE frames locally (i.e. at the local PE). It 
   MUST operate as follows: 
    
   PAUSE frames received on a local Ethernet port SHOULD cause the PE 
   device to buffer, or to discard, further Ethernet frames for that 
   port until the PAUSE condition is cleared. 
    
   If the PE device wishes to pause data received on a local Ethernet 
   port (perhaps because its own buffers are filling up or because it 
   has received notification of congestion within the PSN) then it MAY 
   issue a PAUSE frame on the local Ethernet port, but MUST clear this 
   condition when willing to receive more data. 
    
    
   MTU Coordination Considerations 
    
   All nodes comprising the PSN shall be configured such that their 
   MTU is greater-than or equal-to the largest Ethernet frame plus PSN 
   tunnel header. If MPLS is utilized as the tunneling mechanism, for 
   example, assuming that there is no label stacking, 8 octets will be 
   typically be added to the largest Ethernet frame size (4 octets for 
   the tunnel label and 4 for the VC label) - creating the 
   encapsulated Ethernet frame size. However, other tunneling 
   mechanisms (i.e. L2TP, IP/GRE) may have longer headers and require 
   larger MTUs.

   Appendix B - QOS details. 
    
   Section 3.7 describes various modes for supporting PW QOS over the 
   PSN.  Example of the above for a point to point VLAN service are: 
    
      1) The classification to the PW is based on VLAN field only, 
         regardless of the user PRI bits. The PW is assigned a 
         specific COS (marking, scheduling, etc.) at the tunnel level. 
       
      2) The classification to the PW is based on VLAN field, but the 
         PRI bits of the user is mapped to different COS marking (and 
         network behavior) at the PW level. Examples are DiffServ 
         coding in case of IP PSN, and E-LSP in MPLS PSN. 
       
      3) The classification to the PW is based on VLAN field and the 
         PRI bits, and packets with different PRI bits are mapped to 
         different PWs. An example is to map a PWES o different L-LSPs 
         in MPLS PSN in order to support multiple COS service over L-
         LSP capable network. 
    
   See the PSN specific sections for supported functionality for 
   different PSN technologies. 
    
   The specific value to be assigned at the PSN for various COS is not 
   specified and is application specific. 
    
   1. Adaptation of 802.1Q COS to PSN COS: 
    
   It is not required that the PSN will have the same COS definition 
   of COS as defined in [802.1Q], and the mapping of 802.1Q COS to PSN 
   QOS is application specific and depends on the agreement between 
   the customer and the PW provider. However, the following principals 
   adopted from 802.1Q table 8-2 MUST be met when applying set of PSN 
   COS based on user's PRI bits.

   2. Drop precedence: 
    
   The 802.1P standard does not support drop precedence, therefore 
   from the PW ingress point of view there is no mapping required. It 
   is however possible to mark different drop precedence for different 
   PW packets based on the operator policy and required network 
   behavior. This functionality is not discussed further here. 
    
    
   3. PSN COS labels interaction with VC label COS marking 
    
   Marking of COS bits at the VC level is not required if the PSN 
   tunnel is PE to PE based, since only the PSN COS marking is visible 
   to the PSN network. In cases where the VC multiplexing field is 
   carried without an external tunnel (for example directly connected 
   PEs in MPLS), the rules stated above for tunnel COS marking apply 
   also for VC level.  
    
   In summary, the rules for COS marking shall be as follows: 
     
    -   If there is only a VC label then, it shall contain the 
             appropriate CoS value (e.g. MPLS between PEs which are 
             directly adjacent to each other).  
              
    -   If the VC label and PSN tunnel labels are both being used, 
             then the CoS marking on the PSN header shall be marked 
             with the correct CoS value. 
              
    -   If the PSN marking is stripped at a node before the PE,     
             the PSN marking MUST be copied to the VC label. An 
             example is MPLS PSN with the use of PHP. 
    
   PSN QOS support and signaling of QOS is out of scope of this 
   document.
