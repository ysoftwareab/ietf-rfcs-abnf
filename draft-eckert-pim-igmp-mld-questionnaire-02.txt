Abstract

   The PIM WG intends to progress IGMPv3 and MLDv2 from Proposed
   Standards to Internet Standards.  This document describes the
   motivation, procedures and questions proposed for a survey of
   operators, vendors and implementors of IGMPv3 and MLDv2.  The
   objective of the survey is to collate information to help the PIM WG
   progress these protocols to Internet Standards.

1.  Introduction

   Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) [RFC3376] and
   Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6 [RFC3810] are
   currently Proposed Standards.  Given the fact that multiple
   independent implementations of these protocols exist and they have
   been successfully and widely used operationally, the PIM WG is keen
   to progress these protocols to Internet Standards.  In order to
   facilitate this effort, it is critical to establish if there are
   features specified in [RFC3376] and [RFC3810] that have not been

Internet-Draft       IGMPv3 and MLDv2 Update Survey        November 2019


   widely used and also to determine any interoperability issues that
   have arisen from using the protocols.

   Following approach taken for PIM-SM, documented in [RFC7063], the PIM
   WG has decided that conducting a comprehensive survey on
   implementations and deployment of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 will provide
   valuable information to facilitate their progression to Internet
   Standard.

   This document describes the procedures proposed for conducting the
   survey and introduces the proposed questions.

2.  Procedures Followed

2.1.  Methodology

   The PIM WG Chairs will officially kick off the survey and distribute
   the questionnaire and pertinent information through appropriate
   forums, aiming to ensure the survey reaches as wide an audience as
   possible.

   An online survey tool will be used in order make the submission and
   processing of returns as convenient as possible.  Therefore, the
   questions proposed in this document will be transcribed to the online
   tool and the URL distributed to potential survey participants.

2.2.  Intended Recipients of Questionnaire

   1.  Network operators

   2.  Router vendors

   3.  Switch vendors

   4.  Host implementors

2.3.  Processing of Responses

   The submitted responses will be collected by a neutral third-party
   and kept strictly confidential.  The published results will be
   anonymized and so the contributions by individual operators, vendors
   or implementors will not be identified.  Therefore, survey responders
   will be identified but they would not be associated with a specific
   response.  Furthermore, there is an option to complete the
   questionnaire anonymously, in which case the responder will not be
   identified in the report.

   Tim Chown has kindly agreed to anonymize the responses to this
   questionnaire.  Tim has considerable multicast expertise but has no
   direct financial interest in this matter nor ties to any of the
   vendors involved.  Tim works at Jisc, who run the UK's national
   research and education network, Janet, and has been active in the
   IETF for many years.
