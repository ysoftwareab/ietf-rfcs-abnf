   There is a need for vendor specific Mobility Header messages so that
   Mobile IPv6 vendors are able to extend the protocol for research or
   deployment purposes.  This document defines a new vendor specific
   mobility header message and a new mobility option.

Internet-Draft       MIPv6 Vendor Specific Messages            June 2006


1.  Introduction

   Vendor specific messages have traditionally allowed vendors to
   implement extensions to some protocols and distinguish themselves
   from other vendors.  These messages are clearly marked by a Vendor ID
   that identifies the vendor.  A particular vendor's implementation
   identifies the vendor extension by recognizing the Vendor ID.
   Implementations that do not recognize the Vendor ID either discard or
   skip processing the message.

   Mobile IPv6 [2] is being deployed and there is a need for vendor
   specific Mobility Header messages so that vendors are able to extend
   the Mobile IPv6 protocol for research or deployment purposes.

   This document defines a new Mobility Header message, the Vendor
   Specific Mobility message that can be sent at any time by the mobile
   node, the home agent or the correspondent node.  Since Mobility
   Header messages cannot be combined and sent in one packet, there is
   always only one Mobility Header message in any Mobile IPv6 packet.
   Home agent or correspondent node implementations that do not
   recognize the mobility message type, discard the message and send
   Binding Error message as described in [2], with the Status field set
   to 2 (unrecognized MH Type value).  Mobile nodes that do not
   recognize the mobility message type should discard the message and
   send an ICMP Parameter problem with code 0.

   This document also defines a new mobility option, the Vendor Specific
   Mobility option, which can be carried in any Mobility Header message.
   Mobility options, by definition, can be skipped if an implementation
   does not recognize the mobility option type [2].

   The messages defined in this document can also be used for NEMO
   implementations [3].

   Vendor specific extensions to protocols can cause serious
   interoperability issues if they are not used carefully.  The vendor
   specific extensions MUST be standardized in the IETF if they are to
   be deployed in a large scale or if multiple vendors are involved in a
   particular system or deployment.  Experience has shown that vendor
   specific extensions benefit from IETF review and standardization.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

3.  Vendor Specific Mobility Header message

   The following illustrates the message format for the Vendor Specific
   Mobility Header message.  The 'MH Type' field in the Mobility Header
   indicates that it is a Vendor Specific Mobility Header message.

   Reserved

      A 16-bit reserved field set to zero by the sender and ignored by
      the receiver.

   Vendor ID

      The SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Code of the Vendor
      as defined by IANA.

   Data

      Vendor specific data that is carried in this message.  The total
      length is indicated by the 'Header Len' field in the Mobility
      Header.


4.  Vendor Specific Mobility Option

   The Vendor Specific Mobility Option can be included in any Mobility
   Header message and has an alignment requirement of 4n+2.

   Type

      A 8-bit field indicating that it is a Vendor Specific mobility
      option.

   Length

      A 8-bit indicating the length of the option in octets excluding
      the Type and Length fields.

   Vendor ID

      The SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Code of the Vendor/
      Organization as defined by IANA.

   Data

      Vendor specific data that is carried in this message.


5.  Security Considerations

   The Vendor Specific mobility messages should be protected in a manner
   similar to Binding Updates and Binding acknowledgements if it carries
   information that should not be revealed on the wire or that can
   affect the binding cache entry at the home agent or the correspondent
   node.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The Vendor Specific Mobility Header message defined in Section 3,
   should have the type value allocated from the same space as the 'MH
   Type' field in the Mobility Header [2].

   The Vendor Specific mobility option defined in Section 4, should have
   the type value allocated from the same space as Mobility Options [2].
