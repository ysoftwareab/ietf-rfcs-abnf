                  OAuth 2.0 Resource Set Registration
                  draft-hardjono-oauth-resource-reg-07

Abstract

   This specification defines a resource set registration mechanism
   between an OAuth 2.0 authorization server and resource server.  The
   resource server registers information about the semantics and
   discovery properties of its resources with the authorization server.

1.  Introduction

   There are various circumstances under which an OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2]
   resource server may need to communicate information about its
   protected resources to its authorization server:

   o  In some OAuth 2.0 deployments, the resource server and
      authorization server are operated by the same organization and
      deployed in the same domain, but many resource servers share a
      single authorization server (a security token service (STS)
      component).  Thus, even though the trust between these two is
      typically tightly bound, there is value in defining a singular
      standardized resource protection communications interface between
      the authorization server and each of the resource servers.

   o  In some deployments of OpenID Connect [OpenIDConnect], which has a
      dependency on OAuth 2.0, the OpenID Provider (OP) component is a
      specialized version of an OAuth authorization server that brokers
      availability of user attributes by dealing with an ecosystem of
      attribute providers (APs).  These APs effectively function as
      third-party resource servers.  Thus, there is value in defining a
      mechanism by which all of the third-party APs can communicate with
      a central OP, as well as ensuring that trust between the
      authorization server and resource servers is able to be
      established in a dynamic, loosely coupled fashion.

   o  In some deployments of User-Managed Access [UMAcore], which has a
      dependency on OAuth 2.0, an end-user resource owner (the "user" in
      UMA) may choose their own authorization server as an independent
      cloud-based service, along with using any number of resource
      servers that make up their "personal cloud".  Thus, there is value
      in defining a mechanism by which all of the third-party resource
      servers can outsource resource protection (and potentially
      discovery) to a central authorization server, as well as ensuring
      that trust between the authorization server and resource servers

      is able to be established by the resource owner in a dynamic,
      loosely coupled fashion.
