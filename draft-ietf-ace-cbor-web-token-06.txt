                    draft-ietf-ace-cbor-web-token-06

Abstract

   CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be
   transferred between two parties.  The claims in a CWT are encoded in
   the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and CBOR Object
   Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added application layer
   security protection.  A claim is a piece of information asserted
   about a subject and is represented as a name/value pair consisting of
   a claim name and a claim value.  CWT is derived from JSON Web Token
   (JWT), but uses CBOR rather than JSON.

1.  Introduction

   The JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] is a standardized security token
   format that has found use in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
   deployments, among other applications.  JWT uses JSON Web Signature
   (JWS) [RFC7515] and JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [RFC7516] to secure the
   contents of the JWT, which is a set of claims represented in JSON.
   The use of JSON for encoding information is popular for Web and
   native applications, but it is considered inefficient for some
   Internet of Things (IoT) systems that use low power radio
   technologies.

   An alternative encoding of claims is defined in this document.
   Instead of using JSON, as provided by JWTs, this specification uses
   CBOR [RFC7049] and calls this new structure "CBOR Web Token (CWT)",
   which is a compact means of representing secured claims to be
   transferred between two parties.  CWT is closely related to JWT.  It
   references the JWT claims and both its name and pronunciation are
   derived from JWT.  To protect the claims contained in CWTs, the CBOR
   Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [I-D.ietf-cose-msg]
   specification is used.

   The suggested pronunciation of CWT is the same as the English word
   "cot".

1.1.  CBOR Related Terminology

   In JSON, maps are called objects and only have one kind of map key: a
   string.  CBOR uses strings, negative integers, and unsigned integers
   as map keys.  The integers are used for compactness of encoding and
   easy comparison.  The inclusion of strings allows for an additional
   range of short encoded values to be used.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].

   This document reuses terminology from JWT [RFC7519] and COSE
   [I-D.ietf-cose-msg].

   StringOrURI
      The "StringOrURI" term has the same meaning, syntax, and
      processing rules as the "StringOrUri" term defined in Section 2 of
      JWT [RFC7519], except that it uses a CBOR text string instead of a
      JSON string value.

   NumericDate
      The "NumericDate" term has the same meaning, syntax, and
      processing rules as the "NumericDate" term defined in Section 2 of
      JWT [RFC7519], except that the CBOR numeric date representation
      (from Section 2.4.1 of [RFC7049]) is used.  The encoding is
      modified so that the leading tag 1 (epoch-based date/time) MUST be
      omitted.

   Claim Name
      The human-readable name used to identify a claim.

   Claim Key
      The CBOR map key used to identify a claim.

   Claim Value
      The CBOR map value representing the value of the claim.

   CWT Claims Set
      The CBOR map that contains the claims conveyed by the CWT.

3.  Claims

   The set of claims that a CWT must contain to be considered valid is
   context dependent and is outside the scope of this specification.
   Specific applications of CWTs will require implementations to
   understand and process some claims in particular ways.  However, in
   the absence of such requirements, all claims that are not understood
   by implementations MUST be ignored.

   To keep CWTs as small as possible, the Claim Keys are represented
   using integers or text strings.  Section 4 summarizes all keys used
   to identify the claims defined in this document.

3.1.  Registered Claims

   None of the claims defined below are intended to be mandatory to use
   or implement.  They rather provide a starting point for a set of
   useful, interoperable claims.  Applications using CWTs should define
   which specific claims they use and when they are required or
   optional.

3.1.1.  iss (Issuer) Claim

   The "iss" (issuer) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and processing
   rules as the "iss" claim defined in Section 4.1.1 of JWT [RFC7519],
   except that the value is of type StringOrURI.  The Claim Key 1 is
   used to identify this claim.

3.1.2.  sub (Subject) Claim

   The "sub" (subject) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "sub" claim defined in Section 4.1.2 of JWT
   [RFC7519], except that the value is of type StringOrURI.  The Claim
   Key 2 is used to identify this claim.

3.1.3.  aud (Audience) Claim

   The "aud" (audience) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "aud" claim defined in Section 4.1.3 of JWT
   [RFC7519], except that the value is of type StringOrURI.  The Claim
   Key 3 is used to identify this claim.

3.1.4.  exp (Expiration Time) Claim

   The "exp" (expiration time) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "exp" claim defined in Section 4.1.4 of JWT
   [RFC7519], except that the value is of type NumericDate.  The Claim
   Key 4 is used to identify this claim.

3.1.5.  nbf (Not Before) Claim

   The "nbf" (not before) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "nbf" claim defined in Section 4.1.5 of JWT
   [RFC7519], except that the value is of type NumericDate.  The Claim
   Key 5 is used to identify this claim.

3.1.6.  iat (Issued At) Claim

   The "iat" (issued at) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "iat" claim defined in Section 4.1.6 of JWT

   [RFC7519], except that the value is of type NumericDate.  The Claim
   Key 6 is used to identify this claim.

3.1.7.  cti (CWT ID) Claim

   The "cti" (CWT ID) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and processing
   rules as the "jti" claim defined in Section 4.1.7 of JWT [RFC7519],
   except that the value is of type binary string.  The Claim Key 7 is
   used to identify this claim.

   | Name    | Key | Value type                   |

   | sub     | 2   | text string                 |
   | aud     | 3   | text string                 |

   \---------+-----+----------------------------------/

5.  CBOR Tags and Claim Values

   The claim values defined in this specification MUST NOT be prefixed
   with any CBOR tag.  For instance, while CBOR tag 1 (epoch-based date/
   time) could logically be prefixed to values of the "exp", "nbf", and
   "iat" claims, this is unnecessary, since the representation of the
   claim values is already specified by the claim definitions.  Tagging
   claim values would only take up extra space without adding
   information.  However, this does not prohibit future claim
   definitions from requiring the use of CBOR tags for those specific
   claims.

6.  CWT CBOR Tag

   How to determine that a CBOR data structure is a CWT is application-
   dependent.  In some cases, this information is known from the
   application context, such as from the position of the CWT in a data
   structure at which the value must be a CWT.  One method of indicating
   that a CBOR object is a CWT is the use of the "application/cwt"
   content type by a transport protocol.

Internet-Draft               CBOR Web Token                    June 2017


   This section defines the CWT CBOR tag as another means for
   applications to declare that a CBOR data structure is a CWT.  Its use
   is optional, and is intended for use in cases in which this
   information would not otherwise be known.

   If present, the CWT tag MUST prefix a tagged object using one of the
   COSE CBOR tags.  In this example, the COSE_Mac0 tag is used.  The
   actual COSE_Mac0 object has been excluded from this example.

   / CWT CBOR tag / 61(
     / COSE_Mac0 CBOR tag / 17(
       / COSE_Mac0 object /
     )
   )

7.  Creating and Validating CWTs

7.1.  Creating a CWT

   To create a CWT, the following steps are performed.  The order of the
   steps is not significant in cases where there are no dependencies
   between the inputs and outputs of the steps.

   1.  Create a CWT Claims Set containing the desired claims.

   2.  Let the Message be the binary representation of the CWT Claims
       Set.

   3.  Create a COSE Header containing the desired set of Header
       Parameters.  The COSE Header MUST be valid per the
       [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] specification.

   4.  Depending upon whether the CWT is signed, MACed, or encrypted,
       there are three cases:

       *  If the CWT is signed, create a COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 object
          using the Message as the COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 Payload; all
          steps specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] for creating a
          COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 object MUST be followed.

       *  Else, if the CWT is MACed, create a COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0 object
          using the Message as the COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0 Payload; all steps
          specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] for creating a COSE_Mac/
          COSE_Mac0 object MUST be followed.

Internet-Draft               CBOR Web Token                    June 2017


       *  Else, if the CWT is a COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0 object,
          create a COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0 using the Message as the
          plaintext for the COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0 object; all steps
          specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] for creating a COSE_Encrypt/
          COSE_Encrypt0 object MUST be followed.

   5.  If a nested signing, MACing, or encryption operation will be
       performed, let the Message be the COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1, COSE_Mac/
       COSE_Mac0, or COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0, add the matching COSE
       CBOR tag, and return to Step 3.

   6.  If needed by the application, add the appropriate COSE CBOR tag
       to the COSE object to indicate the type of the COSE object.  If
       needed by the application, add the CWT CBOR tag to indicate that
       the COSE object is a CWT.

7.2.  Validating a CWT

   When validating a CWT, the following steps are performed.  The order
   of the steps is not significant in cases where there are no
   dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps.  If any of
   the listed steps fail, then the CWT MUST be rejected -- that is,
   treated by the application as invalid input.

   1.  Verify that the CWT is a valid CBOR object.

   2.  If the object begins with the CWT CBOR tag, remove it and verify
       that one of the COSE CBOR tags follows it.

   3.  If the object is tagged with one of the COSE CBOR tags, remove it
       and use it to determine the type of the CWT, COSE_Sign/
       COSE_Sign1, COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0, or COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0.
       If the object does not have a COSE CBOR tag, the COSE message
       type is determined from the application context.

   4.  Verify that the resulting COSE Header includes only parameters
       and values whose syntax and semantics are both understood and
       supported or that are specified as being ignored when not
       understood.

   5.  Depending upon whether the CWT is a signed, MACed, or encrypted,
       there are three cases:

       *  If the CWT is a COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1, follow the steps
          specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] Section 4 (Signing Objects)
          for validating a COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 object.  Let the Message
          be the COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 payload.

Internet-Draft               CBOR Web Token                    June 2017


       *  Else, if the CWT is a COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0, follow the steps
          specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] Section 6 (MAC Objects) for
          validating a COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0 object.  Let the Message be
          the COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0 payload.

       *  Else, if the CWT is a COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0 object,
          follow the steps specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] Section 5
          (Encryption Objects) for validating a COSE_Encrypt/
          COSE_Encrypt0 object.  Let the Message be the resulting
          plaintext.

   6.  If the Message begins with a COSE CBOR tag, then the Message is a
       CWT that was the subject of nested signing, MACing, or encryption
       operations.  In this case, return to Step 1, using the Message as
       the CWT.

   7.  Verify that the Message is a valid CBOR map; let the CWT Claims
       Set be this CBOR map.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security of the CWT relies upon on the protections offered by
   COSE.  Unless the claims in a CWT are protected, an adversary can
   modify, add, or remove claims.

   Since the claims conveyed in a CWT may be used to make authorization
   decisions, it is not only important to protect the CWT in transit but
   also to ensure that the recipient can authenticate the party that
   assembled the claims and created the CWT.  Without trust of the
   recipient in the party that created the CWT, no sensible
   authorization decision can be made.  Furthermore, the creator of the
   CWT needs to carefully evaluate each claim value prior to including
   it in the CWT so that the recipient can be assured of the validity of
   the information provided.

   While syntactically, the signing and encryption operations for Nested
   CWTs may be applied in any order, if both signing and encryption are
   necessary, normally producers should sign the message and then
   encrypt the result (thus encrypting the signature).  This prevents
   attacks in which the signature is stripped, leaving just an encrypted
   message, as well as providing privacy for the signer.  Furthermore,
   signatures over encrypted text are not considered valid in many
   jurisdictions.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims Registry

   This section establishes the IANA "CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims"
   registry.

   Values are registered on a Specification Required [RFC5226] basis
   after a three-week review period on the cwt-reg-review@ietf.org
   mailing list, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts.
   However, to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication,
   the Designated Experts may approve registration once they are
   satisfied that such a specification will be published.  [[ Note to
   the RFC Editor: The name of the mailing list should be determined in
   consultation with the IESG and IANA.  Suggested name: cwt-reg-
   review@ietf.org. ]]

   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
   an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register claim: example").
   Registration requests that are undetermined for a period longer than
   21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the
   iesg@ietf.org mailing list) for resolution.

   Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
   whether it is useful only for a single application, and whether the
   registration description is clear.

   It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are
   able to represent the perspectives of different applications using
   this specification in order to enable broadly informed review of
   registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could
   be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular
   Expert, that Expert should defer to the judgment of the other
   Experts.

9.1.1.  Registration Template

   Claim Name:
      The human-readable name requested (e.g., "iss").

   Claim Description:
      Brief description of the claim (e.g., "Issuer").

   JWT Claim Name:
      Claim Name of the equivalent JWT claim, as registered in
      [IANA.JWT.Claims].  CWT claims should normally have a

      corresponding JWT claim.  If a corresponding JWT claim would not
      make sense, the Designated Experts can choose to accept
      registrations for which the JWT Claim Name is listed as "N/A".

   Claim Key:
      CBOR map key for the claim.  Integer values between -256 and 255
      and strings of length 1 are designated as Standards Track Document
      required.  Integer values from -65536 to 65535 and strings of
      length 2 are designated as Specification Required.  Integer values
      of greater than 65535 and strings of length greater than 2 are
      designated as expert review.  Integer values less than -65536 are
      marked as private use.

   Claim Value Type(s):
      CBOR types that can be used for the claim value.

   Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, list the "IESG".  For others, give the
      name of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal
      address, email address, home page URI) may also be included.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document or documents that specify the parameter,
      preferably including URIs that can be used to retrieve copies of
      the documents.  An indication of the relevant sections may also be
      included but is not required.

Appendix A.  Examples

   This appendix includes a set of CWT examples that show how the CWT
   Claims Set can be protected.  There are examples that are signed,
   MACed, encrypted, and that use nested signing and encryption.  To
   make the examples easier to read, they are presented both as hex
   strings and in the extended CBOR diagnostic notation described in
   Section 6 of [RFC7049].

A.1.  Example CWT Claims Set

   The CWT Claims Set used for the different examples displays usage of
   all the defined claims.  For signed and MACed examples, the CWT
   Claims Set is the CBOR encoding as a binary string.

A.5.  Example Encrypted CWT

   This section shows an encrypted CWT with a single recipient and a
   full CWT Claims Set.

   The encryption is done with AES-CCM mode using the 128-bit symmetric
   key from Appendix A.2.1 with a 64-bit tag and 13-byte nonce, i.e.,
   COSE AES-CCM-16-64-128.  Line breaks are for display purposes only.

A.6.  Example Nested CWT

   This section shows a Nested CWT, signed and then encrypted, with a
   single recipient and a full CWT Claims Set.

   The signature is generated using the private ECDSA key from
   Appendix A.2.3 and it can be validated using the public ECDSA parts
   from Appendix A.2.3.  The encryption is done with AES-CCM mode using
   the 128-bit symmetric key from Appendix A.2.1 with a 64-bit tag and
   13-byte nonce, i.e., COSE AES-CCM-16-64-128.  The content type is set
   to CWT to indicate that there are multiple layers of COSE protection
   before finding the CWT Claims Set. The decrypted ciphertext will be a
   COSE_sign1 structure.  In this example, it is the same one as in
   Appendix A.3, i.e., a Signed CWT Claims Set.  Note that there is no
   limitation to the number of layers; this is an example with two
   layers.  Line breaks are for display purposes only.

A.7.  Example MACed CWT with a floating-point value

   This section shows a MACed CWT with a single recipient and a simple
   CWT Claims Set. The CWT Claims Set with a floating-point 'iat' value.

   The MAC is generated using the 256-bit symmetric key from
   Appendix A.2.2 with a 64-bit truncation.  Line breaks are for display
   purposes only.

Appendix B.  Acknowledgements

   This specification is based on JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519], the
   authors of which also include Nat Sakimura and John Bradley.  It also
   incorporates suggestions made by many people, notably Carsten
   Bormann, Jim Schaad, Ludwig Seitz, and Goeran Selander.

Appendix C.  Document History

   [[ to be removed by the RFC Editor before publication as an RFC ]]

   -06

   o  Addressed review comments by Carsten Bormann and Jim Schaad.  All
      changes were editorial in nature.

      changes:

   o  Say that CWT is derived from JWT, rather than CWT is a profile of
      JWT.

   o  Used CBOR type names in descriptions, rather than major/minor type
      numbers.

   o  Clarified the NumericDate and StringOrURI descriptions.

   o  Changed to allow CWT claim names to use values of any legal CBOR
      map key type.
