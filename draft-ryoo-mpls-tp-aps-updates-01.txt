1.  Introduction

   MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) linear protection in Automatic
   Protection Switching (APS) mode is defined in RFC 7271 [RFC7271].
   The actions being performed at the initialization of the Protection
   State Coordination (PSC) Control Logic are not described in either
   [RFC7271] or RFC 6378 [RFC6378].  Although it is a common perception
   that the state machine starts at the Normal state (but, not
   explicitly specified in any of the documents), various questions have
   been raised concerning the detailed actions that the PSC Control
   Logic should take.

   The state machine described in [RFC7271] operates under the
   assumption that both end nodes of linear protection domain start in
   the Normal state.  In the case that one node reboots while the other
   node is still in operation, various scenarios may arise resulting in
   problematic situations.  This document is intended to resolve all the
   problematic cases and to minimize traffic disruptions related to
   initialization including both cold and warm reboots that require re-
   initialization of the PSC Control Logic.

   This document contains updates to the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-
   TP) linear protection in Automatic Protection Switching (APS) mode
   defined in [RFC7271].  The updates provide rules related to
   initialization of the PSC Control Logic, in which the state machine
   resides, when operating in APS mode.  The updates also include

   modifications to the state transition table defined in Section 11.2
   of [RFC7271].  The changes in the state transition table were
   examined to make sure that they do not introduce any new problems.

   This document does not introduce backward compatibility issues with
   implementations of [RFC7271].  In case a node implementing this
   document restarts, the new state changes will not cause problems at
   the remote node implementing [RFC7271] and the two ends will converge
   to the same local and remote states.  In case a node implementing
   [RFC7271] restarts, the two ends behave as of today.

   The reader of this document is assumed to be familiar with [RFC7271].
   This document shares the acronyms defined in Section 3 of [RFC7271].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Updates

   This document updates [RFC7271] by specifying the actions that will
   be performed at the initialization of the PSC Control Logic and
   modifies the state transition table defined in Section 11.2 of
   [RFC7271].

3.1.  Initialization Behavior

   When the PSC Control Logic is initialized, the following actions MUST
   be performed:

   o  Stop the WTR timer if it is running.

   o  Clear any operator command in the Local Request Logic.

   o  If an SF-W or SF-P exists as the highest local request, transit to
      the PF:W:L or UA:P:L state, respectively.

   o  When the node being initialized has no local request:

      *  If the node being initialized does not remember the active path
         or if the node being initialized remembers the working path as
         the active path, send NR(0,0) in Normal state.

      *  If the node being initialized remembers the protection path as
         the active path, send either NR(0,1) in WTR state or DNR(0,1)
         in DNR state depending on the configuration.

   o  Any local SD MUST be ignored and the detection of a local SD MUST
      be (re-)started after the local node completes the initialization
      and responds to the first protocol message received from the
      remote node.

   o  When the local node receives an EXER message as the first protocol
      message after rebooting and the remote EXER becomes the top-
      priority global request, align the position of the bridge and
      selector with the Path value in the EXER message and transit to
      the E::R state .

   Remembering the active path in case of no local request is intended
   to minimize traffic switchovers in case that the other node is still
   in operation and does not cause any problem even if the remembered
   active path is not valid any more due to any local input at the other
   node while the initializing node is out of operation.

   Note that while the local SD input is being ignored and there exist
   no other local requests, the local node restats with no local
   request.  Since the equal priority resolution stated in Section 7.4
   of [RFC7271] does not converge when the active paths that two nodes
   remember are different from each other.  an SD detection needs to be
   (re-)started after both nodes converge to the same view on their
   active paths.

   It is worth noting that in some restart scenarios (e.g., cold
   rebooting), no valid SF/SD indications may be present at the input of
   the Local Request logic.  In this case, the PSC Control Logic would
   restart as if no local requests are present.  If a valid SF/SD
   indication is detected later on, this would be notified to the PSC
   Control Logic and trigger state change.

3.2.  State Transition Modification

   State transition by remote message defined in Section 11.2 of
   [RFC7271] MUST be modified as follows (only modified cells are
   shown):

           | MS-W    | MS-P    | WTR | EXER | RR | DNR  | NR
   --------+---------+---------+-----+------+----+------+----
   N       |         |         | (13)|      |    | DNR  |
   PF:W:R  |         |         |     |      |    | DNR  |
   PF:DW:R |         |         |     |      |    | DNR  |

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

5.  Security Considerations

   No specific security issue is raised in addition to those ones
   already documented in [RFC7271]
