Abstract

The virtual broadband access server (VBAS) protocol looks BAS and
IP-DSLAM as a whole and provides an applicable method for 
communicating between BAS and IP-DSLAM.

This document describes a communication process, which is added 
in the existing access control modes. It also describes how to 
encapsulate VBAS packets over Ethernet. 

Applicability

This specification is intended to provide the facilities, which are
defined for VBAS.

VBAS Protocol                                    Oct 2003

This specification can support ADSL or VDSL or LAN access modes that
use IP uplink. It is independent of authentication mode.
  
This document describes the VBAS over Ethernet encapsulation that is
being deployed by China Telecom-Guangzhou Research and Development 
Center.

1	Introduction

DSL technologies, which use twisted pairs as transport medium, are 
the dominant broadband technologies for subscribers to access 
broadband services. Broadband deployment has focused on DSLAM in 
the past two years. Traditional uplink interface of DSLAM is ATM 
that is suitable for telecom service providers who have the ATM 
metropolitan area networks. With the DSLAM construction increasing,
the ATM resource is limited and being exhausted. As a result, the
new metropolitan area networks are based on Ethernet and IP-DSLAM
is introduced for DSLAM to link Ethernet metropolitan area networks.

Switches are used between IP-DSLAM and BAS as aggregation network, 
whose VLAN ID is limited (vary from 0 to 4095). Subscribers must 
share a VLAN and the subscribersí¯ detailed information caní¯t be 
sent to the BAS and Radius server. Many issues, such as tracking 
of hackers and security of subscribers etc, emerged in the use 
of IP-DSLAM. 

VBAS protocol adds a communication process between BAS and 
IP-DSLAM, which can get the subscribersí¯ detailed information 
of physical address.

2	Conventions

The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in
this document, are to be interpreted as described in [1].

3	Protocol Overview

There are three access control modes for IP-uplink ADSL 
subscribers: PPPOEíó802.1X and DHCP+WEB. Below PPPOE is 
used for example.

In order to resolving the problems introduced by IP-DSLAM, 
VBAS protocolú¿Virtual Broadband Access Serverú¨is submitted. 
That is, a communication process is added between an IP-DSLAM
and a BAS in the existing authentication process. After a BAS 
sends a PADS packet of PPPOE to a new subscriber, it will 
query the IP-DSLAM about the physical-port information which 
corresponding to the MAC-address of the new subscriber. When 
the IP-DSLAM gets the VBAS Query packet, it will respond a 
VBAS Response packet, which includes the physical-port 
information.

VBAS Protocol                                    Oct 2003

To avoid broadcast packets between BAS and IP-DSLAM in 
network, the communication process is point to point between
 a BAS and an IP-DSLAM in MAC layer. 

4	Payloads

The following packet formats are defined here.  The payload contents
will be defined in the VBAS sections.

An Ethernet frame is as follows:

                                       1
                   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

The DESTINATION_ADDR field contains a unicast Ethernet destination
address. 

The SOURCE_ADDR field MUST contain the Ethernet MAC address of the
source device.

The ETHER_TYPE is set to 0x8200 (suggested for VBAS).

The Ethernet payload for VBAS is as follows:

5.VBAS protocol

There are two stages in VBAS protocol.  When it completes, BAS can get the 
physical address of a new subscriber.  First step is VBAS Query; second 
step is VBAS Response. 

All VBAS Ethernet frames are suggested to have the ETHER_TYPE field set to 
the value 0x8200.

The VBAS communication process is shown in Figure 1, below.

VBAS Protocol                                    Oct 2003

5.1	The VBAS Query Packet
After a BAS send a PADS packet of PPPOE to a new subscriber, it will 
prepare to begin a VBAS session. It generates a unique SESSION_ID for
the VBAS session and sends the VBAS Query Packet to an IP-DSLAM about 
the physical-port information which corresponding to the MAC address 
of the new subscriber.

The Operation Type field MUST be set to 0x1 that indicates it is the 
VBAS query operation. 

The Operation Result field MUST be set to 0x0. The Hardware Interface 
field MUST be set to 0x0.The Source Hardware Address is the MAC address
of BAS. The Destination Hardware Address is the MAC address of the new
subscriber.

If the packet received in PADR stage of PPPOE is untagged, the Source 
Vlan ID field MUST be set to 0xFFFF; If the packet received in PADR 
stage of PPPOE is tagged, the Source VLAN ID field is the same value 
as it in PADR packet of PPPOE.

5.2	The VBAS Response Packet

When an IP-DSLAM gets the VBAS Query packet, it will send a VBAS 
Response Packet to the BAS, which includes the physical-port 
information of the new subscriber. 

The Operation Type field MUST be set to 0x2 that indicates it is the 
VBAS response operation. 

The Operation Result field MUST be set to 0x0 for successful request 
and 0x1 for failure. 

The VBAS Session ID MUST be set the value as it in VBAS Query packet. 

The Hardware Interface field MUST be set to 0x10 for DSL subscriber, 
which is same as the value of NAS-Port-Type defined in RFC 2865. 

The Source Hardware Address is the MAC address of the new subscriber. 
The Destination Hardware Address is the MAC address of BAS. The 
Destination Vlan ID field is the same value of the Source VLAN ID 
field.

The Source VLAN ID field is valid in low 12 bits and contains
the physical-port information of the new subscriber. It is 
transported from BAS to RADIUS Server.

6	Other Considerations

When a BAS does not receive a VBAS Repose packet within a specified 
amount of time, it SHOULD resend its VBAS Query packet and double 
the waiting period. This is repeated many times as desired; 
otherwise the VBAS Query is failed. 

A BAS MUST receives a VBAS Response packet before it began to send 
an authentication access packet to Radius Server; otherwise the VBAS
Query is failed.
