                    draft-hu-lisp-mpls-trans-01.txt

Abstract

   This document proposes an LISP trans solution in MPLS network,
   provides a new LISP data encapsulation with two layer MPLS label and
   simplifies the IP-in-IP encapsulation by cutting of the outer IP
   header when LISP technology deploys in the MPLS network, the outer
   label is used for data forwarding, and the inner label is used to
   indicate the LISP data packet and carry the RLOC address information.
   In additional, three deployment scenarios are provided in this
   document..

Internet-Draft               LISP MPLS Trans                    Jul 2010


1.  Introduction

   It is common recognized that today's Internet routing and addressing
   system is facing serious scaling problems, which is much discussed in
   the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) workshop on Routing and
   Addressing in Amsterdam.  Several proposals have emerged after the
   workshop.  These proposals include LISP [LISP], are based on the idea
   of "ID/Locator split".

   LISP is a network-based ID/locator split solution, and needs a
   mapping mechanism that allows mapping identifiers onto locators.
   There are several mapping mechanisms, such as ALT [ALT], LISP-MS
   [MS], and CONS [CONS], NERD [NERD], APT [APT], etc.  The [ALT] and
   [MS] solution is the recommendation mapping mechanism of LISP
   workgroup.  But the deployment of LISP needs further discussion.
   This document specifics the deployment of LISP in MPLS network.

   MPLS network is widely deployment in current network because of the
   application of VPN service, traffic engineer, QoS etc., so it is
   considered that the label-based switched technology can be used to
   deployment the LISP technology.

   This document specific an LISP trans solution when LISP deploys in
   MPLS network, and provides a new data packet encapsulation format
   that the out IP header of IP-in-IP encapsulation in LISP is cut off.
   There are two layer MPLS label, the outer MPLS label is used to
   forward LISP data packet in MPLS network, and the inner MPLS label
   indicates the LISP data packet and carries the source RLOC address
   information.  The end-to-end MPLS technology can be implemented
   between ITR and ETR.  So the plenty of MPLS services, such as VPN
   service, traffic engineer, QoS etc can be applied when deployed LISP.
   There are three deployment scenarios provided in this document
   according to the role of PE.


2.  Terminology

   Endpoint ID (EID): a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for IPv6) value
   used in the source and destination address fields of the first (most
   inner) LISP header of a packet.  The host obtains a destination EID
   the same way it obtains a destination address today, for example
   through a DNS lookup or SIP exchange.  Usually, the EID is an IP
   address.  If the host is required to support mobility, the EID should
   be unique.

   Routing Locator (RLOC): the IPv4 or IPv6 address of an egress tunnel
   router (ETR).  It is the output of an EID-to-RLOC mapping lookup.

Internet-Draft               LISP MPLS Trans                    Jul 2010


   Label Switch Router (LSR): an MPLS node which is capable of
   forwarding MPLS data packet based on the label forwarding table.

   Label Edge Router (LER): an MPLS node that connects an MPLS domain
   with a node which is outside of the domain, either because it does
   not run MPLS, and/or because it is in a different domain.  If an LSR
   has a neighboring host which is not running MPLS, that that LSR is an
   MPLS edge node.

   Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR): a router which accepts an IP packet with
   a single IP header (more precisely, an IP packet that does not
   contain a LISP header).  The router treats this "inner" IP
   destination address as an EID and performs an EID-to-RLOC mapping
   lookup through a mapping service.  An ITR maintains a local mapping
   table that stores some recently used EID-to-RLOC mapping.  An ITR
   also acts as the LER in MPLS network, it maintains a label forwarding
   table.  When ITR receives a data packet from its custom site, it does
   an EID-to-RLOC mapping lookup, then does a label lookup through the
   label forwarding table by the locator which is the result of EID-to-
   RLOC mapping lookup.

   Egress Tunnel Router (ETR): a router that accepts an IP packet where
   the destination address in the "outer" IP header is one of its own
   RLOCs.  ETR also acts as the LER equipment and setups the point-to-
   point LSP tunnel with the ITR.  ETR distributes a inner label to its
   peer ITR .

   EID-to-RLOC mapping: a binding between an EID and the RLOC-set that
   can be used to reach the EID.  An RLOC-set may contain multiple RLOC,
   and perhaps the preference to an RLOC.


3.   LSP Signaling and Setup

   ITR and ETR act as LER in MPLS network, and there is a point to point
   LSP tunnel between ITR and ETR.  The LSP tunnel is established by the
   signal protocol, such as LDP, RSVP.  If ITR and ETR belong to
   different AS, the LSP tunnel is an inter-As tunnel.  The LISP data
   packets are forwarded along the LSP tunnel.  The LSP should be setup
   between ITR and ETR before requesting EID-to-RLOC mapping and
   performing customer packet forwarding.


4.  LISP label signaling and setup

   It is required for ETR to identify the MPLS packet which encapsulates
   LISP type packet, and identify the source RLOC of the LISP packet.
   For this purpose, there is an inner MPLS label between outer MPLS



Hu, et al.              Expires January 26, 2011                [Page 4]

   label and LISP header to identify the LISP data packet.  When the
   LISP data packet with label encapsulation reaches the ETR, ETR strips
   the MPLS label and gets the LISP data with LISP header, and ETR
   couldn't deal with the data packet if there is no inner label to
   identify the LISP header.

   The inner MPLS label could be distributed by MP-BGP protocol.  The AF
   (address family) of MP-BGP protocol should be extended to support
   inner label distribution function in LER (ITR and ETR).  The LISP
   label will be distributed among ITR and ETR when the LISP function is
   enabled in the peer of ITR and ETR.


5.  MPLS label encapsulation format

   The left figure shows the IP-in-IP encapsulation.  The source and
   destination IP address of outer IP header are RLOC address, and the
   source and destination IP address of inner IP header are EID address.

   This document proposes a MPLS label encapsulation to encapsulate the
   LISP data packet, as shows in the right figure.  There are two layer
   labels, the outer label is used for data forwarding, and the inner
   label identifies the LISP packet.  The outer label is distributed by
   the signal protocol, and the inner label is distributed by extension
   MP-BGP protocol.  The UDP header is cut off in the optimal
   encapsulation format, and the LISP data checksum can be done by CRC
   field of layer 2 header.

6.  EID-RLOC-Label mapping

   EID-to-RLOC mapping is established by the mapping mechanism, such as
   ALT, LISP-MS.  And there is a cache in ITR to record and store the
   recently EID-to-RLOC record.  ITR and ETR belong to the MPLS domain,
   and there is label binding to the RLOC address, so the binding of
   RLOC and label is stored in the ITR.

   When there is data packet (whether IPv4 data packet or IPv6 data
   packet), ITR search the RLOC address in the EID-to-RLOC cache
   according to the EID address, then search the label forwarding table
   to get the outer label of RLOC address.  The inner MPLS label is
   distributed according to the LISP-RD, which carries the information
   of RLOC address.  The ETR distributes different inner label to
   different ITR.  When data packet reaches ETR, ETR can get the RLOC
   address information according to the inner label.

   The original data packet will be encapsulated with an LISP header,
   inner MPLS label and outer MPLS label according to the figure 1.


7.  Deployment scenario

7.1.  Merging PE and xTR function

7.1.1.  Deployment description

   There are three deployment scenarios provided in this document
   according to the role of MPLS PE.  The first scenario is that MPLS PE
   acts as xTR, that is, the ingress PE acts as ITR and egress PE acts
   as ETR.  ITR not only stores and maintains the EID-RLOC mapping in
   the cache, but also sets up the RLOC and outer label binding, and
   maintains the label forwarding table.  Point-to-point LSP tunnel is
   established for LISP data forwarding between ITR and ETR by using the
   current signaling protocol, such as LDP, RSVP etc.  The data
   encapsulation can be optimal as MPLS label encapsulation format in
   figure 1.

7.1.2.  Label-based forwarding

   The LISP data packet in MPLS network will be encapsulated by MPLS
   label, and there is only one layer IP header, and the IP address of
   the IP header is EID address.  The LISP data packet forwards
   according to the outer MPLS label.

   The following is the example of data forwarding process.  The figure
   2 is the network architecture, and it is supposed that host A belongs
   to site A and host B belongs to site B, and host A will communicate

   with host B.

   (1) Host A sends an IP packet (a IPv4 packet or IPv6 packet,
   whatever) to its default ITR.  The destination IP address and source
   IP address of the IP packet are the EID address of host B and host A
   respectively;

   (2) When ITR receives the IP packet, it looks up the RLOC of the EID
   address of host B in the local cache.  If it finds the RLOC, it means
   that the packet is not the first packet, then continue to look up the
   out label of RLOC address, if it does, then skips into step 6
   indirectly; if there is no match RLOC address of EID, it means that
   the data packet is the first packet, then go on with step 3;

   (3) ITR encapsulates the LISP-Request message and sends to the
   mapping system for requesting the RLOC of EID2;

   (4) When the mapping system receives LISP-Request, it looks up the
   RLOC in the mapping database and response the LISP-reply message with
   the right RLOC address;

   (5) When ITR receives the LISP-Reply message, it stores the EID-to-
   RLC mapping into its local cache, and then look up the point-to-point
   LSP tunnel between ITR and ETR.  Note, the point-to-point LSP tunnel
   between ITR and ETR should be already setup before requesting RLOC of
   EID2;

   (6) ITR prepends LISP data packet with label encapsulation as figure
   1.  The destination and source IP address of inner IP header are EID
   address of host A and host B respectively, then ITR sends the data
   encapsulated to the MPLS network.  The data packet forwards with
   label switched;

   (7) When the LISP data packet reaches the ETR, it strips the label
   and gets the original IP packet.  Usually, the outer label is poped
   in the penultimate MPLS node, and ETR only lookup the inner label and
   gets the RLOC address information of ITR;

   (8) The IP packet forwards to the destination host B through site B
   according to the EID address of host B.

7.2.  xTRs act as CE

   The second scenario is the common traditional deployment solution.
   xTRs is the exit router which is located in the edge of customer
   network.  Form the view of MPLS network. xTR acts as CE.  ITR does
   the LISP format with IP-in-IP encapsulation and doesn!_t run MPLS
   technology, and PE does the traditional MPLS encapsulation, which is
   similar with the MPLS BGP VPN.

   The data encapsulation in PE is as following figure.  There are MPLS
   label and IP-in-IP encapsulation.  The outer source and destination
   IP address are the RLOC address of ITR and ETR respectively.  The
   MPLS label is distributed according to the RLOC address of PE, and it
   used for data forwarding in the MPLS domain.

7.3.  Multihoming deployment

   The third scenario is a multihoming deployment solution. xTR locates
   in the custom site.  ITR acts as the CE and multihomes to two or
   several PEs, such as PE1 and PE3 in the following figure.  ITR does
   the LISP data encapsulation .ETR runs MPLS technology.  The core
   network is MPLS network and the data packet forwards based on MPLS
   Label.  ETR and PE1 establish the MP-BGP peer and take use of the
   inter-AS option B to distribute inner label from ETR to PE1.  The
   outer label is distributed in MPLS domain.  It is configured the
   static route from ITR to PE1 and PE3.
