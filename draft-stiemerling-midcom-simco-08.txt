Abstract

   This document describes a protocol for controlling middleboxes such
   as firewalls and network address translators.  It is a fully
   compliant implementation of the MIDCOM semantics described in
   [RFC3989].  Compared to earlier experimental versions of the SIMCO
   protocol, this version 3 uses binary message encodings in order to
   reduce resource requirements.

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


1.  Introduction

   The SImple Middlebox COntrol (SIMCO) protocol serves for controlling
   firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs).  As defined in
   [RFC3234], firewalls and NATs belong to the group of middleboxes.  A
   middlebox is a device on the datagram path between source and
   destination, which performs other functions than just IP routing.  As
   outlined in [RFC3303], firewalls and NATs are potential obstacles to
   packet streams, for example, if dynamically negotiated UDP or TCP
   port numbers are used, as in many peer-to-peer communication
   applications.

   The semantics for the SIMCO protocol are described in [RFC3989].

   SIMCO allows applications to communicate with middleboxes on the
   datagram path in order to request a dynamic configuration at the
   middlebox that enables datagram streams to pass the middlebox.
   Applications can request pinholes at firewalls and address bindings
   at NATs.


1.1.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is fully aligned with the
   terminology defined in [RFC3989].  In the remainder of the text, the
   term SIMCO refers to SIMCO version 3.0.  The term prefix length is
   used as described in [RFC3513] and [RFC1519].  With respect to
   wildcarding, the prefix length determines the part of an IP address
   that will be used in address match operations.


1.2.  Binary Encodings

   Previous experimental versions of SIMCO used simple ASCII encodings
   with augmented BNF for syntax specification.  This encoding requires
   more resources than binary encodings do for generation and parsing of
   messages.  This applies to resources for coding agents and
   middleboxes as well as to resources for executing a SIMCO stack.

   Low resource requirements are important properties for two main
   reasons:

     - For many applications, for example for IP telephony, session
       setup times are critical.  Users do accept setup times only up to
       some limit, and some signaling protocols start retransmitting
       messages if setup is not completed with a certain time.

     - Many middleboxes are rather small and relatively low cost
       devices.  For these, support of resource intensive protocols
       might be a problem.  The acceptance of a protocol on these


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                     [Page 5]

       devices depends among others on the cost of implementing the
       protocol and of its hardware requirements.

   Therefore, we decided to use a simple and efficient binary encoding
   for SIMCO version 3.0 that is described in this document.


2.  Compliance with MIDCOM Protocol Semantics

   SIMCO version 3 is fully compliant with the MIDCOM protocol semantics
   defined by [RFC3989].  SIMCO implements protocol transactions as
   defined in section 2.1.1 of [RFC3989].  All message types defined in
   section 2.1.2 of [RFC3989] are supported by SIMCO and all mandatory
   transactions are implemented.  SIMCO does not implement the optional
   group transactions.  For all implemented transactions, SIMCO
   implements all parameters concerning the information contained.

   SIMCO defines a few new terms to reference functionality in the
   semantics.  Among these terms are Session Authentication (SA) and
   Policy Enable Rule After reservation (PEA) messages.  SA is used to
   model the state transition given in Figure 2 of [RFC3989] from NOAUTH
   to OPEN.  PEA is used to to model the state transition given in
   Figure 4 of [RFC3989] from RESERVED to ENABLED.

   SIMCO implements one additional transaction, the Policy Disable Rule
   (PDR) transaction, to the ones defined in [RFC3989].  PDR
   transactions are used by security functions such as intrusion
   detection and attack detection.  They allow the agent to block a
   specified kind of traffic.  PDRs have priority above Policy Enable
   Rules (PERs).  When a PDR is established, all conflicting PERs
   (including PERs with just a partial overlap) are terminated, and no
   new conflicting PER can be established before the PDR is terminated.
   Support of the PDR transaction by SIMCO is optional.  For a detailed
   description of the PDR transaction semantics see section 8.8.


3.  SIMCO Sessions

   The SIMCO protocol uses a session model with two parties: an agent
   representing one or more applications and a middlebox.  Both parties
   may participate in multiple sessions.  An agent may simultaneously
   communicate with several middleboxes using one session per middlebox.
   A middlebox may simultaneously communicate with several agents using
   one session per agent.

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   SIMCO sessions must run over a reliable transport layer protocol and
   are initiated by the agent.  SIMCO implementations must support TCP,
   while other reliable transport protocols can be used as transport for
   SIMCO as well.  When using TCP as transport, middleboxes must wait
   for agents to connect on port 7626. This port is assigned to SIMCO
   servers by IANA (see http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers).
   The session may be secured, if required, by either IPsec or TLS to
   guarantee authentication, message integrity and confidentiality.  The
   use of IPsec is outlined in Section 9 "Security Considerations".

   The transaction semantics of sessions is explained in [RFC3989]
   Section 2.2.


4.  SIMCO Message Components

   All SIMCO messages from agent to middlebox and from middlebox to
   agent are sent over the transport protocol as specified in Section 3.
   SIMCO messages are Type-Length-Value (TLV) encoded using big endian
   (network ordered) binary data representations.

   All SIMCO messages start with the SIMCO header containing message
   type, message length, and a message identifier.  The rest of the
   message, the payload, contains zero, one, or more TLV message
   attributes.


4.1.  Message Types

   The message type in the SIMCO header is divided into a basic type and
   a sub-type.  There are four basic types of SIMCO messages:
      - request,
      - positive reply,
      - negative reply,
      - notification.
   Messages sent from the agent to the middlebox are always of basic
   type 'request message', while the basic type of messages sent from
   the middlebox to the agent is one of the three other types.  Request
   messages, positive and negative reply messages belong to request
   transactions.  From the agent's point of view, notification messages
   belong to notification transactions only.  From the middlebox's point
   of view, a notification message may also belong to a request
   transaction.  See section 2.3.4. of [RFC3989] for a detailed
   discussion of this issue.

   The message sub-type gives further information on the message type
   within the context of the basic message type.  Only the combination
   of basic type and sub-type clearly identify the type of a message.

4.2.  The SIMCO Header

   The SIMCO header is the first part of all SIMCO messages.  It
   contains four fields, the basic message type, the message sub-type,
   the message length (excluding the SIMCO header) in octets, and the
   transaction identifier.  The SIMCO header has a size of 64 bits.  Its
   layout is defined by Figure 2.

                Message Type

4.2.4.  Message Sub-types for Notifications

   For basic type 0x04, the following values of the sub-type field are
   defined:

      0x01  :  (BFM) badly formed message received
      0x02  :  (AST) asynchronous session termination
      0x03  :  (ARE) asynchronous policy rule event


4.2.5.  Transaction Identifier

   The transaction identifier (TID) is an arbitrary number identifying
   the transaction.  In a request message, the agent chooses an agent-
   unique TID, such that the same agent never uses the same TID in two
   different request messages belonging to the same session.  Reply
   messages must contain the same TID as the request message they
   correspond to.  In a notification message, the middlebox chooses a
   middlebox-unique TID, such that the same middlebox never uses the
   same TID in two different notification messages belonging to the same
   session.


4.3.  The SIMCO Payload

   A SIMCO payload consists of zero, one, or more type-length-value
   (TLV) attributes.  Each TLV attribute starts with a 16 bits type
   field and a 16 bits length field as shown in Figure 3.

4.3.2.  Authentication Attributes

   The authentication challenge attribute and the authentication token
   attribute have the same format.  Both contain a single value field
   with variable length.  For both, the maximum length is limited to
   4096 octets.  Please note that the length of these attributes may
   have values that are not multiples of 4 octets.  In case of an
   authentication challenge attribute, the value field contains an
   authentication challenge sent from one peer to the other requesting
   the other peer to authenticate itself.

   within the field are defined.  The remaining ones are reserved.
      0x80  :  packet filter firewall
      0x40  :  network address translator
      0x10  :  support of PDR transaction
      0x01  :  port translation (requires 0x40 set)
      0x02  :  protocol translation (requires 0x40 set)
      0x04  :  twice NAT support (requires 0x40 set)

   For middleboxes that implement combinations of NAT and firewalls,
   combinations of those flags are possible.  For instance, a Network
   Address and Port Translator (NAPT) with packet filter and PDR
   transaction support, the value of the MB type parameter field is
   0xD1.

   The following four parameters fields are binary flags with a size of
   one bit:
      I     :  internal IP address wildcard support
      E     :  external IP address wildcard support
      P     :  port wildcard support
      S     :  persistent storage of policy rules

   The supported IP version for the internal and external network are
   coded into the IIV (Internal IP version) and EIV (external IP
   version) parameter fields.  They both have a size of two bits.
   Allowed values are 0x1 for IP version 4 (IPv4), 0x2 for IP version 6
   (IPv6), and the combination of both (0x3) for IPv4 and IPv6 dual
   stack.

   The next parameter field with a length of 16 bits is reserved.

   The max policy rule lifetime parameter field specifies the maximum
   lifetime a policy rule may have.

4.3.4.  Policy Rule Identifier Attribute

   The policy rule identifier (PID) attribute contains an identifier of
   a policy rule.  The identifier has a length of four octets.

4.3.7.  Policy Rule Owner Attribute

   The policy rule owner attribute specifies the authenticated agent
   that created and owns the policy rule.  Its value field does not have
   a fixed length, but its length is limited to 255 octets.  Please note
   that the length of this attribute may have values that are not
   multiples of 4 octets.  The owner is set by the middlebox.

4.3.8.  Address Tuple Attribute

   The address tuple attribute contains a set of parameters specifying
   IP and transport addresses.  The length of this attribute is either
   32, 96, or 192 bits.

   The first parameter field has a length of 4 bits.  It indicates
   whether the contained parameters specify just the used protocols or
   also concrete addresses.   Defined values for this field are:
      0x0  :  full addresses
      0x1  :  protocols only

   The second parameter field has also a length of 4 bits.  It specifies
   the IP version number.  Defined values for this field are:
      0x1  :  IPv4
      0x2  :  IPv6

   The third parameter field has a length of 8 bits.  It specifies a
   prefix length to be used for IP address wildcarding (see Section
   1.1).

   The fourth parameter field has also a length of 8 bits.  It specifies
   the transport protocol.  Defined values for this field are all values
   that are allowed in the 'Protocol' field of the IPv4 header [RFC791]
   or in the 'Next Header field' of the IPv6 header [RFC2460].  The set
   of defined numbers for these fields is maintained by the Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) under the label 'PROTOCOL NUMBERS'.

   The fifth parameter field has also a length of 8 bits.  It specifies
   the location of the address.  Defined values for this field are:
      0x00  :  internal (A0)
      0x01  :  inside   (A1)
      0x02  :  outside  (A2)
      0x03  :  external (A3)

   Port and address wildcarding can only be used in PER and PEA
   transactions.  The address tuple attribute carries a port number of 0
   if the port should be wildcarded.  For IPv4 a prefix length less than
   0x20 is IP address wildcarding.  For IPv6 a prefix length less than
   0x80 is IP address wildcarding.

   The port range field must be always greater than zero, but at least
   1.

      - NAT mode
      - port parity
      - requested inside IP version
      - requested outside IP version
      - transport protocol
      - port range

   The attribute value field has a total size of 32 bits.  It is sub-
   divided into six parameter fields.

   The first parameter field called NM has a length of 2 bits and
   specifies the requested NAT mode of the middlebox at which a
   reservation is requested.  Defined values for this field are:
      01  :  traditional
      10  :  twice

   The second parameter field called PP has also a length of 2 bits.  It
   specifies the requested port parity.  Defined values for this field
   are:
      00  :  any
      01  :  odd
      10  :  even

   The third and the fourth parameter field are called IPi and IPo,
   respectively.  Both have a length of 2 bits.  They specify the
   requested version of the IP protocol at the inside (IPi) or outside
   (IPo) of the middlebox, respectively.  Defined values for these
   fields are:
      00  :  any
      01  :  IPv4
      10  :  IPv6

   The fifth parameter field has a length of 8 bits.  It specifies the
   transport protocol for which the reservation should be made.  A value
   of zero indicates that the reservation is requested for an IP address
   without specific selection of a protocol and a port number.  Allowed
   non-zero values are the defined values for the 'protocol' field in
   the IPv4 header and IPv6 extension headers.  The set of defined
   numbers for these fields is maintained by the Internet Assigned
   Numbers Authority (IANA) under the label 'PROTOCOL NUMBERS'.


   The sixth parameter field has a length of 16 bits.  It contains an
   unsigned integer specifying the length of the port range that should
   be supported.  A value of 0xFFFF indicates that the reservation
   should be made for all port numbers of the specified transport
   protocol.  A port range field with the value of 0x0001 specifies that
   only a single port number should be reserved.  Values greater than
   one indicate the number of consecutive port numbers to be reserved. A
   value of zero is not valid for this field.

   Please note that the wildcarding value 0xFFFF can only be used in the
   port range field in the PRR parameter set attribute.  In the address
   tuple attribute, wildcarding of port numbers is specified by the port
   number field having a value of zero (see section 4.3.8).

4.3.10.  PER Parameter Set Attribute

   The policy enable rule (PER) parameter set attribute contains two
   parameters: the requested port parity and the direction of the
   enabled data stream.  The attribute value field has a total size of
   32 bits and it is sub-divided into 3 parameter fields.

   The first parameter field has a length of 8 bits.  It specifies the
   requested port parity.  Defined values for this field are:
      0x00  :  any
      0x03  :  same

   The second parameter field has a length of 8 bits.  It specifies the
   direction of the enabled data stream.  Defined values for this field
   are:
      0x01  :  inbound
      0x02  :  outbound
      0x03  :  bi-directional

   The third parameter field has a length of 16 bits and is reserved.

5.  SIMCO Message Formats

   In the following, the formats of the different SIMCO message types
   are defined.  The definitions are grouped into protocol error
   messages, session control messages, and policy rule control messages.

5.1.  Protocol Error Replies and Notifications

   When processing a received message, the middlebox might run into
   message processing problems before it can identify whether the
   message concerns session control or policy rule control.  Also it
   might not be possible to determine the message type or it might
   detect a wrong message format.  In these cases, the Badly Formed
   Message (BFM) notification or one of the following negative replies
   is sent:

      0x0401  :  BFM notification
      0x0310  :  wrong basic request message type
      0x0311  :  wrong request message sub-type
      0x0312  :  badly formed request


5.1.1.  BFM Notification

   The Badly Formed Message (BFM) notification message is sent from the
   middlebox to the agent after a message was received that does not
   comply to the SIMCO message format definition.  The BFM notification
   has no attributes and contains the SIMCO header only.

5.1.2.  Protocol Error Negative Replies

   Protocol error negative replies are sent from the middlebox to the
   agent if a message cannot be clearly interpreted, because it does not
   comply with any defined message format.  Protocol error negative
   replies include 'wrong basic request message type' (0x0310), 'wrong
   request message sub-type' (0x0311), 'badly formed request' (0x0312).
   These replies have no attributes.  They consist of the SIMCO header
   only.

5.2.1.  SE Request

   The Session Establishment (SE) request message is sent from the agent
   to the middlebox to request establishment of a session.  The SE
   request message contains one or two attributes, a mandatory SIMCO
   version number attribute and an optional authentication challenge
   attribute requesting the middlebox to authenticate itself.

5.2.3.  SA Positive Reply

   If the agent requested middlebox authentication or if the middlebox
   wants the agent to authenticate itself, then the middlebox replies on
   the SE request with a Session Authentication (SA) reply message
   instead of a SE reply message.  The SA reply message contains two
   optional attributes, but at least one of them need to be present.
   The first one is an authentication challenge attribute requesting the
   agent to authenticate itself.  The second one is an authentication
   token attribute authenticating the middlebox as reply on an
   authentication request by the agent.

5.2.4.  SA Request

   The Session Authentication (SA) request message is sent from the
   agent to the middlebox after an initial SE request was answered by a
   SA reply.  The SE request message contains one optional attribute, an
   authentication token attribute authenticating the agent as response
   on an authentication challenge sent by the middlebox in a SA reply.

5.2.5.  ST Request and ST Positive Reply

   The Session Termination (ST) request message is sent from the agent
   to the middlebox to request termination of a session.  The ST
   positive reply is returned acknowledging the session termination.
   Both messages have no attributes and contain the SIMCO header only.

5.2.6.  SE Negative Replies

   There are nine different negative reply messages that can be sent
   from a middlebox to the agent if the middlebox rejects a SE request.
   Three of them are protocol error negative replies (0x031X) already
   covered in section 4.1.2.

   The remaining six negative replies are specific to session
   establishment.  One of them, the 'protocol version mismatch' negative
   reply (0x0322) contains a single attribute, the protocol version
   attribute.

5.3.1.  Policy Events and Asynchronous Notifications

   SIMCO maintains an owner attribute for each policy rule at the
   middlebox.  Depending on the configuration of the middlebox several
   agents may access the same policy rule, see also [RFC3989] section
   2.1.5. and 2.3.4.

   To keep all agents synchronized about the state of their policy rules
   SIMCO generates Asynchronous Rule Event (ARE) notifications.  When an
   agent is reserving or enabling a policy rule, then the middlebox
   sends an ARE to all agents that are authorized to access this policy
   rule.  The middlebox sends an ARE to all agents authorized to access
   this policy rule when the rule lifetime is modified or if the rule is
   deleted.


5.3.2.  PRR Request

   The Policy Reserve Rule (PRR) request message is sent from the agent
   to the middlebox to request reservation of an IP address (and
   potentially also a range of port numbers) at the middlebox.  Besides
   the SIMCO header, the request message contains two or three
   attributes.  The first one is the PRR parameter set attribute
   specifying all parameters of the request except the requested policy
   rule lifetime and the group identifier.  The missing parameters are
   covered by the following two attributes.  The last attribute, the
   group identifier, is optional.

5.3.3.  PER Request

   The Policy Enable Rule (PER) request message is sent from the agent
   to the middlebox to request enabling of data communication between an
   internal and an external address.  Besides the SIMCO header, the
   request message contains four or five attributes.  The first one is
   the PER parameter set attribute specifying all parameters of the
   request except the internal address, the external address, the
   requested policy rule lifetime and the group identifier.  The missing
   parameters are covered by the following four attributes.  Two address
   tuple parameters specify internal and external address tuples.
   Analogously to the PRR request, the last two attributes specify
   requested lifetime and group identifier.  The group identifier
   attribute is optional.

   communication between an internal and an external address.  It is
   similar to the PER request.  There is just one difference.  The
   optional group identifier attribute of the PER request is replaced by
   a mandatory policy rule identifier attribute referencing an already
   established policy reserve rule established by a PRR transaction.

   The group identifier attribute is not included in the PEA request,
   since the group membership of the policy enable rule is inherited of
   the policy reserve rule.


5.3.5.  PLC Request

   The Policy Rule Lifetime Change (PLC) request message is sent from
   the agent to the middlebox to request a change of the remaining
   policy lifetime.  Besides the SIMCO header, the request message
   contains two attributes specifying the policy rule to which the
   change should be applied and specifying the requested remaining
   lifetime.

5.3.6.  PRS Request

   The Policy Rule Status (PRS) request message is sent from the agent
   to the middlebox to request a report on the status of a specified
   policy rule.  Besides the SIMCO header, the request message contains
   just one attribute specifying the policy rule for which the report is
   requested.

5.3.9.  PRR Positive Reply

   The Policy Reserve Rule (PRR) positive reply is sent after successful
   reservation of an address at the inside or outside of the middlebox.
   The message contains four mandatory attributes and an optional
   attribute: the policy rule identifier of the new policy reserve rule,
   the corresponding group identifier, the remaining lifetime of the
   policy rule, the reserved outside address tuple, and the optional
   reserved inside address tuple.  The reserved inside address tuple is

5.3.10.  PER Positive Reply

   The Policy Enable Rule (PER) positive reply is sent after the
   middlebox successfully enabled data transfer between an internal and
   an external address (by using a PER or PEA request message).  The
   message contains five attributes: the policy rule identifier of the
   new policy enable rule, the corresponding group identifier, the
   remaining lifetime of the policy rule, the address tuple at the
   outside of the middlebox, and the address tuple at the inside of the
   middlebox.

5.3.19.  ARE Notification

   The Asynchronous Policy Rule Event (ARE) notification message is sent
   from the middlebox to the agent.  All agents participating in an open
   SIMCO session, that are authorized to access this policy rule and are
   not explicitly requesting an action (i.e., reserving, enabling, and
   changing lifetime) receive such an ARE notification, when:

      - a policy rule is deleted (lifetime attribute = 0)

      - a policy rule is reserved (lifetime attribute = lifetime)

      - a policy rule is enabled (lifetime attribute = lifetime)

      - a policy rule's lifetime changed(lifetime attribute = lifetime)

   Besides the SIMCO header, the request message contains two attributes
   specifying the policy rule which is concerned and the current
   lifetime.

6.  Message Format Checking

   This section describes common processing of all messages that are
   received by a middlebox.  When a message arrives at a middlebox, then
   the header is checked for consistency, before the payload is
   processed.  The middlebox sends a BFM notification if the header
   checks fail.  If a session is already established, then the middlebox
   also sends an AST notification and closes the connection.

   The middlebox waits until is has received as many octets from the
   agent as specified by the message length plus 8 octets (the length of
   the SIMCO header).  If the middlebox is still waiting and does not
   receive any more octets from the agent for 60 seconds, it sends a BFM
   notification.  If a session is already established, then the
   middlebox also sends an AST notification and closes the connection
   after sending the BFM notification, otherwise it closes the
   connection without sending another message.

   After receiving a sufficient number of octets, the middlebox reads
   the transaction identifier and the basic message type.  If the value
   of the basic message type fields does not equal 0x01 (request
   message), then the middlebox stops processing the message and sends a
   negative reply of type 'wrong basic request message type' (0x0310) to
   the agent.  If no session is established, then the middlebox closes
   the connection after sending the 0x0310 reply.

   Then the middlebox checks the message sub-type.  If no session is
   established, then only sub-type 'session establishment' (0x01) is
   accepted.  For all other sub-types, the middlebox sends a reply of
   type  'wrong request message sub-type' (0x0311) to the agent and
   closes the connection after sending the reply.  If a session is
   already established, then the middlebox checks if the message sub-
   type is one of the sub-types defined in section 4.2.2. (excluding
   'session establishment' (0x01), 'session termination' (0x03), and
   'policy rule deletion'(0x15)).  If not, then the middlebox stops
   processing the message and sends a reply of type 'wrong request
   message sub-type' (0x0311) to the agent.

   Then the middlebox checks the TLV-structured attributes in the
   message.  If their type or number does not comply with the defined
   format for this message type, the middlebox stops processing the
   message and sends a reply of type 'badly formed request' (0x0312) to
   the agent.  If no session is established, then the middlebox closes
   the connection after sending the 0x0312 reply.

   After all message format checks are passed, the middlebox processes
   the content of the attributes as described in the following sections.

7.  Session Control Message Processing

   For session control, the agent can send SE, SA, and ST request
   messages.  The middlebox then sends per request a single reply back
   to the agent.  Additionally, the middlebox may send unsolicited AST
   notifications.


7.1.  Session State Machine

   For each session, there is a session state machine illustrated by the
   figure below.

                Figure 41: Session state machine


   The figure illustrates all possible state transitions of a session.
   Request transactions (SE, SA, ST) are denoted by a descriptor of the
   request message, a '/' symbol, and a descriptor of the reply message.
   Notification transactions are denoted just by the a notification
   descriptor.  For example, a successful SE transaction is denoted by
   'SE/SE' and an AST notification is denoted by 'AST'.

   Initially, all sessions are in state CLOSED.  From there, a
   successful SE transaction can change its state either to NOAUTH or to
   OPEN.  From state NOAUTH, a successful SA transaction changes session
   state to OPEN.  A failed SA transaction changes session state from


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 35]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   NOAUTH back to CLOSED.  Successful ST transactions and AST
   notifications change sessions from state NOAUTH or from state OPEN to
   state CLOSED.

   A SIMCO session is established in state OPEN, which is the only state
   in which the middlebox accepts requests other than SE, SA, and ST.


7.2.  Processing SE Requests

   The SE request is only applicable, if the session is in state CLOSED.
   If a session is in state NOAUTH or OPEN, then the middlebox sends a
   negative reply message of type 'request not applicable' (0x0320) to
   the agent, leaving the state of the session unchanged.

   Before processing the content of the SE request message, the
   middlebox may check its resources and decide that available resources
   are not sufficient to serve the agent.  In such a case, the middlebox
   returns a negative reply of type 'lack of resources' (0x0321) and
   closes the connection. Furthermore, the middlebox may decide to
   reject the SE request, if the selected network connection and its
   protocol specific parameters are not acceptable for the middlebox.
   In such a case, the middlebox returns a negative reply of type
   'transport protocol problem' (0x0325) and closes the connection.  The
   middlebox returns a negative reply of type 'security of underlying
   protocol layers insufficient' (0x0326) and closes the connection, if
   the security properties of the network connection do not match the
   middlebox's requirements.

   Processing of an SE request message starts with checking the major
   and minor protocol version number in the protocol version attribute.
   If the middlebox does not support the specified version number, then
   the middlebox returns a negative reply message of type 'protocol
   version mismatch' (0x0322) with the protocol version attribute
   indicating a version number that is supported by the middlebox.
   After sending this reply, the middlebox closes the connection.

   If the agent is already sufficiently authenticated by means of the
   underlying network connection (for instance, IPsec or TLS), then the
   middlebox checks, if the agent is authorized to configure the
   middlebox.  If not, the middlebox returns a negative reply of type
   'no authorization' (0x0324) and closes the connection.

   A positive reply on the SE request may be of sub-type SE or SA.  A SE
   request is sent after both parties sufficiently authenticated and
   authorized each other.  A SA reply message is sent if explicit
   authentication is requested by any party.  The agent requests
   explicit authentication by adding an authentication challenge
   attribute to the SE request message.  The middlebox requests explicit
   authentication by returning a SA reply message with an authentication


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 36]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   challenge attribute to the agent.  If both parties request explicit
   authentication, then the SA reply message contains both, an
   authentication challenge attribute for the agent and an
   authentication token attribute authenticating the middlebox.

   If the SE request message contains an authentication challenge
   attribute, then the middlebox checks if it can authenticate itself.
   If yes, it adds a corresponding authentication token attribute to the
   SA reply.  If it cannot authenticate based on the authentication
   challenge attribute, it adds an authentication token attribute to the
   SA reply message with a value field of length zero.

   If the middlebox wants the agent to explicitly authenticate itself,
   then the middlebox creates an authentication challenge attribute for
   the agent and adds it to the SA reply message.

   If the middlebox replies to the SE request message with a SA reply
   message, then the session state changes from CLOSED to NO_AUTH.

   If the SE request message did not contain an authentication challenge
   attribute and if the middlebox does not request the agent to
   explicitly authenticate itself, then the middlebox sends a SE reply
   message as response to the SE request message.  This implies that the
   session state changes from CLOSED to OPEN.

   The SE reply message contains a capabilities attribute describing the
   middlebox capabilities.


7.3.  Processing SA Requests

   The SA request is only applicable, if the session is in state NOAUTH.
   If a session is in state CLOSED or OPEN, then the middlebox sends a
   negative reply message of type 'request not applicable' (0x0320) to
   the agent.  The state of the session remains unchanged.

   After receiving an SA request message in state NOAUTH, the middlebox
   checks if the agent is sufficiently authenticated.  Authentication
   may be based on an authentication token attribute that is optionally
   contained in the SA request message.  If the agent is not
   sufficiently authenticated, then the middlebox returns a negative
   reply of type 'authentication failed' (0x0323) and closes the
   connection.

   If authentication of the agent is successful, the middlebox checks,
   if the agent is authorized to configure the middlebox.  If not, the
   middlebox returns a negative reply of type 'no authorization'
   (0x0324) and closes the connection.

   If authorization is successful, then the session state changes from

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   NOAUTH to OPEN and the agent returns a SE reply message that
   concludes session set-up.  The middlebox states its capabilities in
   the capability attribute contained in the SE reply message.


7.4.  Processing ST Requests

   The ST request is only applicable, if the session is in state NOAUTH
   or OPEN.  If a session is in state CLOSED, then the middlebox sends a
   negative reply message of type 'request not applicable' (0x0320) to
   the agent.  The state of the session remains unchanged.

   The middlebox replies to a correct ST request always with a positive
   ST reply.  The state of the session changes from OPEN or from NOAUTH
   to CLOSED.  After sending the ST reply, the middlebox closes the
   connection.  Requests received after receiving the ST request and
   before closing the connection are ignored by the middlebox.


7.5.  Generating AST Notifications

   At any time, the middlebox may terminate an established session and
   change the session state from OPEN or from NOAUTH to CLOSED.  Session
   termination is indicated to the agent by sending an AST notification.

   Before sending the notification, the middlebox ensures that for all
   requests that have been processed, according replies are returned to
   the agent, such that the agent exactly knows the state of the
   middlebox at the time of session termination.  After sending the AST
   notification, the middlebox sends no more messages to the agent and
   it closes the connection.


7.6.  Session Termination by Interruption of Connection

   Section 2.2.4 of [RFC3989] describes the session behavior when the
   network connection is interrupted.  The behavior is defined for the
   middlebox (i.e., the SIMCO server) only and does not consider the
   behavior of the SIMCO agent in such an event.

   If the SIMCO agent detects an interruption of the underlying network
   connection, it can terminate the session.  The detection of the
   interrupted network connection can be done by several means, for
   instance, feedback of the operating system or a connection timeout.
   The definition of this detection mechanism is out of scope of this
   memo.

8.  Policy Rule Control Message Processing

   For policy rule control and monitoring, the agent can send the PRR,
   PER, PEA, PLC, PRS and PRL requests.  The middlebox then sends a
   single reply message per request message back to the agent.
   Additionally, the middlebox may send unsolicited ARE notifications at
   any time.

   The transaction semantics of policy rule control messages is
   explained in detail in [RFC3989] Section 2.3.

   For examples about protocol operation see Section 4 of [RFC3989].


8.1.  Policy Rule State Machine

   Policy rules are established by successful PRR, PEA or PER
   transactions.  Each time a policy rule is created, an unused policy
   rule identifier (PID) is assigned to the new policy rule.  For each
   policy rule identifier, a state machine exists at the middlebox.  The
   state machine is illustrated by the figure below.


                        PRR/PRR       +---------------+
          +----+    +-----------------+  PID UNUSED   |<-+
          |    |    |                 +---------------+  |
          |    v    v        PLC(lt=0)/ ^   |            |
          |  +-------------+    PRD     |   | PER/PER    | ARE(lt=0)
          |  |   RESERVED  +------------+   |            | PLC(lt=0)/
          |  +-+----+------+  ARE(lt=0)     v            |    PRD
          |    |    |                 +---------------+  |
          +----+    +---------------->|    ENABLED    +--+
        PLC(lt>0)/    PEA/PER         +-+-------------+
           PLC                          |           ^
                                        +-----------+
              lt = lifetime             PLC(lt>0)/PLC


                Figure 42: Policy rule state machine

   The figure illustrates all possible state transitions of a PID and
   its associated policy.  Successful configuration request transactions
   (PER, PRR, PEA, PLC) are denoted by a descriptor of the request
   message, a '/' symbol, and a descriptor of the reply message.  Failed
   configuration request transactions are not displayed, because they do
   not change the PID state.  Notification transactions are denoted just
   by the a notification descriptor.  For example, a successful PRR
   request transaction is denoted by 'PRR/PRR' and an ARE notification
   is denoted by 'ARE'.  For PLC request transactions, the descriptor
   for the request message is extended by an indication of the value of


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 39]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   the lifetime parameter contained in the message.

   A successful PRR transaction (PRR/PRR) picks a PID in state UNUSED
   and changes the state to RESERVED.  A successful PER transitions
   picks a PID in state UNUSED and changes the state to ENABLED.  A PID
   in state RESERVED is changed to ENABLED by a successful PEA
   transaction.  In state RESERVED or UNUSED, a successful PLC
   transaction with a lifetime parameter greater than zero does not
   change the PID's state.  A successful PLC transaction with a lifetime
   parameter equal to zero changes the state of a PID from RESERVED to
   UNUSED or from ENABLED to UNUSED.

   A failed request transaction does not change state at the middlebox.

   An ARE notification transaction with the lifetime attribute set to
   zero has the same effect as a successful PLC transaction with a
   lifetime parameter equal to zero.


8.2.  Processing PRR Requests

   Processing PRR requests is much simpler on pure firewalls than on
   middleboxes with NAT functions.  Therefore, this section has three
   sub-sections: The first one describes initial checks that are
   performed in any case.  The second sub-section describes processing
   of PRR requests on pure firewalls, and the third one describes
   processing on all devices with NAT functions.


8.2.1.  Initial Checks

   When a middlebox receives a PRR request message, it first checks if
   the authenticated agent is authorized for requesting reservations.
   If not, it returns a negative reply message of type 'agent not
   authorized for this transaction' (0x0341).

   If the request contains the optional group identifier, then the
   middlebox checks if the group already exists.  If not, the middlebox
   returns a negative reply message of type 'specified policy rule group
   does not exist' (0x0344).

   If the request contains the optional group identifier, then the
   middlebox checks if the authenticated agent is authorized for adding
   members to this group.  If not, the middlebox returns a negative
   reply message of type 'not authorized for accessing specified group'
   (0x0346).

   The middlebox may then check the PRR parameter set.  A negative reply
   of type 'IP version mismatch' (0x034F) is returned if the IPi field
   does not match the inside IP version of the address at the middlebox.


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 40]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   A negative reply of type 'IP version mismatch' (0x034F) is returned
   if the IPo field does not match the outside IP version of the address
   at the middlebox.  The requested transport protocol type is checked
   and a negative reply of type 'protocol type not supported' (0x0354)
   is returned if it is not supported.  The middlebox may return a
   negative reply of type 'requested address space not available'
   (0x0347) if the requested address space is completely blocked or not
   supported by the middlebox in any way.  For example, if a UDP port
   number is requested and all UDP packets are blocked by a the
   middlebox acting as firewall.

   The latter check at the middlebox is optional.  If the check would
   fail and is not performed at this transaction, then two superfluous
   transactions will follow.  First, the agent will send a request
   message for a corresponding PER transaction and will receive a
   negative reply on this.  Second, either the agent will send a
   corresponding PLC request message with lifetime set to zero in order
   to delete the reservation, or the reservation will time out and the
   middlebox sends an ARE notification message with lifetime attribute
   set to zero.  Both transactions can be avoided, if the middlebox
   initially performs this checks.

   A reason for avoiding this check might be its complexity.  If the
   check is passed, the same check will have to be performed again for a
   subsequent corresponding PEA request.  If processing two more
   transactions is considered to consume less resources than performing
   the check twice, it might be desirable not to perform it during the
   PRR transaction.

   After checking the PRR parameter set, the middlebox chooses a
   lifetime value for the new policy rule to be created, which is
   greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to the minimum
   of the requested value and the maximum lifetime specified by the
   middlebox capabilities attribute at session setup.  Formally, the
   lifetime is chosen such that

         0 <= lt_granted <= MINIMUM(lt_requested, lt_maximum)

   holds, where 'lt_granted' is the actual lifetime chosen by the
   middlebox, 'lt_requested' is the lifetime requested by the agent, and
   'lt_maximum' is the maximum lifetime specified during capability
   exchange at session setup.

   If there are further sessions in state OPEN with authenticated agents
   authorized to access the policy rule, then to each of these agents a
   corresponding ARE notification with lifetime set to lt_granted is
   sent.

   If the chosen lifetime is zero, the middlebox sends a negative reply
   of type 'middlebox configuration failed' (0x034A) to the agent.

8.2.2.  Processing on Pure Firewalls

   If the middlebox is configured as a pure firewall, then it accepts
   the request after the initial checks.  It establishes a new policy
   reserve rule and assigns to it a policy rule identifier in state
   RESERVED.  It generates a positive PRR reply and sets the attributes
   as specified below.  No configuration of the firewall function is
   required.

   The identifier chosen for the new policy rule is reported in the
   policy rule identifier attribute of the PRR reply.

   If a group identifier attribute is contained in the PRR request, then
   the middlebox adds the new policy rule to the members of this group.
   If the PRR request does not contain a group identifier attribute,
   then the middlebox creates a new group with the new policy rule as
   the only member.  In any case, the middlebox reports the group of
   which the new policy rule is a member in the group identifier
   attribute of the PRR reply.

   The chosen lifetime is reported in the lifetime attribute of the PRR
   reply.

   In address tuple (outside) attribute of the PRR reply, the first
   parameter field is set to 'protocols only' (0x1).  Consequently, the
   attribute has a length of 32 bits.  The IP version parameter field is
   set according to the IPo parameter field in the PRR parameter set
   attribute of the PRR request message.  The prefix length parameter
   field is set to 0x00 and the transport protocol parameter field in
   the address tuple (outside) attribute of the PRR reply is set
   identical to the transport protocol attribute in the PRR parameter
   set attribute of the PRR request message.  The location parameter
   field is set to 'outside' (0x02).


8.2.3.  Processing on Network Address Translators

   If the middlebox is configured as a Network Address Translator (NAT),
   then it tries to reserved a NAT binding.

   The middlebox first checks further the PRR parameter set if the NM
   (NAT mode) parameter matches its configuration.  A negative reply of
   type 'NAT mode not supported' (0x034E) is returned by the middlebox
   if the configuration is not matched.

   Following actions are performed depending on the middlebox NAT type:

      - traditional NAT
        A NAT binding at the outside (A2) with the requested transport
        protocol, external IP version, port range, and port parity is


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 42]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


        reserved.

      - twice NAT
        A NAT binding at the outside (A2) with the requested transport
        protocol, external IP version, port range, and port parity is
        reserved.  Furthermore, the middlebox reserves an inside (A1)
        NAT binding with the requested transport protocol, internal IP
        version, port range, and port parity.

   The identifier chosen for the new policy rule is reported in the
   policy rule identifier attribute of the PRR reply.

   After the checks are successfully performed, the middlebox
   establishes a new policy reserve rule, with the requested PRR
   parameter set, and assigns to it a policy rule identifier in state
   RESERVED.  It generates a positive PRR reply and sets the attributes
   as specified below.

   If a group identifier attribute is contained in the PRR request, then
   the middlebox adds the new policy rule to the members of this group.
   If the PRR request does not contain a group identifier attribute,
   then the middlebox creates a new group with the new policy rule as
   the only member.  In any case, the middlebox reports the group of
   which the new policy rule is a member in the group identifier
   attribute of the PRR reply.

   The chosen lifetime is reported in the lifetime attribute of the PRR
   reply.

   In the address tuple (outside) attribute of the PRR reply, the first
   parameter field is set to 'full addresses' (0x0).  The location
   parameter field is set to 'outside' (0x02).  The IP version parameter
   field is set according to the IPo parameter field in the PRR
   parameter set attribute of the PRR request message.  For IPv4
   addresses the prefix length field is set to 0x20 to indicate a full
   address and the reserved outside IPv4 address is set in the address
   field.  For IPv6 addresses the prefix length field is set 0x80 to
   indicate a full address and the reserved outside IPv6 address is set
   in the address field.  The transport protocol parameter field in the
   address tuple (outside) attribute of the PRR reply is set identical
   to the transport protocol attribute in the PRR parameter set
   attribute of the PRR request message.  The reserved outside base port
   number, i.e., the lowest port number of the allocated range, is
   stored in the port number parameter field and the allocated port
   range is stored in the port range parameter field.

   If the NM (NAT mode) parameter in the PRR parameter set attribute of
   the PRR request message has the value 'traditional', then the PRR
   reply message does not contain an address tuple (inside) attribute.
   If otherwise, it has the value 'twice', then the PRR reply message


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 43]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   contains an address tuple (inside) attribute.  In the address tuple
   (inside) attribute of the PRR reply, the first parameter field is set
   to 'full addresses' (0x0).  The location parameter field is set to
   'inside' (0x01).  The IP version parameter field is set according to
   the IPi parameter field in the PRR parameter set attribute of the PRR
   request message.  For IPv4 addresses the prefix length field is set
   to 0x20 to indicate a full address and the reserved inside IPv4
   address is set in the address field.  For IPv6 addresses the prefix
   length field is set 0x80 to indicate a full address and the reserved
   inside IPv6 address is set in the address field.  The transport
   protocol parameter field in the address tuple (inside) attribute of
   the PRR reply is set identical to the transport protocol attribute in
   the PRR parameter set attribute of the PRR request message.  The
   reserved inside base port number, i.e., the lowest port number of the
   allocated range, is stored in the port number parameter field and the
   allocated port range is stored in the port range parameter field.




8.3.  Processing PER Requests

   Processing PER requests is much simpler on pure firewalls than on
   middleboxes with NAT functions.  Therefore, this section has three
   sub-sections: The first one describes initial checks that are
   performed in any case.  The second sub-section describes processing
   of PER requests on pure firewalls, and the third one describes
   processing on all devices with NAT functions.


8.3.1.  Initial Checks

   When a middlebox receives a PER request message, it first checks if
   the authenticated agent is authorized for requesting middlebox
   configurations for enabling communication.  If not, it returns a
   negative reply message of type 'agent not authorized for this
   transaction' (0x0341).

   If the request contains the optional group identifier, then the
   middlebox checks if the group already exists.  If not, the middlebox
   returns a negative reply message of type 'specified policy rule group
   does not exist' (0x0344).

   If the request contains the optional group identifier, then the
   middlebox checks if the authenticated agent is authorized for adding
   members to this group.  If not, the middlebox returns a negative
   reply message of type 'not authorized for accessing specified group'
   (0x0346).

   Then the middlebox checks the contained address tuple attributes.


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 44]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   If the first one does not have the location parameter field set to
   'internal' (0x00) or if the second one does not have the location
   parameter field set to 'external' (0x03), then the middlebox returns
   a negative reply message of type 'inconsistent request' (0x034B).

   If the transport protocol parameter field does not have the same
   value in both address tuple attributes, then the middlebox returns a
   negative reply message of type 'inconsistent request' (0x034B).

   If both address tuple attributes contain a port range parameter field
   and if both port range parameter fields have values not equal to
   0xFFFF and if the values of both port range parameter fields are
   different, then the middlebox returns a negative reply message of
   type 'inconsistent request' (0x034B).

   Then the agent checks if wildcarding is requested and if the
   requested wildcarding is supported by the middlebox.  Wildcarding
   support may be different for internal address tuples and external
   address tuples.  The following parameter fields of the address tuple
   attribute can indicate wildcarding:

      - the first parameter field
        If it is set to 'protocols only' (0x1), then IP addresses and
        port numbers are completely wildcarded.

      - the transport protocol field
        If it is set to 0x00, then the transport protocol is completely
        wildcarded.  Please note that a completely wildcarded transport
        protocol might still support only a limited set of transport
        protocols according to the capabilities of the middlebox.  For
        example a typical NAT implementation may apply transport
        wildcarding to UDP and TCP transport only.  Wildcarding the
        transport protocol implies wildcarding of port numbers.  If this
        field is set to 0x00, then the values of the port number field
        and the port range field are irrelevant.

      - the prefix length field
        If the IP version number field indicates IPv4 and the value of
        this field is less than to 0x20, then IP addresses are
        wildcarding according to this prefix length.  If the IP version
        number field indicates IPv6 and the value of this field is less
        than to 0x80, then IP addresses are wildcarding according to
        this prefix length.  If the first parameter filed is set to
        'protocols only' (0x1), then the value of the prefix length
        field is irrelevant.

      - the port number field
        If it is set to zero, then port numbers are completely
        wildcarded.  In this case, the value of the port range field is
        irrelevant.


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 45]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   If any of these kinds of wildcarding is used and if this is in
   conflict with wildcarding support for internal or external addresses
   of the middlebox, then the middlebox returns a negative reply message
   of type 'requested wildcarding not supported' (0x034C).

   Please note that the port range field cannot be used for wildcarding.
   If it is set to a value greater than one, then middlebox
   configuration is requested for all port numbers in the interval
   starting with the specified port number and containing as many
   consecutive port numbers as specified by the parameter.

   If the direction parameter field in the PER parameter set attribute
   has the value 'bi-directional', then only transport protocol
   wildcarding is allowed.  If any other kind of wildcarding is
   specified in one or both of the IP address tuple attributes, then the
   middlebox returns a negative reply message of type 'inconsistent
   request' (0x034B).

   If the PER request conflicts with any policy disable rule (see
   Section 8.8.1) then the middlebox returns a negative reply message of
   type 'conflict with existing rule' (0x0350).

   After checking the address tuple attributes, the middlebox chooses a
   lifetime value for the new policy rule to be created, which is
   greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to the minimum
   of the requested value and the maximum lifetime specified by the
   middlebox capabilities attribute at session setup.  Formally, the
   lifetime is chosen such that

         0 <= lt_granted <= MINIMUM(lt_requested, lt_maximum)

   holds, where 'lt_granted' is the actual lifetime chosen by the
   middlebox, 'lt_requested' is the lifetime requested by the agent, and
   'lt_maximum' is the maximum lifetime specified during capability
   exchange at session setup.

   If there are further sessions in state OPEN with authenticated agents
   authorized to access the policy rule, then to each of these agents a
   corresponding ARE notification with lifetime set to lt_granted is
   sent.

   If the chosen lifetime is zero, the middlebox sends a negative reply
   of type 'middlebox configuration failed' (0x034A) to the agent.


8.3.2.  Processing on Pure Firewalls

   If the middlebox is acting as a pure firewall, then it tries to
   configure the requested pinhole.  The firewall configuration ignores
   the port parity parameter field in the PER parameter set attribute,


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 46]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   but it considers the direction parameter field in this attribute.
   The pinhole is configured such that communication between the
   specified internal and external address tuples is enabled in the
   specified direction and covering the specified wildcarding.  If the
   configuration fails, for example because the pinhole would conflict
   with high-level firewall policies, then the middlebox returns a
   negative reply message of type 'middlebox configuration failed'
   (0x034A).

   If the configuration was successful, the middlebox establishes a new
   policy enable rule and assigns to it a policy rule identifier in
   state ENABLED.  It generates a positive PER reply and sets the
   attributes as specified below.

   The identifier chosen for the new policy rule is reported in the
   policy rule identifier attribute of the PER reply.

   If a group identifier attribute is contained in the PER request, then
   the middlebox adds the new policy rule to the members of this group.
   If the PRR request does not contain a group identifier attribute,
   then the middlebox creates a new group with the new policy rule as
   the only member.  In any case, the middlebox reports the group of
   which the new policy rule is a member in the group identifier
   attribute of the PER reply.

   The chosen lifetime is reported in the lifetime attribute of the PER
   reply.

   The address tuple (internal) attribute of the PER request is reported
   as address tuple (outside) attribute of the PER reply.  The address
   tuple (external) attribute of the PER request is reported as address
   tuple (inside) attribute of the PER reply.


8.3.3.  Processing on Network Address Translators

   If the middlebox is configured as a NAT, then it tries to configure
   the requested NAT binding.  The action taken by the NAT are quite
   similar to the actions of the Policy Reserve Rule (PRR) request, but
   in the PER request a NAT binding is enabled.

   Following actions are performed depending on the middlebox NAT type

      - traditional NAT
        A NAT binding is established between the internal and external
        address tuple with the requested transport protocol, port range,
        direction, and port parity.  The outside address tuple is
        created.

      - twice NAT
        A NAT binding is established between the internal and external
        address tuple with the requested transport protocol, port range,
        and port parity.  But two address tuples are created: An outside
        address tuple and an inside address tuple.

   Should in either NAT case the configuration fail, a negative reply
   'middlebox configuration failed' (0x034A) is returned.

   If the configuration was successful, the middlebox establishes a new
   policy enable rule and assigns to it a policy rule identifier in
   state ENABLED.  It generates a positive PER reply and sets the
   attributes as specified below.

   The identifier chosen for the new policy rule is reported in the
   policy rule identifier attribute of the PER reply.

   If a group identifier attribute is contained in the PER request, then
   the middlebox adds the new policy rule to the members of this group.
   If the PRR request does not contain a group identifier attribute,
   then the middlebox creates a new group with the new policy rule as
   the only member.  In any case, the middlebox reports the group of
   which the new policy rule is a member in the group identifier
   attribute of the PER reply.

   The chosen lifetime is reported in the lifetime attribute of the PER
   reply.

   In the address tuple (outside) attribute of the PER reply, the first
   parameter field is set to 'full addresses' (0x0).  The location
   parameter field is set to 'outside' (0x02).  The IP version parameter
   field is set according to the IP version parameter field in the PER
   parameter set attribute of the PER request message.  For IPv4
   addresses the prefix length field is set to 0x20 to indicate a full
   address and the reserved outside IPv4 address is set in the address
   field.  For IPv6 addresses the prefix length field is set 0x80 to
   indicate a full address and the reserved outside IPv6 address is set
   in the address field.  The transport protocol parameter field in the
   address tuple (outside) attribute of the PER reply is set identical
   to the transport protocol attribute in the PER parameter set
   attribute of the PER request message.  The reserved outside base port
   number, i.e., the lowest port number of the allocated range, is
   stored in the port number parameter field and the allocated port
   range is stored in the port range parameter field.

   The address tuple (inside) is only returned if the middlebox is a
   twice NAT, otherwise it is omitted.  In the address tuple (inside)
   attribute of the PER reply, the first parameter field is set to 'full
   addresses' (0x0).  The location parameter field is set to 'inside'
   (0x01).  The IP version parameter field is set according to the IP


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 48]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   version  parameter field in the PER parameter set attribute of the
   PER request message.  For IPv4 addresses the prefix length field is
   set to 0x20 to indicate a full address and the reserved inside IPv4
   address is set in the address field.  For IPv6 addresses the prefix
   length field is set 0x80 to indicate a full address and the reserved
   inside IPv6 address is set in the address field.  The transport
   protocol parameter field in the address tuple (inside) attribute of
   the PER reply is set identical to the transport protocol attribute in
   the PER parameter set attribute of the PER request message.  The
   reserved inside base port number, i.e., the lowest port number of the
   allocated range, is stored in the port number parameter field and the
   allocated port range is stored in the port range parameter field.



8.3.4.  Processing on combined Firewalls and NATs

   Middleboxes that are combinations of firewall and NAT are configured
   in such a way that first the NAT bindings are configured and
   afterwards the firewall pinholes. This sequence is needed since the
   firewall rules must be configured accordingly to the outside address
   tuples and for twice NATs the inside address tuples as well.  This
   aspect of middlebox operation may be irrelevant to SIMCO, since some
   NATs already do firewall configuration on their own.



8.4.  Processing PEA Requests

   Processing PEA requests is much simpler on pure firewalls than on
   middleboxes with NAT functions.  Therefore, this section has three
   sub-sections: The first one describes initial checks that are
   performed in any case.  The second sub-section describes processing
   of PEA requests on pure firewalls, and the third one describes
   processing on all devices with NAT functions.


8.4.1.  Initial Checks

   When a middlebox receives a PEA request message, it first checks if
   the authenticated agent is authorized for requesting middlebox
   configurations for enabling communication.  If not, it returns a
   negative reply message of type 'agent not authorized for this
   transaction' (0x0341).

   Then the middlebox checks the policy rule identifier attribute
   contained in the PEA message.  If no policy rule with this identifier
   exists, then the middlebox returns a negative reply message of type
   'specified policy rule does not exist' (0x0343).  If there exists a
   policy with this identifier and if it is in a state other than


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 49]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   RESERVED, then the middlebox returns a negative reply message of type
   'inconsistent request' (0x034B).

   If a policy rule with this identifier exists, but the authenticated
   agent is not authorized for terminating this policy reserve rule,
   then the middlebox returns a negative reply message of type 'agent
   not authorized for accessing this policy' (0x0345).

   Then the middlebox checks the contained address tuple attributes.

   If the first one does not have the location parameter field set to
   'internal' (0x00) or if the second one does not have the location
   parameter field set to 'external' (0x03), then the middlebox returns
   a negative reply message of type 'inconsistent request' (0x034B).

   If the transport protocol parameter field does not have the same
   value in both address tuple attributes, then the middlebox returns a
   negative reply message of type 'inconsistent request' (0x034B).

   If both address tuple attributes contain a port range parameter field
   and if both port range parameter fields have values not equal to
   0xFFFF and if the values of both port range parameter fields are
   different, then the middlebox returns a negative reply message of
   type 'inconsistent request' (0x034B).

   Then the agent checks if wildcarding is requested and if the
   requested wildcarding is supported by the middlebox.  Wildcarding
   support may be different for internal address tuples and external
   address tuples.  The following parameter fields of the address tuple
   attribute can indicate wildcarding:

      - the first parameter field
        If it is set to 'protocols only' (0x1), then IP addresses and
        port numbers are completely wildcarded.

      - the transport protocol field
        If it is set to 0x00, then IP the transport protocol is
        completely wildcarded.  Please note that a completely wildcarded
        transport protocol might still support only a limited set of
        transport protocols according to the capabilities of the
        middlebox.  For example a typical NAT implementation may apply
        transport wildcarding to UDP and TCP transport only.

      - the prefix length field
        If the IP version number field indicates IPv4 and the value of
        this field is less than to 0x20, then IP addresses are
        wildcarding according to this prefix length.  If the IP version
        number field indicates IPv6 and the value of this field is less
        than to 0x80, then IP addresses are wildcarding according to
        this prefix length.  If the first parameter field is set to


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 50]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


        'protocols only' (0x1), then the value of the prefix length
        field is irrelevant.

      - the port number field
        If it is set to zero, then port numbers are completely
        wildcarded.

      - the port range field
        If it is set to a value greater than one, then port numbers are
        wildcarded within an interval starting with the specified port
        number and containing as many consecutive port numbers as
        specified by the parameter.

   If any of these kinds of wildcarding is used and if this is in
   conflict with wildcarding support for internal or external addresses
   of the middlebox, then the middlebox returns a negative reply message
   of type 'requested wildcarding not supported' (0x034C).

   If the PEA request conflicts with any policy disable rule (see
   Section 8.8.1) then the middlebox returns a negative reply message of
   type 'conflict with existing rule' (0x0350).

   After checking the address tuple attributes, the middlebox chooses a
   lifetime value for the new policy enable rule to be created, which is
   greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to the minimum
   of the requested value and the maximum lifetime specified by the
   middlebox capabilities attribute at session setup.  Formally, the
   lifetime is chosen such that

         0 <= lt_granted <= MINIMUM(lt_requested, lt_maximum)

   holds, where 'lt_granted' is the actual lifetime chosen by the
   middlebox, 'lt_requested' is the lifetime requested by the agent, and
   'lt_maximum' is the maximum lifetime specified during capability
   exchange at session setup.

   If there are further sessions in state OPEN with authenticated agents
   authorized to access the policy rule, then to each of these agents a
   corresponding ARE notification with lifetime set to lt_granted is
   sent.

   If the chosen lifetime is zero, the middlebox sends a negative reply
   of type 'middlebox configuration failed' (0x034A) to the agent.


8.4.2.  Processing on Pure Firewalls

   If the middlebox is configured as a pure firewall, then it tries to
   configure the requested pinhole.  The firewall configuration ignores
   the port parity parameter field in the PER parameter set attribute,


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 51]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   but it considers the direction parameter field in this attribute.
   The pinhole is configured such that communication between the
   specified internal and external address tuples is enabled in the
   specified direction and covering the specified wildcarding.  If the
   configuration fails, then the middlebox returns a negative reply
   message of type 'middlebox configuration failed' (0x034A).

   If the configuration was successful, the middlebox replaces the
   policy reserve rule referenced by the policy rule identifier
   attribute in the PEA request message by a new policy enable rule.
   The policy enable rule re-uses the policy rule identifier of the
   replaced policy reserve rule.  The state of the policy rule
   identifier changes from RESERVED to ENABLED.  The policy reserve rule
   is member of the same group as the replaced policy reserve rule was.

   Then the middlebox generates a positive PER reply and sets the
   attributes as specified below.

   The identifier chosen for the new policy rule is reported in the
   policy rule identifier attribute of the PER reply.

   The group identifier is reported in the group identifier attribute of
   the PER reply.

   The chosen lifetime is reported in the lifetime attribute of the PER
   reply.

   The address tuple (internal) attribute of the PER request is reported
   as address tuple (outside) attribute of the PER reply.  The address
   tuple (external) attribute of the PER request is reported as address
   tuple (inside) attribute of the PER reply.


8.4.3.  Processing on Network Address Translators

   If the middlebox is configured as a NAT, then it tries to configure
   the requested NAT binding, i.e., enabling the already reserved
   binding.  The already reserved NAT binding from the PRR request is
   now enabled in the middlebox.

   If the enable configuration was successful, the middlebox replaces
   the policy reserve rule referenced by the policy rule identifier
   attribute in the PEA request message by a new policy enable rule.
   The policy enable rule re-uses the policy rule identifier of the
   replaced policy reserve rule.  The state of the policy rule
   identifier changes from RESERVED to ENABLED.  The policy reserve rule
   is member of the same group as the replaced policy reserve rule was.

   Then the middlebox generates a positive PER reply and sets the
   attributes as specified below.


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 52]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   The reserved outside address tuple is reported as address tuple
   (outside) attribute of the PER reply.  The reserved inside address
   tuple  is reported as address tuple (inside) attribute of the PER
   reply.  Both reserved outside and inside address tuples are taken
   from the reserve policy rule generated during the PRR transaction.


8.5.  Processing PLC Requests

   When a middlebox receives a PLC request message, it first checks if
   the authenticated agent is authorized for requesting policy rule
   lifetime changes.  If not, it returns a negative reply message of
   type 'agent not authorized for this transaction' (0x0341).

   Then the middlebox checks the policy rule identifier attribute
   contained in the PLC message.  If no policy rule with this identifier
   exists, then the middlebox returns a negative reply message of type
   'specified policy rule does not exist' (0x0343).

   If a policy rule with this identifier exists, but the authenticated
   agent is not authorized for changing the lifetime of this policy
   rule, then the middlebox returns a negative reply message of type
   'agent not authorized for accessing this policy' (0x0345).

   Then the middlebox chooses a lifetime value for the new policy rule,
   which is greater than zero and less than or equal to the minimum of
   the requested value and the maximum lifetime specified by the
   middlebox capabilities attribute at session setup.  Formally, the
   lifetime is chosen such that

         0 <= lt_granted <= MINIMUM(lt_requested, lt_maximum)

   holds, where 'lt_granted' is the actual lifetime chosen by the
   middlebox, 'lt_requested' is the lifetime requested by the agent, and
   'lt_maximum' is the maximum lifetime specified during capability
   exchange at session setup.  This procedure implies that the chosen
   lifetime is zero, if the requested lifetime is zero.

   If the chosen lifetime is greater than zero, the middlebox changes
   the lifetime of the policy rule to the chosen value and generates a
   PLC reply message.  The chosen lifetime is reported in the lifetime
   attribute of the message.

   If otherwise the chosen lifetime is zero, then the middlebox
   terminates the policy rule changes the PID state from ENABLED or
   RESERVED, respectively, to UNUSED.

   The middlebox generates a PRD reply message and sends it to the
   requesting agent.  If there are further sessions in state OPEN with
   authenticated agents authorized to access the policy rule, then to


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 53]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   each of these agents a corresponding ARE notification with lifetime
   set to zero is sent.


8.6.  Processing PRS Requests

   When a middlebox receives a PRS request message, it first checks if
   the authenticated agent is authorized for receiving policy status
   information.  If not, it returns a negative reply message of type
   'agent not authorized for this transaction' (0x0341).

   Then the middlebox checks the policy rule identifier attribute
   contained in the PRS message.  If no policy rule with this identifier
   exists in state RESERVED or ENABLED, then the middlebox returns a
   negative reply message of type 'specified policy rule does not exist'
   (0x0343).

   If a policy rule with this identifier exists, but the authenticated
   agent is not authorized receiving status information for this policy
   rule, then the middlebox returns a negative reply message of type
   'agent not authorized for accessing this policy' (0x0345).

   If the checks describes above are passed, the middlebox accepts the
   requests and generates a reply.  If the policy rule for which status
   information is requested is in state RESERVED, then a PRS reply is
   generated and sent to the agent.  If otherwise the policy rule is in
   state ENABLED, then a PES reply is generated and sent to the agent.
   For policy disable rules a PDS reply is generated and sent to the
   agent.

   In both message formats, the lifetime attribute reports the current
   remaining lifetime of the policy rule, and the owner attribute
   reports the owner of the policy rule for which status information is
   requested.

   The PRS reply message format is identical to the PRR reply message
   format except of an appended owner attribute.  In the PRS reply, the
   attributes which are common with the PRR reply - except for the
   lifetime attribute - have exactly the same values as the
   corresponding attributes of the the PRR reply that was sent as part
   of the PRR transaction that established the policy reserve rule.

   In the PES reply message, the PER parameter set attribute, the
   address tuple (internal) attribute, and the address tuple (external)
   attribute have exactly the same values as the corresponding
   attributes of the PER or PEA request that were sent as part of the
   corresponding transaction that established the policy enable rule.

   In the PES reply message, the policy rule identifier attribute, the
   group identifier attribute, the address tuple (inside) attribute, and


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 54]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   the address tuple (outside) attribute have exactly the same values as
   the corresponding attributes of the PER reply that was sent as part
   of the PER or PEA transaction that established the policy enable
   rule.

   In the PDS reply message, the policy rule identifier attribute, the
   address tuple (internal) attribute, and the address tuple (external)
   attribute have exactly the same values as the corresponding
   attributes of the PDR request message.

   This transaction does not change the state of any policy rule.


8.7.  Processing PRL Requests

   When a middlebox receives a PRL request message, it first checks if
   the authenticated agent is authorized for receiving policy
   information.  If not, it returns a negative reply message of type
   'agent not authorized for this transaction' (0x0341).

   Then the middlebox generates a PRL reply message.  For each policy
   rule at the middlebox in state RESERVED or ENABLED, which the
   authenticated agent can access, a policy rule identifier attribute is
   generated and added to the PRL reply message before the message is
   sent to the agent.  A negative reply message of type 'reply message
   too big' (0x0313) is generated, if the number of policy rule
   attributes to be returned exceeds the maximum transport unit size of
   the underlying network connection or the maximum length of a SIMCO
   message. The total size of a SIMCO message is limited to 65,536 in
   total (see Section 4.2 for the SIMCO header).

   This transaction does not change the state of any policy rule.


8.8.  Processing PDR requests

   Processing of PDR requests is structured into five sub-sections: The
   first one describes the general extension of the MIDCOM protocol
   semantics by PDR.  The second sub-section describes the initial
   checks that are performed in any case.  The third sub-section
   describes the processing of PDR requests on pure firewalls, the
   fourth one describes processing on devices with NATs and the fifth
   sub-section describes processing of devices with combined firewall
   and NAT functions.


8.8.1.  Extending the MIDCOM semantics

   The Policy Disable Rule (PDR) extends the MIDCOM protocol semantics
   [RFC3989] by another policy rule type.  The PDR is intended to be


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 55]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   used for dynamically blocking unwanted traffic, particularly in case
   of an attack, for example a distributed denial of service attack.

   PDR requests follow the same ownership concept as all other
   transactions do (see [RFC3989], section 2.1.5).  However, PDR
   prioritization over PERs is independent of ownership.  A PDR always
   overrules a conflicting PER, even if the respective owners are
   different.  Typically, only a highly privileged agent will be allowed
   to issue PDR requests.

   A PDR rule and PER rule conflict with each other, if their address
   tuples overlap, such that there exists at least one IP packet that
   matches address tuple A0 of both rules in the internal network and
   that matches address tuple A3 of both rules in the external network.
   Note that the packet may be translated from the internal to external
   network or vice versa.

   Lets assume, for instance, a policy enable rule (PER) enabling all
   traffic from any external host using any UDP port to a certain UDP
   port of a certain internal host:

         PER A3={ any external IP address,      UDP, any port   }
         PER A0={ internal IP address 10.1.8.3, UDP, port 12345 }

   Then this conflicts with a policy disable rule (PDR) blocking all UDP
   traffic from a potentially attacking host:

         PDR A3={ external IP address 192.0.2.100, UDP, any port }
         PDR A0={ any internal IP address,         UDP, any port }

   If a new PDR is established, then all conflicting PERS are terminated
   immediately.  A new PER can only be established, if it does not
   conflict with any already existing PDR.


8.8.2.  Initial Checks

   When a middlebox receives a PDR request message, it first checks if
   the authenticated agent is authorized for requesting middlebox
   configurations for disabling communication.  If not, it returns a
   negative reply message of type 'agent not authorized for this
   transaction' (0x0341).

   Then the middlebox checks the contained address tuple attributes.

   If the first one does not have the location parameter field set to
   'internal' (0x00) or if the second one does not have the location
   parameter field set to 'external' (0x03), then the middlebox returns
   a negative reply message of type 'inconsistent request' (0x034B).



Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 56]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   If the transport protocol parameter field does not have the same
   value in both address tuple attributes, then the middlebox returns a
   negative reply message of type 'inconsistent request' (0x034B).

   If both address tuple attributes contain a port range parameter field
   and if both port range parameter fields have values not equal to
   0xFFFF and if the values of both port range parameter fields are
   different, then the middlebox returns a negative reply message of
   type 'inconsistent request' (0x034B).

   Then the agent checks if wildcarding is requested and if the
   requested wildcarding is supported by the middlebox.  Wildcarding
   support may be different for internal address tuples and external
   address tuples.  The following parameter fields of the address tuple
   attribute can indicate wildcarding:

      - the first parameter field
        If it is set to 'protocols only' (0x1), then IP addresses and
        port numbers are completely wildcarded.

      - the transport protocol field
        If it is set to 0x00, then the transport protocol is completely
        wildcarded.  Please note that a completely wildcarded transport
        protocol might still support only a limited set of transport
        protocols according to the capabilities of the middlebox.  For
        example a typical NAT implementation may apply transport
        wildcarding to UDP and TCP transport only.  Wildcarding the
        transport protocol implies wildcarding of port numbers.  If this
        field is set to 0x00, then the values of the port number field
        and the port range field are irrelevant.

      - the prefix length field
        If the IP version number field indicates IPv4 and the value of
        this field is less than to 0x20, then IP addresses are
        wildcarding according to this prefix length.  If the IP version
        number field indicates IPv6 and the value of this field is less
        than to 0x80, then IP addresses are wildcarding according to
        this prefix length.  If the first parameter filed is set to
        'protocols only' (0x1), then the value of the prefix length
        field is irrelevant.

      - the port number field
        If it is set to zero, then port numbers are completely
        wildcarded.  In this case, the value of the port range field is
        irrelevant.

   If any of these kinds of wildcarding is used and if this is in
   conflict with wildcarding support for internal or external addresses
   of the middlebox, then the middlebox returns a negative reply message
   of type 'requested wildcarding not supported' (0x034C).


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 57]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   Please note that the port range field cannot be used for wildcarding.
   If it is set to a value greater than one, then middlebox
   configuration is requested for all port numbers in the interval
   starting with the specified port number and containing as many
   consecutive port numbers as specified by the parameter.

   The specified policy disable rule is activated and the middlebox will
   terminate any conflicting policy enable rule immediately.  Conflicts
   are defined in Section 8.8.1.  Agents with open session that have
   access to the policy rules to be terminated are notified via the ARE
   notification.

   The middlebox will reject all requests for new policy enable rules
   that conflict with the just established PDR as long as the PDR is not
   terminated.  In such a case, a negative 'conflict with existing rule'
   (0x0350) reply will be generated.

   After checking the address tuple attributes, the middlebox chooses a
   lifetime value for the new policy rule to be created, which is
   greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to the minimum
   of the requested value and the maximum lifetime specified by the
   middlebox capabilities attribute at session setup.  Formally, the
   lifetime is chosen such that

         0 <= lt_granted <= MINIMUM(lt_requested, lt_maximum)

   holds, where 'lt_granted' is the actual lifetime chosen by the
   middlebox, 'lt_requested' is the lifetime requested by the agent, and
   'lt_maximum' is the maximum lifetime specified during capability
   exchange at session setup.

   If there are further sessions in state OPEN with authenticated agents
   authorized to access the policy rule, then to each of these agents a
   corresponding ARE notification with lifetime set to lt_granted is
   sent.

   If the chosen lifetime is zero, the middlebox sends a negative reply
   of type 'middlebox configuration failed' (0x034A) to the agent.


8.8.3.  Processing on Pure Firewalls

   If the middlebox is acting as a pure firewall, then it tries to
   configure the requested disable rule, i.e., configuring a blocking
   rule at the firewall.  The disable rule is configured such that
   communication between the specified internal and external address
   tuples is blocked with covering the specified wildcarding.  If the
   configuration  fails, for example because the blocking rule would
   conflict with high-level firewall policies, then the middlebox
   returns a negative reply message of type 'middlebox configuration

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   failed' (0x034A).

   If the configuration was successful, the middlebox establishes a new
   policy disable rule and assigns to it a policy rule identifier in
   state ENABLED.  It generates a positive PDR reply and sets the
   attributes as specified below.

   The identifier chosen for the new policy rule is reported in the
   policy rule identifier attribute of the PDR reply.

   The chosen lifetime is reported in the lifetime attribute of the PDR
   reply.


8.8.4.  Processing on Network Address Translators

   If the middlebox is configured as a NAT, then it tries to block the
   specified address tuple in the NAT.  The mechanisms used for this
   depend on the implementation and capabilities of the NAT.

   Should in either NAT case the configuration fail, a negative reply
   'middlebox configuration failed' (0x034A) is returned.

   If the configuration was successful, the middlebox establishes a new
   policy disable rule and assigns to it a policy rule identifier in
   state ENABLED.  It generates a positive PDR reply and sets the
   attributes as specified below.

   The identifier chosen for the new policy rule is reported in the
   policy rule identifier attribute of the PDR reply.

   The chosen lifetime is reported in the lifetime attribute of the PDR
   reply.


8.8.5.  Processing on combined Firewalls and NATs

   Middleboxes that are combinations of firewall and NAT are configured
   in such a way that the firewall is first configured with the blocking
   rule and afterwards the NAT is configured to block the address tuple.
   This aspect of middlebox operation may be irrelevant to SIMCO, since
   some NATs already do firewall configuration on their own.


8.9.  Generating ARE Notifications

   At any time, the middlebox may terminate a policy rule by deleting
   the configuration of the rule and by changing the corresponding PID
   state from ENABLED or from RESERVED, respectively, to UNUSED.



Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 59]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   For each session in state OPEN with authenticated agents authorized
   to access the policy rule, the middlebox generates a corresponding
   ARE notification with lifetime attribute set to zero and sends it to
   the respective agent.  The identifier of the terminated policy rule
   is reported in the policy rule identifier attribute of the ARE
   notification.

   After sending the notification, the middlebox will consider the
   policy rule to be non-existent.  It will not process any further
   transaction on this policy rule.

   The middlebox generates in the case of PRR, PER, PEA, and PLC
   (reserving and enabling policy rules, and changes of the lifetime)
   for each session in state OPEN with authenticated agents authorized
   to access the policy rule other then the requesting agent an ARE
   notification after processing the request.  Through this ARE
   notification all other agents are kept synchronized with the latest
   state of the policy rules.


9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Possible Threats to SIMCO

   Middleboxes, such as firewalls and NATs, are usually operated for
   improving the network security and for extending the IP address space
   (note that stand-alone NATs are not considered to improve security,
   see [RFC2663]).  The configuration of middleboxes from an external
   entity looks quite counterproductive on the first glimpse, since an
   attacker using this can possibly configure the middlebox in such way
   that no filtering is applied anymore or that NAT bindings are
   configured for malicious use.  So the middlebox is not performing the
   intended function anymore.  Possible threats to SIMCO are:

      - Man in the middle
        A malicious host intercepts messages exchanged between SIMCO
        agent and middlebox and can change the content of the messages
        on the fly.  This man in the middle attack would result in, from
        the agent's view, in a proper middlebox configuration, but the
        middlebox would be configured not accordingly.  The man in the
        middlebox could open pin holes that compromise the protected
        network's security.

      - Changing content
        The message content could be changed in such a way, that not the
        requested policy rule configuration is configured in the
        middlebox, but any other unwanted configuration.  That way, an
        attacker can open the firewall for his own traffic.




Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 60]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


      - Replaying
        Already sent messages could be re-sent in order to configure the
        middlebox in such way that hosts could configure policy rules
        without the permission of a application level gateway or system
        administrator.

      - Wiretapping
        An already configured policy rule could be re-used by other
        hosts, if the policy rule is configure with a too broad
        wildcarding (see below).  These hosts could send unwanted
        traffic.



9.2.  Securing SIMCO with IPsec

   The security considerations section identified several issues on
   security for SIMCO.  SIMCO can rely on IPsec mechanisms, as defined
   in [RFC2402] and [RFC2406], for ensuring proper operations.

   When SIMCO relies on IPsec, it uses IPsec in transport mode with
   authentication header (AH) [RFC2402] and encapsulating security
   payload (ESP) [RFC2406], so that IP traffic between SIMCO agent and
   middlebox is protected.  The authentication header is used for
   protecting the whole packet against content changes and replaying.
   The ESP header is used to prevent from wiretapping.

   At either side, agent or middlebox, the IP addresses of agent or
   middlebox, TCP as transport protocol and if possible the port numbers
   should be pre-configured.  Only packets from the preconfigured
   address of the agents or middlebox should be accepted.

   The keys for authentication both SIMCO agent and middlebox are pre-
   configured at each side.  For replay protection, the use of a key
   management system is recommended. For the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
   protocol see [RFC2409].



10.  IAB Considerations on UNSAF

   UNilateral Self-Address Fixing (UNSAF) is described in [RFC3424] as a
   process at originating endpoints that attempt to determine or fix the
   address (and port) by which they are known to another endpoint.
   UNSAF proposals, such as STUN [RFC3489] are considered as a general
   class of workarounds for NAT traversal and as solutions for scenarios
   with no middlebox communication (MIDCOM).

   This document describes a protocol implementation of the MIDCOM
   semantics and thus is implementing a middlebox communication (MIDCOM)


Stiemerling, Quittek, Cadar                                    [Page 61]

Internet Draft         SIMCO Protocol Version 3.0          December 2005


   solution.  MIDCOM is not intended as a short-term workaround, but
   more as a long-term solution for middlebox communication.  In MIDCOM,
   endpoints are not involved in allocating, maintaining, and deleting
   addresses and ports at the middlebox.  The full control of addresses
   and ports at the middlebox is located at the SIMCO server.

   Therefore, this document addresses the UNSAF considerations in
   [RFC3424] by proposing a long-term alternative solution.
