1. Abstract

 This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
 for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
 In particular, it describes objects used for managing ATM Adaptation 
 Layer-2 based interfaces, devices, networks and services.

 This memo is an extension to RFC 1215 [25].

3. Overview

 ATM AAL2 management objects are used to manage ATM interfaces,
 ATM virtual links,  ATM cross-connects, AAL2 entities and AAL2
 Connections supported by ATM hosts, ATM switches and ATM networks.
 This section provides an overview and background of how to use this
 MIB.

 The purpose of this memo is primarily to manage ATM AAL2 VCs.
 
3.1 Background

 In addition to the MIB module defined in this memo, other MIB modules 
 are necessary to manage ATM interfaces, links and cross-connects. 
 Examples include MIB II for general system and interface management
 (RFC 1213 [3] and RFC 2863 [4]), the DS3 or SONET MIBs for management 
 of SONET and DS3 physical interfaces, and, as appropriate, MIB modules 
 for applications that make use of ATM, such as SMDS [28] and LAN 
 Emulation [27].  These MIB modules are outside the scope of this 
 specification.

 This MIB module also requires the use of the ATM-MIB module defined
 in [24] and ATM-specific textual conventions defined in [34].

 The current specification of this supplemental ATM2-MIB is based on 
 SNMPv2-SMI.

3.2 Structure of the MIB

 The managed ATM AAL2 objects are arranged into the following tables:
 1. ATM AAL2 interface configuration table
 2. AAL2 connection performance statistics table
 3. AAL2 Channel Identifier (CID) Performance Statistics Table

3.2.1  Support of ATM AAL2 by ifTable

 The AAL2 entity in an ATM device (e.g., switch or host) is managed
 using the ifTable.  There are additional counters specified for AAL2
 than those specified in the ATM B-ICI document [21].  Specific
 interpretations of ifTable for the AAL2 CPCS layer are as follows.

   Object   Use for AAL2 CPCS layer entity
   ======   ==============================

   ifIndex  Each AAL2 entity is represented by an ifEntry.

   ifDescr  Description of the AAL2 entity.

   ifType   The value that is allocated for AAL2 is 187.

   ifMtu    Set to the largest PDU size for the
            AAL2 CPCS layer that can be processed
            by the AAL2 entity.

   ifSpeed  	      Set to 0.

   ifPhysAddress   An octet string of zero length.

   ifAdminStatus   See [17].

   ifOperStatus    Assumes the value down(2) if the AAL2
                   layer is down.

   ifLastChange    See [17].

   ifInOctets      The number of received AAL2 CPCS PDU octets.

   ifOutOctets     The number of AAL2 CPCS PDU octets
                   transmitted.

   ifInUcastPkts   The number of received AAL2 CPCS PDUs passed
                   to a higher-layer.

   ifOutUcastPkts  The number of AAL2 CPCS PDUs received from a
                   higher-layer for transmission.
                   [Note:  The number of AAL2 PDUs actually
                   transmitted is the number received from a
                   higher-layer for transmission minus any which
                   are counted by ifOutErrors and ifOutDiscards.]

   ifInErrors      Number of errored AAL2 CPCS PDUs received.
                   The types of errors counted include  CRC-32 errors,
                   SAR time-out errors, and oversized SDU errors.

   IfInUnknownProtos Set to 0.

   ifInDiscards      Number of received AAL2 CPCS PDUs discarded.
                     Possible reason may be input buffer overflow.

   ifOutErrors       Number of AAL2 CPCS PDUs that could not be
                     transmitted due to errors.

   ifOutDiscards     Number of AAL2 CPCS PDUs received for
                     transmission that are discarded. Possible
                     reason may be output buffer overflow.

   ifInMulticastPkts  Set to 0.

   ifInBroadcastPkts  Set to 0.

   ifOutMulticastPkts Set to 0.

   ifOutBroadcastPkts Set to 0.

   ifName             Textual name (unique on this system) of the
                      AAL2 entity or an octet string of zero length.

   ifHighSpeed        Set to 0.

   ifConnectorPresent Set to false (2).

   ifPromiscuousMode  Set to false(2).

   ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable     Default is disabled (2).

   ifAlias    The non-volatile 'alias' name for the interface
              as specified by a network manager.


3.2.2  AAL2 Connection Performance Statistics Table

 An AAL2 connection table is used to provide AAL2 performance
 information for each AAL2 virtual connection that is terminated
 at the AAL2 entity contained within an ATM switch or host.

3.2.3 AAL2 Channel Identifier (CID) Performance Statistics Table

 An AAL2 Channel Identifier(CID) performance statistics table is
 used to provide Channel Identifier performance information for
 AAL2 CID.

6. Security Considerations

 The managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information since,
 collectively, they allow tracing and influencing of virtual connections 
 in ATM switches or networks and provide information of their traffic 
 characteristics.

 It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
 possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them 
 over the network via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide features 
 for such a secure environment.

 SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network itself 
 is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control 
 as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
 (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

 It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features 
 as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use of the 
 User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based Access Control 
 Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

 It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity 
 giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give 
 access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
 rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
