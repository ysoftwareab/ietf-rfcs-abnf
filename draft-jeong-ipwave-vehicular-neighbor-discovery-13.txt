           draft-jeong-ipwave-vehicular-neighbor-discovery-13

Abstract

   This document specifies a Vehicular Neighbor Discovery (VND) as an
   extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP-based vehicular
   networks.  An optimized Address Registration and a multihop Duplicate
   Address Detection (DAD) mechanism are performed for having operation
   efficiency and also saving both wireless bandwidth and vehicle
   energy.  In addition, three new ND options for prefix discovery,
   service discovery, and mobility information report are defined to
   announce the network prefixes and services inside a vehicle (i.e., a
   vehicle's internal network).

Internet-Draft        Vehicular Neighbor Discovery         February 2022


1.  Introduction

   Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) have been researched for
   Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) such as driving safety,
   efficient driving and entertainment.  Considering the high-speed
   mobility of vehicular network based on Dedicated Short-Range
   Communications (DSRC) [DSRC-WAVE], IEEE has standardized IEEE 802.11p
   [IEEE-802.11p] as a MAC protocol for vehicles in Wireless Access in
   Vehicular Environments (WAVE).  IEEE 802.11p was renamed IEEE 802.11
   Outside the Context of a Basic Service Set (OCB) [IEEE-802.11-OCB].
   In addition, IEEE has also standardized a family standard suite of
   WAVE as IEEE 1609.  This IEEE 1609 standard suite is considered as a
   key component for ITS.  IEEE 1609 standards include IEEE 1609.0
   [WAVE-1609.0], 1609.2 [WAVE-1609.2], 1609.3 [WAVE-1609.3], and 1609.4
   [WAVE-1609.4], which provide a low-latency and alternative network
   for vehicular communications.  What is more, IP-based vehicular
   networks specialized as IP Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments
   (IPWAVE) [I-D.ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking] can enable many use
   cases over vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I),
   and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications.  IETF has
   standardized an IPv6 packet delivery protocol over IEEE 802.11-OCB
   [RFC8691].

   VANET features high mobility dynamics, asymmetric and lossy
   connections, and moderate power constraint (e.g., electric cars and
   unmanned aerial vehicles).  Links among hosts and routers in VANET
   can be considered as undetermined connectivities with constantly
   changing neighbors described in [RFC5889].  IPv6 [RFC8200] is
   selected as the network-layer protocol for Internet applications by
   IEEE 1609.0 and 1609.3.  However, the relative long-time Neighbor
   Discovery (ND) process in IPv6 [RFC4861] is not suitable in VANET
   scenarios.

   To better support the interaction between vehicles or between
   vehicles and Rode-Side Units (RSUs), this document specifies a
   Vehicular Neighbor Discovery (VND) procedure as an extension of IPv6
   ND for IP-based vehicular networks.  VND provides vehicles with an
   optimized Address Registration and a multihop Duplicate Address
   Detection (DAD) mechanism.  In addition, an efficient mobility
   management scheme is specified to support efficient V2V, V2I, and V2X
   communications.  Detailed statements of the mobility management are
   addressed in [I-D.jeong-ipwave-vehicular-mobility-management] .

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in [RFC4861], [RFC4862],
   [RFC6775], and [RFC8691].  In addition, the following new terms are
   defined as below:

   *  WAVE: Acronym for "Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments"
      [WAVE-1609.0].

   *  Mobility Anchor (MA): A node that maintains IP addresses and
      mobility information of vehicles in a road network to support the
      address autoconfiguration and mobility management of them.  It has
      end-to-end connections with RSUs under its control.  It maintains
      a DAD Table recording the IP addresses of vehicles moving within
      the communication coverage of its RSUs.

   *  Vehicular Cloud: A cloud infrastructure for vehicular networks,
      including compute nodes, storage nodes, and network nodes.

   *  Traffic Control Center (TCC): A node that maintains road
      infrastructure information (e.g., RSUs, traffic signals, and loop
      detectors), vehicular traffic statistics (e.g., average vehicle
      speed and vehicle inter-arrival time per road segment), and
      vehicle information (e.g., a vehicle's identifier, position,
      direction, speed, and trajectory as a navigation path).  TCC is
      included in a vehicular cloud for vehicular networks and has MAs
      under its management.

4.  Overview

   This document proposes an optimized ND with a more adaptive structure
   for vehicular networks compared to [RFC4861] by considering dynamic
   vehicle mobility and overhead of control message traffic in wireless
   environments.  Furthermore, prefix and service discovery can be
   implemented as part of the ND's process along with an efficient
   Address Registration procedure and a DAD mechanism for moving
   vehicles.  This document specifies a set of behaviors between
   vehicles and RSUs to accomplish these goals.

4.1.  Link Model

   There is a relationship between a link and a network prefix along
   with reachability scopes, such as link-local and global scopes.  The
   legacy IPv6 ND protocol [RFC4861] has the following link model.  All
   IPv6 nodes in the same on-link subnet, which use the same subnet
   prefix with the on-link bit set, are reachable with each other by
   one-hop links.  The symmetry of the connectivity among the nodes is
   assumed, that is, bidirectional connectivity between two on-link

   nodes.  However, a link model in vehicular networks (called vehicular
   link model) should consider the asymmetry of the connectivity that
   unidirectional links can exist due to interference in wireless
   channels and the different levels of transmission power employed by
   wireless network interfaces.

   The on-link subnet can be constructed by one link (as a basic service
   set) or multiple links (as an extended service set) called a multi-
   link subnet [RFC6775].  In this multi-link subnet, an all-node-
   multicasted packet is copied and related to other links by an ND
   proxy.  On the other hand, in vehicular networks having fast moving
   vehicles, multiple links can share the same subnet prefix for
   operation efficiency.  For example, if two wireless links under two
   adjacent RSUs are in the same subnet, a vehicle as an IPv6 host does
   not need to reconfigure its IPv6 address during handover between
   those RSUs.  However, the packet relay by an RSU as an ND proxy is
   not required because such a relay can cause a broadcast storm in the
   extended subnet.  Thus, in the multi-link subnet, all-node-
   multicasting needs to be well-calibrated to either being confined to
   multicasting in the current link or being disseminated to other links
   in the same subnet.

   In a connected multihop VANET, for efficient communication, vehicles
   in the same link of an RSU can communicate directly with each other,
   not through the serving RSU.  This direct wireless communication is
   similar to the direct wired communication in an on-link subnet using
   Ethernet as a wired network.  The vehicular link model needs to
   accommodate both the ad-hoc communication between vehicles and
   infrastructure communication between a vehicle and an RSU in an
   efficient and flexible way.  Therefore, the IPv6 ND should be
   extended to accommodate the concept of a new IPv6 link model in
   vehicular networks.

   To support multi-link subnet, this specification employs the Shared-
   Prefix model for prefix assignments.  A Shared-Prefix model refers to
   an addressing model where the prefix(es) are shared by more than one
   node.  In this document, we assume that in a specified subnet, all
   interfaces of RSUs responding for prefix assignments to vehicles hold
   the same prefix, which ensure vehicles obtain and maintain the same
   prefix in this subnet scope.

4.2.  ND Optimization

   This document takes advantage of the optimized ND for Low-Power
   Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) [RFC6775] because vehicular
   environments have common parts with 6LoWPAN, such as the reduction of
   unnecessary wireless traffic by multicasting and the energy saving in
   battery.  Note that vehicles tend to be electric vehicles whose
   energy source is from their battery.

   In the optimized IPv6 ND for 6LoWPAN, the connections among nodes are
   assumed to be asymmetric and unidirectional because of changing radio
   environment and loss signal.  The authors proposed an optimized IPv6
   ND which greatly eliminates link-scope multicast to save energy by
   constructing new options and a new scheme for address configurations.
   Similarly, this document proposes an improved IPv6 ND by eliminating
   many link-scope-multicast-based ND operations, such as DAD for IPv6
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862].  Thus, this
   document suggests an extension of IPv6 ND as vehicular ND tailored
   for vehicular networks along with new ND options (e.g., prefix
   discovery, service discovery, and mobility information options).

4.3.  Design Goals

   The vehicular ND in this document has the following design goals:

   *  To perform prefix and service discovery through ND procedure;

   *  To implement host-initiated refresh of Router Advertisement (RA)
      and remove the necessity for routers to use periodic or
      unsolicited multicast RA to find hosts;

   *  To replace Neighbor Unreachable Detection(NUD) and create Neighbor
      Cache Entries (NCE) for all registered vehicles in RSUs and MA by
      appending Address Registration Option (ARO) in Neighbor
      Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages;

   *  To support a multihop DAD by conveying ND messages received from
      vehicles to MA to eliminate multicast storms and save energy; and

   *  To support multihop communication for vehicles outside the
      coverage of RSUs to communicate with the serving RSU via a relay
      neighbor.

5.  Vehicular Network Architecture

   A vehicular network architecture for V2I and V2V is illustrated in
   Figure 1.  Three RSUs are deployed along roadsides and are connected
   to an MA through wired links.  There are two subnets such as Subnet1
   and Subnet2.  The wireless links of RSU1 and RSU2 belong to the same
   subnet named Subnet1, but the wireless link of RSU3 belongs to
   another subnet named Subnet2.  Vehicle2 is wirelessly connected to
   RSU1 while Vehicle3 and Vehicle4 are connected to RSU2 and RSU3,
   respectively.  Vehicles can directly communicate with each other
   through V2V connection (e.g., Vehicle1 and Vehicle2) to share driving
   information.  In addition, vehicles not in the range of any RSU may
   connect with RSU in multihop connection via relay vehicle (e.g.,
   Vehicle1 can contact RSU1 via Vehicle2).  Vehicles are assumed to
   start the connection to an RSU when they entered the coverage of the
   RSU.

   This document recommends a multi-link subnet involving multiple RSUs
   as shown in Figure 1.  This recommendation aims at the reduction of
   the frequency with which vehicles have to change their IP address
   during handover between two adjacent RSUs.  To construct this multi-
   link subnet, a Shared-Prefix model is proposed.  That is, for RSUs in
   the same subnet, the interfaces responsible for prefix assignment for
   vehicles should hold the same prefix in their global address.  This
   also promises vehicles achieve the same prefix in this scope.  When
   they pass through RSUs in the same subnet, vehicles do not need to
   perform the Address Registration and DAD again because they can use
   their current IP address in the wireless coverage of the next RSU.
   Moreover, this proposal accords with the assumption that nodes
   belonging to the same IP prefix domain are able to communicate with
   each other directly without the intervention of RSUs if they are
   within the wireless communication range of each other.  On the other
   hand, if vehicles enter the wireless coverage of an RSU belonging to
   another subnet with a different prefix, they repeat the Address
   Registration and DAD procedure to update their IP address with the
   new prefix.

   In Figure 1, RSU1 and RSU2 are deployed in a multi-link subnet with
   the same prefix address in their interfaces responding for connection
   with vehicles.  When vehicle2 leaves the coverage of RSU1 and enters
   RSU2, it maintains its address configuration and ignores Address
   Registration and DAD steps.  If vehicle2 moves into the coverage of
   RSU3, since RSU3 belongs to another subnet and holds a different
   prefix from RSU1 and RSU2, so vehicle2 must do Address Registration
   and DAD just as connecting to a new RSU.  Note that vehicles and RSUs
   have their internal networks including in-vehicle devices and
   servers, respectively.  The structures of the internal networks are
   described in [I-D.ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking].

6.  ND Extension for Prefix and Service Discovery

   This section specifies an IPv6 ND extension for vehicle-to-vehicle
   (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networking.  This section
   also defines three new ND options for prefix discovery, service
   discovery, and mobility information report: (i) Vehicular Prefix
   Information (VPI) option, (ii) Vehicular Service Information (VSI)
   option, and (iii) Vehicular Mobility Information (VMI) option.  It
   also describes the procedure of the ND protocol with those options.

6.1.  Vehicular Prefix Information Option

   The VPI option contains IPv6 prefix information in the internal
   network.  Figure 2 shows the format of the VPI option.

6.4.  Vehicular Neighbor Discovery

   Prefix discovery enables hosts (e.g., vehicles and in-vehicle
   devices) to distinguish destinations on the same link from those only
   reachable via RSUs.  A vehicle (or its in-vehicle devices) can
   directly communicate with on-link vehicles (or their in-vehicle
   devices) without the relay of an RSU, but through V2V communications
   along with VPI ND option.  This VPI option contains IPv6 prefixes in
   a vehicle's internal network.

   Vehicles announce services in their internal networks to other
   vehicles through an VSI ND option.  The VSI option contains a list of
   vehicular services in a vehicle's or an RSU's internal network.

Internet-Draft        Vehicular Neighbor Discovery         February 2022


   A vehicle periodically announces an NS message containing VPI and VSI
   options with its prefixes and services in all-nodes multicast address
   to reach all neighboring nodes.  When it receives this NS message,
   another neighboring node responds to this NS message by sending an NA
   message containing the VPI and VSI options with its prefixes and
   services via unicast towards the NS-originating node.

   Therefore, prefix and service discovery can be achieved via ND
   messages (e.g., NS and NA) by vehicular ND with VPI and VSI options.
   This VND-based discovery eliminates an additional prefix and service
   discovery scheme, such as DNS-based Service Discovery [RFC6763]
   (e.g., Multicast DNS (mDNS) [RFC6762] and DNSNA
   [I-D.jeong-ipwave-iot-dns-autoconf]), other than ND.  That is,
   vehicles and RSUs can rapidly discover the network prefixes and
   services of the other party without any additional service discovery
   protocol.

6.5.  Message Exchange Procedure for V2I Networking

   This subsection explains a message exchange procedure for VND in V2I
   networking, where a vehicle communicates with its corresponding node
   in the Internet via an RSU.

   Figure 5 shows an example of message exchange procedure in V2I
   networking.  Detailed steps of the procedure are explained in
   Section 7.  The mobility management part is described in
   [I-D.jeong-ipwave-vehicular-mobility-management].

   Note that a vehicle could also perform the prefix and service
   discovery simultaneously along with Address Registration procedure,
   as shown in Figure 7.

   This document specified that RSUs as routers do not transmit
   periodical and unsolicited multicast RA messages including a prefix
   for energy saving in vehicular networks.  Vehicles as hosts
   periodically initiate an RS message according to a time interval
   (considering its position and an RSU's coverage).  Since they have a
   digital road map with the information of RSUs (e.g., position and
   communication coverage), vehicles can know when they will go out of
   the communication range of an RSU along with the signal strength
   (e.g., Received Channel Power Indicator (RCPI) [VIP-WAVE]) from the
   RSU.  RSUs replies with a solicited RA in unicast only when they
   receive an RS message.

7.  Address Registration and Duplicate Address Detection

   This section explains address configuration, consisting of IP Address
   Autoconfiguration, Address Registration, and multihop DAD via V2I or
   V2V.

   This document recommends a new Address Registration and DAD scheme in
   order to avoid multicast flooding and decrease link-scope multicast
   for energy and wireless channel conservation on a large-scale
   vehicular network.  Host-initiated refresh of RA removes the
   necessity for routers to use frequent and unsolicited multicast RAs
   to accommodate hosts.  This also enables the same IPv6 address
   prefix(es) to be used across a subnet.

   There are three scenarios feasible in Address Registration scheme:

Internet-Draft        Vehicular Neighbor Discovery         February 2022


   1.  Vehicle enters the subnet for the first time or the current RSU
       belongs to another subnet: Vehicles need to perform the Address
       Registration and multihop DAD as described in the following
       subsections.

   2.  Vehicle has already configured its IP addresses with prefix
       obtained from the previous RSU, and the current RSU located in
       the same subnet: This means RSUs have the same prefix and the
       vehicle has no need to repeat the Address Registration and
       multihop DAD.

   3.  Vehicle is not in the coverage of RSU but has a neighbor
       registered in RSU: This document proposes a new V2V scenario for
       vehicles which are currently not in the range of the RSU.  If a
       user vehicle failed to find an on-link RSU, it starts to look for
       adjacent vehicle neighbors which can work as a relay neighbor to
       share the prefix obtained from RSU and undertake DAD of the user
       vehicle by forwarding DAD messages to RSU.

7.1.  Address Autoconfiguration

   A vehicle as an IPv6 host creates its link-local IPv6 address and
   global IPv6 address as follows [RFC4862].  When they receive RS
   messages from vehicles, RSUs send back RA messages containing prefix
   information.  The vehicle makes its global IPv6 addresses by
   combining the prefix for its current link and its link-layer address.

   The address autoconfiguration does not perform the legacy DAD as
   defined in [RFC4862].  Instead, a new multihop DAD is performed in
   Section 7.3.

7.2.  Address Registration

   After its IP tentative address autoconfiguration with the known
   prefix from an RSU and its link-layer address, a vehicle starts to
   register its IP address to the serving RSU along with multihop DAD.
   Address Register Option (ARO) is used in this step and its format is
   defined in [RFC6775].

   ARO is always host-initiated by vehicles.  Information such as
   registration time and registration status contained in ARO are
   applied to indicate the registration duration and result.  ARO will
   also be forwarded to MA together with NS by RSUs.

   An example message exchange procedure of Address Registration is
   presented in Figure 6.  Since Address Registration is performed
   simultaneously with the multihop DAD, the specific procedure is
   together described with the DAD mechanism in Section 7.3.

7.3.  Multihop Duplicate Address Detection

   Before it can exchange data, a node should determine whether its IP
   address is already used by another node or not.  In the legacy IPv6
   ND, hosts multicast NS messages to all nodes in the same on-link
   subnet for DAD.  Instead of this, an optimized multihop DAD is
   designed to eliminate multicast messages for energy-saving purpose.
   For this multihop DAD, Neighbor Cache and DAD Table are maintained by
   each RSU and an MA, respectively, for the duplicate address
   inspection during the multihop DAD process.  That is, each RSU makes
   Neighbor Cache Entries (NCE) of all the on-link hosts in its Neighbor
   Cache.  Similarly, the MA stores all the NCEs reported by the RSUs in
   its DAD Table.

   With the multihop DAD, a vehicle can skip the multicast-based DAD in
   its current wireless link whenever it enters the coverage of another
   RSU in the same subset, leading to the reduction of traffic overhead
   in vehicular wireless links.

   For the multihop DAD, we take advantage of the procedure of [RFC6775]
   but simplified the message flows by canceling the two new ICMPv6
   message types such as Duplicate Address Request (DAR) and the
   Duplicate Address Confirmation (DAC).  Instead, NS and NA containing
   ARO are directly forwarded between RSU and MA.  This idea is raised
   because DAR and DAC

    Figure 7: Neighbor Discovery Address Registration with Multihop DAD

   1.  A vehicle sends an NS message to the current RSU in unicast,
       containing the ARO to register its address.

   2.  The RSU receives the NS message, and then inspects its Neighbor
       Cache to check whether it is duplicate or not.  If there is no
       duplicate NCE, a tentative NCE is created for this address, and
       then the RSU forward the NS message containing the ARO to the MA
       for the multihop DAD.

   3.  When the MA receives NS from an RSU, it checks whether the
       register-requested address exists in its DAD Table or not.  If an
       entry with the same address exists in the DAD Table, which means
       that the address is considered "Duplicate Address", then MA
       returns a NA message containing the registration status in ARO to
       notify the RSU of the address duplication.  If no entry with the
       same address exists in the DAD Table, which means that an entry
       for the address is created, then MA replies a NA message to the
       RSU to confirm the uniqueness of the register-requested address
       to the RSU.

   4.  If the address duplication is notified by the MA, the RSU deletes
       the tentative NCE, and forward NA with to the address-
       registration vehicle to notify the registration failure.
       Otherwise, the RSU changes the tentative NCE into a registered
       NCE in its Neighbor Cache, and then forward NA to the vehicle to
       notify the registration success.

   Thus, the multihop DAD is processed simultaneously with the Address
   Registration.  Note that the tentative address is not considered
   assigned to the vehicle until the MA confirms the uniqueness of the
   register-requested address in the multihop DAD.

7.3.2.  DAD with one Intermediate Vehicle

   If a vehicle failed to register a default router, it triggers
   neighbor discovery to look for vehicle neighbors which can provide
   relay service using multihop communication.  In this specification,
   we assumed vehicles would not emulate V2V communication and trigger
   relay scenario only if Router Discovery(RD) failed.

     Figure 8: Address Registration and Multihop DAD via V2V Relay

   Since vehicles have a digital road map with the information of RSUs
   (e.g., position and communication coverage), they can determine if
   they are available to serve as a relay vehicle.  Only vehicles with
   the ability to serve as temporary relays will take action when they
   receive relay service requests.  The user vehicle can process global
   address configuration, Address Registration and DAD through its relay
   vehicle before it enters the coverage of RSUs.  See Figure 8.

Internet-Draft        Vehicular Neighbor Discovery         February 2022


   When a user vehicle failed to directly register to an RSU, it
   initiates neighbor discovery to detect vehicle neighbors through V2V
   communication.  Vehicle sends NS messages to connect with neighbors
   in range.  If neighbor can provide relay service, it creates a NCE
   for user vehicle, setting its own address as relay address, and sends
   back NA with prefix information received from RSU.

   To guarantee vehicles could find the nearest neighbor from multiple
   neighbors which can act as relay vehicles, a new time-out mechanism
   is presented to select the nearest neighbor by hop distance parameter
   carried in Prefix Information Option.  That is, a user vehicle
   multicast NS messages to look for relay vehicles after RD failed and
   wait for 1.5 seconds to receive all NA replies from neighbors.  Each
   NA carries its own global prefix(es) and the hop distance(s) in
   Prefix Information Option.  The user vehicle preserves every NA reply
   in a temporary router list and select the one with least hop counts
   as its relay vehicle after time out.

   With receipt of NA, user vehicle configures its global address with
   prefix information as mentioned in Section 7.1.  After this, user
   vehicle takes up to initiate the Address Registration along with DAD
   process via relay vehicle.  NS message is configured as specified in
   Section 7.2 but indicate the relay vehicle's address as next-hop to
   reach the RSU.  In such a case, when relay vehicle receives relay
   request message, it will forward NS message to RSU.  The procedure
   sets up on the rails except MA will include the relay vehicle's
   address as relay address in NCE to indicate that at this moment, it
   is not a directly attached vehicle, and sets the relay address as
   next-hop address.  Relay vehicle forwards DAD result information
   message to user vehicle as soon as it received.

7.3.3.  DAD with multiple Intermediate Vehicles

   This document supports multihop communications (e.g., multihop DAD
   and UDP/TCP transmission) for remote vehicles through multiple relay
   vehicles.  Vehicles which have already finished DAD process can serve
   as temporary routers and forward packets for remote vehicles.

   A new routing mechanism is specified to accomplish route selections
   among user vehicles and serving RSUs when multiple vehicles act as
   relay vehicles.  Taking advantage of the Destination-Sequenced
   Distance-Vector routing protocol (DSDV) [DSDV], this new routing
   approach supposes that each vehicle holds a Neighbor Routing
   Table which integrates the neighbor information in Neighbor Cache and
   forwarding records for remote vehicles.  Each vehicle which acts as a
   relay vehicle for this remote vehicle will make records in its
   Neighbor Routing Table.

   Figure 9 specifies an example of parameters in Neighbor Routing
   Table when more than one vehicle work as intermediate relay vehicles.
   In Figure 9, Vehicle3 connects RSU1 indirectly via Vehicle2 and
   Vehicle1.  When Vehicle1 and Vehicle2 forward messages for Vehicle3,
   they make records in its Neighbor Routing Table including the next-
   hop node to indicate the route to Vehicle3.  This can ensure that the
   packets from a source vehicle can be successfully transmitted to an
   RSU as well as the reverse packet path exists from the RSU to the
   source vehicle.

                    Vehicles act as Relay Vehicles

7.4.  Pseudonym Handling

   Considering the privacy protection of a vehicle, a pseudonym
   mechanism for its link-layer address is requested.  This mechanism
   periodically modifies the link-layer address, leading to the update
   of the corresponding IP address.  A random MAC Address Generation
   mechanism is proposed in Appendix F.4 of [IEEE-802.11-OCB] by
   generating the 46 remaining bits of MAC address using a random number
   generator.  When it changes its MAC address, a vehicle should ask the
   serving RSU to update its own NCE, and to register its IP address
   into the MA again.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document shares all the security issues of the neighbor
   discovery protocol and 6LoWPAN protocol.  This document can get
   benefits from secure neighbor discovery (SEND) [RFC3971] in order to
   protect ND from possible security attacks.
