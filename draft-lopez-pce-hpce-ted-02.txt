    Traffic Engineering Database dissemination for Hierarchical PCE
                               scenarios
                      draft-lopez-pce-hpce-ted-02

Abstract

   The PCE architecture is well-defined and may be used to compute the
   optimal path for LSPS across domains in MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks.
   The Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) [RFC6805] was
   developed to provide an optimal path when the sequence of domains is
   not known in advance.  The procedure and mechanism for populating the
   Traffic Engineering Database (TED) with domain topology and link
   information used in H-PCE-based path computations is open to
   interpretation.  This informational document describes how topology
   dissemination mechanisms may be used to provide TE information
   between Parent and Child PCEs (within the H-PCE context).  In
   particular, it describes how BGP-LS might be used to provide inter-
   domain connectivity.  This document is not intended to define new
   extensions, it demonstrates how existing procedures and mechanisms
   may be used.

1.  Introduction

   In scenarios with multiple domains in both MPLS-TE and GMPLS
   networks, the hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE)
   Architecture, defined in [RFC6805], allows to obtain the optimum end-
   to-end path.  The architecture exploits a hierarchical relation among
   domains.

   [RFC6805] defines the architecture and requirements for the end-to-
   end path computation across domains.  The solution draft for the
   H-PCE [I-D.draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy-extensions] is focused on the

Internet-Draft                  TED-HPCE                       July 2014


   PCEP protocol extensions to support such H-PCE procedures, including
   negotiation of capabilities and errors.  However, neither the
   architecture nor the solution draft specify which mechanism must to
   be used to build and populate the parent PCE (pPCE) Traffic
   Engineering Database (TED).

   The H-PCE architecture documents define the minimum content needed in
   the traffic engineering database required to compute paths.  The
   information required by parent TEDB are identified in [RFC6805] and
   further elaborated in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-pce-inter-area-as-applicability].  For instance,
   [RFC6805] and [I-D.draft-ietf-pce-inter-area-as-applicability]
   suggest that BGP-LS could be used as a "northbound" TE advertisement.
   This means that a PCE does not need to listen IGP in its domain, but
   its TED is populated by messages received (for example) from a Route
   Reflector.  [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-te-pm-bgp] extends BGP-LS to
   disseminate traffic engineering information.  The parameters
   considered are: delay, packet loss and bandwidth.

   This document highlights the applicability of BGP-LS to the
   dissemination of domain topology within the H-PCE architecture.  In
   particular, it describes how can BGP-LS be used to send the inter-
   domain connectivity.  It also shows how can OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE
   updates be mapped into BGP-LS.

   Note that this document is not intended to define new protocol
   extensions, it is an informational document and where required it
   highlights where existing mechanisms and protocols may be applied.

1.1.  Parent PCE Domain Topology

   The pPCE maintains a domain topology map of the child domains and
   their interconnectivity.  This map does not include any visibility
   into the child domains.  Where inter-domain connectivity is provided
   by TE links, the capabilities of those links may also be known to the
   pPCE.  The pPCE maintains a TED for the parent domain, the nodes in
   the parent domain are abstractions of the cPCE domains (connected by
   real or virtual TE links), but the pPCE domain may also include real
   nodes and links.

   The procedure and protocol mechanism for disseminating and
   construction of the pPCE TED may be provided using a number of
   mechanisms, including manually configuring the necessary information
   or automated using a separate instance of a routing protocol to
   advertise the domain interconnectivity.  Since inter-domain TE links
   can be advertised by the IGPs operating in the child domains, this
   information could then be exported to the parent PCE either by the
   child PCEs or using north-bound export mechanisms.

1.2.  Parent PCE TED requirements

   The information that would be exchanged includes:

   o  Identifier of advertising child PCE.

   o  Identifier of PCE's domain.

   o  Identifier of the link.

   o  TE properties of the link (metrics, bandwidth).

   o  Other properties of the link (technology-specific).

   o  Identifier of link endpoints.

   o  Identifier of adjacent domain.

2.  H-PCE Domain Topology Dissemination and Construction Methods

   A variety of methods exist to provide are different alternatives so
   the parent PCE can get the topological information from the child
   PCEs (cPCEs):

   o  Statically configure all inter-domain link and topology
      information.

   o  Membership of an IGP instance.  The necessary topological
      information could be disseminated by joining the IGP instance of
      each child PCE domain.  However, by doing so, it would break the
      domain confidentiality principles and is subject to scalability
      issues.

   o  PCEP Notification Messages.  Another solution is to send the
      interconnection information between domains using PCEP
      Notifications (see section 4.8.4 of [RFC6805]).  One approach,
      followed in research work, is embedding in PCEP Notifications the
      Inter-AS OSPF-TE Link State Advertisements (LSA) to send the
      Inter-Domain Link information from child PCEs to the parent PCE
      and to send reachability information (list of end-points in each
      domain).  However, it is argued that the utilization of PCEP to
      disseminate topology is beyond scope of the protocol.

   o  Separate IGP instance.  [RFC6805] points out that in models such
      as ASON it is possible to consider a separate instance of an IGP
      running within the parent domain where the participating protocol
      speakers are the nodes directly present in that domain and the
      PCEs (parent and child PCEs).

   o  Use north-bound distribution of TE information.  The North-Bound
      Distribution of Link-State and TE Information using BGP has been
      recently propose in the IEFT [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution].
      This approach is known as BGP-LS and defines a mechanism by which
      links state and traffic engineering information can be collected
      from networks and exported to external elements using the BGP
      routing protocol.  By using BGP-LS as northbound distribution
      mechanism, there would be a BGP speaker in each domains that sends
      the necessary information to a BGP speaker in the parent domain.
      This architecture is further elaborated in this document.

3.  H-PCE architecture using BGP-LS

   As mentioned in [I-D.draft-dugeon-pce-ted-reqs] PCE has to retrieve
   Traffic Engineering (TE) information to carry out its path
   computation.  This is required not only for intra-domain information,
   which can be got using IGP (like OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE), but also for
   inter-domain information in the Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE)
   architecture.

   Figure 1 shows an example of a H-PCE architecture.  In this example,
   there is a parent PCE and three child PCEs, and they are organized in
   multiple domains.  The parent PCE does not have information of the
   whole network, but is only aware of the connectivity among the
   domains and provides coordination to the child PCEs.  Figure 2 shows
   which is the visibility that parent PCE has from the network
   according to the definition in [RFC6805].

   Thanks to this topological information, when there is a request to a
   child PCE with the destination in another domain, this path request
   is sent to the parent PCE, which selects a set of candidate domain
   paths and sends requests to the child PCEs responsible for these
   domains.  Then, the parent PCE selects the best solution and it is
   transmitted to the source PCE.

                 Figure 2: Parent PCE topology information

   Thanks to the dissemination of inter-domain adjacency information
   from each cPCE to the pPCE, the pPCE can have a view of reachability
   between the domains.  The H-PCE architecture with BGP-LS is shown in

   Figure 3.  Each domain has a cPCE that is able to compute paths in
   the domain.  This child PCE has access to a domain TED, which is
   built using IGP information.  In each domain, a BGP speaker has
   access to such domain TED and acts as BGP-LS Route Reflector to
   provide network topology to the pPCE.  Next to the pPCE, there is a
   BGP speaker that maintains a BGP session with each of the BGP
   speakers in the domains to receive the topology and build the parent
   TED.  A policy can be applied to the BGP-LS speakers to decide which
   information is sent to its peer speaker.  The minimum amount of
   information that needs to be exchanged is the inter-domain
   connectivity, including the details of the Traffic Engineering Inter-
   domain Links [RFC6805].  With this information, the parent PCE is
   able to have access to a domain topology map and its connectivity.
   Additionally, the BGP-LS speaker can be configured to send some
   intra-domain information for virtual or candidate paths with some TE
   information.  In this case, the parent PCE has access to an extended
   database, with visibility of both intra-domain and inter-domain
   information and can compute the sequence of domains with better
   accuracy.

   BGP-LS [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution] extends the BGP Update
   messages to advertise link-state topology thanks to new BGP Network
   Layer Reachability Information (NLRI).  The Link State information is
   sent in two BGP attributes, the MP_REACH (defined in [RFC4670]) and a
   LINK_STATE attribute (defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution]).  To describe the inter domain
   links, in the MP_REACH attribute, a Link NLRI can be used with the
   local node descriptors the address of the source, and in the remote
   descriptors, the address of the destination of the link.  The Link
   Descriptors field has a TLV (Link Local/Remote Identifiers), which
   carries the prefix of the Unnumbered or Numbered Interface.  In case
   of the message informs about an intra-domain link, the standard
   traffic engineering information is included in the LINK_STATE
   attribute.

      Figure 3: Example of Hierarchical PCE architecture with BGP-LS

4.  Including inter-domain connectivity in BGP-LS

   In order for the parent PCE to carry out the path computation tasks
   it needs the inter-domain topology between the child domain
   scenarios.  This topology is learnt through IGP by each BGP-LS
   speaker.  The Traffic Engineering extensions (OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE)
   allow IGP to carry link state information that can be used in
   optimizing technics such as the PCE algorithms.  However, the parent
   PCE does not require such TE information, but just connectivity
   between the domains.  However, TE information within the domain could
   be disseminated to the parent PCE to reduce the queries to the child
   PCEs.

4.1.  Mapping from OSPF-TE

   Carrying TE information in OSPF is a well-known standardized feature
   [RFC3630].  This section explains how this information can be
   exported outside one IGP domain using BGP-LS.  BGP-LS extends the BGP
   Update messages to advertise link-state topology thanks to the new
   BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and BGP-LS
   attribute.

   The BGP NLRI carries the descriptors used to define the element in
   question (e.g. link or node) and the BGP-LS attribute carries the
   chosen parameters to characterize the described element.  Information
   is codified using multiple TLV triplets just as the ones used in
   OSPF-TE making it easy to integrate.  For the purpose of this
   document, we consider a scenario where there is an origin (router)
   with the correspondent IPv4, a destination with its IPv4 and a link
   having the following TE parameters: maximum BW, maximum reservable BW
   and unreserved BW.

4.1.1.  Node Descriptors

   In the OSPF packet, there are two fields that tell us the origin and
   destination node IDs.  The origin IP is the Source OSPF Router ID in
   the OSPF header and this is mapped into the IGP Router ID subTLV
   inside the Local Node Descriptors field
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution].  The destination IP is found as
   the Link ID field in the MPLS LSA in OSPF.  This is mapped into the
   correspondent IGP Router ID in the Remote Node Descriptors field
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution].

   There are other subTLVs inside the Local/Remote Node Descriptors but
   they are not relevant for this document.

4.1.2.  Link Descriptors

   The only two TLVs in the Link Descriptors field to map from OSPF are
   the local and remote interface addresses.  This information is mapped
   directly from the Local/Remote Interface address TLV carried in the
   MPLS LSA of OSPF into the Local/Remote Interface address subTLV of
   the Link Descriptors field.

   The same procedure must be applied for unnumbered interfaces but
   utilizing the Link Local/Remote Identifiers TLV.

4.1.3.  Mapping OSPF TE parameters into BGP-LS attribute

   As mentioned before, these parameters are not required in the H-PCE
   scenario.  They are just required to reduce the number of queries to
   the children PCEs.  The parent PCE can use bandwidth information
   between two domains to request for some possible connections instead
   of all.

   The BGP-LS attribute will be a set of TLV triplets carrying the
   desired TE parameters learnt by OSPF.  Bandwidth parameters are used
   to illustrate the example but they are many more (like, available
   labels).

   The BGP-LS attribute is mapped in the following way.  The TLVs
   carried in the MPLS-TE LSA in OSPF are directly translated into the
   equivalent TLVs in BGP-LS.  As such, the Unreserved BW TLV in OSPF is
   mapped into the Unreserved BW TLV in BGP-LS.  The same happens with
   the Maximum BW TLV and the Maximum Reservable BW TLV.
