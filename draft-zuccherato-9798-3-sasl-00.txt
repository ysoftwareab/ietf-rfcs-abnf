Abstract

   This document defines a SASL [RFC2222] authentication mechanism based
   on ISO/IEC 9798-3 [ISO3] and FIPS PUB 196 [FIPS] entity
   authentication.  This mechanism only provides authentication using
   X.509 certificates [X509].  It has no effect on the protocol
   encodings and does not provide integrity or confidentiality services.

1. Introduction

 1.1. Overview

   The key benefit of asymmetric (public key) security, is that the
   secret (private key) only needs to be placed with the entity that is
   being authenticated. Thus, a private key can be issued to a client,

   which can then be authenticated by ANY server based on a token
   generated by the client and the generally available public key.
   Symmetric authentication mechanisms (password mechanisms such as
   CRAM-MD5 [RFC2195]) require a shared secret, and the need to maintain
   it at both endpoints.  This means that a secret key for the client
   needs to be maintained at every server that may need to authenticate
   the client.

   The service described in this memo provides authentication only.
   There are a number of places where an authentication only service is
   useful, e.g., where confidentiality and integrity are provided by
   lower layers, or where confidentiality or integrity services are
   provided by the application.

 1.2. Relationship to TLS

   The functionality defined here can be provided by TLS, and it is
   important to consider why it is useful to have it in both places.
   There are several reasons for this, e.g.:

    - Simplicity.  This mechanism is simpler than TLS.  If there is
      only a requirement for this functionality (as distinct from all
      of TLS), this simplicity will facilitate deployment.

    - Layering.  The SASL mechanism to establish authentication works
      cleanly with most protocols.  This mechanism can fit more cleanly
      than TLS for some protocols.

2.  Description of Mechanism

 2.1. Scope

   The mechanism described in this memo provides either mutual or
   unilateral entity authentication as defined in ISO/IEC 9798-1 [ISO1]
   using an asymmetric (public-key) digital signature mechanism.

 2.2. Authentication modes

   This SASL mechanism contains two authentication modes:

    - Unilateral client authentication: The client digitally signs a
      challenge from the server, thus authenticating itself to the
      server.

    - Mutual authentication: The client digitally signs a challenge
      from the server and the server digitally signs a challenge from
      the client.  Thus both the client and server authenticate each
      other.

 2.3. SASL key

   This mechanism has two SASL keys corresponding to the two different
   modes:

    - "9798-U-<algorithm>" for unilateral client authentication.

    - "9798-M-<algorithm>" for mutual authentication.

   Each SASL key may be used with a list of algorithms. A list of
   supported algorithms is given in Section 4.

 2.4. Unilateral Client Authentication

   This section gives a brief description of the steps that are
   performed for unilateral client authentication.  The actual data
   structures are described fully in Section 3.

   a) The server generates a random challenge value R_B and sends it to
      the client.

   b) The client generates a random value R_A and creates a token
      TokenAB.  The token contains R_A and also a digital signature
      created by the client over both R_A and R_B.  Optionally, it also
      contains an identifier for the server and (RECOMMENDED) the
      client's certificate.

   c) The client sends the token to the server.

   d) The server verifies the token by:

      - verifying the client's signature in TokenAB (this includes
        full certificate path processing as described in [RFC2459]),
      - verifying that the random number R_B, sent to the client in
        Step 1, agrees with the random number contained in the signed
        data of TokenAB, and
      - verifying that the identifier for the server, if present,
        matches the server's distinguishing identifier.

 2.5. Mutual Authentication

   This section gives a brief description of the steps that are
   performed for mutual authentication. The actual data structures are
   described fully in Section 3.

   a) The server generates a random challenge value R_B and sends it to
      the client.

   b) The client generates a random value R_A and creates a token
      TokenAB. The token contains R_A and also a digital signature
      created by the client over both R_A and R_B. Optionally, it also
      contains an identifier for the server and (RECOMMENDED) the
      client's certificate.

   c) The client sends the token to the server.

   d) The server verifies the token by:

      - verifying the client's signature in TokenAB (this includes full
        certificate path processing as described in [RFC2459]),
      - verifying that the random number R_B, sent to the client in
        Step 1, agrees with the random number contained in the signed
        data of TokenAB, and
      - verifying that the identifier for the server, if present,
        matches the server's distinguishing identifier.

   e) The server creates a token TokenBA.  The token contains a
      digital signature created by the server over both R_A and R_B.
      Optionally, it also contains an identifier for the client, and a
      third random value R_C.

   f) The server sends the token to the client.

   g) The client verifies the token by:

      - verifying the server's signature in TokenBA (this includes
        full certificate path processing as described in [RFC2459]),
      - verifying that the random number R_B, received by the client in
        Step 1, agrees with the random number contained in the signed
        data of TokenBA,
      - verifying that the random number R_A, sent to the server in
        Step 2, agrees with the random number contained in the signed
        data of Token BA and
      - verifying that the identifier for the client, if present,
        matches the client's distinguishing identifier.

3.  Token and Message Definition

   Note - Protocol data units (PDUs) SHALL be DER-encoded [X690] before
          transmitted.

 3.1. The "TokenBA1" PDU

   TokenBA1 is used in both the unilateral client authentication and
   mutual authentication modes and is sent by the server to the client.




Zuccherato & Nystrom     Expires: November 2000                 [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT           9798-3 SASL Mechanism                  May 2000


   TokenBA1 contains a random value, and, optionally, the servers name
   and certificate information.

   TokenBA1 ::= SEQUENCE {
        randomB   RandomNumber,
        entityB   [0] GeneralNames OPTIONAL,
        certPref  [1] CertData OPTIONAL
   }

 3.2. The "TokenAB" PDU

   TokenAB is used in the unilateral client authentication and mutual
   authentication modes and is sent by the client to the server.
   TokenAB contains optional certification information, a random number,
   entity B's name (optionally) and a signature of a DER-encoded value
   of type TBSDataAB. The certA field SHOULD be used to send the
   client's X.509 certificate (or a URL to it) and a related certificate
   chain to the server.

   TokenAB ::= SEQUENCE {
        randomA   RandomNumber,
        entityB   [0] GeneralNames OPTIONAL,
        certA     [1] CertData OPTIONAL,
        signature SIGNATURE { TBSDataAB }
   }(CONSTRAINED BY {-- The entityB field shall be included in TokenAB
     -- if and only if it is also included in TBSDataAB. The entityB
     -- field SHOULD be present in TokenAB whenever the client
     -- believes it knows the identity of the server.--})

   TBSDataAB ::= SEQUENCE {
        randomA RandomNumber,
        randomB RandomNumber,
        entityB GeneralNames OPTIONAL
   }

 3.3. The "TokenBA2" PDU

   TokenBA2 is used in the mutual authentication mode and is sent by the
   server to the client. TokenBA2 contains an optional random number,
   optional certification information, and a signature of a DER-encoded
   value of type TBSDataBA. The certB field SHOULD be used to send the
   server's X.509 certificate and a related certificate chain to the
   client.

   TokenBA2 ::= SEQUENCE {
        randomC   RandomNumber OPTIONAL,
        entityA   [0] GeneralNames OPTIONAL,
        certB     [1] CertData OPTIONAL,

INTERNET DRAFT           9798-3 SASL Mechanism                  May 2000


        signature SIGNATURE { TBSDataBA }
   }(CONSTRAINED BY {-- The entityA field shall be included in TokenBA2
     -- if and only if it is also included in TBSDataBA. The entityA
     -- field SHOULD be present and MUST contain the client's name
     -- from their X.509 certificate.--})

   TBSDataBA ::= SEQUENCE {
        randomB RandomNumber,
        randomA RandomNumber,
        randomC RandomNumber OPTIONAL,
        entityA GeneralNames OPTIONAL
   }

   3.4. The "CertData" type

   The certification data is a choice between a set of certificates, a
   certificate URL, and a set of trusted authorities. The latter can be
   used by a server in its initial message ("TokenBA1") to indicate to a
   client preferred certificates/public key pairs to use in the
   authentication. It cannot be used in any other PDUs.

   The certificate set alternative is as in [RFC2630], meaning it is
   intended that the set be sufficient to contain chains from a
   recognized "root" or "top-level certification authority" to all of
   the sender certificates with which the set is associated.  However,
   there may be more certificates than necessary, or there may be fewer
   than necessary.

   Note - The precise meaning of a "chain" is outside the scope of this
          document.  Some applications may impose upper limits on the
          length of a chain; others may enforce certain relationships
          between the subjects and issuers of certificates within a
          chain.

   When the certURL type is used to specify the location at which the
   user's certificate can be found, it MUST be a non-relative URL, and
   MUST follow the URL syntax and encoding rules specified in [RFC1738].
   The URL must include both a scheme (e.g., "http" or "ldap") and a
   scheme-specific part.  The scheme-specific part must include a fully
   qualified domain name or IP address as the host.

   CertData ::= CHOICE {
        certificateSet     SET SIZE (1..MAX) OF Certificate,
        certURL            IA5String,
        trustedAuthorities SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Name
   }

 3.5. The "RandomNumber" type

INTERNET DRAFT           9798-3 SASL Mechanism                  May 2000


   A random number is simply defined as an octet string, at least 8
   bytes long.

   RandomNumber ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(8..MAX))

 3.6. The "SIGNATURE" type

   This is similar to the "SIGNED" parameterized type defined in
   [RFC2459], the difference being that the "SIGNATURE" type does not
   include the data to be signed.

   SIGNATURE { ToBeSigned } ::= SEQUENCE {
        algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
        signature BIT STRING
   }(CONSTRAINED BY {-- Must be the result of applying the signing
     -- operation indicated in "algorithm" to the DER-encoded octets of
     -- a value of type -- ToBeSigned })

 3.7. Other types

   The "GeneralNames" type is defined in [RFC2459].

4.  Supported Algorithms

   The following signature algorithms are recognized for use with this
   mechanism, and identified by a key.  Each key would be combined to
   make two possible SASL mechanisms.  For example the DSA-SHA1
   algorithm would give 9798-U-DSA-SHA1, and 9798-M-DSA-SHA1.  All
   algorithm names are constrained to 13 characters, to keep within the
   total SASL limit of 20 characters.

   The following table gives a list of algorithm keys, noting the object
   identifier and the body that assigned the identifier.

                 Key              Object Id           Body
                 RSA-SHA1-ENC   1.2.840.113549.1.1.5  RSA
                 DSA-SHA1       1.2.840.10040.4.3     ANSI
                 ECDSA-SHA1     1.2.840.10045.4.1     ANSI

   Support of the RSA-SHA1-ENC algorithm is recommended for use with
   this mechanism.

5.  Examples

 5.1. IMAP4 example

   The following example shows the use of the ISO/IEC 9798-3
   Authentication SASL mechanism with IMAP4 [RFC2060].

   The base64 encoding of challenges and responses, as well as the "+ "
   preceding the responses are part of the IMAP4 profile, not part of
   this specification itself (note that the line breaks in the sample
   authenticators are for editorial clarity and are not in real

6. IANA Considerations

   By registering the 9798-U-<algorithm> protocols as SASL mechanisms,
   implementers will have a well-defined way of adding this
   authentication mechanism to their product. Here is the registration
   template for the 9798-U-<algorithm> SASL mechanisms:

        SASL mechanism name:      9798-U-<algorithm> and
                                  9798-M-<algorithm> ; for a definition
                                  of <algorithm> see this memo.
        Security Considerations:  See corresponding section of this memo

        Author/Change controller: See author's address section below

7.  Security Considerations

   The mechanisms described in this memo only provides protection
   against passive eavesdropping attacks. They do not provide session
   privacy or protection from active attacks. In particular, man-in-
   the-middle attacks aimed at session "hi-jacking" are possible.

   The random numbers used in this protocol MUST be generated by a
   cryptographically strong random number generator. If the number is
   chosen from a small set or is otherwise predictable by a third party,
   then this mechanism can be attacked.

   The inclusion of the random number R_A in the signed part of TokenAB

   prevents the server from obtaining the signature of the client on
   data chosen by the server prior to the start of the authentication
   mechanism.  This measure may be required, for example, when the same
   key is used by the client for purposes other than entity
   authentication.  However, the inclusion of R_B in TokenBA2, whilst
   necessary for security reasons which dictate that the client should
   check that it is the same as the value sent in the first message, may
   not offer the same protection to the server, since R_B is known to
   the client before R_A is chosen. When this is a concern, servers MAY
   include a third random number, R_C, in the TokenBA2 PDU.
