                     Internet Threat Model Guidance
            draft-arkko-arch-internet-threat-model-guidance-00.txt

Abstract

   Communications security has been at the center of many security
   improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that
   communications are protected against outside observers and attackers.

   This memo suggests that the existing RFC 3552 threat model, while
   important and still valid, is no longer alone sufficient to cater for
   the pressing security and privacy issues seen on the Internet today.
   For instance, it is often also necessary to protect against endpoints
   that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not
   align with the interests of users.  While such protection is
   difficult, there are some measures that can be taken and we argue
   that investigation of these issues is warranted.

   It is particularly important to ensure that as we continue to develop
   Internet technology, non-communications security related threats, and
   privacy issues, are properly understood.

1.  Introduction

   Communications security has been at the center of many security
   improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that
   communications are protected against outside observers and attackers.
   At the IETF, this approach has been formalized in BCP 72 [RFC3552],
   which defined the Internet threat model in 2003.

   The purpose of a threat model is to outline what threats exist in
   order to assist the protocol designer.  But RFC 3552 also ruled some

   threats to be in scope and of primary interest, and some threats out
   of scope [RFC3552]:

      The Internet environment has a fairly well understood threat
      model.  In general, we assume that the end-systems engaging in a
      protocol exchange have not themselves been compromised.
      Protecting against an attack when one of the end-systems has been
      compromised is extraordinarily difficult.  It is, however,
      possible to design protocols which minimize the extent of the
      damage done under these circumstances.

      By contrast, we assume that the attacker has nearly complete
      control of the communications channel over which the end-systems
      communicate.  This means that the attacker can read any PDU
      (Protocol Data Unit) on the network and undetectably remove,
      change, or inject forged packets onto the wire.

   However, the communications-security -only threat model is becoming
   outdated.  Some of the causes for this are:

   *  Success!  Advances in protecting most of our communications with
      strong cryptographic means.  This has resulted in much improved
      communications security, but also highlights the need for
      addressing other, remaining issues.  This is not to say that
      communications security is not important, it still is.
      Fortunately, there are ongoing projects working on improvements.

   *  Adversaries have increased their pressure against other avenues of
      attack, from supply-channel attacks, to compromising devices to
      legal coercion of centralized endpoints in conversations.

   *  New adversaries and risks have arisen, e.g., due to creation of
      large centralized information sources.

   *  While communications-security does seem to be required to protect
      privacy, more is needed, especially if endpoints choose to act
      against the interests of their peers or users.

   In short, attacks are migrating towards the currently easier targets,
   which no longer necessarily include direct attacks on traffic flows.

   It is important that when it comes to basic Internet infrastructure,
   our chosen technologies lead to minimal exposure with respect to the
   non-communications threats.  It is particularly important to ensure
   that non-communications security related threats are properly
   understood for any new Internet technology.  The sole consideration
   of communications security aspects in designing Internet protocols
   may lead to accidental or increased impact of security issues

   elsewhere.  For instance, allowing a participant to unnecessarily
   collect or receive information may lead to a similar effect as
   described in [RFC8546] for protocols: over time, unnecessary
   information will get used with all the associated downsides,
   regardless of what deployment expectations there were during protocol
   design.

   The rest of this memo is organized as follows.  Section 2 makes some
   observations about the threa situation.  Section 3 discusses some
   high-level principles that could be used to address some of the
   emerging issues.

2.  Attack Landscape

   This section discusses the evolving landscape of security
   vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks.

2.1.  Communications Security Improvements

   Being able to ask about threat model improvements is due to progress
   already made: The fraction of Internet traffic that is
   cryptographically protected has grown tremendously in the last few
   years.  Several factors have contributed to this change, from Snowden
   revelations to business reasons and to better available technology
   such as HTTP/2 [RFC7540], TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], QUIC
   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

   In many networks, the majority of traffic has flipped from being
   cleartext to being encrypted.  Reaching the level of (almost) all
   traffic being encrypted is no longer something unthinkable but rather
   a likely outcome in a few years.

   At the same time, technology developments and policy choices have
   driven the scope of cryptographic protection from protecting only the
   pure payload to protecting much of the rest as well, including far
   more header and meta-data information than was protected before.  For
   instance, efforts are ongoing in the IETF to assist encrypting
   transport headers [I-D.ietf-quic-transport], server domain name
   information in TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-esni], and domain name queries
   [RFC8484].

   There have also been improvements to ensure that the security
   protocols that are in use actually have suitable credentials and that
   those credentials have not been compromised, see, for instance, Let's
   Encrypt [RFC8555], HSTS [RFC6797], HPKP [RFC7469], and Expect-CT
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-expect-ct].

   This is not to say that all problems in communications security have
   been resolved -- far from it.  But the situation is definitely
   different from what it was a few years ago.  Remaining issues will be
   and are worked on; the fight between defense and attack will also
   continue.  Communications security will stay at the top of the agenda
   in any Internet technology development.

2.2.  Beyond Communications Security

   There are issues beyond communications security in the Internet.  It
   is not necessarily clear that one can trust all the endpoints in any
   protocol interaction, including the user's own devices.  Managed or
   closed ecosystems with multiple layers of hardware and software have
   made it harder to understand or influence what your devices do.

   The situation is different, but not necessarily better on the side of
   servers.  Even for applications that are for user-to-user
   communication, a typical pattern of communications is almost always
   via an intermediary that has at least as much information as the
   other parties have.  For instance, these intermediaries are typically
   endpoints for any transport layer security connections, and able to
   see much communications or other messaging in cleartext.  There are
   some exceptions, of course, e.g., messaging applications with end-to-
   end confidentiality protection.

   For instance, while e-mail transport security [RFC7817] has become
   much more widely deployed in recent years, progress in securing
   e-mail messages between users has been much slower.  This has lead to
   a situation where e-mail content is considered a critical resource by
   some mail service providers who use the content for machine learning,
   advertisement targeting, and other purposes unrelated to message
   delivery.  Equally however, it is unclear how some useful anti-spam
   techniques could be deployed in an end-to-end encrypted mail universe
   (with today's end-to-end mail security protocols) and there are many
   significant challenges should one desire to deploy end-to-end email
   security at scale.

   Even services that are not about user-to-user to communication often
   collect information about the user.

   Services that are part of the infrastructure may have security
   issues.  For instance, despite progress in protecting DNS query
   protocols with encryption (see, e.g., [RFC7858] and [RFC8484]), DNS
   resolver services themselves may be targets for attack or sources for
   leaks.  For instance, the services may collect information or be
   vulnerable targets of denial-of-service attacks, attacks to steal
   user browsing history information, or be the target of surveillance
   activities and government information requests.  Infrastructure

Internet-Draft       Internet Threat Model Guidance            July 2021


   services with information about a large number of users is collected
   in small number of services are particularly attractive targets for
   these attacks.

   In general, many recent attacks relate more to information than
   communications.  For instance, personal information leaks typically
   happen via information stored on a compromised server rather than
   capturing communications.  There is little hope that such attacks can
   be prevented entirely.  Again, the best course of action seems to be
   avoid the disclosure of information in the first place, or at least
   to not perform that in a manner that makes it possible that others
   can readily use the information.

2.3.  Accidental Vulnerabilities

   Some vulnerabilities came to being through various levels of
   carelessness and/or due to erroneous assumptions about the
   environments in which those applications currently run at.  A
   vulnerability can be exploited to misuse the data for someone's own
   purposes.

   Some attacks in this category include hardware-related issues, for
   example, Meltdown and Spectre [MeltdownAndSpectre], compromised or
   badly-maintained web sites or services, e.g., [Passwords], supply-
   chain attacks, for example, the [TargetAttack], and breaches of major
   service providers, that many of us might have assumed would be
   sufficiently capable to be the best large-scale "Identity providers",
   for example, Yahoo (https://www.wired.com/story/yahoo-breach-three-
   billion-accounts/), Facebook (https://www.pcmag.com/news/367319/
   facebook-stored-up-to-600m-user-passwords-in-plain-text and many
   others.

2.4.  Misbehaving Applications

   There are many examples of application developers doing their best to
   protect the security and privacy of their users or customers.  But
   there are also some that do not act int he best interests of their
   users.  As a result, it becomes necessary to consider applications as
   potentially untrusted, much in the same way that we consider in-
   network actors as potential adversaries despite the many examples of
   network operators who both act in the best interests of their users
   and succeed in defending against attacks from others.

   This can also happen indirectly.  Despite the best efforts of
   curators, so-called App-Stores frequently distribute malware of many
   kinds.

Internet-Draft       Internet Threat Model Guidance            July 2021


   Applications may also mislead users.  Many web sites today provide
   some form of privacy policy and terms of service, that are known to
   be mostly unread [Unread].  This implies that, legal fiction aside,
   users of those sites have not in reality agreed to the specific terms
   published and so users are therefore highly exposed to being
   exploited by web sites, for example [Cambridge] is a recent well-
   publicised case where a service provider abused the data of 87
   million users via a partnership.

2.5.  Untrustworthy Devices

   Traditionally, there's been an implied trust in various parts of the
   system -- such as the user's own device, nodes inside a particular
   network perimeter, or nodes under a single administrative control.

   Client endpoint implementations were never fully trusted, but the
   environments in which those endpoints exist are changing.  Users may
   not have as much control over their own devices as they used to, due
   to manufacturer-controlled operating system installations and locked
   device ecosystems.  And within those ecosystems, even the
   applications that are available tend to have privileges that users by
   themselves might not desire those applications be granted, such as
   excessive rights to media, location, and peripherals.  There are also
   designated efforts by various authorities to hack end-user devices as
   a means of intercepting data about the user.

   Examples of these issues are too many to list, for instance, so-
   called "smart" televisions spying on their owners and one survey of
   user attitudes [SmartTV].  Untrustworthy devices can also cause
   damage to other parties, such as badly constructed IoT devices
   [DynDDoS] attacking large Internet services.

2.6.  Untrustworthy "Closed" Networks

   Even in a closed network with carefully managed components there may
   be compromised components, as evidenced in the most extreme way by
   the Stuxnet worm that operated in an airgapped network.  Every system
   runs large amount of software, and it is often not practical or even
   possible to prevent compromised code even in a high-security setting,
   let alone in commercial or private networks.  Installation media,
   physical ports, both open source and proprietary programs, firmware,
   or even innocent-looking components on a circuit board can be suspect
   [TinyChip].  In addition, complex underlying computing platforms,
   such as modern CPUs with underlying security and management tools are
   prone to problems.

2.7.  Tracking

   One of the biggest threats to user privacy on the Web is ubiquitous
   tracking.  This is often done to support advertising based business
   models, or more specifically advertising based business models that
   attempt to find out information about the user.

   While some people may be sanguine about this kind of tracking, others
   consider this behaviour unwelcome, when or if they are informed that
   it happens.  Historically, browsers have not made this kind of
   tracking visible and have enabled it by default, though some recent
   browser versions are starting to enable visibility and blocking of
   some kinds of tracking.

   One form of tracking is by third parties.  HTTP header fields (such
   as cookies, [RFC6265]) are commonly used for such tracking, as are
   structures within the content of HTTP responses such as links to 1x1
   pixel images and (ab)use of Javascript APIs offered by browsers
   [Tracking].  Whenever a resource is loaded from a server, that server
   can include a cookie which will be sent back to the server on future
   loads.  The combination of these features makes it possible to track
   a user across the Web.

   This capability itself constitutes a major threat to user privacy.
   Additional techniques such as cookie syncing, identifier correlation,
   and fingerprinting make the problem even worse
   [I-D.wood-pearg-website-fingerprinting].  For instance, features such
   as User-Agent string, plugin and font support, screen resolution, and
   timezone can yield a fingerprint that is sometimes unique to a single
   user [AmIUnique] and which persists beyond cookie scope and lifetime.

   Third party web tracking is not the only concern.  An obvious
   tracking danger exists also in popular ecosystems -- such as social
   media networks -- that house a large part of many users' online
   existence.  There is no need for a third party to track the user's
   browsing as all actions are performed within a single site, where
   most messaging, viewing, and sharing activities happen.

   Browsers themselves or services used by the browser can also become a
   potential source of tracking users.  For instance, the URL/search bar
   service may leak information about the user's actions to a search
   provider via an "autocomplete" feature.  [Leith2020]

   Tracking through users' IP addresses or DNS queries is also a danger.
   This may happen by directly observing the cleartext IP or DNS
   traffic, though DNS tracking may be preventable via DNS protocols
   that are secured end-to-end.  But the DNS queries are also (by




Arkko & Farrell          Expires 13 January 2022                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       Internet Threat Model Guidance            July 2021


   definition) seen by the used DNS recursive resolver service, which
   may accidentally or otherwise track the users' activities.

   Tracking happens through other systems besides the web, of course.
   For instance, some mail user agents (MUAs) render HTML content by
   default (with a subset not allowing that to be turned off, perhaps
   particularly on mobile devices) and thus enable the same kind of
   adversarial tracking seen on the web.

   One of the concerns with universal user tracking is that it provides
   yet another avenue for pervasive surveillance [RFC7258], e.g.,
   intelligence agencies can tap into the databases constructed by user
   tracking.

3.  Principles

   Based on the above issues, it is necessary to pay attention to the
   following aspects:

   *  Security of devices, including the user's own devices.

   *  Security of data at rest or in use, in various parts of the
      system.

   *  Tracking and identification of users and their devices.

   *  Role of servers, and in particular information passing through
      them.

   These topics are discussed below.  There are obviously many detailed
   technical questions and approaches to tackling them.  However, in
   this memo we wish to focus on higher level architectural principles
   that might guide us in thinking about about the topics.

3.1.  Trusting Devices

   In general, this means that one cannot entirely trust even a closed
   system where you picked all the components yourself, let alone
   typical commercial, networked and Internet-connected systems.

   PRINCIPLE: Consider all system components as potentially
   untrustworthy, and consider the implications of their compromise.

   There may also be ways to mitigate damages, should a compromise
   occur.

Internet-Draft       Internet Threat Model Guidance            July 2021


3.2.  Protecting Information

   Data leaks have become the primary concern.  Even trusted, well-
   managed parties can be problematic, such as when large data stores
   attract attempts to use that data in a manner that is not consistent
   with the users' interests.

   Mere encryption of communications is not sufficient to protect
   information.

   PRINCIPLE: Consider information passed to another party as a
   publication.  Avoid passing information that should not be published.

   This principle applies even if the communications that carry that
   information are encrypted.

   PRINCIPLE: Build defences to protect information, even when some
   component in a system is compromised.

   For instance, encryption of data at rest or in use may assist in
   protecting information when an attacker gainst access to a server
   system.

   PRINCIPLE: Trust that information is handled appropriately, but
   verify that this is actually the case.

   It is not wise to merely trust that someone acts correctly, without
   mistakes, and does not misuse your information.  When we send packets
   over the Internet, we encrypt them and know that they can only
   received by a specific party.  Similarly, if we send information to a
   server, we can, for instance:

   *  encrypt a message only to the actual final recipient, even if the
      server holds our message before it is delivered

   *  verify (e.g., through confidential computing attestations) that
      the server runs a software that we know does not leak our
      information

3.3.  Tracking

   Information leakage is particularly harmful in situations where the
   information can be traced to an individual, such as is the case with
   any information that users would consider private, be it about
   messages to another users, browsing history, or even user's medical
   information.

Internet-Draft       Internet Threat Model Guidance            July 2021


   PRINCIPLE: Assume that every interaction with another party can
   result in fingerprinting or identification of the user in question.

   In many cases there are readily available user identifiers in data
   that is leaked.  But even when such identifiers are not present,
   there is often an opportunity to narrow down which entity is
   connecting, through, for instance, geolocation or fingerprinting.

3.4.  Role of End-to-End

   [RFC1958] noted that "end-to-end functions can best be realised by
   end-to-end protocols".  This functional argument aligns with other,
   practical arguments about the evolution of the Internet under the
   end-to-end model.  The endpoints evolve quickly, often with simply
   having one party change the necessary software on both ends.  The
   end-to-end model supports permissionless innovation where new
   innovation can flourish in the Internet without excessive wait for
   other parties to act.

   However, there is a significant difference between actual endpoints
   from a user's interaction perspective (e.g., another user) and from a
   system perspective (e.g., a party relaying a message).  In general,
   there needs to be distinction between the intended interaction
   participants and the services used to carry this interaction out.
   These services are typically implemented as servers that provide,
   e.g., the messaging relay function.

   Thomson [I-D.thomson-tmi] discusses the role of intermediaries.  We
   prefer to use the term services to underline how all types of
   services can have issues -- including the simple case of an end-user
   contacting a server for some information.

   In any case, as Thomson points out, intermediaries (or services) can
   provide a useful function.  Networks themselves would not exist
   without intermediaries that can forward communications to others.
   Similarly, networks would not exist without services responding to
   communications sent by end users.

   PRINCIPLE: Set clear limits what all services can do, and minimise
   the use of those services to cases where they are necessary.

   This is a general rule, but perhaps a few examples can illustrate it:

   *  A router's role is to efficiently forward packets to their
      destination, not to differentiate the treatment based on what
      content is being carried.





Arkko & Farrell          Expires 13 January 2022               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft       Internet Threat Model Guidance            July 2021


   *  The role of an information service web server is to provide that
      information, not to gather the identity or personal information
      about the user accessing information.

   *  The role of a messaging service is to deliver messages to other
      users, not to process the contents of the messages.

   Note that this principle applies at multiple layers in the stack.  It
   is not just about intermediaries in the network and transport layers,
   but also intermediaries and services on the application layer.

   PRINCIPLE: Pass information only between the "real ends" of a
   conversation, unless the information is necessary for a useful
   function in a service.

   For instance, a transport connection between two components of a
   system is not an end-to-end connection even if it encompasses all the
   protocol layers up to the application layer.  It is not end-to-end,
   if the information or control function it carries actually extends
   beyond those components.  For instance, just because an e-mail server
   can read the contents of an e-mail message does not make it a
   legitimate recipient of the e-mail.

   PRINCIPLE: Information should not be disclosed, stored, or routed in
   cleartext through services that do not absolutely need to have that
   information for the function they perform.

   This the "need to know" principle.  It also relates to the discussion
   in [I-D.thomson-tmi], in that the valuable functions provided by
   intermediaries need to be balanced against the information that they
   need to perform their function.

4.  Security Considerations

   The entire memo covers the security considerations.
