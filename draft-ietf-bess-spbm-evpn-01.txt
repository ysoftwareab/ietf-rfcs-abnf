                       draft-ietf-bess-spbm-evpn-01 


Abstract 


   This document describes how Ethernet Shortest Path Bridging MAC mode 
   (802.1aq) can be combined with EVPN to interwork with PBB-PEs as 
   described in the PBB-EVPN solution. This is achieved via   
   operational isolation of each Ethernet network subtending an EVPN 
   core while supporting full interworking between the different 
   variations of Ethernet networks.

1. Introduction 

   This document describes how Ethernet Shortest Path Bridging MAC mode 
   (SPBM) along with Provider Backbone Bridging Provider Edges (PBB-PEs) 
   and Provider Backbone Bridged Networks (PBBNs) can be supported by 
   Ethernet VPNs (EVPNs) such that each SPBM island is operationally

   isolated while providing full L2 connectivity between the different 
   types of PBBNs where desired. Each SPBM island uses its own control 
   plane instance and multi-pathing design, be it multiple equal cost 
   tree sets, or multiple spanning trees.  

   The intention is to permit past, current and emerging future versions 
   of Ethernet to be seamlessly interconnected to permit large scale, 
   geographically diverse numbers of Ethernet end systems to be fully 
   supported with EVPN as the unifying system.

3. Solution Overview 

   The EVPN solution for 802.1aq SPBM incorporates control plane 
   interworking in the PE to map ISIS-SPB [RFC6329] information elements 
   into the EVPN Next Layer Reachabilty Information (NLRI) and vice 
   versa. This requires each PE to act both as an EVPN BGP speaker and 
   as an ISIS-SPB edge node. Associated with this are procedures for 
   configuring the forwarding operations of the PE such that an 
   arbitrary number of EVPN subtending SPBM islands may be 
   interconnected without any topological or multipathing dependencies. 
   This model also permits PBB-PEs as defined in [PBB-EVPN] to 
   seamlessly communicate with the SPBM islands.

   SPBM networks may be multi-homed onto an IP/MPLS network that 
   implements EVPN for the purpose of interconnect with other SPBM 
   networks, and/or PBB PEs. The multipathing configuration of each SPBM 
   network can be unique as the backbone VLAN ID (B-VID) configuration 
 
Allan et al.,             Expires April 2016                   [Page 4]

   (how multi-pathing is performed in SPBM) is not propagated across the 
   IP/MPLS network implementing EVPN. As with PBB networking the B-VID 
   is local to the SPBM network so in SPBM a B-MAC associated with B-VID 
   is advertised with the supported I-SIDs at the PBB gateway.  
    
   Each EVPN is identified by a route target. I-SID Based Load-balancing 
   in [PBB-EVPN] which allows multiple gateways per B-VID (each with 
   different I-SIDs) across the EVPN is supported by the interworking 
   between PBBNs and SPBM networks.  However SPBM only allows a single 
   active designated forwarder per B-VID as described below. The route 
   target identifies the set of SPBM islands and PBB-PEs that are 
   allowed to communicate. Each SPBM island is administered to have an 
   associated Ethernet Segment ID (ESI) extended community associated 
   with it.  
   BGP acts as a common repository of the I Component Service ID (I-SID) 
   attachment points for the set of subtending PEs/SPBM islands. This is 
   in the form of B-MAC address/I-SID/Tx-Rx-attribute tuples. BGP 
   distributes I-SID information into each SPBM island on the basis of 
   locally registered interest. If an SPBM island has no backbone edge 
   bridges (BEBs) registering interest in a particular I-SID, 
   information about that I-SID from other SPBM islands, PBB-PEs or 
   PBBNs MUST NOT be leaked into the local ISIS-SPB routing system. 
   For each B-VID in an SPBM island, a single SPBM-PE MUST be elected 
   the designated forwarder (DF) for the B-VID. An SPBM-PE may be a DF 
   for more than one B-VID. This is described further in section 4.2. 
   The SPBM-PE originates IS-IS advertisements as if it were an IB-BEB 
   that proxies for the other SPBM islands and PBB PEs in the EVPN 
   defined by the route target, but the PE typically will not actually 
   host any I-components. 
   An SPBM-PE that is a DF for a B-VID MUST strip the B-VID tag 
   information from frames relayed towards the EVPN. The DF MUST also 
   insert the appropriate B-VID tag information into frames relayed 
   towards the SPBM island on the basis of the local I-SID/B-VID 
   bindings advertised in ISIS-SPB. 
                                   
4. Elements of Procedure 

   A PE MUST implement the following procedures: 

4.1. PE Configuration 

   At SPBM island commissioning a PE is configured with: 


 
Allan et al.,             Expires April 2016                   [Page 5] 
 
Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-bess-spbm-evpn-01        September 2015 
 

   1) The route target for the service instance. Where a route target 
      is defined as identifying the set of SPBM islands, PBBNs and PBB-
      PEs to be interconnected by the EVPN. 

   2) The unique ESI for the SPBM island. Mechanisms for deriving a 
      unique ESI for the SPBM island are out of scope. 

   The following is configured as part of commissioning an ISIS-SPB 
   node: 

   1) A Shortest Path Source ID (SPSourceID) used for algorithmic 
      construction of multicast addresses. Note this is required for 
      SPBM BEB operation independent of the EVPN operation. 

   2) The set of B-VIDs used in the SPBM island and multi-pathing 
      algorithm IDs to use for each. The set of B-VIDs and multi-
      pathing algorithms used may be different in different domains. 
      Therefore the B-VID is local to an SPBM domain and is removed for 
      frames carried over the IP/MPLS network. 

   A type-1 Route Distinguisher for the node can be auto-derived. The 
   actual procedure is out of scope of this document.  

4.2. DF Election 

   PEs self appoint themselves for the role of DF for a B-VID for a 
   given SPBM island. The procedure used is as per section 8.5 of 
   [RFC7432] "Designated Forwarder election". 
   A PE that assumes the role of DF for a given B-VID is responsible for 
   originating specific information into BGP from ISIS-SPB and vice 
   versa. A PE that ceases to perform the role of DF for a given B-VID 
   is responsible for withdrawing the associated information from BGP 
   and ISIS-SPB respectively. The actual information exchanged is 
   outlined in the following sections. 
    
4.3. Control plane interworking ISIS-SPB to EVPN 

   When a PE receives an SPBM service identifier and unicast address 
   sub-TLV as part of an ISIS-SPB MT capability TLV it checks if it is 
   the DF for the B-VID in the sub-TLV. 

   If it is the DF, and there is new or changed information then a 
   MAC/IP advertisement route NLRI is created for each new I-SID in the 
   sub-TLV. Changed information that results in modification to existing 
   NLRI are processed accordingly.

   - the Route Distinguisher is set to that of the PE. 

   - the ESI is that of the SPBM island. 

   - the Ethernet tag ID contains the I-SID (including the Tx/Rx 
     attributes). The encoding of I-SID information is as per figure 2.

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |T|R| Reserved  |                 I-SID                         | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
         Figure 2: I-SID encoding in the Ethernet tag-ID field 

   - the MAC address is copied from the sub-TLV 

   - a locally assigned MPLS label  

   Similarly in the scenario where a PE became elected DF for a B-VID in 
   an operating network, the IS-IS database would be processed in order 
   to construct the NLRI information associated with the new role of the 
   PE. 

   If the BGP database has NLRI information for the I-SID, and this is 
   the first instance of registration of interest in the I-SID from the 
   SPBM island, the NLRI information with that tag is processed to 
   construct an updated set of SPBM service identifier and unicast 
   address sub-TLVs to be advertised by the PE. 

   The ISIS-SPB information is also used to keep current a local table 
   indexed by I-SID to indicate the associated B-VID for processing of 
   frames received from EVPN. When an I-SID is associated with more than 
   one B-VID, only one entry is allowed in the table. Rules for 
   preventing this are out of scope of this memo.  

4.4. Control plane interworking EVPN to ISIS-SPB 

   When a PE receives a BGP NLRI that has new information, it checks if 
   it is the elected DF to communicate this information into ISIS-SPB by 
   checking if the I-SID in the Ethernet Tag ID locally maps to the B-
   VID it is an elected DF for. Note that if no BEBs in the SPB island 
   have advertised any interest in the I-SID, it will not be associated 
   with any B-VID locally, and therefore not of interest. If the I-SID 
 
Allan et al.,             Expires April 2016                   [Page 7] 
 
Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-bess-spbm-evpn-01        September 2015 
 

   is of local interest to the SPBM island and the PE is the DF for the 
   B-VID that the I-SID is locally mapped to, a SPBM service identifier 
   and unicast address sub-TLV is constructed/updated for advertisement 
   into ISIS-SPB. 

   The NLRI information advertised into ISIS-SPB is also used to locally 
   populate a forwarding table indexed by B-MAC+I-SID that points to the 
   label stack to impose on the SPBM frame. The bottom label in the 
   stack being that obtained from the NLRI. 

4.5. Data plane Interworking 802.1aq SPBM island or PBB-PE to EVPN 

   When an PE receives a frame from the SPBM island in a B-VID for which 
   it is a DF, it looks up the B-MAC/I-SID information to determine the 
   label stack to be added to the frame for forwarding in the EVPN. The 
   PE strips the B-VID information from the frame, adds the label 
   information to the frame and forwards the resulting MPLS packet. 

4.6. Data plane Interworking EVPN to 802.1aq SPBM island 

   When a PE receives a packet from the EVPN it may infer the B-VID to 
   overwrite in the SPBM frame from the I-SID or by other means (such as 
   via the bottom label in the MPLS stack).  

   If the frame has a local multicast destination address (DA), it 
   overwrites the SPsourceID in the frame with the local SPsourceID. 

4.7. Data plane interworking EVPN to 802.1ah PBB-PE 

   A PBB-PE actually has no subtending PBBN nor concept of B-VID so no 
   frame processing is required. 

   A PBB-PE is required to accept SPBM encoded multicast DAs as if they 
   were 802.1ah encoded multicast DAs. The only information of interest 
   being that it is a multicast frame, and the I-SID encoded in the 
   lower 24 bits. 

4.8. Multicast Support 

   Within a PBBN domain Ethernet Unicast and Multicast end services are 
   supported. PBB can tunnel multicast traffic in Unicast PBB frames 
   when using head end replication. This is the only form of multicast 
   traffic interworking supported by this document. Native PBB multicast 
   forwarding over EVPN, PE replication or optimizing PBB multicast 
   across the EVPN is not addressed by this memo.

5. Other Aspects 

5.1. Transit 

   Any PE that does not need to participate in the tandem calculations 
   at the B-MAC layer may use the IS-IS overload bit to exclude SPBM 
   tandem paths and behave as pure interworking platform.

7. Security Considerations 

   Security issues associated with incorrect interconnect of customer 
   LANs cannot be directly addressed by implementations of this 
   document, as it requires misconfiguration in the Shortest Path 
   Bridging domains. The identifiers so administered have global 
   significance to the larger system. They are relayed transparently by 
   EVPN and only policed in the SPBM domains. Therefore care is required 
   in synchronization of identifiers that need to be common for inter-
   domain operation. 

   There are only two identifiers unique to this solution provisioned at 
   an SPBM-PE at service turn up; the route target and the ESI. The ESI 
   needs to be unique and common to all SPBM-PEs connected to a common 
   SPBM network, or PBBN else portions of the overall network will not 
   share reachability (EVPN will assume that separate networks are 
   interconnected by SPBM). Security issues exist when SPBM domains are 
   incorrectly cross connected together via EVPN which will result in 
   back-holing or incorrect delivery of data with associated privacy 
   issues. This could be achieved by provisioning the incorrect RT value 
   at an SPBM-PE or associating the RT with the wrong interface. This 
   can be avoided via care in route target provisioning at SPBM-PEs for 
   service adds and changes. 

   The potentially most destructive behavior of the overall system would 
   be frequent changes to the DF elections for a given ESI. This would 
   require SPBM-PEs to frequently flap in the form of either the node 
   continuously resetting or links flapping in a form that keeps 
   severing and re-connecting the SPBM-PE from either the IP/MPLS 
   network or the subtending SPBM-Network. Either of these scenarios 
   would result in significant control plane traffic as DF associated 
   information was advertised and withdrawn from both the SPBM and BGP 
   control planes. Dual homing of SPBM-PEs on both networks would 
   minimize the likelihood of this scenario occurring.
