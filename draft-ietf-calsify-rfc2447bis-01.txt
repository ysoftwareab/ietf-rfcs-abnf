1 Introduction

   This binding document provides the transport specific information
   necessary to convey iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability
   Protocol (iTIP) over MIME as defined in [RFC-2822] and [RFC-2045].

1.1 Related Memos

   Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that,
   along with this memo, form a framework for Internet calendaring and
   scheduling standards.

   This document, [iMIP], specifies an Internet email binding for iTIP.

   [iCAL] - specifies a core specification of objects, data types,
   properties and property parameters;





Melnikov (Ed.)               Standards Track            FORMFEED[Page 3]





RFC 2447bis                       iMIP                        March 2006


   [iTIP] - specifies an interoperability protocol for scheduling
   between different implementations;

   This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts or
   definitions from these other memos. Where possible, references are
   made to the memo that provides for the specification of these
   concepts or definitions.

1.2 Formatting Conventions

   The mechanisms defined in this memo are defined in prose. In order to
   refer to elements of the calendaring and scheduling model, core
   object or interoperability protocol defined in [iCAL] and [iTIP] some
   formatting conventions have been used.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

   Calendaring and scheduling roles are referred to in quoted-strings of
   text with the first character of each word in upper case. For
   example, "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User" within the
   scheduling protocol defined by [iTIP].

   Calendar components defined by [iCAL] are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text. All calendar components start
   with the letter "V". For example, "VEVENT" refers to the event
   calendar component, "VTODO" refers to the to-do calendar component
   and "VJOURNAL" refers to the daily journal calendar component.

   Scheduling methods defined by [iTIP] are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text. For example, "REQUEST" refers to
   the method for requesting a scheduling calendar component be created
   or modified, "REPLY" refers to the method a recipient of a request
   uses to update their status with the "Organizer" of the calendar
   component.

   Properties defined by [iCAL] are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property". For example,
   "ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to convey
   the calendar address of a calendar user.

   Property parameters defined by [iCAL] are referred to with lower
   case, quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "parameter". For
   example, "value" parameter refers to the iCalendar property parameter
   used to override the default data type for a property value.

1.3 Terminology

   The email terms used in this memo are defined in [RFC-2822] and
   [RFC-2045]. The calendaring and scheduling terms used in this memo
   are defined in [iCAL] and [iTIP].

2 MIME Message Format Binding

   This section defines the message binding to the MIME electronic mail
   transport.

   The sections below refer to the "originator" and the "respondent" of
   an iMIP message. Typically, the originator is the "Organizer" of an
   event.  The respondent is an "Attendee" of the event.

   The [RFC-2822] "Reply-To" header typically contains the email address
   of the originator or respondent of an event. However, this cannot be
   guaranteed as Mail User Agents (MUA) are not required to enforce iMIP
   semantics.

2.1 MIME Media Type

   A MIME entity containing content information formatted according to
   this document will be referenced as a "text/calendar" content type.
   It is assumed that this content type will be transported through a
   MIME electronic mail transport.

2.2 Security

   This section addresses several aspects of security including
   Authentication, Authorization and Confidentiality. Authentication and
   confidentiality can be achieved using [RFC-1847] that specifies the
   Security Multiparts for MIME. This framework defines new content
   types and subtypes of multipart: signed and encrypted. Each contains
   two body parts: one for the protected data and another for the
   control information necessary to remove the protection.

2.2.1 Authorization

   In [iTIP] messages, only the "Organizer" is authorized to modify or
   cancel calendar entries they organize. That is, spoof@xyz.example.net
   is not allowed to modify or cancel a meeting that was organized by
   a@example.com. Furthermore, only the respondent has the authorization
   to indicate their status to the "Organizer". That is, the "Organizer"
   must ignore an [iTIP] message from spoof@xyz.example.net that
   declines a meeting invitation for b@example.com.

RFC 2447bis                       iMIP                        March 2006


   Implementations of iMIP SHOULD verify the authenticity of the creator
   of an iCalendar object before taking any action. The methods for
   doing this are presented later in this document.

   [RFC-1847] Message flow in iTIP supports someone working on behalf of
   a "Calendar User" through use of the "sent-by" parameter that is
   associated with the "ATTENDEE" and "ORGANIZER" properties. However,
   there is no mechanism to verify whether or not a "Calendar User" has
   authorized someone to work on their behalf. It is left to
   implementations to provide mechanisms for the "Calendar Users" to
   make that decision.

2.2.2 Authentication

   Authentication can be performed using an implementation of [RFC-1847]
   "multipart/signed" that supports public/private key certificates.
   Authentication is possible only on messages that have been signed.
   Authenticating an unsigned message may not be reliable.

2.2.3 Confidentiality

   To ensure confidentiality using iMIP implementations should utilize
   [RFC-1847]-compliant encryption. The protocol does not restrict a
   "Calendar User Agent" (CUA) from forwarding iCalendar objects to
   other users or agents.

2.3 [RFC-2822] Addresses

   The calendar address specified within the "ATTENDEE" property in an
   iCalendar object MUST be a fully qualified, [RFC-2822] address
   specification for the corresponding "Organizer" or "Attendee" of the
   "VEVENT" or "VTODO".

   Because [iTIP] does not preclude "Attendees" from forwarding
   "VEVENTS" or "VTODOS" to others, the [RFC-2822] "Sender" value may
   not equal that of the "Organizer". Additionally, the "Organizer" or
   "Attendee" cannot be reliably inferred by the [RFC-2822] "Sender" or
   "Reply-to" values of an iMIP message. The relevant address MUST be
   ascertained by opening the "text/calendar" MIME body part and
   examining the "ATTENDEE" and "ORGANIZER" properties.

2.4 Content Type

   A MIME body part containing content information that conforms to this
   document MUST have an [RFC-2045] "Content-Type" value of
   "text/calendar". The [RFC-2045] "Content-Type" header field MUST also
   include the type parameter "method". The value MUST be the same as
   the value of the "METHOD" calendar property within the iCalendar



Melnikov (Ed.)               Standards Track            FORMFEED[Page 6]





RFC 2447bis                       iMIP                        March 2006


   object.  This means that a MIME message containing multiple iCalendar
   objects with different method values must be further encapsulated
   with a "multipart/mixed" MIME entity. This will allow each of the
   iCalendar objects to be encapsulated within their own "text/calendar"
   MIME entity.

   Note that according to [iCAL] the default character set for iCalendar
   objects is UTF-8 [UTF-8].  However the default character set for an
   RFC 2822 message is US-ASCII.  Thus a "charset" parameter MUST be
   present if the iCalendar object contains characters that are not part
   of the US-ASCII character set. [RFC-2046] discusses the selection of
   an appropriate "charset" value.

   The optional "component" parameter defines the iCalendar component
   type contained within the iCalendar object.

   The following is an example of this header field with a value that
   indicates an event message.

        Content-Type: text/calendar; method=request; charset=UTF-8;
              component=vevent

   The "text/calendar" content type allows for the scheduling message
   type to be included in a MIME message with other content information
   (i.e., "multipart/mixed") or included in a MIME message with a clear-
   text, human-readable form of the scheduling message (i.e.,
   "multipart/alternative").

   In order to permit the information in the scheduling message to be
   understood by MIME user agents (UA) that do not support the
   "text/calendar" content type, scheduling messages SHOULD be sent with
   an alternative, human-readable form of the information.

   Note that "multiple/alternative" MUST NOT be used to represent two
   slightly different iCalendar objects, for example two VEVENT with
   alternative starting times.

   Any receiving UA compliant with this specification MUST be able to
   process "text/calendar" body parts enclosed within "multipart/*".
   Note that a "multipart/mixed" MIME message can include multiple
   "text/calendar" components. The receiving UA MUST be able to process
   all of them.  <<Should infinite multipart/mixed nesting be allowed?>>

2.5 Content-Transfer-Encoding

   Unless iMIP message is transported over 8-bit clean transport (such
   as SMTP [8BITMIME]), a transfer encoding such as quoted-printable or
   base64 [RFC 2045] MUST be used for iCalendar objects containing any

RFC 2447bis                       iMIP                        March 2006


   characters that are not part of the US-ASCII character set.

   <<Add examples of 8bit and quoted-printable>>

2.6 Content-Disposition

   Implementations MAY include a "Content-Disposition" header field to
   define a file name for an iCalendar object.  However, the handling of
   a MIME part MUST be based on its [RFC-2045] "Content-Type" and not on
   the extension specified in the "Content-Disposition", as different
   email malware is known to trick User Agents into misinterpreting
   content of messages by specifying a file extension in the Content-
   Disposition header field that doesn't correspond to the value of
   Content-Type header field.

3 Security Considerations

   The security threats that applications must address when implementing
   iTIP are detailed in [iTIP]. Two spoofing threats are identified:
   Spoofing the "Organizer", and Spoofing an "Attendee". To address
   these threats, the originator of an iCalendar object must be
   authenticated by a recipient. Once authenticated, a determination can
   be made as to whether or not the originator is authorized to perform
   the requested operation. Compliant applications MUST support signing
   and encrypting text/calendar attachments using a mechanism based on
   Security Multiparts for MIME [RFC-1847] to facilitate the
   authentication the originator of the iCalendar object.
   Implementations MAY provide a means for users to disable signing and
   encrypting. The steps are described below:

   1. The iCalendar object MUST be signed by the "Organizer" sending an
   update or the "Attendee" sending a reply.

   2. Using the [RFC-1847]-compliant security mechanism, determine who
   signed the iCalendar object. This is the "signer". Note that the
   signer is not necessarily the person sending an e-mail message since
   an e-mail message can be forwarded.

   3. Correlate the signer to an "ATTENDEE" property in the iCalendar
   object. If the signer cannot be correlated to an "ATTENDEE" property,
   ignore the message.

   4. Determine whether or not the "ATTENDEE" is authorized to perform
   the operation as defined by [iTIP]. If the conditions are not met,
   ignore the message.

   5. If all the above conditions are met, the message can be processed.

   To address the confidentiality security threats, signed iMIP messages
   SHOULD be encrypted by a mechanism based on Security Multiparts for
   MIME [RFC-1847].

   It is possible to receive iMIP messages sent by someone working on
   behalf of another "Calendar User". This is determined by examining
   the "sent-by" parameter in the relevant "ORGANIZER" or "ATTENDEE"
   property.  [iCAL] and [iTIP] provide no mechanism to verify that a
   "Calendar User" has authorized someone else to work on their behalf.
   To address this security issue, implementations MUST provide
   mechanisms for the "Calendar Users" to make that decision before
   applying changes from someone working on behalf of a "Calendar User".

   A security consideration associated with use of Content-Disposition
   header field is described in section 2.6.

4.6 Detailed Components With An ATTACH Property

   This example shows the format of a message containing a group meeting
   between three individuals. The multipart/related encapsulation is
   used because the iCalendar object contains an ATTACH property that
   uses a CID to reference the attachment.

5 Recommended Practices

   This section outlines a series of recommended practices when using a
   messaging transport to exchange iCalendar objects.

5.1 Use of Content and Message IDs

   The [iCAL] specification makes frequent use of the URI for data types
   in properties such as "DESCRIPTION", "ATTACH", "CONTACT" and others.
   Two forms of URIs are Message ID (MID) and Content ID (CID). These
   are defined in [RFC-2392]. Although [RFC-2392] allows referencing
   messages or MIME body parts in other MIME entities or stores, it is
   strongly recommended that iMIP implementations include all referenced
   messages and body parts in a single MIME entity. Simply put, if an
   iCalendar object contains CID or MID references to other messages or
   body parts, implementations should ensure that these messages and/or
   body parts are transmitted with the iCalendar object. If they are not
   there is no guarantee that the receiving CUA will have the access or
   the authorization to view those objects.
