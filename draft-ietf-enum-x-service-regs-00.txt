Internet-Draft         X-Enumservice Registrations              Nov 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document provides a guide to the creation of new IANA
   registrations of X-Enumservices.  This document aims to enhance
   section 3 of RFC 3761 [3], where the registration procedure for
   Enumservices was initially documented at a high level.  It further
   complements the Guide and Template for IANA Registrations of
   Enumservices [2].

   The X-Enumservice registration is intended to allow people to use the
   template for ordinary Enumservices to describe what X-Enumservice
   strings exist in NAPTR Resource Records and to describe how they are
   used, but not (yet) to require a full IETF review and change control.

   This is needed as some trials use URL schemes that are not
   registered, and so cannot be used in Standards Track Enumservice
   registrations.  Also, until trials have been completed, it may not be
   appropriate to produce a Standards Track document, as Enumservice
   syntax details, use and issues of security / privacy may not have
   been analyzed fully at that point.

   For the purpose of this document, 'x-registration document' and
   'x-registration' refer to an Internet Draft proposing the IANA
   registration of an X-Enumservice following the procedures outlined
   herein.  The terms 'registration document' and 'registration' refer
   to an Internet Draft proposing the IANA registration of a ordinary
   Enumservice as defined in [2].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Required Sections and Information

   An x-registration document for an X-Enumservice is similar to a
   ordinary Enumservice registration as described in Guide and Template
   for IANA Registrations of Enumservices [2] except for the following:

   o  Enumservice Name:

         The Enumservice Name MUST contain the prefix "X-".

         e.g.  "X-Foo"

Internet-Draft         X-Enumservice Registrations              Nov 2007


   o  Enumservice Type:

         The Type MUST be prefixed with "x-".  To avoid confusion a name
         SHOULD be equal to type (but in lower case).

         e.g. "x-foo"

   o  URI Schemes:

         The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [8] Schemes, which are
         used with an X-Enumservice do not necessarily need to be
         documented in an IETF document.  If a publicly referenceable
         document is available it MUST be referenced in the
         x-registration document.  In case there is no publicly
         referenceable document, the URI Scheme MUST be sufficiently
         described in the x-registration document.

   o  Functional Specification:

         This section quite depends on how much publicly available
         documentation about the service already exists.

   o  Intended Usage:

         For the Intended Usage RFC 3761 [3] is extended with
         "EXPERIMENTAL", "PRIVATE", and "TRIAL".  One of those is to be
         used.

         e.g.  "TRIAL"


4.  The Process of Registering New X-Enumservices

   This section describes the process by which someone shall submit a
   new X-Enumservice for review and comment, how such proposed
   X-Enumservices shall be reviewed, and how x-registrations shall be
   published.

   Figure 1 and Figure 2 depict an overview on the X-Enumservice
   registration process.  Figure 1 describes, what an author of an I-D
   describing an X-Enumservice has to carry out, before he can formally
   submit said I-D for publication.  Figure 2 describes what happens
   afterwards including the expert review:

4.1.  Step 1: Read This Document In Detail

   This document and the specification for ordinary Enumservice
   registrations [2] describe all of the necessary sections required and
   recommended, makes suggestions on content, and provides sample XML.

4.2.  Step 2: Submit An Internet-Draft

   An Internet-Draft containing the x-registration shall be submitted in
   accordance with RFC 2026 [5] and RFC 2223bis [6], as well as RFC 3761
   [3], and any other documents applicable to the Internet-Draft
   process.  This Internet-Draft shall be submitted as an "Individual
   Submission".

4.3.  Step 3: Request Comments from the IETF Community

   After the Internet-Draft has been published, the author(s) shall send
   an email to <enum@ietf.org>, in which comments on said Internet-Draft
   are requested.

   Suggested Format of Announcement:

      To: enum@ietf.org
      Subject: Comments on <I-D Name Here>

      The author is requesting comments and feedback from the ENUM and
      IETF communities on the I-D listed below.

      The I-D is available at: <INSERT URL to I-D ON IETF WEB SITE HERE>

      Abstract of the I-D:
      <INSERT I-D ABSTRACT HERE>

   The author(s) should allow a reasonable period of time to elapse,
   such as two to four weeks, in order to collect any feedback.  The
   author(s) shall then consider whether or not to take any of those
   comments into account, by making changes to the Internet-Draft and
   submitting a revision to the I-D editor, or otherwise proceeding.
   The following outcomes are the ways the author(s) shall proceed, and
   it is up to the authors' judgement as to which one to choose.

4.3.1.  Outcome 1: No Changes Needed

   No changes to the Internet-Draft are made, and the author(s)
   proceed(s) to Step 4 below.

   This outcome is recommended when the feedback received does not lead
   to a new revision of the Internet-Draft.

4.3.2.  Outcome 2: Changes, but no Further Comments Requested

   The author(s) update(s) the Internet-Draft and is/are confident that
   all issues are resolved and do not require further discussion.  The
   author(s) proceed(s) to Step 4 below.

   This outcome is recommended when minor objections have been raised,
   or minor changes have been suggested.

4.3.3.  Outcome 3: Changes and Further Comments Requested

   The author(s) update(s) the Internet-Draft, and proceed(s) to Step 3
   above, which involves sending another email to <enum@ietf.org> to

Internet-Draft         X-Enumservice Registrations              Nov 2007


   request additional comments for the updated version.

   This outcome is recommended when substantial objections have been
   raised, or substantial changes have been suggested.

4.4.  Step 4: Submit I-D for Publication

   The author(s) submit the Internet-Draft containing the x-registration
   to be published as an RFC.  The IETF publication process includes
   IANA actions such as adding the service to the IANA X-Enumservice
   registry.  It is RECOMMENDED that an X-Enumservice registration is
   published as either a Informational, or Experimental RFC.

   However, if the author insists to publish an X-Enumservice
   registration as Standards Track or Best Current Practice (BCP), the
   process for ordinary Enumservice registrations [2] applies, which
   means apart from the "X-" prefix there is no difference to an
   ordinary Enumservice registration.


5.  Expert Review

   A new X-Enumservice MUST undergo expert review before publication and
   is initiated by IANA before a new X-Enumservice added to the IANA
   registry.  Expert review for X-Enumservices is conducted the same way
   as defined for ordinary Enumservice registrations [2].  However, the
   barriers for approval are rather low compared to ordinary Enumservice
   registrations.

   Expert review for X-Enumservices for will include an initial
   evaluation of whether this specification will have issues in
   transferring to a Standards Track document (for example, if it uses
   an unregistered URL scheme, or that the security and privacy analysis
   is incomplete at this stage).  It will also indicate whether the use
   of this X-Enumservice will clash with any other (X-)Enumservices or
   cause damage to other compliant ENUM components, and should be used
   only in private configurations where all involved components are
   aware of its use.

   Expert reviews for X-Enumservices do not normally result in
   rejection, unless its use will cause serious negative impact to ENUM,
   DNS or the Internet.  However, authors SHOULD address issues raised
   during expert review in an update of the x-registration document,
   before a new X-Enumservice is added to the IANA registry.

   The results of such an expert review MUST be appended to the
   x-registration document and will be recorded along with the
   specification itself.

Internet-Draft         X-Enumservice Registrations              Nov 2007


5.1.  IANA initiates Expert Review

   IANA contacts an expert that conducts the expert review.  The
   X-Enumservice expert review process shall then be followed to
   conclusion.  The pool of experts is the same as for ordinary
   Enumservice registrations [2].

5.2.  Expert(s) Review(s) the Internet Draft

   The Experts review the X-Enumservice according to the guidelines in
   this Section 5.

5.2.1.  Outcome 1: Experts Approve X-Enumservice

   In this case, the proposed X-Enumservice has been endorsed and
   approved by the experts, and the Internet-Draft proceeds further.

5.2.2.  Outcome 2: Experts Raise Issues, Changes Required

   The experts raise issues that prevent approval of the proposed
   X-Enumservice.  If they believe that, with changes, the proposed
   X-Enumservice will be approved, then they may recommend that the
   author(s) make changes and submit a revised version that undergoes
   another review by the experts.

5.2.3.  Outcome 3: Experts Reject X-Enumservice

   The experts raise issues that result in rejection of the proposed
   X-Enumservice.  If they believe that, even with changes, the proposed
   X-Enumservice will not be approved, the process normally terminates.
   However, if the author(s) disagrees(s) with this judgement, he has
   the possibility to to appeal.  Appeals follow the common IETF appeal
   process as described in section 7 of [7] and section 6.5 of RFC 2026
   [5]

5.3.  Add Results of Expert Review

   The author(s) include(s) the results of the Expert review to the
   Internet-Draft containing the x-registration and submit the updated
   version.

5.4.  IANA inserts X-Enumservice to Registry

   IANA inserts the X-Enumservice to the corresponding Registry and the
   x-registration proceeds on its way to publication as RFC.

6.  Security Considerations

   Since this document does not introduce any technology or protocol,
   there are no security issues to be considered for this memo itself.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces three new strings for Intended Usage as
   defined in RFC 3761 [3].  These new strings are: "EXPERIMENTAL",
   "PRIVATE", and "TRIAL".  The revision of RFC 3761 [3] RFC3761bis [4]
   shall contain these new strings.  Furthermore the dash in the 'X-'
   string needs to be put into the set of allowed characters in an
   Enumservice Type.  In case the revision of RFC 3761 is not yet ready
   at publication time of this memo, an intermediary regime needs to be
   defined.

   An IANA Registry for X-Enumservices is to be defined.
