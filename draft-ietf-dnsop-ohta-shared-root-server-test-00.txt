Abstract

   This memo describes an environment to test a proposal to have root
   name servers with shared unicast addresses described in <draft-ietf-
   dnsop-ohta-shared-root-server-00txt>.

1. Introduction

   In [SRS], there is a proposal to have multiple name servers sharing
   unicast (anycast) addresses. The proposal is designed to work in
   intra domain environment with route registries by using multiple ASes
   sharing AS numbers.

   This memo describes an environment to test the proposal.

   While the proposal is on root domain using multiple unicast (anycast)
   addresses and (anycast) AS numbers, the experiment is on a real but
   non-root domain using only one unicast address and one AS number.

2. IP addresses

INTERNET DRAFT            Testing Name Servers                 July 2000


   A block of IP addresses:

      192.83.230/24

which is expected to be globally routable, is reserved for the test.

   The DNS servers share an IP address of:

      192.83.230.1

3. AS number

   AS 4128 is used for the test.

4. Domains

   The initial domains to be served by the DNS servers are:

      real-internet.org.
      psg.com.

   There may be additional domains tested.

5. Participants

   The initial participants of the test and globally unique unicast
   addresses of their servers are as follows:

      ???.???.???.???  Francisco Arias <farias@nic.mx>
      ???.???.???.???  Frederico A. C. Neves <fneves@ansp.br>
      131.112.32.131   Masataka Ohta <mohta@real-internet.org>
      ???.???.???.???  Randy Bush <randy@psg.com>
      ???.???.???.???  Stacy Smith <stacy@broadwing.net>

6. Mailing List

   If you are interested in joining (or just watching) the test, send a
   mail containing a single line of:

      subscribe aroot

   to

      majordomo@ops.ietf.org

   the mailing list is located at:

7. Contact

   If there is something wrong with route information from AS 4128, the
   author of the memo or the mailing list for the test may be contacted.

   However, for direct contact to the source of the problem, the contact
   person of an AS next to AS 4128 in the AS path of problematic route
   information should be contacted as described in [SRS].
