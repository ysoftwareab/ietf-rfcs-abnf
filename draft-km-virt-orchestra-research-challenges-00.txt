           Virtual Orchestra Usecase and Research Challenges
             draft-km-virt-orchestra-research-challenges-00

Abstract

   This document describes open research challenges for emerging media-
   oriented ensemble applications.  One such driving scenario is the
   network delivery of virtual orchestra that imposes multi-disciplinary
   challenges.  Specifically, of interest are the group communication
   patterns in the production, delivery and consumption as different
   dimensions relating to the communication networks.
   This document brings forth current research and engineering
   challenges in immersive media ensembles.  The network domain problems
   come down to the specification of coordination of the received
   content with dependency constraints.  The challenges depict both real
   and quasi- realtime behavior.  A number of endpoint actors get
   involved in delivering the ensemble aspect, the research challenges
   also describe the expectations from the end points.

1.  Introduction and Scope

   The multimedia segment has seen tremendous advancements in immersive
   multimedia technologies.  One of the ongoing research question is how
   to deliver a complete immersion experience of the digital media.
   Such media is produced from an ensemble of different actors or
   multiple sources that must coordinate as they perform together in the
   real environment.  It translates to generating a very high volume of
   generated data streams

   This memo presents research and engineering challenges in multi-user
   digital ensemble that need to be addressed in order to achieve these
   goals, spanning from pure research and engineering/standards space.
   The network related challenges are generalized as coordinated
   communications and explained as group communications with explicit
   dependencies.  The objective of this memo is to document the
   technical challenges and corresponding current approaches and to
   expose requirements that should be addressed by future research and
   standards work.

2.  Terminology

   *  Co-flows: Co dependent flows

   *  Coordinated service: A network capability to support
      communications between co-dependent flows

3.  Scenario Description

   In an orchestra ensemble the multimedia streams of musicians, each in
   a different place in the world come together and perform live on the
   stage which may also be at a different location.

   *  A conductor directs the sound of the ensemble with his gestures.
      These gestures must be received at the same time by the remote
      musicians at different locations to play their instruments at a
      specific time with a specified tempo.

   *  Similarly, the music transmitted from those musicians' locations
      to the stage must be played together with the same beats and
      tempo.  Any delay or early arrival of the sound from any one
      instrument can cause the ensemble to go out of tune and destroy
      the entire performance.

   Performing an ensemble with multiple participants separated by large
   as well as varying distances (from less than a mile, to 1000 miles)
   is quite difficult for applications due to varying path and latency
   characteristics.

   The network needs to support the coordination of directions from the
   conductor to all of the musicians and the audio/visuals from
   musicians to the stage.  In particular, in a large-scale ensemble
   when many instruments are involved, in order to to preserve the
   integrity of performance, it may be necessary to allow for the
   dropping of sound and hologram streams of a musician that cannot
   arrive at the same time as the others and to provide mechanisms for
   subsequent fast synchronization.

   Virtual orchestra is a complex multi-disciplinary use case and
   requires in-depth knowledge in every field to recreate the real
   orchestral experience.

             Figure 1: Virtual Orchestra Delivery over Network

3.1.  Multiple Streams and actors

   A virtual orchestra is a coordination of multiple flows as shown in
   Figure 1.  In the current network terminology this is equivalent to
   multicast group of a number of endpoints and requiring to meet
   cooperation between the endpoints on how to send and receive
   information.  An application point of view sees this as a membership
   to publish/subscribe topic.  In the above example, endpoint actors
   are the conductor, musicians and the stage.  The characteristics of
   traffic are predictable and the following steps take place

3.1.1.  Conductor to Musicians

   *  The conductor is initiator of the orchestral stream.  Synchronized
      reception of the gestures of a conductor are critical to the
      performance.

   *  Musicians perform on cues or gestures received over the network.
      It is necessary that all the musicians receive those cues to start
      the performance.

   *  The performance follows the tempo and beats from the conductor,
      which must be delivered in a consistent (jitter free) manner
      (incurring no jitter).

3.1.2.  Musicians to Stage

   Atleast one output stream per sources will be generated to create the
   ensemble performance, these sources may have variable latencies.
   They should be aggregated to be delivered to the stage as a unified
   stream.

   The two scenarios are one to many Section 3.1.1 and many to
   oneSection 3.1.2 type of group communication.  The coordination
   constraints involve several dependencies such as of synchronization
   at the start of play, maintenance of same tempo along the time scale
   throughout the streaming part, description of distance for spatial
   sound quality.

3.2.  Virtual Orchestra Scenario Challenges

   In this section we draw forth scenarios with difficulties in
   delivering virtual orchestra over the network.

   Note that virtual orchestra application itself maybe delivered in
   different ways.  Non-realtime scenarios are not relevant since, in
   that case it is a non-interactive content delivery, the content does
   not require aggregation from multiple sources.  An application and
   corresponding network can use buffering, low latency techniques and
   existing transport protocols to meet the expectations of an end-user.

   Specific to real-time streaming of virtual orchestra, the performance
   is pseudo-real-time.  It means that the synchronization of content
   originating from different sources is only as fast as its slowest
   path.  In other words, one source-destination path of the co-flow
   will cause the pace of the group stream to slow-down, even though the
   other, shorter latency paths may deliver content sooner.  This in a
   major co-dependency challenge, since the slowest path should not have
   any impact on the tempo and the beats.  Thus 3 dependency
   considerations for the network are: - Feasibility Dependency: Assess
   and determine that with the slowest flow-member of the group if such
   a flow is even feasible. - Membership Dependency (spatial): The
   mechanisms to establish and determine membership and establish
   relationship is needed.  Corelating to publisher (conductor and
   stage) and subscriber (performers) group communication model, not all
   subscribers need to know about each other. - Start Time Dependency
   (temporal): Each performer depends on the trigger to start from there
   on time-scale, tempo and beats of the performance must be preserved.

   From a logical architectural point of view, coordination node is a
   function that synchronizes all the incoming streams, it may then
   either deliver all the streams or as a single stream.

4.  Generlized Coordinated Service Concept

   There are several examples of multi-party immersive applications (TBD
   - add section) in which remote entities will be required to recreate
   the behavior of being present in the same scene or environment.
   Therefore, they are co-dependent on each other's spatio-temporal
   behavior changes.  For example, in an orchestra tempo or beats and
   gestures must remain the same for all performers and position of a
   musician is computed to create spatial audio.

   A generalized in-network capability is introduced that consumes group
   communication membership and constraints and delivers service with in
   the specified constriaints.

   Keeping in the network context, important terms and components of
   coordinated service are introduced as below:

                                        .-.
                                       (---)--->
                                        `-'---->
                                 .---.           +-----+
                                (     )----------|Co-EP|
                   member        `---'           +-----+
    +-----+      |  flow         Co-SN
    |Co-EP|----+ |                 ^^
    +-----+    | |                .||.
               | |               ( ||)        .-.
               | v                `||'   ----(--)---->
             .---.  -------->    .---.  -----`-'----->    +-----+
            (     )-------------(     )-------------------|Co-EP|
             `---'   ------->    `---'                    +-----+
   +-----+     |                 Co-SN
   |Co-EP|-----+
   +-----+ ------>   Co-EP: coordinated service end point
                     Co-SN: coordinated service node
                     Co-Flow: coordinated flow
                     Member flow: member of a co-flow

   *  Coordinated Service: A coordinated service provides guarantee of
      delivery of multiple flows in a dependent manner.  It is a type of
      group communication service supported by the network in which each
      member of the group has a dependency on other group-members.  A
      coordinated service should be able to coordinate delivery of co-
      flows over different categories of group communications.

   *  Coordinated Service end point (Co-EP): An endpoint in a group
      communication where in coordination of resources or constraints is
      required.

   *  Coordinated service Points (Co-SN): The mechanisms to support
      coordinated services in network requires new capabilities referred
      to as network coordination functions.  A service node is a part of
      the network that understands and processes network specific
      functions of coordination.

   *  Co-dependent Flow(Co-Flow): A set of flows that have dependencies
      in relation to eachother.  Each flow in the co-dependent flow set
      is referred to as a member-flow.  The co-flows may express
      different kinds of dependencies or relationships.  It may be point
      to mltipoint, multipoint to point or multipoint to multipoint.

   *  Member flow: A single point to point member flow of a co-flow.

   Coordinated services are a form of group comminication with a clearly
   expressed dependencies.  Possible approaches will figure out
   mechanisms to manage those dependencies.

5.  Virtual Orchestra Coordination Challenges

   The internet is a spatial-temporal heterogeneous environment,
   yielding different content delivery behaviours in time and space.  No
   two paths (or even different flows on the same path) can be assumed
   to have identical properties in terms of latency, jitter, and
   bandwidth.

   Currently, any effort to support virtual orchestra in the networks is
   not feasible.  Managing flow dependencis entirely by the applications
   on endpoints does not always guarantee absolute time constraints due
   to unpredictable changes in network conditions.  This necessitates
   some kind of coordination with the network.

5.1.  Out-of-band Coordination

   The out-of-band coordination may be used to achieve distribution of
   coflows in the network.  The membership of co-dependent flows is
   conveyed from the end-points potentially when the flows are set up,
   so that the coarse-grained service (and service level objectives) can
   be enabled in the network.  A distribution graph of coflows and
   associated dependency constraints may be constructed, and those nodes
   enhance their scheduling and forwarding by factoring in the timing
   information in the meta-data of packets.

5.2.  In-band Coordination

   Then timestamping of transmission from sender delivery to receiver
   may be conveyed as meta-data in packets transmitted from the senders.
   This type of In-band signaling conveys intermediate coordination
   points about the dependencies and interrelationship.  To formalize
   these mechanisms to carry them in data path.

5.3.  In-node Coordinated-forwarding

   Actual coordination effort is done on the coordination points.  The
   scheduling and forwarding engine should allow packets within sync
   markers to be sent as per remaining &#948;t.  It needs to compare the
   remaining coordination time and accordingly schedule or pace the
   packet forwarding.
