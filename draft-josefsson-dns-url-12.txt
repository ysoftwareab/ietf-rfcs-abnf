Internet-Draft                   DNS URI                        May 2005


1.  Introduction and Background

   The Domain Name System (DNS) [1] [2] is a widely deployed system used
   to, among other things, translate host names into IP addresses.
   Recent work has added support for storing certificates and
   certificate revocation lists (CRLs) in the DNS [9].  Several
   protocols use Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to point at
   certificates and CRLs.  By defining a Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) scheme for DNS resources, such protocols can reference
   certificates and CRLs stored in the DNS.

   Two examples of data structures that may embed DNS URIs:

   o  The OpenPGP Message Format [7], where an end-user may indicate the
      location of a copy of any updates to her key, using the "preferred
      key server" field.

   o  The Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure [14] format, where
      the issuer may use a DNS URI in a CRL Distribution Point
      certificate extension field.

   The DNS URI scheme defined here can be used to reference any data
   stored in the DNS, and is not limited to certificates or CRLs.  The
   purpose of this specification is to define a generic DNS URI, not to
   specify a solution only for certificates stored in the DNS.

   Data browsers may support DNS URIs by forming DNS queries and render
   DNS responses using HTML [13], similar to what is commonly done for
   FTP [6] resources.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

Internet-Draft                   DNS URI                        May 2005


2.  Usage Model

   The reader is referred to section 1 of [5] for an in-depth discussion
   of URI classifications.  In particular, the reader is assumed to be
   familiar with the "name" vs "locator" distinction.  This section
   describe how the DNS URI scheme is intended to be used, and outline
   future work that may be required to use URIs with the DNS for some
   applications.

   The URI scheme described in this document focus on the data stored in
   the DNS.  As such, there is no provision to specify any of the fields
   in the actual DNS protocol.  This is intentional, so that the URI may
   be used even in situations where the DNS protocol is not used
   directly.  Two examples for this is zone file editors and DNS-related
   configuration files, which may use this URI scheme to identify data.
   The application would not use the DNS protocol to resolve the URIs.

   A limitation of this design is that it do not accommodate all
   protocol parameters within the DNS protocol.  It is expected that for
   certain applications, a more detailed URI syntax that map more
   closely to the DNS protocol may be required.  However, such an URI
   definition is not included in this document.  This document specify a
   URI that is primarily intended to name DNS resources, but it can also
   be used to locate said resources for simple (but common)
   applications.

3.  DNS URI Registration

   The section contain the registration template for the DNS URI scheme
   in accordance with [12].

   URL scheme name: "dns".

   URL scheme syntax: A DNS URI designate a DNS resource record set,
   referenced by domain name, class, type and optionally the authority.
   The DNS URI follows the generic syntax from RFC 3986 [5], and is
   described using ABNF [4].  Strings are not case sensitive and free
   insertion of linear-white-space is not permitted.

   dnsurl          = "dns:" [ "//" dnsauthority "/" ]
                     dnsname ["?" dnsquery]

   dnsauthority    = host [ ":" port ]
                                ; See RFC 3986 for the
                                ; definition of "host" and "port".

   dnsname         = *pchar
                                ; See RFC 3986 for the
                                ; definition of "pchar".

                                ; The "dnsname" field may be a
                                ; "relative" or "absolute" name,
                                ; as per RFC 1034 section 3.1.

                                ; Note further that an empty
                                ; "dnsname" value is to be
                                ; interpreted as the root itself.
                                ; See below on relative dnsname's.

   dnsquery        = dnsqueryelement [";" dnsquery]

   dnsqueryelement = ( "CLASS=" dnsclassval ) / ( "TYPE=" dnstypeval )
                                ; Each clause MUST NOT be used more
                                ; than once.

   dnsclassval     = 1*digit / "IN" / "CH" /
                     <Any IANA registered DNS class mnemonic>

   dnstypeval      = 1*digit / "A" / "NS" / "MD" /
                     <Any IANA registered DNS type mnemonic>

   Unless specified in the URI, the authority ("dnsauthority") is
   assumed to be locally known, the class ("dnsclassval") to be the
   Internet class ("IN"), and the type ("dnstypeval") to be the Address

   type ("A").  These default values match the typical use of DNS; to
   look up addresses for host names.

   A dnsquery element MUST NOT contain more than one occurance of the
   "CLASS" and "TYPE" fields.  For example, both "dns:
   example?TYPE=A;TYPE=TXT" and "dns:example?TYPE=A;TYPE=A" are invalid.
   However, the fields may occur in any order, so that both "dns:
   example?TYPE=A;CLASS=IN" and "dns:example?CLASS=IN;TYPE=A" are valid.

   The digit representation of types and classes MAY be used when a
   mnemonic for the corresponding value is not well known (e.g., for
   newly introduced types or classes), but SHOULD NOT be used for the
   types or classes defined in the DNS specification [2].  All
   implementations MUST recognize the mnemonics defined in [2].

   To avoid ambiguity, relative "dnsname" values (i.e., those not ending
   with ".") are assumed to be relative to the root.  For example, "dns:
   host.example" and "dns:host.example." both refer to the same owner
   name, namely "host.example.".  Further, an empty "dnsname" value is
   considered to be a degenerative form of a relative name, which refer
   to the root (".").

   To resolve a DNS URI using the DNS protocol [2] a query is created,
   using as input the dnsname, dnsclassval and dnstypeval from the URI
   string (or the appropriate default values).  If an authority
   ("dnsauthority") is given in the URI string, this indicate the server
   that should receive the DNS query, otherwise the default DNS server
   should receive it.

   Note that DNS URIs could be resolved by other protocols than the DNS
   protocol, or by using the DNS protocol in some other way than as
   described above (e.g., multicast DNS).  DNS URIs do not require the
   use of the DNS protocol, although it is expected to be the typical
   usage.  The previous paragraph only illustrate how DNS URIs are
   resolved using the DNS protocol.

   A client MAY want to check that it understands the dnsclassval and
   dnstypeval before sending a query, so that it will be able to
   understand the response.  However, a typical example of a client that
   would not need to check dnsclassval and dnstypeval would be a proxy,
   that would just treat the received answer as opaque data.

   Character encoding considerations: The characters are encoded as per
   RFC 3986 [5].  The DNS protocol do not consider character sets, it
   simply transports opaque data.  In particular, the "dnsname" field of
   the DNS URI is to be considered an internationalized domain name
   (IDN) unaware domain name slot, in the terminology of [16].  The
   considerations for "host" and "port" are discussed in [5]

   Because "." is used as the DNS label separator, an escaping mechanism
   is required to encode a "." that is part of a DNS label.  The
   escaping mechanism is described in section 5.1 of RFC 1035.  For
   example, a DNS label of "exa.mple" can be escaped as "exa\.mple" or
   "exa\046mple".  However, the URI specification disallow the "\"
   character from occuring directly in URIs, so it must be escaped as
   "%5c".  The single DNS label "exa.mple" is thus encoded as "exa%
   5c.mple".  The same mechanism can be used to encode other characters,
   for example "?" and ";".  Note that "." and "%2e" are equivalent
   within dnsname, and are interchangable.

   This URI specification allows all possible domain names to be encoded
   (of course following the encoding rules of [5]), however certain
   applications may restrict the set of valid characters.  Care should
   be taken so that invalid characters in these contexts does not cause
   harm.  In particular, host names in the DNS have certain
   restrictions.  It is up to these application to limit this subset,
   this URI scheme places no restrictions.

   Intended usage: Whenever DNS resources are useful to reference by
   protocol independent identifiers, often when the data is more
   important than the access method.  Since software in general has
   coped without this so far, it is not anticipated to be implemented
   widely, nor migrated to by existing systems, but specific solutions
   (especially security related) may find this appropriate.

   Applications and/or protocols which use this scheme: Security related
   software.  DNS administration tools.  Network programming packages.

   Interoperability considerations: The data referenced by this URI
   scheme might be transferred by protocols that are not URI aware (such
   as the DNS protocol).  This is not anticipated to have any serious
   interoperability impact though.

   Interoperability problems may occur if one entity understands a new
   DNS class/type mnemonic and another entity do not understand it.
   This is an interoperability problem for DNS software in general,
   although it is not a major practical problem as the DNS types and
   classes are fairly static.  To guarantee interoperability
   implementations can use integers for all mnemonics not defined in
   [2].

   Interaction with Binary Labels [11], or other extended label types,
   has not been analyzed.  However, they appear to be infrequently used
   in practice.

4.  Examples

   A DNS URI is of the following general form.  This is intended to
   illustrate, not define, the scheme.

   dns:[//authority/]domain[?CLASS=class;TYPE=type]

   The following illustrate a URI for a resource with the absolute name
   "www.example.org.", the Internet (IN) class and the Address (A) type:

   dns:www.example.org.?clAsS=IN;tYpE=A

   Since the default class is IN, and the default type is A, the same
   resource can be identified by a shorter URI, using a relative name:

   dns:www.example.org

   The following illustrate a URI for a resource with the name
   "simon.example.org", for the CERT type, in the Internet (IN) class:

   dns:simon.example.org?type=CERT

   The following illustrate a URI for a resource with the name
   "ftp.example.org", in the Internet (IN) class and the address (A)
   type, but from the DNS authority 192.168.1.1 instead of the default
   authority:

   dns://192.168.1.1/ftp.example.org?type=A

   The following illustrate various escaping techniques.  The owner name
   would be "world wide web.example\.domain.org" where "\." denote the
   character "." as part of a label, and "." denote the label separator:

   dns:world%20wide%20web.example%5c.domain.example?TYPE=TXT

   The following illustrate a strange, but valid, DNS resource:

   dns://fw.example.org/*.%20%00.example?type=TXT

   Laboratories for supporting the work that led to this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   If a DNS URI references domains in the Internet DNS environment, both
   the URI itself and the information referenced by the URI is public
   information.  If a DNS URI is used within an "internal" DNS
   environment, both the DNS URI and the data is referenced should be
   handled using the same considerations that apply to DNS data in the
   environment.

   If information referenced by DNS URIs are used to make security
   decisions (examples of such data include, but is not limited to,
   certificates stored in the DNS), implementations may need to employ
   security techniques such as Secure DNS [8], or even CMS [15] or
   OpenPGP [7], to protect the data during transport.  How to implement
   this will depend on the usage scenario, and it is not up to this URI
   scheme to define how the data referenced by DNS URIs should be
   protected.

   If applications accept unknown dnsqueryelement values (e.g., accepts
   the URI "dns:www.example.org?secret=value" without knowing what the
   "secret=value" dnsqueryelement means), a covert channel used to
   "leak" information may be enabled.  The implications of covert
   channels should be understood by applications that accepts unknown
   dnsqueryelement values.

   Slight variations, such as difference between upper and lower case in
   the dnsname field, can be used as a covert channel to leak
   information.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is asked to register the DNS URI scheme, using the template
   in section 3, in accordance with RFC 2717 [12].

   Modifications derived from Last-Call comments: Made more clear that
   DNS URIs does not imply use of the DNS protocol, but the issue is not
   stressed because of the apparent inflamatory state of affairs.  Added
   informative references to HTML and FTP.  Clarified that dnsname can
   be empty.  Clarified that first dnsqueryelement "win" in case of
   ambiguity.  Clarified security consideration with respect to unknown
   dnsqueryelements.  Use "authority" instead of "server".  Say "IANA
   registered" instead of "standard".  Interoperability note about
   binary DNS labels.  Typos.

A.4  Changes since -09

   Use legal texts from RFC 3667.  Update UTF-8 reference to RFC 3629.
   Simplified introduction.  Discuss relative and absolute dnsname's.
   Clarify that empty dnsname correspond to the root.  Change so that
   dns:foo?TYPE=A;TYPE=TXT is invalid, instead of meaning TYPE=A. The
   underspecified extension mechanism was dropped; now only TYPE= and
   CLASS= are permitted.  Remove background discussion of why the
   dnsname field is made a IDN unaware domain name slot.  Use standard
   DNS escaping (i.e, "\." for ".") instead of broken approach that
   violated the URI specification.  Improve examples.  Add security
   considerations.

A.5  Changes since -10

   Add section "Usage Model".  Move acknowledgements, as per rfc2223bis.
   Add permissive copying condition.  Updates to align with RFC 3986.

A.6  Changes since -11

   Fix typos.  IESG feedback: Move RFC2119 reference to normative
   section.  Replace OCSP example with X.509 CRL Distribution Point
   extension.  Fix ABNF not to use "...".
