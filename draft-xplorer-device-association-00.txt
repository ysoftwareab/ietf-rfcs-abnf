3. General Information of the service
	

      For the user who just want emails and not net savvy, He or she has to be able
to walk into a store and get a device like android smart phone and associate his or her
 unique name with that smart phone. The buyer should also be to map his phone number to unique name.
I should be able to type phone number or Unique name in the to field of email and get it delivered
to the device that has the phone number or device MAC Address.

As an example My Unique name is Pradeep Kumar Xplorer Califorina that i  have chosen to use.
WHen i buy a device i should be able to map the device MAC address of that device to that Unique
name. If it is not available i have to chose a different name.

Some one in their sixties or sevneties most probably are not internet web savvy. He or
she may not want or know how to install an Application like MailDroid and setup Imap
settings. They just need to type the Unique name of the person they want to send message
to send emails.This prevents hidden cost of signing up for a servive provider like gmail.com
or hotmail.com and also protects privacy by not having their messages on some remote servers.

This increases usability. This with restrictions on functions to a device 
by using some programming like https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-pradeep-kumar-xplorer-posvm/
to allow a device to be used only for emails can make emails usable to a wider
audience who are not computer savvy.

I am victim of a very serious cybercrime as a yoga guide for last 15 years i created and published
 as self employed in individual capacity a website with some unique intellectual property. I do not know who
is accessing my website. I added some software scripts to print the IP address and location of
the viewers of my website. The crime is that some others know who my website viewers are lying
about me and running an organisation company in black by contacting them. These are the logs
http://www.pradeepkumarxplorer.com/2016/vieweremails.txt
Instead of IP address if i get the device MAC or Unique name then i can send them an email
and have a channel to communicate to them directly.
