Internet-Draft        LCAF BGP Extended Communities         January 2017


1.  Introduction

   This memo proposes a LCAF type for BGP Extended Communities.

2.  BGP Extended Communities Attribute

   When a BGP Extended Community [RFC4360] is stored in the LISP Mapping
   Database System for either policy or documentation reasons, it can be
   encoded in a LISP Canonical Address as follows.

       0                   1                   2                   3

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document instructs the IANA to assign a LISP LCAF Type value to
   use as type for the proposed encoding [I-D.ietf-lisp-lcaf] (replacing
   the XX value in Figure 1).

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this Internet Draft.
