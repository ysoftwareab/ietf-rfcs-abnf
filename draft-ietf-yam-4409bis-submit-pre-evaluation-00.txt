Internet-Draft           YAM 4409bis Evaluation                June 2010


1.  Introduction

   A preliminary evaluation has been made of RFC 4409 "Message
   Submission for Mail" by the Yet Another Mail (YAM) Working Group for
   advancing it from Draft to Full Standard.  The YAM WG requests
   feedback from the IESG on this decision.

1.1.  Note to RFC Editor

   This Internet-Draft is not meant to be published as an RFC.  It is
   written to facilitate processing within the IESG.


2.  Preliminary Evaluation

2.1.  Document

   Title:   Message Submission for Mail

   Link:   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4409

2.2.  Time in Place

   RFC2026:   _"A specification shall remain at the Draft Standard level
      for at least four (4) months, or until at least one IETF meeting
      has occurred."_

   Published:   April 2006

2.3.  Implementation and Operational Experience

   RFC2026:   _"significant implementation and successful operational
      experience ... characterized by a high degree of technical
      maturity and by a generally held belief that the specified
      protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet
      community."_

   Confidence level:  Very high.

   Message Submission on port 587 has seen significant deployment over
   the past 8-10 years, becoming widespread in the past 2-3 years.
   There are several reasons for this, such as decisions by many ISPs
   and organizations in general to block outbound port 25 (except by
   their own border MTAs), and consequently to support 587 with
   authentication, as well as recognition of the need to apply different
   policies to submission and relay.

Internet-Draft           YAM 4409bis Evaluation                June 2010


2.4.  Proposed Changes

   The YAM WG proposes making the following changes in a revision:

   Client behavioral differences:  Submission clients behave differently
      from relay client in some areas, especially tolerance for time-
      outs.  In practice, message submission clients tend to have short
      time-outs (perhaps 2-5 minutes for a reply to any command) while
      relay clients are required to have per-command timeouts of as much
      as 10 minutes).  The document should describe this, and perhaps
      say that submission servers SHOULD respond to any command (even
      DATA) in fewer than 2 minutes.

   Technical errata: NO-SOLICITING  Per
      http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=4409, the
      reference for [NO-SOLICITING] is incorrect and needs to be fixed
      to be RFC 3865.

   Technical errata: Additional SMTP extensions  Per request reported at
      http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=4409, the
      following RFC extensions which do not themselves specify their
      validity for Submission should be added to the table in Section 7:

         RFC 2645 -- ATRN -- MUST NOT

         RFC 2852 -- DELIVERBY -- MAY

         RFC 4141 -- CONPERM, CONNEG -- MAY

      Note that other subsequently-published extensions, such as
      UTF8SMTP and BURL, do specify their validity and hence don't need
      to be included.

   Technical errata: References

         Per request reported at
         http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=4409, the
         [ESMTP] and [SMTP-MTA] references should be updated.
         Accordingly, [ESMTP]'s STD 10 should refer to RFC 5321-bis
         instead of both RFC 1869 and RFC 821.

         The reference to RFC 974 should be deleted as the relevant
         material is included in 5321.

         Likewise, the reference to STD 3, RFC 1123 should also be
         deleted from both [SMTP-MTA] and [MESSAGE-FORMAT] as its
         relevant material is also in RFC 5321.

Internet-Draft           YAM 4409bis Evaluation                June 2010


   Updated references:  SMTP AUTH should be RFC 4954 instead of 2554.
      This is a downref.  Note that the current RFC 4409 lists 2554 as
      an Informative, not Normative reference, even though AUTH is a
      MUST.

      Likewise, IPSec should be RFC 4301.

2.5.  Non-Changes

   The YAM WG discussed and chose not to make the following changes:

   1.  [[[ No non-changes have been proposed (nor discussed) ]]]

2.6.  Downward references

   At Full Standard, the following references would be downward
   references:

      SMTP AUTH (RFC 4954)

2.7.  IESG Feedback

   The YAM WG requests feedback from the IESG on this decision.  In
   particular:

   o  Does the IESG believe the proposed changes are suitable during a
      move from Draft to Full Standard?

   o  Excluding the previous proposed changes and expected IESG support
      for technically substantive IETF last call feedback, does the IESG
      believe any additional changes are critical to advance this
      document from draft to full standard?  If so, please provide
      sufficient information so the WG can address these issues prior to
      IETF last call or determine that the document is inappropriate for
      the YAM WG to process at this time.

   o  Does the IESG consider the downward references acceptable for a
      full standard?  If not, please cite which specific downward
      reference or references are problematic and why so the WG can
      address these issues prior to IETF last call or determine the
      document is inappropriate for the YAM WG to process at this time.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no IANA actions.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document requests IESG feedback and does not raise any security
   concerns.  Security considerations for RFC 4409 have been taken into
   account during the preliminary evaluation and appear in either
   Section 2.4 or Section 2.5 of this document.
