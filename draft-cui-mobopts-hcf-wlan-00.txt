Internet-Draft        HCF Based Handover for MIPv6             July 2005


1.  Introduction

   There are many proposals trying to give the solution for Mobile IPv6
   deployment for Wireless LAN network.  Especially there are some
   nationwide Wireless LAN network for the universities and research
   institutes, they would like to deploy VoIP and Video Telephone based
   on Mobile IPv6.  One important issue is that they can not modify
   current Access Routers to support Fast handover even just small part
   of Access Routers.  In order to considering VoIP and Video Telephone,
   the performance of fast handover have to be achieved.

   This document propose a scheme to support MIP6 deployment based on
   Wireless LAN by extending HMIPv6.  The HCF (Handover Control
   Function) described in this document should record all APs's MAC
   address, backend AR's address and network prefix of those APs.  All
   MNs will periodically report all AP's MAC address and signal strength
   information to HCF which MN can probe, then HCF should decide whether
   or which AP MN shall associate with and notify MN about the new AP/
   AR's information, meanwhile, a bi-cast mechanism shall be applied to
   further improve handover performance by reducing the packet loss
   during handover.

   Before MN handover the new AP/AR, HCF shall notify MN about the new
   AP/AR's information such as AP's MAC address, AR interface address,
   and network prefix.  Then, MN will configure its new CoA before
   moving to the new AP.  After handover, Layer 2 trigger may be used to
   support the handover.  This protocol defines two mobility options to
   support communication between MN and HCF.

   Since HCF decide which AR's interface MN will move to, so the new
   network prefix of MN will be notified by HCF through HCFRep message.
   If MN's address is computed using interface indentifier, like EUI64,
   Duplicated Address Detection can be omitted during handover.
   Furthermore, recent study reveals that DAD is not _applicable_ to
   Wireless LAN environment.  Therefore, In this protocol, HCF will know
   MN's new CoA according to MN's old CoA and MN's new network prefix.
   Under this situation, a bi-casting mechanism can also be applied to
   further improve handover performance.  HCF will act as a extention of
   MAP in HMIPv6 which shall begin to bi-cast to both MN's old CoA and
   new CoA after sending HCFRep to MN in order to reduce packet loss
   during handover.

   This protocol can be used in the nationwide university Wireless LAN
   based MIP6 network deployment to support VoIP and Video Telephony.

2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

   In addition, new terms are defined below::

   Home Agent (HA) A router on a MN's home link with which the MN has
   registered its current Care-of address.  While the MN is away from
   home, the HA intercepts packets on the home link destined to the MN's
   home address, encapsulates them, and tunnels them to the MN's
   registered Care-of address.

   Handover Control Function (HCF)

      A extension of MAP in HMIPv6 which should record all APs's MAC
      address, backend AR's address and network prefix of those APs.
      HCF should decide whether or which AP MN shall associate with and
      notify MN about the new AP/AR's information.  Meanwhile, HCF shall
      split a bi-cast stream to both MN's new CoA and old CoA.

   Mobile Node (MN)

      A node that can change its point of attachment from one link to
      another, while still being reachable via its home address.

   Access Point (AP)

      A Layer 2 device connected to an IP subnet that offers wireless
      connectivity to a MN.  An Access Point Identifier (AP-ID) refers
      the AP's L2 address.  Sometimes, AP-ID is also referred to as a
      Base Station Subsystem ID (BSSID).

   Access Router (AR)

      The MN's default router

   Handover

      A process of terminating existing connectivity and obtaining new
      IP connectivity.

   Bicasting

      The splitting of a stream of packets destined for a MN via its
      current HCF(the MAP) into two streams, and the simultaneous
      transmission of thestreams to old CoA and new CoA.

   Figure 1: Network Scenario of HCF based handover

   In this network scenario, there might one AR will connect to multiple
   APs, those APs might have same network prefix or different network
   prefix.

   When MN move from AP2 to AP3, the attached Access Router also change
   from AR1 to AR2 as well.  HCF will has administrative network domain,
   which can cover many ARs and APs.

   There are some network deployment scenarios such as University.
   There are might have one or multiple HCF in one university.  If there
   are more than one HCF in each university, the inter-connection
   between different HCF will be out of the scope of this document.

   Figure 2: Protocol for HCF based handover

   1.  When MN register to HA first time, it will send Bingding Update
       message to HA, and HA will response with Binding Acknowledgement.

   2.  After MN probes all Neighbor AP's information, and MinWlanTime is
       up, MN shall send HCFReq message directly to HCF to report the
       information of its neighbor AP.

   3.  After HCF receive the MAPReq message, it will decide whether or
       which AR/AP MN shall associate with.

   4.  Detail algorithm for HCF judgement of MN handover mostly is based
       on the signal strenth MN received from neighbor APs and HCF's
       network administraing policy.

   5.  HCF judge MN in some sense which also can help load balance among
       different ARs and APs, if the number of registered MNs in one AR
       or AP have over more than the threshold, HCF will not approve MN
       move to that network.

   6.  After HCF make decision which AR/AP MN will move to, HCF will
       notify MN about new AR/AP's information such as link prefix and

       AR's address.  Those information will help MN make a new CoA
       before it handover.  This address also has been known by HCF
       since new CoA is made based on EUI-64.

   7.  After MN receive the HCFReq message, it knows which AR/AP it will
       associate with and will configure its new CoA based on HCFReq
       message information about new AP/AR.

   8.  When MN moves from AP2 to AP3, the attached Access Router also
       change from AR1 to AR2.  MN will intensively deassociate with AP2
       and associate with AP3.

   9.  HCF works as an extension of MAP, and will send bicast traffic
       from HCF to both MN's old CoA and new CoA.  Once MN attach AP3/
       AR2, those traffic will go directly to MN's new CoA.  After
       receving the new binding update from new CoA, HCF will remove
       traffic going to old coA.


4.1  Mobile Node Operation

   Mobile Node will periodically report all neighbor's AP information to
   HCF by using HCFReq message, and modify its configuration based on
   informaiton transferred by HCFRep message.  And also Mobile Node
   shall support layer 2 trigger and optimized DAD to support fast
   handover.

4.2  Handover Control Function Operation

   HCF should collect all AP's MAC address, and AR's address and network
   prefix et al.  It can be done by network administrators manualy or
   other solution which is out the scope of this protocol.  HCF create a
   database inside or using LDAP to record those information in other
   network entities.

   HCF will decide whether which AP/AR MN will associate with, and will
   notify the related information of next AR/AP to MN.

   HCF will be responsible for authenticate and authorize the MN in
   order to reduce signal burdern in the access network,

   The HCF acts as a extension of MAP in hierarchical Mobile IPv6, it
   will bicast the traffic from CN to both old CoA and new CoA.

4.3  Home Agent Operation

   Home agent will work as Mobile IPv6 specificaiton, it will also
   accept the registration from HCF as a extension of MAP in HMIPv6.

4.4  Access Router Operation

   There are no specific security association requirement between MN and
   AR, which shall save signal overhead in the access network side.
   Meanwhile there exist some scenario, for example, in the university
   network, access routers are not expected to do any authentication.

4.5  Correspondent Node Operation

   Correspondent Node will work as Mobile IPv6 specification.

5.  Mobile IPv6 Extension

   MN will probe its neighor all AP's information and send these
   information to HCF using HCFReq message.  HCF will select an AP based
   on those information together with AR's information, and respond a
   HCFRep message including the MAC address of suggested AP along with
   some backend AR's information in that link, like network prefix and
   router address.

   HCF is an indenpendent entity as MAP in HMIPv6.  Messages between HCF
   and MN are introduced above as HCFReq and HCFRep.  These two messages
   are implemented here as an extension to Mobile IPv6, the format of
   two new Mobility Messagesare defined as following:

5.1  HCFReq message

   The HCF Request message uses the MH Type value MH_HCFREQ_TYPE.  When
   this value is indicated in the MH Type field, the format of the
   Message Data field in the Mobility Header is as follows:


                                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      level of AP suggested by HCF.

   Prefix Length

      A 8-bits unsigned integer.  The value of this field MUST NOT be
      more than 128, therefore the first bit of this field MUST be 0.
      This is prefix lenth of access router on the same link with the

6.  HCF Bicast Traffic

   Here HCF work as a extension of MAP in HMIPv6.  After HCF send out
   HCFRep message, it will trigger MAP to Bi-cast traffic for the MN for
   a short period to its current location and to new location where HCF
   suggest MN moving to shortly.

   HCF Bicasting traffic also removes the timing ambiguity regarding
   when to start sending traffic for the MN to its new point of
   attachment followng a Fast Handover.  It also saves the MN periods of
   service disruption in the case of ping-pong movement.

   Here we refer to the Bi-cast/N-cast draft [7] lifetime mechanism, the
   HCF MUST create a new binding cache sub-entry (linked to the original
   entry for the old CoA) for the MN's new CoA.  This sub-entry contains
   the same fields as normal binding cache entries but it MUST not
   replace any existing entries for the MN.  The new sub-entry will have
   two lifetimes instead of one: the normal new CoA BU lifetime (sent in
   the BA) and a Bicasting lifetime set to SHORT_BINDING_LIFETIME (sent
   in the BA sub-option).  The new CoA lifetime runs in parallel with
   the Bicasting lifetime.  Until the Bicasting lifetime expires, the
   HCF MUST send a copy of the data destined for the MN to the old CoA
   and to the new CoA in the linked binding cache sub-entry or sub-
   entries.  When the Bicasting lifetime expires, the HCF MUST remove
   the bicasting lifetime field and replace the old binding cache entry
   for the old CoA with the new CoA sub-entry.  As a result, the HCF
   will end up with one entry for the MN's new CoA with the remaining
   new CoA lifetime.

   The default value for SHORT_BINDING_LIFETIME is 2s.  This parameter
   MUST be configurable as it my vary depending on the type of radio
   link in the system.

   After HCF received BU from new CoA, old CoA binding is deleted, and
   new CoA binding kept alive after that

   There are also two issues similar to [7]: 1.  Multiple copies of
   packets received at AR. 2.  Reception of multiple copies in the MN.

   In this version, Multiple-Casting has not yet been considered.  It
   will be analysized in the future.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA Registry for Mobile IPv6 Mobility
   Header Types.

   A new MH type MH_HCFREQ_TYPE is define in section 5.1 of this
   document to identify new HCFReq message in Mobile IPv6 protocol.

   A new MH type MH_HCFREP_TYPE is define in section 5.2 of this
   document to identify new HCFRep message in Mobile IPv6 protocol.

8.  Security Considerations

   HCF does not introduce any more security problems than Mobile IPv6
   and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6.  Same IPSec protection used in Mobile
   IPv6 signals MUST be used to protect two new messages, HCFReq,
   HCFRep, in this solution.

   All messages between MN and HCF MUST be authenticated.  This means
   that the mobile host has to share an authentication key (private or
   public) with all HCFs it may visit.  These keys can be pre-installed
   manually or obtained dynamically via IKE or AAA servers.

   Since HCF is an extension to Mobile Anchor Point in HMIPv6.  These
   authentication key SHOULD be the key between MN and MAP as specified
   in HMIPv6.
