Abstract

   This document describes conventions for using MIDI to generate tones
   on SIP UAs. This does not define any changes to SIP but describes how
   to use the existing Alert-Info header to play tones that can be used
   to indicate specialized PSTN tones such as the ringback tones from
   various countries. The tones are described using MIDI which results
   in a compact representation that is simple for a UA to generate and
   easy to render into audio.

1. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

2. Introduction

   Countries and regions within countries use different tones to
   represent information related to the state and progress of telephone
   calls. Different tones are generated to alert the user the phone is
   ready to make a call, is attempting to ring a remote party, that the
   remote party is busy, etc..  When placing a call to a remote party
   with the PSTN, the tones of the destination country are usually
   heard. Most work at the IETF today is intended to make sure the user
   interface experience of users is localized to the form they
   understand and prefer to use. This work is just the opposite, it
   provides a way to replicate the PSTN experience of phoning a foreign
   country and hearing tones you may not have heard before and have no
   way to understand.

   SIP telephones have traditionally generated these tones locally, and
   the tones heard are the same no matter where the called resides.
   While many people feel that this localized and familiar behavior is
   the correct behavior, there have been discussions of situations where
   it is desirable to maintain the behavior of the PSTN and reproduce
   the local tones of the destination.

   Additionally, there has been no standard way to encode the tones used
   in a particular country. As the reach of SIP endpoints increases,
   localization of these devices such that they exhibit correct behavior
   for the region in which they are installed has become increasingly
   important.

   This document presents a method to represent these tones using an
   existing standard, and presents a method for conveying this
   information using SIP.

3. Discussion

   The basic mechanism is for the UAS to indicate in a response the tone
   that it wants to have played by including the MIDI tone in the
   response message. The MIDI tone description is carried in the body of
   the SIP message and the Alert-Info header contains a cid URL that
   points at the body.

   The UAS can indicate in a SIP response, such as a 180, that it wishes
   a tone to be played by including a body with a MIDI tone and setting



Bryan & Jennings         Expires April 7, 2004                  [Page 3]

   the Alert-Info header to have a cid URL that points at the body. This
   would typically be used in a 180 to indicate the ringtone to play but
   it could also be sent in a response like a 486 to indicate what sort
   of busy tone to play. It could also be used in an UPDATE message.

4. MIDI Background

   MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol defined by
   the MIDI Manufacturers Association for use by computerized musical
   instruments such as synthesizers and keyboards and to represent
   musical instrument scores on computer systems. MIDI is a very
   complete and expressive protocol, capable of representing virtually
   everything required for a complete performance on an instrument or
   instruments. MIDI has also been used to convey other signaling
   information related to musical performances, such as control of
   lighting and changing settings on sound effect and public address
   equipment. MIDI has been used extensively for many years (since 1983)
   and is a stable and well established protocol.

   MIDI is currently used in telephony for representation of ringtones
   for mobile phones. While the level of expressiveness available is far
   richer than needed, the protocol can also be used to represent the
   various tones that are generated by phones in each country.

   MIDI is an event based system. Events are presented in sequential
   order and interpreted by the playback device in that order. For
   example, one MIDI event might indicate that a note should begin to
   play, and the following event could indicate that that note should be
   released and stop playing. Each event is prefixed by a delta time,
   which is used to indicate the time that should elapse before that
   event occurs. If the note mentioned above is to be sounded for 1
   second, the release note event would be prefixed by a delta time of 1
   second, indicating that the note should be allowed to play for one
   second before being released.

   MIDI, as a language for musicians, is oriented towards notes and
   beats, rather than the frequencies and times more common in the
   telecommunications and networking worlds. MIDI does, however, support
   using absolute times in place of beats, as discussed on the Open
   Issues section of this draft. Delta times, discussed above, are
   typically represented as counts and beats, and notes are represented
   as integers representing a particular musical note in the chromatic
   (western) scale, and not a given frequency.

   In addition to defining the events that can be generated, MIDI
   defines a format for files to store songs as sequences of such
   events. The regular MIDI protocol is often used exclusive of this
   file format, for example to allow one musical instrument to control

   another on the fly, but we will use the file format as we wish to
   represent a pre-defined sequence of musical events.

   The General MIDI standard was added in 1991 to further standardize
   some features that were not fully specified in the original MIDI
   spec. Among the things that General MIDI addresses is a numbering
   scheme for patches, or types of musical instrument sounds that should
   be used (Grand Piano is sound 1, Sawtooth wave is 82, etc.).
   Unfortunately for telecommunications, no sine wave tone is specified.
   General MIDI also suggests default values for most parameters in
   MIDI. We take advantage of these suggested defaults in this document,
   as they are widely used in the industry.

5. MIDI to Represent Tones

   MIDI offers considerably greater expressiveness that is required for
   the generation of simple tones, but a number of MIDI events are
   required to properly reproduce the tones generated by a typical
   endpoint.

   MIDI represents start and stop events for particular musical notes,
   but the tones used in telephony signaling are often not whole musical
   notes, but rather tones of arbitrary frequency. To properly represent
   these arbitrary pitches, one must precede the event representing the
   start of the tone with a bend event that alters the frequency of the
   note away from the chromatic musical pitch to an arbitrary frequency
   prior to it being "struck". This is commonly done in MIDI to
   represent bends as well as to represent musical notes for non-western
   music, in which the frequencies may not correspond to the chromatic
   musical notes.

   MIDI pitch bends (also called pitch wheel events) represent the
   degree that the note is changed as a 14 bit integer (0-16383), where
   the midpoint (8192) represents no pitch bend, and either extreme
   represents the maximum or minimum possible bend for a particular MIDI
   device. While the range of pitch bend these correspond to is not
   enforced by the protocol, a range of two half steps up and two half
   steps down (four half steps total range) is recommended by the
   General MIDI specification and used by most devices.

   A half step represents a change from one MIDI note to the next, so
   any arbitrary pitch can be obtained by bending up or down by less
   than one half step from some note. The 14 bits are represented in a
   16 bit integer in MIDI files where the bytes 0 to 6 in the first half
   of the 16 bit integer represent bits 0 to 6 of the 14 bit values, and
   bits 9 to 15 in the second half of the 16 bit integer represent bits
   7 to 13 of the 14 bit value. As such, the 16 bit representation of
   the midpoint is defined in hex as 0x0040, and a bend of one half step

   up or down are represented by 0x0060 and 0x0020 respectively. We show
   a worked example of calculating the pitch events needed to generate
   the arbitrary tones in a later section.

   MIDI can represent times either using beats, or using absolute times.
   While absolute times might seem to be the better choice for a
   technology driven application, the beat type system is more common in
   MIDI files. We will discuss the beat-based mechanism here, and leave
   discussion of the merits of one system or the other to the open
   issues section.

   The header for MIDI files includes data that specifies the time to be
   used. Two bytes in this header represent (in Big Endian) how many
   clocks there are in a quarter note of music. Later, one can specify
   time signature (such as 4/4 or 3/4) and speed, in beats per minute
   (bpm). General MIDI specifies that, unless modified, a signature of
   4/4 and a speed of 120 bpm are to be assumed. This means that 120
   quarter notes occur in a minute, or that a quarter note lasts for
   half a second. If a value of 500 clocks is assigned to one quarter
   note in the header, each clock used in the delta times in our file
   will thus represent 1ms of clock time, a convenient time unit for
   recreating telephony tones.

   With the time specified in the header, we can represent delta times
   elapsed between events as milliseconds, but we need to understand how
   MIDI represents delta times in the file. Delta times are represented
   as a Variable Length Quantity. This is a mechanism to allow numbers
   of arbitrary size to be represented with the length of the
   representation in the file increasing as the size of the number
   represented increases. The first seven bits (right justified) of a
   byte represent data, while the last bit is 0 if no more bytes of
   information are needed, and 1 if another byte is needed to represent
   the number. Numbers from 1-127 (2^7) can thus be represented using
   one byte, adding a second byte will allow numbers as large as 2^14,
   adding a third byte allows numbers as large as 2^21, etc. We show a
   worked example of calculating delta times as Variable Length
   Quantities in the Constructing Telephone Tones section.

   The tones we wish to generate are also composed of pure sinusoidal
   tones, whereas most music is generated using samples of actual
   musical instruments based on more complex wave forms. General MIDI
   offers pre-defined patches for some of the most common musical
   instruments, as well as sawtooth and square waves, but fails to offer
   a pre-defined patch for a sine wave. We discuss this further in the
   open issues section. Our recommendation is that sound 125 (0x7D),
   mapped to "Telephone Ring" in general MIDI, be interpreted as a sine
   wave.

   While developing tone files on a conventional synthesizer, one may
   wish to use sound 82 (0x52), mapped to "Sawtooth Wave" in general
   MIDI, since this sound most closely resembles a sine wave, and leads
   to tones that sound very close when playing back with a general MIDI
   sequencer.

   MIDI files consist of a header, providing basic information about the
   file (including the time information discussed above) and one or more
   tracks containing MIDI events. In our examples, we use only one
   track, and recommend this for users creating files.

   There is no standard mechanism defined in MIDI files to specify that
   the file should played repeatedly. For most tones representing phone
   sounds, the pattern is an infinitely repeating pattern, or should be
   played for a certain amount of time before switching to a different
   tone (for example from dialtone to off hook). Information about
   whether to repeat a file over and over, for a certain time, etc. is
   conveyed with attached signaling information, as specified in the
   Signaling to Play Tones section of this draft. If possible, users
   should attempt to create tone files that can be looped easily and are
   as short as possible.

6. Examples

6.1 Signaling to Play Tones

   The following section shows an example of the signaling for a typical
   ringback tone use. Alice calls a PSTN GW which sends back a 180
   ringing response with a ringback tone description using MIDI.

7. UA behavior

   A SIP UAC that can play MIDI tones SHOULD indicate that it supports
   the MIDI media type in the Accept header.

8. Required MIDI support

   As specified by MIDI, endpoints MUST assume 4/4 time and 120 bpm if
   no other time is specified. Users generating ring files MUST NOT
   specify an alternate time signature or tempo. Devices interpreting
   these files MAY correctly interpret time signature and tempo change
   events, but should reasonably expect that these events will not
   appear in files sent to them. Users creating files MAY specify a
   number of clocks per beat other than 500, and devices interpreting
   these files MUST correctly interpret the clocks per beat
   specification in the MIDI header file.

   A device interpreting a MIDI file to generate telephone tones MUST
   interpret the range of the pitch wheel to be four half-steps total
   (two half-steps up and two half-steps down).

   A device interpreting a MIDI file MUST interpret general MIDI sample
   number 125 ("Telephone Ringing Effect") to be a pure sinusoidal wave.

   A device interpreting a MIDI file MUST be able to interpret a format
   0 MIDI file. It MAY interpret other MIDI types. Users generating tone
   files MUST use MIDI format 0.

   A device interpreting a MIDI file MUST be able to handle 1 track of
   data. It MAY accept more than one track. Users generating tone files
   MUST use a single track of data.

   Users generating tones SHOULD use a velocity of 0x40 (medium
   velocity) unless they require one tone to be louder than another.
   TODO They should use velocity 0xXX to represent XX db less, 0xXX to
   represent XX db less, and 0xXX to represent XX db less.

   Users generating tones should terminate them with velocity 0x7F
   (silence as quickly as possible) unless there is a reason to fade the
   note.

   Users generating tones MUST encode them so that they can be looped,
   if the tone is designed to be repeated infinitely. Users SHOULD make
   the sample as small as possible (for example, an alternating on-off
   pattern should only specify one each of on and off) to minimize the
   size of the file. Users SHOULD make the sample 5 seconds long in the
   event that the file is a continuous tone.

9. Constructing Telephone Tones

   We present as an example a file to represent the US Busy signal. The
   US busy signal consists of 480Hz and 620Hz tones. These two tones are
   played simultaneously in a repeated pattern of 0.5 seconds of tone,
   followed by 0.5 seconds of silence.

   Since neither 480Hz nor 620Hz correspond to a standard musical pitch,
   both need to be pitch bent from a nearby musical tone to reach the
   appropriate frequency.

   To produce 480Hz, we bend up from note 70 (0x46), an A-sharp at
   approximately 466.164Hz, toward note 71, a B at approximately
   493.883Hz. A MIDI pitch bend is represented by a 14bit integer, with
   values ranging from 0 to 16383. The midpoint of this range, 8192,
   represents that the note receives no pitch bend from the musical
   note. Assuming the suggested standard where a value of 0 represents a
   bend of 2 half-steps down, and a value of 16383 represents a bend up
   of 2 half-steps up, we calculate our pitch value by linear
   interpolation.

   The difference between the two notes is one half-step and 27.719Hz.
   One half- step is 4096 "units" of pitch bend, so each unit
   corresponds to 0.00677Hz. 480Hz requires us to bend up 13.836Hz from
   note 70 at 466.164Hz, or 2044 units. Since 8192 represents the center
   of our pitch bend (half of a 14 bit value), we add 2044 to this to
   bend up. Our pitch bend thus needs to send a value of 10236. In
   binary, this is 10011111111100. We map this to a 16 bit integer by
   placing the first 7 bits in the first half of the 16 bit integer,
   padded with a 0, and the last 7 bits in the second half of the 16 bit
   integer, padded with a 0, as shown below:

   10011111111100 => 1001111 1111100 => 01001111 01111100

   We reverse these to get the proper order for the MIDI message format,
   and we have:

   01111100 01001111 => 0x7C4F

   Similarly, we can calculate a pitch of 620Hz. Note 74 is 587.330Hz,
   and note 75 is 622.254. We bend down 2.254Hz from note 75. The
   difference between the notes is 34.924Hz, so each unit of pitch bend
   corresponds to 0.00853Hz. We thus need to bend down 264 units from
   note 75 (0x4B). With 8192 being center, we need a pitch value of
   7928. Calculating as the 16 bit value as above, this returns 0x783D
   as the pitch bend required.

   We now know the notes and pitch bends we need, but need to calculate

   the time required. We have set up the file as defined above to use
   500 clocks to represent a quarter note, and assume 4/4 time with 120
   bpm. This means a quarter note is one beat, and there are 120 beats
   per minute. Thus, there are 120 quarter notes in a minute, and each
   is 500 clocks long. We thus have 60000 clocks in a minute, or 1000
   clocks per second. Each clock is thus 1ms. Since a busy signal
   alternates 0.5 seconds on and 0.5 seconds off, we need to use 500
   clocks between turning the notes on and turning them off again.

   We need to represent 500 as a Variable Length Quantity. One can find
   utilities to convert this online, but we will convert this by hand.:

   500 can be represented in binary as 111110100. Breaking this into 7
   bit chunks, and padding with leading zeros, we have 0000011 1110100.
   We will need two bytes to represent this value. The first will begin
   with a 1, indicating that a second byte follows, and the second will
   begin with a 0, indicating that no more bytes follow. Thus, we have
   the following two bytes:

   10000011 01110100 => 0x83 0x74. This will be used as our delta time
   before we silence the notes.

   With these values calculated, we can look at the complete MIDI file
   for a US dialtone.

   The file begins with a MIDI header: 4D 54 68 64 00 00 00 06 00 01 00
   01 01 F4

   The header can be broken down as follows

   |                  | hard we strike the note. 0x40 represents a     |
   |                  | middle velocity or volume note.                |
   | 00 91 4B 40      | Start the second note on channel 1. We now     |
   |                  | have both tones sounding.                      |
   | 83 74 80 46 7F   | Wait 0x83 0x74 time units (0.5 seconds), then  |
   |                  | signal event 80. 80 turns off a note on        |
   |                  | channel 0. The note to be turned off is note   |
   |                  | 46, which we turned on, then silenced with two |
   |                  | instances of event 90 above. The final byte,   |
   |                  | 7f, represents the speed to stop the note. 7f  |
   |                  | means turn the note off immediately, with no   |
   |                  | fade.                                          |
   | 00 81 4B 7F      | After an additional 0 seconds (in other words, |
   |                  | at the same time as the event above), silence  |
   |                  | the other note. Event 81 turns off a note on   |
   |                  | channel 1, the note to turn off is the 4B we   |
   |                  | created with the 91 event, and we turn it off  |
   |                  | as quickly as possible.                        |
   | 83 74 FF 2F 00   | Wait another 0x83 0x74 time units (0.5         |
   |                  | seconds), then signal end of track. This gives |
   |                  | us a 0.5 second pause at the end of the file.  |
   |                  | 0xFF 0x2F 0x00 is the End of Track Magic word. |

10. Security Considerations

   This section still needs work.

   A UA needs to be very careful on who it accepts tones from because
   the user attributes particular meaning to the tones, which, if the
   tone is wrong, may not correspond to what is really happening.

11. Open Issues

   Someone should get IANA to register audio/midi

   Get someone with a frequency counter or oscilloscope to check the
   math and make sure the frequencies calculated are correct - just
   because they sound right doesn't mean 100% they are..

   No Sine Wave, so we use 125 for Telephone Ringing. Are there problems
   with this?

   Timing note style (more common) vs. absolute (more "techie" and less
   musician). Should we use the style more common in MIDI or more
   familiar to telephony/network people?

   Measure and determine velocity values to produce sounds that are so
   many db more or less than others. This is likely to be inexact since
   different synthesizers may play the files differently. Endpoints
   should be calibrated to make them correct.

   Verify there is no standard way of representing looping and discuss
   what we want to do to allow for it in the absence of a standard way
   to represent.

   Explain how the modulated form works that is used in some countries,
   and determine if there is a way to reproduce this in a standard way
   in MIDI.

   Write security section

12. Acknowledgements

   This reused work from the earlier drafts by Adam Roach [4] and Rohan
   Mahy[3].

13. Appendix A: Country Reference

   This appendix lists tones that might be used in various countries as
   an aid to developers. It is not known to be correct and is not
   normative in any way.

   The frequency is in Hz and + means to play both tones simultaneously
   while * means modulate one tone with the other. A / indicates the
   first tone is played then the second tone is played. Duration is the
   on time followed by the off time in seconds.
