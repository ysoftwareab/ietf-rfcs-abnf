Internet draft         Initial AD Assignment Plan          June 30, 1993


3  Introduction

This memo presents the plan for initial assignments of Administrative
Domain numbers for the Version 7 Internet.  The objective is to use a
very small amount of space in the numbering system, while providing
the necessary distribution of authority.

This plan defines 4/256ths of the number space to cover the country
blocks, while making initial AD-block assignments for countries
covering only 237/65536ths (0.36%) of the code points available in the
most significant 16 bits.

It is important that future plans be equally conservative; in the next
decade no more than 1/25th of the space need be or should be assigned.
Besides the always-unanticipated future expansion, this provides the
space to re-do the numbering plan entirely if it should become
necessary.

It is certainly true that in 10 years, or 25 years, we shall know a
great deal more about what the numbering plan should look like, and it
is prudent to leave as much of the decision as possible to that time.

4  Authority for AD assignments

AD numbers are assigned out of the same numbering plan as (version 4)
network numbers.  As noted in [RFC1475] this helps prevent confusion
when the first part of an IPv7 8-octet address is erroneously used as
an IPv4 address.  It also may be useful in routing ADs with existing
routing protocols.

4.1  IANA

The initial authority for AD assignements is IANA, the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA@ISI.EDU).  The IANA may delegate
national blocks with initial octets 220 to 223 in the numbering plan
to national authority when an appropriate organization applies for
them.

The initial AD plan also discusses specific assignments of blocks for
interoperation with numbering plans.  Two non-national blocks are
described in the initial numbering plan, one for Novell/IPX, and one
used for IEEE 802 addressing.  Each of these would require a
class-B-size number allocation.  The specific allocations are not
specified in this plan.

Individual AD numbers should be assigned only when there is an
expectation that the delegated authority will need to assign on the
order of a million network numbers (an AD has space for 16 million
networks), or where a clear division of authority is required (e.g.  a
national administration).  Note that under the first of those
qualifications, the entire present Internet qualifies as only one AD.

Internet draft         Initial AD Assignment Plan          June 30, 1993


It is important that the number of ADs be initially limited to perhaps
several hundred, probably aligned with countries.  This facilitates
aggregation of routing information given the limitations of present
routing technology in the Internet.

4.2  ISO/ITU

Authority for assignments of ADs should eventually be vested in the
proper international organization, either the ITU and/or the ISO.
This is probably an issue that should eventually be taken up by the
proper committee of the Joint Technical Committee (JTC).

At present, the AD plan borrows an existing numbering plan for
countries, IS 3166.  This plan provides for two-letter, three-letter,
and three-digit codes for countries, where a country is a member of
the UN or a (possibly disputed) territory or other area recognized by
the UN.  (Note that this includes the idea of the UN simply
recognizing that the area is disputed; see the entity coded "NT" in
the 1988 two-letter code.)

The Internet already uses IS 3166 as the authority for the two-letter
top-level names used in the domain naming system to delegate naming to
national authority.

5  Country blocks

Each country (using the definitions of IS 3166) is assigned a block of
256 AD numbers, i.e.  a 16 bit number at the top of the numbering
plan.  The specific block number is derived from the three digit code
(ISO-3) assigned by IS 3166.  The first octet has value 220 plus ISO-3
divided by 250.  The second octet has the value ISO-3 modulo 250.
This assigns AD blocks in the range 220.0 to 223.249.

This is in the very top of the class C range, in a reserved area (see
[RFC1466]).  The use of this range is only a proposal; this plan could
be used with any base number presently unallocated, except for the
class D range, due to the unfortunate assignment of "multicast"
semantics known a priori to the IP.

The fact that this assigns "large" blocks in some cases to very small
countries is not considered to be important.  (Rather, the premise
that all countries should have equal "importance" in the numbering
system is considered paramount.)

This is not a geographical assignment system.  The assignments are
administrative, delegated to national authority.  A network assigned
within a country-derived AD may be physically located anywhere.  It
is, however, intended to provide a reasonable point of aggregation;
networks and ADs outside the "default" area for the block will
increase the demands on the routing system.

Internet draft         Initial AD Assignment Plan          June 30, 1993


While it is advisable for a country to assign individual ADs, there is
nothing to preclude a national plan using the entire country block;
that decision is specifically reserved to the national authority.  The
question as to whether the numbering plan within the ADs or block
should be correlated with topology, geography, or other constraints is
also reserved to national authority.  It should be kept in mind that
the DNS architecture requires that major authority delegations be made
on octet boundaries.

Certain large countries may need additional block assignments
eventually.  If the ISO or ITU authority is established at that time,
assignments will be made by the appropriate procedure within ISO
and/or the ITU.  If not, the national authority should apply to the
IANA, requesting information on where and how to proceed.

6  Specific Non-country Assignments

There are several assignments of ADs or blocks for specific
compatibility with existing plans.  As mentioned previously, these are
allocated by IANA within the existing assigned numbers plan; an AD
requires the equivalent of a class C assignment, a block requires a
class B assignment.

6.1  Version 4 Zone

The AD 192.0.0 is assigned to the present Version 4 numbering plan.
This AD has a specific plan for assignments within it:  the first 24
bits are the AD (192.0.0), the next 8-24 bits are a network number,
each assigned to a specific organization, and the remaining 16-40 bits
are assigned to subnets and hosts by authority reserved to the
specific organization.

Calling this "version 4" is somewhat of a misnomer.  Internet version
4 systems may exist within any AD that uses the 24/24/16 split between
AD, network, and subnet/host; but at this writing all existing version
4 systems are defined to be within AD 192.0.0.

6.2  Novell IPX

The internetwork protocol (IPX) used by products of Novell Corporation
and other vendors making interoperable software have used a 32-bit LAN
network number, implicitly concatenated with the 48 bit MAC layer
address to form an internet address.  The network numbers were not
assigned by any central authority, and thus were not useful for
inter-organizational traffic without substantial prior arrangement.

There is now an authority, established by Novell, to assign unique
32-bit numbers and blocks of numbers, to organizations that desire the
ability to do inter-organization networking with the IPX protocol.
Novell has also standardized the encapsulation of IPX over the
Internet Protocol.  [RFC1234]

Internet draft         Initial AD Assignment Plan          June 30, 1993


The Novell/IPX authority may be contacted to request assignments by
calling +1 408 321 1506 or by sending mail to registry@novell.com.

The Novell/IPX numbering plan is assigned the block (tba) within the
Version 7 numbering plan.  It has a specific structure for numbering
within the block:  the first 16 bits are the Novell/IPX block number,
the next 32 bits are the unique network number assigned to the LAN,
and the last 16 bits are a host number assigned, probably by a (to be
specified) dynamic method within the LAN.

The existance of a number within the Novell/IPX block for a host does
not imply that the host is Novell protocol capable.  The numbers are
equally useful for both IP version 7 and IPX.

The dynamic method for local address assignment might be specific to
IPX, or it might be the general method used for any IPv7 local network
with 16 bits of host number.

While the assignment of a block, rather than a single AD number, is
exceptional, in view of the very large base of Novell systems it seems
reasonable to accomodate the 32-bit IPX network numbers directly.

In particular, RAP can be used to route IPv4, IPv7, and IPX/IPv7
traffic in a combined network.

6.3  IEEE 802 block

The IEEE block provides a local address for any host with a LAN
interface.  The address format is as follows:  the first 16 bits are
the block number (tba), the remaining 48 bits are the address assigned
to the host (or interface card, which is more typical).  The 802
address is in canonical bit order [ref tbs].

Because addresses in this block do not have any useable structure, the
host is unlikely to be able to communicate beyond the local network.
The routing protocol may propagate routes to individual hosts a short
distance (i.e.  into adjacent LANs) but is unlikely to advertise them
very widely.

The primary use for addresses in this block is to give hosts an
immediately useable address, without any prior configuration.  This
permits the host to then initiate an auto-configuration protocol with
a local net manager, authenticate itself, and find out or register its
name and/or wide area Internet address.

The block also provides a permanent address for simple hosts that do
not want to communicate off of the LAN, such as a toaster.  Use of an
address within this block does not provide actual security, and MUST
NOT be used in an attempt to prevent access except (e.g.) via an
application relay:  the routing protocol(s) MAY propagate a route to
the host an arbitrary distance.  Hosts that begin with an 802 derived
address and then do autoconfiguration SHOULD continue to recognize the
address after the configuration is complete, and MAY originate new
traffic from that address.

Hosts using an address in this block MUST be capable of replying to
ARP requests.  Hosts trying to reach such a host MUST use ARP (or
other defined ES-IS-like protocol specified for the media) to resolve
the address (and, implicitly, determine which interface to use to
reach the other host).  They MUST NOT extract the 802 address from the
IPv7 address.

Digression:  note that there is a presumption here that it is
reasonable behavior for any host or router to ARP for an address that
it has no particular route for.  In the presence of general proxy-ARP,
this is indeed a reasonable idea, given that someone out there may be
able to reply.  This means that a TP/IX-IPv7 host need not give
addresses in this block special treatment in the IP layer route
resolution.

In the future, as "addresses" are pushed more toward the proper role
as endpoint-identifiers, and not used to route datagrams, this block
may become more useful.
