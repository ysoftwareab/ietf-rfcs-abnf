       DNS Root Name Service Protocol and Deployment Requirements
                        draft-iab-2870bis-02.txt

Abstract

   The DNS Root Name service is a critical part of the Internet
   architecture.  The protocol and deployment requirements expected to
   be implemented for the DNS root name service are defined in this
   document.  Operational requirements are out of scope.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC2870] discusses protocol and operational requirements for root
   name servers for Internet's domain name system(DNS) protocol
   [RFC1035].  Since its publication, both protocol and operational
   requirements have evolved.  It makes more sense now to separate the
   two sets of requirements into two separate documents.  The
   operational requirements are defined in [RSSAC-001].  This document
   defines the protocol requirements and some deployment requirements.

   The root servers are authoritative servers of the unique [RFC2826]
   root zone (".")[ROOTZONE].  They currently also serve the root-
   servers.net zone.  Some also serve the zone for the .arpa top-level
   domain[ARPAZONE].  This document describes the external interface of
   the root name servers from a protocol viewpoint of the service.  It
   specifies basic requirements for the Internet that DNS clients meet
   when interacting with a root name service over the public Internet.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

1.1.  RFC 2870 as Historic

   This document obsoletes and reclassifies [RFC2870] as Historic.

   This document and [RSSAC-001] together functionally replace
   [RFC2870].

2.  Protocol Requirements

   This section describes the minimum high-level protocol requirements.
   Operative details are documented in [RSSAC-001] and implementation is
   left to the operators of the root name service.

   The root name service:

Internet-Draft       Root Name Service Requirements        February 2015


      MUST implement core DNS [RFC1035] and clarifications to the DNS
      [RFC2181].

      MUST support IPv4[RFC0791] and IPv6[RFC2460] transport of DNS
      queries and responses.

      MUST support UDP[RFC0768] and TCP[RFC0793] transport of DNS
      queries and responses.

      MUST generate checksums when sending UDP datagrams and MUST verify
      checksums when receiving UDP datagrams containing a non-zero
      checksum.

      MUST implement DNSSEC[RFC4035], as an authoritative name service.

3.  Deployment Requirements

   The root name service:

      MUST answer queries from any entity conforming to [RFC1122] with a
      valid IP address.

      MUST serve the unique [RFC2826] root zone[ROOTZONE].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not specify a new protocol.  However, the root
   name service is a key component of the Internet architecture and play
   a key role into the overall security of the Internet[RFC2826].
   Specific security considerations on the DNS protocols are discussed
   in their respective specifications.  The security considerations on
   the operational side of the root name servers are discussed in
   [RSSAC-001].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no action for IANA.
