                    IPv6 Universal Extension Header
           draft-gont-6man-ipv6-universal-extension-header-01

Abstract

   This document analyzes a problem in the Uniform Format for IPv6
   Extension Headers specified in RFC 6564, which results in nodes not
   being able to process an IPv6 Header Chain if it contains an
   unrecognized IPv6 Extension Header that follows the aforementioned
   Uniform Format.  It analyzes the implications of the aforementioned
   problem, and discusses a number of possible solutions, including the
   specification of a new IPv6 Extension Header - the Universal
   Extension Header - that overcomes the aforementioned issues.

1.  Introduction

   There has recently been a lot of work in the area of IPv6 Extension
   Headers.  Firstly, there has been research about the extent to which
   IPv6 Extension Headers are dropped in the public Internet
   [GONT-IEPG-Nov13] [GONT-IEPG-Mar14], and debate about the motivation
   behind such policy [I-D.taylor-v6ops-fragdrop].  Secondly, there has
   been a fair share of work to improve some technicalities of IPv6
   Extension Headers [RFC7112] [RFC7045], in the hopes that they can be
   reliably used in the public Internet.

   A key challenge for IPv6 Extension Headers to be "deployable" in the
   public Internet is that they should not impair any nodes's ability to
   process the entire IPv6 header chain.  One of the steps meant in that
   direction has been the specification of a Uniform Format for IPv6



Gont, et al.            Expires October 10, 2014                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft         Universal Extension Header             April 2014


   Extension Headers [RFC6564], which was meant to be employed by any
   IPv6 Extension Headers that might be defined in the future, such that
   middle-boxes can still process the entire IPv6 header chain if the
   new extension headers employ the Uniform Format.  However, a problem
   in the aforementioned specification prevents such uniform format from
   being of use in practice.

   Section 3 discusses the aforementioned flaw in the Uniform Format for
   Extension Headers specified in [RFC6564].  Section 4 explicitly
   describes the implications of the aforementioned flaw.  Section 5
   discusses possible workarounds for the aforementioned problem.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  A Problem with RFC 6564

   A key problem with the Uniform Format for IPv6 Extension Headers
   [RFC6564] lies in that both IPv6 Extension Headers and Transport
   Protocols share the same namespace ("Next Header" registry/
   namespace).  Thus, given an "unknown Next Header value", it is
   impossible to tell whether the aforementioned value refers to an IPv6
   Extension Header that employs the aforementioned uniform format, or
   an "unknown" upper-layer protocol (e.g. an "unknown" transport
   protocol).  That is, while [RFC6564] specifies the syntax for the
   Uniform Format for IPv6 Extension Headers, but it does not provide a
   mechanism for a node to identify whether the aforementioned format is
   being employed in the first place.

4.  Implications

   The current impossibility to parse an IPv6 header chain that includes
   unknown Next Header values results in concrete implications for the
   extensibility of the IPv6 protocol, and the deployability of IPv6
   extension headers.  Namely,

   o  New IPv6 extension headers cannot be incrementally deployed.

   o  New transport protocols cannot be deployed.

   Since there is no way for a node to process IPv6 extension headers
   that employ unknown next header values, an IPv6 host that receives a
   packet that employs a new IPv6 extension header will not be able to
   parse the IPv6 header chain past that unknown extension header, and
   hence it will drop the aforementioned packet.  In a similar way, a



Gont, et al.            Expires October 10, 2014                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         Universal Extension Header             April 2014


   middlebox that needs to process the transport-protocol header will be
   faced with the dilemma of what to do with packets that employ unknown
   Next Header values.  Since they will not be able to parse the IPv6
   header chain past the unknown Next Header, it is very likely that
   they will drop such packets.

   Unfortunately, since transport protocols share the same namespace as
   IPv6 Extension Headers, new transport protocols will pose the same
   challenge to middle-boxes, and hence they will be likely dropped in
   the network.

   We believe that the current situation has implications that are
   generally overlooked, and that, whatever the outcome, it should be
   the result of an explicit decision by our community, rather than
   simply "omission".

5.  Possible Solutions

   The following subsections describe alternative solutions to the
   problem described in this document.  Section 5.1 proposes to specify
   a new (and last) IPv6 header, such that any further IPv6 extensions
   employ such header.  Section 5.2 simply proposes to reserve a range
   of "Next Header" values to be used with the Uniform Extension Header
   format specified in [RFC6564].  Finally, Section 5.3 simply proposes
   that no new IPv6 Extension Headers be allowed, and hence any unknown
   Next Header value is assumed to be an unknown upper-layer header
   (e.g. transport protocol header).  Section 5.4 provides a summary and
   comparison of the properties of each of the different alternative
   solutions.

      NOTE: We expect that the 6man wg arrives to consensus on pursuing
      any of these alternative solutions, and that the rest be abandoned
      in future revisions of this document.

5.1.  Specification of a Universal Extension Header (UEH)

   This solution implies the specification of a new (and last) IPv6
   Extension Header, the IPv6 Universal Extension Header (UEH), which
   should be employed by any further IPv6 extensions.  Additionally,
   specification of any further IPv6 Extension Headers are forbidden.

   The advantages of this approach is that a single "Next Header" value
   is used for any future IPv6 Extensions (a new namespace is created by
   means of the "Subtype" field).

      NOTE: Procedurally-speaking, the specification of the UEH could be
      performed by an update to RFC6564 (as proposed in the next

      subsection), or by a new RFC that completely obsoletes [RFC6564],
      as in [rfc6564bis].

5.1.1.  UEH Specification

   The entire Section 4 of [RFC6564] is hereby replaced as follows:

   New IPv6 Extension Headers MUST NOT be specified.  Any IPv6
   extensions that would require a new IPv6 Extension Header MUST be
   implemented with the Universal Extension Header specified in this
   document.  This minimizes breakage in intermediate nodes that examine
   these extension headers.

   This document specifies a new IPv6 Extension Header: Universal
   Extension Header.  This Extension Header is identified by the value
   [TBD] of [IANA-IP-PROTO].  The syntax of the Universal Extension
   Header is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Next Header  |  Hdr Ext Len  |    Subtype    |               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+               +
      |                                                               |
      .                                                               .
      .                   Subtype Specific Data                        .
      .                                                               .
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   where:

   Next Header
      8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header immediately
      following the extension header.  Uses the same values as the IPv4
      Protocol field [IANA-IP-PROTO].

   Hdr Ext Len
      8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the extension header in 8-octet
      units, not including the first 8 octets.

   Subtype
      8-bit unsigned integer.  Specifies the subtype for this extension
      header.  It uses a new namespace managed by IANA [IANA-UEH].

   Subtype Specific Data

      Variable length.  Fields specific to this extension header/
      Subtype.

   The Universal Extension Header specified in this document MAY appear
   multiple times in the same IPv6 packet.

5.1.2.  IANA Considerations for UEH

   IANA is requested to create a new registry to maintain the Universal
   Extension Header Subtypes [IANA-UEH].

5.1.3.  Operation of the UEH

   This section discusses de operation of the Universal Extension
   Header.

   The goal of the UEH is to provide for a common syntax for all future
   IPv6 extensions.  Any future extension headers will be encoded in a
   UEH, and will be identified by a specific UEH Subtype assigned by
   IANA at the time the corresponding specification is published.  The
   UEH thus provides for the "common syntax" required to process
   "unrecognized extensions", and the Subtype field identifies the
   specific extension being encoded in the UEH.  Any "future extension
   headers" would actually be new Subtypes (assigned by IANA) of the
   UEH.

   As a result, in the event an unrecognized Next Header value is
   encountered by a node, the node will be able to assume that such Next
   Header value identifies an upper-layer protocol, rather than an
   extension header.

5.2.  Reserving a Next Header range for RFC 6564

   Another possible solution would be to instruct IANA to reserve a
   range of Next Header values to be employed for IPv6 Extension Headers
   employing the Uniform Extension Header format specified in [RFC6564].
   Thus, a node that receives a packet with an unknown Next Header value
   would proceed as follows:

   o  If the unknown Next Header value is in the range assigned by IANA
      for RFC6564, the aforementioned header is assumed to follow the
      Uniform Extension Header specified in [RFC6564].

   o  Otherwise, the Next Header value is assumed to refer to an upper-
      layer protocol header (e.g. a transport protocol).

Internet-Draft         Universal Extension Header             April 2014


   The advantage of this solution is that it requires very little
   standardization effort.  The drawback is that a potentially large
   number of "Next Header" values might be wasted.

5.3.  Prohibiting New Extension Headers

   Among the possible solutions is to simply prohibit the specification
   of any new IPv6 Extension Headers.  Thus, an unknown "Next Header"
   value would unambiguously refer to an upper-layer protocol (e.g. a
   transport protocol).

   The advantage of this approach is that it requires minimum
   standardization work.  The drawback is that, while it is generally
   assumed that any new extensions could be implemented with the
   existing IPv6 Extension Headers, it might be premature to forbid the
   specification of new extension headers at this point in time.

   The contents of this section will depend on the solution the 6man wg
   adopts.

7.  Security Considerations

   The inability to parse an entire IPv6 header chain prevents the
   enforcement of even simple ACLs.  This document describes possible
   solutions to this problem such that, if deemed necessary, middle-
   boxes can process the entire IPv6 header chain to Enabling middle-
   boxes such as firewalls to inspect the entire IPv6 header chain even
   in the presence of unrecognized extensions allows for security

   mechanisms to be implemented, and for proper functioning of of other
