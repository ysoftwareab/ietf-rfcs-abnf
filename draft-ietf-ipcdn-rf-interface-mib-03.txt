Abstract

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for
SNMP-based management of MCNS compliant Radio Frequency (RF) interfaces.

This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
SNMPv2 SMI.  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework
and existing SNMP standards.

This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet
Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be addressed
to the working group's mailing list at ipcdn@terayon.com and/or the
author.

1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework presently consists of three
major components.  They are:

o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
     describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

o    the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] - the core set of managed objects
     for the Internet suite of protocols.

o    the protocol, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the protocol for
     accessing managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
experimentation and evaluation.


2.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
an administratively assigned name.  The object type together with an
object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of
the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

INTERNET-DRAFT           MCNS RF Interface MIB              January 1998


3.  Overview

This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of MCNS
compliant Cable Modem (CM) and Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) RF
interfaces.  The specification is derived from the MCNS Radio Frequency
Interface specification [6].


3.1.  Structure of the MIB

This MIB is structured in three groups:

o    Information required both in Cable Modems and Cable Modem
     Termination systems.

o    Information required in Cable Modems only.

o    Information required in Cable Modem Termination Systems only.


3.1.1.  General Description

3.2.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB

This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB to the Interfaces
MIB [5].  Several areas of correlation are addressed in the following
subsections.  The implementor is referred to the Interfaces MIB document
in order to understand the general intent of these areas.


3.2.1.  Layering Model

An instance of ifEntry exists for each RF Downstream interface, for each
RF Upstream interface, and for each RF MAC layer.  The ifStackTable [5]
must be implemented to identify relationships among sub-interfaces.

The following example illustrates a MAC interface with one downstream
and two upstream channels.

                                   | <== to network layer
                     +-------------+--------------+
                     |           RF MAC           |
                     +----+---------+-----------+-+
                          |         |           |
                +---------+---+ +---+-------+ +-+---------+
                | Downstream1 | | Upstream1 | | Upstream2 |
                +-------------+ +-----------+ +-----------+

As can be seen from this example, the RF MAC interface is layered on top
of the downstream and upstream interfaces.

INTERNET-DRAFT           MCNS RF Interface MIB              January 1998


In this example, the assignment of index values could be as follows:

ifIndex ifType                   Description

   1    docsCableMaclayer(127)   CATV MAC Layer
   2    docsCableDownstream(128) CATV Downstream interface
   3    docsCableUpstream(129)   CATV Upstream interface
   4    docsCableUpstream(129)   CATV Upstream interface

The corresponding ifStack entries would then be:

        | IfStackHigherLayer | ifStackLowerLayer |
        |         0          |         1         |
        |         1          |         2         |
        |         1          |         3         |
        |         1          |         4         |
        |         2          |         0         |
        |         3          |         0         |
        |         4          |         0         |

The same interface model can also be used in Telco Return systems.  A
pure Telco Return system (Cable Modem as well as Cable Modem Termination
System) would not have upstream, but only downstream cable channels.
Systems supporting both Telco Return and cable upstream channels can use
the above model without modification.

Telco Return Upstream channel(s) are handled by the appropriate MIBs,
such as PPP or Modem MIBs.

3.2.2.  ifTestTable

The ifTestTable is not supported by this MIB.


3.2.3.  ifRcvAddressTable

The ifRcvAddressTable is not supported by this MIB.
