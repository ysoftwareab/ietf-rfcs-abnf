Abstract 
   
   This document provides an analysis of the requirements to support 
   mobility of hosts in IPv4 and IPv6 networks. In this document, 
   combinations of IPv4, IPv6, and dual stack mobile node moving in 
   IPv4, IPv6, and dual stack networks are listed and requirements to 
   support mobility under different network and mobile node 
   configurations are examined. This document aims to reassess existing 
   next generation transition (NGTRANS) tools from the point of view of 
   mobility. 

1. Introduction 

   Mobile IP (MIP) is capable of offering mobile services to terminals. 
   Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) [1] was designed for Internet Protocol version 4 
   (IPv4) and mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [2] has been also defined for IPv6. 
   Considering IPv4 to IPv6 transition, a number of protocols and 
   mechanisms are proposed to facilitate IPv4/IPv6 communication in 
   transition networks for different purposes and under different 
   assumptions. 
    



<Tsao, Tsirtsis, Boehm>       1

   [3] gives an overview of transition mechanisms within 
   IETF NGTRANS working group. However, these transition mechanisms 
   assume that hosts are attached to the network statically. The effects 
   of considering mobile node (MN) roaming in IPv4/IPv6 transition 
   networks have not been investigated. 
   
   In this document, requirements to support mobility of hosts in IPv4 
   and IPv6 networks are analyzed. Combinations of mobile nodes moving 
   in networks with different configurations are first listed and then 
   mechanisms to support handoffs in different scenarios are examined. 
   This document does not introduce new protocols and mechanisms, but 
   recommend implementations and configurations for some specific 
   handoffs. The principles behind this analysis are to maintain 
   existing connection of mobile nodes after handoff as much as 
   possible, and to maximize accessibility to the visited networks. 
   Moreover, tunneling mechanism is preferred rather than translators 
   due to security concern. Finally, route optimization is also 
   considered.

2. Terminology 

   IPv4-only network 
   A network that only implements IPv4. It can understand and process 
   IPv4 packets and MIPv4 messages but can not understand IPv6 and 
   MIPv6. 

   IPv6-only network 
   A network that only implements IPv6. It can understand and process 
   IPv6 packets and MIPv6 messages but can not understand IPv4 and 
   MIPv4. 

   Dual stack network (DS network) 
   A network that implements both IPv4 and IPv6. It can understand and 
   process both IPv4/IPv6 packets and MIPv4/MIPv6 messages. 

   IPv4-only mobile node (IPv4-only MN) 
   A node that implements IPv4, MIPv4 and has a global unique IPv4 
   address. 

   IPv6-only mobile node (IPv6-only MN) 
   A node that implements IPv6, MIPv6 and has a global unique IPv6 
   address. 

   Dual stack mobile node using IPv4 address (DS MNv4) 
   A node that has IPv4/IPv6 dual stack and a global unique IPv4 
   address. The node can change its point of attachment from one link to 
   another, while still being reachable via its IPv4 address. 

   Dual stack mobile node using IPv6 address (DS MNv6) 
   A node that has IPv4/IPv6 dual stack and a global unique IPv6 
   address. The node can change its point of attachment from one link to 
   another, while still being reachable via its IPv6 address.

                <draft-ietf-ngtrans-moving-00.txt>          <July, 2001> 
 
 
   IPv4-compatible IPv6 address 
   An address of the form 0::0:a.b.c.d which refers to an IPv6/IPv4 node 
   that supports automatic tunneling.

3. Combination 
   
   Table 1 lists all combinations of mobile node and its located 
   networks. Definitions of categories of mobile nodes and networks can 
   be referred to the terminologies defined in the previous section. For 
   example, Combination 1 is the case that an IPv6-only mobile node 
   stays in an IPv6-only network. The case of a MN with both IPv4 and 
   IPv6 address is not in the list since the MN can perform MIPv4 and 
   MIPv6 functions separately depending on the networks it visits. The 
   case does not introduce problems for MN roaming in IPv4/IPv6/DS 
   network. Among twelve combinations, Combination 2 and Combination 5 
   will result in the loss of connectivity of MN to the network. In the 
   next section, handoff scenarios based on the remaining 10 
   combinations are examined.

4. Handoff Scenarios 
   
   In this section, procedures and mechanisms to fulfill handoffs are 
   examined. Handoff is defined as a MN moving from one network to 
   another network. The handoff procedures include the registration of 
   MN's care-of address (COA) to its home agent and the maintenance of 
   the existing connections, said native connections, to its 
   correspondent nodes (CN). This document emphasizes on MIP 
   registration process and maintaining the native connections between 
   MN and its CNs during handoff.

4.1 Handoffs of IPv6-only MN	

   Table 2. List of handoffs of IPv6-only MN and mechanisms can be 
   applied to the communications with CNs.

   DS		DS		TR		NA6		
   --------------------------------------------------------- 
   TR  : Translator mechanisms such as SIIT and NAT-PT 
   NA6 : Native IPv6 

   For IPv6-only MN, there are four handoff scenarios. That is, from an 
   IPv6-only network to another IPv6-only network, from an IPv6-only 
   network to a DS network, from a DS network to an IPv6-only network, 
   and from a DS network to another DS network. Table 2 also lists all 
   handoff scenarios and mechanisms can be used for the communication 
   with CNs. While moving to a visited IPv6-only or DS network, IPv6-
   only MN can access the network and send MIPv6 messages to its home 
   agent to perform MIP registration. Then, the mobile node can be 
   reached via its IPv6 address even moving to a visited network. 
   Considering existing connections, IPv6- only and DS CNs can 
   communicate with the MN using native IPv6. As for IPv4-only CNs, 
   communication should go through the translators in the MN's home 
   network and then be tunneled to the visited network. In summary, 
   there is no problem introducing due to handoffs of IPv6-only MNs in 
   an IPv6-only or DS networks. 

4.2 Handoffs of IPv4-only MN

   applied to the communications with CNs.

                <draft-ietf-ngtrans-moving-00.txt>          <July, 2001> 

 
   For IPv4-only MN, there are four handoff scenarios. That is, from an 
   IPv4-only network to another IPv4-only network, from an IPv4-only 
   network to a DS network, from a DS network to an IPv4-only network, 
   and from a DS network to another DS network. Table 3 also lists all 
   handoff scenarios and mechanisms can be used for the communication 
   with CNs. The situations are quite similar as that of IPv6-only MN. 
   IPv4-only MN moves to a visited IPv4-only or DS network, and performs 
   MIPv4 registration. Regarding of existing connections, IPv4-only CNs 
   can communicate with MN using native IPv4. For communication between 
   MN and IPv6-only CNs, packets have to go to translators in the MN's 
   home network first and then be tunneled to the visited network. As 
   for DS CN, DS CN can use native IPv4 to talk to IPv4-only MN or 
   request an IPv4 address as well as Tunnel End Point (TEP) via DSTM[6] 
   and send IPv4 packets encapsulated in IPv6 to IPv4-only MN. In 
   summary, there is no new problem Introduced in this category.

4.3 Handoffs of DS MNv6

   Table 4. List of handoffs of DS MNv6 and mechanisms can be applied to 
   the communications with CNs. 
   --------------------------------------------------------------

   NA4  : Native IPv4

   (v4) : in IPv4-only network

   Table 4 also lists all handoff scenarios and mechanisms can be used 
   for the communication with CNs. For a DS MNv6, two sub-categories of 
   handoff are further classified. The first sub-category of handoff 
   includes DS MNv6 moving from an IPv6-only network to another IPv6-
   only network, from an IPv6-only network to a DS network, from a DS 
   network to an IPv6-only network, and from a DS network to another DS 
   network. This sub- category is very similar to that of IPv6-only MN 
   handoff. DS MNv6 can access IPv6-only and DS networks and perform 
   MIPv6 registration. The difference is the communication between MN 
   and IPv4-only CNs. Since MN is dual stack, MN can request an IPv4 
   address via DSTM and send IPv4 packets encapsulated in IPv6 to IPv4-
   only CNs through TEP. Then, translator is no more necessary. 


<Tsao, Tsirtsis, Boehm>       5                                   

                <draft-ietf-ngtrans-moving-00.txt>          <July, 2001> 
 
 
   Imagine a DS MNv6 that only performs MIPv6 registration and not 
   MIPv4. While stationary and at home the MN does not use its 
   MIPv6 capabilities and thus looks like a regular Dual Stack node. 
   In an environment like that, one of the most appealing 
   interoperability mechanisms proposed by the NGTRANS WG is called[6]. 

   DSTM allows a dual stack node to use DHCPv6 [8] to configure on 
   demand its IPv4 stack. This offers high utilization of IPv4 address 
   space and no requirements for IPv4 support in the domain. 
   Additionally, while the node has an IPv4 address, it can communicate 
   with IPv4-only nodes without the use of Protocol Translators and/or 
   Address Translators. 
   
   DSTM has been mainly designed for stationary dual stack nodes. We 
   will now examine how a DS MNv6 can take advantage of DSTM in a mobile 
   environment. It is clear that if the DS MNv6 is not moving, DSTM can 
   be directly applicable i.e., the DS MNv6 can use DHCPv6 over MIPv6 to 
   communicate with the DSTM server in the home network and request an 
   IPv4 address. The problem is that while MIPv6 can "move" the mobile's 
   IPv6 stack between access points in the network, it is not obvious 
   how it can move the IPv4 stack of the same DS MNv6. 
   
   [6] assumes that IPv4 routing is not available in the DSTM domain. 
   The Dynamic Tunneling Interface (DTI) is defined as an interface that 
   encapsulates IPv4 packets into IPv6 packets. The TEP is also defined 
   as the destination of the IPv6 packet containing an IPv4 packet. 
   Providing the DS MNv6 knows where the TEP is, in the domain it 
   happens to be in, it can use MIPv6 to send an encapsulated IPv4 
   packet to the IPv4-only CN. 
   
   DS MNv6 essentially uses its MIPv6 COA in the foreign domain to 
   request an IPv4 address (and the local TEP) from the local DHCPv6 
   server. It then uses MIPv6 to communicate with the local TEP and 
   encapsulate IPv4 packets destined to external IPv4-only nodes. Even 
   if DS MNv6 moves to a new Access Router in this domain, a BU to the 
   TEP will allow the IPv6 tunnel and the IPv4 packets it encapsulates 
   to be maintained. 
   
   Note that like [9] the level of IPv6 connectivity offered by the 
   above combination is very similar to MIPv4 without route optimization 
   since the IPv4 address used is in fact a dynamically allocated IPv4 
   Home Address. Also like [9], MIPv6 Route optimization is of course 
   used for the path between the MN and the TEP in that domain.      
   
   It might also be possible for the MN to use the Home DHCPv6 server 
   when in a foreign domain e.g: if the foreign domain does not support 
   DHCPv6. This would require DHCPv6 request to be sent through the Home 
   Agent of the MN. The reply would then include an IPv4 address   and a 
   TEP address from the home domain. Data would have to be sent from the 
   MN to the HA, then to the TEP and eventually to the CN.

                <draft-ietf-ngtrans-moving-00.txt>          <July, 2001> 

   
   Second sub-category of handoffs are DS MNv6 moving from an IPv6-only 
   network to an IPv4-only network, from an IPv4-only network to an 
   IPv6-only network, from an IPv4-only network to another IPv4-only 
   network, from an IPv4-only network to a DS network, and from a DS 
   network to an IPv4-only network. In this sub-category,  a MN that 
   registered an IPv6 address moves to an IPv4- only network. Suppose a 
   mobile node registers an IPv6 address and moves to an IPv4- only 
   network. The mobile node can still receive IPv6 packets from IPv4-
   only network if IPv4-only network implements 6over4 [10] on the 
   boundary routers. However, if IPv4-only network does not implement 
   6over4 mechanism, the mobile node cannot receive IPv6 packets. Since 
   the mobile node is IPv4/IPv6 dual stack, it receives foreign agent 
   advertisement messages from the IPv4 protocol stack. The MN detects 
   the movement to an IPv4-only network without 6over4. The MN asks for 
   a co-located IPv4 COA by certain mechanisms. 
   
   Once it has an IPv4 COA, it generates an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address 
   and also obtains the IPv4 address of its home agent located in IPv6 
   home network. The IPv4 COA can be obtained by DHCP or some other 
   dynamic address allocation schemes [4][8]. The address allocation 
   issue is out of the scope of this document. In this case, MIPv6 home 
   agent MUST broadcast its IPv6 as well as its IPv4 address by home 
   agent advertisement. Once MN received the HA advertisement, it MUST 
   keep both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses of its home agent. 
   
   After the MN has these addresses, it sends MIPv6 binding update (BU) 
   encapsulated in IPv4 packets to its home agent. Here, we assume that 
   home agent is IPv4/IPv6 dual stack. The IPv6 home agent decapsulates 
   the MIPv6 BU and updates the new COA of the mobile node.  
   
   Packets to the MN will go to the home agent first, and then be 
   tunneled to the visited network. The MN receives and decapsulates the 
   packets. The procedures are summarized as:

   o In IPv6-only network, IPv6 packets are received and processed by 
   IPv6 protocol stack on a mobile node. 

   o MN received home agent advertisement with HA's IPv4 and IPv6 
   addresses, it keeps both two addresses. 

   o The MN, which moves to an IPv4-only network without 6over4 support, 
   receives the agent advertisement from MIPv4 foreign agent via the 
   IPv4 protocol stack. 

   o The mobile node obtains an IPv4 COA by certain mechanisms. It 
   generates the IPv4-compatible IPv6 address. MN also has the IPv4 
   address of the MIPv6 home agent.

                <draft-ietf-ngtrans-moving-00.txt>          <July, 2001> 
 
 
  o The MN sends MIPv6 BU encapsulated in IPv4 packets to its home 
   agent. The home agent decapsulates the MIPv6 BU messages and updates 
   the COA of the mobile node. 

   o Packets to the mobile node will go to its home network, and then be 
   tunneled to the visited network. Then, packets are encapsulated in 
   IPv4 and sent to MN.  

   Regarding of moving to IPv6-only or DS networks from IPv4-only 
   networks, DS MNv6 releases IPv4 COA and registers a new IPv6 COA or 
   deregisters with its home agent.  

4.4 Handoffs of DS MNv4

   the communications with CNs.

   Table 5 also lists all handoff scenarios and mechanisms can be used 
   for the communication with CNs. For a DS MNv4, two sub-categories of 
   handoff are also classified. 
   
   First sub-category includes DS MNv4 moving from an IPv4-only network 
   to another IPv4-only network, from an IPv4-only network to a DS 
   network, from a DS network to an IPv4- only network, and from a DS 
   network to another DS network. This sub- category is very similar to 
   that of the IPv4-only MN handoff. DS MNs can access IPv4-only and DS 
   networks, and perform MIPv4 registration procedure to its IPv4 home 
   agent. The difference is the communication between MN and IPv6-only 
   CNs. Since MN is dual stack, MN can use its own IPv4- compatible IPv6 
   address to talk to IPv6-only CNs without introducing translators. 
   




<Tsao, Tsirtsis, Boehm>       8                                   

                <draft-ietf-ngtrans-moving-00.txt>          <July, 2001> 
 
   
   Second sub-category of handoffs are DS MNv4 moving from an IPv4-only 
   network to an IPv6-only network, from an IPv6-only network to an 
   IPv4-only network, from an IPv6-only network to another IPv6-only 
   network, from an IPv6-only network to a DS network, and from a DS 
   network to an IPv6-only network.    

   In this sub-category, a mobile node that registered an IPv4 address 
   as its home address moves to an IPv6-only network. If the IPv6-only 
   network supports DSTM [6], the mobile node can ask for a co-located 
   COA, obtain TEP, and then send MIPv4 registration request 
   encapsulated in IPv6 packets to its home agent. Then, the 
   registration procedure is complete. If the IPv6-only network does not 
   support DSTM, the DS MNv4 cannot receive IPv4 agent advertisement and 
   fails in the registration process to its home network. Since the 
   mobile node is IPv4/IPv6 dual stack, it still can receive router 
   advertisement from IPv6 routers in an IPv6-only network. 
   
   The MN detects no DSTM support but receives the IPv6 packets, it 
   realizes that it moves to an IPv6-only network. The IPv6 stack 
   generates an IPv6 COA by using subnet prefix of the visited network. 
   Once the mobile node obtains an IPv6 COA, it resolves an IPv4 address 
   by the IPv6 address and also obtains the IPv6 address of its IPv4 
   home agent. Here we assume that IPv4 home agent is also IPv4/IPv6 
   dual stack. The IPv6 COA and its mapped IPv4 address must be co-
   located addresses allocated by the visited network using any 
   mechanisms. The mapping between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses can be 
   obtained by issuing DNS queries.    
   
   The allocation of the COA in the visited network can be static 
   assignment or dynamic allocation. The generation of the IPv6 address 
   and the mapping of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are out of the scope of 
   this document. The related information can be found in [4][8]. 
   
   Since the home agent is IPv4/IPv6 dual stack, the mobile node has 
   IPv6 address of home agent, the MN can then tunnel MIPv4 registration 
   request message to its home agent. Home agent decapsulates the IPv6 
   packets, receives the registration message and update its care- of-
   address. Therefore, packets to the mobile node can be transmitted 
   with the new IPv4 COA. 
   
   The procedures for DS MNv4 which migrates from an IPv4-only network 
   to an IPv6-only network are summarized as:

   o In IPv4-only network, IPv4 packets are received and processed by 
   IPv4 protocol stack on a mobile node. 

   o The MN, which moves to an IPv6-only network, receives the router 
   advertisement from IPv6 router via the IPv6 protocol stack. 

   o  The MN requests an IPv4 address and TEP via DSTM. The MN then 
   sends MIPv4 registration request to its HA via TEP. Packets to MN 
   should go to the home agent first and then be tunneled to the visited 
   network.

   o  If MN can not requests an IPv4 address and TEP via DSTM. It 
   obtains an IPv6 COA by certain mechanisms in the visited network. It 
   resolves the IPv4 address by the IPv6 address, and obtains the IPv6 
   address of its home agent. The mechanisms to obtain an IPv6 care- of-
   address and the mapping between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses are out of 
   the scope of the document. 

   o The MN sends MIPv4 registration request encapsulated in IPv6 
   packets to IPv4 HA. HA updates the COA of the MN.

   o Packets to the MN are first routed to its home network. Home agent 
   tunnels the packets to the IPv4 COA. 

   Regarding of moving to IPv4-only or DS networks from IPv6-only 
   networks, DS MNv4 releases IPv6 COA and registers a new IPv4 COA or 
   deregisters with its home agent.  

5. Route optimization 
   
   For some specific handoffs, packet routing between CN and MN can be 
   further optimized. Here, IPv4-only CN is assumed to implement route 
   optimization for MIPv4. 
   
   First case is DS MNv6 moves from an IPv6-only network to another 
   IPv6-only network while communicating with an IPv4-only CN. While DS 
   MN moves to the visited network with DSTM support, DS MN uses its 
   MIPv6 COA in the foreign domain to request an IPv4 address and the 
   local TEP from the local DHCPv6 server. It then uses MIPv6 to 
   communicate with the local TEP and encapsulate IPv4 packets destined 
   to external IPv4-only nodes. Then, DS MN can send MIPv4 binding 
   update encapsulated in IPv6 packet to IPv4-only CN. If IPv4-only CN 
   supports route optimization, it will refresh its binding update list 
   and send packets to MN via new TEP. Thus, packet routing between CN 
   and MN is optimized. 
   
   Another situation is that DS MNv6 moves from IPv6-only network to 
   IPv4-only network while communicating with an IPv4-only CN. In this 
   case, DS MN will use native IPv4 to talk to CN and send MIPv4 binding 
   update to CN after moving to the visited network. The packets need 
   not go through home TEP so that routing can be also optimized. 
   
   Considering another scenario that a DS MNv6, talks to an IPv6-only or 
   DS CN. The MN changes its point of attachment to an IPv4-only 
   network. If the visited network supports 6over4 [3] on the boundary 
   routers, the MN can act as normal IPv6- only MN, and update binding 
   information to its home agent and IPv6- only CNs. If the visited 
   network does not support 6over4, mechanisms presented above show the 
   procedures to request an IPv4 COA and register the IPv4-compatible 
   IPv6 address to its home agent.

  Regarding of packets from IPv6-only CNs to the MN, they go to the home 
  network first, and be tunneled to the MN. To optimize routing, the MN 
  can send MIPv6 BU messages to IPv6 CNs to update their binding 
  information. However, the visited network is IPv4-only and no TEP is 
  available. To solve this problem, the MN can send MIPv6 BU to IPv6-
  only CNs via reverse tunneling. That is, MIPv6 BU is tunneled to its 
  home agent first and then sent to IPv6-only CNs. CNs can try to obtain 
  a tunneling server by tunnel broker mechanisms [13] or obtain a pre-
  configured router [11][12], and send packets to the TEP. The TEP 
  encapsulates the packets and sends to the MN. Thus, the routing 
  between TEP/MN, and TEP/CN are both optimized. 
   
   Suppose a DS MNv4. The MN changes its point of attachment to an IPv6-
   only network. The MN node requests an IPv4 COA by using DSTM[6] or 
   the mechanisms presented above. It then can perform MIPv4 
   registration to its home agent. For the incoming packets from IPv4-
   only CNs, they go to the home agent first, and then be tunneled to 
   the MN. However, triangle routing is introduced in this scenario even 
   MIPv4 route optimization is implemented. To optimize routing, MN can 
   send MIPv4 BU messages to IPv4 CNs. Since MN is in an IPv6-only 
   network, the MIPv4 BU is encapsulated in IPv6 packets to CNs via 
   TEPs. TEP decapsulates packets and then forwards the IPv4 packets to 
   IPv4-only CNs. Once the IPv4-only CNs get the MIPv4 BU, they send 
   packets with the new IPv4 COA address which belongs to the visited 
   network. Thus, the routing between TEP/MN, and TEP/CN are both 
   optimized.
