1.  Introduction

   [RFC8655] introduces and explains Deterministic Networks (DetNet)
   architecture.

   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) protocols are used
   to detect, localize defects in the network, and monitor network
   performance.  Some OAM functions, e.g., failure detection, work in
   the network proactively, while others, e.g., defect localization,
   usually performed on-demand.  These tasks achieved by a combination
   of active and hybrid, as defined in [RFC7799], OAM methods.

   [I-D.tpmb-detnet-oam-framework] lists the functional requirements
   toward OAM for DetNet domain.  The list can further be used for gap
   analysis of available OAM tools to identify possible enhancements of
   existing or whether new OAM tools are required to support proactive
   and on-demand path monitoring and service validation.  Also, the
   document defines the OAM use principals for the DetNet networks with
   the IP data plane.

2.  Conventions used in this document

2.1.  Terminology

   The term "DetNet OAM" used in this document interchangeably with
   longer version "set of OAM protocols, methods and tools for
   Deterministic Networks".

   DetNet Deterministic Networks

   DiffServ Differentiated Services

   OAM: Operations, Administration and Maintenance

   PREF Packet Replication and Elimination Function

   POF Packet Ordering Function

   RDI Remote Defect Indication

   ICMP Internet Control Message Protocol

   Underlay Network or Underlay Layer: The network that provides
   connectivity between the DetNet nodes.  MPLS network providing LSP
   connectivity between DetNet nodes is an example of the underlay
   layer.

   DetNet Node - a node that is an actor in the DetNet domain.  DetNet
   domain edge node and node that performs PREF within the domain are
   examples of DetNet node.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Active OAM for DetNet Networks with the IP Data Plane

   OAM protocols and mechanisms act within the data plane of the
   particular networking layer.  And thus it is critical that the data
   plane encapsulation supports OAM mechanisms in such a way that DetNet
   OAM packets are in-band with a DetNet flow being monitored, i.e.,
   DetNet OAM test packets follow precisely the same path as DetNet data
   plane traffic both for unidirectional and bi-directional DetNet
   paths.

Internet-Draft           OAM for DetNet over IP               March 2021


   The DetNet data plane encapsulation in a transport network with IP
   encapsulations specified in Section 6 of [RFC8939].  For the IP
   underlay network, DetNet flows are identified by the ordered match to
   the provisioned information set that, among other elements, includes
   the IP protocol, source port number, destination port number.  Active
   IP OAM protocols like Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
   [RFC5880] or STAMP [RFC8762], use UDP transport and the well-known
   UDP port numbers as the destination port.  Thus a DetNet node MUST be
   able to associate an IP DetNet flow with the particular test session
   to ensure that test packets experience the same treatment as the
   DetNet flow packets.

   Most of on-demand failure detection and localization in IP networks
   is being done by using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
   Echo Request, Echo Reply and the set of defined error messages, e.g.,
   Destination Unreachable, with the more detailed information provided
   through code points.  [RFC0792] and [RFC4443] define the ICMP for
   IPv4 and IPv6 networks, respectively.  Because ICMP is another IP
   protocol like, for example, UDP, a DetNet node MUST able to associate
   an ICMP packet generated by the specified IP DetNet node and
   addressed to the another IP DetnNet node with an IP DetNet flow
   between this pair of endpoints.

3.1.  Active OAM Using DetNet-in-UDP Encapsulation

   Active OAM in IP DetNet can be realized using DetNet-in-UDP
   encapsulation [Ed.note: Do we define it in this document or start a
   new one?].  Using DetNet-in-UDP tunnel between IP DetNet nodes
   ensures that active OAM test packets are fate-sharing with the
   monitored IP DetNet flow packets.  As a result, a test packet shares
   the tunnel with the IP DetNet flow and shares the fate, statistically
   speaking, of the IP DetNet flow being monitored.

3.2.  Mapping Active OAM and IP DetNet flows

   IP OAM protocols that use UDP transport, e.g., BFD and STAMP, can be
   used to detect failures or performance degradation that affects an IP
   DetNet flow.  When the UDP destination port number used by the OAM
   protocol is one of the assigned by IANA, then the UDP source port can
   be used to achieve co-routedness of OAM, and the monitored IP DetNet
   flow in the multipath environments, e.g., LAG or ECMP.  To maximize
   the accuracy of OAM results in detecting failures and monitoring
   performance of IP DetNet, test packets should receive the same
   treatment by the nodes as experienced by the IP DetNet packet.
   Hence, the DSCP value used for a test packet MUST be mapped to
   DetNet.

3.3.  Active OAM Using GRE-in-UDP Encapsulation

   [RFC8086] has defined the method of encapsulating GRE (Generic
   Routing Encapsulation) headers in UDP.  GRE-in-UDP encapsulation can
   be used for IP DetNet OAM as it eases the task of mapping an OAM test
   session to a particular IP DetNet flow that is identified by N-tuple.
   Matching a GRE-in-UDP tunnel to the monitored IP DetNet flow enables
   the use of Y.1731/G.8013 [ITU-T.1731] as a comprehensive toolset of
   OAM.  The Protocol Type field in GRE header MUST be set to 0x8902
   assigned by IANA to IEEE 802.1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM)
   Protocol / ITU-T Recommendation Y.1731.  Y.1731/G.8013 supports
   necessary for IP DetNet OAM functions, i.e., continuity check, one-
   way packet loss and packet delay measurement.

4.  OAM of DetNet IP Interworking with OAM of non-IP DetNet domains

   A domain in which IP data plane provides DetNet service could be used
   in conjunction with a TSN and a DetNet domain with MPLS data plane to
   deliver end-to-end service.  In such scenarios, the ability to detect
   defects and monitor performance using OAM is essential.
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls-oam] identified two OAM interworking models -
   peering and tunneling.  Interworking between DetNet domains with IP
   and MPLS data planes analyzed in Section 6.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls-oam].  Also, requirements and recommendations
   for OAM interworking between a DetNet domain with MPLS data plane and
   OAM of a TSN equally apply to a DetNet domain with an IP data plane.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not have any requests for IANA allocation.  This
   section can be deleted before the publication of the draft.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the applicability of the existing Fault
   Management and Performance Monitoring IP OAM protocols, and does not
   raise any security concerns or issues in addition to ones common to
   networking or already documented for the referenced DetNet and OAM
   protocols.
