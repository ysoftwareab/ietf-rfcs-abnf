INTERNET DRAFT               Historic RFCs                 March 2, 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Historic RFC maturity was firstly mentioned in RFC 1310
   [RFC1310], the first document that defined IETF standards process,
   and its definition remained unchanged in all its revisions - RFC 1602
   [RFC1602] and the most current RFC 2026 [RFC2026].  It just says:

     A specification that has been superseded by a more recent
     specification or is for any other reason considered to be obsolete
     is assigned to the "Historic" level.

   This description remains many issues opened and uncertain.  They
   include: criteria for Historic RFCs, procedures for republication and
   reclassification of RFCs in Historic maturity level, references to
   Historic RFCs, etc.  This caused misunderstandings of the community
   regarding such issues and often using ad-hoc and often undefined
   procedures for them.

   This document is to clarify the Historic maturity level and other
   issues related to it.  It updates RFC 2026 [RFC2026].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   The definitions of RFC streams, i. e. IETF stream, IAB stream, IRTF
   stream and Independent Submissions stream, can be found in RFC 4844
   [RFC4844].

   The terms 'Standards Action' and 'IETF Consensus' are described in
   Section 4.1 of RFC 5226 [RFC5226]

   The term 'historicizing RFC' means the RFC that makes another one
   Historic.  The term 'historicized RFC' means the RFC that is made
   Historic by another one.  The term 'superseding RFC' means the RFC
   that replaces another one.  The term 'superseded RFC' means the RFC
   that is replaced by another one.

1.2. Discussion of this Document

   Discussion of this document SHALL occure on IETF Discussion mailing
   list [RFC3005] until and unless any of the ADs will create the
   separate list.  This section MUST be deleted upon publication of this
   document.

2.  Historic Status Definition

   The Historic maturity is used to identify that the particular RFC is
   obsolete (i.e. outdated), superseded or deprecated.  The criteria the
   RFC should meet to be considered as obsolete, superseded or
   deprecated are discussed in Section 2.1.  

   Historic RFC maturity level is a kind of caveat emptor, that notifies
   the reader that they SHOULD be careful with the implementation of the
   described technology since it is not advised to be used for some
   reason.  But Historic maturity level does NOT restrict any
   implementations of the described technology.

   The Historic status MAY be assigned to RFCs of all categories
   following the procedures of Section 3 of this document.

2.1. Criteria for Historic RFCs

   If the RFC is replaced by another one, it SHALL be considered to be
   superseded.

   The RFC SHALL be considered to be obsolete if it meets the following
   criteria:

     a. It has been publicly available for at least 7 years; 

     b. During this period of time the protocol or technology, described
     in this RFC has not been seen used in the Internet (i. e. no
     interoperable implementations have appeared during this time) or it
     has been implemented early in the process of testing of this
     technology, but further implementations have not appeared.

   The RFC SHALL be considered to be deprecated if it meets at least one
   of the following criteria:

     a. There is another technology, that, in fact, does not supersedes
     the technology described in such RFC, but just provides more
     aceptable alternative, and, therefore, makes it 'predecessor' NOT
     RECOMMENDED to be used;

     b. The technology, described in it contains a design flaw or
     provides some risk of danger to the Internet and SHOULD be avoided;

     c. It described the technology that might create serious problems
     with its implementation or makes them impossible.

3.  Procedures for Historic RFCs

   There are two different ways the Historic RFC may put itself on the
   map.  They are:

     a. Republication of RFC as Historic; and

     b. Reclassification of RFC as Historic.

   The procedures for these two cases are described below.

3.1. Republication of RFC as Historic

   One way to make the RFC Historic is to republish it in this status. 
   If such action is needed, the appropriate Internet-Draft with the
   intended status 'Historic' and that will become the superseding
   document for the historicized one (when approved) SHALL be issued. 
   The technical content of this Internet-Draft MUST be the same as in
   the historicized RFC.  Such document SHALL contain the 'Historic
   Considerations' section clarifying the reason of republication the
   document in Historic maturity level.

   Such republication proposal SHALL firstly be discussed at the
   appropriate mailing list, if any, or on the IETF Discussion mailing
   list [RFC3005].  If the authors are sure that there is at least rough
   consensus on such action, they should apply to IESG to request the
   IETF-wide Last Call for republication the particular document in
   Historic maturity level.  If the Last Call revealed the wide
   consensus of the community, the corresponding RFC will be republished
   as Historic document.

   There are a number of cases when the approval of another parties is
   needed for republication of RFC in Historic maturity level.  In
   particular, if the historicized document has been processed on IAB
   Stream, the approval of IAB Chair [RFC2850] is REQUIRED for
   historicizing such document.  If the document has been processed on
   IRTF or Independent Submissions Streams, the approval of IRTF Chair
   [RFC2014] or the authors of the document (or the directors of the
   area the document is considered to be related to, in exceptional
   cases), respectively, is REQUIRED for moving such document to
   Historic.

3.2. Reclassification of RFC as Historic

   Reclassification of RFC as Historic is made via moving it to this
   status from the other one.  There are two possibilities for such
   action:

INTERNET DRAFT               Historic RFCs                 March 2, 2011


     a. There is a superseding RFC that moves the superseded one to
     Historic maturity level; and

     b. There is a separate historicizing RFC that moves the
     historicized one to Historic maturity level.

   The procedures for moving RFCs to Historic, depending on their
   initial status are described below.  For examples of the RFCs that
   perform such action see RFC 4223 [RFC4223] or RFC 5125 [RFC5125].

3.2.1. Standards Track RFCs

   Historicizing of Standards Track RFCs SHALL be made following the
   'IETF Consensus' policies.  

3.2.2. Best Current Practices RFCs

   Best Current Practices (BCP) [RFC1818] RFC MAY be historicized only
   in the case if it is being superseded by the other one.  In this case
   the usual procedure for BCP RFCs SHALL be followed [RFC2026].

3.2.3. Experimental RFCs

   Procedures for historicizing Experimental RFCs depend on their origin
   and the way it is being historicized, as follows.

3.2.3.1. Separate Historicizing Document

   The procedures described in this section apply to the case, mentioned
   as 'b' at the beginning of Section 3.2 (separate historicizing
   document).

   If the Experimental RFCs has been processed on IETF stream, 'IETF
   Consensus' is REQUIRED to historicize it.

   If the Experimental RFCs has been processed on IAB stream, 'IETF
   Consensus' and IAB Chair [RFC2850] approval is REQUIRED to
   historicize it.

   If the Experimental RFCs has been processed on IRTF stream, 'IETF
   Consensus' and IRTF Chair [RFC2014] approval is REQUIRED to
   historicize it.

   If the Experimental RFCs has been processed on Independent
   Submissions stream, 'IETF Consensus' and authors' approval is
   REQUIRED to historicize it.  In exceptional cases the approval of the
   director of the area the historicized document is considered to be
   related to MAY be used instead the authors' one.

INTERNET DRAFT               Historic RFCs                 March 2, 2011


   In the cases described above IESG is responsible for recording their
   approval.

3.2.3.2. Superseding Document Historicizes the Superseded One

   The procedures described in this section apply to the case, mentioned
   as 'a' at the beginning of Section 3.2 (superseding document
   historicizes the superseded one).

   The superseding document that is being processed only on the same
   stream as the superseded one MAY historicize it.  A simple mention of
   such action is therefore REQUIRED in superseding document.

3.2.4. Informational RFCs

   In order to consider the Informational RFC to be appropriate for
   assigning it the Historic maturity level, it SHALL meet the following
   criteria:

     a. It describes the protocol or other technology (see Section 4.2.2
     of RFC 2026 [RFC2026]);

     b. It is not a part of FYI sub-series [RFC1150]; and

     c. It meets the criteria of Section 2 of this document.

   The procedures for historicizing such RFCs are the same as for
   Experimental ones, described in Section 3.2.3.

3.2.5. RFCs with No Particular Status

   RFCs with no particular status (see [RFCNOSTATUS]) SHALL be moved to
   Historic following the 'IETF Consensus' policies.

4.  Other Considerations

4.1. 'Status of this Memo' Section in Historic RFCs

   This document does not modify the boilerplates for 'Status of this
   Memo' sections in Historic RFCs described in RFC 5741 [RFC5741].

4.2. Handling References to Historic RFCs

   Normative references to Historic RFCs SHALL be handled as described
   in RFC 3967 [RFC3967].

   Informative references to Historic RFCs are allowed in any RFCs.

4.3. IANA Considerations in Historic RFCs

   The historicized document may have requested some action from IANA,
   that are already performed.  In this case the historicizing document
   MUST clearly mention whether any action from IANA is needed once such
   document becomes Historic.

   [DISCUSS: Are there any other issues related to Historic docs. that
   should be discussed here?]


5.  Security Considerations

   Security issues are not discussed in this document.


6.  IANA Considerations

   None.  This section may be deleted.


7.  Varying Procedure

   Varying procedure described in RFC 2026 [RFC2026] still applies to
   this document.
