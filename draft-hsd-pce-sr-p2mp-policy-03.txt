                   PCEP extensions for p2mp sr policy
                    draft-hsd-pce-sr-p2mp-policy-03

Abstract

   SR P2MP policies are set of policies that enable architecture for
   P2MP service delivery.  This document specifies extensions to the
   Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) that allow a
   stateful PCE to compute and initiate P2MP paths from a Root to a set
   of Leaves.

1.  Introduction

   The draft [draft-ietf-pim-sr-p2mp-policy] defines a variant of the SR
   Policy [draft-ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] for constructing a
   P2MP segment to support multicast service delivery.

   A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Policy connects a Root node to a set of
   Leaf nodes, optionally through a set of intermediate replication
   nodes.  A Replication segment
   [draft-ietf-spring-sr-replication-segment], which corresponds to the
   state of a P2MP segment on a particular node which provide forwarding
   instructions for the segment.

   A P2MP Policy is relevant on the root of the P2MP Tree and it
   contains candidate paths.  The candidate paths are made of path-
   instances and each path-instance is constructed via replication
   segments.  These replication segments are programmed on the root,
   leaves and optionally intermediate replication nodes.

   A replication segments MAY be connected directly, or they MAY be
   connected or steered via unicast SR segment or a segment list.

   For a P2MP Tree, a controller may be used to compute paths from a
   Root node to a set of Leaf nodes, optionally via a set of replication
   nodes.  A packet is replicated at the root node and optionally on
   Replication nodes towards each Leaf node.

   There are two types of a P2MP Tree: Spray and Replication.

   A Point-to-Multipoint service delivery could be via Ingress
   Replication, known as Spray.  The root unicasts individual copies of
   traffic to each leaf.  The corresponding P2MP Policy consists of
   replication segments only for the root and the leaves and they are
   connected via a unicast SR Segment.

   A Point-to-Multipoint service delivery could also be via Downstream
   Replication, known as Replication.  The root and some downstream
   replication nodes replicate the traffic along the way as it traverses
   closer to the leaves.

   The leaves and the root can be explicitly configured on the PCE or
   PCC can update the PCE with the information of the discovered root
   and leaves.  As an example Multicast protocols like MVPN procedures
   [RFC6513] or PIM can be used to discovery the leaves and roots on the
   PCC and update the PCE with these relevant information.  The
   controller can calculate the P2MP Policy and any of its associated
   replication segments with these info.

   This document defines PCEP objects, TLVs and the procedures to
   instantiate a P2MP Policy and Replication Segments.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Overview of PCEP Operation in SR P2MP Network

   After discovering the root and the leaves on the PCE (via different
   mechanism mentioned in previous sections), the PCE computes the P2MP
   Tree and identifying the relevant Replication routers, then it
   programs the PCCs with relevant information needed to create a P2MP
   Tree.

   As per draft [draft-ietf-pim-sr-p2mp-policy] a P2MP Policy is defined
   by Root-ID, Tree-ID and a set of leaves.  A P2MP policy is a variant
   of SR policy as such it uses the same concept as draft
   [draft-ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp].  A P2MP policy is
   composed of a collection of SR P2mp Candidate Paths.  Candidate paths
   are computed by the PCE and can be used for P2MP Tree redundancy.
   Only a single candidate path may be active at each time.  Each
   candidate paths can be globally optimized, therefore it is consists
   of multiple path-instances.  A path-instance can be considered to a
   P2MP LSP.  If a candidate path needs to be globally optimized two
   path-instances can be programmed on the root node and via make before
   break procedures the candidate path can be switched from path-

   instance 1 to the 2nd path-instance.  The forwarding states of these
   path-instances are build via replication segments, in short each
   path-instance initiated on the root has its own set of replication
   segments on the Root, Transit and Leaf nodes.

   A replication segment is set of forwarding instructions on a specific
   node.  Each instruction may be a PUSH or SWAP operation before
   forwarding out of an interface, or a POP action on bud and leaf
   nodes.

   PCE could also calculate and download additional information for the
   replication segments, such as protections next-hops for link
   protection (FRR).

3.1.  High level view of P2MP Policy Objects

   o  SR P2MP Policy

      *  Is only relevant on the Root of the P2MP path and is a policy
         on PCE.  It is downloaded only on the rootnode and is
         identified via <Root-ID, Tree-ID> It contains the following
         information:

         +  Root node of the P2MP Segment

         +  Leaf nodes of the P2MP Segment

         +  Tree-ID, which is a unique identifier of the P2MP tree on
            the Root

         +  A set of Candidate paths belonging to the policy

         +  Optional Constraints used to build these candidate paths

   o  Candidate Path:

      *  Is used for P2MP Tree redundancy where the candidate path with
         the highest preference is the active path.

      *  It can contain two path-instance for global optimization
         procedures (i.e. make before break)

      *  Contains information regarding protocol-id, originator,
         discriminator, preference, path-instances

   o  Replication Segment:

Internet-Draft             PCEP p2mp sr policy                  May 2021


      *  Is the forwarding information needed on each node for building
         the forwarding path for each path-instance of the P2MP
         Candidate path.

      *  Explained further in upcoming sections, there are 2 ways to
         identify the replication segment, depending if they are shared
         and non-shared

         +  It is identified via Tree-ID and Root-ID and path-instance
            for non-shared replication segment.

         +  It is identified via Node-ID, Replication-ID, for shared
            replication segment

         +  Contains forwarding instructions, in the form of a list of
            outgoing segments each of which may be a list

         +  On the forwarding plane the Replication Segment is
            identified via the incoming Replication SID.

         +  Replication segment information is downloaded on Root,
            Transit and Leaf nodes respectively.

3.1.1.  Shared Tree vs Non-Shared Replication Segment

   A non-shared Replication Segment is used when the label field of the
   PMSI Tunnel Attribute (PTA) is set to zero as per
   [draft-parekh-bess-mvpn-sr-p2mp].  This is used when there is no
   upstream assigned label in the PTA (provider tunnel attribute) and
   aggregate of MVPNs into a single P-Tunnel is not desired.

   An alternative shared Replication Segment is used when the label
   field of the PTA is not set to Zero and there is an upstream assigned
   label in the PTA.  In this case multiple MVPNs (VRFs) can be
   aggregate into a single Provider Tunnel and the upstream assigned
   label distinguishes the MVPNs context.

   It should be noted that the shared Replication Segment can also be
   used to build a bypass tunnel for the purpose of fast re-route.  This
   might be desirable if the bypass tunnel is build via the PCE and
   downloaded to the PCC for link protection.  In doing so, multiple
   non-shared Replication Segments can use the shared replication
   segment as their bypass tunnel for link protection.  The replication
   segments used in this bypass tunnel should only create a unicast
   bypass tunnel to protect the link between two replication segments on
   the primary path.

3.2.  Existing drafts used for defining a P2MP Policy

   This document attempts to leverage existing IETF draft and RFC
   documents which define PCEP objects, to update the PCE with Root and
   Leaves information when PCC Initiated method is used.  Similarly,
   existing documents are utilized where feasible to update the PCC with
   relevant information to build the P2MP Policy and its Replication
   Segments.  This document introduces new TLVs and Objects specific to
   a programing P2MP policy and its replication segment.

3.2.1.  Existing Documents used by this draft

   o  [RFC8231] The bases for a stateful PCE, and reuses the following
      objects or a variant of them

      *  <SRP Object>

      *  <LSP Object>

      *  A variation of the LSP identifier TLV is defined in this draft,
         to support P2MP LSP Identifier

   o  [RFC8236] P2MP capabilities advertisement

   o  [draft-ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp] Candidate paths for
      P2MP Policy is used for Tree Redundancy.  As an example, a P2MP
      Policy can have multiple candidate paths.  Each protecting the
      primary candidate path.  The active path is chosen via the
      preference of the candidate path.

   o  [RFC3209] Defines the instance-ID, instance-ID is used for global
      optimization of a candidate path with in a P2MP policy.  Each
      Candidate path can have 2 path-instances.  These path-instances
      are equivalent to sub-lsps (instance-IDs).  There are used for MBB
      and global optimization procedures.  instance-ID is equivalent to
      LSP ID

   o  [draft-ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] Segment-list, used for
      connecting two non-adjacent replication policy via a unicast
      binding SID or Segment-list.

   o  [RFC8306] P2MP End Point objects, used for the PCC to update the
      PCE with discovered Leaves.

   o  [draft-ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] for programming
      and identifying the Replication Segment.  A new PCE CC Capability
      sub Tlv is introduced to indicated the support to handle PCE CC
      based label download for SR P2MP.

Internet-Draft             PCEP p2mp sr policy                  May 2021


   o  [draft-ietf-pce-multipath] Forwarding instruction for a P2MP LSP
      is defined by a set of SR-ERO sub-objects in the ERO object, ERO-
      ATTRIBUTES object and MULTIPATH-BACKUP TLV as defined in this
      draft.

   o  [RFC8664] SR-ERO Sub Object used in the multipath.

   It should be noted that the [draft-dhs-spring-sr-p2mp-policy-yang]
   can provide further details of the high level P2MP Policy Model.

3.2.2.  P2MP Policy Identification

   A P2MP Policy and its candidate path can be identified on the root
   via the P2MP LSP Object.  This Object is a variation of the LSP ID
   Object defined in [RFC8231] and is as follow:

   o  PLSP-ID: [RFC8231], is assigned by PCC and is unique per candidate
      path.  It is constant for the lifetime of a PCEP session.  Stand-
      by candidate paths will be assigned a new PLSP-ID by PCC.  Stand-
      by candidate paths can co-exist with the active candidate path.

      *  Note: Every candidate path in the SR-P2MP Policy is unique with
         its own unique PLSP-ID and Instance-ID.  But the same Tree-ID
         is used for all candidate paths as they are part of the same
         P2MP Tree.

   o  Root-ID: is equivalent to the first node on the P2MP path, as per
      [RFC3209], Section 4.6.2.1

   o  Tree-ID: is equivalent to Tunnel Identifier color which identifies
      a unique P2MP Policy at a ROOT and is advertised via the PTA in
      the BGP AD route or can be assigned manually on the root.  Tree-ID
      needs to be unique on the root.

   o  Instance-ID: LSP ID Identifier as defined in RFC 3209, is the
      path-instance identifier and is assigned by the PCC.  As it was
      mentioned the candidate path can have up to two path-instance for
      global optimization.  Note that the Root-ID, Tree-ID and Instance-
      ID are part of a new SR- P2MP-LSP-IDENTIFIER TLV which will be
      identified in this draft.

      *  Note: each Path-instance on the Root node is assigned a unique
         Instance-ID

3.2.3.  Replication Segment Identification

   The key to identify a replication segment is also a P2MP LSP Object.
   With varying encoding rules for the SR-P2MP-LSP- IDENTIFIER TLV which
   will be explained in later sections.

3.2.4.  PCECC Use in Replication Segment

   PCECC and a variant of CCI object is used in Replication Segment to
   identify a cross connect.  A cross connect is a incoming SID and set
   of outgoing interfaces and their corresponding SID.  The CCI objects
   contains the incoming SID while the outgoing interfaces are presented
   via the ERO objects, which each may contain a list of segments.

3.3.  High Level Procedures for P2MP SR LSP Instantiation

   A P2MP policy can be instantiated via the PCC or the PCE depending on
   how the root and the leaves are discovered.  This document describes
   two way to discover the root and the leaves:

   o  They can be configured and identified on the controller and are
      considered PCE initiated.

   o  They can be discovered on the PCC via MVPN procedures [RFC6513] or
      legacy multicast protocols like PIM or IGMP etc... and are
      considered PCC initiated.

3.3.1.  PCE-Init Procedure

   o  PCE is informed of the P2MP request through its API or
      configuration mechanism to instantiate a P2MP tunnel.

   o  PCE will initiate the P2MP Policy for the request, by sending a
      PCInitiate message to the Root.

   o  Root in response to the PCInitiate message, will generate PLSP-ID
      for the candidate paths and an Instance-ID for the Path-Instance
      (LSP-ID) contained with in the candidate path.  The tree-id for
      the P2MP Policy is also filled.  PCC will reports back the PLSP-
      ID, Instance-ID and tree-id via PCRpt message

      *  Optionally, the Root can add any additional leaves that were
         discovered by multicast procedures in this PCRpt message.

   o  PCE will send a PCInitiate message to the Root, Transit and the
      Leaf nodes to download the Replication Segment information.  These
      messages will utilize the CCI object to encode the forwarding
      instruction information.

   o  PCE will then send a PCUpdate to the root indicating the
      association information (Candidate path) , and implicitly indicate
      it to bind to the latest CCI information downloaded.

3.3.2.  PCC-Init Procedure

   After Root (PCC) discovers the leaves (as an example via MVPN
   Procedures or other mechanism), the following communication happens
   between the PCE and PCCs

   o  Root sends a PCRpt message for P2MP policy to PCE including the
      Root-ID, Tree-ID, PLSP-ID, Instance-ID, symbolic-path-name, and
      any leaves discovered until then.

   o  PCE on receiving of this report, will compute the P2MP Policy and
      its replication segments.

      *  PCE will send a PCInitiate message to the Root, Transit and the
         Leaf nodes to download the Replication Segment information.
         These messages will utilize the CCI object to encode the
         forwarding instruction information.

      *  PCE will then send a PCUpdate to the root indicating the
         association information (Candidate path) , and implicitly
         indicate it to bind to the latest CCI information downloaded.

3.3.3.  Common Procedure

   The following procedures are the same for PCE or PCC Init.

   o  PCE will download the replication segments for the Candidate-
      path's path-instances to all the leaves and transit nodes using
      PCInitiate message with PLSP-ID = 0, Instance-ID =0, symbolic path
      name, Root-address, Tree-id(assigned by the root).  This
      PCInitiate message includes the EROs needed for the replication
      segments.  These messages will utilize the CCI object to encode
      the forwarding instruction information.

   o  Any new candidate path for the P2MP Policy is downloaded by PCE to
      the Root by sending a PCInitiate message

      *  it should be noted, PLSP-ID, Path-Instance ID and the Tree-ID
         are generated by the PCC for these new candidate paths and
         their Path-instances

      *  Any update to the Candidate Paths or Replication Segments is
         done via the PCUpd message.  Association object need to be

         present for Candidate Path updates and CCI object for the
         replication segment updates.

   o  The PCE will also download the necessary replication segment for
      the candidate path and its path-instances to the root, leaves and
      the transit nodes via a PCInit message

   o  New leaves can be discovered via Multicast procedures, and new
      replication segments can be instantiated or existing one updated
      to reach these leaves

      *  If these leaves reside on routers that are part of the P2MP LSP
         path, then PCUpd is sent from PCE to necessary PCCs (LEAVES,
         TRANSIT or ROOT) with the correct PLSP-ID, Instance-ID, Tree-ID
         and CC-ID.

      *  If the new leaves are residing on routers that are not part of
         the P2MP Tree yet, then a PCInitiate message is sent down with
         PLSP- ID=0 and Instance-ID=0 on the corresponding routers.

   o  The active candidate-path is indicated by the PCC through the
      operational bits(Up/Active) of the LSP object in the PCRpt
      message.  If a candidate path needs to be removed, PCE sends PC
      Initiate message, setting the R-flag in the LSP object and R bit
      in the SRP-object.

   o  To remove the entire P2MP-LSP, PCE needs to send PCInitiate remove
      messages for every candidate path of the P2MP POLICY to the root
      and send PCInitiate remove messages for every Replication Regment
      on all the PCCs on the P2MP Tree.  The R bit in the LSP Object as
      defined in [RFC8231], refers to the removal of the LSP as
      identified by the SR-P2MP-POLICY-ID-TLV (defined in this
      document).  An all zero (SR-P2MP-LSP-ID-TLV defines to remove all
      the state of the corresponding PLSP-ID.

   o  A candidate path is made active based on the preference of the
      path.  If the Root is programed with multiple candidate paths from
      different sources, as an example PCE and CLI, based on its tie-
      breaking rules, if it selects the CLI path, it will send a report
      to PCE for the PCE path indicating the status of label-download
      and sets operational bit of the LSP object to UP and Not Active .
      At any instance, only one path will be active

3.3.4.  Global Optimization of the Candidate Path

   When a P2MP LSP needs to be optimized for any reason (i.e. it is
   taking a FRR tunnel or new routers are added to the network) a global
   optimization of the candidate path is possible.



Bidgoli, et al.         Expires November 26, 2021              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft             PCEP p2mp sr policy                  May 2021


   Each Candidate Path can contain two Path-Instances.  The current
   unoptimized Path-Instance is the active instance and its replication
   segments are forwarding the multicast PDUs from the root to the
   leaves.  However the second optimized Path-Instance will be setup
   with its own unique replication segments throughout the network, from
   the Root to the leaves.  These two Path-Instances can co-exist.  The
   two Path-Instances are uniquely identified by their Instance-ID in
   the SR-P2MP-POLICY-ID-TLV (defined in this document).  After the
   optimized LSP has been downloaded successfully PCC MUST send two
   reports, reporting UP of the new path indicating the new LSP-ID, and
   a second reporting the tear down of the old path with the R bit of
   the LSP Object SET with the old Instance-ID in the SR-P2MP-POLICY-ID-
   TLV.  This MBB procedure will move the multicast PDUs to the
   optimized Path-Instance.

   The leaf should be able to accept traffic from both Path-Instances to
   minimize the traffic outage by the Make Before Break process.

3.3.5.  Fast Reroute

   Currently this draft identifies the Facility FRR procedures.  In
   addition, only LINK Protection procedures are defined.  How the
   Facility Path is built and instantiated is beyond the scope of this
   document.

   As an example, the bypass path (unicast bypass) between the PLR and
   MP can be constructed via SR or even via a shared tree (replication
   segment).

   As an example, in figure 1 the detour path between R and T is the 2nd
   fiber between these nodes.  As such the bypass path could be setup on
   the 2nd fiber.  That said in figure 2 the bypass path is traversing
   multiple nodes and this example a unicast SR path might be ideal for
   setting up the detour path.

   In addition, PHP procedure and implicit null label on the bypass path
   can be implemented to reduce the PCE programming on the MP PCC.

   Optional shared replication segments can be used in networks that do
   not have unicast SR turned on.  These shared replication segments can
   be programmed on the bypass nodes without a P2MP Policy.  The
   replication segments on primary path can use these shared replication
   segments as a protection tunnel to protect links.

3.3.6.  Connecting Replication Segment via Segment List

   There could be nodes between two replication segment that do not
   support P2MP Policy or Replication segment.  It is possible to
   connect two non-adjacent Replication segments via a unicast segment
   routing path via a SID list, comprised of any IGP supported segment
   types (ex: Binding, Adjacency, Node) to forward to the next
   replicating node.  This information is encoded via the SR-ERO sub-
   objects and ERO-attributes objects.  The last segment in an encoding
   SID list MUST be a replication segment

3.4.  SR P2MP Policy and Replication Segment TLVs and Objects

3.4.1.  SR P2MP Policy Objects

   SR P2MP Policy can be constructed via the following objects

   <Common Header>

   <SRP>

   <P2MP LSP>

   optionally if the root is updating the PCE with end point list the
   end-point-list object can be added.

                         [<intended-path>])




   Path-attribute as per [draft-ietf-pce-multipath]

3.4.3.  P2MP Policy and Replication Segment general considerations

   The above new objects and TLV's defined in this document can be
   included in PCRpt, PcInitiate and PcUpd messages.

   It should be noted that every PcRpt, PcInitiate and PCUpd messages
   will contain full list of the Leaves and segment and forwarding
   information that is needed to build the Candidate path and its
   Replication segments.  They will never send the delta information
   related to the new leaves or forwarding information that need to be
   added or updated.  This is necessary to ensure that PCE or any new
   PCE is in sync with the PCC.

   When a PCRpt, PCInitiate and PCUpd messages is sent via PCEP it
   maintains the previous ERO Path IDs and generates new Path IDs for
   new instructions, as per [draft-ietf-pce-multipath].  The PATH IDs
   are maintained for each specific forwarding instructions until the
   instructions are deleted.  For example: When the first leaf is added,
   the PCE will update with PathI ID 1 to the PCC.  When the second leaf
   is added, according to the path calculated, PCE might just append the
   existing instruction Path ID 1 with a new Path ID 2 to construct the
   new PCUpd message.

   The CCI Object is used to identify the entire cross connect of
   incoming segment and the set of outgoing Interfaces and their
   corresponding SIDs/SIDList.  Any modification to the cross connect
   should use this CCI ID to identify the cross connect uniquely.
   Leaves and their corresponding Path IDs can be removed from the cross
   connect identified via the CCI.  The CC-ID is assigned by the PCE.

   All the nodes need to establish a PCEP connection with the PCE.

   During PCEP Initialization Phase, PCEP Speakers need to set flags N,
   M, P in the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV as defined in
   [draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp] section-5.2

   This draft extends the PCEP OPEN object by defining an optional TLV
   to indicate the PCE's capability to perform SR-P2MP path computations
   with a new IANA capability type.

   The inclusion of this TLV in an OPEN object indicates that the sender
   can perform SR-P2MP path computations.  This will be similar to the
   P2MP-CAPABILITY defined in [RFC8306] section-3.1.2 and a new value
   needs to be defined for SR-P2MP.

4.1.1.  PCECC Path Setup Capability

   A PST of PCECC is also added as per
   [draft-ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].

   This document also introduces a new bit S in the SR PCECC capacity
   Sub TLV indicating the support to handle PCECC based label download
   for Replication segment.

4.1.2.  Association Type Capability

   A Assoc-Type-List TLV as per [RFC8697] section 3.4 should be send via
   PCEP open object with following association type

   be set for this association type and must be ignored.

   The open message MUST include the MULTIPATH CAPABILITY TLV as defined
   in [draft-ietf-pce-multipath]

4.2.  Symbolic Name in PCInit Message from PCC

   As per [RFC8231] section 7.3.2. a Symbolic Path Name TLV should
   uniquely identify the P2MP path on the PCC.  This symbolic path name
   is a human-readable string that identifies an P2MP LSP in the
   network.  It needs to be constant through the lifetime of the P2MP
   path.

   As an example in the case of P2MP LSP the symbolic name can be p2mp
   policy name + candidate path name of the LSP.

4.3.  P2MP Policy Specific Objects and TLVs

4.3.1.  P2MP Policy Association Group for P2MP Policy

   Two ASSOCIATION object types for IPv4 and IPv6 are defined in
   [RFC8697].  The ASSOCIATION object includes "Association type"
   indicating the type of the association group.  This document adds a
   new Association type.  Association type = TBD1 "P2MP SR Policy
   Association Type" for SR Policy Association Group (P2MP SRPAG).  As
   per [draft-barth-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp] section 5, three new
   TLVs are identified to carry association information: P2MP-SRPAG-
   POL-ID-TLV, P2MP-SRPAG-CPATH-ID-TLV, P2MP-SRPAG-CPATH-ATTR-TLV

4.3.1.1.  P2MP SR Policy Association Group Policy Identifiers TLV

   The P2MP-SRPOLICY-POL-ID TLV is a mandatory TLV for the P2MP-SRPAG
   Association.  Only one P2MP-SRPOLICY-POL-ID TLV can be carried and
   only the first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be
   ignored.

   5.  the entire pce leaf list is overwritten and replaced with the new
       leaf list (leaf type = 5)

   A given P2MP END-POINTS object gathers the leaves of a given type.
   Note that a P2MP report can mix the different types of leaves by
   including several P2MP END-POINTS objects.  The END-POINTS object
   body has a variable length.  These are multiples of 4 bytes for IPv4,
   multiples of 16 bytes, plus 4 bytes, for IPv6.

4.4.  P2MP Policy and Replication Segment Identifier Object and TLV

   As it was mentioned previously both P2MP Policy and Replication
   Segment are identified via the LSP object and more precisely via the
   SR-P2MP-LSPID-TLV

   The P2MP Policy uses the PLSP-ID to identify the Candidate Paths and
   the Instance-ID to identify a Path-Instance with in the Candidate
   path.

   On other hand the Replication Segment uses the SR-P2MP-LSPID-TLV to
   identify and correlate a Replication Segment to a P2MP Policy

   As it was noted previously on the Root, the P2MP Policy and the
   Replication Segment is downloaded via the same PCUpd message.

4.4.1.  Extension of the LSP Object, SR-P2MP-LSPID-TLV

   The LSP Object is defined in Section 7.3 of [RFC8231].  It specifies
   the PLSP-ID to uniquely identify an LSP that is constant for the life
   time of a PCEP session.  Similarly, for a P2MP tunnel, the PLSP-ID
   identify a Candidate Path uniquely with in the P2MP policy.

   The LSP Object MUST include the new SR-P2MP-POLICY-ID-TLV (IPV4/IpV6)
   defined in this document below.  This is a variation to the P2MP
   object defined in [draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp]

4.5.  Replication Segment

   As per [draft-ietf-spring-sr-replication-segment] a replication
   segment has a next-hop-group which MAY contain a single outgoing
   replication SID or a list of SIDs (sr-policy-sid-list) In either case
   there needs to be a replication SID at the bottom of the stack.  This

   means two replication segments can be directly connected or connected
   via a SR domain.

4.5.1.  The format of the replication segment message

   The format of a Replication Segment message encoding is similar to
   P2MP Policy.  However, the P2MP Policy contains the association
   object and the replication segment message does not contain the
   association object.  In addition the replication segment uses the CCI
   object to identify a P2MP cross connect.  The replication segment is
   downloaded individually to the root, transit and leaf nodes without
   the P2MP Policy.  The P2MP Policy is a Root Concept.  The replication
   segment uses SR-P2MP-LSPID-TLV as its identifier.  The TLV is coded
   differently for shared and non-shared case.

   o  In the case of a replication segment being shared, the Tree-ID in
      the SR-P2MP-POLICY Identifier TLV is the replication-id of the
      Replication Segment and Root = 0, Instance-Id = 0.  When
      downloading a shared replication segment from PCE through a
      PcInitiate message, the SR-P2MP-POLICY Identifier TLV is all 0,
      and on the report back from PCC, PCC generates PLSP-ID,
      Replication-id (Tree-id field will be populated with replication-
      id).  Instance-id will be 0.

4.5.2.  PCECC

   The CCI Object as defined in
   [draft-ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] is used to
   identify a forwarding instruction in the Replication Segment.  A
   forwarding instruction is incoming SID and a set of outgoing
   branches.  The CCI Object-Type of 1 is used for the MPLS Label.  The
   label in the CCI Object is the incoming SID.  The outgoing SIDs are
   defined by the ERO Objects.

   The CCI Object can be include in Reports, initiate and Update
   messages for Replication Segments.

   The PCInitiate message defined in [RFC8281] and extended in
   [draft-ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] is further
   extended to support SR-P2MP replication segment based central control
   instructions.

4.5.4.  SR-ERO Rules

   Forwarding information of a replication segment can be configured and
   steered via many different mechanisms.

   As an example a replication SID can be steered via:

   1.  Replication SID steered with an IPv4/IPv6 directly connected
       nexthop

       *  In this case there will two SR-ERO in the ERO Object, with the
          Replication SID SR-ERO at the bottom and the IPv4/IPv6 SR-ERO
          on the top.

   2.  Replication SID steered with an IPv4/IPv6 loopback address that
       reside on the directly connected router.

       *  In this case there will two SR-ERO in the ERO Object, with the
          Replication SID SR-ERO at the bottom and the IPv4/IPv6 SR-ERO
          on the top.

       *  In addition a new flag D is added to the SR-ERO to signal that
          the Loopback nexthop is connected to the directly attached
          router.

   3.  Replication SID steered with unnumbered IPv4/IPv6 directly
       connected Interface

   4.  Replication SID steered via a SR adjacency or node SID

       *  In this case even a sid-list can be used to traffic engineer
          the path between two Replication Segment

       *  The Replication SID SR-ERO is at the bottom while the segments
          describing the path are on top in order.

4.5.4.1.  SR-ERO subobject changes

   SR-ERO from RFC 8664 is used to construct the forwarding information
   needed for Replication Segment.

   A new D flag was added to indicate a loopback nexthop that is
   residing on the directly attached router.  It should be noted that
   this flag should be set only for the loopback case and not for a
   local interface as a nexthop.

   Flags : F, S, C, M are already defined in rfc8664.

   This document defines a new flag D: If the next-hop in NAI field is
   system IP or loopback, this bit indicates whether the system IP /
   loopback is directly connected router or not.  If set indicates
   directly connected address.  When this bit is set, F bit should be 0
   (meaning NAI should be present)

5.  Tree Deletion

   To delete the entire tree (P2MP LSP), Root send a PCRpt message with
   the R bit of the LSP object set and all the fields of the SR-P2MP-
   LSP-ID TLV set to 0(indicating to remove all state associated with
   this P2MP tunnel).  The PCE in response sends a PCInitiate message
   with R bit in the SRP object SET to all nodes along the path to
   indicate deletion of the entries.

6.  Fragmentation

   The Fragmentation bit in the LSP object (F bit) can be used to
   indicate a fragmented PCEP message

   Note that on transit / leaf Initiate is with PLSP-ID = 0.  Therefore
   PLSP-ID is locally unique to a node.  It should be noted that the CC-
   ID does not need to be constant across all nodes that make up the
   path.

8.  IANA Consideration

   1.  This draft extends the PCEP OPEN object by defining an optional
       TLV to indicate the PCE's capability to perform SR-P2MP path
       computations with a new IANA capability type (TBD).

   2.  PCEP open object with a new association type " P2MP SR Policy
       Association " value (TBD).

   3.  A new Association type.  Association type = TBD1 "P2MP SR Policy
       Association Type" for SR Policy Association Group (P2MP SRPAG)

       1.  three new TLVs are identified to carry association
           information: P2MP-SRPAG- POL-ID-TLV, P2MP-SRPAG-CPATH-ID-TLV,
           P2MP-SRPAG-CPATH-ATTR-TLV

   4.  Two new TLVs for Identifying the P2MP Policy and the Replication
       segment SR-IPV4-P2MP-POLICY-ID TLV and SR-IPV6-P2MP-POLICY-ID TLV

   5.  A new SR-P2MP-NODE-ROLE TLV (Type To be assigned by IANA) that
       will be present in the PATH-ATTRIB object

9.  Security Considerations

   TBD
