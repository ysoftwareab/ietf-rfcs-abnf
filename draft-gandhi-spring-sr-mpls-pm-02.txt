                      Performance Measurement in 
              Segment Routing Networks with MPLS Data Plane
                   draft-gandhi-spring-sr-mpls-pm-02 

Abstract

   RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and
   accurate measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as
   well as related metrics such as delay variation in MPLS networks
   using probe messages.  This document reviews how these mechanisms can
   be used for Delay and Loss Performance Measurements (PM) in Segment
   Routing (SR) networks with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), for both SR
   links and end-to-end SR Policies.  The performance measurements for
   SR links are used to compute extended Traffic Engineering (TE)
   metrics for delay and loss and are advertised in the network using
   routing protocols.

Internet-Draft      SR-MPLS Performance Measurement        July 15, 2018


1.  Introduction

   Service provider's ability to satisfy Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
   depend on the ability to measure and monitor performance metrics for
   packet loss and one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics
   such as delay variation.  The ability to monitor these performance
   metrics also provides operators with greater visibility into the
   performance characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating
   planning, troubleshooting, and network performance evaluation.

   [RFC6374] specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and
   accurate measurement of these performance metrics in MPLS networks
   using probe messages.  The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol
   (OWAMP) defined in [RFC4656] and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol
   (TWAMP) defined in [RFC5357] provide capabilities for the measurement
   of various performance metrics in IP networks.  However, mechanisms
   defined in [RFC6374] are more suitable for Segment Routing (SR) when
   using MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS).  In addition, [RFC6374] also
   supports IEEE 1588 timestamps [IEEE1588] and "direct mode" Loss
   Measurement (LM), which are required in SR networks.

   [RFC7876] specifies the procedures to be used when sending and
   processing out-of-band performance measurement probe replies over an
   UDP return path when receiving RFC 6374 based probe queries.  These
   procedures can be used to send out-of-band PM replies for both SR
   links and SR Policies for one-way measurement.

   This document reviews how probe based mechanisms defined in [RFC6374]
   can be used for Delay and Loss Performance Measurements (PM) in SR
   networks with MPLS data plane, for both SR links and end-to-end SR
   Policies.  The performance measurements for SR links are used to
   compute extended Traffic Engineering (TE) metrics for delay and loss
   and are advertised in the network using routing protocols.

2.2.  Reference Topology

   In the reference topology shown in Figure 1, the querier node R1
   initiates a performance measurement probe query and the responder
   node R5 sends a probe response for the query message received.  The
   probe response is sent to the querier node R1.  The nodes R1 and R5
   may be directly connected via a link enabled with Segment Routing or
   there exists an SR Policy [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy] on node
   R1 with destination to node R5.

   Both delay and loss performance measurement is performed for the
   traffic traversing between node R1 and node R5.  One-way delay and
   two-way delay measurements are defined in Section 2.4 of [RFC6374]. 
   Transmit and Receive packet loss measurements are defined in Section
   2.2 of [RFC6374].  One-way loss measurement provides transmit packet
   loss whereas two-way loss measurement provides both transmit and
   receive packet loss.

3.  Probe Query and Response Packets

3.1.  Probe Packet Header for SR-MPLS Policies

   As described in Section 2.9.1 of [RFC6374], MPLS PM probe query and
   response messages flow over the MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-
   ACh).  A probe packet for an end-to-end measurement for SR Policy
   contains SR-MPLS label stack [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy],
   with the G-ACh Label (GAL) at the bottom of the stack.  The GAL is
   followed by an Associated Channel Header (ACH), which identifies the
   message type and the message payload following the ACH as shown in
   Figure 2.

3.2.  Probe Packet Header for SR-MPLS Links

   As described in Section 2.9.1 of [RFC6374], MPLS PM probe query and
   response messages flow over the MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-
   ACh).  A probe packet for SR-MPLS links contains G-ACh Label (GAL). 
   The GAL is followed by an Associated Channel Header (ACH), which
   identifies the message type, and the message payload following the
   ACH as shown in Figure 3.

3.3.  Probe Response Message for SR-MPLS Links and Policies

3.3.1.  One-way Measurement Probe Response Message

   For one-way performance measurement [RFC7679], the PM querier node
   can receive "out-of-band" probe replies by properly setting the UDP
   Return Object (URO) TLV in the probe query message.  The URO TLV
   (Type=131) is defined in [RFC7876] and includes the
   UDP-Destination-Port and IP Address.  In particular, if the querier
   sets its own IP address in the URO TLV, the probe response is sent
   back by the responder node to the querier node.  In addition, the
   "control code" in the probe query message is set to "out-of-band
   response requested".

3.3.2.  Two-way Measurement Probe Response Message

   For two-way performance measurement [RFC6374], when using a
   bidirectional channel, the probe response message is sent back to the
   querier node in-band on the reverse direction SR Link or SR Policy
   using a message with format similar to their probe query message.  In
   this case, the "control code" in the probe query message is set to
   "in-band response requested".


4.  Performance Delay Measurement

4.1.  Delay Measurement Message Format

   As defined in [RFC6374], MPLS DM probe query and response messages
   use Associated Channel Header (ACH) (value 0x000C for delay
   measurement) [RFC6374], which identifies the message type, and the
   message payload following the ACH.  For both SR links and end-to-end
   measurement for SR Policies, the same MPLS DM ACH value is used.

   The DM message payload as defined in [RFC6374] is used for SR-MPLS
   delay measurement, for both SR links and end-to-end SR Policies.  The
   DM message payload format is defined as following in [RFC6374]:

    0                   1                   2                   3

4.2.  Timestamp

   The Section 3.4 of [RFC6374] defines timestamp format that can be
   used for delay measurement.  The IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol
   (PTP) timestamp format [IEEE1588] is used by default as described in
   Appendix A of [RFC6374], but it may require hardware support.  As an
   alternative, Network Time Protocol (NTP) timestamp format can also be
   used [RFC6374].

   Note that for one-way delay measurement, clock synchronization
   between the querier and responder nodes using the methods detailed in
   [RFC6374] is required.  The two-way delay measurement does not
   require clock to be synchronized between the querier and responder
   nodes.

5.  Performance Loss Measurement

   The LM protocol can perform two distinct kinds of loss measurement as
   described in Section 2.9.8 of [RFC6374].  

   o  In inferred mode, LM will measure the loss of specially generated
      test messages in order to infer the approximate data plane loss
      level.  Inferred mode LM provides only approximate loss
      accounting.  

   o  In direct mode, LM will directly measure data plane packet loss. 
      Direct mode LM provides perfect loss accounting, but may require
      hardware support.

   For both of these modes of LM, path segment identifier
   [I-D.spring-mpls-path-segment] can be used for measuring traffic on
   the egress node.

5.1.  Loss Measurement Message Format

   As defined in [RFC6374], MPLS LM probe query and response messages
   use Associated Channel Header (ACH) (value 0x000A for direct loss
   measurement or value 0x000B for inferred loss measurement), which
   identifies the message type, and the message payload following the
   ACH.  For both SR links and end-to-end measurement for SR Policies,
   the same MPLS LM ACH value is used.

   The LM message payload as defined in [RFC6374] is used for SR-MPLS
   loss measurement, for both SR links and end-to-end SR Policies.  The
   LM message payload format is defined as following in [RFC6374]:

6.  SR Link Extended TE Metrics Advertisements

   The extended TE metrics for SR link delay and loss computed using the
   performance measurement procedures reviewed in this document can be
   advertised in the routing domain as follows:  

   o  For OSPF, ISIS, and BGP-LS, protocol extensions defined in
      [RFC7471], [RFC7810] [I-D.lsr-isis-rfc7810bis], and
      [I-D.idr-te-pm-bgp] are used, respectively for advertising the
      extended TE link metrics in the network.  

   o  The extended link delay metrics advertised are minimum-delay,
      maximum-delay, average-delay and delay-variance for one-way.  

   o  The delay-variance is computed as specified in Section 4.2 of
      [RFC5481].  

   o  The one-way delay metrics can be computed using two-way
      measurement by dividing the measured delay values by 2.  

   o  The extended TE link loss metric advertised is one-way percentage
      packet loss.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document reviews the procedures for performance measurement for
   SR-MPLS networks, for both SR-MPLS links and end-to-end SR-MPLS
   Policies using the mechanisms defined in [RFC6374].  This document
   does not introduce any additional security considerations other than
   those covered in [RFC6374], [RFC7471], [RFC7810].


8.  IANA Considerations
