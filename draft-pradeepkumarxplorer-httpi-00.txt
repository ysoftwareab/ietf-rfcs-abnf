1. Introduction

    To implement an httpi:// service in browser similar to https/http

2. Background
     Right now URL's are hardcoded. I propose an httpi:// service
     that would allow dynamic links that can be updated by the httpi
     service in the text that you are viewing. So every time interval like
     a minute or so, the content you are viewing using the httpi:// service
     in your browser can show links suggested by the WWW Brain
     that you can traverse or navigate

3. General Information of the service
        

      Having a parallel browser realm, that allows intelligent updates of
      navigatable links from WWW intelligent computing realm. Instead of using
      http:// you just need to type httpi:// in your URL and the texts you view
      would have in addition to hardcoded navigatable links also those suggested by
      the WWW brain. The URL's hardcoded in HTML would have the blue color and those
      suggested by the WWW Brain would have a different color.

      If i launch and type httpi://www.site.info , it would be showing navigatable
      links that are not created manually in addition to that are created
      manually. The WWW brain would suggest additional navigatable links. 

    
        If i publish a site with no hardcoded URL URI's and if i view the site 
     it would still show navigatable links.The navigatible links would chnage 
     depending on whats available in the WWW.
