1.  Introduction

   Remote attestation describes the attempt to determine and appraise
   properties, such as integrity and trustworthiness, of an endpoint --
   the attestee -- over a network to another endpoint -- the verifier --
   without direct access.  Typically, this kind of assessment is based
   on measurements of software components running on the attestee, where
   the hash values of all started software components are stored
   (extended into) a Trust-Anchor implemented as a Hardware Security
   Module (e.g. a Trusted Platform Module or similar) and reported via a
   signature over the measurements.

1.1.  Remote Attestation

   In essence, remote attestation is composed of three activities.  The
   following definitions are derived from the definitions presented in
   [PRIRA] and [TCGGLOSS].

   Attestation:  The creation of a claim about the properties of an
      attestee, such that the claim can be used as evidence.

   Conveyance:  The transfer of evidence from the attestee to the
      verifier.

   Verification:  The appraisal of evidence by evaluating it against
      declarative guidance.

   Protocols that facilitate Trust-Anchor based signatures in order to
   provide remote attestation are usually bi-directional challenge/
   response protocols, such as the Platform Trust Service protocol [PTS]
   or CAVES [PRIRA], where one entity sends a challenge that is included
   inside the response to ensure the recentness -- the freshness -- of
   the attestation information.  The corresponding interaction model
   tightly couples the three activities of creating, transferring and
   appraising evidence.

   The Time-Based Uni-directional Attestation family of protocols --
   TUDA -- described in this document can decouple the three activities
   remote attestation is composed of.  As a result, TUDA provides
   additional capabilities, such as:



Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2017


   o  remote attestation for attestees that might not always be able to
      reach the Internet by enabling the verification of past states,

   o  secure audit logs by combining the evidence created via TUDA with
      measurement logs that represent a detailed record of corresponding
      past states,

   o  an uni-directional interaction model that can traverse "diode-
      like" network security functions or can be leveraged in RESTful
      architectures (e.g.  CoAP [RFC7252]), analogously.

1.2.  Attestation and Verification

   TUDA is a family of protocols that package results from specific
   attestation and verification protocols.  TUDA is currently
   instantiated for attestion activity based on a Trusted Platform
   Module (TPM [TPM12]), a specific Hardware Security Module (HSM)
   providing, e.g., Platform Configuration Registers (PCR), restricted
   signing keys, and a source of (relative) time (i.e. a tick-counter).

   Both the attestation and the verification activity of TUDA also
   require a trusted Time Stamp Authority (TSA) as an additional third
   party next to the attestee and the verifier.  The current protocol
   instantiaton uses a Time Stamp Authority based on [RFC3161].  The
   combination of the local source of time provided by the TPM (located
   on the attestee) and the Time Stamp Tokens provided by the TSA (to
   both the attestee and the verifier) enable the attestation and
   verification of an appropriate freshness of the evidence conveyed by
   the attestee -- without requiring a challenge/response interaction
   model that uses a nonce to ensure the freshness.

   The verification activity also requires declarative guidance
   (representing desired or compliant endpoint configuration and state)
   evidence conveyed by the attestee can be evaluated against.  The
   acquisition or representation of declarative guidance as well as the
   corresponding evaluation methods are out of the scope of this
   document.

1.3.  Information Elements and Conveyance

   TUDA defines a set of information elements (IE) that are created or
   stored on the attestee and are intended to be transferred to the
   verifier in order to enable appraisal.

   Each TUDA IE is encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation
   (CBOR [RFC7049]) to minimize the volume of data in motion.  In this
   document, the composition of the CBOR data items that represent IE is




Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2017


   described using the CBOR Data Definition Language, CDDL
   [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl].

   Each TUDA IE that requires a certain freshness is only created/
   updated when out-dated, which reduces the overall resources required
   from the attestee, including the utilization of the TPM.  The IE that
   have to be created are determined by their age or by specific state
   changes on the attestee (e.g. state changes due to a reboot-cycle).

   Each TUDA IE is only transferred when required, which reduces the
   amount of data in motion necessary to conduct remote attestation
   significantly.  Only IE that have changed since their last conveyance
   have to be transferred.

   Each TUDA IE that requires a certain freshness can be reused for
   multiple remote attestation procedures in the limits of its
   corresponding freshness-window, further reducing the load imposed on
   the attestee and its corresponding TPM.

1.4.  TUDA Objectives

   The Time-Based Uni-directional Attestation family of protocols is
   designed to:

   o  increase the confidence in authentication and authorization
      procedures,

   o  address the requirements of constrained-node networks,

   o  support interaction models that do not maintain connection-state
      over time, such as REST architectures [REST],

   o  be able to leverage existing management interfaces, such as SNMP
      [RFC3411].  RESTCONF [RFC8040] or CoMI [I-D.ietf-core-comi] -- and
      corresponding bindings,

   o  support broadcast and multicast schemes (e.g.  [IEEE1609]),

   o  be able to cope with temporary loss of connectivity, and to

   o  provide trustworthy audit logs of past endpoint states.

1.5.  Hardware Dependencies

   The binding of the attestation scheme used by TUDA to generate the
   TUDA IE is specific to the methods provided by the HSM used.  As a
   reference, this document includes pseudo-code that illustrates the
   production of TUDA IE using a TPM 1.2 and the corresponding TPM



Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2017


   commands specified in [TPM12] as an example.  The references to TPM
   1.2 commands and corresponding pseudo-code only serve as guidance to
   enable a better understanding of the attestation scheme and is
   intended to encourages the use of any appropriate HSM or equivalent
   set of Trust-Zone functions.

1.6.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119, BCP 14 [RFC2119].

2.  TUDA Core Concept

   There are significant differences between conventional bi-directional
   attestation and TUDA regarding both the information elements conveyed
   between attestee and verifier and the time-frame, in which an
   attestation can be considered to be fresh (and therefore
   trustworthy).

   In general, remote attestation using a bi-directional communication
   scheme includes sending a nonce-challenge within a signed attestation
   token.  Using the TPM 1.2 as an example, a corresponding nonce-
   challenge would be included within the signature created by the
   TPM_Quote command in order to prove the freshness of the attestation
   response, see e.g.  [PTS].

   In contrast, the TUDA protocol would use a combination output of
   TPM_CertifyInfo and TPM_TickStampBlob.  The former provides a proof
   about the platform's state by attesting that a certain key is bound
   to said state.  The latter provides proof that the platform was in
   the specified state by using the bound key in a time operation.  This
   combination enables a time-based attestation scheme.  This approach
   is based on the concepts introduced in [SCALE] and [SFKE2008].

   The payload of information elements transmitted is based on different
   methods, because the time-frame, in which an attestation is
   considered to be fresh (and therefore trustworthy), is defined
   differently.

   The freshness properties of a challenge-response based protocol
   define the point-of-time of attestation between:

   o  the time of transmission of the nonce, and

   o  the reception of the response




Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2017


   Given the time-based attestation scheme, the freshness property of
   TUDA is equivalent to that of bi-directional challenge response
   attestation, if the point-in-time of attestation lies between:

   o  the transmission of a TUDA time-synchronization token, and

   o  the typical round-trip time between the verifier and the attestee,

   The accuracy of this time-frame is defined by two factors:

   o  the time-synchronization between the attestee and the TSA.  The
      time between the two TPM tickstamps give the maximum drift (left
      and right) to the TSA timestamp, and

   o  the drift of local TPM clocks.

   Since TUDA attestations do not rely upon a verifier provided value
   (i.e. the nonce), the security guarantees of the protocol only
   incorporate the TSA and the TPM.  As a consequence TUDA attestations
   can even serve as proof of integrity in audit logs with point in time
   guarantees, in contrast to classical attestations.

   Appendix A contains guidance on how to utilize a REST architecture.

   Appendix B contains guidance on how to create an SNMP binding and a
   corresponding TUDA-MIB.

   Appendix C contains a corrresponding YANG module that supports both
   RESTCONF and CoMI.

   Appendix D contains a realization of TUDA using TPM 1.2 primitives.
   A realization of TUDA using TPM 2.0 primitives will be added with the
   next iteration of this document.

2.1.  Terminology

   This document introduces roles, information elements and types
   required to conduct TUDA and uses terminology (e.g. specific
   certificate names) typically seen in the context of attestation or
   hardware security modules.

2.1.1.  Universal Terms

   Attestation Identity Key (AIK):  a special purpose signature
      (therefore asymmetric) key that supports identity related
      operations.  The private portion of the key pair is maintained
      confidential to the entity via appropriate measures (that have an
      impact on the scope of confidence).  The public portion of the key



Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2017


      pair may be included in AIK credentials that provide a claim about
      the entity.

   Claim:  an attribute value pair that is intended to be related to a
      statement [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology].

   Endpoint Attestation:  the creation of evidence on the attestee that
      provides proof of a set of the endpoints's integrity measurements.
      This is done by digitally signing a set of PCRs using an AIK in
      the TPM.

   Endpoint Characteristics:  the composition, configuration and state
      of an endpoint.

   Evidence:  a trustworthy set of claims about an endpoint's
      characteristics.

   Identity:  a set of claims that is intended to be related to an
      entity.

   Integrity Measurements:  Metrics of endpoint characteristics (i.e.
      composition, configuration and state) that affect the confidence
      in the trustworthiness of an endpoint.  Digests of integrity
      measurements can be stored in shielded locations (i.e.  PCR of a
      TPM).

   Reference Integrity Measurements:  Signed measurements about the
      characteristics of an endpoint's characteristics that are provided
      by a vendor and are intended to be used as declarative guidance
      [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology] (e.g. a signed CoSWID).

   Trustworthy:  the qualities of an endpoint that guarantee a specific
      behavior and/or endpoint characteristics defined by declarative
      guidance.  Analogously, trustworthiness is the quality of being
      trustworthy with respect to declarative guidance.  Trustworthiness
      is not an absolute property but defined with respect to an entity,
      corresponding declarative guidance, and has a scope of confidence.

      Trustworthy Endpoint: an endpoint that guarantees trustworthy
      behavior and/or composition (with respect to certain declarative
      guidance and a scope of confidence).

      Trustworthy Statement: evidence that is trustworthy conveyed by an
      endpoint that is not necessarily trustworthy.

2.1.2.  Roles

   Attestee:  the endpoint that is the subject of the attestation to
      another endpoint.

   Verifier:  the endpoint that consumes the attestation of another
      endpoint to conduct a verification.

   TSA:  a Time Stamp Authority [RFC3161]

2.1.3.  General Types

   Byte:  the now customary synonym for octet

   Cert:  an X.509 certificate represented as a byte-string

2.1.4.  TPM-Specific Terms

   PCR:  a Platform Configuration Register that is part of a TPM and is
      used to securely store and report measurements about security
      posture

   PCR-Hash:  a hash value of the security posture measurements stored
      in a TPM PCR (e.g. regarding running software instances)
      represented as a byte-string

2.1.5.  Certificates

   TSA-CA:  the Certificate Authority that provides the certificate for
      the TSA represented as a Cert

   AIK-CA:  the Certificate Authority that provides the certificate for
      the attestation identity key of the TPM.  This is the client
      platform credential for this protocol.  It is a placeholder for a
      specific CA and AIK-Cert is a placeholder for the corresponding
      certificate, depending on what protocol was used.  The specific
      protocols are out of scope for this document, see also
      [AIK-Enrollment] and [IEEE802.1AR].

3.  Time-Based Uni-Directional Attestation

   A Time-Based Uni-Directional Attestation (TUDA) consists of the
   following seven information elements.  They are used to gain
   assurance of the Attestee's platform configuration at a certain point
   in time:






Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2017


   TSA Certificate:  The certificate of the Time Stamp Authority that is
      used in a subsequent synchronization protocol token.  This
      certificate is signed by the TSA-CA.

   AIK Certificate:  A certificate about the Attestation Identity Key
      (AIK) used.  This may or may not also be an [IEEE802.1AR] IDevID
      or LDevID, depending on their setting of the corresponding
      identity property.  ([AIK-Credential], [AIK-Enrollment]; see
      Appendix D.2.1.)

   Synchronization Token:  The reference for Attestations are the Tick-
      Sessions of the TPM.  In order to put Attestations into relation
      with a Real Time Clock (RTC), it is necessary to provide a
      cryptographic synchronization between the tick session and the
      RTC.  To do so, a synchronization protocol is run with a Time
      Stamp Authority (TSA).

   Restriction Info:  The attestation relies on the capability of the
      TPM to operate on restricted keys.  Whenever the PCR values for
      the machine to be attested change, a new restricted key is created
      that can only be operated as long as the PCRs remain in their
      current state.

      In order to prove to the Verifier that this restricted temporary
      key actually has these properties and also to provide the PCR
      value that it is restricted, the TPM command TPM_CertifyInfo is
      used.  It creates a signed certificate using the AIK about the
      newly created restricted key.

   Measurement Log:  Similarly to regular attestations, the Verifier
      needs a way to reconstruct the PCRs' values in order to estimate
      the trustworthiness of the device.  As such, a list of those
      elements that were extended into the PCRs is reported.  Note
      though that for certain environments, this step may be optional if
      a list of valid PCR configurations exists and no measurement log
      is required.

   Implicit Attestation:  The actual attestation is then based upon a
      TPM_TickStampBlob operation using the restricted temporary key
      that was certified in the steps above.  The TPM_TickStampBlob is
      executed and thereby provides evidence that at this point in time
      (with respect to the TPM internal tick-session) a certain
      configuration existed (namely the PCR values associated with the
      restricted key).  Together with the synchronization token this
      tick-related timing can then be related to the real-time clock.

   Concise SWID tags:  As an option to better assess the trustworthiness
      of an Attestee, a Verifier can request the reference hashes (often

      referred to as golden measurements) of all started software
      components to compare them with the entries in the measurement
      log.  References hashes regarding installed (and therefore
      running) software can be provided by the manufacturer via SWID
      tags.  SWID tags are provided by the Attestee using the Concise
      SWID representation [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid] and bundled into a CBOR
      array.  Ideally, the reference hashes include a signature created
      by the manufacturer of the software.

   These information elements could be sent en bloc, but it is
   recommended to retrieve them separately to save bandwidth, since
   these elements have different update cycles.  In most cases,
   retransmitting all seven information elements would result in
   unnecessary redundancy.

   Furthermore, in some scenarios it might be feasible not to store all
   elements on the Attestee endpoint, but instead they could be
   retrieved from another location or pre-deployed to the Verifier.  It
   is also feasible to only store public keys at the Verifier and skip
   the whole certificate provisioning completely in order to save
   bandwidth and computation time for certificate verification.

3.1.  TUDA Information Elements Update Cycles

   An endpoint can be in various states and have various information
   associated with it during its life cycle.  For TUDA, a subset of the
   states (which can include associated information) that an endpoint
   and its TPM can be in, is important to the attestation process.

   o  Some states are persistent, even after reboot.  This includes
      certificates that are associated with the endpoint itself or with
      services it relies on.

   o  Some states are more volatile and change at the beginning of each
      boot cycle.  This includes the TPM-internal Tick-Session which
      provides the basis for the synchronization token and implicit
      attestation.

   o  Some states are even more volatile and change during an uptime
      cycle (the period of time an endpoint is powered on, starting with
      its boot).  This includes the content of PCRs of a TPM and thereby
      also the PCR-restricted keys used during attestation.

   Depending on this "lifetime of state", data has to be transported
   over the wire, or not.  E.g. information that does not change due to
   a reboot typically has to be transported only once between the
   Attestee and the Verifier.

   There are three kinds of events that require a renewed attestation:

   o  The Attestee completes a boot-cycle

   o  A relevant PCR changes

   o  Too much time has passed since the last attestation statement

   The third event listed above is variable per application use case and
   can therefore be set appropriately.  For usage scenarios, in which
   the device would periodically push information to be used in an
   audit-log, a time-frame of approximately one update per minute should
   be sufficient in most cases.  For those usage scenarios, where
   verifiers request (pull) a fresh attestation statement, an
   implementation could use the TPM continuously to always present the
   most freshly created results.  To save some utilization of the TPM
   for other purposes, however, a time-frame of once per ten seconds is
   recommended, which would leave 80% of utilization for applications.

4.  Sync Base Protocol

   The uni-directional approach of TUDA requires evidence on how the TPM
   time represented in ticks (relative time since boot of the TPM)
   relates to the standard time provided by the TSA.  The Sync Base
   Protocol (SBP) creates evidence that binds the TPM tick time to the
   TSA timestamp.  The binding information is used by and conveyed via
   the Sync Token (TUDA IE).  There are three actions required to create
   the content of a Sync Token:

   o  At a given point in time (called left), a tickstamp counter value
      is acquired from the TPM that is also signed by the TPM.  The hash
      of counter and signature is used as a nonce in the request
      directed at the TSA.

   o  The corresponding response includes a data-structure incorporating
      the timestamp and its signature created by the TSA.

   o  At the point in time the response arrives (right), a signed
      tickstamp counter value is acquired from the TPM again, using a
      hash of the signed TSA timestamp as a nonce.

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2017


   The three time-related values -- TPM tick counters (left and right)
   and the TSA timestamp -- and their corresponding signatures are
   aggregated in order to create a corresponding Sync Token to be used
   as a TUDA Information Element that can be conveyed as evidence to a
   verifier.

   The drift of a TPM clock that drives the increments of the tick
   counter constitutes one of the triggers that can initiate a TUDA
   Information Element Update Cycle in respect to the freshness of the
   available Sync Token.  The following functions illustrate the worst
   case freshness-window assuming the maximum drift of TPM tick counters
   that is considered acceptable in respect to the standard time -- 15
   percent -- as defined by the TPM specification:

Appendix A.  REST Realization

   Each of the seven data items is defined as a media type (Section 5).
   Representations of resources for each of these media types can be
   retrieved from URIs that are defined by the respective servers
   [RFC7320].  As can be derived from the URI, the actual retrieval is
   via one of the HTTPs ([RFC7230], [RFC7540]) or CoAP [RFC7252].  How a
   client obtains these URIs is dependent on the application; e.g., CoRE

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2017


   Web links [RFC6690] can be used to obtain the relevant URIs from the
   self-description of a server, or they could be prescribed by a
   RESTCONF data model [RFC8040].

Appendix B.  SNMP Realization

   SNMPv3 [STD62] [RFC3411] is widely available on computers and also
   constrained devices.  To transport the TUDA information elements, an
   SNMP MIB is defined below which encodes each of the seven TUDA
   information elements into a table.  Each row in a table contains a
   single read-only columnar SNMP object of datatype OCTET-STRING.  The
   values of a set of rows in each table can be concatenated to
   reconstitute a CBOR-encoded TUDA information element.  The Verifier
   can retrieve the values for each CBOR fragment by using SNMP GetNext
   requests to "walk" each table and can decode each of the CBOR-encoded
   data items based on the corresponding CDDL
   [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl] definition.

   Design Principles:

   1.  Over time, TUDA attestation values age and should no longer be
       used.  Every table in the TUDA MIB has a primary index with the
       value of a separate scalar cycle counter object that
       disambiguates the transition from one attestation cycle to the
       next.

   2.  Over time, the measurement log information (for example) may grow
       large.  Therefore, read-only cycle counter scalar objects in all
       TUDA MIB object groups facilitate more efficient access with SNMP
       GetNext requests.

   3.  Notifications are supported by an SNMP trap definition with all
       of the cycle counters as bindings, to alert a Verifier that a new
       attestation cycle has occurred (e.g., synchronization data,
       measurement log, etc. have been updated by adding new rows and
       possibly deleting old rows).

B.1.  Structure of TUDA MIB

   The following table summarizes the object groups, tables and their
   indexes, and conformance requirements for the TUDA MIB:

   |-------------|-------|----------|----------|----------|

B.1.1.  Cycle Index

   A tudaV1<Group>CycleIndex is the:

   1.  first index of a row (element instance or element fragment) in
       the tudaV1<Group>Table;

   2.  identifier of an update cycle on the table, when rows were added
       and/or deleted from the table (bounded by tudaV1<Group>Cycles);
       and

   3.  binding in the tudaV1TrapV2Cycles notification for directed
       polling.

B.1.2.  Instance Index

   A tudaV1<Group>InstanceIndex is the:

   1.  second index of a row (element instance or element fragment) in
       the tudaV1<Group>Table; except for

   2.  a row in the tudaV1SyncTokenTable (that has only one instance per
       cycle).

B.1.3.  Fragment Index

   A tudaV1<Group>FragmentIndex is the:

   1.  last index of a row (always an element fragment) in the
       tudaV1<Group>Table; and

   2.  accomodation for SNMP transport mapping restrictions for large
       string elements that require fragmentation.

B.2.  Relationship to Host Resources MIB

   The General group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the System group in
   the Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] and provides context information for
   the TUDA attestation process.

   The Verify Token group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Device
   group in the Host MIB and represents the verifiable state of a TPM
   device and its associated system.

   The SWID Tag group (containing a Concise SWID reference hash profile
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid]) in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Software
   Installed and Software Running groups in the Host Resources MIB
   [RFC2790].

B.3.  Relationship to Entity MIB

   The General group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Entity General
   group in the Entity MIB v4 [RFC6933] and provides context information
   for the TUDA attestation process.

   The SWID Tag group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Entity Logical
   group in the Entity MIB v4 [RFC6933].

B.4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The General group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the System group in
   MIB-II [RFC1213] and the System group in the SNMPv2 MIB [RFC3418] and
   provides context information for the TUDA attestation process.

Appendix D.  Realization with TPM 1.2 functions

D.1.  TPM Functions

   The following TPM structures, resources and functions are used within
   this approach.  They are based upon the TPM 1.2 specification
   [TPM12].

D.1.1.  Tick-Session and Tick-Stamp

   On every boot, the TPM initializes a new Tick-Session.  Such a tick-
   session consists of a nonce that is randomly created upon each boot
   to identify the current boot-cycle - the phase between boot-time of
   the device and shutdown or power-off - and prevent replaying of old
   tick-session values.  The TPM uses its internal entropy source that
   guarantees virtually no collisions of the nonce values between two of
   such boot cycles.

   It further includes an internal timer that is being initialize to
   Zero on each reboot.  From this point on, the TPM increments this
   timer continuously based upon its internal secure clocking
   information until the device is powered down or set to sleep.  By its
   hardware design, the TPM will detect attacks on any of those
   properties.




Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 51]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2017


   The TPM offers the function TPM_TickStampBlob, which allows the TPM
   to create a signature over the current tick-session and two
   externally provided input values.  These input values are designed to
   serve as a nonce and as payload data to be included in a
   TickStampBlob: TickstampBlob := sig(TPM-key, currentTicks || nonce ||
   externalData).

   As a result, one is able to proof that at a certain point in time
   (relative to the tick-session) after the provisioning of a certain
   nonce, some certain externalData was known and provided to the TPM.
   If an approach however requires no input values or only one input
   value (such as the use in this document) the input values can be set
   to well-known value.  The convention used within TCG specifications
   and within this document is to use twenty bytes of zero
   h'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' as well-known value.

D.1.2.  Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs)

   The TPM is a secure cryptoprocessor that provides the ability to
   store measurements and metrics about an endpoint's configuration and
   state in a secure, tamper-proof environment.  Each of these security
   relevant metrics can be stored in a volatile Platform Configuration
   Register (PCR) inside the TPM.  These measurements can be conducted
   at any point in time, ranging from an initial BIOS boot-up sequence
   to measurements taken after hundreds of hours of uptime.

   The initial measurement is triggered by the Platforms so-called pre-
   BIOS or ROM-code.  It will conduct a measurement of the first
   loadable pieces of code; i.e.\ the BIOS.  The BIOS will in turn
   measure its Option ROMs and the BootLoader, which measures the OS-
   Kernel, which in turn measures its applications.  This describes a
   so-called measurement chain.  This typically gets recorded in a so-
   called measurement log, such that the values of the PCRs can be
   reconstructed from the individual measurements for validation.

   Via its PCRs, a TPM provides a Root of Trust that can, for example,
   support secure boot or remote attestation.  The attestation of an
   endpoint's identity or security posture is based on the content of an
   TPM's PCRs (platform integrity measurements).

D.1.3.  PCR restricted Keys

   Every key inside the TPM can be restricted in such a way that it can
   only be used if a certain set of PCRs are in a predetermined state.
   For key creation the desired state for PCRs are defined via the
   PCRInfo field inside the keyInfo parameter.  Whenever an operation
   using this key is performed, the TPM first checks whether the PCRs

   are in the correct state.  Otherwise the operation is denied by the
   TPM.

D.1.4.  CertifyInfo

   The TPM offers a command to certify the properties of a key by means
   of a signature using another key.  This includes especially the
   keyInfo which in turn includes the PCRInfo information used during
   key creation.  This way, a third party can be assured about the fact
   that a key is only usable if the PCRs are in a certain state.

D.2.  Protocol and Procedure

D.2.1.  AIK and AIK Certificate

   Attestations are based upon a cryptographic signature performed by
   the TPM using a so-called Attestation Identity Key (AIK).  An AIK has
   the properties that it cannot be exported from a TPM and is used for
   attestations.  Trust in the AIK is established by an X.509
   Certificate emitted by a Certificate Authority.  The AIK certificate
   is either provided directly or via a so-called PrivacyCA
   [AIK-Enrollment].

   This element consists of the AIK certificate that includes the AIK's
   public key used during verification as well as the certificate chain
   up to the Root CA for validation of the AIK certificate itself.

   TUDA-Cert = [AIK-Cert, TSA-Cert]; maybe split into two for SNMP
   AIK-Cert = Cert
   TSA-Cert = Cert

                    Figure 2: TUDA-Cert element in CDDL

   The TSA-Cert is a standard certificate of the TSA.

   The AIK-Cert may be provisioned in a secure environment using
   standard means or it may follow the PrivacyCA protocols.  Figure 3
   gives a rough sketch of this protocol.  See [AIK-Enrollment] for more
   information.

   The X.509 Certificate is built from the AIK public key and the
   corresponding PKCS #7 certificate chain, as shown in Figure 3.

D.2.2.  Synchronization Token

   The reference for Attestations are the Tick-Sessions of the TPM.  In
   order to put Attestations into relation with a Real Time Clock (RTC),
   it is necessary to provide a cryptographic synchronization between
   the tick session and the RTC.  To do so, a synchronization protocol
   is run with a Time Stamp Authority (TSA) that consists of three
   steps:

   o  The TPM creates a TickStampBlob using the AIK

   o  This TickstampBlob is used as nonce to the Timestamp of the TSA

   o  Another TickStampBlob with the AIK is created using the TSA's
      Timestamp a nonce

   The first TickStampBlob is called "left" and the second "right" in a
   reference to their position on a time-axis.

   These three elements, with the TSA's certificate factored out, form
   the synchronization token

D.2.3.  RestrictionInfo

   The attestation relies on the capability of the TPM to operate on
   restricted keys.  Whenever the PCR values for the machine to be
   attested change, a new restricted key is created that can only be
   operated as long as the PCRs remain in their current state.

   In order to prove to the Verifier that this restricted temporary key
   actually has these properties and also to provide the PCR value that
   it is restricted, the TPM command TPM_CertifyInfo is used.  It
   creates a signed certificate using the AIK about the newly created
   restricted key.

   This token is formed from the list of:

   o  PCR list,

   o  the newly created restricted public key, and

   o  the certificate.

D.2.4.  Measurement Log

   Similarly to regular attestations, the Verifier needs a way to
   reconstruct the PCRs' values in order to estimate the trustworthiness
   of the device.  As such, a list of those elements that were extended
   into the PCRs is reported.  Note though that for certain
   environments, this step may be optional if a list of valid PCR
   configurations exists and no measurement log is required.

D.2.5.  Implicit Attestation

   The actual attestation is then based upon a TickStampBlob using the
   restricted temporary key that was certified in the steps above.  The
   TPM-Tickstamp is executed and thereby provides evidence that at this
   point in time (with respect to the TPM internal tick-session) a
   certain configuration existed (namely the PCR values associated with
   the restricted key).  Together with the synchronization token this
   tick-related timing can then be related to the real-time clock.

   This element consists only of the TPM_TickStampBlock with no nonce.

   provided covers the entire verification task.  If only a subset of
   TUDA elements changed (see Section 3.1), only the corresponding code
   listings need to be re-executed.
