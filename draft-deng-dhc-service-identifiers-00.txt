Internet-Draft             Service Identifiers             November 2007


1.  Introduction

   With the various kind of promising wireless broadband access
   technologies, there are more possbilities that mobile node could have
   multiple connections which may provide different kind of service
   available.

   In some cases, the operator would like to let the mobile node to know
   what kind of services it allow or doesn't allow in this connection.
   It may influence network routing,policy and quality of service, et
   al. consideration.

   option-code: OPTION_SERVICE_IDENTIFIER (TBD).

   option-length: length of the "service identifier list" field in
   octets.

   list-type: The type of service identifer:

         0 Supported

         1 Not Supported

   Identifier

         A variable length UTF-8 encoded service identifier string used
         to identify the requested service. 'ims', 'voip' and 'p2p' are

3.  Option usage

   There are various kind of wireless broadband access technologies, one
   mobile node may has multiple wireless cards, subscriber may choose
   different connection for different service.  So a DHCPv6 server may
   provide a list of service identifiers option to different clients.
   The mobile node will decide which service may take which connection
   based on this advertisement of this dhcp option.

   This option could be advertised to dhcp client after authentication
   procedure to guarantee eligible subscriber could get this
   information.

5.  IANA Consideration

   This document defines new DHCPv6 options, and IANA is requested to
   assign the following new DHCPv6 Option Codes in the registry
   maintained in http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters: o
   OPTION_SERVICE_IDENTIFIER for the Service Identifier List option
