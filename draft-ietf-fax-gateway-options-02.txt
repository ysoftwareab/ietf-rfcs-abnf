1. Introduction

   An Internet FAX Gateway can be classified as an offramp gateway and an
   onramp gateway.
   This document provides information on guideline of optional services
   and some examples for Internet FAX Gateway.
   This document covers Drop Duplication, Automatic re-transmission,
   Error Behavior, When send return notice, Keep log, for an offramp gateway.
   Example of authorization by DTMF, Keep log, for an onramp gateway.

   A more detailed definition of onramps and offramps is provided in 
   [RFC2542].

   Information on recommended behaviors for Internet FAX Gateways Functions
   defined in [draft-ietf-fax-gateway-protocol-03].

Internet Draft       Guideline of optional services             May 2001
                        for Internet FAX Gateway


   Scope of Internet FAX Gateway defined in this document is shown
   below.

 1) A format of image data is a data format defined by "Simple Mode" 
    in [RFC2305].
 2) Operational mode is "store and forward" defined in section 2.5 of 
    [RFC2542]



2. Optional services for an offramp gateway


2.1 Drop Duplications

   By the case an offramp gateway detects duplicate mail.
   Such the case an offramp gateway is required to drop the duplicate mail.
   This is to avoid the duplication of the transmission to same facsimile 
   device over GSTN.

   For example, an MTA is set to put the mail of the different address in 
   the same mail box. Some kinds of MTA copy same mail in one mailbox, when 
   MTA receives broadcast mail (mail of more than one destination address).
   Then an offramp gateway receives mail using POP from the MTA.
   As a result, the offramp gateway receives duplicate mail from MTA.

   As for the duplicate message detection mechanism, it is entrusted to other
   documents.



2.2 Automatic re-transmission in the delivery error occurrence

   An offramp gateway MAY add function, that the offramp gateway
   automatically retry and permit to send facsimile data when delivery
   failure. If this function is enabled, retry times and retry interval MAY
   be specified optionally by administrator of offramp gateway.
   This case, return notice SHOULD be sent only when last facsimile
   transmission is error after specified retry times are finished.
   When the Transmission is suspended by the Error, the Transmission is 
   started to send at error page on Next transmission .

   For example, an offramp gateway is sending total 5 pages facsimile data.
   But an error occurs and transmission is stopped after 2 pages are sent
   normally. The offramp gateway should re-transmit the facsimile data from
   page 3.

                        for Internet FAX Gateway


2.3 Error Behavior

   Retransmission behavior depends on the kind the Errors.

   In Calling Errors, such as Busy, Line errors and so on.
   An offramp gateway do Retransmission.

   In Connecting Errors, such as Paper Error, Stop Event error,
   not FAX error (Voice Response).
   An offramp gateway send the Return notice to sender without any
   retransmission.

   That is why Calling Errors probably be recovered, but Connecting
   errors can hardly be recoverd.



2.4 When send return notice

   When an offramp gateway receives broadcast mail, there are two way to send
   return notice.
   An offramp gateway send return notice as soon as an error occurs.

   An offramp gateway send return notice at every finish of specified number 
   of transmissions.

   These features should be selectable by the user.


   EXAMPLE

   The source user requested to send to 20000 address, and had a lot of
   errors over 1000 address.

   If an offramp gateway send return notice as soon as an error occurs,
   the source user receive over 1000 return notice from an offramp 
   gateway. but, the source user can receive return notice as soon as
   error occurrence.

   If an offramp gateway send return notice every time transmission is 
   finished 10 times, the source user received return notice of 1/10
   of the number.

2.5 When a transmitting error occurred in return notice

   When an offramp gateway fails in transmission of return notice,
   The Internet Fax Gateway SHOULD process either of the following.

   When a log information preservation function is in a gateway, 
   An error information SHOULD be recorded to a log and processing SHOULD
   be ended. At this time, the administrator of a gateway system SHOULD
   be notified of these errors information with a certain means
   (for example, SMTP). 

   The case where there is no log information preservation function
   in a gateway ,
   An administrator SHOULD be told about failure and processing SHOULD
   be ended. 

   If the capability which the hardware of a gateway has is high and 
   there is a time margin, it is good service to perform the following 
   processing.   
   When it fails in transmission of the notice of a result,
   A fixed time interval is vacated.
   And notice output operation is repeated as a result of the number of 
   times of specification.    
   The number time of specification times -- even if it repeats, when failing,
   An error information is recorded to a log and processing is finished.
   Also at this time, as for these errors information, the administrator of
   the gateway system SHOULD be notified with a certain means
   (for example, SMTP).

                        for Internet FAX Gateway


2.6 keep log

   An offramp gateway MAY have the function which following information is 
   kept as log.
   For security and message trace,
   The Internet FAX gateway MAY use the format of a system log or an event
   log of the Operation System.

   - Date and time when transmit request received
   - Source address
   - Destination address
   - Date and time when transmit over GSTN
   - Date and time when transmission was finished over GSTN
   - Number of real transmitted page
   - Byte count of transmitted data
   - Kind of the data (resolution)
   - Existence of error occurrence
   - Numbers of automatically retry sending
   - Date and time of transmitting delivery notice

   The log information preservation function aims at mainly becoming
   a help of security or Charge calculation processing.

   When the hardware system equipped with some recording media 
   (HDD, FDD, etc.)is used, the log information SHOULD be saved as
   a log file. 

   The opportunity which saves log information can consider three of 
   the following.
   
   1) When an offramp gateway receives a distribution demand.
   2) When an offramp gateway starts distribution.
   3) When an offramp gateway ends distribution.

   When the hardware system without a certain recording medium is used, 
   log information cannot be saved locally. In this case, it is desirable 
   to hold the function saved at other PCs using the existing network 
   communication means, such as a function to save log information as 
   a file using a Network File System, and SMTP, SNMP, or the function 
   printed out periodically. 

   In order to strengthen security, it is desirable to save log information 
   in the Internet Fax Gateway using a database system.

3. Optional services for an onramp Gateway


3.1 Example of User authorization

   Onramp gateway MAY have a user authorization function to confirm that 
   they are the data that suitable user transmitted.

   Example of user "authorization" by "DTMF", GSTN user might send "user-ID",
   "password" data after destination "gstn-phone"
   (Dual Tone Multi Frequency).
   DTMF Data format is shown in the following.
   "*" is separater, "#" is terminater.
   gstn-phone defined in section 2 of [RFC2846].
   DTMF defined in section 2.1 of [RFC2846].

   authorization = 1*DTMF
   authorization = gstn-phone "*" user-ID "*" password "#"
   user-ID = 1*( DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" )
   password = 1*( DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" )

   example
   8155551234*81467745523*98765# is detect by DTMF
   Each data are extracted as follows, and user authorization is done.
   Destination facsimile number : 8155551234
   User ID : 81467745523
   Password : 98765

3.2 keep log

   An onramp gateway MAY have the function that following information is kept 
   as log.
   For security and message trace,
   The Internet FAX gateway MAY use the format of a system log or an event
   log of the Operation System.

   - date and time when transmit request received
   - source address
   - destination address
   - date and time when transmit over GSTN
   - date and time when transmission was finished over GSTN
   - date and time when transmission over Internet
   - number of real transmitted page
   - byte count of transmitted data
   - kind of the data (resolution)
   - existence of error occurrence
   - number of automatically retry sending
   - date and time of transmitting delivery notice

Internet Draft       Guideline of optional services             May 2001
                        for Internet FAX Gateway

   The log information preservation function aims at mainly becoming
   a help of security or Charge calculation processing.

   When the hardware system equipped with some recording media 
   (HDD, FDD, etc.)is used, the log information SHOULD be saved as
   a log file. 

   The opportunity which saves log information can consider three of 
   the following.
   
   1) When an onramp gateway receives a distribution demand.
   2) When an onramp gateway starts distribution.
   3) When an onramp gateway ends distribution.

   When the hardware system without a certain recording medium is used, 
   log information cannot be saved locally. In this case, it is desirable 
   to hold the function saved at other PCs using the existing network 
   communication means, such as a function to save log information as 
   a file using a Network File System, and SMTP, SNMP, or the function 
   printed out periodically. 

   In order to strengthen security, it is desirable to save log information 
   in the Internet Fax Gateway using a database system. 

4. Security Considerations

   Offramp and Onramp gateway MAY have a user authorization
   function to confirm that they are the data that suitable user
   transmitted.
   Encryption of  facsimile data is performed by the existing
   SMTP, such as S/MIME, using the possible security technique.

   The Security Considerations sections of [RFC2305] applies to this 
   document.
   Further security considerations are introduced by this document, but
   they will be described in this section prior to publication as an RFC.
