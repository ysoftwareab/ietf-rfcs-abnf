INTERNET DRAFT   RTP Payload Format for the MELPe CodecSeptember 22, 2015


1  Introduction

   This document describes how compressed MELPe speech as produced by
   the MELPe codec may be formatted for use as an RTP payload.  Details
   are provided to packetize the three different codec bit-rate data
   frames (2400, 1200, and 600) into RTP packets. The sender may send
   one or more codec data frames per packet, depending on the
   application scenario or based on the transport network condition,
   bandwidth restriction, delay requirements and packet-loss tolerance.


1.1  Conventions, Definitions and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Background


   The MELP speech coder was developed by the US military as an upgrade
   from LPC-based CELP standard vocoder for low bit-rate communications
   [MELP].  MELP was further enhanced and subsequently adopted by NATO
   as MELPe for use by its members and Partnership for Peace countries
   for military and other governmental communications [MELPE]. 
   Commercial/civilian applications have arisen because of the low bit-
   rate property of MELPe with its (relatively) high intelligibility. 
   As such MELPe is being used in a variety of wired and radio
   communications systems.  VoIP/SIP systems need to transport MELPe
   without decoding and re-encoding in order to preserve its
   intelligibility.  Hence it is desirable and necessary to define the
   proper payload formatting and use conventions of MELPe in RTP
   payloads.

   The MELPe codec [MELPE] supports three different vocoder bit rates;
   2400, 1200, and 600 bps.  The basic 2400 bps bit-rate vocoder uses a
   22.5 ms frame of speech consisting of 180 8000 Hz, 16-bit speech
   samples.  The 1200 and 600 bps bit-rate vocoders uses respectively
   three and four 22.5 ms frames of speech each.  These reduced bit-rate
   vocoders internally use multiple 2400 bps parameter sets with further
   processing to strategically remove redundancy.  The payload sizes for
   each of the bitrates are 54, 81, and 54 bits respectively for the
   2400, 1200, and 600 bps frames.  Dynamic bit-rate switching is
   permitted but only if supported by both endpoints.

   The MELPe algorithm distinguishes between voiced and un-voiced speech
   and encodes each differently.  Unvoiced speech can be coded with

   fewer information bits for the same quality.  Forward error
   correction (FEC) is applied to the 2400 bps codec unvoiced speech for
   better protection of the subtle differences in signal reconstruction.
   The lower bit-rate coders do not allocate any bits for FEC and rely
   on strong error protection and correction in the communications
   channel.

   Comfort noise handling for MELPe is recommended to follow SCIP-210
   Appendix B [SCIP210].  After VAD no longer indicates the presence of
   speech/voice, a grace period of a minimum of two comfort noise
   vocoder fames are to be transmitted. The contents of the comfort
   noise frames is described in the next section.

   Packet loss concealment (PLC) exploits the FEC (and more precisely,
   any combination of two set bits in the pitch/voicing parameter) of
   the 2400 bps speech coder.  The pitch/voicing parameter has a sparse
   set of permitted values.  A value of zero indicates a non-voiced
   frame.  At least three bits are set for all valid pitch parameters. 
   The PLC erasure indication utilizes any of the two bit set
   errored/erasure encodings of a non-voiced frame as will be described
   infra.


3  Payload Format

   The MELPe codec uses 22.5, 67.5 or 90 ms frames with a sampling rate
   clock of 8 kHz, so the RTP timestamp MUST be in units of 1/8000 of a
   second.

   The RTP payload for MELPe has the format shown in the figure below. 
   No additional header specific to this payload format is required. 

   This format is intended for the situations where the sender and the
   receiver send one or more codec data frames per packet. The RTP
   packet looks as follows:


   0                   1                   2                   3 
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                         RTP Header                            |

   |                                                               | 
   +                  one or more frames of MELPe                  | 
   |                                                               |

   The RTP header of the packetized encoded MELPe speech has the
   expected values as described in [RFC3550].  The usage of M bit SHOULD
   be as specified in the applicable RTP profile, for example, RFC 3551
   [RFC3551], where [RFC3551] specifies that if the sender does not
   suppress silence (i.e., sends a frame on every frame interval), the M
   bit will always be zero. When more then one codec data frame is
   present in a single RTP packet, the timestamp is, as always, that of
   the oldest data frame represented in the RTP packet. 

   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet format is
   outside the scope of this document, and will not be specified here. 
   It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular class of
   applications will assign a payload type for this encoding, or if that
   is not done, then a payload type in the dynamic range shall be chosen
   by the sender. 


3.1  MELPe Bitstream Definition 

   The total number of bits used to describe one frame of 2400 bps
   speech is 54, which fits in 7 octets (with two unused bits). For the
   1200 bps speech the total number of bits used is 81, which fits in 11
   octets (with seven unused bits). For the 600 bps speech the total
   number of bits used is 54, which fits in 7 octets (with two unused
   bits).  Unused bits are coded as described in 3.3 in support of
   dynamic bit-rate switching.

   In the MELPe bitstream definition, the most significant bits are
   considered priority bits.  The intention was that these bits receive
   greater protection in the underlying communications channel.  For IP
   networks, such additional protection is irrelevant.  However, for
   convenience of interoperable gateway devices, the bitstreams will be
   presented identically in IP networks.


3.1.1 2400 bps Bitstream Structure

   According to Table 3 of [MELPE], the 2400 bit/s MELPe bit
   transmission order (bit priority is not shown for clarity) is the
   following:


          +--------+-------------+-------------+
          |  Bit   |    Voiced   |   Unvoiced  |
          +--------+-------------+-------------+

          |  B_02  |       BP0   |     FEC10   |
          |  B_03  |        P0   |        P0   |

3.3  Multiple MELPe frames in a RTP packet 

   A MELPe RTP packet may consist of zero or more MELPe coder frames,
   followed by zero or one MELPe Comfort Noise frames.  The presence of
   a comfort noise frame can be deduced from the length of the RTP
   payload.  The default packetization interval is one coder frame
   (22.5, 67.5 or 90 ms) according to the coder bit rate (2400, 1200 or
   600 bps).  For some applications, a longer packetization interval may
   be required to reduce the packet rate.

   All MELPe frames in a single RTP packet MUST be of the same coder bit
   rate. Dynamic switching between frame rates within an RTP stream may
   be permitted (if supported by both ends) provided that reserved bits,
   RSVA, RSVB, and RSVC are filled in as per Table 3.6.  If bit-rate
   switching is not used, all reserved bits are encoded as 0 by the

   Table 3.6 - MELPe Frame Bit Rate Indicators.


   It is important to observe that senders have the following additional
   restrictions:

   Senders SHOULD NOT include more MELPe frames in a single RTP packet
   than will fit in the MTU of the RTP transport protocol. 

   Frames MUST NOT be split between RTP packets. 

   It is RECOMMENDED that the number of frames contained within an RTP
   packet is consistent with the application.  For example, in a
   telephony and other real time applications where delay is important,
   then the fewer frames per packet the lower the delay, whereas for
   bandwidth constrained links or delay insensitive streaming messaging
   application, more than one or many frames per packet would be
   acceptable.

   Information describing the number of frames contained in an RTP
   packet is not transmitted as part of the RTP payload.  The way to
   determine the number of MELPe frames is to count the total number of
   octets within the RTP packet, and divide the octet count by the
   number of expected octets per frame (7/11/7 per frame).  Keep in mind
   the last frame may be a 2 octet comfort noise frame.   

   When dynamic bit-rate switching is used and more than one frame is
   contained in a RTP packet, it is recommended to inspect the coder
   rate bits contained in the last octet.  If the coder bit rate
   indicates a Comfort Noise frame, then inspect the third last octet
   for the coder bit rate.  All MELPe speech frames in the RTP packet
   will be of this same coder bit rate.

3.4  Congestion Control Considerations

   Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RFC 3550
   [RFC3550], and with any applicable RTP profile; e.g., RFC 3551
   [RFC3551].  An additional requirement if best-effort service is being
   used is: users of this payload format MUST monitor packet loss to
   ensure that the packet loss rate is within acceptable parameters. 
   Circuit Breakers [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers] is an update
   to RTP [RFC3550] that defines criteria for when one is required to
   stop sending RTP Packet Streams.  The circuit breakers is to be
   implemented and followed.

4.2  Mapping to SDP

   The mapping of the above defined payload format media type and its
   parameters SHALL be done according to Section 3 of RFC 4855
   [RFC4855].

   The information carried in the MIME media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC2327], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP
   is used to specify sessions employing the MELPe codec, the mapping is
   as follows: 

   	 o The MIME type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name. 
   	 o The MIME subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as
   the encoding name. 
   	 o The parameter "bitrate" goes in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by
   copying it directly from the MIME media type string as
   "bitrate=value" or "bitrate=value1,value2" or
   "bitrate=value1,value2,value3".

   When conveying information by SDP, the encoding name SHALL be "MELP"
   (the same as the MIME subtype).  Alternative encoding name types,
   "MELP2400", "MELP1200", and "MELP600", may be used in SDP to convey
   fixed bit-rate configurations.  These names have been observed in
   systems that do not support dynamic frame rate switching as specified
   by the parameter, "bitrate".

   An example of the media representation in SDP for describing MELPe
   might be: 

    m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97 
 


Demjanenko, Satterlee    Expires March 25, 2016                [Page 20]

INTERNET DRAFT   RTP Payload Format for the MELPe CodecSeptember 22, 2015


    a=rtpmap:97 MELP/8000 

   An alternative example of SDP for fixed bit-rate configurations might
   be:

    m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97 100 101 102
    a=rtpmap:97 MELP/8000 
    a=rtpmap:100 MELP2400/8000 
    a=rtpmap:101 MELP1200/8000 
    a=rtpmap:102 MELP600/8000 

   If the encoding name "MELP" is received without a "bitrate"
   parameter, the fixed coder bit rate of 2400 MUST be used.  The
   alternate encoding names, "MELP2400", "MELP1200", and "MELP600"
   directly specify the MELPe coder bit rate of 2400, 1200, and 600
   respectively and MUST NOT specify a "bitrate" parameter.

   A remote MELPe encoder SHALL receive "bitrate" parameter in the SDP
   "a=fmtp" attribute by copying them directly from the MIME media type
   string as a semicolon separated with parameter=value, where parameter
   is "bitrate", and value can be one or more of 2400, 1200, and 600
   separated by commas (where each bit-rate value indicates the
   corresponding MELPe coder). An example of the media representation in
   SDP for describing MELPe when all three coder bit rates are supported
   might be: 

    m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97 
    a=rtpmap:97 MELP/8000 
    a=fmtp:97 bitrate=2400,600,1200

   For streaming media, the "bitrate" parameter specifes the possible
   bit rates used by the sender.  In an Offer/Answer mode [RFC3264],
   "bitrate" is a bi-directional parameter.  Both sides MUST use a
   common "bitrate" value or values. 

   The offer contains the bit rates supported by the offerer listed in
   its preferred order.  The answerer may agree to any bit rate by
   listing the bit rate first in the answerer response.  Additionally
   the answerer may indicate any secondary bit rate or bit rates that it
   supports.  The initial bit rate used by both parties SHALL be the
   first bit rate specified in the answerer response. 

   For example if offerer bit rates are "2400,600", and answer bit rates
   are "600,2400", the initial bit rate is 600.  If other bit rates are
   provided by the answerer, any common bit rate between offer and
   answer may be used at any time in the future.  Activation of these
   other common bit rates is beyond the scope of this document.

   The use of a lower bit rate is often important for a case such as
   when one end point utilizes a bandwidth constrained link (e.g. 1200
   bps radio link or slower), where only the lower coder bit rate will
   work.

   Parameter ptime can not be used for the purpose of specifying MELPe
   operating mode, due to fact that for the certain values it will be
   impossible to distinguish which mode is about to be used (e.g. when
   ptime=68, it would be impossible to distinguish if packet is carrying
   1 frames of 67.5 ms or 3 frames of 22.5 ms etc.). 

   When SDP is used for broadcast MELPe audio, multiple MELPe rtpmap
   values (such as 97, 98, and 99 as used below) may be used to convey
   MELPe coded voice at different bit rates.  The receiver can then
   select an appropriate MELPe codec by using 97, 98, or 99.

    m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97 98 99
    a=rtpmap:97 MELP/8000 
    a=fmtp:97 bitrate=2400
    a=rtpmap:98 MELP/8000 
    a=fmtp:98 bitrate=1200
    a=rtpmap:99 MELP/8000 
    a=fmtp:99 bitrate=600

   Note that the payload format (encoding) names are commonly shown in
   upper case. MIME subtypes are commonly shown in lower case.  These
   names are case-insensitive in both places.  Similarly, parameter
   names are case-insensitive both in media subtype name and in the
   default mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute 

   The value for "packet time" and "maximum packet time" parameters of
   the "ptime" and "maxptime" SDP attributes respectively, SHALL use the
   nearest rounded-up ms integer packet duration.  For MELPe, this
   corresponds to the values: 23, 45, 68, 90, 112, 135, 156, and 180. 
   Larger values may be used as long as they are properly rounded.


5  Discontinious Transmission 

   A primary application of MELPe is for radio communications of voice
   conversations and discontinuous transmissions are normal.  When MELPe
   is used in an IP network, MELPe RTP packet transmissions may cease
   and resume frequently.  RTP SSRC sequence number gaps indicate lost
   packets to be filled by PLC while abrupt loss of RTP packets indicate
   intended discontinuous transmission.

   If a MELPe coder so desires, it may send a comfort noise frame as per
   SCIP-210 Appendix B [SCIP210] prior to ceasing transmission.  A

   receiver may optionally use comfort noise during its silence periods.
   No SDP negotiations are required.


6  Packet Loss Concealment 

   MELPe packet loss concealment (PLC) uses the special properties and
   coding for the pitch/voicing parameter of the MELPe 2400 bps coder. 
   The PLC erasure indication may utilize any of the errored encodings
   of a non-voiced frame as identified in Table 1 of [MELPE].  For the
   sake of simplicity it is recommended to use a code value of 3 for the
   pitch/voicing parameter (represented by the bits P6 to P0 in Table
   3.1).  Hence, set bits P0 and P1 to one and bits P2, P3, P4, P5, and
   P6 to zero.

   When using PLC in a 1200 bps or 600 bps mode, the MELPe 2400 bps
   decoder is called three or four times respectively to cover the loss
   of a MELPe frame.

7  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests that IANA registers MELP, MELP2400, MELP1200, and
   MELP600 as specified in Section 4.1.  The media type is also
   requested to be added to the IANA registry for "RTP Payload Format
   MIME types" (http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtp-parameters).


8  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550] , and in any applicable RTP profile such as
   RTP/AVP [RFC3551], RTP/AVPF [RFC4585], RTP/SAVP [RFC3711] or RTP/
   SAVPF [RFC5124].  However, as "Securing the RTP Protocol Framework:
   Why RTP Does Not Mandate a Single Media Security Solution" [RFC7202]
   discusses, it is not an RTP payload format's responsibility to
   discuss or mandate what solutions are used to meet the basic security
   goals like confidentiality, integrity and source authenticity for RTP
   in general. This responsibility lays on anyone using RTP in an
   application.  They can find guidance on available security mechanisms
   and important considerations in Options for Securing RTP Sessions
   [RFC7201].  Applications SHOULD use one or more appropriate strong
   security mechanisms.  The rest of this security consideration section
   discusses the security impacting properties of the payload format
   itself.

   This RTP payload format and its media decoder do not exhibit any
   significant non-uniformity in the receiver-side computational
   complexity for packet processing, and thus are unlikely to pose a
   denial-of-service threat due to the receipt of pathological data. 
   Nor does the RTP payload format contain any active content.
