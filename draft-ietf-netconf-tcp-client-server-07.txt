1.  Introduction

   This document defines three YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] modules to support the
   configuration of TCP clients and TCP servers, either as standalone or
   in conjunction with a stack protocol layer specific configurations.

1.1.  Relation to other RFCs

   This document presents one or more YANG modules [RFC7950] that are
   part of a collection of RFCs that work together to define
   configuration modules for clients and servers of both the NETCONF
   [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040] protocols.

   The modules have been defined in a modular fashion to enable their
   use by other efforts, some of which are known to be in progress at
   the time of this writing, with many more expected to be defined in
   time.

   The relationship between the various RFCs in the collection is
   presented in the below diagram.  The labels in the diagram represent
   the primary purpose provided by each RFC.  Links the each RFC are
   provided below the diagram.

1.2.  Specification Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Adherence to the NMDA

   This document in compliant with the Network Management Datastore
   Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  It does not define any protocol
   accessible nodes that are "config false".

2.  The "ietf-tcp-common" Module

2.1.  Data Model Overview

2.1.1.  Model Scope

   This document defines a common "grouping" statement for basic TCP
   connection parameters that matter to applications.  In some TCP
   stacks, such parameters can also directly be set by an application
   using system calls, such as the socket API.  The base YANG model in
   this document focuses on modeling TCP keep-alives.  This base model
   can be extended as needed.

2.1.2.  Features

   The following diagram lists all the "feature" statements defined in
   the "ietf-tcp-common" module:

   Features:
     +-- keepalives-supported

2.1.3.  Groupings

   The following diagram lists all the "grouping" statements defined in
   the "ietf-keystore" module:

   Groupings:
     +-- tcp-common-grouping
     +-- tcp-connection-grouping

   Each of these groupings are presented in the following subsections.

2.1.3.1.  The "tcp-common-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "tcp-common-
   grouping" grouping:

     grouping tcp-common-grouping
       +-- keepalives! {keepalives-supported}?
          +-- idle-time         uint16
          +-- max-probes        uint16
          +-- probe-interval    uint16

   Comments:

   *  The "keepalives" node is a "presence" node so that the decendent
      nodes' "mandatory true" doesn't imply that keepalives must be
      configured.

   *  The "idle-time", "max-probes", and "probe-interval" nodes have the
      common meanings.  Please see the YANG module in Section 2.3 for
      details.

2.1.3.2.  The "tcp-connection-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "tcp-connection-
   grouping" grouping:

     grouping tcp-connection-grouping
       +---u tcp-common-grouping

   Comments:

   *  This grouping uses the "tcp-common-grouping" grouping discussed in
      Section 2.1.3.1.

2.1.4.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-tcp-common" module does not contain any protocol-accessible
   nodes.

2.1.5.  Guidelines for Configuring TCP Keep-Alives

   Network stacks may include "keep-alives" in their TCP
   implementations, although this practice is not universally accepted.
   If keep-alives are included, [RFC1122] [RFC793bis] mandates that the
   application MUST be able to turn them on or off for each TCP
   connection, and that they MUST default to off.





Watsen & Scharf          Expires 9 January 2021                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TCP Clients and Servers        July 2020


   Keep-alive mechanisms exist in many protocols.  Depending on the
   protocol stack, TCP keep-alives may only be one out of several
   alternatives.  Which mechanism(s) to use depends on the use case and
   application requirements.  If keep-alives are needed by an
   application, it is RECOMMENDED that the aliveness check happens only
   at the protocol layers that are meaningful to the application.

   A TCP keep-alive mechanism SHOULD only be invoked in server
   applications that might otherwise hang indefinitely and consume
   resources unnecessarily if a client crashes or aborts a connection
   during a network failure [RFC1122].  TCP keep-alives may consume
   significant resources both in the network and in endpoints (e.g.,
   battery power).  In addition, frequent keep-alives risk network
   congestion.  The higher the frequency of keep-alives, the higher the
   overhead.

   Given the cost of keep-alives, parameters have to be configured
   carefully:

   *  The default idle interval (leaf "idle-time") MUST default to no
      less than two hours, i.e., 7200 seconds [RFC1122].  A lower value
      MAY be configured, but keep-alive messages SHOULD NOT be
      transmitted more frequently than once every 15 seconds.  Longer
      intervals SHOULD be used when possible.

   *  The maximum number of sequential keep-alive probes that can fail
      (leaf "max-probes") trades off responsiveness and robustness
      against packet loss.  ACK segments that contain no data are not
      reliably transmitted by TCP.  Consequently, if a keep-alive
      mechanism is implemented it MUST NOT interpret failure to respond
      to any specific probe as a dead connection [RFC1122].  Typically a
      single-digit number should suffice.

   *  TCP implementations may include a parameter for the number of
      seconds between TCP keep-alive probes (leaf "probe-interval").  In
      order to avoid congestion, the time interval between probes MUST
      NOT be smaller than one second.  Significantly longer intervals
      SHOULD be used.  It is important to note that keep-alive probes
      (or replies) can get dropped due to network congestion.  Sending
      further probe messages into a congested path after a short
      interval, without backing off timers, could cause harm and result
      in a congestion collapse.  Therefore it is essential to pick a
      large, conservative value for this interval.

2.2.  Example Usage

   This section presents an example showing the "tcp-common-grouping"
   populated with some data.

   Comments:

   *  The "remote-address" node, which is mandatory, may be configured
      as an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, a hostname.

   *  The "remote-port" node is not mandatory, but its default value is
      the invalid value '0', thus forcing the consuming data model to
      refine it in order to provide it an appropriate default value.

   *  The "local-address" node, which is enabled by the "local-binding-
      supported" feature (Section 2.1.2), may be configured as an IPv4
      address, an IPv6 address, or a wildcard value.

   *  The "local-port" node, which is enabled by the "local-binding-
      supported" feature (Section 2.1.2), is not mandatory.  Its default
      value is '0', indicating that the operating system can pick an
      arbitrary port number.

   *  The "proxy-server" node is enabled by a "feature" statement and,
      for servers that enable it, is a "presence" container so that the
      decendent "mandatory true" choice node doesn't imply that the
      proxt-server node must be configured.

   *  This grouping uses the "tcp-connection-grouping" grouping
      discussed in Section 2.1.3.2.

3.1.3.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-tcp-client" module does not contain any protocol-accessible
   nodes.

3.2.  Example Usage

   This section presents an example showing the "tcp-client-grouping"
   populated with some data.

   <tcp-client xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-client">
     <remote-address>www.example.com</remote-address>
     <remote-port>443</remote-port>
     <local-address>0.0.0.0</local-address>
     <local-port>0</local-port>
     <keepalives>
       <idle-time>15</idle-time>
       <max-probes>3</max-probes>
       <probe-interval>30</probe-interval>
     </keepalives>
   </tcp-client>

3.3.  YANG Module

   The ietf-tcp-client YANG module references [RFC6991].

   <CODE BEGINS> file "ietf-tcp-client@2020-07-08.yang"

4.1.2.1.  The "tcp-server-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "tcp-server-
   grouping" grouping:

     grouping tcp-server-grouping
       +-- local-address                     inet:ip-address
       +-- local-port?                       inet:port-number
       +---u tcpcmn:tcp-connection-grouping

   Comments:

   *  The "local-address" node, which is mandatory, may be configured as
      an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a wildcard value.

   *  The "local-port" node is not mandatory, but its default value is
      the invalid value '0', thus forcing the consuming data model to
      refine it in order to provide it an appropriate default value.

   *  This grouping uses the "tcp-connection-grouping" grouping
      discussed in Section 2.1.3.2.

4.1.3.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-tcp-server" module does not contain any protocol-accessible
   nodes.

4.2.  Example Usage

   This section presents an example showing the "tcp-server-grouping"
   populated with some data.

   <tcp-server xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-server">
     <local-address>10.20.30.40</local-address>
     <local-port>7777</local-port>
     <keepalives>
       <idle-time>15</idle-time>
       <max-probes>3</max-probes>
       <probe-interval>30</probe-interval>
     </keepalives>
   </tcp-server>

4.3.  YANG Module

   The ietf-tcp-server YANG module references [RFC6991].

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  The "ietf-tcp-common" YANG Module

   The "ietf-tcp-common" YANG module defines "grouping" statements that
   are designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols, such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols
   have mandatory-to-implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS)
   with mutual authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the module in this document only define groupings, these
   considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules that
   use these groupings.

   None of the readable data nodes defined in this YANG module are
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.  The NACM
   "default-deny-all" extension has not been set for any data nodes
   defined in this module.

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TCP Clients and Servers        July 2020


   None of the writable data nodes defined in this YANG module are
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.  The NACM
   "default-deny-write" extension has not been set for any data nodes
   defined in this module.

   This module does not define any RPCs, actions, or notifications, and
   thus the security consideration for such is not provided here.

5.2.  The "ietf-tcp-client" YANG Module

   The "ietf-tcp-client" YANG module defines "grouping" statements that
   are designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols, such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols
   have mandatory-to-implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS)
   with mutual authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the module in this document only define groupings, these
   considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules that
   use these groupings.

   One readable data node defined in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  This node is
   as follows:

   *  The "proxy-server/socks5-parameters/authentication-parameters/
      username-password/password" node:

         The cleartext "password" node defined in the "tcp-client-
         grouping" grouping is additionally sensitive to read operations
         such that, in normal use cases, it should never be returned to
         a client.  For this reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-
         all" has been applied to it.

   None of the writable data nodes defined in this YANG module are
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.  The NACM
   "default-deny-write" extension has not been set for any data nodes
   defined in this module.

   This module does not define any RPCs, actions, or notifications, and
   thus the security consideration for such is not provided here.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document registers two URIs in the "ns" subregistry of the IETF
   XML Registry [RFC3688].  Following the format in [RFC3688], the
   following registrations are requested:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-client
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
