                      draft-trammell-plus-spec-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a common Path Layer UDP Substrate (PLUS) wire
   image for encrypted transport protocols carried over UDP.  The base
   PLUS header carries information for driving a minimal state machine
   at middleboxes described in [I-D.trammell-plus-statefulness], and
   provides optional exposure of additional information to devices along
   the path using the mechanism described in
   [I-D.trammell-plus-abstract-mech].

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a wire image for a Path Layer UDP Substrate
   (PLUS), for limited exposure of information from encrypted, UDP-
   encapsulated [RFC0768] transport protocols.  The wire image
   implements signaling to drive the minimal state machine defined in
   [I-D.trammell-plus-statefulness] as well as optional exposure of
   additional information to devices along the path using the mechanism
   described in [I-D.trammell-plus-abstract-mech].

   As discussed in [I-D.hardie-path-signals], basic information about
   flows currently exposed by TCP are missing from transport protocols
   that encrypt their headers.  Given the ossification of protocol wire
   images due to the widespread deployment of stateful network devices
   that rely on header inspection, this header encryption is necessary
   to support transport protocol evolution.  However, the loss of basic
   information for on-path state maintenance as well as network
   performance measurement, diagnostics, and troubleshooting via header
   encryption makes network management more difficult.  The PLUS wire
   image defined by this document aims to mitigate this difficulty,

   allowing deployment of encrypted protocols without loss of essential
   in- network functionality.

   This wire image is intended primarily to support state maintenance
   and measurement; the principles of measurement and primitives we aim
   to support are drawn from recent work on explicit measurability in
   protocol design [IPIM].

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this
   document.  It's not shouting; when these words are capitalized, they
   have a special meaning as defined in [RFC2119].

2.  State Maintenance and Measurement: Basic Header

   Every packet in each direction of a flow using PLUS carries a PLUS
   header.  This can be either a basic header, or an extended header.
   The PLUS basic header supports multiplexing using a connection token;
   basic state maintenance using association and confirmation signals,
   packet serial numbers, and a two-way stop signal; and basic
   measurability using packet serial number echo.  The format of the
   basic header, together with the UDP header, is shown in Figure 1.

   The extended header is defined in Section 3.

   Fields are encoded in network byte order and are defined as follows:

   o  magic: A 28-bit number identifying this packet as carrying a PLUS
      header.  This magic number is chosen to avoid collision with
      possible values of the first four bytes of widely deployed
      protocols on UDP.  The value 0xd8007ff has been provisionally
      selected for the PLUS magic number based of experience with the
      SPUD prototype, a cursory survey of common UDP protocols, and
      compatibility with [RFC8035].

   o  flags: four bits carrying additional information:

      *  LoLa flag (L): Packet is latency sensitive and prefers drop to
         delay when set.

      *  RoI flag (R): Packet is not sensitive to reordering when set.

      *  Stop flag (S): Packet carries a stop or stop confirmation when
         set.

      *  Extended Header bit: Flag bit 0x01 is zero in packets with a
         Basic Header.

   o  Connection/Association Token (CAT): A 64-bit token identifying
      this association.  The CAT should be chosen randomly by the
      connection initiator.  The CAT performs two functions in the PLUS
      header:

      *  Multiplexing: PLUS packets on the same 5-tuple with a different
         CAT value are taken to belong to a separate flow, with
         completely separate state.

      *  Rebinding: A PLUS packet sharing one endpoint (source address/
         port pair, or destination address/port pair) and the CAT with
         an existing flow is taken to belong to that flow, since the
         other endpoint identifier has changed due to a mobility event
         or address translation change.

   o  Packet Serial Number (PSN): A 32-bit serial number for this
      packet.  The first PSN for each direction in a flow is chosen
      randomly, and subsequent packets increment the PSN by one.  The
      PSN wraps around.

   o  Packet Serial Echo (PSE): The most recent PSN seen by the sender
      in the opposite direction before this packet was sent.

   Since PLUS is designed to be used for UDP-encapsulated, encrypted
   transport protocols, overlying transports are presumed to provide

Internet-Draft                  PLUS Spec                     March 2017


   encryption and integrity protection for their own headers.  For the
   sake of efficiency, it is also assumed that this integrity protection
   can be extended to the bits in the PLUS Basic Header.

2.1.  Sender Behavior

   When a sender has a packet ready to send using PLUS, it determines
   the values in the Basic Header as follows:

   o  The magic number is set to the constant 0xd8007ff.

   o  If the sender is the flow initiator, and the packet is the first
      packet in the flow, the sender selects a cryptographically random
      64-bit number for the CAT.  When multiplexing, it must ensure the
      CAT is not already in use for the 5-tuple.  Otherwise, the sender
      uses the CAT associated with the flow.

   o  If the packet is the first packet in the flow in this direction,
      the sender selects a cryptographically random 32-bit number for
      the PSN.  Otherwise, the sender adds one to the PSN on the last
      packet it sent in this flow, and uses that value for the PSN.  If
      the last PSN is 0xffffffff, it wraps around, setting the PSN to
      0x00000001.  A PSN of 0x00000000 is never sent.

   o  If the packet is the first packet in the flow in this direction,
      the sender sets the PSE to 0x00000000.  Otherwise it sets the PSE
      to the PSN of the last packet seen in the opposite direction.

   o  If the overlying transport determines that this packet is loss-
      insensitive but latency-sensitive, the sender sets the L flag.

   o  If the overlying transport determines that this packet may be
      freely reordered, the sender sets the R flag.

   o  If the overlying transport determines that the connection is
      shutting down, and no further packets will be sent in this
      direction other than packets part of this shutdown, the sender
      sets the S flag; see Section 2.3.2 for details.

2.2.  Receiver Behavior

   When a receiver receives a packet containing a PLUS Basic Header, it
   processes the values in the Basic Header as follows:

   o  It verifies that the magic number is the constant 0xd800fff.  If
      the receiver is expecting a PLUS packet, and it does not see this
      value, it drops the packet without further processing.

Internet-Draft                  PLUS Spec                     March 2017


   o  It verifies the integrity of the information in the PLUS Basic
      Header, using information carried in the overlying transport.
      Packets failing integrity checks SHOULD be dropped, but MAY be
      further analyzed by the receiver to determine the likely cause of
      verification failure; reaction to the failure is transport and
      implementation specific.

   o  It stores the PSN to be sent as the PSE on the the next packet it
      sends in the opposite direction.

2.3.  On-Path State Maintenance using the Basic Header

   The basic header provides all the signals necessary to drive the
   transport- independent state machine described in
   [I-D.trammell-plus-statefulness], as shown in Figure 2.

2.3.1.  State Establishment

   On the first packet with a PLUS header forwarded by an on-path device
   for a given 5-tuple plus CAT, the device moves that flow from the
   zero state to the uniflow state.  The device retuens the flow to zero
   state after not seeing a packet on the same flow in the same
   direction with the same CAT within a timeout interval TO_IDLE.
   Otherwise, it stays in uniflow state and continues forwarding
   packets, as long as it only observes packets in the same direction as
   the initial packet. (the a->b direction in Figure 2).

Internet-Draft                  PLUS Spec                     March 2017


   A PLUS-aware on-path device forwarding a packet with a PLUS header
   with a reversed 5-tuple and identical CAT (the b->a direction in
   Figure 2) to a flow in the uniflow state, moves that flow to the
   associating state.  It then waits to see a packet with a PSE in the
   a->b direction equal to the PSN on the first reverse packet; on
   receipt of this packet, the device moves the flow to associated
   state.  Otherwise, it drops state after a timeout interval TO_IDLE.

   Once a flow has moved to the associated state, it will remain in that
   state for a timeout interval TO_ASSOCIATED.  The on-path device
   forwards any packet with a PLUS header in either direction for this
   flow.  It resets the TO_ASSOCIATED timer for every packet it forwards
   in this state.

2.3.2.  Bidirectional Stop Signaling

   A PLUS-aware on-path device forwarding a packet for a flow in the
   associated state with an S flag set moves that flow to stop-wait
   state.  It stores the PSN on the packet causing the transition, and
   continues forwarding packets as if in associated state, dropping
   state on timeout interval TO_ASSOCIATED.

   When it sees a packet in the opposite direction with the S flag set
   and the PSE set to exactly the stored PSN, it transitions the flow to
   stopping state.  The device will forward packets in both directions
   for flows in the stopping state within a timeout interval
   TO_STOPPING; these packets will not reset the timer.

   Note that even though the S flag is integrity-protected end to end, a
   packet with the S flag set could be forged by one on-path device to
   drive the flow into stop-wait state on all downstream devices.
   However, this forgery is of severely limited utility.  First, it
   would require coordination between attackers on both sides of a given
   on-path device in order to forge a confirmation of the stop signal -
   a flag with the S bit set and a valid PSE corresponding to the PSN of
   the first stop signal to drive the flow into stopping state.  Second,
   the information in the Basic Header on each packet will drive the
   state machine into associated state even in the middle of a flow,
   enabling fast recovery even in the case of such a coordinated attack.

2.3.3.  State Rebinding

   One end of a PLUS association may change its address while
   maintaining on-path state; e.g. due to a NAT change.  A PLUS-aware
   on-path device that forwards a packet for a flow in the zero state,
   where one of the endpoint identifiers (address and port) and the CAT,
   but not the other endpoint identifier, match a flow in a non-zero




Trammell & Kuehlewind  Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  PLUS Spec                     March 2017


   state, treats that packet as belonging to the existing flow, and
   updates the endpoint identifier.

2.4.  Measurement and Diagnosis using the Basic Header

   The basic header trivially supports passive two-way delay measurement
   as well as partial loss estimation at a single observation point on
   path.

   To calculate two-way delay, an observation point calculates the delay
   between seeing a PSN and a corresponding PSE in each direction, then
   adds the delays from each direction together.  The fact that the PSN
   increments by one for every packet makes this measurement much
   simpler than the equivalent measurement using TCP sequence and
   acknowledgment numbers.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: specify this fully.]

   Loss and reordering upstream from an observation point in each
   direction can be estimated through examination of the PSN sequence
   observed.  A skipped PSN not seen within a specified interval can be
   counted as a lost packet, and the extent of reordering estimated by
   the degree of skipping seen in those skipped PSNs that are later
   observed.  Since PLUS does not expose information about
   retransmissions (and, indeed, may not even carry a transport that
   uses retransmission for loss recovery), loss downstream from the
   observation point cannot be observed.

3.  Path Communication: Extended Header

   Additional facilities for communicating with on-path devices under
   endpoint control are provided by the PLUS Extended Header.  The
   extended header shares the layout of its first 20 bytes with the PLUS
   Basic Header, except the Extended Header bit (0x01 on byte 11) is
   set.  As with the Basic Header, overlying transports are presumed to
   provide encryption and integrity protection for the PLUS Extended
   Header.  The Extended Header has a 1-byte type field, a 6-bit length
   field, a 2-bit Integrity indicator, and variable-length value field
   for the Path Communication Function (PCF):

   o  PCF Type: a 1-byte value defining the type and semantics of the
      PCF value.  Types 0x00 and 0xff are special and further explained
      below.

   o  PDF Integrity indication field: a 2-bit field indicating how much
      of the PCF value field is integrity protected:

      *  00: the PCF field is not integrity protected.

      *  01: the first quarter of the PCF value field is integrity
         protected, rounded up to the nearest bit.

      *  10: the first half of the PCF value field is integrity
         protected, rounded up to the nearest bit.

      *  11: the whole PCF field is integrity protected.

   o  PCF Length: a 6-bit field indicating the length of the variable
      length value field.

              Figure 3: PLUS extended header with 1-byte PCF

   The extended header is generally used to expose or request
   information from/to the path.  If the value field is integrity
   protected it MUST NOT be changed by an element on the network path
   and provides only consumable information.  Non-integrity protected
   parts of the value field carry a scratch space for path elements to
   provide the requested information defined by the PCF type.  The type
   of the PCF determines the semantics of the value field and limits the

Internet-Draft                  PLUS Spec                     March 2017


   intended use of the scratch space.  A middlebox only needs to check
   for PCF types that are relevant for the function that middlebox
   provides.  Knowing the type, also means that the semantics of the
   value field are fully known.  Therefore a middlebox does not need to
   check the length and integrity field.  These field are provided for
   receiver-side handling on unknown PCF types.

   If a sender requests information from a path, these are generally
   used to expose information about the traffic for measurement or
   diagnostic purposes.  These signals generally take the form of
   accumulators: initialized to some value by the sender, and subject to
   some aggregation function by each on-path device that understands
   them.  In any case, the information sent and received is to be
   treated as advisory only, given its integrity cannot be checked.

   A PLUS receiver that receives a PLUS packet with an extended header
   and an unknown PCF type where the integrity indication is smaller
   than 11, MUST feed the non-integrity-protected part of the PCF value
   field back to the sender, using an encrypted feedback channel
   provided by the upper layer protocol.  The sender usually consumes
   this data as it has requested it previously from the path.  The
   sender SHOULD check the reasonability of the received information, as
   follows:

   o  If the information was intended to be consumed by the receiver
      instead of the sender, reflecting the receiver indicates by
      reflecting this information that the PFC is unknown.

   o  If the value field is unchanged from its initial value, this may
      indicate that there is no path element on the current path that
      supports the requested PCF.  However, as the path can change, a
      PLUS sender might re-try to requested the information at a later
      point of time or if any indication is received that the path might
      have changed.

   o  If the PCF value field has an invalid or unreasonable value
      regarding the requested PCF type, this may be an indication that
      the scratch space is misused, and the sender SHOULD NOT use this
      extended header PCF on this path anymore.

   The PCF types 0x00 and 0xff are used for special purposes. 0x00
   indicates that another 1-byte type field is followed (before the
   length and integrity indication) to provide future extensibility.
   The type 0xff indicates that that PLUS payload data follows (without
   a PDF length and integrity indication).  The semantics of this PLUS
   payload are not specified in this revision of this document but e.g.
   can be used to carry ICMP messages over PLUS.

   If the length field is zero, the integrity indication field is not
   specified and reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to zero and
   ignored by the receiver.

3.1.  Measurement and Diagnostics using the Extended Header

   We have identified the following signals that can be exposed by the
   sender as potentially useful for measurement and diagnostic purposes.
   These signals are advisory only, and should not be presumed by either
   the endpoints or devices along the path to affect forwarding
   behavior.  Details of type and encoding for these information

   o  Packet number echo delta time.  Exposes the interval between the
      receipt of the packet whose number appears in the PSE and the
      transmission of this packet, as in section 4.1.2 of [IPIM].
      Together with analysis of the PSN and PSE sequence, this allows
      high-precision RTT estimation.  The encoding of this field is TBD.

   o  Timestamp (Type 0x22, 3-byte sender to path).  Similar to TCP
      timestamps in [RFC7323], allows constant-rate clock exposure to
      devices on path.  Note that this is less necessary for RTT
      measurement of one-sided flows than it is in TCP, due to the
      properties of the PSN and PSE values in the Basic Header.
      [EDITOR'S NOTE: is this useful enough to keep?]

   o  Timestamp Echo.  Echo of the last received timestamp, as above.
      [EDITOR'S NOTE: as above, is this useful enough to keep?]

   o  Congestion Exposure.  The sender exposes the number of observed
      losses and ECN marks [RFC3168].  The path observes the information
      over time and derive information about the current whole-path
      congestion, as currently provided by counting retransmission on
      TCP, the RTCP Extended Report (XR) block for periodic ECN feedback
      [RFC6679], or ConEx for IPv6 [RFC7837].  The encoding of this
      field is TBD.

   We have identified the following signals for request from the path as
   potentially useful.  Note that accumulated values for use at the
   sender must be fed back to the sender by the overlying transport, and
   that the presence of non-PLUS aware devices on path at breaks in MTU
   mean that the accumulated value can only be used as a hint to
   processes for measurement and discovery of the accumulated values at
   the sender.

   o  State timeout accumulator: This signal allows measurement of
      timeouts from PLUS-aware devices.  It is initialized to a maximum
      ("no information") value by the sender.  A PLUS-aware forwarding
      device on path receiving this value fills in the minimum of the



Trammell & Kuehlewind  Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                  PLUS Spec                     March 2017


      received value and the configured timeout for the flow's present
      state into this field.  The encoding of this field is TBD.

   o  Rate limit accumulator: This signal allows exposure of rate
      limiting along the path.  It is initialized to a maximum ("no
      information") value by the sender.  A PLUS-aware forwarding device
      on path receiving this value fills in the minimum of the received
      value and the rate limit to which this flow is subject into this
      field.  The encoding of this field is TBD.

   o  MTU accumulator: This signal allows measurement of MTU information
      from PLUS-aware devices.  The sender sets the initial value to the
      sender's MTU.  A PLUS-aware forwarding device on path receiving
      this value fills in the minimum of the received value and the MTU
      of the next hop, in bytes into this field.  The information, when
      fed back to the sender, can be used as a hint for a running
      PLPMTUD [RFC4821] process.

   o  Trace accumulator.  This signal allows exposure of a trace of
      PLUS-aware devices on path, similar to the Path Changes mechanism
      in section 4.3 of [IPIM].  The sender initializes the value to a
      value chosen randomly for the flow; all packets in the flow using
      path trace accumulator must use the same initial value.  A PLUS-
      aware forwarding device on path receiving this value fills in the
      result of XORing the received value with a randomly chosen device
      identifier, which it must use for all path trace accumulator
      signals it participates in.  Packets traversing the same set of
      PLUS-aware forwarding devices in the same flow therefore arrive at
      the receiver with the same accumulated value, and changes to the
      set of devices on path can be detected by the receiver.

4.  Implementation and Deployment Considerations

   Here we discuss considerations for the implementation of overlying
   transports on PLUS, and their deployment in the Internet

4.1.  Interface to Overlying Transport

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Since the overlying transport is responsible for
   providing the cryptographic context used for integrity protection and
   feedback, and may be responsible for feedback as well, the
   "northbound" interface needs to be concretely specified in a future
   revision of this document.]

Internet-Draft                  PLUS Spec                     March 2017


4.2.  Discovery

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Discovery is currently explicitly out of band.
   Should there be a way for a PLUS-aware overlying transport to
   discover whether its peer wants to use a PLUS- or non-PLUS variant of
   the transport?  This is a specific case of the generalized multi-
   transport discovery and negotiation problem, so whatever happens here
   should be interoperable with deployed/deployable approaches.]

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.  Path communication field
   types and PLUS magic numbers may be moved to a Standards Action
   registry in a future revision.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the PLUS Basic and Extended Headers, and the
   protocol they support.  This protocol can be used to expose
   information to devices along the path to replace the analysis of
   transport- and application-layer headers when those headers are
   encrypted.  Care must be taken in the exposure of such information to
   ensure no irrelevant application and/or user confidential information
   is exposed.

   PLUS itself contains some security-relevant features.  In concert
   with an encrypted overlying transport, the PLUS Basic and Extended
   Headers are integrity-protected to prevent manipulation on-path of
   any value except Path to Receiver values; this integrity protection
   prevents path elements from injecting values without explicit sender
   involvement, or from being stripped from the PLUS Extended Header.

   The CAT and PSE described in Section 2 taken together, provide
   entropy to prevent on-path devices from being driven into incorrect
   states by off-path attackers.  Bidirectional stop signaling as in
   Section 2.3.2 requires an on-path attacker of a given middlebox to
   forge traffic on both of the middlebox's interfaces to drive a
   middlebox to inappropriately drop state for a flow.
