        Methods for Detection and Mitigation of BGP Route Leaks
          draft-sriram-idr-route-leak-detection-mitigation-00

Abstract

   In [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition], the authors have
   provided a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerated
   several types of route leaks.  In this document, we first examine
   which of those route-leak types are detected and mitigated by the
   existing origin validation [RFC 6811] and BGPSEC path validation [I-
   D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].  Where the current BGPSEC protocol
   doesn't offer a solution, this document suggests an enhancement that
   would extend the route-leak detection and mitigation capability of
   BGPSEC.  The solution can be implemented in BGP without necessarily
   tying it to BGPSEC.  Incorporating the solution in BGPSEC is one way
   of implementing it in a secure way.  We do not claim to have provided
   a solution for all possible types of route leaks, but the solution
   covers several, especially considering some significant route-leak
   attacks or occurrences that have been observed in recent years.  The
   document also includes a stopgap method for detection and mitigation
   of route leaks for the phase when BGPSEC (path validation) is not yet
   deployed but only origin validation is deployed.

1.  Introduction

   In [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition], the authors have
   provided a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerated
   several types of route leaks.  In this document, we first examine
   which of those route-leak types are detected and mitigated by the
   existing Origin Validation (OV) [RFC6811] and BGPSEC path validation
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].  For the rest of this document, we
   use the term BGPSEC as synonymous with path validation.  The BGPSEC

   protocol provides cryptographic protection for some aspects of BGP
   update messages.  OV and BGPSEC together offer mechanisms to protect
   against mis-originations and hijacks of IP prefixes as well as man-
   in-the-middle (MITM) AS path modifications.  Route leaks (see
   [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition] and references cited at
   the back) are another type of vulnerability in the global BGP routing
   system against which BGPSEC so far offers only partial protection.

   For the types of route leaks enumerated in
   [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition], where the current
   BGPSEC protocol doesn't offer a solution, this document suggests an
   enhancement that would extend the detection and mitigation capability
   of BGPSEC.  The solution can be implemented in BGP without
   necessarily tying it to BGPSEC.  Incorporating the solution in BGPSEC
   is one way of implementing it in a secure way.  We do not claim to
   provide a solution for all possible types of route leaks, but the
   solution covers several relevant types, especially considering some
   significant route-leak occurrences that have been observed frequently
   in recent years.  The document also includes (in Section 3) a stopgap
   method for detection and mitigation of route leaks for the phase when
   BGPSEC (path validation) is not yet deployed but only origin
   validation is deployed.

2.  Mechanisms for Detection and Mitigation of Route Leaks

   Referring to the enumeration of route leaks discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition], Table 1 summarizes the
   route-leak detection capability offered by OV and BGPSEC for
   different types of route leaks.  (Note: Route filtering is not
   considered here in this table.  Please see Section 3.)

   A detailed explanation of the contents of Table 1 is as follows.  It
   is readily observed that route leaks of Types 1, 5, 6, and 7 are not
   detected by OV or even by BGPSEC.  Type 2 route leak involves
   changing a prefix to a subprefix (i.e. more specific); such a
   modified update will fail BGPSEC checks.  Clearly, Type 3 route leak
   involves hijacking and hence can be detected by OV.  In the case of
   Type 3 route leak, there would be no existing ROAs to validate a re-
   originated prefix or subprefix, and hence the update will be
   considered Invalid by OV.

               Validation and Current BGPSEC Path Validation

   In the case of Type 4 leaks involving internal prefixes that are not
   meant to be routed in the Internet, they are likely to be detected by
   OV.  That is because such prefixes might either have no covering ROA
   or have a ROA-AS0 to always filter them.  In the case of Type 4 leaks
   that are due to accidental deaggregation, they may be detected due to
   violation of ROA maxLength.  BGPSEC does not catch Type 4.  However,
   route leaks of Type 4 are least problematic due to the following
   reasons.  In the case of accidental deaggregation, the offending AS

   is itself the legitimate destination of the leaked more-specific
   prefixes.  Hence, in most cases of this type, the data traffic is
   neither misrouted not denied service.  Also, leaked announcements of
   Type 4 are short-lived and typically withdrawn quickly following the
   announcements.  Further, the MaxPrefix limit may kick in in some
   receiving routers and that helps limit the propagation of sometimes
   large number of leaked routes of Type 4.

   From the above, it is evident that in our proposed solution method,
   we need to focus primarily on route leaks of Types 1, 5, 6, and 7.
   In Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, we describe a simple addition to
   BGPSEC that facilitates cryptographically-enabled detection of route
   leaks of Types 1 and 7.  Then in Section 2.3, we will explain how the
   same method as described in Section 2.1 can be utilized between ISPs
   (or ASes) to detect and mitigate route leaks of Types 5 and 6.

2.1.  Route Leak Protection (RLP) Field Encoding by Sending Router

   The key principle is that, in the event of a route leak, a receiving
   router in a provider AS (e.g. referring to Figure 1, ISP2 (AS3)
   router) should be able to detect from the prefix-update that its
   customer AS (e.g.  AS1 in Figure 1) SHOULD NOT have forwarded the
   update (towards the provider AS).  This means that at least one of
   the ASes in the AS path of the update has indicated that it sent the
   update to its customer or peer AS, but forbade any subsequent 'Up'
   forwarding (i.e. from a customer AS to its provider AS).  For this
   purpose, a Route Leak Protection (RLP) field to be set by a sending
   router is proposed to be used for each AS hop.

        Figure 1: Illustration of the basic notion of a route leak.

   For the purpose of route leak detection and mitigation proposed in
   this document, the RLP field value SHOULD be set to one of two values
   as follows:

   o  00: This is the default value (i.e. "nothing specified"),

   o  01: This is the 'Do not Propagate Up' indication; sender
      indicating that the prefix-update SHOULD NOT be forwarded 'Up'
      towards a provider AS.

   There are two different scenarios when a sending AS SHOULD set the
   '01' indication in a prefix-update: (1) when sending the prefix-
   update to a customer AS, and (2) to let a peer AS know not to forward
   the prefix-update 'Up' towards a provide AS.  In essence, in both
   scenarios, the intent of '01' indication is that any receiving AS
   along the subsequent AS path SHOULD NOT forward the prefix-update
   'Up' towards its (receiving AS's) provider AS.

   One may argue for an RLP field value (e.g. '10') to be used to
   specify 'Up' (i.e. towards provider AS) directionality.  But in the
   interest of keeping the methodology simple, the choice of two RLP
   field values as defined above (00 - default, and 01 - 'Do not
   Propagate Up') is all that is needed.  This two-state specification
   in the RLP field can be shown to work for detection and mitigation of
   route leaks of Types 1 and 7 readily (and also Types 5 and 6; see
   Section 2.3), which are the focus here.  (Please see Section 4 for
   further discussion about the downside using 'Up' indication.)

Internet-Draft     Route Leak Detection and Mitigation        March 2015


   In general, the proposed RLP encoding can be carried in BGP-4
   [RFC4271] updates in any possible way, e.g., in a transitive
   community attribute.  We consider BGPSEC as an example, where the RLP
   encoding can be accommodated in the existing Flags field and thereby
   secured using the existing BGPSEC path signatures.  The Flags field
   is part of the Secure_Path Segment in BPGSEC updates
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].  It is one octet long, and one Flags
   field is available for each AS hop, and currently only the first bit
   is used in BGPSEC.  So there are 7 bits that are currently unused in
   the Flags field.  Two (or more if needed) of these bits can be
   designated for the RLP field.  Since the BGPSEC protocol
   specification requires a sending AS to include the Flags field in the
   data that are signed over, the RLP field for each hop (assuming it
   would be part of the Flags field) will be protected under the sending
   AS's signature.

2.2.  Recommended Actions at a Receiving Router

   We provide here an example set of receiver actions that work to
   detect and mitigate route leaks of Types 1 and 7 (in particular).
   This example algorithm serves as a proof of concept.  However, other
   receiver algorithms or procedures can be designed (based on the same
   sender specification as in Section 2.1) and may perform with greater
   efficacy, and are by no means excluded.

   A recommended receiver algorithm for detecting a route leak is as
   follows:

   A receiving BGPSEC router SHOULD mark an update as a Route-Leak if
   ALL of the following conditions hold true:

   1.  The update is received from a customer AS.

   2.  It is Valid in accordance with the BGPSEC protocol.

   3.  The update has the RLP field set to '01' (i.e.  'Do not Propagate
       Up') indication for one or more hops (excluding the most recent)
       in the AS path.

   The reason for stating "excluding the most recent" in the above
   algorithm is as follows.  The provider AS already knows that most
   recent hop in the update is from its customer AS to itself, and hence
   it does not need to rely on the RLP field value set by the customer
   for detection of route leaks.  (See further discussion in
   Section 4.1.)

   After applying the above detection algorithm, a receiving router may
   use any policy-based algorithm of its own choosing to mitigate any

Internet-Draft     Route Leak Detection and Mitigation        March 2015


   detected route leaks.  An example receiver algorithm for mitigating a
   route leak is as follows:

   o  If an update from a customer AS is marked as a Route-Leak, then
      the receiving router SHOULD prefer a Valid signed update from a
      peer or an upstream provider over the customer's update.

   The basic principle here is that the presence of '01' value in the
   RLP field corresponding to one or more AS hops in the AS path of an
   update coming from a customer AS informs a receiving router in a
   provider AS that a route leak is likely occurring.  The provider AS
   then overrides the "prefer customer route" policy, and instead
   prefers a route learned from a peer or another upstream provider over
   the customer's route.

   A receiving router expects the RLP field value for any hop in the AS
   path to be either 00 or 01.  However, if a different value (say, 10
   or 11) is found in the RLP field, then an error condition will get
   flagged, and any further action is TBD.

2.3.  Detection and Mitigation of Route Leaks of Type 5 and Type 6

   The sender and receiver actions described in Section 2.1 and
   Section 2.2 clearly help detect and mitigate route leaks of Types 1
   and 7.  With a slightly modified interpretation of the RLP encoding
   on the receiver side, they can be extended to detect lateral ISP-ISP-
   ISP route leaks (Type 5) as well as leaks of provider prefixes to
   peer (Type 6).  A sending ISP router would set RLP field value to
   '01' indication towards a peer AS or a customer AS, following the
   same sender principles as described in Section 2.1.

   A recommended receiver algorithm for an ISP to detect a route leak of
   either Type 5 or Type 6 is as follows:

   A receiving BGPSEC router SHOULD mark an update as a Route-Leak if
   ALL of the following conditions hold true:

   1.  The update is received from a lateral ISP peer or a customer AS.

   2.  It is Valid in accordance with the BGPSEC protocol.

   3.  The update has the RLP field set to '01' indication for one or
       more hops (excluding the most recent) in the AS path.

   In the above algorithm, the receiving AS interprets the '01'
   indication slightly strongly (i.e. stronger than in Section 2.2) to
   mean "the update SHOULD NOT have been propagated laterally to a peer
   ISP like me either".  The rationale here is based on the fact that



Sriram & Montgomery    Expires September 10, 2015               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     Route Leak Detection and Mitigation        March 2015


   settlement-free ISP peers accept only customer prefix-routes from
   each other.  The receiving AS applies the logic that if a preceding
   AS (excluding the most recent) set '01' indication, it means that the
   update was sent to a peer or a customer by the (preceding) AS, and
   the update should not be traversing a lateral peer-to-peer link
   subsequently.

   The receiver algorithm for mitigation is up to the discretion of the
   ISP.  It may simply prefer another unmarked (i.e. not route-leak)
   update from a different peer or an upstream ISP over a marked update.

3.  Stopgap Solution when Only Origin Validation is Deployed

   During a phase when BGPSEC path validation has not yet been deployed
   but only origin validation has been deployed, it would be good have a
   stopgap solution for route leaks.  The stopgap solution can be in the
   form of construction of a prefix filter list from ROAs.  A suggested
   procedure for constructing such a list comprises of the following
   steps:

   o  ISP makes a list of all the ASes (Cust_AS_List) that are in its
      customer cone (ISP's own AS is also included in the list).  (Some
      of the ASes in Cust_AS_List may be multi-homed to another ISP and
      that is OK.)

   o  ISP downloads from the RPKI repositories a complete list
      (Cust_ROA_List) of valid ROAs that contain any of the ASes in
      Cust_AS_List.

   o  ISP creates a list of all the prefixes (Cust_Prfx_List) that are
      contained in any of the ROAs in Cust_ROA_List.

   o  Cust_Prfx_List is the allowed list of prefixes that is permitted
      by the ISP's AS, and will be forwarded by the ISP to upstream
      ISPs, customers, and peers.

   o  Any prefix not in Cust_Prfx_List but announced by any of the ISP's
      customers is marked as a potential route leak.  Then the ISP's
      router SHOULD prefer a Valid (i.e. valid according to origin
      validation) and 'not marked' update from a peer or an upstream
      provider over the customer's marked update for that prefix.

   Special considerations with regard to the above procedure may be
   needed for DDoS mitigation service providers.  They typically
   originate or announce a DDoS victim's prefix to their own ISP on a
   short notice during a DDoS emergency.  Some provisions would need to
   be made for such cases, and they can be determined with the help of
   inputs from DDoS mitigation service providers.

4.  Design Rationale and Discussion

   In this section, we will try to provide design justifications for the
   methodology specified in Section 2, and also answer some anticipated
   questions.

4.1.  Downside of 'Up (Towards Provider AS)' Indication in the RLP Field

   As we have shown in Section 2, route leak detection and mitigation
   can be performed without the use of 'Up' (i.e. from customer AS to
   provider AS) indication in the RLP field.  The detection and
   mitigation action should primarily occur at a provider AS's router
   just as soon as a leaked update is received from a customer AS.  At
   that point, a provider AS can be fooled if it merely looks to see if
   an offending customer AS has set an 'Up' indication in the RLP field.
   This is so since a customer AS intent on leaking a route can
   deliberately set "Not Specified (00)" indication in order to misguide
   its provider AS.  So it seems better that a provider AS figures out
   that the update is moving in the 'Up' direction based only on its own
   (configuration-based) knowledge that the update is coming from one of
   its customer ASes.  An 'Up' indication (if it were allowed) can be
   also potentially misused.  For example, an AS in the middle can
   determine that a '01' (i.e.  'Do not Propagate Up') value already
   exists on one of the preceding AS hops in a received update's AS
   path.  Then, said AS in the middle can deliberately set its own RLP
   field to signal 'Up', in which case the update may be erroneously
   marked as a route leak by a subsequent AS if it concludes that there
   was a valley in the AS path of the update.  So there appears to be
   some possibility of misuse of 'Up' indication, and hence we proposed
   not including it in the RLP specification in Section 2.  However,
   other proposals, if any, that aim to beneficially use an 'Up'
   indication in the RLP field would be worth discussing.

4.2.  Possibility of Abuse of '01' (i.e.  'Do not Propagate Up')
      Indication in the RLP Field

   In reality, there appears to be no gain or incentive for an AS to
   falsely set its own RLP field to '01' (i.e.  'Do not Propagate Up')
   indication in an update that it originates or forwards.  The purpose
   of a deliberate route leak by an AS is to attract traffic towards
   itself, but if the AS were to falsely set its own RLP field to '01'
   value, it would be effectively repelling some or all traffic away
   from itself for the prefix in question (see receiver algorithms in
   Section 2.2 and Section 2.3).

5.  Summary

   It should be emphasized once again that the proposed route-leak
   detection method using the RLP encoding is not intended to cover all
   forms of route leaks.  However, we feel that the solution covers
   several important types of route leaks, especially considering some
   significant route-leak attacks or occurrences that have been
   frequently observed in recent years.  The solution can be implemented
   in BGP without necessarily tying it to BGPSEC.  Carrying the proposed
   RLP encoding in a transitive community attribute in BGP is another
   way, but in order to prevent abuse, the community attribute would
   require cryptographic protection.  Incorporating the RLP encoding in
   the BGPSEC Flags field is one way of implementing it securely using
   an already existing protection mechanism provided in BGPSEC path
   signatures.

6.  Security Considerations

   The proposed Route Leak Protection (RLP) field requires cryptographic
   protection.  Since it is proposed that the RLP field be included in
   the Flags field in the Secure_Path Segment in BPGSEC updates, the
   cryptographic security mechanisms in BGPSEC are expected to also
   apply to the RLP field.  The reader is therefore directed to the
   security considerations provided in [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].

7.  IANA Considerations

   No updates to the registries are suggested by this document.
