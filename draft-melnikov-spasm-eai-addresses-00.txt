1.  Introduction

   [RFC5280] defines rfc822Name subjectAltName choice for representing
   [RFC5322] email addresses.  This form is restricted to a subset of
   US-ASCII characters and thus can't be used to represent
   Internationalized Email addresses [RFC6531].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The formal syntax use the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]
   notation.

3.  Name Definitions

   This section defines the eaiName name as a form of otherName from the
   GeneralName structure in SubjectAltName defined in [RFC5280].

   id-on-eaiAddr OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-on XXX }

   eaiName ::= UTF8String (SIZE (1..MAX))

   When the subjectAltName extension contains an Internationalized Email
   address, the address MUST be stored in the eaiName name form of
   otherName.  The format of an eaiName is a <eaiMailbox> as defined
   below.  A eaiMailbox has the form "uLocal-part@uDomain".  Note that a
   eaiMailbox has no phrase (such as a common name) before it, has no
   comment (text surrounded in parentheses) after it, and is not
   surrounded by "<" and ">".

   eaiMailbox = uLocal-part "@" uDomain

   uLocal-part and uDomain are defined in [RFC6531].  [[CREF1: Alexey:
   uLocal-part and uDomain are no longer in RFC 6531, so we need to
   write explicit rules]]

4.  Matching of Internationalized Email Addresses in X.509 certificates

   The <uLocal-part> part of an Internationalized email address is in
   UTF-8 and need to be compared octet for octet.

   The <uDomain> can contain either IDN domain or an ASCII Compatible
   Encoding (ACE) format.  When comparing two <uDomain>s both MUST be
   converted to the ACE form as described in section 7.2 of [RFC5280].

5.  IANA Considerations

   [[CREF2: Just need a new OID.]]

6.  Security Considerations

   [[CREF3: TBD]]
