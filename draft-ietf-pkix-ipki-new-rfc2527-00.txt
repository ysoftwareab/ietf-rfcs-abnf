certificate policies or certification practice statements for 
participants within public key infrastructures, such as 
certification authorities, policy authorities, and communities of 
interest that wish to rely on certificates.  In particular, the 
framework provides a comprehensive list of topics that potentially 
(at the writer's discretion) need to be covered in a certificate 
policy or a certification practice statement.  This document is 
being submitted to the RFC Editor with a request for publication as 
an Informational RFC.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1  BACKGROUND

In general, a public-key certificate (hereinafter "certificate") 
binds a public key held by an entity (such as person, organization, 
account, device, or site) to a set of information that identifies 
the entity associated with use of the corresponding private key.  In 
most cases involving identity certificates, this entity is known as 
the "subject" or "subscriber" of the certificate.  Two exceptions, 
however, include devices (in which the subscriber is usually the 
individual or organization controlling the device) and anonymous 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 3]

certificates (in which the identity of the individual or 
organization is not available from the certificate itself).  
Other types of certificates bind public keys to attributes of an 
entity other than the entity's identity, such as a role, a title, or 
creditworthiness information.  

A certificate is used by a "certificate user" or "relying party" 
that needs to use, and rely upon the accuracy of, the binding 
between the subject public key distributed via that certificate and 
the identity and/or other attributes of the subject contained in 
that certificate.  A relying party is frequently an entity that 
verifies a digital signature from the certificate's subject where 
the digital signature is associated with an email, web form, 
electronic document, or other data.  Other examples of relying 
parties can include a sender of encrypted email to the subscriber, a 
user of a web browser relying on a server certificate during a 
secure sockets layer (SSL) session, and an entity operating a server 
that controls access to online information using client certificates 
as an access control mechanism.  In summary, a relying party is an 
entity that uses a public key in a certificate (for signature 
verification and/or encryption).  The degree to which a relying 
party can trust the binding embodied in a certificate depends on 
several factors.  These factors can include the practices followed 
by the certification authority (CA) in authenticating the subject; 
the CA's operating policy, procedures, and security controls; the 
scope of the subscriber's responsibilities (for example, in 
protecting the private key); and the stated responsibilities and 
liability terms and conditions of the CA (for example, warranties, 
disclaimers of warranties, and limitations of liability).
 
A Version 3 X.509 certificate may contain a field declaring that one 
or more specific certificate policies apply to that certificate 
[ISO1].  According to X.509, a certificate policy (CP) is "a named 
set of rules that indicates the applicability of a certificate to a 
particular community and/or class of applications with common 
security requirements."  A CP may be used by a relying party to help 
in deciding whether a certificate, and the binding therein, are 
sufficiently trustworthy and otherwise appropriate for a particular 
application.  The CP concept is an outgrowth of the policy statement 
concept developed for Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail [PEM1] and 
expanded upon in [BAU1].
 
A more detailed description of the practices followed by a CA in 
issuing and otherwise managing certificates may be contained in a 
certification practice statement (CPS) published by or referenced by 
the CA.  According to the American Bar Association Information 
Security Committee's Digital Signature Guidelines (hereinafter 
"DSG")(1) and the Information Security Committee's PKI Assessment 
Guidelines (hereinafter "PAG")(2), "a CPS is a statement of the 
practices which a certification authority employs in issuing 
certificates." [ABA1, ABA2]

The terms contained in a CP or CPS may or may not be binding upon a 
PKI's participants as a contract.  A CP or CPS may itself purport to 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 4]

be a contract.  More commonly, however, an agreement may incorporate 
a CP or CPS by reference and therefore bind the parties of the 
agreement to some or all of its terms.  For example, some PKIs may 
utilize a CP or (more commonly) a CPS that is incorporated by 
reference in the agreement between a subscriber and a CA or RA 
(called a "subscriber agreement") or the agreement between a relying 
party and a CA (called a "relying party agreement" or "RPA").  In 
other cases, however, a CP or CPS has no contractual significance at 
all.  A PKI may intend these CPs and CPSs to be strictly 
informational or disclosure documents.

This RFC supercedes RFC 2527 [CPF].

1.2  PURPOSE

The purpose of this document is twofold.  First, the document aims 
to explain the concepts of a CP and a CPS, describe the differences 
between these two concepts, and describe their relationship to 
subscriber and relying party agreements.  Second, this document aims 
to present a framework to assist the writers and users of 
certificate policies or CPSs in drafting and understanding these 
documents.  In particular, the framework identifies the elements 
that may need to be considered in formulating a CP or a CPS.  The 
purpose is not to define particular certificate policies or CPSs, 
per se.  Moreover, this document does not aim to provide 
recommendations as to particular requirements or practices that 
should be contained within CPs or CPSs.  (Such recommendations, 
however, appear in [ABA2].) 

1.3  SCOPE

The scope of this document is limited to discussion of the topics 
that can be covered in a CP (as defined in X.509) or CPS (as defined 
in the DSG and PAG).  In particular, this document describes the 
types of information that should be considered for inclusion in a CP 
or a CPS.  While the framework as presented generally assumes use of 
the X.509 version 3 certificate format for the purpose of providing 
assurances of identity, it is not intended that the material be 
restricted to use of that certificate format or identity 
certificates.  Rather, it is intended that this framework be 
adaptable to other certificate formats and to certificates providing 
assurances other than identity that may come into use.

The scope does not extend to defining security policies generally 
(such as organization security policy, system security policy, or 
data labeling policy).  Further, this document does not define a 
specific CP or CPS.  Moreover, in presenting a framework, this 
document should be viewed and used as a flexible tool presenting 
topics that should be considered of particular relevance to CPs or 
CPSs, and not as a rigid formula for producing CPs or CPSs.
 
This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the general 
concepts of digital signatures, certificates, and public-key 
infrastructure (PKI), as used in X.509, the DSG, and the PAG.

2.  DEFINITIONS

This document makes use of the following defined terms:

Activation data - Data values, other than keys, that are required to 
operate cryptographic modules and that need to be protected (e.g., a 
PIN, a passphrase, or a manually-held key share).

Authentication - The process of establishing that individuals, 
organizations, or things are who or what they claim to be.  In the 
context of a PKI, authentication can be the process of establishing 
that that an individual or organization applying for or seeking 
access to something under a certain name is, in fact, the proper 
individual or organization.  This process corresponds to the second 
process involved with identification, as shown in the definition of 
"identification" below.  Authentication can also refer to a security 
service that provides assurances that individuals, organizations, or 
things are who or what they claim to be or that a message or other 
data originated from a specific individual, organization, or device.  
Thus, it is said that a digital signature of a message authenticates 
the message's sender.
 
CA-certificate - A certificate for one CA's public key issued by 
another CA.

Certificate policy (CP) - A named set of rules that indicates the 
applicability of a certificate to a particular community and/or 
class of application with common security requirements.  For 
example, a particular CP might indicate applicability of a type of 
certificate to the authentication of parties engaging in business-
to-business transactions for the trading of goods or services within 
a given price range.  
 
Certification path - An ordered sequence of certificates that, 
together with the public key of the initial object in the path, can 
be processed to obtain that of the final object in the path. 
 
Certification Practice Statement (CPS) - A statement of the 
practices that a certification authority employs in issuing 
certificates.

CPS Summary (or CPS Abstract) - A subset of the provisions of a 
complete CPS that is made public by a CA.

Identification - The process of establishing the identity of an 
individual or organization, i.e., to show that an individual or 
organization is a specific individual or organization.  In the 
context of a PKI, identification refers to two processes:  (1) 
establishing that a given name of an individual or organization 
corresponds to a real-world identity of an individual or 
organization, and (2) establishing that an individual or 
organization applying for or seeking access to something under that 
name is, in fact, the named individual or organization.  A person 
seeking identification may be a certificate applicant, an applicant 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 6]

for employment in a trusted position within a PKI participant, or 
a person seeking access to a network or software application, such 
as a CA administrator seeking access to CA systems.

Issuing certification authority (issuing CA) - In the context of a 
particular certificate, the issuing CA is the CA that issued the 
certificate (see also Subject certification authority).

Participant - An individual or organization that plays a role within 
a given PKI as a subscriber, relying party, CA, RA, certificate 
manufacturing authority, repository service provider, or similar 
entity.

PKI Disclosure Statement (PDS) - An instrument that supplements a CP 
or CPS by disclosing critical information about the policies and 
practices of a CA/PKI.  A PDS is a vehicle for disclosing and 
emphasizing information normally covered in detail by associated CP 
and/or CPS documents.  Consequently, a PDS is not intended to 
replace a CP or CPS.
 
Policy qualifier - Policy-dependent information that may accompany a 
CP identifier in an X.509 certificate.  Such information can include 
a pointer to the URL of the applicable CPS or relying party 
agreement.  It may also include text (or number causing the 
appearance of text) that contains terms of the use of the 
certificate or other legal information.

Registration authority (RA) - An entity that is responsible for one 
or more of the following functions:  the identification and 
authentication of certificate applicants, the approval or rejection 
of certificate applications, initiating certificate revocations or 
suspensions under certain circumstances, processing subscriber 
requests to revoke or suspend their certificates, and approving or 
rejecting requests by subscribers to renew or re-key their 
certificates.  RAs, however, do not sign or issue certificates 
(i.e., an RA is delegated certain tasks on behalf of a CA).  [Note:  
The term Local Registration Authority (LRA) is sometimes used in 
other documents for the same concept.]

Relying party - A recipient of a certificate who acts in reliance on 
that certificate and/or any digital signatures verified using that 
certificate.  In this document, the terms "certificate user" and 
"relying party" are used interchangeably.

Relying party agreement (RPA) - An agreement between a certification 
authority and relying party that typically establishes the rights 
and responsibilities between those parties regarding the 
verification of digital signatures or other uses of certificates.
 
Set of provisions - A collection of practice and/or policy 
statements, spanning a range of standard topics, for use in 
expressing a CP or CPS employing the approach described in this 
framework.
 
Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 7]

Subject certification authority (subject CA) - In the context of 
a particular CA-certificate, the subject CA is the CA whose public 
key is certified in the certificate (see also Issuing certification 
authority).

Subscriber - A subject of a certificate who is issued a certificate. 

Subscriber Agreement - An agreement between a CA and a subscriber 
that establishes the right and responsibilities of the parties 
regarding the issuance and management of certificates.

Validation - The process of identification of certificate 
applicants.  "Validation" is a subset of "identification" and refers 
to identification in the context of establishing the identity of 
certificate applicants. 

3.  CONCEPTS

This section explains the concepts of CP and CPS, and describes 
their relationship with other PKI documents, such as subscriber 
agreements and relying party agreements.  Other related concepts are 
also described.  Some of the material covered in this section and in 
some other sections is specific to certificate policies extensions 
as defined X.509 version 3.  Except for those sections, this 
framework is intended to be adaptable to other certificate formats 
that may come into use.

3.1  CERTIFICATE POLICY

When a certification authority issues a certificate, it is providing 
a statement to a certificate user (i.e., a relying party) that a 
particular public key is bound to the identity and/or other 
attributes of a particular entity (the certificate subject, which is 
usually also the subscriber).  The extent to which the relying party 
should rely on that statement by the CA, however, needs to be 
assessed by the relying party or entity controlling or coordinating 
the way relying parties or relying party applications use 
certificates.  Different certificates are issued following different 
practices and procedures, and may be suitable for different 
applications and/or purposes.
 
The X.509 standard defines a CP as "a named set of rules that 
indicates the applicability of a certificate to a particular 
community and/or class of application with common security 
requirements" [ISO1].  An X.509 Version 3 certificate may identify a 
specific applicable CP, which may be used by a relying party to 
decide whether or not to trust a certificate for a particular 
purpose.

CPs typically fall into two major categories.  First, some CPs 
"indicate the applicability of a certificate to a particular 
community" [ISO1].  These CPs set forth requirements for 
certificates within a particular community.  For instance, a CP may 
focus on the needs of a geographical community, such as the ETSI 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 8]

policy requirements for CAs issuing qualified certificates [ETS].  
Also, a CP of this kind may focus on the needs of a specific 
vertical-market community, such as financial services [IDT].

The second category of typical CPs "indicate the applicability of a 
certificate to a . . . class of application with common security 
requirements."  These CPs identify a set of applications or uses for 
certificates and say that these applications or uses require a 
certain level of security.  They then set forth PKI requirements 
that are appropriate for these applications or uses.  A CP within 
this category often makes sets requirements appropriate for a 
certain "level of assurance" provided by certificates, relative to 
certificates issued pursuant to related CPs.  These levels of 
assurance may correspond to "classes" or "types" of certificates.

For instance, the Government of Canada PKI Policy Management 
Authority (GOC PMA) has established eight certificate policies in a 
single document [GOC], four policies for certificates used for 
digital signatures and four policies for certificates used for 
confidentiality encryption.  For each of these applications, the 
document establishes four levels of assurances:  rudimentary, basic, 
medium, and high.  The GOC PMA described certain types of digital 
signature and confidentiality uses in the document, each with a 
certain set of security requirements, and grouped them into eight 
categories.  The GOC PMA then established PKI requirements for each 
of these categories, thereby creating eight types of certificates, 
each providing rudimentary, basic, medium, or high levels of 
assurance.  The progression from rudimentary to high levels 
corresponds to increasing security requirements and corresponding 
increasing levels of assurance.

A CP, which needs to be recognized by both the issuer and user of a 
certificate, is represented in a certificate by a unique number 
called an "Object Identifier" (OID).  That OID, or at least an "arc" 
representing the beginning of the numerical sequence of an OID and 
assigned to a particular organization, can be registered.  The 
registration process follows the procedures specified in ISO/IEC and 
ITU standards.  The party that registers the OID or arc also can 
publish the text of the CP, for examination by relying parties.  Any 
one certificate will typically declare a single CP or, possibly, be 
issued consistent with a small number of different policies.  Such 
declaration appears in the Certificate Policies extension of a X.509 
Version 3 certificate.  When a CA places multiple CPs within a 
certificate's Certificate Policies extension, the CA is asserting 
that the certificate is appropriate for use in accordance with any 
of the listed CPs.

CPs also constitute a basis for an audit, accreditation, or another 
assessment of a CA.  Each CA can be assessed against one or more 
certificate policies or CPSs that it is recognized as implementing.  
When one CA issues a CA-certificate for another CA, the issuing CA 
must assess the set of certificate policies for which it trusts the 
subject CA (such assessment may be based upon an assessment with 
respect to the certificate policies involved).  The assessed set of 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 9]

certificate policies is then indicated by the issuing CA in the 
CA-certificate.  The  X.509 certification path processing logic 
employs these CP indications in its well-defined trust model.

3.2  CERTIFICATE POLICY EXAMPLES

For example purposes, suppose that the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) undertakes to define some certificate policies 
for use throughout the airline industry, in a PKI operated by IATA 
in combination with PKIs operated by individual airlines.  Two CPs 
might be defined - the IATA General-Purpose CP, and the IATA 
Commercial-Grade CP.  

The IATA General-Purpose CP could be used by industry personnel for 
protecting routine information (e.g., casual electronic mail) and 
for authenticating connections from World Wide Web browsers to 
servers for general information retrieval purposes. The key pairs 
may be generated, stored, and managed using low-cost, software-based 
systems, such as commercial browsers.  Under this policy, a 
certificate may be automatically issued to anybody listed as an 
employee in the corporate directory of IATA or any member airline 
who submits a signed certificate request form to a network 
administrator in his or her organization.
 
The IATA Commercial-Grade CP could be used to protect financial 
transactions or binding contractual exchanges between airlines.  
Under this policy, IATA could require that certified key pairs be 
generated and stored in approved cryptographic hardware tokens.  
Certificates and tokens could be provided to airline employees with 
disbursement authority.  These authorized individuals might then be 
required to present themselves to the corporate security office, 
show a valid identification badge, and sign a subscriber agreement 
requiring them to protect the token and use it only for authorized 
purposes, as a condition of being issued a token and a certificate. 

3.3 X.509 CERTIFICATE FIELDS

The following extension fields in an X.509 certificate are used to 
support CPs:
 
* Certificate Policies extension;
* Policy Mappings extension; and
* Policy Constraints extension.

3.3.1 Certificate Policies Extension

A Certificate Policies field lists CPs that the certification 
authority declares are applicable.  Using the example of the IATA 
General-Purpose and Commercial-Grade policies defined in Section 
3.2, the certificates issued to regular airline employees would 
contain the object identifier for General-Purpose policy.  The 
certificates issued to the employees with disbursement authority 
would contain the object identifiers for both the General-Purpose 
policy and the Commercial-Grade policy.  The inclusion of both 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 10]

object identifiers in the certificates means that they would be 
appropriate for either the General-Purpose or Commercial-Grade 
policies.  The Certificate Policies field may also optionally convey 
qualifier values for each identified policy; the use of qualifiers 
is discussed in Section 3.4.

When processing a certification path, a CP that is acceptable to the 
relying party application must be present in every certificate in 
the path, i.e., in CA-certificates as well as end entity 
certificates.
 
If the Certificate Policies field is flagged critical, it serves the 
same purpose as described above but also has an additional role.  
Specifically, it indicates that the use of the certificate is 
restricted to one of the identified policies, i.e., the 
certification authority is declaring that the certificate must only 
be used in accordance with the provisions of at least one of the 
listed CPs.  This field is intended to protect the certification 
authority against claims for damages asserted by a relying party who 
has used the certificate for an inappropriate purpose or in an 
inappropriate manner, as stipulated in the applicable CP.
 
For example, the Internal Revenue Service might issue certificates 
to taxpayers for the purpose of protecting tax filings.  The 
Internal Revenue Service understands and can accommodate the risks 
of erroneously issuing a bad certificate, e.g., to an imposter.  
Suppose, however, that someone used an Internal Revenue Service tax-
filing certificate as the basis for encrypting multi-million-dollar-
value proprietary trade secrets, which subsequently fell into the 
wrong hands because of a cryptanalytic attack by an attacker who is 
able to decrypt the message.  The Internal Revenue Service may want 
to defend itself against claims for damages in such circumstances by 
pointing to the criticality of the Certificate Policies extension to 
show that the subscriber and relying party misused the certificate.  
The critical-flagged Certificate Policies extension is intended to 
mitigate the risk to the CA in such situations.  

3.3.2  Policy Mappings Extension

The Policy Mappings extension may only be used in CA-certificates.  
This field allows a certification authority to indicate that certain 
policies in its own domain can be considered equivalent to certain 
other policies in the subject certification authority's domain.
 
For example, suppose that for purposes of facilitating 
interoperability, the ACE Corporation establishes an agreement with 
the ABC Corporation to cross-certify the public keys of each others' 
certification authorities for the purposes of mutually securing 
their respective business-to-business exchanges.  Further, suppose 
that both companies have pre-existing financial transaction 
protection policies called ace-e-commerce and abc-e-commerce, 
respectively.  One can see that simply generating cross-certificates 
between the two domains will not provide the necessary 
interoperability, as the two companies' applications are configured 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 11]

with, and employee certificates are populated with, their 
respective certificate policies.  One possible solution is to 
reconfigure all of the financial applications to require either 
policy and to reissue all the certificates with both policies 
appearing in their Certificate Policies extensions.  Another 
solution, which may be easier to administer, uses the Policy Mapping 
field.  If this field is included in a cross-certificate for the ABC 
Corporation certification authority issued by the ACE Corporation 
certification authority, it can provide a statement that the ABC's 
financial transaction protection policy (i.e., abc-e-commerce) can 
be considered equivalent to that of the ACE Corporation (i.e., ace-
e-commerce).  With such a statement included in the cross-
certificate issued to ABC, relying party applications in the ACE 
domain requiring the presence of the object identifier for the ace-
e-commerce CP can also accept, process, and rely upon certificates 
issued within the ABC domain containing the object identifier for 
the abc-e-commerce CP.

3.3.3  Policy Constraints Extension

The Policy Constraints extension supports two optional features.  
The first is the ability for a certification authority to require 
that explicit CP indications be present in all subsequent 
certificates in a certification path.  Certificates at the start of 
a certification path may be considered by a relying party to be part 
of a trusted domain, i.e., certification authorities are trusted for 
all purposes so no particular CP is needed in the Certificate 
Policies extension.  Such certificates need not contain explicit 
indications of CP.  When a certification authority in the trusted 
domain, however, certifies outside the domain, it can activate the 
requirement that a specific CP's object identifier appear in 
subsequent certificates in the certification path.

The other optional feature in the Policy Constraints field is the 
ability for a certification authority to disable policy mapping by 
subsequent certification authorities in a certification path.  It 
may be prudent to disable policy mapping when certifying outside the 
domain.  This can assist in controlling risks due to transitive 
trust, e.g., a domain A trusts domain B, domain B trusts domain C, 
but domain A does not want to be forced to trust domain C.

3.3.4  Policy Qualifiers

The Certificate Policies extension field has a provision for 
conveying, along with each CP identifier, additional policy-
dependent information in a qualifier field.  The X.509 standard does 
not mandate the purpose for which this field is to be used, nor does 
it prescribe the syntax for this field.  Policy qualifier types can 
be registered by any organization.
 
The following policy qualifier types are defined in PKIX RFC 2459 
[PKI1]:
 
Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 12]

 (a) The CPS Pointer qualifier contains a pointer to a CPS, CPS 
Summary, RPA, or PDS published by the CA.  The pointer is in the 
form of a uniform resource identifier (URI).

(b) The User Notice qualifier contains a text string that is to be 
displayed to subscribers and relying parties prior to the use of the 
certificate.  The text string may be an IA5String or a BMPString - a 
subset of the ISO 100646-1 multiple octet coded character set.  A CA 
may invoke a procedure that requires that the relying party 
acknowledge that the applicable terms and conditions have been 
disclosed and/or accepted.

Policy qualifiers can be used to support the definition of generic, 
or parameterized, CPs.  Provided the base CP so provides, policy 
qualifier types can be defined to convey, on a per-certificate 
basis, additional specific policy details that fill in the generic 
definition.

3.4  CERTIFICATION PRACTICE STATEMENT

The term certification practice statement (CPS) is defined by the 
DSG and PAG as:  "A statement of the practices which a certification 
authority employs in issuing certificates." [ABA1, ABA2]  In the 
DSG, the ABA expands this definition with the following comments:

"A certification practice statement may take the form of a 
declaration by the certification authority of the details of its 
trustworthy system and the practices it employs in its operations 
and in support of issuance of a certificate . . . ."  This form of 
CPS is the most common type, and can vary in length and level of 
detail.

Some PKIs may not have the need to create a thorough and detailed 
statement of practices.  For example, the CA may itself be the 
relying party and would already be aware of the nature and 
trustworthiness of its services.  In other cases, a PKI may provide 
certificates providing only a very low level of assurances where the 
applications being secured may pose only marginal risks if 
compromised.  In these cases, a PKI may only want to write a 
subscriber agreement, relying party agreement, or an agreement 
combining subscriber and relying party terms, depending on the role 
of the different PKI participants.  In such a PKI, that agreement 
may serve as the only "statement of practices that a certification 
authority employs in issuing certificates."  Consequently, that 
agreement may also be considered a CPS and can be entitled or 
subtitled as such.

Likewise, since a detailed CPS may contain sensitive details of its 
system, a CA may elect not to publish its entire CPS.  It may 
instead opt to publish a CPS Summary (or CPS Abstract).  The CPS 
Summary would contain only those provisions from the CPS that the CA 
considers to be relevant to the participants in the PKI (such as the 
responsibilities of the parties or the stages of the certificate 
lifecycle).  A CPS Summary, however, would not contain those 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 13]

sensitive provisions of the full CPS that might provide an 
attacker with useful information about the CA's operations.  
Throughout this document, the use of "CPS" includes both a detailed 
CPS and a CPS Summary (unless otherwise specified).

CPSs do not automatically constitute contracts and do not 
automatically bind PKI participants as a contract would.  Where a 
document serves the dual purpose of being a subscriber or relying 
party agreement and CPS, the document is intended to be a contract 
and constitutes a binding contract to the extent that a subscriber 
or relying party agreement would ordinarily be considered as such.  
Most CPSs, however, do not serve such a dual purpose.  Therefore, in 
most cases, a CPS's terms have a binding effect as contract terms 
only if a separate document creates a contractual relationship 
between the parties and that document incorporates part or all of 
the CPS by reference.  Further, if a particular PKI employs a CPS 
Summary (as opposed to the entire CPS), the CPS Summary could be 
incorporated into any applicable subscriber or relying party 
agreement.

In the future, a court or applicable statutory or regulatory law may 
declare that a certificate itself is a document that is capable of 
creating a contractual relationship, to the extent its mechanisms 
designed for incorporation by reference (such as the Certificate 
Policies extension and its qualifiers) indicate that terms of its 
use appear in certain documents.  In the meantime, however, some 
subscriber agreements and relying party agreements may incorporate a 
CPS by reference and therefore make its terms binding on the parties 
to such agreements.

3.5  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CERTIFICATE POLICY AND CERTIFICATION 
PRACTICE STATEMENT

The CP and CPS address the same set of topics that are of interest 
to the relying party in terms of the degree to and purpose for which 
a public key certificate should be trusted.  Their primary 
difference is in the focus of their provisions.  A CP sets forth the 
requirements and standards imposed by the PKI with respect to the 
various topics.  In other words, the purpose of the CP is to 
establish what participants must do.  A CPS, by contrast, states how 
a CA and other participants in a given domain implement procedures 
and controls to meet the requirements stated in the CP.  In other 
words, the purpose of the CPS is to disclose how the participants 
perform their functions and implement controls.

An additional difference between a CP and CPS relates the scope of 
coverage of the two kinds of documents.  Since a CP is a statement 
of requirements, it best serves as the vehicle for communicating 
minimum operating guidelines that must be met by interoperating PKIs 
.  Thus, a CP generally applies to multiple CAs, multiple 
organizations, or multiple domains.  By contrast, a CPS applies only 
to a single CA or single organization and is not generally a vehicle 
to facilitate interoperation.

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 14]

A CA with a single CPS may support multiple CPs (used for 
different application purposes and/or by different relying party 
communities).  Also, multiple CAs, with non-identical CPSs, may 
support the same CP.

For example, the Federal Government might define a government-wide 
CP for handling confidential human resources information.  The CP 
will be a broad statement of the general requirements for 
participants within the Government's PKI, and an indication of the 
types of applications for which it is suitable for use.  Each 
department or agency wishing to operate a certification authority in 
this PKI may be required to write its own certification practice 
statement to support this CP by explaining how it meets the 
requirements of the CP.  At the same time, a department's or 
agency's CPS may support other certificate policies.

An additional difference between a CP and CPS concerns the level of 
detail of the provisions in each.  Although the level of detail may 
vary among CPSs, a CPS will generally be more detailed than a CP.  A 
CPS provides a detailed description of procedures and controls in 
place to meet the CP requirements, while a CP is more general.

The main differences between CPs and CPSs can therefore be 
summarized as follows: 

(a)  A PKI uses a CP to establish requirements that state what 
participants within it must do.  A single CA or organization can use 
a CPS to disclose how it meets the requirements of a CP or how it 
implements its practices and controls.

(b)  A CP facilitates interoperation through cross-certification, 
unilateral certification, or other means.  Therefore, it is intended 
to cover multiple CAs.  By contrast, a CPS is a statement of a 
single CA or organization.  Its purpose is not to facilitate 
interoperation (since doing so is the function of a CP).

(c)  A CPS is generally more detailed than a CP and specifies how 
the CA meets the requirements specified in the one or more CPs under 
which it issues certificates.

In addition to populating the certificate policies extension with 
the applicable CP object identifier, a certification authority may 
include, in certificates it issues, a reference to its certification 
practice statement.  A standard way to do this, using a CP 
qualifier, is described in Section 3.4.
 
3.6 RELATIONSHIP AMONG CPs, CPSs, AGREEMENTS, AND OTHER DOCUMENTS

CPs and CPSs play a central role in documenting the requirements and 
practices of a PKI.  Nonetheless, they are not the only documents 
relevant to a PKI.  For instance, subscriber agreements and relying 
party agreements play a critical role in allocating responsibilities 
to subscribers and relying parties relating to the use of 
certificates and key pairs, and establish the terms and conditions 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 15]

under which certificates are issued, managed, and used.  The term 
subscriber agreement is defined by the PAG as:  "An agreement 
between a CA and a subscriber that establishes the right and 
obligations of the parties regarding the issuance and management of 
certificates." [ABA2]  The PAG defines a relying party agreement as:  
"An agreement between a certification authority and relying party 
that typically establishes the rights and obligations between those 
parties regarding the verification of digital signatures or other 
uses of certificates." [ABA2]

As mentioned in Section 3.5, a subscriber agreement, relying party 
agreement, or an agreement that combines subscriber and relying 
party terms may also serve as a CPS.  In other PKIs, however, a 
subscriber or relying party agreement may incorporate some or all of 
the terms of a CP or CPS by reference.  Yet other PKIs may distill 
from a CP and/or CPS the terms that are applicable to a subscriber 
and place such terms in a self-contained subscriber agreement, 
without incorporating a CP or CPS by reference.  They may use the 
same method to distill relying party terms from a CP and/or CPS and 
place such terms in a self-contained relying party agreement.  
Creating such self-contained agreements has the advantage of 
creating documents that are easier for consumers to review.  In some 
cases, subscribers or relying parties may be deemed to be 
"consumers" under applicable law, who are subject to certain 
statutory or regulatory protections.  Under the legal systems of 
civil law countries, incorporating a CP or CPS by reference may not 
be effective to bind consumers to the terms of an incorporated CP or 
CPS.

CPs and CPSs may be incorporated by reference in other documents, 
including:
* Interoperability agreements (including agreements between CAs for 
cross-certification, unilateral certification, or other forms of 
interoperation),
* Vendor agreements (under which a PKI vendor agrees to meet 
standards set forth in a CP or CPS), or
* A PDS.
See [ABA2]

A PDS serves a similar function to a CPS Summary.  It is a 
relatively short document containing only a subset of critical 
details about a PKI or CA.  It may differ from a CPS Summary, 
however, in that its purpose is to act as a summary of information 
about the overall nature of the PKI, as opposed to simply a 
condensed form of the CPS.  Moreover, its purpose is to distill 
information about the PKI, as opposed to protecting security 
sensitive information contained in an unpublished CPS, although a 
PDS could also serve that function.

Just as writers may wish to refer to a CP or CPS or incorporate it 
by reference in an agreement or PDS, a CP or CPS may refer to other 
documents when establishing requirements or making disclosures.  For 
instance, a CP may set requirements for certificate content by 
referring to an external document setting forth a standard 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 16]

certificate profile.  Referencing external documents permits a CP 
or CPS to impose detailed requirements or make detailed disclosures 
without having to reprint lengthy provisions from other documents 
within the CP or CPS.  Moreover, referencing a document in a CP or 
CPS is another useful way of dividing disclosures between public 
information and security sensitive confidential information (in 
addition to or as an alternative to publishing a CPS Summary).  For 
example, a PKI may want to publish a CP or CPS, but maintain site 
construction parameters for CA high security zones as confidential 
information.  In that case, the CP or CPS could reference an 
external manual or document containing the detailed site 
construction parameters.

Documents that a PKI may wish to refer to in a CP or CPS include:
* A security policy,
* Training, operational, installation, and user manuals (which may 
contain operational requirements),
* Standards documents that apply to particular aspects of the PKI 
(such as standards specifying the level of protection offered by any 
hardware tokens used in the PKI or standards applicable to the site 
construction),
* Key management plans,
* Human resource guides and employment manuals (which may describe 
some aspects of personnel security practices), and
* E-mail policies (which may discuss subscriber and relying party 
responsibilities, as well as the implications of key management, if 
applicable).
See [ABA2]

3.7  SET OF PROVISIONS

A set of provisions is a collection of practice and/or policy 
statements, spanning a range of standard topics, for use in 
expressing a CP or CPS employing the approach described in this 
framework by covering the topic appearing in Section 5 below, which 
are described in detail in Section 4 below.  

A CP can be expressed as a single set of provisions.

A CPS can be expressed as a single set of provisions with each 
component addressing the requirements of one or more certificate 
policies, or, alternatively, as an organized collection of sets of 
provisions.  For example, a CPS could be expressed as a combination 
of the following:

(a)  a list of certificate policies supported by the CPS;

(b)  for each CP in (a), a set of provisions that contains 
statements responding to that CP by filling in details not 
stipulated in that policy or expressly left to the discretion of the 
CA (in its CPS) ; such statements serve to state how this particular 
CPS implements the requirements of the particular CP; or

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 17]

 (c)  a set of provisions that contains statements regarding the 
certification practices on the CA, regardless of CP.

The statements provided in (b) and (c) may augment or refine the 
stipulations of the applicable CP, but generally must not conflict 
with any of the stipulations of such CP.  In certain cases, however, 
a policy authority may permit exceptions to the requirements in a 
CP, because certain compensating controls of the CA are disclosed in 
its CPS that allow the CA to provide assurances that are equivalent 
to the assurances provided by CAs that are in full compliance with 
the CP.
  
This framework outlines the contents of a set of provisions, in 
terms of nine primary components, as follows:

1.  Introduction
2.  Publication and Repository
3. Identification and Authentication
4.  Certificate Life-Cycle Operational Requirements
5.  Facilities, Management, and Operational Controls
6.  Technical Security Controls
7.  Certificate, CRL, and OCSP Profile
8.  Compliance audit
9.  Other Business and Legal Matters

PKIs can use this simple framework of nine primary components to 
write a simple CP or CPS.  Moreover, a CA can use this same 
framework to write a subscriber agreement, relying party agreement, 
or agreement containing subscriber and relying party terms.  If a CA 
uses this simple framework to construct an agreement, it can use 
paragraph 1 as an introduction or recitals, it can set forth the 
responsibilities of the parties in paragraphs 2-8, and it can use 
paragraph 9 to cover the business and legal issues described in more 
detail in, and using the ordering of, Section 4.9 below (such as 
representations and warranties, disclaimers, and liability 
limitations).  The ordering of topics in this simple framework and 
the business and legal matters Section 4.9 is the same as (or 
similar to) the ordering of topics in a typical software or other 
technology agreement.  Therefore, a PKI can establish a set of core 
documents (with a CP, CPS, subscriber agreement, and relying party 
agreement) all having the same coverage and ordering of topics, 
thereby facilitating comparisons and mappings among these documents 
and among the corresponding documents of other PKIs.

This simple framework may also be useful for agreements other than 
subscriber agreements and relying party agreements.  For instance, a 
CA wishing to outsource certain services to an RA or certificate 
manufacturing authority (CMA) may find it useful to use this 
framework as a checklist to write a registration authority agreement 
or outsourcing agreement.  Similarly, two CAs may wish to use this 
simple framework for the purpose of drafting a cross-certification, 
unilateral certification, or other interoperability agreement.

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 18]

In short, the primary components of the simple framework 
(specified above) may meet the needs of drafters of short CPs, CPSs, 
subscriber agreements, and relying party agreements.  Nonetheless, 
this framework is extensible, and its coverage of the nine 
components is flexible enough to meet the needs of drafters of 
comprehensive CPs and CPSs.  Specifically, omponents appearing above 
can be further divided into subcomponents, and a subcomponent may 
comprise multiple elements.  Section 4 provides a more detailed 
description of the contents of the above components, and their 
subcomponents.  Drafters of CPs and CPSs are permitted to add 
additional levels of subcomponents below the subcomponents described 
in Section 4 for the purpose of meeting the needs of the drafter's 
particular PKI.

4.  CONTENTS OF A SET OF PROVISIONS

This section expands upon the contents of the simple framework of 
provisions, as introduced in Section 3.7.  The topics identified in 
this section are, consequently, candidate topics for inclusion in a 
detailed CP or CPS.

While many topics are identified, it is not necessary for a CP or a 
CPS to include a concrete statement for every such topic.  Rather, a 
particular CP or CPS may state "no stipulation" for a component, 
subcomponent, or element on which the particular CP or CPS imposes 
no requirements or makes no disclosure.  In this sense, the list of 
topics can be considered a checklist of topics for consideration by 
the CP or CPS writer.

It is recommended that each and every component and subcomponent be 
included in a CP or CPS, even if there is "no stipulation"; this 
will indicate to the reader that a conscious decision was made to 
include or exclude a provision concerning that topic.  This drafting 
style protects against inadvertent omission of a topic, while 
facilitating comparison of different certificate policies or CPSs, 
e.g., when making policy mapping decisions.

In a CP, it is possible to leave certain components, subcomponents, 
and/or elements unspecified, and to stipulate that the required 
information will be indicated in a policy qualifier, or the document 
to which a policy qualifier points.  Such CPs can be considered 
parameterized definitions.  The set of provisions should reference 
or define the required policy qualifier types and should specify any 
applicable default values.

4.1 INTRODUCTION
 
This component identifies and introduces the set of provisions, and 
indicates the types of entities and applications for which the 
document (either the CP or the CPS being written) is targeted.  

4.1.1  Overview

This subcomponent provides a general introduction to the document 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 19]

being written.  This subcomponent can also be used to provide a 
synopsis of the PKI to which the CP or CPS applies.  For example, 
it may set out different levels of assurance provided by 
certificates within the PKI.  Depending on the complexity and scope 
of the particular PKI, a diagrammatic representation of the PKI 
might be useful here.

4.1.2  Document Name and Identification

This subcomponent provides any applicable names or other 
identifiers, including ASN.1 object identifiers, for the document.  
An example of such a document name would be the US Federal 
Government Policy for Secure E-mail.

4.1.3  PKI Participants

This subcomponent describes the identity or types of entities that 
fill the roles of participants within a PKI, namely: 
 
* Certification authorities, i.e., the entities that issue 
certificates.  A CA is the issuing CA with respect to the 
certificates it issues and is the subject CA with respect to the CA 
certificate issued to it.  CAs may be organized in a hierarchy in 
which an organization's CA issues certificates to CAs operated by 
subordinate organizations, such as a branch, division, or department 
within a larger organization.
 
* Registration authorities, i.e., the entities that establishment 
enrollment procedures for end-user certificate applicants, perform 
identification and authentication of certificate applicants, 
initiate or pass along revocation requests for certificates, and 
approve applications for renewal or re-keying certificates on behalf 
of a CA.  Subordinate organizations within a larger organization can 
act as RAs for the CA serving the entire organization, but RAs may 
also be external to the CA.

* Subscribers.  Examples of subscribers who receive certificates 
from a CA include employees of an organization with its own CA, 
banking or brokerage customers, organizations hosting e-commerce 
sites, organizations participating in a business-to-business 
exchange, and members of the public receiving certificates from a CA 
issuing certificates to the public at large.

* Relying parties.  Examples of relying parties include employees of 
an organization having its own CA who receive digitally signed e-
mails from other employees, persons buying goods and services from 
e-commerce sites, organizations participating in a business-to-
business exchange who receive bids or orders from other 
participating organizations, and individuals and organizations doing 
business with subscribers who have received their certificates from 
a CA issuing certificates to the public.  Relying parties may or may 
not also be subscribers within a given PKI.

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 20]

* Other participants, such as certificate manufacturing 
authorities, providers of repository services, and other entities 
providing PKI-related services.

4.1.4  Certificate usage

This subcomponent contains:
 
* A list or the types of applications for which the issued 
certificates are suitable, such as electronic mail, retail 
transactions, contracts, and a travel order, and/or
 
* A list or the types of applications for which use of the issued 
certificates is prohibited.

In the case of a CP or CPS describing different levels of assurance, 
this subcomponent can describe applications or types of applications 
that are appropriate or inappropriate for the different levels of 
assurance.

4.1.5  Policy Administration

This subcomponent includes the name and mailing address of the 
organization that is responsible for the registration, maintenance, 
and interpretation of this CP or CPS.  It also includes the name, 
electronic mail address, telephone number, and fax number of a 
contact person.

Moreover, when a formal or informal policy authority is responsible 
for determining whether a CA should be allowed to operate within or 
interoperate with a PKI, it may wish to approve the CPS of the CA as 
being suitable for the policy authority's CP.  If so, this 
subcomponent includes the name, electronic mail address, telephone 
number, and fax number of the person in charge of making such a 
determination.  Finally, in this case, this subcomponent also 
includes the procedures by which this determination is made.

4.1.6  Definitions and acronyms
This subcomponent contains a list of definitions for defined terms 
used within the document, as well as a list of acronyms in the 
document and their meanings. 

4.2  PUBLICATION AND REPOSITORY RESPONSIBILITIES

This component contains any applicable provisions regarding:
* An identification of the entity or entities that operate 
repositories within the PKI, such as a CA, certificate manufacturing 
authority, or independent repository service provider;
 
*The responsibility of a PKI participant to publish information 
regarding its practices, certificates, and the current status of 
such certificates, which may include the responsibilities of making 
the CP or CPS publicly available using various mechanisms and of 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 21]

identifying components, subcomponents, and elements of such 
documents that exist but are not made publicly available, for 
instance, security controls, clearance procedures, or trade secret 
information due to their sensitivity;
 
* When information must be published and the frequency of 
publication; and
 
* Access control on published information objects including CPs, 
CPS, certificates, certificate status, and CRLs.

4.3  IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

This component describes the procedures used to authenticate the 
identity and/or other attributes of an end-user certificate 
applicant to a CA or RA prior to certificate issuance.  In addition, 
the component sets forth the procedures for authenticating the 
identity and the criteria for accepting applicants of entities 
seeking to become CAs, RAs, or other entities operating in or 
interoperating with a PKI.  It also describes how parties requesting 
re-key or revocation are authenticated.  This component also 
addresses naming practices, including the recognition of trademark 
rights in certain names.  

4.3.1  Naming

This subcomponent includes the following elements regarding naming 
and identification of the subscribers:
 
* Types of names assigned to the subject, such as X.500 
distinguished names; RFC-822 names; and X.400 names;
 
* Whether names have to be meaningful or not;(3)
 
* Whether subscribers can be anonymous or not and, if so, what names 
are assigned to anonymous subscribers;

* Rules for interpreting various name forms, such as the X.500 
standard and RFC-822;
 
* Whether names have to be unique; and
 
* Recognition, authentication, and role of trademarks.

4.3.2  Initial Identity Validation

This subcomponent contains the following elements for the 
identification and authentication procedures for the initial 
registration for each subject type (CA, RA, subscriber, or other 
participant):
 
* If and how the subject must prove possession of the companion 
private key for the public key being registered, for example, a 
digital signature in the certificate request message;(4)
 
Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 22]

* Identification and authentication requirements for 
organizational identity of subscriber or participant (CA; RA; 
subscriber (in the case of certificates issued to organizations or 
devices controlled by an organization), or other participant), for 
example, consulting the database of a service that identifies 
organizations or inspecting an organization's articles of 
incorporation;
 
* Identification and authentication requirements for an individual 
subscriber or a person acting on behalf of an organizational 
subscriber or participant (CA, RA, in the case of certificates 
issued to organizations or devices controlled by an organization, 
the subscriber, or other participant),(5) including:
 
* Type of documentation and/or number of identification credentials 
required;
* How a CA or RA authenticates the identity of the organization or 
individual based on the documentation or credentials provided;
* If the individual must present personally to the authenticating CA 
or RA;
* How an individual as an organizational person is authenticated, 
such as by reference to duly signed authorization documents or a 
corporate identification badge.
 
* List of subscriber information that is not verified (called "non-
verified subscriber information") during the initial registration;

* Validation of authority involves a determination of whether a 
person has specific rights, entitlements, or permissions, including 
the permission to act on behalf of an organization to obtain a 
certificate; and

* In the case of applications by a CA wishing to operate within, or 
interoperate with, a PKI, this subcomponent contains the criteria by 
which a PKI, CA, or policy authority determines whether or not the 
CA is suitable for such operations or interoperation.  Such 
interoperation may include cross-certification, unilateral 
certification, or other forms of interoperation.

4.3.3  Identification and Authentication for Re-key Requests

This subcomponent addresses the following elements for the 
identification and authentication procedures for re-key for each 
subject type (CA, RA, subscriber, and other participants):
 
* Identification and authentication requirements for routine re-key, 
such as a re-key request that contains the new key and is signed 
using the current valid key; and
 
* Identification and authentication requirements for re-key after 
certificate revocation.  One example is the use of the same process 
as the initial identity validation.
 
4.3.4  Identification and Authentication for Revocation Requests

This subcomponent describes the identification and authentication 
procedures for a revocation request by each subject type (CA, RA, 
subscriber, and other participant).  Examples include a revocation 
request digitally signed with the private key whose companion public 
key needs to be revoked and a digitally signed request by the RA.
  
4.4  CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

This component is used to specify requirements imposed upon issuing 
CA, subject CAs, RAs, subscribers, or other participants with 
respect to the life-cycle of certificate.  

Within each subcomponent, separate consideration may need to be 
given to subject CAs, RAs, subscribers, and other participants.

4.4.1  Certificate Application

This subcomponent is used to address the following requirements 
regarding subject certificate application:

* Who can submit a certificate application, such as a certificate 
subject or the RA; and
 
* Enrollment process used by subjects to submit certificate 
applications and responsibilities in connection with this process.  
An example of this process is where the subject generates the key 
pair and sends a certificate request to the RA.  The RA validates 
and signs the request and sends it to the CA.  A CA or RA may have 
the responsibility to establish an enrollment process in order to 
receive certificate applications.  Likewise, certificate applicants 
may have the responsibility to provide accurate information on their 
certificate applications.

4.4.2  Certificate Application Processing

This subcomponent is used to describe the procedure for processing 
certificate applications.  For example, the issuing CA and RA may 
perform identification and authentication procedures to validate the 
certificate application.  Following such steps, the CA or RA will 
either approve or reject the certificate application, perhaps upon 
the application of certain criteria.  Finally, this subcomponent 
sets for the time in which a CA and/or RA must act on and process a 
certificate application. 

4.4.3  Certificate Issuance

This subcomponent is used to describe the following certificate 
issuance related elements:
 
* Actions performed by the CA during the issuance of the 
certificate, for example a procedure whereby the CA validates the RA 
signature and RA authority and generates a certificate; and
 
Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 24]

* Notification mechanisms, if any, used by the CA to notify the 
subscriber of the issuance of the certificate; an example is a 
procedure under which the CA e-mails the certificate to the 
subscriber or the RA or e-mails information permitting the 
subscriber to download the certificate from a web site.

4.4.4  Certificate Acceptance

This subcomponent addresses the following:
 
* The conduct of an applicant that will be deemed to constitute 
acceptance of the certificate.  Such conduct may include affirmative 
steps to indicate acceptance, actions implying acceptance, or a 
failure to object to the certificate or its content.  For instance, 
acceptance may be deemed to occur if the CA does not receive any 
notice from the subscriber within a certain time period; a 
subscriber may send a signed message accepting the certificate; or a 
subscriber may send a signed message rejecting the certificate where 
the message includes the reason for rejection and identifies the 
fields in the certificate that are incorrect or incomplete.
 
* Publication of the certificate by the CA.  For example, the CA may 
post the certificate to an X.500 or LDAP repository.
 
* Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities.  
As an example, the CA may send the certificate to the RA.

4.4.5  Key Pair and Certificate Usage

This subcomponent is used to describe the responsibilities relating 
to the use of keys and certificates, including: 
 
* Subscriber responsibilities relating to use of the subscriber's 
private key and certificate.  For example, the subscriber may be 
required to use a private key and certificate only for appropriate 
applications as set forth in the CP and consistent with applicable 
certificate content (e.g., key usage field), use of a private key 
and certificate are subject to the terms of the subscriber 
agreement, the use of a private key is permitted only after the 
subscriber has accepted the corresponding certificate, or subscriber 
must discontinue use of the private key following expiration or 
revocation of the certificate. 
 
* Relying party responsibilities relating to the use of a 
subscriber's public key and certificate.  For instance, a relying 
party may be obligated to rely on certificates only for appropriate 
applications as set forth in the CP and consistent with applicable 
certificate content (e.g., key usage field), successfully perform 
public key operations as a condition of relying on a certificate, 
responsibility to check the status of certificate using one of the 
required or permitted mechanisms set forth in the CP/CPS (see 
Section 4.4.9 below), and assent to the terms of the applicable 
relying party agreement as a condition of relying on the 
certificate.

4.4.6  Certificate Renewal

This subcomponent is used to describe the following elements related 
to certificate renewal.  Certificate renewal means issuance of a new 
certificate to the subscriber without changing the subscriber or 
other participant's public key or any other information in the 
certificate:
 
* Circumstances under which certificate renewal takes place, such as 
where the certificate life has expired, but the policy permits the 
same key pair to be reused;
 
* Who may request certificate renewal, for instance, the subscriber, 
RA, or the CA may automatically renew an end-user subscriber 
certificate;
 
* A CA or RA's procedures to process renewal requests to issue the 
new certificate, for example, the use of a token, such as a 
password, to re-authenticate the subscriber, or procedures that are 
the same as the initial certificate issuance;

* Notification of the new certificate to the subscriber;
 
* Conduct constituting acceptance of the certificate; 
 
* Publication of the certificate by the CA; and
 
* Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities.

4.4.7 Certificate Re-key

This subcomponent is used to describe the following elements related 
to a subscriber or other participant generating a new key pair and 
applying for the issuance of new certificate that certifies the new 
public key:
 
* Circumstances under which certificate re-key can or must takes 
place, such as after a certificate is revoked for the reasons of key 
compromise or after a certificate has expired and the usage period 
of the key pair has also expired;
 
* Who may request certificate re-key, for example, the subscriber;
 
* A CA or RA's procedures to process re-keying requests to issue the 
new certificate, such as procedures that are the same as the initial 
certificate issuance;

* Notification of the new certificate to the subscriber;
 
* Conduct constituting acceptance of the certificate; 
 
* Publication of the certificate by the CA; and
 
Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 26]

* Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other 
entities.

4.4.8 Certificate Modification

This subcomponent is used to describe the following elements related 
to issuance of a new certificate due to changes in the information 
in the certificate other than the subscriber public key:
 
* Circumstances under which certificate modification can takes 
place, such as name change, role change, reorganization resulting a 
change in the DN;
 
* Who may request certificate modification, for instance, 
subscribers, human resources personnel, or the RA;
 
* A CA or RA's procedures to process modification requests to issue 
the new certificate, such as procedures that are the same as the 
initial certificate issuance;

* Notification of the new certificate to the subscriber;
 
* Conduct constituting acceptance of the certificate; 
 
* Publication of the certificate by the CA; and
 
* Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities.

4.4.9  Certificate Revocation and Suspension

This subcomponent addresses the following:
 
* Circumstances under which a certificate may be and circumstances 
under which it must be revoked, for instance, in cases of subscriber 
employment termination, loss of cryptographic token, or suspected 
compromise of the private key;
 
* Who can request the revocation of the participant's certificate, 
for example, the subscriber, RA, or CA in the case of an end-user 
subscriber certificate.
 
* Procedures used for certificate revocation request, such as a 
digitally signed message from the RA, a digitally signed message 
from the subscriber, or a phone call from the RA;
 
* The grace period available to the subscriber, within which the 
subscriber must make a revocation request;
 
* The time within which CA must process the revocation request;
 
* The mechanisms, if any, that a relying party may use or must use 
in order to check the status of certificates on which they wish to 
rely;

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 27]

* If a CRL mechanism is used, the issuance frequency;

* If a CRL mechanism is used, maximum latency between the generation 
of CRLs and posting of the CRLs to the repository (in other words, 
the maximum amount of processing- and communication-related delays 
in posting CRLs to the repository after the CRLs are generated);

* On-line revocation/status checking availability, for instance, 
OCSP and a web site to which status inquiries can be submitted;
 
* Requirements on relying parties to perform on-line 
revocation/status checks;
 
* Other forms of revocation advertisements available;
  
* Any variations on the above stipulations when the suspension or 
revocation is the result of private key compromise (as opposed to 
other reasons for suspension or revocation).

* Circumstances under which a certificate may be suspended;
 
* Who can request the suspension of a certificate, for example, the 
subscriber, human resources personnel, a supervisor of the 
subscriber, or the RA in the case of an end-user subscriber 
certificate;
 
* Procedures to request certificate suspension, such as a digitally 
signed message from subscriber or RA, or a phone call from RA; and
 
* How long the suspension may last.

4.4.10  Certificate Status Services

This subcomponent addresses the certificate status checking services 
available to the relying parties, including:

* The operational characteristics of certificate status checking services;

* The availability of such services, and any applicable policies on 
unavailability; and

* Any optional features of such services.

4.4.11  End of Subscription

This subcomponent addresses procedures used by the subscriber to end 
subscription to the CA services, including:

* The revocation of certificates at the end of subscription (which 
may differ, depending on whether the end of subscription was due to 
expiration of the certificate or termination of the service).

4.4.12  Key Escrow and Recovery

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 28]

This subcomponent contains the following elements to identify the 
policies and practices relating to the escrowing, and/or recovery of 
private keys where private key escrow services are available 
(through the CA or other trusted third parties):

* Identification of the document containing private key escrow and 
recovery policies and practices or a listing of the such policies 
and practices; and
 
* Identification of the document containing session key 
encapsulation and recovery policies and practices or a listing of 
such policies and practices.

4.5 MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONAL, AND PHYSICAL CONTROLS

This component describes non-technical security controls (that is, 
physical, procedural, and personnel controls) used by the issuing CA 
to perform securely the functions of key generation, subject 
authentication, certificate issuance, certificate revocation, audit, 
and archival.
 
This component can also be used to define non-technical security 
controls on repository, subject CAs, RAs, subscribers, and other 
participants.  The non-technical security controls for the subject 
CAs, RAs, subscribers, and other participants could be the same, 
similar, or very different.
 
These non-technical security controls are critical to trusting the 
certificates since lack of security may compromise CA operations 
resulting, for example, in the creation of certificates or CRLs with 
erroneous information or in the compromise of the CA private key.
 
Within each subcomponent, separate consideration will, in general, 
need to be given to each entity type, that is, issuing CA, 
repository, subject CAs, RAs, subscribers, and other participants.

4.5.1  Physical Security Controls

In this subcomponent, the physical controls on the facility housing 
the entity systems are described.  Topics addressed may include:
  
* Site location and construction, such as the construction 
requirements for high-security zones and the use of locked rooms, 
cages, safes, and cabinets;

* Physical access, i.e., mechanisms to control access from one area 
of the facility to another or access into high-security zones, such 
as locating CA operations in a secure computer room monitored by 
guards or security alarms and requiring movement from zone to zone 
to be accomplished using a token, biometric readers, and/or access 
control lists;

* Power and air conditioning;

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 29]

* Water exposures;

* Fire prevention and protection;

* Media storage, for example, requiring the storage of backup media 
in a separate location that is physically secure and protected from 
fire and water damages;

* Waste disposal; and

* Off-site backup.

4.5.2  Procedural Controls

In this subcomponent, requirements for recognizing trusted roles are 
described, together with the responsibilities for each role.  
Examples of trusted roles include system administrators, security 
officers, and system auditors.
 
For each task identified for each role, it should also be stated how 
many individuals are required to perform the task (n out m rule).  
Identification and authentication requirements for each role may 
also be defined.

This components also includes the separation of duties in terms of 
the roles that cannot be performed by the same individuals.
 
4.5.3  Personnel Security Controls

This subcomponent addresses the following:
 
* Qualifications, experience, and clearances that personnel must 
have as a condition of filling trusted roles or other important 
roles. Examples include credentials, job experiences, and official 
government clearances that candidates for these positions must have 
before being hired; 
 
* Background checks and clearance procedures that are required in 
connection with the hiring of personnel filling trusted roles or 
perhaps other important roles, such as requirements that trusted 
personnel undergo checks of their criminal records, references, and 
additional clearances that a participant undertakes after a decision 
has been made to hire a particular person;
 
* Training requirements and training procedures for each role 
following the hiring of personnel;
 
* Any retraining period and retraining procedures for each role 
after completion of initial training;
 
* Frequency and sequence for job rotation among various roles;
 
Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 30]

* Sanctions against personnel for unauthorized actions, 
unauthorized use of authority, and unauthorized use of entity 
systems for the purpose of imposing accountability on a 
participant's personnel; 
 
* Controls on personnel that are independent contractors rather than 
employees of the entity; examples include:
 
- Bonding requirements on contract personnel;
- Contractual requirements including indemnification for damages due 
to the actions of the contractor personnel;
- Audit and monitoring of contractor personnel; and
- Other controls on contracting personnel.

* Documentation to be supplied to personnel, during initial 
training, retraining, or otherwise.

4.5.4  Audit Logging Procedures

This subcomponent is used to describe event logging and audit 
systems, implemented for the purpose of maintaining a secure 
environment.  Elements include the following:
 
* Types of events recorded, such as certificate lifecycle 
operations, attempts to access the system, and requests made to the 
system;
 
* Frequency with which audit logs are processed or archived, for 
example, weekly, following an alarm or anomalous event, or when ever 
the audit log is n% full;
 
* Period for which audit logs are kept;
 
* Protection of audit logs:
 
- Who can view audit logs, for example only the audit administrator;
- Protection against modification of audit log, for instance a 
requirement that no one may modify or delete the audit records or 
that only an audit administrator may delete the audit file as part 
of rotating the audit file; and
- Protection against deletion of audit log.
 
* Audit log back up procedures;
 
* Whether the audit log accumulation system is internal or external 
to the entity;
 
* Whether the subject who caused an audit event to occur is notified 
of the audit action; and
  
* Vulnerability assessments, for example, where audit data is run 
through a tool that identifies potential attempts to breach the 
security of the system.

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 31]

4.5.5  Records Archival

This subcomponent is used to describe general records archival (or 
records retention) policies, including the following:
 
* Types of records that are archived, for example, all audit data, 
certificate application information, and documentation supporting 
certificate applications;
 
* Retention period for archive;
 
* Protection of archive:
 
- Who can view the archive, for example, a requirement that only the 
audit administrator may view the archive;
- Protection against modification of archive, such as storing the 
data on a write once medium;
- Protection against deletion of archive; and

- Protection against deterioration of the media on which the archive 
is stored, such as a requirement for data to be migrated 
periodically to fresh media.
 
* Archive backup procedures;
 
* Requirements for time-stamping of records;
 
* Whether the archive collection system is internal or external; and
 
* Procedures to obtain and verify archive information, such as a 
requirement that two separate copies of the archive data be kept 
under the control of two persons, and that the two copies be 
compared in order to ensure that the archive information is 
accurate.
 
4.5.6  Key Changeover

This subcomponent describes the procedures to provide a new public 
key to a CA's users following a re-key by the CA.  These procedures 
may be the same as the procedure for providing the current key.  
Also, the new key may be certified in a certificate signed using the 
old key. 
 
4.5.7  Compromise and Disaster Recovery

This subcomponent describes requirements relating to notification 
and recovery procedures in the event of compromise or disaster.  
Each of the following may need to be addressed separately:
 
* Identification or listing of the applicable incident and 
compromise reporting and handling procedures.

* The recovery procedures used if computing resources, software, 
and/or data are corrupted or suspected to be corrupted.  These 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 32]

procedures describe how a secure environment is reestablished, which 
certificates are revoked, whether the entity key is revoked, how 
the new entity public key is provided to the users, and how the 
subjects are re-certified.
 
* The recovery procedures used if the entity key is compromised.  
These procedures describe how a secure environment is reestablished, 
how the new entity public key is provided to the users, and how the 
subjects are re-certified.

* The entity's capabilities to ensure business continuity following 
a natural or other disaster.  Such capabilities may include the 
availability of a remote hot-site at which operations may be 
recovered.  They may also include procedures for securing its 
facility during the period of time following a natural or other 
disaster and before a secure environment is reestablished either at 
the original site or at a remote site.  For example, procedures to 
protect against theft of sensitive materials from an earthquake-
damaged site.
 
4.5.8  CA or RA Termination

This subcomponent describes requirements relating to procedures for 
termination and for termination notification of a CA or RA, 
including the identity of the custodian of CA and RA archival 
records.

4.6  TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS

This component is used to define the security measures taken by the 
issuing CA to protect its cryptographic keys and activation data 
(e.g., PINs, passwords, or manually-held key shares).  This 
component may also be used to impose constraints on repositories, 
subject CAs, subscribers, and other participants to protect their 
private keys, activation data for their private keys, and critical 
security parameters.  Secure key management is critical to ensure 
that all secret and private keys and activation data are protected 
and used only by authorized personnel.
 
This component also describes other technical security controls used 
by the issuing CA to perform securely the functions of key 
generation, user authentication, certificate registration, 
certificate revocation, audit, and archival.  Technical controls 
include life-cycle security controls (including software development 
environment security, trusted software development methodology) and 
operational security controls.
 
This component can also be used to define other technical security 
controls on repositories, subject CAs, RAs, subscribers, and other 
participants.

4.6.1  Key Pair Generation and Installation

Key pair generation and installation need to be considered for the 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 33]

issuing CA, repositories, subject CAs, RAs, and subscribers.  For 
each of these types of entities, the following questions 
potentially need to be answered:
 
1. Who generates the entity public, private key pair?  Possibilities 
include the subscriber, RA, or CA.  Also, how is the key generation 
performed?  Is the key generation performed in hardware or software?
 
2. How is the private key provided securely to the entity?  
Possibilities include a situation where the entity has generated it 
and therefore already has it, handing the entity the private key 
physically, mailing a token containing the private key securely, or 
delivering it in a SSL session.
 
3. How is the entity's public key provided securely to the 
certification authority?  Some possibilities are in an online SSL 
session or in a message signed by the RA.
 
4. In the case of issuing CAs, how is the CA's public key provided 
securely to potential relying parties?  Possibilities include 
handing the public key to the relying party securely in person, 
physically mailing a copy securely to the relying party, or 
delivering it in a SSL session.
 
5. What are the key sizes?  Examples include a 1,024 bit RSA modulus 
and a 1,024 bit DSA large prime.
 
6. Who generates the public key parameters, and is the quality of 
the parameters checked during key generation?
 
7. For what purposes may the key be used, or for what purposes 
should usage of the key be restricted?  For X.509 certificates, 
these purposes should map to the key usage flags in X.509 Version 3 
certificates.

4.6.2  Private Key Protection and Cryptographic Module Engineering 
Controls

Requirements for private key protection and cryptographic module 
need to be considered for the issuing CA, repositories, subject CAs, 
RAs, and subscribers.  For each of these types of entity, the 
following questions potentially need to be answered:
 
1.  What standards, if any, are required for the cryptographic 
module used to generate the keys?  A cryptographic module can be 
composed of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination of 
them.  For example, are the keys certified by the infrastructure 
required to be generated using modules compliant with the US FIPS 
140-1?  If so, what is the required FIPS 140-1 level of the module?  
Are there any other engineering or other controls relating to a 
cryptographic module, such as the identification of the 
cryptographic module boundary, input/output, roles and services, 
finite state machine, physical security, software security, 
operating system security, algorithm compliance, electromagnetic 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 34]

compatibility, and self tests. 

2.  Is the private key under n out of m multi-person control?(6)  
If yes, provide n and m (two person control is a special case of n 
out of m, where n = m = 2)?
 
3.  Is the private key escrowed?(7)  If so, who is the escrow agent, 
what form is the key escrowed in (examples include plaintext, 
encrypted, split key), and what are the security controls on the 
escrow system?
 
4.  Is the private key backed up?  If so, who is the backup agent, 
what form is the key backed up in (examples include plaintext, 
encrypted, split key), and what are the security controls on the 
backup system?
 
5.  Is the private key archived?  If so, who is the archival agent, 
what form is the key archived in (examples include plaintext, 
encrypted, split key), and what are the security controls on the 
archival system?
 
6.  Under what circumstances, if any, can a private key be 
transferred into or from a cryptographic module?  Who is permitted 
to perform such a transfer operation?  In what form is the private 
key during the transfer (i.e., plaintext, encrypted, or split key)?

7.  How is the private key stored in the module (i.e., plaintext, 
encrypted, or split key)?
 
8.  Who can activate (use) the private key?  What actions must be 
performed to activate the private key (e.g., login, power on, supply 
PIN, insert token/key, automatic, etc.)?  Once the key is activated, 
is the key active for an indefinite period, active for one time, or 
active for a defined time period?
 
9.  Who can deactivate the private key and how?  Examples of methods 
of deactivating private keys include logging out, turning the power 
off, removing the token/key, automatic deactivation, and time 
expiration.

10. Who can destroy the private key and how?  Examples of methods of 
destroying private keys include token surrender, token destruction, 
and overwriting the key.

11. Provide the capabilities of the cryptographic module in the 
following areas: identification of the cryptographic module 
boundary, input/output, roles and services, finite state machine, 
physical security, software security, operating system security, 
algorithm compliance, electromagnetic compatibility, and self tests.  
Capability may be expressed through reference to compliance with a 
standard such as U.S. FIPS 140-1, associated level, and rating.

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 35]

4.6.3  Other Aspects of Key Pair Management

Other aspects of key management need to be considered for the 
issuing CA, repositories, subject CAs, RAs, subscribers, and other 
participants.  For each of these types of entity, the following 
questions potentially need to be answered:

1. Is the public key archived?  If so, who is the archival agent and 
what are the security controls on the archival system?  The archival 
system should provide integrity controls other than digital 
signatures since: the archival period may be greater than the 
cryptanalysis period for the key and the archive requires tamper 
protection, which is not provided by digital signatures.

2. What is the operational period of the certificates issued to the 
subscriber.  What are the usage periods, or active lifetimes, for 
the subscriber's key pair?

4.6.4  Activation Data
 
Activation data refers to data values other than whole private keys 
that are required to operate private keys or cryptographic modules 
containing private keys, such as a PIN, passphrase, or portions of a 
private key used in a key-splitting scheme.  Protection of 
activation data prevents unauthorized use of the private key, and 
potentially needs to be considered for the issuing CA, subject CAs, 
RAs, and subscribers.  Such consideration potentially needs to 
address the entire life-cycle of the activation data from generation 
through archival and destruction.  For each of the entity types 
(issuing CA, repository, subject CA, RA, subscriber, and other 
participants) all of the questions listed in 4.6.1 through 4.6.3 
potentially need to be answered with respect to activation data 
rather than with respect to keys.

4.6.5  Computer Security Controls

This subcomponent is used to describe computer security controls 
such as: use of the trusted computing base concept, discretionary 
access control, labels, mandatory access controls, object reuse, 
audit, identification and authentication, trusted path, security 
testing, and penetration testing.  Product assurance may also be 
addressed.
 
A computer security rating for computer systems may be required.  
The rating could be based, for example, on the Trusted System 
Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), Canadian Trusted Products Evaluation 
Criteria, European Information Technology Security Evaluation 
Criteria (ITSEC), or the Common Criteria for Information Technology 
Security Evaluation, ISO/IEC 15408:1999. This subcomponent can also 
address requirements for product evaluation analysis, testing, 
profiling, product certification, and/or product accreditation 
related activity undertaken.

4.6.6  Life Cycle Security Controls

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 36]

This subcomponent addresses system development controls and 
security management controls.
 
System development controls include development environment 
security, development personnel security, configuration management 
security during product maintenance, software engineering practices, 
software development methodology, modularity, layering, use of 
failsafe design and implementation techniques (e.g., defensive 
programming) and development facility security.
 
Security management controls include execution of tools and 
procedures to ensure that the operational systems and networks 
adhere to configured security.  These tools and procedures include 
checking the integrity of the security software, firmware, and 
hardware to ensure their correct operation.

This subcomponent can also address life-cycle security  ratings 
based, for example, on the Trusted Software Development Methodology 
(TSDM) level IV and V, independent life-cycle security controls 
audit, and the Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity 
Model (SEI-CMM).

4.6.7  Network Security Controls

This subcomponent addresses network security related controls, 
including firewalls.

4.6.8  Time-stamping

This subcomponent addresses requirements or practices relating to 
the use of timestamps on various data.  It may also discuss whether 
or not the time-stamping application must use a trusted time source.
 
4.7  CERTIFICATE AND CRL PROFILES

This component is used to specify the certificate format and, if 
CRLs and/or OCSP are used, the CRL and/or OCSP format.  This 
includes information on profiles, versions, and extensions used.

4.7.1  Certificate Profile

This subcomponent addresses such topics as the following 
(potentially by reference to a separate profile definition, such as 
the one defined in IETF PKIX RFC 2459):

* Version number(s) supported;

* Certificate extensions populated and their criticality;

* Cryptographic algorithm object identifiers;

* Name forms used for the CA, RA, and subscriber names;
 
Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 37]

* Name constraints used and the name forms used in the name 
constraints;

* Applicable CP OID(s);

* Usage of the policy constraints extension;
 
* Policy qualifiers syntax and semantics; and
 
* Processing semantics for the critical CP extension.

4.7.2  CRL Profile

This subcomponent addresses such topics as the following 
(potentially by reference to a separate profile definition, such as 
the one defined in IETF PKIX RFC 2459):

* Version numbers supported for CRLs; and
 
* CRL and CRL entry extensions populated and their criticality.
 
4.7.3  OCSP Profile

This subcomponent addresses such topics as the following 
(potentially by reference to a separate profile definition, such as 
the IETF RFC 2560 profile):

* Version of OCSP that is being used as the basis for establishing 
an OCSP system; and
 
* OCSP extensions populated and their criticality.

4.8  COMPLIANCE AUDIT AND OTHER ASSESSMENT

This component addresses the following:  

* The list of topics covered by the assessment and/or the assessment 
methodology used to perform the assessment; examples include 
WebTrust for CAs (8) and SAS 70 (9).

 * Frequency of compliance audit or other assessment for each entity 
that must be assessed pursuant to a CP or CPS, or the circumstances 
that will trigger an assessment; possibilities include an annual 
audit, pre-operational assessment as a condition of allowing an 
entity to being operations, or investigation following a possible or 
actual compromise of security.

* The identity and/or qualifications of the personnel performing the 
audit or other assessment.

* The relationship between the assessor and the entity being 
assessed, including the degree of independence of the assessor.

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 38]

* Actions taken as a result of deficiencies found during the 
assessment; examples include a temporary suspension of operations 
until deficiencies are corrected, revocation of certificates issued 
to the assessed entity, changes in personnel, triggering special 
investigations or more frequent subsequent compliance assessments, 
and claims for damages against the assessed entity.

* Who is entitled to see results of an assessment (e.g., assessed 
entity, other participants, the general public), who provides them 
(e.g., the assessor or the assessed entity), and how they are 
communicated.

4.9  OTHER BUSINESS AND LEGAL MATTERS

In all cases below, the CP or CPS itself may purport to impose terms 
on participants to the extent the CP or CPS is a contract or part of 
a contract, or the CP or CPS may contain requirements that such 
terms appear in separate agreements, such as subscriber agreements 
and relying party agreements.

4.9.1  Fees

This subcomponent contains any applicable provisions regarding fees 
charged by CAs, repositories, or RAs, such as:
 
* Certificate issuance or renewal fees;
 
* Certificate access fees;
 
* Revocation or status information access fees;
 
* Fees for other services such as providing access to the relevant 
CP or CPS; and
 
* Refund policy.
 
4.9.2  Financial Responsibility

This subcomponent contains requirements or disclosures relating to 
the resources available to CAs, RAs, and other participants 
providing certification services to support performance of their 
operational responsibilities, and to remain solvent and pay damages 
in the event they are liable to pay a judgment or settlement in 
connection with a claim arising out of their operations.  Such 
provisions include:

* A statement that the participant maintains a certain amount of 
insurance coverage for its liabilities to other participants;

* A statement that a participant has access to other resources to 
support operations and pay damages for potential liability, which 
may be couched in terms of a minimum level of assets necessary to 
operate and cover contingencies that might occur within a PKI, where 
examples include assets on the balance sheet of an organization, a 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 39]

surety bond, a letter of credit, and a right under an agreement 
to an indemnity under certain circumstances; and

* A statement that a participant has a program that offers first-
party insurance or warranty protection to other participants in 
connection with their use of the PKI.

4.9.3  Confidentiality of Business Information

This subcomponent contains provisions relating to the treatment of 
confidential business information that participants may communicate 
to each other, such as business plans, sales information, trade 
secrets, and information received from a third party under a 
nondisclosure agreement.  Specifically, this subcomponent addresses:

* The scope of what is considered confidential information,

* The types of information that are considered to be outside the 
scope of confidential information, and

* The responsibilities of participants that receive confidential 
information to secure it from compromise, and refrain from using it 
or disclosing it to third parties.

4.9.4  Privacy of Personal Information

This subcomponent relates to the protection that participants, 
particularly CAs, RAs, and repositories, may be required to afford 
to personally identifiable private information of certificate 
applicants, subscribers, and other participants.  In specific, this 
subcomponent addresses the following, to the extent pertinent under 
applicable law:

* The designation and disclosure of the applicable privacy plan that 
applies to a participant's activities, if required by applicable law 
or policy;

* Information that is or is not considered private within the PKI;

* Any responsibility of participants that receive private 
information to secure it, and refrain from using it and from 
disclosing it to third parties;

* Any requirements as to notices to, or consent from individuals 
regarding use or disclosure of private information; and

* Any circumstances under which a participant is entitled or 
required to disclose private information pursuant to judicial, 
administrative process in a private or governmental proceeding, or 
in any legal proceeding. 

4.9.5  Intellectual Property Rights

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 40]

This subcomponent addresses the intellectual property rights, 
such as copyright, patent, trademarks, or trade secrets, that 
certain participants may have or claim in a CP, CPS, certificates, 
names, and keys, or are the subject of a license to or from 
participants.

4.9.6  Representations and Warranties

This subcomponent can include representations and warranties of 
various entities that are being made pursuant to the CP or CPS.  For 
example, a CPS that serves as a contract may contain a CA's warranty 
that information in the certificate is accurate.  This subcomponent 
can also include requirements that representations and warranties 
appear in certain agreements, such as subscriber or relying party 
agreements.  For instance, a CP may contain a requirement that all 
CAs utilize a subscriber agreement, and that a subscriber agreement 
must contain a warranty by the CA that information in the 
certificate is accurate.

Participants that may make representations and warranties include 
CAs, RAs, subscribers, relying parties, and other participants.

4.9.7  Disclaimers of Warranties

This subcomponent can include disclaimers of express warranties that 
may otherwise be deemed to exist in an agreement, and disclaimers of 
implied warranties that may otherwise be imposed by applicable law, 
such as warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular 
purpose.  The CP or CPS may impose such disclaimers, or the CP or 
CPS may contain a requirement that disclaimers appear in agreements, 
such as subscriber or relying party agreements. 

4.9.8  Limitations of Liability

This subcomponent can include limitations of liability in a CP or 
CPS or limitations that appear or must appear in an agreement.  
These limitations may fall into one of two categories:  limitations 
on the elements of damages recoverable and limitations on the amount 
of damages recoverable, also known as liability caps.  Often, 
contracts contain clauses preventing the recovery of elements of 
damages such as incidental and consequential damages, and sometimes 
punitive damages.  Frequently, contracts contain clauses that limit 
the possible recovery of one party or the other to an amount certain 
or to an amount corresponding to a benchmark, such as the amount a 
vendor was paid under the contract.

4.9.9  Indemnities

This subcomponent includes provisions by which one party makes a 
second party whole for losses or damage incurred by the second 
party, typically arising out of the first party's conduct.  They may 
appear in a CP, CPS, or agreement.  For example, a CP may require 
that subscriber agreements contain a term under which a subscriber 
is responsible for indemnifying a CA for losses the CA sustains 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 41]

arising out of a subscriber's fraudulent misrepresentations on the 
certificate application under which the CA issued the subscriber 
an inaccurate certificate.   Similarly, a CPS may say that a CA uses 
a relying party agreement, under which relying parties are 
responsible for indemnifying a CA for losses the CA sustains arising 
out of use of a certificate without properly checking revocation 
information or use of a certificate for purposes beyond what the CA 
permits.

4.9.10  Term and Termination

This subcomponent can include the time period in which a CP or a CPS 
remains in force and the circumstances under which the document, 
portions of the document, or its applicability to a particular 
participant can be terminated.  In addition or alternatively, the CP 
or CPS may include requirements that certain term and termination 
clauses appear in agreements, such as subscriber or relying party 
agreements.  In particular, such terms include:

* The term of a document or agreement, that is, when the document 
becomes effective and when it expires if it is not terminated 
earlier.

* Termination provisions stating circumstances under which the 
document, certain portions of it, or its application to a particular 
participant ceases to remain in effect.

* Any consequences of termination of the document.  For example, 
certain provisions of an agreement may survive its termination and 
remain in force.  Examples include acknowledgements of intellectual 
property rights and confidentiality provisions.  Also, termination 
may trigger a responsibility of parties to return confidential 
information to the party that disclosed it.

4.9.11  Individual notices and communications with participants

This subcomponent discusses the way in which one participant can or 
must communicate with another participant on a one-to-one basis in 
order for such communications to be legally effective.  For example, 
an RA may wish to inform the CA that it wishes to terminate its 
agreement with the CA.  This subcomponent is different from 
publication and repository functions, because unlike individual 
communications described in this subcomponent, publication and 
posting to a repository are for the purpose of communicating to a 
wide audience of recipients, such as all relying parties.  This 
subcomponent may establish mechanisms for communication and indicate 
the contact information to be used to route such communications, 
such as digitally signed e-mail notices to a specified address, 
followed by a signed e-mail acknowledgement of receipt.

4.9.12  Amendments

It will occasionally be necessary to amend a CP or CPS.  Some of 
these changes will not materially reduce the assurance that a CP or 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 42]

its implementation provides, and will be judged by the policy 
administrator to have an insignificant effect on the acceptability 
of certificates.  Such changes to a CP or CPS need not require a 
change in the CP OID or the CPS pointer (URL).  On the other hand, 
some changes to a specification will materially change the 
acceptability of certificates for specific purposes, and these 
changes may require corresponding changes to the CP OID or CPS 
pointer qualifier (URL).
 
This subcomponent may also contain the following information:
 
* The procedures by which the CP or CPS and/or other documents must, 
may be, or are amended.  In the case of CP or CPS amendments, change 
procedures may include a notification mechanism to provide notice of 
proposed amendments to affected parties, such as subscribers and 
relying parties; a comment period; a mechanism by which comments are 
received, reviewed and incorporated into the document; and a 
mechanism by which amendments become final and effective.
 
* The circumstances under which amendments to the CP or CPS would 
require a change in CP OID or CPS pointer (URL).
 

4.9.13  Dispute Resolution Procedures

This subcomponent discusses procedures utilized to resolve disputes 
arising out of the CP, CPS, and/or agreements.  Examples of such 
procedures include requirements that disputes be resolved in a 
certain forum or by alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
 
4.9.14  Governing Law

This subcomponent sets forth a statement that the law of a certain 
jurisdiction governs the interpretation and enforcement of the 
subject CP or CPS or agreements.  

4.9.15  Compliance with Applicable Law

This subcomponent relates to stated requirements that participants 
comply with applicable law, for example laws relating to 
cryptographic hardware and software that may be subject to the 
export control laws of a given jurisdiction.  The CP or CPS could 
purport to impose such requirements or may require that such 
provisions appear in other agreements. 

4.9.16  Miscellaneous Provisions

This subcomponent contains miscellaneous provisions sometimes called 
"boilerplate provisions" in contracts. The clauses covered in this 
subcomponent may appear in a CP, CPS, or agreements and include:
 
* An entire agreement clause, which typically identifies the 
document or documents comprising the entire agreement between the 
parties and states that such agreements supersedes all prior and 

Chokhani, Ford, Sabett, Merrill, & Wu    INTERNET DRAFT    [Page 43]

contemporaneous written or oral understandings relating to the same 
subject matter;

* An assignment clause, which may act to limit the ability of a 
party to an agreement to assign its rights under the agreement to 
another party (such as the right to receive a stream of payments in 
the future) or the ability of a party to delegate its obligations 
under the agreement;

* A severability clause, which sets forth the intentions of the 
parties in the event a court or other tribunal determines that a 
clause within an agreement is, for some reason, invalid or 
unenforceable, and whose purpose is frequently to prevent the 
unenforceability of one clause from causing the whole agreement to 
be unenforceable; and

* An enforcement clause, which may state that a party prevailing in 
any dispute arising out of an agreement is entitled to attorneys' 
fees as part of its recovery, or may state that a party's waiver of 
one breach of contract does not constitute a continuing waiver or a 
future waiver of other breaches of contract.

4.9.17  Other Provisions

This subcomponent is a "catchall" location where additional 
responsibilities and terms can be imposed on PKI participants that 
do not neatly fit within one of the other components or 
subcomponents of the framework.  CP and CPS writers can place any 
provision within this subcomponent that is not covered by another 
subcomponent.

5. OUTLINE OF A SET OF PROVISIONS

This section contains a recommended outline for a set of provisions, 
intended to serve as a checklist or (with some further development) 
a standard template for use by CP or CPS writers.  Such a common 
outline will facilitate:
 
(a)  Comparison of two certificate policies during cross-
certification or other forms of interoperation (for the purpose of 
equivalency mapping).
 
(b) Comparison of a CPS with a CP to ensure that the CPS faithfully 
implements the policy.
 
(c) Comparison of two CPSs.

In order to comply with the RFC, the drafters of a compliant CP or 
CPS are strongly advised to adhere to this outline.  While use of 
alternate outline is discouraged, it may be accepted if a proper 
justification is provided for the deviation and a mapping table is 
provided to readily discern where each of the items described in 
this outline is provided.

NOTES
1 A paper copy of the ABA Digital Signature Guidelines can be 
purchased from the ABA.  See http://www.abanet.com for ordering 
details.  The DSG may also be downloaded without charge from the ABA 
website at 
http://www.abanet.org/scitech/ec/isc/digital_signature.html.

3  The term "meaningful" means that the name form has commonly 
understood semantics to determine identity of the person and/or 
organization.  Directory names and RFC 822 names may be more or less 
meaningful.
 
4 The subject may not need to prove to the CA that the subject has 
possession of the private key corresponding to the public key being 
registered if the CA generates the subject's key pair on the 
subject's behalf. 
 
5 Examples of means to identify and authenticate individuals include 
biometric means (such as thumb print, ten finger print, and scan of 
the face, palm, or retina), a driver's license, a credit card, a 
company badge, and a government badge.
 
6 The n out of m rule allows a private key to be split in m parts.  
The m parts may be given to m different individuals.  Any n parts 
out of the m parts may be used to fully reconstitute the private 
key, but having any n-1 parts provides one with no information about 
the private key.
 
7 A private key may be escrowed, backed up, or archived.  Each of 
these functions has a different purpose.  Thus, a private key may go 
through any subset of these functions depending on the requirements.  
The purpose of escrow is to allow a third party (such as an 
organization or government) to obtain the private key without the 
cooperation of the subscriber.  The purpose of back up is to allow 
the subscriber to reconstitute the key in case of the destruction or 
corruption of the key for business continuity purposes.  The

purpose of archive is to provide for reuse of the private key in 
future, e.g., use to decrypt a document.

Authorities," from the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants, Inc., and the Canadian Institute of Chartered
