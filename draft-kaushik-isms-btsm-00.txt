Abstract

   In response to the need for a security model for SNMP that integrates
   with other device security models, we specify the use of BEEP
   combined with SASL and TLS as a transport for SNMP requests and
   responses.  We define a URI and specify a BEEP profile to be used.

1.  Introduction

   [EDITOR NOTE: This is a drafty draft.]

   The current SNMPv3 security model USM does not integrate well with
   other authentication and access controls on devices.[9].  For
   example, it is impossible to integrate USM with RADIUS.[4]  In
   addition, SNMP's UDP transport poses certain limitations, such as the
   need for application awareness at firewalls and network address
   translators (NATs) in order to properly process requests.

1.1  Authentication Design Considerations

   No new authentication mechanism is needed for SNMP.  Instead,
   integration with the existing approaches is appropriate.  Hence, an
   approach that makes use of general authentication mechanisms that can
   in turn call more specific functions will provide the most
   flexibility to meeting end user requirements.

1.2  Transport Design Decisions

   SNMP has traditionally been transported over UDP.  There are good
   reasons for this approach.  Because SNMP is a network management
   protocol, if a network failure occurs it may prove difficult to
   impossible to establish a TCP connection.  In addition, the cost of
   connection state on both the network element and the network
   management station has been viewed as concern.  For those uses where
   these concern remains SNMP over UDP remains a viable alternative.

   However, since the time SNMP was first designed the network
   architecture has shifted substantially.  Two critical components,
   firewalls and NATs have become prevalent.  Both NATs and firewalls
   make UDP communication anywhere from spotty to impossible, depending
   on as much implementation as policy, where it would be clearly more
   desirable for the limitation to be solely based on policy.

   Because connection state is available for all to inspect, NATs and
   firewalls have an easy time of determining who initiated a
   communication and on what port.  Hence, a policy decision is easier
   than it would be in UDP where state must be maintained within the
   application.  Use of transport layer security allows connection state
   state to remain out in the open, even when the application protocol
   is encrypted.

   Finally, many firealls and NATs will allow communiations only in a
   single direction - outbound from the device being protected or being
   "NATted", and so a "call-home" function is desirable.

1.3  Choice of BEEP

   There are several substantial benefits for Block Extensible Exchange
   Protocol (BEEP).[5] First, it meets the fundamental need of operators
   to integrate with existing authentication infrastructure.  It can do
   this through the use of SASL, which can invoke Radius or other
   centralized password verification mechanisms to authenticate
   sessions.[2] BEEP uses SASL for authentication and TLS to provide
   confidentiality and integrity protection.[3]

   A TCP transport mapping is defined for BEEP.[6].  This combined with
   its peer to peer approach allows for TCP connections to originate in
   either direction independently of whether an end plays the role of
   the manager or the managed element.

   In addition network management operations typically happen via a
   variety of managament protocols (e.g., NETCONF, SNMP, SYSLOG) and in
   The use of BEEP will potentially allow a single BEEP session for all
   management protocols and will require only one authentication
   transaction per pair of devices.

   As mentioned earlier, BEEP is an ideal as a transport protocol for
   peer to peer communication model, which is similar to the one
   described for SNMP in RFC3411 [8].  The fact that any peer can
   initiate a connection simplifies NAT and firewall traversal.

2.  The BEEP Transport Mapping

   All SNMP over BEEP implementations MUST implement the profile and
   functional mapping between SNMP and BEEP as described below.

2.1  Session Establishment

   Either device at the end of a BEEP connection may play the role of an
   initiator.  Devices MUST be configured to listen to or connect using
   a specific BEEP transport connection.  Port XXX is assigned for BEEP
   over SNMP.  Alternatively, the SNMP profile may be announced on any
   BEEP transport connection where the security policies match.

2.2  Greeting(s)

   After a transport connection is established, as greetings are
   exchanged, devices SHOULD each announce support for TLS, and
   optionally SASL.  For instance:







Narayan, et al.         Expires January 12, 2006                [Page 4]


Internet-Draft                    BTSM                         July 2005


          L: RPY 0 0 . 0 110
          L: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
          L:
          L: <greeting>
          L:    <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/TLS' />
          L: </greeting>


   Once greetings are exchanged, if TLS is announced as above, the
   listener STARTs a channel with the TLS profile.  Once TLS has been
   successfully negotiated a new greeting is sent by both initiator and
   listener.  This new greeting will contain any available SASL profiles
   along with the SNMP profile, http://iana.org/beep/snmp.

2.3  SASL

   If SASL profiles are specified, a channel is started by either or
   both sides with the list of SASL profiles available.  An answer is
   then supplied indicating which profile is to be used for
   authentication.  For examples, see RFC-3080.

2.4  SNMP Channel Initiation

   Either initiator or listner MAY advertise the SNMP profile.  If
   neither advertises the profile or if the initiator advertises the
   profile but the listener is not configured to use it or any other
   profile, the listener should shutdown the BEEP connection (see below)
   and log an error that indicates that nobody wanted to actually use
   the BEEP connection for anything.

   For example:


          I: MSG 0 1 . 52 116
          I: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
          I:
          I: <start number='1'>
          I:    <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/SNMP' />
          I: </start>
          I: END


   In this case the initiator has started the SNMP channel.  If it is
   successful, the other end will respond with a positive RPY.  For
   example:






Narayan, et al.         Expires January 12, 2006                [Page 5]


Internet-Draft                    BTSM                         July 2005


          L: RPY 0 1 . 221 83
          L: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
          L:
          L: <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/SNMP' />
          L: END


   Conversely if the channel cannot be created, an ERR response is sent.

2.5  Use of the SNMP channel

   The SNMP channel is used to transmit complete SNMP PDUs encoded in
   ASN.1.

2.6  SNMP Notifications


2.7  Passing Security Parameters from SNMPv3


2.8  Authentication Model

   Authentication will occur at two places.  One is where transport
   layer security such as TLS is provided and the other is at the
   application layer where a mechanism such as SASL can be used.  Both
   of these mechanisms can support a variety of credentials and both can
   provide a security layer.  In cases where the participants have
   different types of credentials then it is likely that both will be
   needed.  This specification makes the following recommendations:
   1.  The TLS channel used to provide channel protection.  At the very
       least the BEEP listener MUST provide an X.509 certificate and
       each side that side (listener or initiator) MUST have a reliable
       trust anchor with appropriate policies to handle a network
       failure.
   2.  If both parties are authenticated during the TLS conversation
       then SASL EXTERNAL method is used.
   3.  If one party is not authenticated during the TLS conversation
       then an appropriate SASL mechanism is invoked to authenticate the
       un-authenticated party.  It is RECOMMENDED to implement SASL-
       DIGEST mechanism.  Other SASL mechanisms may be supported.  SASL
       PLAIN MAY be used if the back-end authentication mechanism does
       not support digests AND TLS is used.  PLAIN MUST NOT be used if
       TLS is not used.
   4.  In some cases it is possible that the side that is accepting the
       initial connection does not have the credentials to act as a TLS
       server.  The may happen when an SNMP engine is initiating a
       connection to send a notification and it has public key based
       credentials and the notification receiver is expected to use



Narayan, et al.         Expires January 12, 2006                [Page 6]


Internet-Draft                    BTSM                         July 2005


       password based credentials.  In this case TLS may be proceed with
       the connection initiator acting as the TLS server and the
       connection acceptor acting as TLS client.  The capability to act
       as a TLS server with an entity is advertised through the BEEP
       channel negotiation.  If both sides indicate they can act as a
       TLS server that the entity accepting the connection assumes the
       server role.

   It is expected that Recipient SNMP engines will be authenticated
   through TLS and must either have a public/private key pair and
   certificate or share a key with the command generator or notification
   receiver.  Originator SNMP engines will be authenticated through TLS
   or a SASL mechanism.  This allows them to use a wide variety of
   credentials such as passwords, public key certificates, Kerberos
   tickets, and shared keys.

3.  Identities used for authentication

   As described in the previous section, the specification deals will
   authentication at two levels, i.e. authentication of the end points
   to setup the channel and authentication of the application principal.
   RFC3411 does have a notion of two separate identities, the SNMP
   engines are identified by thier engineID, i.e. the snmpEngineID and
   client principal is identified by the securityName.

   The SNMP securityName MUST be used in all cases to represent the
   authenticated name of the client principal but the snmpEngineID may
   not be used to represent the authenticated name of the SNMP engine.
   SNMP engine implementations MUST provide a  mapping from the
   authenticated name to an engineID.

   Recipient SNMP engines may authenticate using a X.509 certificate,
   the snmpEngineID may be used as the subject Name within the X.509
   certificate.  In case a different entity is used as subject Name, the
   Recipient SNMP engines MUST be able to map the authenticated entity
   to the engineID.  Implementations may have this mapping configured as
   part of SNMPv3 engine configuration.  Originator SNMP engines MUST
   authenticate with the SNMP securityName and the securityName MUST be
   defined as the subject Name within the X.509 certificate in case of
   PKI authentication of the client principal.

4.  SNMPv3 Security Model Requirements


5.  Re-use of BEEP substrate

   BEEP is designed to allow multiple independent subsystems communicate
   over a single transport stream.  This is appropriate under certain



Narayan, et al.         Expires January 12, 2006                [Page 7]


Internet-Draft                    BTSM                         July 2005


   circumstances.  In those cases where an appropriate transport
   connection already exists, the SNMP profile is simply announced as
   part of the greeting by one side of the connection and invoked by the
   other.

5.1  Considerations for Substrate Re-use

   We consider the question of whether re-use of a particular substrate
   is appropriate based on RFC-3205 (BCP-56) Section 3.[7]  In this
   example we will look at the NETCONF over BEEP mapping as the other
   application running on top of the substrate.[10]

   The principle question from BCP-56 is this: does addition of one of
   the two protocols in question represent a substantially new service?
   The answer is clearly not.  We know this because the whole point of
   SNMP over BEEP with SASL/TLS is to integrate the security model with
   that of the rest of the administrative model on the device, which is
   what NETCONF is expected to use.  We further know this because the
   sort of data the protocols are meant to carry are substantially
   similar.

   What's more, there are two substantial benefits of combining the two:
   o  Improved network performance and fairness through the use of a
      shared TCP window as discussed in [11].  This may be a  minor or
      major point, but it's a bit early to say.
   o  Simplified configuration and improved performance on firewalls,
      and potentially on end devices as well.  It's one less port to
      have to keep track of, and it's one less port check to have to
      process.

   For these reasons it is reasonable to consider using SNMP and NETCONF
   on the same BEEP channel.  A similar analysis should be done with
   other potential applications.  For instance, it is unlikely that one
   would make use of an insecure channel for SNMP, such as what might be
   found with instant messaging protocols.

6.  Security Considerations

   This BEEP profile marks a departure from USM in several respects.
   First, the localization algorithm is not used.  Instead,
   authentication occurs through TLS and/or SASL.  It is therefore
   possible and indeed likely that a system will be configured to use a
   centralized password database.  USM prevents compromised of such
   databases when a network element is compromised.  If an attacker has
   full access to the network element that includes what code is
   running, such attacks may again be possible.

   The level of protocol security through the approach in this

Internet-Draft                    BTSM                         July 2005


   specification is extremely flexible, and is as much a choice of
   deployment as it is implementation.  For instance, MD5-DIGEST can
   only be used if the back-end store supports it.  As of this writing
   most RADIUS implemetnations do not.  So long the underlying transport
   is encrypted, the risk is limited to an attack on the encryption
   method, the device, or the radius server itself.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA will assign a TCP port for this specification.

   The IANA will register "http://iana.org/BEEP/SNMP" as a BEEP profile.
