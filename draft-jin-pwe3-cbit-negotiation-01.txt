1. Introduction

   This draft describes the problem of control word negotiation 
   mechanism specified in [RFC4447].

   Based on the problem analysis, possible solutions and their potential 
   shortcomings are also discussed.

2. Problem Statement

   [RFC4447] section 6 describes the control word negotiation mechanism. 
   Each PW endpoint has the capability of being configurable with a 
   parameter that specifies whether the use of the control word is 
   PREFERRED or NOT PREFERRED.
 
   This negotiation mechanism will not work properly in the following 
   case:
             +-------+                    +-------+
             |       |         PW         |       |
             |  PE1  |====================|  PE2  |
             |       |                    |       |
             +-------+                    +-------+
                            Figure 1

     1. Initially, the control word on PE1 is configured to PREFERRED, 
        and on PE2 to NOT PREFERRED.

     2. The negotiation result for the control word for this PW is "not 
        supported", and PE1 send label mapping with CW=0 finally.

     3. PE2 then changes its control word configuration to PREFERRED.

     4. PE2 will then send label withdraw message to PE1.

     5. According to the control word negotiation mechanism, the 
        received label mapping on PE2 from PE1 indicates CW=0, therefore 
        PE2 will still send label mapping with CW=0.

     6. The negotiation result for the PW control word is still "not 
        supported", even though the control word configuration on both 
        PE1 and PE2 is set to PREFERRED.

3. Possible Solutions

   The solution for this problem should be applicable to both SS-PW and 
   MS-PW.

   In this draft, possible solutions are discussed.

3.1. Option 1: Control Word Re-Negotiation by Label Request

   In this option, the control word re-negotiation is operated by adding 
   label request message. The control word negotiation mechanism can 
   still follow the procedure described in [RFC4447] section 6.

   The behavior of PE1 and PE2 should be as follows:

     1. PE2 changes locally configured control word to PREFERRED.

     2. PE2 will then send label withdraw message to PE1.

     3. When PE doing the CW changing operation, PE2 needs to send label 
        request to PE1 although it already received the label mapping.

     4. PE1 will send label release in reply to label withdraw message 
        from PE2.

     5. PE1 will send label mapping message with Cbit=1 again to PE2 
        (Note: PE1 SHOULD send label mapping with locally configured CW 
         parameter).

     6. PE2 receives the label mapping from PE1 and updates the remote 
        label binding information.

     7. PE2 will send label mapping to PE1 with CW=1.

   It should be noted that the request message should be processed in 
   ordered mode in MS-PW case. When S-PE receives a label request 
   message from a remote, it should advertise the request message to the 
   other remote PE. This is necessary since S-PE does not have full 
   information of interface parameter field in the FEC advertisement.

   By sending label request message, PE2 will get the configured CW 
   parameter from peer PE1 from receiving label mapping message. By 
   using the new CW parameter from label mapping message sent by peer
   PE1 and locally configured CW, PE2 will determine the control word
   parameter according to [RFC4447] section 6.

3.2. Option 2: Make CW Non-Configurable

   The second solution is to change the control word to be not 
   configurable, and default value is PREFERRED which can be degraded to 
   NOT PREFERRED by negotiation automatically. The negotiation mechanism 
   can still follow the procedure described in [RFC4447] section 6.

   There is explicit requirement from some service providers to allow 
   control word to be configurable. This option will not fulfill their 
   need.

3.3. Option 3: Manual Configuration Process for CW
 
   The third solution is to abandon the control word negotiation 
   mechanism described in [RFC4447], and use a new simple mechanism.

   When receiving the CW bit from peer PE, local PE should simply 
   compare the control word with local configuration (PREFERRED or 
   not-PREFERRED). Only when the control word configured on both 
   end-points of PW is PREFERRED, the PW will be UP with CW = 1, 
   otherwise the PW will be UP with CW = 0 and the node with CW 
   PREFERRED will automatically degrade to CW not-PREFERRED.

   It is important to note that this control word negotiation mechanism 
   is not interoperable with the old mechanism defined in [RFC4447].

3.4. Option 4: Make CW Capability Mandatory

   This option is to make CW capability mandatory. The PW will only be 
   in operation UP when both PW end-points support control word 
   capability.

   We should consider some side effect while making CW capability 
   mandatory, which will be analyzed in future.

3.5. Extra Considerations

   The possible CW negotiation for multi-segment PW as well as potential 
   complications with FEC129 will be covered in later version of this 
   document.

   Backward compatibility issues will be further discussed in later 
   version of this document.

4. Security Considerations

   This will be added in later version of this document.

5. IANA Considerations

   This will be no IANA request for this document.
