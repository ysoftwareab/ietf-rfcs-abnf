  will ultimately be executed within process space of the
  instantiating application. As such, the application should take
  care to ensure that the driver is valid, and not malicious. Two
  possible means of ensuring a driver's validity are the use of SLP
  protected scopes, or by utilizing signed Java Archives (JAR files)
