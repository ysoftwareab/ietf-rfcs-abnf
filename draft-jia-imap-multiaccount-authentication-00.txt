Internet-Draft   IMAP4 Multi-Account Authentication          June 2011 
        

   Simultaneous authentication for multiple accounts is an attractive 
   feature but is not supported in the current Internet Message Access 
   Protocol [RFC3501]. This document introduces an extension of the 
   Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1). With 
   this extension, when a client is authenticated with one of its 
   account identifiers, it is also authenticated automatically with all 
   the other associated account identifiers (if present), i.e., a client 
   can be authenticated for all of its associated accounts at the same 
   time.

1. Introduction 

   Nowadays, it's quite common for a user to have multiple email 
   accounts. However, according to the current IMAP4rev1 protocol 
   [RFC3501], if a user needs to access an account after he/she has been 
   authenticated for a different one, he/she has to first log out of the 
   current account and then be re-authenticated for the desired account. 
   Thus, a user may find it inconvenient to exchange information among 
   his/her multiple email accounts. For the sake of a better user 
   experience, this document introduces an extension of the IMAP4rev1 
   protocol. With this extension, a user can have multiple email 
   accounts associated with each other. Furthermore, once the user's 
   email client is successfully authenticated with the identifier of one 
   of the user's accounts, the identifiers of the other associated 
   accounts will also be in authenticated states. 

2. Conventions used in this document 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be    
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance. 

3. Specification 

   A user's registration profile SHOULD indicate the association of the 
   user's multiple account identifiers, as requested by the user. 

   During the authentication process initiated by a client's 
   AUTHENTICATE or LOGIN command, the server SHOULD check that client's 
   registration profile to find out whether or not there are any other 
   account identifiers associated with the one provided in the client's 
   authentication request. In the case where the client's registration 
   profile indicates the association of multiple account identifiers, 
   once the client is successfully authenticated with the account 
   identifier provided in the client's authentication request, the 
   client SHOULD also pass the authentication automatically for all 
   those associated account identifiers listed in the registration 
   profile. In one word, a successful authentication for a single 
   account identifier brings all the associated account identifiers into 
   the authenticated states. 

        

4. Security Considerations 

   There are no known security issues with this extension. 

5. IANA Considerations
