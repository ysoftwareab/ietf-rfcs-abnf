 1. Introduction  
     
    In this document we describe a simple protocol for tunneling 
    synchronous data through packet switched networks (PSNs) using 
    pseudowires (PWs) [PWE3-ARCH]. In particular, the protocol herein 
    described may be used to transport T1, E1, T3, and E3 TDM traffic, 
    but completely disregards any structure that may exist in these 
    signals.  
     
    Due to its simplicity, this protocol can be seen as the common 
    denominator of all low-rate TDM PW techniques proposed to date. 
    Its basic unit is the TDM bit, rather than frames or AAL1 cells. 
    Because of its simplicity, STPP is not universally applicable, and 
    more sophisticated transport methods will be required especially 
    under conditions of nontrivial network impairments. In particular, 
    STPP is most suitable for networks where packet loss and packet 
    delay variation are expected to be very low.   
     
    The protocol as herein described is agnostic to the underlying 
    PSN, which may be UDP over IPv4 or IPv6, MPLS, or L2TPv3. 
    Implementation specifics for particular PSNs are discussed in 
    section 3.

 2. STPP Encapsulation 
  
  
    2.1 Layering Model  
    The protocol-layering model used by STPP is shown in the figure, 
    where the order is that of the physical packet, so that higher 
    layers appear lower in the diagram. 
     
       +---------------------------+ 
       | PSN-specific headers      | 
       +---------------------------+ 
       | control word              | 
       +---------------------------+ 
       | payload                   | 
       +---------------------------+ 
     
     
     
    2.2 PSN-specific header 
    The PSN-specific layers contain all necessary infrastructure, and 
    may consist of UDP/IP, MPLS, L2TPv3 over IP, or layer 2 Ethernet. 
    The PSN is assumed to be reliable enough and of sufficient 
    bandwidth to enable transport of the required TDM data.  
     
    STPP edge devices may handle more than one circuit bundle at a 
    time. A circuit bundle is defined as a stream of bits that have 
    originated from a single physical interface or from interfaces 
    that share a common clock, which are transmitted from a single  
    source to a single destination. Circuit bundles are uni-direction 
    streams, but are universally coupled with bundles in the opposite 
    direction to form a bi-directional connection.  
     
    If a STPP edge device is required to handle multiple circuit 
    bundles, then it is the responsibility of the PSN-specific layers 
    to provide a circuit bundle identifier (CBID) in order to enable 
    differentiation between these circuits. These layers will be more 
    fully discussed in section 3. 
     
     
    2.3 STPP Control Word  
    The 32-bit control word MUST appear in every STPP packet. Its 
    format is given in the following figure. 
     
     
     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

 Stein et al.                                                  [PAGE 3]                     Simple TDM Pseudowire Protocol           June 2003   
    RES  (4 bits) Reserved and MUST be set to zero  
     
    L Local Loss of Sync failure (1 bit) The L bit being set indicates 
    that the source has detected or has been informed of a TDM 
    physical layer fault impacting the data to be transmitted. This 
    bit can be used to indicate Physical layer LOS that should trigger 
    AIS generation at the far end. When the L bit is set the contents 
    of the packet may not be meaningful, and the payload size MAY be 
    reduced in order to conserve bandwidth. Once set, if the TDM fault 
    is rectified the L bit MUST be cleared. 
     
    R Remote Receive failure (1 bit) The R bit being set indicates 
    that the source is not receiving packets at its STPP receive port, 
    indicating failure of that direction of the bi-directional 
    connection. This indication can be used to signal congestion or 
    other network related faults. Receiving remote failure indication 
    MAY trigger fall-back mechanisms for congestion avoidance. The R 
    bit MUST be set after a preconfigured number of consecutive 
    packets are not received, and MUST be cleared once packets are 
    once again received. 
     
    Z (2 bits) These bits indicate an extended header format and MUST 
    be set to zero. 
     
    Length (6 bits) is used to indicate the length of the STPP packet 
    (control word and payload), in case padding is employed to meet 
    minimum transmission unit requirements of the PSN. It MUST be used 
    if the total packet length (including PSN, control word, and 
    payload) is less than 64 bytes, and SHOULD be set to zero 
    otherwise. 
     
    Sequence number (16 bits) The STPP sequence number is always 
    present and enables detection of packet loss and misordering. In 
    addition, since the basic clock rate for each circuit bundle is 
    constant, the sequence number may be used as an approximate 
    timestamp. The initial value of the sequence number SHOULD be 
    random (unpredictable) for security purposes, and the value is 
    incremented modulo 2^16 separately for each circuit bundle.

    3.1 UDP/IP 
    For IPv4 the UDP/IP header as described in [UDP] and [IPv4] are 
    prefixed to the STPP data. The STPP packet structure will then be 
    as follows:

    The first five rows are the IP header, the sixth and seventh rows 
    are the UDP header. Row 8 is the STPP control word.  
     
    IPVER (4 bits) is the IP version number, for IPv4 IPVER=4. 
     
    IHL (4 bits) is the length in 32-bit words of the IP header, 
    IHL=5.

    Source IP Address (32 bits) is the IP address of the source. 
     
    Destination IP Address (32 bits) is the IP address of the 
    destination. 
     
    Circuit Bundle ID (16 bits) distinguishes between multiple bundles 
    arriving at the same destination. Bundle numbers in the range from 
    1 to 8063 are available for general use; 0 is invalid; port 
    numbers above 8064 are reserved. 
     
    Destination UDP Port (16 bits) will mark a packet as conforming to 
    STPP. 
     
    UDP Length (16 bits) is the length in octets of UDP header and 
    data. 
     
    UDP Checksum (16 bits) is the checksum of UDP/IP header and data. 
    If not computed it must be set to zero. 
     
     
    3.2 MPLS 
    The MPLS header as described in [MPLS] is prefixed to the STPP 
    data. The packet structure (as seen at the edges) is as follows: 
     
     0                   1                   2                   3

    The first two rows depicted above are the MPLS header; the third 
    is the STPP control word.  
     
    Outer Label (20 bits) is the MPLS label which identifies the MPLS 
    LSP used to tunnel the TDM packets through the MPLS network. It is 
    also known as the tunnel label or the transport label. The label 
    number can be assigned either by manual provisioning or via the 
    MPLS control protocol. While transiting the MPLS network there can 
    be zero, one or more outer label rows. For label stack usage see 
    [MPLS].

    Inner Label (20 bits) the MPLS inner label (also known as the PW 
    label or the interworking label), contains the circuit bundle 
    identifier used to multiplex multiple circuit bundles within the 
    same tunnel. Valid values are as in subsection 3.1 supra. Note 
    that the inner label is always be at the bottom of the MPLS label   
    stack, and hence its stacking bit is set. 
     
     
     
    3.3 L2TPv3 
    If L2TP is used over IPv4 without UDP the L2TPv3 header defined in 
    [L2TPv3] is prefixed to the STPP data.

    Session ID (32 bits) is the locally significant L2TP session 
    identifier, and contains the circuit bundle identifier used to 
    multiplex multiple circuit bundles within the same tunnel. Valid 
    values are as in subsection 3.1 supra. 
     
    Cookie (32 or 64 bits) is an optional field that contains a 
    randomly selected value that can be used to validate association 
    of the received frame with the expected circuit bundle. 
     
     
     
 4. STPP Payload 
     
    STPP payloads are simply contiguous segments of the TDM data. All 
    packets in an STPP flow MUST contain the same number of payload 
    bytes. By constraining the payload size to be a constant for a 
    given flow, a certain resilience to packet loss is attained. When 
    a packet is determined to have been lost, the egress edge device 
    MUST send the proper amount of TDM data to the TDM interface. This 
    ensures that the TDM timing will be maintained, although the TDM 
    data will be corrupted. 
     

  
 Stein et al.                                                  [PAGE 7]                     Simple TDM Pseudowire Protocol           June 2003   
    Arbitrary constant length payloads MAY be placed as-is in the 
    payload field, with no bit or byte alignment implied. Hence no TDM 
    framer is required for use of STPP. 
     
    Specific implementations MAY use TDM framers, and in particular 
    perform bit alignment in order to ensure that the transmitted 
    bytes are TDM bytes. Furthermore, implementations using framers 
    MAY start packets on TDM frame boundaries, and even force packet 
    payloads to contain a TDM frame or multiples thereof. 
     
    In general the size of the STPP payload SHOULD be chosen in order 
    taking delay and efficiency considerations into account. The 
    larger the packet the lower the overhead and hence the higher the 
    efficiency, although the delay will be increased. Hence in 
    situations where delay is required to be minimized (e.g. when echo 
    cancellation can not be employed) short payloads SHOULD be 
    employed. In networks where bandwidth considerations are 
    paramount, or large packets are advisable (e.g. multiuser wireless 
    networks), large payloads SHOULD be chosen. However, payload 
    lengths MUST NOT be chosen so large as to cause packet 
    fragmentation to take place. 
     
    Although STPP packets MAY contain any length payload agreed upon 
    by the sides, every STPP implementation MUST be able to support 
    the following payload sizes for the TDM signals of [G.702]. 
     
      T1  193 bytes (8 consecutive TDM frame times) 
      E1  128 bytes (4 consecutive TDM frame times) 
      E3  537 bytes (1/8000 of the E3 rate) 
      T3  699 bytes (1/8000 of the T3 rate) 
     
    These bizarre default lengths were chosen to facilitate 
    interoperability with implementations that are constrained to 
    transport whole TDM frames. 
     
    In cases where STPP may be required to interwork with AAL1 circuit 
    emulation systems, multiples of 47 bytes SHOULD be used to 
    facilitate this interworking. 
     
     
     
 5. Implementation Issues 
     
    General requirements for transport of TDM over pseudo-wires are 
    detailed in [TDM-REQ]. In the following subsections we review 
    additional aspects essential to successful STPP implementation. 
     
    5.1 Quality of Service 
    STPP does not provide mechanisms to ensure timely delivery or 
    provide other quality-of-service guarantees; hence it is required 
    that the lower-layer services do so. Layer 2 priority can be 
    bestowed upon a STPP stream by using the VLAN priority field, MPLS 
    priority can be provided by using EXP bits, and layer 3 priority 
  
 Stein et al.                                                  [PAGE 8]                     Simple TDM Pseudowire Protocol           June 2003   
    is controllable by using TOS. Switches and routers which the STPP 
    stream must traverse should be configured to respect these 
    priorities. 
     
     
    5.2 Timing 
    Time synchronization is essential for the proper functioning of 
    TDM networks. STPP makes no assurances of conformance to  
    conventional TDM timing standards. It is expected that STPP 
    implementations will use externally derived timing sources. Due to 
    the "serial-bit-stream" nature of STPP payloads, STPP pseudowires
    are highly sensitive to TDM loss of synchronization conditions. 
     
     
    5.3 Packet Delay Variation, Packet Loss, and Packet Misordering 
    In order to compensate for packet delay variation that exists in 
    any IP network a jitter buffer MUST be provided. The length of 
    this buffer SHOULD be configurable and MAY be dynamic (i.e. grow 
    and shrink in length according to the statistics of the delay 
    variation).  
  
    In order to handle infrequent packet loss and misordering a packet 
    order integrity mechanism MUST be provided. This mechanism MUST 
    track the serial numbers of packets in the jitter buffer and MUST 
    take appropriate action when faults are detected. When missing 
    packet(s) are detected the mechanism MUST output interpolation 
    packet(s) in order to retain TDM timing. Packets with incorrect 
    serial numbers or other detectable header errors MAY be discarded. 
    Packets arriving in incorrect order MAY be reordered.  
     
     
     
     
 6. Security Considerations 
     
    STPP does not enhance or detract from the security performance of 
    the underlying PSN, rather it relies upon the PSN's mechanisms for 
    encryption, integrity, and authentication whenever required.  
     
    STPP does not provide protection against malicious users utilizing 
    snooping or packet injection during setup or operation.  
     
    Circuit bundle identifiers SHOULD be selected in an unpredictable 
    manner rather than sequentially or otherwise in order to deter 
    session hijacking. When using L2TP randomly selected cookies MAY 
    be used to validate circuit bundle origin. Sequence numbers SHOULD 
    be randomly initialized in order to increase the difficulty of 
    decrypting based on packet headers.

 7. IANA Considerations 
     
    A UDP protocol identifier will be required for the UDP destination 
    port. Per [PWE3-IANA] a 15-bit PW type will be required for use 
    with MPLS.
