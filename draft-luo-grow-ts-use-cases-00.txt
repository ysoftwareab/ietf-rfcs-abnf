          Use-cases for Traffic Steering in Operator Networks
                     draft-luo-grow-ts-use-cases-00

Abstract

   Transporting data to their users through operators' networks is a
   fundamental service that can benefit both providers and consumers.
   Due to the dramatically increased popularity and desire of
   differentiated services and their constraints, it is essential for
   operators to provide the traffic steering service under limited
   network resources and maximize their benefits at the same time.

   This document lists some typical use cases for traffic steering
   services.  This document does not attempt to enumerate all kinds of
   scenarios, but rather it describes several key features of these
   scenarios from which solutions may be constructed.

Internet-DrafTraffic Steering Use Case in Operator Networks   March 2016


1.  Introduction

   Transporting data to their users through operators' networks is a
   fundamental service that can benefit both providers and consumers.

   Since data/information transport is playing a key role nowadays,
   operators have to face this increasing challenge through satisfying
   services with differentiated criterias, such as latency, throughput,
   reliability and even user-defined constraints.  Kinds of steering
   techniques, either manually or automatically, have been introduced to
   achieve that goal.  Some situations such as fault, utilization and
   also making profit have to be taken care at the same time.

   This document lists some typical use cases for traffic steering
   services.  This document does not attempt to enumerate all kinds of
   scenarios, but rather it describes several key features of these
   scenarios from which solutions may be constructed.

2.  Terminology

   o  QoS: Quality of Service

   o  EoS: Experience of Service

   o  ISP: Internet Service Provider

   o  OTTSP: Over the Top Service Provider

3.  Use-cases for ISP

3.1.  EoS-oriented Steering

   It is a reasonable commercial way to provide multiple paths to the
   same destination with differentiated experiences to prioritized
   users/services.  This is an efficient approach to maximize providers'
   network resources and their profit and give choices to users/
   services.

   Figure 1 EoS-oriented path selection for ISP

   As depicted above, there are three prioritized users in Sydney,
   saying Gold, Silver and Bronze, wish to visit website located in
   HongKong.  An ISP provides three different paths with different
   experiences according to users' priority.  The Gold Users may use
   Path1 with less latency and loss.  The Silver Users may use the Path2
   through Singapore with less latency but maybe some congestion there.
   The Bronze Users may use Path3 through LA with some latency and loss.

3.1.2.  Derived Requirements

   o  REQ01: A classification mechanism/system is REQUIRED to exist to
      identify users' traffic and the correspond priority respectively.

   o  REQ02: A decision procedure/mechanism for path selection is
      REQUIRED to exist to decide traffic forwarding strategy based on
      the input from a classification mechanism.

3.2.  Load Balancing Oriented Steering

   It is a persistent goal for providers to increase the utilization
   ratio of their current network resources.  Through transferring load
   to less preferred links, the throughput of the whole network may be
   increased.

   Figure 2 An Example of Load Balancing between Aggregation and Core

   As depicted above, traffic from Aggregation C to Aggregation D
   follows the path AGG C->Core B->AGG D as the primary path.  It is a
   reasonable practise to transfer some traffic load to less utilized
   path AGG C->Core A->AGG D when the primary path CBD has congestion.

   As depicted above, traffice from Core C to WAN area ususally passes
   through link CA in Core area.  Part of traffice should be transferred
   to link CBA when link CA congested.

   Figure 4 An Example of Load Balancing among ISPs

   As depicted above, traffice from IXP C1 to A usually passes through
   link IXP C1->IXP A2->A.  This is a long distant route, directly
   connect city C and city A.  Part of traffice should be transferred to
   link IXP C1->IXP B1->IXP A1->IXP A2->A when primary link congested.

3.2.4.  An Example for Transit Selection

   It is quite common that multiple paths may exist for the same
   destination at the same time in an ISP network.  Usually those paths
   with better QoS properties such as latency, loss, jitter and etc are
   often preferred.  Since these properties keep changing from time to
   time, the decision of path selection has to be made dynamically.

   Figure 5 An Example for Transit Selection

   As depicted above, the traffic to destination in AS Z1 from ISP IP
   core network (AS C1) has two choices on transit, saying Transit A and
   Transit B.  Transit A will be preferred when the QoS of Transit B
   gets worse.  As a result, the same traffic will go through Transit A
   instead.

   o  REQ08: The three mechanisms above are RECOMMENDED to be automatic
      ones.

4.  Use-cases for OTT

4.1.  QoS-oriented Steering

   Actually similar situation exists in OTT service providers' networks
   too.  An OTTSP may have multiple network exits separated in different
   sites.  Depending on different conditions, it is optional for an
   OTTSP to choose one of those exits to connect with the same ISP.

   Figure 6 QoS-oriented Steering in OTT networks

   As depicted above, the OTTSP has 3 exits with its ISP in City A, City
   B and City C.  Based on network conditions, this OTTSP may choose
   different exits to steer its traffic into ISP's networks.

Internet-DrafTraffic Steering Use Case in Operator Networks   March 2016


4.2.  Business-oriented Steering

   Besides network conditions, an OTTSP may make its steering strategy
   based on different business.  For example, the OTTSP in the graph
   above may choose different exits on per-business base, which REQUIREs
   a mechanism/system exists to identify different businesses from
   traffic flow.

   REQ09: A mechanism/system exists to identify different businesses
   from traffic flow.

4.3.  Inbound Traffic Steering

   Besides exits, an OTTSP may wish to have choices on entrances for
   inbound traffic.  Because of internal policies, an ISP may choose to
   ignore or even prohibit an OTTSP's attempt to affect traffic paths.
   It will be beneficial for both providers if a perfect solution with
