Abstract

    Documents intended to be shared among multiple constituencies must
    share a common format and transport mechanism.  The Incident Object
    Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common XML format for
    document exchange.  This draft outlines the SOAP wrapper for all
    IODEF documents and extensions to facilitate an inter-operable and
    secure communication of documents.  The SOAP wrapper allows for
    flexibility in the selection of a transport protocol.  The
    transport protocols will be provided through existing standards and
    SOAP binding, such as SOAP over HTTP(S) and SOAP over BEEP.

1. Introduction

    The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) [RFCXXX]
    describes an XML document format for the purpose of exchanging data
    between CSIRTS or those responsible for security incident handling
    for network providers.  The defined document format provides an
    easy way for CSIRTS to exchange data in a way which can be easily
    parsed.  In order for the IODEF documents to be shared between
    entities, a uniform method for transport is necessary. SOAP will
    provide a layer of abstraction and enable the use of multiple
    transport protocol bindings.  IODEF documents and extensions will
    be contained in an XML Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID)
    [RFCXXXX] envelope inside the body of a SOAP message.  The
    RIDPolicy class of RID (e.g., policy information that may affect
    message routing) will appear in the SOAP message header. 

    HTTPS or HTTP/TLS has been selected as the REQUIRED SOAP binding
    for exchanging IODEF/RID messages.  The primary reason for
    selecting HTTPS is due to the existence of multiple successful
    implementations of SOAP over HTTP, and it is widely understood.
    Excellent tool support exists to ease the development of
    applications using SOAP over HTTP.  BEEP may actually be better
    suited as a transport for RID messages containing IODEF documents,
    but does not yet have wide adoption.  Standards exist for the HTTPS
    or HTTP/TLS binding for SOAP.  A standard is in development for
    SOAP over BEEP, [RFC****].  Standards MUST be followed when
    implementing transport bindings for RID communications.

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
    this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.



2. SOAP Wrapper

    IODEF/RID documents, including all supported extensions, intended
    to be shared between CSIRTS or NPs MUST use a SOAP wrapper for
    transport along with a supported transport protocol binding.  The
    transport is independent of the wrapper.  SOAP will be used to
    provide the messaging framework and can make distinctions as to how
    messages should be handled by each participating system.  SOAP has
    been selected because of the flexibility it provides for binding
    with transport protocols, which can be independent of the IODEF/RID
    messaging system.

    As defined by the SOAP messaging specifications [18], the IODEF
    document plus any extensions will be in the SOAP body of the
    message.  The SOAP header contains information that is pertinent to
    all participating systems that receive the message, including the
    ultimate destination, any intermediate hosts, and message
    processing policy information.  Depending on the message or


Moriarty & Trammell     Expires: August 20, 2006                [Page 3]
Internet-Draft                                         February 20, 2006


    document being transported, there may be a case, such as with RID
    messages, where a host may only need to view the SOAP header and
    not the SOAP body and is therefore acting as a SOAP intermediary
    node.  An example of this would be if one RID system was sending a
    communication to a RID system for which there was no direct trust
    relationship, an intermediate RID system may be used to provide the
    trusted patch between the communicating systems.  This intermediate
    system may not need to see the contents of the SOAP body.
    Therefore, the elements or classes needed by all participating
    systems MUST be in the SOAP header, specifically the RIDPolicy
    class.  Each participating system receiving an incident handling
    IODEF document is an ultimate destination and has to parse and view
    the entire IODEF document to make necessary decisions.

    The SOAP specifications for intermediate and ultimate nodes MUST be
    followed, for example a message destined for an intermediate node
    would contain the attribute env:role with the value
    http://www.w3c.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/role/next.  Also in
    accordance with the SOAP specifications, the attribute of
    env:mustUnderstand has a value of "true" to ensure each node
    processes the header blocks consistent with the specifications for
    IODEF.

    SOAP messages are typically a one-way conversation. Incident
    information that may be transmitted to another RID host in the form
    of a Report message is the single case within RID where a one way
    communication is specified.  The arrival of an IODEF/RID Report
    document in a SOAP message is simply an assertion that a described
    incident occurred.  In the case of other RID message types to
    support incident handling, two SOAP messages may be exchanged to
    enable bi-directional communication. Request/response pairs defined
    by RID include: TraceRequest/TraceAuthorization/Result,
    Investigation/Result, and IncidentQuery/Report.

3. Transport Protocol Bindings

    The SOAP binding will be used for message transport.  One agreed
    upon protocol, HTTPS, MUST be implemented by all RID systems and
    other protocols may be used.  The use of a single transport binding
    supported by all systems sending and receiving RID messages and
    extensions of IODEF will enable inter-operability between
    participating CSIRTS and NPs.  Other protocol bindings may be
    defined in separate documents.

3.1 SOAP over HTTP/TLS

    SOAP over HTTP/TLS is widely supported, as are ancillary tools such
    as the Web Services Description Language (WSDL), hence the
    selection of SOAP over HTTP 1.1 over TLS as Mandatory for transport
    of RID communications.  Security is provided through the RID
    specification and all REQUIRED RID security MUST be implemented.
    TLS offers additional security at the transport layer; this


Moriarty & Trammell     Expires: August 20, 2006                [Page 4]
Internet-Draft                                         February 20, 2006


    security SHOULD be used.

    BCP 56 contains a number of important considerations when using
    HTTP for application protocols.  These include the size of the
    payload for the application, whether the application will use a web
    browser, whether the protocol should be defined on a port other
    than 80, and if the security provided through HTTPS suits the needs
    of the new application. 

    It is acknowledged within the scope of these concerns that HTTPS is
    not ideally suited for IODEF/RID transport, as the former is a
    client-server protocol and the latter a message-exchange protocol;
    however, the ease of implementation for services based on SOAP over
    HTTP outweighs these concerns. Consistent with BCP 56, IODEF over
    SOAP over HTTP/TLS will require its own TCP port assignment from
    IANA.

    Every RID system participating in a consortium MUST listen for
    HTTPS connections on the assigned port, as the requests and
    responses in a RID message exchange transaction may be
    significantly separated in time. If a RID message is answered
    immediately, or within a generally accepted HTTP client timeout
    (about thirty seconds), the listening system SHOULD return the
    reply message in the HTTP response body; otherwise, it must
    initiate a connection to the requesting system and send its reply
    in an HTTP request.

    If the HTTP response body sent in reply to a RID message does not
    contain a RID message itself, the response body SHOULD be empty,
    and RID clients MUST ignore any response body that is not an
    expected RID message. This provision applies ONLY to HTTP response
    bodies; unsolicited HTTP requests (such as Reports not preceded by
    an IncidentQuery) are handled according to the message exchange
    pattern described in RID.

    RID systems SHOULD use HTTP/1.1 persistent connections as described
    in RFC 2616 to minimize TCP connection setup overhead. RID systems
    SHOULD support chunked transfer encoding on the HTTP server side to
    allow the implementation of clients that do not need to pre-
    calculate message sizes before constructing HTTP headers.

3.2 SOAP over BEEP

    SOAP over BEEP is an optional transport binding for IODEF/RID. A
    RID system supporting BEEP MAY attempt to use SOAP over BEEP on
    first connection with a peer; if the peer does not support SOAP
    over BEEP, the initiating peer MUST fall back to SOAP over HTTPS,
    and SHOULD note that the peer does not support BEEP, to avoid
    attempting to use BEEP in future communications.

    BEEP has certain implementation advantages over HTTP/TLS for this
    application, however the protocol has not been widely implemented.


Moriarty & Trammell     Expires: August 20, 2006                [Page 5]
Internet-Draft                                         February 20, 2006


    Communications between participating RID systems is on a server-to-
    server basis, for which BEEP is better suited than HTTP.   Incident
    handling may at times require immediate action, thus a protocol
    with low overhead and minimum bandwidth requirements is desirable.

    To provide equivalent transport-layer security to HTTP/TLS, the
    BEEP TLS profile MUST be supported and SHOULD be used.

4. Examples

   The examples below, parallel to the examples in section 4.5 of the
   RID document, demonstrate how the structure of RID messages
   fits into SOAP containers as outlined in this document for each
   message type. Of particular note in each is the duplication of the
   RID policy information in both the SOAP header and SOAP body. The
   first example includes the full RID message and associated
   IODEF-Document; following examples omit the IODEF-Document and refer
   to it in a comment. The IODEF-Document must be present, and the
   elements required are outlined in the RID specification.

4.1. Example Trace Request message

   This TraceRequest is identical to the TraceRequest example in
   Section 4.5.1.1 of RID, and would be sent from a CSIRT
   reporting a denial-of-service attack in progress to its upstream
   NP. This request asks the upstream to continue the trace, and to
   rate-limit traffic closer to the source.

5. Security Considerations

    All security considerations of related documents MUST be considered
    including those in the following documents: Requirements for the
    Format for INcident information Exchange (FINE) [RFCXXXX], the
    Incident Data Exchange Format Data Model and XML Implementation
    (IODEF), [RFCXXXX], and Incident Handling: Real-time Inter-network
    Defense (RID) [RFCXXXX].  The SOAP wrappers described herein are
    built upon the foundation of these documents; the security
    considerations contained therein are incorporated by reference.

5.1 Privacy and Confidentiality

    For transport confidentiality, TLS (whether HTTP/TLS or the BEEP


Moriarty & Trammell     Expires: August 20, 2006               [Page 12]
Internet-Draft                                         February 20, 2006


    TLS profile) MUST be supported and SHOULD be used.

    Since multiple bindings for transport may be implemented, RID
    implementations MUST support XML encryption [4] to encrypt the SOAP
    body. Since XML encryption is performed at the IODEF document
    level, not only is the transport encrypted when a document is
    sensitive or contains sensitive elements, but the stored document
    is also encrypted.  Note that this encryption applies only to the
    SOAP body; policy information in the SOAP header should remain
    unencrypted if it is necessary for the intermediate node to
    dispatch the message.   XML encryption protects the IODEF document
    in the SOAP body from being viewed by any involved SOAP
    intermediary node.

5.2 Authentication and Identification

    For transport authentication and identification, TLS (whether
    HTTP/TLS or the BEEP TLS profile) MUST be supported and SHOULD be
    used. Each RID consortium SHOULD use a trusted public key
    infrastructure (PKI) to manage identities for TLS connections.

    Since multiple bindings for transport may be implemented, RID
    implementations MUST support XML digital signatures [5] to
    sign the SOAP body; the rationale and implementation here is
    parallel to that for XML Encryption, in section 5.1 above.

6. IANA Considerations

    The IANA is requested to assign TCP ports for RID over SOAP over
    HTTPS and for RID over SOAP over BEEP.

7. Summary

    SOAP provides the wrapper to facilitate the exchange of RID
    messages.  The IETF and W3C standards provide detailed
    implementation details for SOAP and SOAP protocol bindings.  The
    use of existing standards assists with development and
    interoperability between RID systems exchanging IODEF documents for
    incident handling purposes.  HTTPS is the mandatory transport
    binding for SOAP to be implemented and BEEP is optional.
