Abstract

   This document defines three new DHCP options for delivering
   configuration information to clients of the Novell Directory
   Services. The first option carries a list of NDS servers. The
   second option carries the name of the client's NDS tree. The third
   carries the initial NDS context. These three options provide an NDS
   client with enough information to connect to an NDS tree without
   manual configuration of the client.
  
Changes

   The original draft of this document called for transmitting NDS's
   Unicode text as 16-bit characters in network byte order. The
   current version of the document changes this to have Unicode text
   transformed into octets using UTF-8.
  
1. Introduction

   Novell Directory Services is a distributed, replicated,
   hierarchical database of objects representing network resources

INTERNET-DRAFT         DHCP Options for NDS                  2 July 1997

   such as nodes, services, users, and applications. An NDS client
   must be able to locate an NDS server in order to authenticate
   itself to the network and gain access to the database. In addition,
   the node's user is better served if the NDS client's attention is
   focused on the area of the NDS database likely to be of the most
   interest to the user.
  
   This specification describes DHCP options [1] that carry NDS
   information to TCP/IP clients of NDS. The first option, the NDS
   Servers Option, carries a list of NDS servers. The other two
   options, the NDS Tree Name Option and the NDS Context Option,
   provide the client with a default context within the NDS database.
  
   The NDS Tree Name Option and the NDS Context Option carry 16-bit
   Unicode text encoded into an octet stream using UTF-8 [3]. A
   complete DHCP implementation can represent of the entire Unicode
   character set supported by NDS. At the same time, 7-bit ASCII text
   is unchanged by the UTF-8 transformation. In environments where the
   NDS tree name and context are restricted to the range of 7-bit
   ASCII characters, ASCII-only DHCP clients and servers can support
   these options by using the ASCII text as the UTF-8 encoded data.
  
2. NDS Servers Option

   This option specifies one or more NDS servers for the client to
   contact for access to the NDS database. Servers SHOULD be listed in
   order of preference.
  
   The code for this option is 85. The minimum length of this option
   is 4 octets, and the length MUST be a multiple of 4.
  
      Code   Len        Address 1               Address 2
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
     | 85  |  n  |  a1 |  a2 | a3  |  a4 |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |  ...
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

3. NDS Tree Name Option

   This option specifies the name of the NDS tree the client will be
   contacting. NDS tree names are 16-bit Unicode strings. For
   transmission in the NDS Tree Name Option, an NDS tree name is
   transformed into octets using UTF-8. The string should NOT be zero
   terminated.
  
   The code for this option is 86. The maximum possible length for
   this option is 255 bytes.
  
       Code Len  NDS Tree Name
      +----+----+----+----+----+----+--
      | 86 | n  | c1 | c2 | c3 | c4 |  ...
      +----+----+----+----+----+----+--

4. NDS Context Option

   This option specifies the initial NDS context the client should
   use. NDS contexts are 16-bit Unicode strings. For transmission in
   the NDS Context Option, an NDS context is transformed into octets
   using UTF-8. The string should NOT be zero terminated.
  
   A single DHCP option can only contain 255 octets. Since an NDS
   context name can be longer than that, this option can appear more
   than once in the DHCP packet. The contents of all NDS Context
   options in the packet should be concatenated as suggested in the
   DHCP specification [2, page 24] to get the complete NDS context. Be
   aware that a single UTF-8 encoded character could be split between
   two NDS Context Options.
  
   The code for this option is 87. The maximum length for each
   instance of this option is 255, but, as just described, the option
   may appear more than once if the desired NDS context takes up more
   than 255 octets. Implementations are discouraged from enforcing any
   specific maximum to the final concatenated NDS context.
  
       Code Len  Initial NDS Context
      +----+----+----+----+----+----+--
      | 87 | n  | c1 | c2 | c3 | c4 |  ...
      +----+----+----+----+----+----+--
