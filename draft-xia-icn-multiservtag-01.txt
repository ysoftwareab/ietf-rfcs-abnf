INTERNET DRAFT<the Consideration for the Design of Multi-Service Tag>Oct 31, 2016


1  Introduction

   The document discusses the feasibility of multi-service tag in the
   current internet , analyzes the limitation of the related
   technologies, gives the requirements of the multi-service tag and the
   corresponding use cases.

2  Brief background

   Now the network traffic presents a rapid increase trend, the
   popularization of network video and the diversified viewing model
   modes support watch video in anytime and anywhere,which also results
   in the increase of network traffic. The network video Apps must
   provide terrific Quality of experience(QoE). These trends represent a
   developing direction of future networks. Recognition and handling of
   the application traffic is a key factor for network operation. Each
   network application uses different protocol and is deployed by
   different ISP, which incompletely  depends on the network operaters.
   The method of the recognition of traffic and applications uses the
   fuzzy heuristic modes which are based on the port scope and key
   information of the traffic and are similar with the DPI technology,
   but this series of technologies have some limitations. The heuristic
   methods can't effectively solve the problem of traffic recognition
   because they can't keep up with the synchronization update of
   application characteristics. The traffic recognition schemes based on
   the port scope detection face the great challenge because of enormous
   amount of ports which are discontinuous, especially for http traffic,
   the http traffic usually use 80 or 8080 port, so the content in http
   traffic is difficult to be identified accurately. Due to the
   encryption transmission of more and more traffic, these lead to the
   great increase of DFI/DPI calculated amount and make these two
   technologies be faced with invalidation. IP tunneling technology
   makes the operator's network more complex. So we need a new
   technology which can rapidly and uniquely recognize the traffic based
   on its characteristics without resolve the whole package.


3  The analysis of the limitation of current technologies

   The traffic recognition ways based on IP address pool face
   difficulties. Because IP address is of large amount, dynamic,
   proprietary or private. According to the CDN protocol (RFC 6770), the
   content can be transferred to different CDN and this makes it
   impossible to track the content among different CDN in terms of its
   IP address. Though the traffic recognition based on IP address is
   possible in some scenes, it's impossible to exactly identify every
   flow. Because the same port is maybe repetitively used by different
   application, the traffic recognition based on port may lead the wrong

   results. DFI/DPI may lose efficacy or become very complicated with
   the more and more encrypted traffic in order to analyze the content
   contained by the traffic. A traffic flow of an application will end
   at user terminal through different network routes and this will
   affect the analysis of the traffic flow. There are no unified
   standards for traffic recognition and analysis and it will lead to
   different analysis results for the same traffic flow due to the
   analysis ability and implementation ways. The traffic analysis will
   parse the payload of the packages, thus it will affect the package
   processing efficiency which need extra process, and the ever-
   increasing new protocols also affect the DFI/DPI devices efficiency.
   The flow tag is defined in RFC6437 and it only applies in IPv6
   protocols. The flow tag changes along with the specific traffic flow
   and just like port. The flow tag can't identify the traffic flow
   independently and it must be used with source/destination IP
   addresses together. Because the flow tag is fixed in IPv6 header, it
   can identified easily, but it lacks of protect mechanism and there is
   no mechanism verifying its integrity.

   In general, the current traffic recognition ways is limited in the
   analysis of traffic flows, they can't provide effective feedback
   data, so they can't support the self-adaptive network processing
   capability established by the operators.

3.1 Identifying the content

   In order to improve the hit ratio and actively push the hot resources
   to the local subscribers, the cache system need a succinct way to
   learn the buffered contents and can judge the hot content according
   to the actual content information. 

3.2 Identifying the source

   To enable flexible reverse charging, we need a third party
   recognizable tag of the traffic for the charging GW located between
   the client and server, which helps in recognition of its source and
   billing model, and other features to enable other cultivated
   transport services, e.g. QoS for selected content types for a given
   ICP.

4 Consideration for the design of multi-service tag

   We design a multi-service tag which can help the network better know
   the traffics which it carries. The multi-service tag design abandons
   the traditional fuzzy heuristic design idea and directly include the
   information about the transferred contents and the requirements for
   the transmission network.

   This kind of tag is embedded into the content URL according to some
   rules, it can transparently transferred in different networks and has
   no impact on existing services, and we call it multi-service tag. It
   has the following features:   a) no relationship with IP address or
   port number;

      b) one-to-one correspondence to the transferred content;

      c) stable in a traffic flow lifecycle;

      d) easily obtained and handled by the network operator;

      e) the network can adaptively transfer the content according to
   the tag information;

      f) confidence mechanism against tamper-proofing;

      g) decrease the complexity of network management.

4.1 the preliminary design of multi-service tag

   Here we give a simple and preliminary design of multi-service tag,
   the scheme is not mature and may be changed along with the
   development of the new technologies.

   The format of multi-service tag is as following:

   random code + the content source + the content class + the content
   name + copyright information + other

   random code: it provides the tag identity and the start bit of the
   tag.

   the content source: it indicates the source website of the content.

   the content class: it indicates the classification codes for the
   content which refers to the mainstream Film classification. 

   the content name: it shows the name of the content or the name of the
   live channels.

   copyright information:it indicates the copyright information carried
   by the content.

   For the CP, it can get the standard tag as the above pattern, then
   uses symmetrical encryption for the tag and acquires the final
   transferred tag.

INTERNET DRAFT<the Consideration for the Design of Multi-Service Tag>Oct 31, 2016


   For example, the tag of the film "The Revenant(2015)" is :

   amH6lXSG30||CNTV||Story||The Revenant(2015)||1080P MP4||DRM||

   The cryptographic tag is :

   7tvWwO3L75Zcd9H-1cbCoOJmT5ghBjWG0mPNc7eyY8ZZRQToF9i5heLjLQSbohI7

   After the CP get the cryptographic tag, it can use this tag in the
   URL, as following:

   http://[server-addr]/res/amH6lXSG30&7tvWwO3L75Zcd9H-
   1cbCoOJmT5ghBjWG0mPNc7eyY8ZZRQToF9i5heLjLQSbohI7

4.2 the workflow of multi-service tag in CDN Here is a simple workflow
   for multi-service tag in CDN:

   1.When the new content comes, CP generates the corresponding
   cryptographic tag for the content and store the tag into the database
   with other related information, such as the bandwidth required for
   transmission, target CDN and so on.  

   2.CP generates the corresponding URL with tag and publishes the URL
   to the website.

   3.CP pushes the content, the corresponding URL and related
   information to the CDN and the CDN stores the relevant information
   into its database.

   4.When the uses requests for the content, the CP transmits the uses's
   request URL to the nearest CDN.

   5.The CDN receives the requested URL, identify the feature of the CP
   and sends the CP to the user according to its bandwidth demand.

5  Analysis of application case

5.1  service perception by network

   The Internet video traffic becomes the major service traffic and the
   video traffic has high demands for the transmission network and is
   sensitive to the network. The 4k programs transmission needs more
   than 30Mbps bandwidth, it can't guarantee the QoS even though CDN is
   used for the transmission. The core problem is that the network isn't
   able to know the carried service and thus allocate resources
   dynamically. We can use multi-service tag to resolve the problem.
   Because the tag can contain the information of the carried service,
   the network operator can use tag to quickly identify and handle 4k

INTERNET DRAFT<the Consideration for the Design of Multi-Service Tag>Oct 31, 2016


   program flow and demands to network to allocate resource dynamically
   for the 4k flow.

5.2  intelligent cache

   The cache technology is always one of the main technological means
   for decreasing inter-network settlement charge and enhancing QoE. The
   maximal challenge which the traditional cache technology faces is
   that the repetitive contents waste the cache resource. The core
   technology of the traditional cache is to obtain URL contents and
   store them locally by monitoring the hot program's URLs through DPI.
   But the URL is not stable and the same contents may have different
   URLs. Though we can use DPI to decode the content and acquire partial
   content characteristics to compare, it has major limitations at
   decreasing the repetitive contents and greatly increases the
   computation complexity, what is more, the begin of the content is
   often advertisement or station caption and this makes content
   comparison different to work well. The multi-service tag contains the
   attribute information of carried content which is one-to-one
   correspondence to the content, then the cache system can use the tag
   as the base of comparison so as to quickly discover the repetitive
   contents and raise cache efficiency.


5.3  content exchange between little ISPs

   In order to reduce operating costs, little ISPs are apt to
   interconnect each other to realize the user scale increase and
   resource sharing. Each little ISP has establish its own cache system
   or CDN node in order to decrease the inter-network settlement expense
   with the large ISP. The different little ISP must indicate the
   location of content storage and content itself, then issue the
   content URL. The multi-service tag not only include the information
   of the content and also bound together with the URL to transfer, thus
   resolve the problem of program content sharing after ISP
   interconnection.


6 Simple Demo

   We establish a simple demo to validate the availability of multi-
   service tag, irrespective of security, network complexity and other
   factors. In our demo, we make some simplification for the real
   network components and the network structure is shown in Figure 1.

         Test Terminal ----- bandwidth controller ------ content server

                          Figure 1 Demo network structure

   The content server simulates the CP and CDN, its function
   includes:manages the content, generates the tag and URL, publish the
   URL, response the user request, maintain the content database. The
   content database includes the content tag and its QoE.

   When each new content comes, the content server generates the tag,
   URL, database item for each content. When the user request for a
   content, the content server receives the corresponding URL and finds
   out the database item for it. The content server knows the QoE for
   this content and sends demands to the bandwidth controller for
   resource reservation. we use a H3C S5500 switch as bandwidth
   controller.

   We do a comparison test for the tag. The bandwidth controller
   distributes 10M access bandwidth for each user in default and the
   user asks for a h.264 video of 4K 60P. We make two URLs for this
   video, one URL is without a tag and the other is with a tag. For the
   first time, we can't watch the video smoothly for lack of enough
   bandwidth. For the second time, we can watch the video smoothly.
   Through this demo, the network can identify the feature of the
   traffic through multi-service tag and no need to upgrade the network
   devices, the multi-service can work in current network.
