Internet-Draft                IMAP filters                September 2006


1.  Conventions Used in this Document

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   [[anchor2: Editorial comments and questions are marked like this.]]


2.  Introduction and Overview

   Persistent named searches described in this document allow clients to
   save favourite searches on the server.  Such saved searches can save
   bandwidth for clients that need to regularly repeat them.

   The IMAP extension for persistent named searches is present in any
   IMAP4 implementation which advertises "X-DRAFT-I00-FILTERS"
   [[anchor4: Change upon publication]] as one of the supported
   capabilities in the CAPABILITY command response.


3.  IMAP Protocol Changes

3.1.  Registration of a new server entries

   This document reserves hierarchy of entries under the "/filters" root
   for storing named searches (a.k.a. "filters").  The "value" attribute
   of a "/filters/<filter_name>" server annotation is an IMAP SEARCH
   criteria, conforming to ABNF for the "search-criteria" non-terminal.
   A name of a filter is governed by ABNF for the "filter-name" non-
   terminal.

   [[anchor6: Shared versa private filters might need some discussion.]]

   A new filter named "<filter_name>" can be created (or an existing
   filter can be modified) by storing a non NIL value in the "value"
   attribute of a "/filters/<filter_name>" entry using the SETMETADATA
   [METADATA] command.  A filter can be deleted by storing the NIL value
   in the "value" attribute of the "/filters/<filter_name>" entry.  A
   filter can be renamed by first creating a filter with the new name
   and then deleting filter with the old one.

           C: a SETMETADATA "" "/filters/on-the-road"
               (value.priv "OR SMALLER 5000
                   FROM \"boss@example.com\"")
           S: a OK SETMETADATA complete

3.2.  FILTER SEARCH criterion

   The FILTER criterion for the SEARCH command allows a client to
   reference a filter stored on the server by name.  A filter called
   "<filter_name>" is stored in the server annotation named "/filters/
   <filter_name>" as described in Section 3.1.

   Syntax: FILTER <filter_name>

   When the named filter exist, its search criteria (i.e. the associated
   "value" attribute) is inserted verbatum instead of the FILTER search-
   key.  For example, the following SEARCH command

   C: a SEARCH UID 300:900 FILTER on-the-road SINCE " 3-Dec-2002"

   would be equivalent to the following

   C: a SEARCH UID 300:900 SMALLER 5000 FROM "boss@example.com"
   SINCE " 3-Dec-2002"

   assuming the filter "on-the-road" is as defined in example from
   Section 3.1.

   A reference to a non-existent or unaccessible (e.g. due to access
   control restrictions) filter MUST cause failure of the SEARCH command
   with the tagged NO response.

   [[anchor8: Do we need a new response code for reporting non-existent
   filters?]]

   Note the server SHOULD verify that each search criteria referenced by
   the FILTER search key is a full and correct search criteria.  For
   example, the server should fail the SEARCH command if its SEARCH
   criteria references a filter containing "OR SMALLER" search criteria.

   Note that a named filter itself can reference another filter using
   the FILTER search-key.  Implementations MUST be able to perform at
   least 3 substitution passes on the SEARCH criteria.  If an
   implementation allows for more passes, it MUST implement some kind of
   loop detection.  If an implementation detects a loop or still sees a
   FILTER search-key after performing at least 3 substitutions, it MUST
   behave as if the specified filter doesn't exist (as described above).

4.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].

   Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by
   [RFC3501] or [IMAPABNF].

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

   capability         =/ "X-DRAFT-I00-FILTERS"
                         ;; [[Note to RFC Editor: change the capability
                         name before
                         ;; publication]]

   search-criteria       =  search-key *(SP search-key)

   search-key            =/  "FILTER" SP filter-name
                         ;; New SEARCH criterion for referencing filters

   filter-name           =  1*<any ATOM-CHAR except "/">

                         [[anchor10: Should filter-name be in UTF-8?]]


5.  Security Considerations

   General issues relevant to [RFC3501] (in particular to the SEARCH
   command) and [METADATA] are also relevant to this document.

   Note that excessive use of filters can potentially simplify DoS
   attacks, especially if combined with poor implementations and lack of
   loop detection.  Servers that allow for anonymous access SHOULD NOT
   allow anonymous users to create/edit/delete filters.

   Also note that stored filters can potentially dislose personal
   information about users.  When confidentiality of such information is
   important, clients should use TLS and/or SASL security layer (or
   similar) as recommended in [RFC3501].

   As always, it is important to thoroughly test clients and servers
   implementing this extension.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently located
   at:

      http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities

   This document defines the X-DRAFT-I00-FILTERS [[anchor13: Note to RFC
   Editor: fix before publication]] IMAP capability.  IANA is requested
   to add it to the registry.

   IANA is also requested to add the following entry to the [METADATA]
   registry.

   To:  iana@iana.org

   Subject:  IMAP METADATA Registration

      Please register the following IMAP METADATA item:

      [x] Entry [ ] Attribute

      [ ] Mailbox [x] Server

   Name:  /filters/<filter_name>

   Description:  Defined in RFC XXXX.
