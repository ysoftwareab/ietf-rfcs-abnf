Abstract

    This document serves to register and document the standard MIME types
    associated with the 3GPP multimedia file format, which is part of the
    family based on the ISO Media File Format.


1 Introduction

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet Draft        draft-singer-avt-3gpp-mime-01           Sep 3 2003


    The third-generation partnership project (3GPP) for third-generation
    cellular telephony has defined a standard file format to contain
    audio/visual sequences which may be downloaded to cellular phones
    [3GPP].  At the time of writing, the 3GPP file format (3GP) can
    contain H.263 or MPEG-4 video;  and AMR Narrow-band or AMR wide-band
    speech, or AAC audio;  and 3GPP timed text.

    Within the file, as with all files in the 'ISO' family, there is an
    intrinsic file-type box, which identifies those specifications to
    which the file complies, and which players (possibly compliant with
    only one specification) are permitted by the content author to play
    the file.  This identification is through four-letter 'brands'.
    Files identified by the MIME type defined here MUST contain a brand
    defined in a standard issued by 3GPP that can apply to 3GPP files, in
    their compatible brands list.

    The MIME types defined here are needed correctly to identify such
    files when they are served over HTTP, included in multi-part
    documents, or used in other places where MIME types are used.

2 Security Considerations

    The 3GPP file format may contain audio, video, and displayable text
    data.  There is currently no provision for 'active' elements (such as
    scripts) of any kind.

    Clearly it is possible to author malicious files which attempt to
    call for an excessively large picture size, high sampling-rate audio
    etc.  However, clients can and usually do protect themselves against
    this kind of attack.

    It should be noted that selected metadata fields may encompass
    information partly intended to protect the media against unauthorized
    use or distribution. In this case the intention is that alteration or
    removal of the data in the field would be treated as an offence under
    national agreements based World Intellection Property Organization
    (WIPO) treaties.

    3GPP files have an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically
    possible that metadata fields or media formats could be defined in
    the future which could be used to induce particular actions on the
    part of the recipient, thus presenting additional security risks, but
    this type of capability is currently not supported in the referenced
    specification.

    There is no current provision in the standards for encryption,
    signing, or authentication of these file formats.

3 MIME Types


    This registration applies to all files defined as using the '3GP'
    file format and identified with a suitable brand in a 3GPP
    specification.  The usual file suffix for all these files is ".3gp".

3.1 Files with audio but no video

    The type "audio/3gpp" may be used for files containing audio but no
    visual presentation (neither video nor timed text, for example).

    To: ietf-types@iana.org
    Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type audio/3gpp

MIME media type name:              audio
MIME subtype name:                 3gpp
Required parameters:               none
Optional parameters:               none
Encoding considerations:           files are binary and should be
                                    transmitted in a suitable encoding
                                    without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit
                                    stripping etc.; base64 is a suitable
                                    encoding. Note that this MIME type is
                                    used only for files;  separate types
                                    are used for real-time transfer, such
                                    as for the RTP payload format for AMR
                                    audio [RFC3267].
Security considerations:           see the security considerations
                                    section in RFC XXXX
Interoperability considerations:   The 3GPP organization has defined the
                                    specification, interoperability and
                                    conformance, and conducts regular
                                    interoperability testing.
Published specification:           3GPP 26.234, Release 5;  3GPP 26.244,
                                    Release 6 or later.  3GPP
                                    specifications are publicly
                                    accessible at the 3GPP web site,
                                    www.3gpp.org.
Applications which use this media type: Multi-media
Additional information:            The type "audio/3gpp" MAY be used for
                                    files containing audio but no visual
                                    presentation.  Files served under
                                    this type MUST NOT contain any visual
                                    material.  (Note that 3GPP timed text
                                    is visually presented and is
                                    considered to be visual material).
Magic number(s):                   None.  However, the file-type box

    an audio-only file as "video/3gpp".

                                    stripping etc.; base64 is a suitable
                                    encoding.  Note that this MIME type

                                    types are used for real-time
                                    transfer, such as for the RTP payload
                                    formats for H.263 [RFC2429] and AMR
                                    audio [RFC3267].

4 IANA Considerations

    This document registers the MIME types audio/3gpp and video/3gpp,
    defined above.

5 RFC Editor Considerations

    The references to RFC XXXX in the MIME registrations need to be
    replaced with the actual RFC number when it is issued.
