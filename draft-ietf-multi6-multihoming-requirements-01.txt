Abstract

   Multihoming is an essential component of service for enterprises [3]
   which are part of the Internet.  Existing IPv4 multi-homing
   practices, described in a companion draft [1], provides a set of
   capabilities that must be accommodated by the adopted multi-homing
   architecture in IPv6, and a set of limitations that must be overcome,
   relating in particular to scalability.

   This document outlines a set of requirements for a new IPv6 multi-
   homing architecture.

1. Introduction

   Multihoming is an essential component of service for enterprises
   which are part of the Internet.  Current IPv4 multihoming practices
   have been added on to the CIDR architecture [2], which assumes that
   routing table entries can be aggregated based upon a hierarchy of
   customers and service providers [1].

   However, it appears that this hierarchy is being supplanted by a
   dense mesh of interconnections [9].  Additionally, there has been an
   enormous growth in the number of multihomed organizations.  For
   purposes of redundancy and load sharing, the multihomed customer
   blocks, which are almost always a longer prefix from the provider
   aggregate, are announced, along with the larger aggregate by the
   provider.  This results in rapidly increasing size of the global
   routing table.  This explosion places significant stress on the
   inter-provider routing system.

   Migration to IPv6, which will allow unprecedented scaling of the
   number of potentially multihomed sites, will seriously exacerbate
   this stress unless a substantially different approach to multihoming
   is adopted.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

   An "enterprise" is an entity autonomously operating a network using
   TCP/IP and, in particular, determining the addressing plan and
   address assignments within that network.  This is the definition of
   "enterprise" used in [3].

   A "transit provider" is an enterprise which provides connectivity to
   the Internet to one or more other enterprises.  The connectivity
   provided extends beyond the transit provider's own network.

   A "multi-homed" enterprise is one with more than one transit
   provider.  "Multihoming" is the practice of being multi-homed.

   The term "re-homing" denotes a transition of an enterprise between
   two states of connectedness, due to a change in the connectivity
   between the enterprise and its transit providers.

3. Multihoming Requirements

3.1 Capabilities of IPv4 Multihoming

   The following capabilities of current IPv4 multihoming practices are
   required to be supported by an IPv6 multihoming architecture.  IPv4
   multihoming is discussed in more detail in [1].

3.1.1 Redundancy

   By multihoming, an enterprise should be able to insulate itself from
   certain failure modes within one or more transit providers, as well
   as failures in the network providing interconnecting with one or more
   transit providers.

   The multihoming architecture must accommodate (in the general case,
   issues of shared-fate notwithstanding) the following failure modes:

   o  Physical link failure, such as a fiber cut or router failure,

   o  Logical link failure, such as a misbehaving router interface,

   o  Routing protocol failure, such as a BGP peer reset,

   o  Transit provider failure, such as a backbone-wide IGP failure, and

   o  Exchange failure, such as a BGP reset on an inter-provider
      peering.


3.1.2 Load Sharing

   By multihoming, an enterprise should be able to distribute both
   inbound and outbound traffic between multiple transit providers.

3.1.3 Performance

   By multihoming, an enterprise should be able to protect itself from
   performance difficulties between transit providers.

   For example, suppose enterprise E obtains transit from transit
   providers T1 and T2, and there is long-term congestion between T1 and
   T2.  The multihoming architecture should allow E to ensure that in
   normal operation none of its traffic is carried over the congested
   interconnection T1-T2.

   A multi-homed enterprise must also be able to distribute inbound
   traffic particular multiple transit providers according to the

   particular network within their enterprise which is sourcing or
   sinking the traffic.

3.1.4 Policy

   A customer may choose to multihome for a variety of policy reasons
   outside technical scope (e.g.  cost, acceptable use conditions, etc.)
   For example, customer C homed to ISP A may wish to shift traffic of a
   certain class or application, NNTP, for example, to ISP B as matter
   of policy.  A new IPv6 multihoming proposal must provide support for
   multihoming for external policy reasons.

3.1.5 Simplicity

   As any proposed multihoming solution must be deployed in real
   networks with real customers, simplicity is paramount.  The current
   multihoming solution is quite straightforward to deploy and maintain.
   A new IPv6 multihoming proposal must not be substantially more
   complex to deploy and operate than current IPv4 multihoming
   practices.

3.1.6 Transport-Layer Survivability

   Multihoming solutions must provide re-homing transparency for
   transport-layer protocols; i.e.  exchange of data between devices on
   the multi-homed enterprise network and devices elsewhere on the
   Internet may proceed with no greater interruption than that
   associated with the transient packet loss during the re-homing event.

   New transport-layer sessions must also be able to be created
   following a re-homing event.

3.2 Additional Requirements

3.2.1 Scalability

   Current IPV4 multihoming practices contribute to the significant
   growth currently observed in the state held in the global inter-
   provider routing system; this is a concern both because of the
   hardware requirements it imposes and also because of the impact on
   the stability of the routing system.  This issue is discussed in
   great detail in [9].

   A new IPv6 multihoming architecture should scale to accommodate
   orders of magnitude more multi-homed enterprises without imposing
   unreasonable requirements on the routing system.

3.2.2 Impact on Routers

   The solution may require changes to IPv6 router implementations, but
   these changes must be either minor, or in the form of logically
   separate functions added to existing functions.

   Such changes must not prevent normal single-homed operation, and
   routers implementing these changes must be able to interoperate fully
   with hosts and routers not implementing them.

3.2.3 Impact on Hosts

   The solution must not destroy IPv6 connectivity for a legacy host
   implementing RFC 2373 [5], RFC 2460 [7], RFC 2553 [8] and other basic
   IPv6 specifications current in June 2001.  That is to say, if a host
   can work in a single-homed site, it must still be able to work in a
   multihomed site, even if it cannot benefit from multihoming.

   It would be compatible with this requirement for such a host to lose
   connectivity if the site's primary ISP connection failed.

   If the solution requires changes to the host stack, these changes
   must be either minor, or in the form of logically separate functions
   added to existing functions.

   If the solution requires changes to the socket API and/or the
   transport layer, it must be possible to retain the original socket
   API and transport protocols in parallel, even if they cannot benefit
   from multihoming.

   The multi-homing solution should allow host or application changes to
   enhance session survivability.

3.2.4 Interaction between Hosts and the Routing System

   The solution may involve interaction between a site's hosts and its
   routing system; this interaction should be simple, scaleable and
   securable.

3.2.5 Operations and Management

   It must be posssible to monitor and configure the multihoming system.

4. Security Considerations

   Multihoming no doubt offers some attractive opportunites for denial
   of service and spoofing attacks.  Multihomed sites must be protected
   against such attacks at least as well as single-homed sites.
