Abstract

   This document describes MIME types as per the rules defined in RFC
   2048 [2] for application/SCCP and application/TCAP objects, for use
   in SIP applications. These MIME definitions will be typically used
   in deployments where interworking to the PSTN is required for call
   related and non-call related messages exchanged using services of
   SCCP and TCAP SS7 stack layers.


Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [9].

1. Introduction

   SCCP (Signaling Connection Control Part) and TCAP (Transaction
   Capability Part) are protocols used between SS7 nodes. This
   document describes MIME types for application/SCCP and
   application/TCAP objects for use in SIP applications as per rules
   defined in [2].

   There are scenarios where, while interworking between SS7 and SIP
   networks, not all parameters relevant in SS7 network could be
   interworked onto SIP networks. In such configurations transporting
   SCCP or TCAP encoded signaling information between SIP entities as
   part of the payload of SIP messages would help in realizing next
   generation services using the legacy SS7 infrastructure.

   In SS7 protocol(s) stack, TCAP layer uses services provided by SCCP
   layer. This document however, defines MIME types for use with
   either SCCP or TCAP. By using TCAP MIME directly instead of SCCP
   MIME MAY help implementations save upon processing bandwidth
   provided the parameters in SCCP portion are not important to
   realize the service.

   This is intended to be an IETF approved MIME type, and to be
   defined through an RFC.  NOTE: usage of SCCP or TCAP within SIP is
   neither endorsed nor recommended as a result of this MIME
   registration.


2. Proposed new media types

   SCCP / TCAP messages are composed of binary data that is
   transparent to SIP processing. The best way to encode these is to
   use binary encoding. This is in conformance with the restrictions
   imposed on the use of binary data for MIME (RFC 2045 [4]). It
   should be noted that the rules mentioned in the RFC 2045 apply to
   Internet mail messages and not to SIP  messages. Binary has been
   preferred over Base64 encoding because the latter would only result
   in adding bulk to the encoded messages and possibly be more costly
   in terms of processing power.


2.1 SCCP Media Type

   The application/SCCP media type is defined by the following
   information:

       Media type name: application
       Media subtype name: SCCP
       Required parameters: version

INTERNET-DRAFT                            Expires: September 29, 2005



       Optional parameters: None
       Encoding scheme: binary
       Security considerations: See section 4.

   The SCCP message is encapsulated beginning with the routing label
   parameter in SCCP PDU.

   The 'version' parameter as defined in [7], SHALL be used to
   identify the SCCP protocol version being transported as MIME e.g.
   itu-t 03/93 Q.711.  The string values for version parameter MAY be
   administered on bilateral basis. This specification puts no
   constraints on suitable values that may be used for 'version'
   parameter.

   Content-Disposition header [5] may be included to describe how the
   encapsulated SCCP is to be processed. The rules defined in [7] for
   usage of Content-Disposition header for ISUP MIMEs SHALL be
   followed for SCCP MIME types as well.  

   A sample illustration of Content-Type and Content-Disposition
   header for SCCP MIME object is presented below

      Content-Type: application/SCCP; version=itu-1993
      Content-Disposition: signal; handling=optional


2.2 TCAP Media Type

   The application/TCAP media type is defined by the following
   information:

       Media type name: application
       Media subtype name: TCAP
       Required parameters: version
       Optional parameters: None
       Encoding scheme: binary
       Security considerations: See section 4.

   The TCAP message is encapsulated beginning with the Transaction
   Portion of TCAP PDU.

   The 'version' parameter as defined in [7], SHALL be used to
   identify the TCAP protocol version being transported as MIME e.g.
   itu-t 03/93 Q.771. The string values for version parameter SHALL be
   administered on bilateral basis. This specification puts no
   constraints on suitable values that may be used for 'version'
   parameter.

   Content-Disposition header [5] may be included to describe how the

   encapsulated TCAP is to be processed. The rules defined in [7] for
   usage of Content-Disposition header for ISUP MIME SHALL be followed
   for TCAP MIME types as well.  

   A sample illustration of Content-Type and Content-Disposition
   header for TCAP MIME object is presented below

      Content-Type: application/TCAP; version=itu-1993
      Content-Disposition: signal; handling=optional


3. Illustrative examples

   The sections below illustrates the use of application/SCCP and
   application/TCAP MIME types in SIP messages. The binary portion
   shown in the examples below representing the SCCP or TCAP PDU are
   for illustration purpose only and are not the actual content for
   any SCCP or TCAP message.


3.1 SCCP

   This section illustrates the use of application/SCCP media type in
   a SIP NOTIFY message which has a SPIRITS Event notification [8] and
   an encapsulated SCCP UDT.

   Note that the two payloads are demarcated by the boundary parameter
   (specified in RFC 2046 [1]) which in the example has the value
   "unique-boundary-1". This is part of the specification of MIME
   multipart and is not related to the application/SCCP media type.

       NOTIFY sip:nair@host.example.com SIP/2.0
       From: <sip:11223316@myprovider.com>;tag=asd6302240216
       To: <sip:nair@example.com>;tag=8177-afd-991
       Via: SIP/2.0/UDP notifier.myprovider.com;branch=z9hG4bK9innu7
       Call-ID: 11442233@host.example.com
       Contact: <sip:notifier.myprovider.com>
       CSeq: 200 NOTIFY
       Subscription-State: terminated;reason=fired
       Accept: application/spirits-event+xml
       Event: spirits-INDPs
       Allow-Events: spirits-INDPs, spirits-user-prof
       Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=unique-boundary-1
       Content-Length: ...

       --unique-boundary-1

3.2 TCAP

   This section illustrates the use of application/TCAP media type in
   a SIP NOTIFY message which has a SPIRITS Event notification [8] and
   an encapsulated TCAP continue message.

   Note that the two payloads are demarcated by the boundary parameter
   (specified in RFC 2046 [1]) which in the example has the value
   "unique-boundary-1". This is part of the specification of MIME
   multipart and is not related to the application/TCAP media type.

4. Security considerations

   Information contained in SCCP and TCAP bodies may include sensitive
   customer information, potentially requiring use of encryption.

   Security mechanisms are provided in RFC 3261 [3] (SIP - Session
   Initiation Protocol) should be used as appropriate for both the SIP
   message and the encapsulated SCCP or TCAP body.


5. IANA considerations

   This document registers the "application/SCCP" and
   "application/TCAP" MIME media types.
