                   Where and how to get STDs
                   =========================

The IAB Internet Standards are documented in a small subset of the
RFCs.  Once you know the RFC number of the document describing an
STD you may obtain that document by getting the RFC (see
ways_to_get_rfcs).

For convenience these documents are also grouped and listed by their
STD numbers.

The STDs may be obtained via EMAIL or FTP from STD Repositories.

Many of these repositories also now have World Wide Web servers. Try
the following URL as a starting point:

                http://www.rfc-editor.org


1.  FTP.RFC-EDITOR.ORG

STDs are available via anonymous FTP from FTP.RFC-EDITOR.ORG, with the
pathname: in-notes/std/stdNN.txt (where "NN" is the number of the STD.
For example STD2.TXT is the current Assigned Numbers document.  Login
with FTP username "anonymous" and password "ftp".

STDs can also be obtained via electronic mail from FTP.RFC-EDITOR.ORG
by using the RFC-INFO service.  Address the request to
"rfc-info@rfc-editor.org" with a message body of:

	 Retrieve: STD
	   Doc-ID: STDnnnn

(Where "nnnn" refers to the number of the STD (always use 4 digits, so
STD 2 is STD0002 in the RFC-INFO service).  The RFC-INFO@RFC-EDITOR.ORG
server provides other ways of selecting STDs based on date ranges and
such; for more information send a message to "rfc-info@rfc-editor.org"
with the message body "help: help".

Note that STDs may be very large (greater than 100,000 characters), the
RFC-INFO service will return large documents in sections of less than
50,000 characters each.
