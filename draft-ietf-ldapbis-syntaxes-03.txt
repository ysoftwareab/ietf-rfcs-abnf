Abstract

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [Protocol] provides 
   for exchanging AttributeValue fields in protocol.  This document 
   defines a set of syntaxes for LDAP, rules by which attribute values 
   of these syntaxes are represented in the LDAP protocol, and the 
   matching rules which specify how values are compared.  Also, this 
   document indicates the syntax support requirements on LDAP servers.  
   The syntaxes and matching rules defined in this document are used in 
   schema definition documents to specify attribute types.  


   [Editor's note:  This document is a modified version of parts of 
   RFC 2252 and RFC 2256, in order to bring then up to date.  This 
   action is part of the maintenance activity that is needed in order 
   to progress LDAP (v3) to Draft Standard.  The changes are described 
   in Annex C of this document.  Open items are listed in Annex B.

1.  Overview

   This document defines part of the framework for developing schemas 
   for directories accessible via the Lightweight Directory Access 
   Protocol (LDAP) [Protocol].

   Schema is the collection of attribute type definitions, object class 
   definitions and other information which specify the entries and their
   contents that a server holds.  A server uses schema to determine how 
   to match a filter or attribute value assertion (in a compare 
   operation) against the attributes of an entry, and whether to permit 
   add and modify operations.  This document specifies syntaxes, which 
   are used in defining attribute types, and matching rules.

   Therefore, Section 2 states the general requirements and notation 
   for definition of syntaxes and matching rules.

   Section 3 lists syntaxes and section 4 contains matching rules.

   Additional documents define schemas for representing real-world 
   objects as directory entries.  See [Models], sections 2.4.1 and 2.6 
   and [Schema] for the definitions of user objects and attributes from 
   [X.501], [X.520], and [X.521].


2.  General Issues

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

   This document describes the syntaxes of data conveyed in an 
   Internet protocol.

   Implementors are strongly advised to first read the description of 
   how schema is represented in X.501 [X.501] before reading the rest 
   of this document.

2.1  Notation

   For the purposes of defining attribute syntaxes and matching rules, 
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) is used.  The ABNF productions 
   used in this document are used by other documents in the LDAP set 
   and are listed in [Models].

   The schema definitions provided in this document are line-wrapped 
   for readability.

   In addition, the following ABNF productions are used in this 
   document:

2.2  Syntaxes

   This section defines general requirements for LDAP attribute 


Dally, Legg                  Expires 4 May 2003                 [Page 5]
INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-syntaxes-03      4 November 2002


   syntaxes.  All documents defining attribute syntaxes for use with 
   LDAP are expected to conform to these requirements.  Syntaxes are 
   also defined for matching rules whose assertion value syntax is 
   different from the attribute value syntax.

2.2.1  LDAP-Specific Encodings

   In [Protocol], the encoding of the LDAP protocol is specified.  The 
   protcol encapsulates values of attributes in many places.  In this 
   specification, the encoding of the values is specified, as part of 
   each syntax definition.  These value encoding rules are termed 
   "LDAP-specific encodings".  The LDAP-specific encoding of a value is 
   what is transmitted in the protocol.  

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a given attribute syntax always 
   produces octet-aligned values.  To the greatest extent possible, the 
   LDAP-specific encoding of a value is supposed to be usable for 
   display purposes.  In particular, encoding rules for attribute 
   syntaxes defining non-binary values are supposed to produce strings 
   that can be displayed with little or no translation by clients 
   implementing LDAP.  There are a few cases (e.g., audio) however, 
   when it is not sensible to produce a human-readable representation.  

2.2.2  Syntaxes Implementation Status

   Clients and servers need not implement all the syntaxes listed in 
   section 3, and MAY implement other syntaxes.  

   Clients MUST NOT assume that the LDAP-specific encoding of a value 
   of an unrecognized syntax is a human-readable character string.

   Other documents define additional attribute syntaxes.  However, the 
   definition of additional arbitrary syntaxes is strongly deprecated 
   since it will hinder interoperability.  Today's client and server 
   implementations generally do not have the ability to dynamically 
   recognize new syntaxes.  

2.2.3  Syntax Object Identifiers

   In an LDAP schema, a syntax is named by the Object Identifier (OID) 
   assigned to it.

   Syntaxes that are currently in use in the user schema specification 
   [Schema] and the models specification [Models] are specified in this 
   document in section 3.  The object identifiers assigned to these 
   syntaxes are listed in Annex A.

2.2.4  Syntax Description

   The SyntaxDescription ABNF specified in [Models] is the method used 
   in this document to define the values for each syntax.





Dally, Legg                  Expires 4 May 2003                 [Page 6]
INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-syntaxes-03      4 November 2002


   For example, the syntax description of the INTEGER syntax for whole 
   number values is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27 DESC 'INTEGER' )

2.3  Matching Rules

   The matching rules specified in this document are defined in 
   Section 4.  

   Matching rules are used by servers to compare attribute values 
   against assertion values when performing Search and Compare 
   operations.  They are also used to identify the value to be added 
   or deleted when modifying entries, and are used when comparing a 
   purported distinguished name with the name of an entry.

   Most of the attributes given in the user schema [Schema] have an 
   equality matching rule defined.

...An OID is assigned to a matching rule when it is defined.  A 
   matching rule definition ought not be changed without having a new 
   OID assigned to it.

2.3.1  Matching Rules Implementation Status

   Servers which support matching rules and the extensibleMatch SHOULD 
   implement all the matching rules in section 4.

   Servers MUST publish in the matchingRules attribute, the definitions 
   of matching rules referenced by values of the attributeTypes and 
   matchingRuleUse attributes in the same subschema entry.  Other 
   unreferenced matching rules MAY be published in the matchingRules 
   attribute.  

   If the server supports the extensibleMatch, then the server MAY use 
   the matchingRuleUse attribute to indicate the applicability of 
   selected matching rules to designated attribute types in an 
   extensibleMatch.

2.3.2  Matching Rule Description

   The SyntaxDescription ABNF specified in [Models] is the method used 
   The Matching Rule descriptions are specified according to the 
   MatchingRule ABNF specified in [Models].

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-syntaxes-03      4 November 2002


3.  Syntaxes

3.1  Attribute Type Description

   A value in this syntax is a definition of an attribute type 
   according to the ABNF given [Models].  The LDAP-specific encoding is 
   the character codes in UTF-8 which correspond to the characters in 
   the definition.  

   This syntax is the form in which schema attribute types are 
   published in the directory in a subentry.  The following syntax 
   description gives the OID assigned to this syntax:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.3 DESC 'Attribute Type Description' )

   For example, this is the definition from [User] of the 
   businessCategory attribute type:

   ( 2.5.4.15 NAME 'businessCategory' 
     EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
     SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{128} ) 

   The syntax type for the businessCategory Attribute Type is Directory 
   String.

   This example definition is a value of the Attribute Type Description 
   syntax.  The LDAP-specific encoding of this value is the definition 
   itself.

3.2  Bit String

   A value in this syntax is a value of the BIT STRING data type from 
   ASN.1 [X.680].  The following syntax description gives the OID 
   assigned to this syntax:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.6 DESC 'Bit String' )

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value is the following ABNF:

      bitstring = SQUOTE *binary-digit SQUOTE "B"

      binary-digit = "0" / "1"

   Example:  '0101111101'B

3.3  Boolean

   A value in this syntax is a value of the BOOLEAN data type from 
   ASN.1 [X.680].  That is, there are exactly two values:  one value 
   representing logically true, and the other representing logically 





Dally, Legg                  Expires 4 May 2003                 [Page 8]
INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-syntaxes-03      4 November 2002


   false.  The following syntax description gives the OID assigned to 
   this syntax:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.7 DESC 'Boolean' )

      The LDAP-specific encoding of a value is the following ABNF:

      boolean = "TRUE" / "FALSE"

3.4  Country String

   A value in this syntax is two ASN.1 [X.680] printable string characters 
   representing a country.  The permitted values are as listed in 
   ISO 3166 [ISO3166].  The following syntax description gives the OID 
   assigned to this syntax:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.11 DESC 'Country String' )

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value is the following ABNF:  

      CountryString  = ALPHA ALPHA

      Example:  US

3.5  Delivery Method

   A value in this syntax is a set of the ASN.1 [X.680] enumerated 
   INTEGER values that indicates, in preference order, the service(s) 
   by which the user, represented by the entry, is willing and/or 
   capable of receiving messages.  

   The following syntax description gives the OID assigned to this 
   syntax:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.14 DESC 'Delivery Method' )

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value is the following ABNF:

      delivery-value = pdm / ( WSP pdm SP DOLLAR SP delivery-value )

      pdm = "any" / "mhs" / "physical" / "telex" / "teletex" /
                "g3fax" / "g4fax" / "ia5" / "videotex" / "telephone"

   Example:  telephone $ videotex 

3.6  Directory String

   A value in this syntax is a value of one of the TeletexString, 
   PrintableString or UniversalString data types from ASN.1 [X.680].  
   The minimum length of a Directory String value is one character, that
   is, the string cannot be 'empty'.  The following syntax description 
   gives the OID assigned to this syntax:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 DESC 'Directory String' )


Dally, Legg                  Expires 4 May 2003                 [Page 9]
INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-syntaxes-03      4 November 2002


   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value is the character string itself.

   Note:  The form of DirectoryString is not indicated in protocol.  
   Servers which convert to DAP MUST choose an appropriate form.  
   Servers MUST NOT reject values merely because they contain legal 
   Unicode characters outside of the range of printable ASCII.

   Servers and clients MUST be prepared to receive arbitrary Unicode 
   characters, including characters not presently assigned to any 
   character set.

   Example:  
      This is a string of DirectoryString containing #!%#@.

   For characters in the PrintableString form, the value in the native 
   LDAP encoding is the value itself.

   If the string is in the TeletexString form, then the characters are 
   transliterated to their equivalents in UniversalString, and encoded 
   in UTF-8 [RFC2044].

   If the string is in the UniversalString or BMPString forms [ISO10646], 
   UTF-8 is the LDAP-specific encoding.

3.7  DIT Content Rule Description

   The following syntax description gives the OID assigned to this 
   syntax:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.16 DESC 'DIT Content Rule 
         Description' )

   This syntax is the form in which schema content rules are published 
   in the directory in a subentry.  

   A value in this syntax is a definition of a DIT content rule 
   according to the ABNF in [Models].

   The native LDAP encoding of a value is the character string 
   (DirectoryString) itself.

   Note:  The form of DirectoryString is not indicated in protocol, 
   unless the ;binary option is used (see [Prot]).  Servers which 
   convert to DAP MUST choose an appropriate form.  Servers MUST NOT 
   reject values merely because they contain legal Unicode characters 
   outside of the range of printable ASCII.

   Servers and clients MUST be prepared to receive arbitrary Unicode 
   characters, including characters not presently assigned to any 
   character set.

   Example:  
      This is a string of DirectoryString containing #!%#@.

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-syntaxes-03      4 November 2002


   For characters in the PrintableString form, the value in the native 
   LDAP encoding is the value itself.

   If it is in the TeletexString form, then the characters are 
   transliterated to their equivalents in UniversalString, and encoded 
   in UTF-8 [UTF-8].

   If it is in the UniversalString or BMPString forms [ISO10646], UTF-8 
   is the native LDAP encoding.

3.8  DIT Structure Rule Description

   The following syntax description gives the OID assigned to this 
   syntax:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.17 DESC 'DIT Structure Rule 
         Description' )

   This syntax is the form in which schema structure rules are published
   in the directory in a subentry.  

   A value in the DIT Structure Rule Description syntax is a definition 
   of a schema Structure Rule according to the ABNF in [Models].

   The LDAP-specific encoding is the character codes in UTF-8 [UTF-8] 
   which correspond to the characters in the structure rule definition.

3.9  DN

   A value in the Distinguished Name syntax is a structured set of the 
   ASN.1 [X.680] data types that are included in the DirectoryString 
   syntax.  The following syntax description gives the OID assigned to 
   this syntax:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12 DESC 'DN' )

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value is defined in [LDAPDN].  Note 
   that the LDAP-specific encoding is not reversible to the original BER 
   encoding used in X.500 for Distinguished Names, as the CHOICE of any 
   DirectoryString element in an RDN is not evident in the LDAP-specific 
   encoding..  See the note in section 3.7.

   Examples (from [LDAPDN]):

      CN=Steve Kille,O=Isode Limited,C=GB

      OU=Sales+CN=J. Smith,O=Widget Inc.,C=US

      CN=L. Eagle,O=Sue\, Grabbit and Runn,C=GB

      CN=Before\0DAfter,O=Test,C=GB

      1.1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.0=#04024869,O=Test,C=GB

      SN=Lu\C4\8Di\C4\87

3.10  Enhanced Guide

   A value in the Enhanced Guide syntax is the matching criteria and 
   scope of operation in an Enhanced Filter.  

   The following syntax description gives the OID assigned to this syntax:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.21 DESC 'Enhanced Guide' )

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value is defined by the 
   following ABNF:

      EnhancedGuide = SP oid WSP SHARP WSP criteria WSP SHARP 
                      WSP subset

      subset = "baseobject" / "oneLevel" / "wholeSubtree"

      criteria = or-term / LPAREN or-term RPAREN

      or-term = and-term *( "|" and-term )

      and-term = not-term *( "&" not-term )

      not-term = "!" not-term / 
                 attributetype DOLLAR match-type /
                 LPAREN or-term RPAREN /
                 "?true" / ; 
                 "?false" 

      match-type = "EQ" / "SUBSTR" / "GE" / "LE" / "APPROX"

   The ?true term alternative represents an empty "and" in the Criteria.
   The ?false alternative represents an empty "or" in the Criteria.

   Example:

      person#(sn)#oneLevel

3.11  Facsimile Telephone Number

   A value in the Facsimile Telephone Number syntax is a subscriber

   Implementors, note that the assertion syntax of this matching 
   rule, an OID, is different from the value syntax of attributes for 
   which this is the equality matching rule.

   If the client supplies a filter using an objectIdentifierMatch whose 
   matchValue oid is in the "descr" form, and the oid is not recognized 
   by the server, then the filter is Undefined.

4.17  octetStringMatch

   Servers which implement the extensibleMatch filter SHOULD allow the
   matching rule listed in this section to be used in the
   extensibleMatch.  In general these servers SHOULD allow matching
   rules to be used with all attribute types known to the server, when
   the assertion syntax of the matching rule is the same as the value
   syntax of the attribute.

   The Octet String Match rule compares for equality an asserted octet 
   string with an attribute value of type OCTET STRING.

   The strings match if they are the same length and corresponding 
   octets are identical.

   The following ABNF associates the octetStringMatch rule with 
   the OCTET STRING syntax:  

   ( 2.5.13.17 NAME 'octetStringMatch'

   The following ABNF associates the uniqueMemberMatch rule with the 
   Name and Optional UID syntax:  

      ( 2.5.13.23 NAME 'uniqueMemberMatch'
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.34 )  ; Name And Optional UID

   This matching rule is used to test equality.



5. Security Considerations

5.1  Disclosure

   Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive 
   information about the real-world objects they represent, which can 
   be people, organizations or devices.  Most countries have privacy 
   laws regarding the publication of information about people.

5.2  Security Information Syntaxes

   Several X.500 attributes, such as, the userCertificate attribute, 
   are used to include key-based security information in directory 
   entries.  The attribute syntaxes for these attributes are:  

      Certificate
      CertificateList
      CertificatePair
      SupportedAlgorithm

   These syntaxes are specified for LDAP by the PKIX Working Group, and 
   so, are not included in this document.

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-syntaxes-03      4 November 2002


   The ABNF specifications of "User Certificate", "Authority Revocation 
   List", and "Certificate Pair" in RFC 1778 [RFC1778] are not to 
   be used.

5.3  Securing the Directory

   In order to protect the directory and its contents, strong 
   authentication MUST have been used to identify the Client when an 
   update operation is requested.

          Annex B  Topics Yet To Be Addressed In This Document

   This appendix is provided for informational purposes only, it is not 
   a normative part of this specification.

   APPEARED:  -00
   Paragraph 2.2.3 - Should any syntaxes listed in the table be removed?
   Should any new syntaxes be added?  
   RESOLUTION: Cannot add syntaxes.  Moving the table to an annex keeps 
   a record of the OIDS that have been assigned.  Deleted unspecified 
   syntaxes from the list. APPLIED:  -02

   APPEARED:  -00
   Paragraph 2.2.4 - Should attribute syntaxes be allowed to be referenced
   by a common name, and if so, where should the name come from?  
   RESOLUTION:  Rejected because of adding functionality.  APPLIED:  -01

   APPEARED:  -00
   How does the data model draft <draft-wahl-ladpv3-defns-01.txt> affect
   this draft?  
   RESOLUTION:  It does not.  The draft was preliminary to the revised 
   Schema and Protocol I-Ds.  APPLIED:  -01

   APPEARED:  -00
   Section 3 - Should all listed syntaxes from paragraph 2.2.3 be 
   detailed in this section?  Nearly half the listed syntaxes are not 
   referenced in this section.
   RESOLUTION:  No, because many are not being used, currently.  
   APPLIED:  -01

   APPEARED:  -01
   Section 4 - Should all of the X.520(1993) matching rules be included?  
   In particular, how about caseExactMatch?  Also, should 
   octetStringMatch be moved from updated RFC 2256?
   RESOLUTION:  caseExactMatch not included.  octetStringMatch moved to 
   this document.  APPLIED:  -01

   APPEARED:  -00
   Section 6 - Recognized list of Object classes needs to be reconciled 
   with updated RFC 2256 and the data model draft.
   RESOLUTION:  Not necessary.  APPLIED:  -01

   APPEARED:  -00
   Section 7 - Proper security statement needs to be formulated.
   RESOLUTION:  Text has been expanded since RFC 2252, but needs

      1.  Removed the IESG Note.

      2.  Changed "types" to "syntaxes" in the last sentence of the 
          Abstract.  Also, added to the last sentence in order to 
          indicate that syntaxes are not the only schema elements 
          defined in this document.

      3.  Reorganized the sections so that:

              * the schema element categories are specified in the 
                order in which they build on one another:  syntaxes, 
                matching rules, attributes, object classes

              * within each category the elements are specified in 
                alphbetical order

      4.  Added an "Implementation Status" paragraph for each element, 
          gathering the conformance statements.

      5.  Clarified schema description in the Overview.

      6.  Changed the "Common Encoding Aspects" section title to 
          "Notation" and made corresponding changes throughout the
          document.  The purpose being to relegate all encoding issues
          to the Protocol specification [Protocol].

      7.  Added a MUST statement regarding the syntaxes required of 
          servers.

      8.  Expanded the discussion of each of the syntaxes in section 3.

      9.  Added examples to some of the syntax descriptions.

      10. Added NAME option to the syntax description ABNF 
          in 2.2.4. 

          RESCINDED IN -01!!

      11. Added a note deprecating the UTCTime attribute syntax 
          description in 3.41

      12. In the ABNF of the MatchingRuleDescription in paragraph 2.3.2, 
          replaced "numericoid" with "oid".

      13. In paragraph 2.4.1, replaced the conformance statement about 
          attributes in 2256 with a reference.

      14. Added caseIgnoreIA5Match as the EQUALITY matching rule for 
          the altServer attribute type ABNF in paragraph 5.1.  Note that 
          this could be caseExactIA5Match instead.  SHOULD IT BE??

          RESCINDED IN -01

      15. In paragraphs 5.10 and 5.11, changed "the MODIFY operation" 
          to "LDAP update operations"

      16. Added distinguishedNameMatch as the EQUALITY matching rule 
          for the namingContexts attribute type ABNF in paragraph 5.13.

          RESCINDED IN -01

      17. Reworded paragraph 5.15.

      18. Added distinguishedNameMatch as the EQUALITY matching rule 
          for the namingContexts attribute type ABNF in paragraph 5.13.

          RESCINDED IN -01

      19. Added integerMatch as the EQUALITY and integerOrderingMatch 
          as the Ordering matching rules for the supportedLDAPVersion 
          attribute type ABNF in paragraph 5.18.

          RESCINDED IN -01

      20. Added caseIgnoreMatch as the EQUALITY matching rule for the 
          supportedSASLMechanisms attribute type ABNF in paragraph 5.19. 
          Note that this could be caseExactMatch instead.  SHOULD 
          IT BE??

          RESCINDED IN -01

      21. Made corrections to the ABNF in paragraph 3.12.

      22. Added the seven syntax definitions from RFC 2256 and ordered 
          the definitions alphabetically.

      23. Changed the "Bibliography" section title to "References".

      24. Replaced the X.208 reference with one to X.680(1994), since 
          X.680 is the ASN.1 referred to in the X.500(1993)-series.

      25. Moved the table listing the syntaxes and their oids from 
          paragraph 2.2.3 to a new Annex A.
          
          REMOVED SYNTAXES NOT DEFINED IN THIS I-D FROM THE LIST - 02

      26. Moved the specification of the octetStringMatch matching rule 
          from RFC 2256 to section 4 of this document.

      27. Throughout this I-D, cleaned up whitespace in the ABNF definitions.

      28. In Section 2.1:  
             * Corrected the characters defined in the p rule to match 
               the PrintableString syntax.
             * Deleted the letterstring rule.
             * Modified the utf8 and dstring rules according to a 
               suggestion from K. Zeilenga.
             * Deleted ";" from the keychar rule, which affects the 
               anhstring, keystring, and descr rules.
             * Removed the length option from the numericoid rule

      29. In section 2.2, deleted the sentence about needing a new OID 
          when a syntax is modified.  

      30. In section 2.2, replaced the editor's proposal and subject 
          text with explanation of the LDAP-specific encoding of 
          attribute values.

      31. Removed section 2.2.2 (and renumbered the remainder of 
          section 2.2), leaving the description of binary encoding to 
          the protocol I-D.

-------
-02 changes

      32. Revised specifications to use ABNF [ABNF] instead of BNF 
          throughout the document.

      33. Removed embedded comments from the ABNF productions 
          throughout the document.

      34. Removed the Binary syntax because it was not adequately 
          specified, implementations with different interpretations 
          exist, and it was confused with the ;binary transfer encoding.

      35. Removed the syntaxes, which are not defined in this document, 
          from the list in Annex A.  Consult RFC 2252 for the 
          assignments made previously for syntaxes that have not been 
          defined to date.

      36. Inserted the specification of the octetstring production, from 
          RFC 2234 [ABNF].j

          tags;  split Section 10 into normative and informative 
          subsections.

      39. Deleted the certificate-related syntaxes and noted in the 
          Security Considerations (Section 7) that they are covered 
          in PKIX WG documents.

-03 changes

   40. Removed all discussion of transfer options and the binary option.

   41. Aligned the text to the [MODELS] document.
