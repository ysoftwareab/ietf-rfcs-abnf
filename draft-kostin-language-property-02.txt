Abstract

     (Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is used hereinafter.)
     This document introduces an optional language property which added 
to a character reference in HTML in the following manner: BNF: 
"&<character symbolic name>[,<character language property>];". This 
language property shows what language a referenced character belongs to.

Introduction

     Dear Sirs,

     It seems likely that method of encoding characters in operating 
systems becomes more and more similar to character entity references 
implemented in HTML by notation: BNF: "&<character symbolic name>;" (see 
ref. [1] below) (notation, probably, originated from SGML (for SGML, see 
ref. [3] below)). Especially this process becomes apparent in UTF-8 
sequences. At the days of writing this document the symbolic name is not 
yet become a method of encoding in operating systems. Probably, the way 
of implementing this method inside operating systems lies over prior 
trial in HTML.

     This document introduces a language property (1st step on the way) 
for character reference in HTML. (See ref. [1] below.) This property 
must show what language an encoded character belongs to.

<...> - means that enclosed expression is a definition of some element.
[...] - means that enclosed expression is an optional element.
{...} - means that enclosed expression is repeated 0 (zero) or more
        times.
<ABL> - defines left angle bracket i. e. "<".
<ABL> - defines right angle bracket i. e. ">".
<SBL> - defines left square bracket i. e. "[".
<SBR> - defines right square bracket i. e. "]".

CHAPTER 2 - LANGUAGE PROPERTY FOR CHARACTER REFERENCES


                          CHAPTER 2, DIVISION 1
                        LANGUAGE PROPERTY SYNTAX


(002.001.001.0001 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 1)

     This document introduces an optional language property for 
characters symbolic names, the names by which characters are encoded in 
HTML (see ref. [1] below). The language property is an abbreviated name 
of a language which specifies what a language a character encoded by a 
symbolic name belongs to.

(002.001.001.0002 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 2)

     The language property is added after specified symbolic name 
separated from the symbolic name (or from another character property) by 
a language property separator, a comma (",").

(002.001.001.0003 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 3)

     The language property has a higher priority than the language tag 
described in RFC 3066 (see ref. [5] below and also third example in 
paragraph no. 002.001.001.0005).

(002.001.001.0004 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 4)

     BNF: &<symbolic name>{<separator><other property>}[,<language 
property>]{<separator><other property>};

(002.001.001.0005 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 5)

     Exempli gratia:
"&e,Lat;&x,Lat; &g,Lat;&r,Lat;&a,Lat;&t,Lat;&i,Lat;&a,Lat;" - defines
     Latin expression which, probably, means "for example";
"&p,Serb;&a,Serb;&r,Serb;&k,Serb;" - defines Serbo-Croatian word
     which means "a park";
"&e,Lat;&x; &g;&r;&a;&t;&i;&a; &a,Eng; horse" - defines Latin character
     "e" then defines characters "x gratia " belonging to a default
     language, for example defined by a language tag, and then defines
     English character "a" followed by the word "horse" belonging to a
     default language.

002.001.002 - CHARACTERS USED TO COMPOSE THE LANGUAGE PROPERTY ITSELF


(002.001.002.0001 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 2, paragraph 1)

     The language property, abbreviation of a language name, is composed 
of ASCII characters (for ASCII, see ref. [4] below), excluding:
1. (excluding) ASCII-characters used as character property separators
   (to avoid confusion with the beginning of another character 
   property) (e. g. a comma (",") is a language property separator),
2. (excluding) the "&" ASCII-character
   (used as delimiter of the beginning of another character reference 
   (ref. [1] below)),
3. (excluding) the ";" ASCII-character
   (used as delimiter of the end of the character reference (ref. [1] 
   below)).

(002.001.002.0002 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 2, paragraph 2)

     So list of characters surely allowable for now for composing 
language properties looks as follows:
     A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
     a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -
     and also following characters, just to make sure, (they are ASCII 
too):
     _ (low line) ' (apostrophe)

(002.001.002.0003 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 2, paragraph 3)

     Language properties, abbreviated languages names, syntactically are 
case-sensitive because XML is case-sensitive while semantically they are 
not case-sensitive. E. g. when the "Eng" value have been added to the 
list of values for the language properties (see division 2 about the 
list) it is extremely undesirable to add to the list the "ENG" or the 
"eng" etc. values.

(002.001.002.0004 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 2, paragraph 4)

     There is no restriction on a length of a word for representing the 
language property. The word should be as long (or as short) as enough to 
identify, intuitively, by just reading the word, the language, which 
this word represents. (Simple rule for abbreviating.)

                          CHAPTER 2, DIVISION 2
      ABOUT LIST OF LANGUAGES ABBREVIATIONS FOR LANGUAGE PROPERTY


(002.002.001.0001 - Chapter 2, division 2, section 1, paragraph 1)

     For purposes of guarantee unambiguously to identify a language by 
an actual value of a language property and against possible confusion 
when different languages will specified with the same abbreviation and 
wise versa a list of short words already chosen as values for the 
language properties are maintained. This list is permanently opened for 
free reading, copying, distributing, and adding new language names (the 
last is rather with few restrictions).

(002.002.001.0002 - Chapter 2, division 2, section 1, paragraph 2)

     NOTE: A value added to the list of values for the language 
properties can not be revoked or changed later because otherwise all 
documents prepared with that value may become unreadable. (Please, 
remember it when adding a new value.)

(002.002.001.0003 - Chapter 2, division 2, section 1, paragraph 3)

     Please, take into consideration that this document doesn't contain 
any part of the list of values for the language properties.

properties.
