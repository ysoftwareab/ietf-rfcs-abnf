Abstract

   This document specifies RADIUS [RFC2865] attributes supporting IPv6
   network access to complement [RFC3162] in DHCP environments.  It
   addresses the need to dynamically advertise DNS Server addresses and
   one or multiple IPv6 addresses via DHCPv6.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 RADIUS attributes for DHCP           June 2008


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   This document specifies RADIUS attributes used to support DHCP based
   IPv6 access networks : DNS Server IPv6 address and IPv6 addresses.


3.  Deployment scenario

   The attributes defined in this document are targeted at enhancing the
   IPv6 access deployment scenarios involving DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

   The IPv6-Address attribute is used by a router fulfilling DHCPv6
   Server function for individual addresses when it receives
   configuration information from a RADIUS server, as illustrated in the
   following message sequence.

    Router/Host (DHCPv6 Client)  Router (DHCPv6 Server)  RADIUS Server
       |                           |                                |
       |--Solicit(Address)-------->|                                |
       |                           |-----Request------------------->|
       |                           |<---------Accept(IPv6-Address)--|
       |<-Advertise(Address)-------|                                |
       |---Request(Address)------->|                                |
       |<---Reply(Address)---------|                                |



   This attributes offers an entire IPv6 address to the DHCPv6 Server in
   contrast to Interface-id [RFC3162] that offers only 64 bits.  Even
   concatenated with Framed-IPv6 prefix [RFC3162] to make a 128 bit IPv6
   address, this does not address scenarios where there is a need to
   offer multiple addresses or off-link IPv6 addresses that are not part
   of the prefix stored in the Framed-IPv6-Prefix attribute.  Storing
   the IPv6 address in the subscriber RADIUS profile is particularly
   useful as the Service Provider will know in advance the customers
   uplink IPv6 address, hence facilitating management or security policy
   implementation.

   The IPv6-DNS attribute is used by a router fulfilling DHCPv6 Server
   function for individual addresses when it receives configuration
   information from a RADIUS server, as illustrated in the following

   message sequence.

    Router/Host (DHCPv6 Client)  Router (DHCPv6 Server)    RADIUS Server
        |                            |                                |
        |--Solicit (DNS)------------>|                                |
        |                            |-Request----------------------->|
        |                            |<-------Accept(Ipv6-DNS)--------|
        |<-Advertise(DNS)------------|                                |
        |-Request(DNS)-------------->|                                |
        |<--Reply(DNS)---------------|                                |



   The attributes offer the capability to specify IPv6 DNS Server
   address on a subscriber basis instead of hardcoding the value on the
   DHCP Server on a pool basis.  This is particularly useful in
   wholesale scenarios where the list of DNS Servers to provide depends
   on the subscriber itself.


4.  IPv6-Address Attribute

   This Attribute indicates an IPv6 Address that is assigned to the
   uplink of the user equipment.  This attribute will be mapped to Non-
   temporary Addresses option in DHCPv6.  It MAY be used in Access-
   Accept packets, and can appear multiple times.  It MAY be used in an
   Access-Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the server that it
   would prefer these IPv6 address(es), but the server is not required
   to honor the hint.  Since it is assumed that the NAS, when necessary
   will add a route corresponding to the address, it is not necessary
   for the server to also send a host Framed-IPv6-Route attribute for
   the same address.

   A summary of the IPv6-Address Attribute format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

   [RFC3646].  This attribute MAY be included in both Access-Accept and
   Accounting-Request packets.
