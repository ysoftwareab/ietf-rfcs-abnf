1. Introduction 
 
   The initial effort of PCE WG is focused on solving the path 
   computation problem over domains in MPLS networks. As the same case 
   with MPLS, service providers (SPs) have also come up with 
   requirements for path computation in GMPLS networks such as photonics, 
   TDM-based or Ethernet-based networks as well. 
    
   [PCE-ARCH] and [PCECP-REQ] discuss the framework and requirements for 
   PCE on both packet MPLS networks and (non-packet switch capable) 
   GMPLS networks. This document complements these documents by 
   providing some consideration of GMPLS applications in the inter-
   domain networking environment and indicating a set of requirements 
   for the extended definition of series of PCE related protocols. 
 
   Constraint based shortest path first (CSPF) computation within a 
   domain or over domains for signaling GMPLS Label Switched Paths 
   (LSPs) is more stringent than that of MPLS LSPs [MPLS-AS], because 
   the additional constraints, e.g., interface switching capability, 
   link encoding, link protection capability and so forth need to be 
   considered to establish GMPLS LSPs [CSPF]. GMPLS signaling protocol 
   [RFC3471, RFC3473] is designed taking into account bi-directionality, 
   switching type, encoding type, SRLG, and protection attributes of the 
   TE links spanned by the path, as well as LSP encoding type and 
   switching type for the end points, appropriately. 
 
   This document provides the investigated results of GMPLS applications 
   of PCE especially for the support of GMPLS inter-domain path 
   computation. This document also outlines GMPLS inter-domain 
   architecture, and provides requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE 
   in the GMPLS inter-domain environment.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

3. GMPLS applications of PCE 
    
   3.1 GMPLS network model 
    
   Figure 1 depicts a typical network, consisting of several GMPLS 
   domains, assumed in this document. D1, D2, D3 and D4 have multiple 
   GMPLS inter-domain connections, and D5 has only one GMPLS inter-
   domain connection. These domains follow the definition in [RFC4726].

   Each domain is configured using various switching and link 
   technologies defined in [Arch] and an end-to-end route needs to 
   respect TE link attributes like multiplexing type, encoding type, 
   etc., making the problem a bit different from the case of classical 
   (packet) MPLS. In order to route from one GMPLS domain to another 
   GMPLS domain appropriately, each domain manages traffic engineering 
   database (TED) by PCE, and exchanges or provides route information of 
   paths, while concealing its internal topology information. 
    
   3.2 Path computation in GMPLS network 
    
   [CSPF] describes consideration of GMPLS TE attributes during path 
   computation.  
    
    
             Ingress             Transit             Egress

               Figure 2: Path computation in GMPLS networks. 
    
   For the simplicity in consideration, the below basic assumptions are 
   made when the LSP is created. 
    
       (1) Switching capabilities of outgoing links from the ingress 
           and egress nodes (link1-2 and link4-3 in Figure .) must be 
           consistent with each other. 
       (2) SC of all transit links including incoming links to the 
           ingress and egress nodes (link2-1 and link3-4) should be 
           consistent with switching type of a LSP to be created. 
       (3) Encoding-types of all transit links should be consistent 
           with encoding type of a LSP to be created. 
    
   [CSPF] indicates the possible table of switching capability, encoding 
   type and bandwidth at the ingress link, transiting links and the 
   egress link which need to be satisfied with the created LSP. 
 
 
4. Requirement for GMPLS application of PCE 
 
   In this section, we describe requirements for GMPLS applications of 
   PCE in order to establish GMPLS LSP over domains. 
    
   4.1 PCE requirements

Internet Drafts  draft-otani-pce-GMPLS-req-02.txt             July 2008 
    
    
   As for path computation in GMPLS networks as discussed in section 3, 
   the PCE needs to consider the GMPLS TE attributes appropriately 
   according to tables in [CSPF] once a PCC or another PCE requests a 
   path computation. Indeed, the path calculation request message from 
   the PCC or the PCE needs to contain the information specifying 
   appropriate attributes. Additional attributes to those already 
   defined in [PCECP] are as follows. 
    
   (1) Switching capability: PSC1-4, L2SC, TDM, lambda, LSC, FSC 
   (2) Encoding type: as defined in [RFC4202], [RFC4203], e.g., Ethernet, 
   SONET/SDH, Lambda, etc. 
   (3) e2e Path protection type: as defined in [RFC4872], e.g., 1+1 
   protection, 1:1 protection, (pre-planned) rerouting, etc. 
   (4) Administrative group: as defined in [RFC3630] 
   (5) Link Protection type: as defined in [RFC4203] 
    
   4.2 PCC requirements 
    
   As described above, a PCC needs to support to initiate path 
   computation request specifying abovementioned attributes. Afterwards, 
   GMPLS signaling will be invoked according to the responded messages 
   from the PCE. 
    
   4.3 GMPLS PCE Management 
 
   PCE related Management Information Bases need to consider extensions 
   to be satisfied with requirements for GMPLS applications. For 
   extensions, [GMPLS-TEMIB] are defined to manage TE database and may 
   be referred to accommodate GMPLS TE attributes in the PCE. 
 
 
5. Security consideration 
 
   PCE extensions to support GMPLS should be considered under the same 
   security as current work. This extension will not change the 
   underlying security issues. 
 
 
6. IANA Considerations 
 
   This document has no actions for IANA.
