1.  Introduction

   RFC 7274 [RFC7274] made some changes to the terminology used for MPLS
   Special Purpose Labels, but did not define consistent terminology.

   One thing that RFC 7274 did was to deprecate use of the term
   "reserved labels" when describing a range of labels allocated from a
   registry maintained by IANA.  The term "Reserved" in such a registry
   means "set aside, not to be used", but that range of labels was
   available for allocation according to the policies set out in that
   registry.  The name "Special Purpose Labels" was introduced in RFC
   7274 in place of the previous term, and the abbreviation SPL was
   recommended.

   At the time of writing the first version of this document, the IETF
   was in the process of allocating the very first SPLs from the
   Extended SPL (eSPL) range [RFC8595].  This document discusses and
   recommends terminology and abbreviations to be used when talking
   about and documenting Special Purpose Labels.

   This document updates RFC 3032 [RFC3032] and RFC 7274 [RFC7274] in
   that it changes the terminology for both Base SPLs and Extended SPLs.

2.  Background

   Two sets of SPLs are defined for use in MPLS:

      The range of 0-15, Base Special Purpose Labels (bSPLs), is
      specified in RFC 3032 [RFC3032].

      The range 0-1048575 of eSPLs is specified in RFC 7274 [RFC7274].

      *  the values 0-15 have been reserved never to be allocated

      *  the values 16-239 are available for allocation

      *  the values 240-255 are for experimental use

      *  the values 256-1048575 are currently not available for
         allocation.  A standard track RFC will be needed to allocate
         any labels from this range.

2.1.  GMPLS Special Purpose Labels

   Note that IANA maintains a registry called "Special Purpose
   Generalized Label Values".  Labels in that registry have special
   meaning when present in certain signalling objects, are 32 bits long,
   and are not to be confused with MPLS forwarding plane labels.  This
   document does not make any changes to the GMPLS registry or to how
   labels from that registry are described.

3.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   IANA maintains a name space for 'Special-Purpose Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) Label Values' code points [SPL-NAME-SPACE].  Within
   this name space there are two registries.  One is called the
   'Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values' registry [bSPL].  The other is
   called 'Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values' registry [eSPL].

   The difference in the name of the name space and the first registry
   is only that the MPLS abbreviation is expanded.  This document
   changes the name of the first registry to 'Base Special-Purpose MPLS
   Label Values', but leaves the name of the latter registry unchanged
   as 'Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values'.

   The following conventions will be used in specifications and when
   talking about SPLs

   o  Collectively, the two ranges are known as Special Purpose Labels
      (SPL).

   o  The special purpose labels from the lower range will be called
      Base Special Purpose Labels (bSPL).

   o  The special purpose labels from the higher range will be called
      Extended Special Purpose Labels (eSPL).

   o  The combination of the Extension Label (XL) (value 15 which is a
      bSPL, but that is also called xSPL) and an eSPL is called a
      Composite Special Purpose Label (cSPL).

   This results in a label stacks such as the illustrative examples
   shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

4.  Security Considerations

   The document describes the terminology to be used when describing and
   specifying the use of SPLs.  It does not effect the forwarding in the
   MPLS data plane, nor does it have any effect on how LSPs are
   established by an MPLS control plane or by a centralized controller.

   This document does not aim to describe existing implementations of
   SPLs or potential vulnerabilities of SPLs.

5.  IANA Considerations

   We request that the name of the IANA registry that today is called
   "Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values" is changed to "Base Special-
   Purpose MPLS Label Values".
