1. Abstract 
    
   Automatic Switched Optical Network (ASON) is an network architecture 
   for the introduction of control plane for optical networks. The 
   development and the standardization of ASON have been going on at 
   the ITU-T and its recommendation G.8080 [1]. The control plane 
   architecture introduces a set of reference points between the 
   different architectural components. ASON signaling that runs across 
   those interfaces are described in G.7713 [2]. 
    
   CR-LDP is one of the protocols under consideration at the ITU for 
   the realization of G.7713 and its dynamic connection management. The 
   work specific to CR-LDP extensions for ASON is documented in 
   G.7713.3 (scheduled for consent in January 2003). 
    
   This draft introduces those CR-LDP extensions that are specific to 
   ASON. This draft should be considered in junction with RFC 3036 [3], 
   RFC 3212 [4], and RFC (CR-LDP extensions for GMPLS) [5].  
    
    
2. Overview of CR-LDP Extensions for ASON

   In addition to the CR-LDP GMPLS extensions [5], this draft describes 
   ASON specific CR-LDP extensions covering the following ASON 
   signaling requirements: 
    
   - Call and connection control separation 
   - Support of soft permanent connections (SPC) 
   - Crankback 
   - Additional error codes 
    
   An important ASON architectural principle is the separation between 
   the call and the connection controller as described in G.8080. Call 
   and connection control separation allows for a call with multiple 
   connections associated to it. It also allows for a call with no 
   connections (a temporary situation that might be useful during 
   recovery). 
    
   There are two models to achieve this separation. The first model is 
   a one where the call set up request is always accompanied by a 
   connection request. The second model is the one in which call set up 
   is done independent from connection set up. The first model is 
   usually referred to as logical separation, while the second model is 
   usually referred to as complete separation. CR-LDP extensions for 
   ASON support the two separation models. 
    
   Two new messages are introduced for call operations (set up and 
   release). The Call Setup message is used for those cases where 
   complete separation is required. Otherwise the LDP Label Request 
   message is used for logical separation. 
    
   Connection set up request must indicate the call to which the 
   connection needs to be associated to. A Call ID TLV is introduced to 
   achieve this goal. The structure of the Call ID allows it to have a 
   global or an operator scope. 
    
   Call release is always achieved using Call Release message. The 
   reception of the call Release messages signifies the intention to 
   remove all connections that are associated to the call. Connection 
   release is achieved using the same CR-LDP label release procedure 
   (using LDP Label Release and Label Withdraw messages). 
    
   A Call Capability TLV is also introduced to explicitly indicate the 
   capability of the requested call. 
    
   An SPC service assumes that both source and destination user-to-
   network connection segments are provisioned while the network 
   connection segment is set up via control plane. For example when the 
   initial request is received from an external source, e.g. from a 
   management system, there is an implicit assumption that the control 
   plane has adequate information to determine the specific destination 
   (network-to-user) link connection to use. Support for CR-LDP is 
   provided by the use of the Egress Label TLV as defined in OIF UNI 
   1.0 [6] and [7].

3. CR-LDP Messages for ASON 
    
   This section describes the formats and the procedures of the two 
   messages that are required for ASON call and connection control 
   separation. Those messages are the Call Setup messages and the Call 
   Release message. 
    
3.1 Call Setup Message 
    
   The format of the Call Setup message is: 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

3.1.2 Call Setup Procedure  
 
        
   The Calling party sends the Call Setup message whenever a new call 
   needs to be set up with no connection associated to it. The Call 
   Setup message SHALL contain all the information required by the

   network to process the call. In Particular the Call Setup message 
   shall include the calling and called party addresses as specified by 
   the Source ID and Dest ID TLV. The setup message MUST include Call 
   ID TLV. The call control entity shall identify the call using the 
   selected identifier for the lifetime of the call. The Call Setup 
   message shall progress through the network to the called party. The 
   called party may accept or reject the incoming call. An LDP 
   Notification message with the appropriate status code shall be used 
   to inform the calling party whether the setup is successful. The 
   call can be rejected by either the network, e.g. for policy reasons, 
   or by the called party.  
    
3.2 The Call Release Message 
    
   This format of the Call Release message is: 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

3.2.1 Call Release Procedure:  
    
   The Call Release message is sent by any entity of the network to 
   indicate the desire to terminate an already established call. The 
   Call Release message MUST include the Call ID TLV of the call to be 
   terminated. Confirmation of call release is indicated to the request 
   initiator using a Notification message with the appropriate status 
   code. Reception and processing of the Call Release message MUST 
   trigger the release of all connections that are associated to that 
   call. Connection release follows the normal CR-LDP procedure using 
   Label Release and Label Withdraw messages.  
    
    
4. CR-LDP TLV for ASON 
    
   This section describes the Call ID TLV and the Call Capability TLV 
   introduced for ASON. 
    
4.1 Call ID TLV 
  
O. Aboul-Magd     Informational- Expires: March 2003                 4

   An established call may be identified by a Call ID. The Call ID is a 
   globally unique identifier that is set by the source network. The 
   structure for the Call ID (to guarantee global uniqueness) is to 
   concatenate a globally unique fixed identifier (composed of country 
   code, carrier code, unique access point code) with an operator 
   specific identifier (where the operator specific identifier is 
   composed of a source transport network element address and a local 
   Identifier).  
    
   Therefore, a generic CALL_ID with global uniqueness includes <global 
   Id> (composed of <country code> plus <carrier code> plus <unique 
   access point code>) and <operator specific Id> (composed of <source 
   transport network element address> plus <local Identifier>). For a 
   CALL_ID that only requires operator specific uniqueness only the 
   <operator specific Id> is needed, while for a CALL_ID that requires 
   to be globally unique both <global ID> and <operator specific Id> 
   are needed. 
    
   The <global Id> shall consist of a three-character International 
   Segment (the <country code>) and a twelve-character National Segment 
   (the <carrier code> plus <unique access point code>). These 
   characters shall be coded according to ITU-T Recommendation T.50. 
   The International Segment (IS) field provides a 3 character ISO 3166 
   Geographic/Political Country Code. The country code shall be based 
   on the three-character uppercase alphabetic ISO 3166 Country Code 
   (e.g., USA, FRA).  
    
   The National Segment (NS) field consists of two sub-fields: the ITU 
   Carrier Code followed by a Unique Access Point Code. The ITU Carrier 
   Code is a code assigned to a network operator/service provider, 
   maintained by the ITU-T Telecommunication Service Bureau in 
   association with Recommendation M.1400. This code shall consist of 
   1-6 left-justified characters, alphabetic, or leading alphabetic 
   with trailing numeric. The unique access point code shall be a 
   matter for the organization to which the country code and ITU 
   carrier code have been assigned, provided that uniqueness is 
   guaranteed. This code shall consist of 6-11 characters, with 
   trailing NULL, completing the 12-character National Segment. 
     
   The format of the operator specific (Op-Sp) CALL_ID TLV: 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3  
    
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   STEA Sub TLV: 
        The Source Transport Element Address is an address of the 
        transport network element (SSN) controlled by the source 
        network. Its length can be 4, 6, 16, or 20 byte long. The STEA 
        Sub TLV is TLV Type 1. 
         
   Local Identifier: 
        A 64-bit identifier that remains constant over the life of the 
        call.

   International Segment (IS): 
        To be coded according to ITU-T recommendation T.50. It provides 
        a 3 character uppercase country code, e.g. USA, FRA, etc. 
         
   National Segment (NS): 
        NS consists of two fields, the ITU carrier Code followed by a 
        Unique Access Point Code. 
         
    
4.1.1 Call ID Procedure 
    
   The following processing rules are applicable to the CALL ID TLV: 
    
   - For initial calls, the calling/originating party call controller 
     must set the CALL ID values to all-zeros 
   - For a new call request, the source networks call controller (SNCC) 
     sets the appropriate type and value for the CALL ID. 
   - For an existing call (in case Call ID is non zero) the SNCC 
     verifies existence of the call 
   - The Call ID TLV on all messages MUST be sent from ingress call 
     controller to egress call controller by all other intermediate 
     controlling without altering. 
   - The destination user/client receiving the request uses the CALL ID 
     values as reference to the requested call between the source user 
     and itself. Subsequent actions related to the call uses the CALL 
     ID as the reference identifier.

4.2 Call Capability TLV 
    
   The format of the Call Capability TLV is: 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3  
    
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1  
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
      |U|F| Call Capabaility(TBD)     |      Length                   |  
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |                       Call Capability                         |   
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
    
   The Call Capability TLV is used to explicitly indicate the 
   configuration potentiality of the call. 
    
4.3 Crankback TLV 
    
   Crankback requires that when the Label Request message is blocked at  
   a particular node due to unavailable resources, the node will inform 
   the initiator of the Label Request message of the location of the 
   blockage. The initiator can then re-compute new explicit routes that 
   avoid the area where resource shortage is detected. A new Label 
   Request message is sent that includes the new route.  
        
   The support of crankback in CR-LDP is facilitated by the 
   introduction of a Crankback TLV. An LDP Notification message is used 
   to inform the Label Request message initiator of the blocking 
   condition. The Notification message includes the Crankback TLV that 
   indicates the location of resource shortage. The location of the 
   resource shortage is identified using the ER-HOP TLV. The encoding 
   of the Crankbck TLV is:  
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |                       ER-HOP TLV                              |

6. IANA Consideration 
    
   This draft uses the LDP RFC 3036 [3] name spaces; see 
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ldp-namespaces, which require 
   assignment for the following messages: 
    
   Call Setup 
   Call Release 
    
   The assignment for the following TLVs 

   Op-Sp Call ID TLV 
   GU Call ID TLV 
   Call Capability TLV 
   Crankback TLV 
    
   In addition to those TLVs described here, G.7713.3 requires a code 
   point for the Link Feedback TLV as described in "draft-ietf-mpls-te-
   feed-05.txt" 
    
    
   The assignment for the new error codes as listed in section 5 of 
   this draft.
