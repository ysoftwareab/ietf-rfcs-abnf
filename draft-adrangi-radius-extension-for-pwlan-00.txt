   Abstract 

      This document describes additional Remote Authentication Dial In 
      User Service (RADIUS) [1] attributes for use of RADIUS AAA 
      (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) in Public Wireless 
      Local Area Network (PWLAN) deployments.  Some of these attributes 
      are already implemented as Vendor Specific Attributes (VSA) in 
      networks today, but are core to PWLAN interoperability and 
      roaming.

   1. Introduction  
    
    Wireless LAN (WLAN) Access Networks (AN) are being deployed in 
    public places such as airports, hotels, shopping malls, and coffee 
    shops by a diverse set of incumbent operators like cellular 
    carriers (GSM and CDMA), Wireless Internet Service Providers 
    (WISP), and fixed broadband operators.    
     
    Remote Access Dial In User Service (RADIUS) [1],[2],[3] is the 
    dominant Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) 
    protocol in use across broadband networks globally and consequently 
    will be heavily reused in Public WLAN (PWLAN) deployments.  
     
    This document describes a number of additional attributes that are 
    needed to enable use of RADIUS AAA in PWLANs in an interoperable 
    manner.  Attributes described in this document includes some of 
    Vendor Specific Attributes (VSA) that are recommended by various 
    standard bodies (such as 3GPP, 3GPP2, GSMA) for PWLAN interworking. 
    Common understanding and Standardization of these attributes is 
    essential to enable improved interoperability and hence successful 
    deployments of PWLANs. 

   1.2 Applicability 
    
      Although proposed attributes in this draft are intended for PWLAN 
      deployments, they can also be used in other networks (e.g., wired 
      networks).

   1.3 Requirements language 

      In this document, several words are used to signify the 
      requirements of the specification.  These words are often 
      capitalized.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
      "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", 
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as 
      described in [RFC2119]. 
    
   1.4 Terminology 
    
      Access Network (AN) 
          The PWLAN hotspot network that provides wireless connectivity 
          to the Internet for WLAN clients (or stations) present in the 
          local access area. This MAY be in a separate security and 
          routing domain with respect to the Home Service Network or a 
          Mediating Network. 
       
      Home Service Network (HSN) 
          The network providing the service and therefore maintaining 
          the direct relationship to the user/subscriber of the WLAN 
          service. All AAA functions are ultimately performed by the 
          HSN. 
    
    
      Access Point (AP) 
         ôA station that provides access to the distribution services 
         via the wireless medium for associated Stations.ö 
    
      RADIUS server 
         ôThis is a server which provides for 
         authentication/authorization via the protocol described in 
         [1], and for accounting as described in [6].ö  It is deployed 
         in the PWLAN AN, MN, and HSN. 

   2. Operation 

     Operation is identical to that defined in [1] and [2]. 

   2.1 RADIUS Support for PWLAN Location Information 
    
      Rationale  
    
        When a PWLAN client connects to a PWLAN AN, the information 
        pertaining to the PWLAN AN location and operational ownership 
        needs to be conveyed to the HSN for accounting and services 
        management purposes. This information contains the AN operator 
        name and the AN location information such as Location Name, 
        Location Type, City, State, and Country.  This information 
        enables use case scenarios for location aware billing, location 
        aware subscriber authentication / authorization in roaming, and 
        location aware services.

      Attribute 
    
        This attribute describes information pertaining to a PWLAN AN 
        location and operational ownership.  It MUST be sent in Access-
        Request, and Accounting-Request records where the Acc-Status-
        Type is set to Start or Stop if available.

        Here is a list of field name and description of their values 
        defined in this document.  The field names are not case 
        sensitive. 
     
        Operator-Name : It contains a PWLAN AN operator name which MUST 
        be a globally known and registered name.  One proposal is to 
        structure the content of the field into two parts separated by 
        a colon.  The first (also referred to as a prefix) identifies 
        the operator type; example: GSM, WISP.  And, the second part 
        identifies a globally known operator defined within the domain 
        of the operator type û for example, GSM:xxxx where xxxx is a 
        unique globally known GSM operator ID. Prefixes describing 
        various operator types MUST be registered with IANA [6].  The 
        other proposal is to have a prefixed field name where the 
        prefix identifies the operator type (e.g., GSM:Operator-Name, 
        WISP:Operator-Name). 
         
        Location-ID : It contains a PWLAN AN location ID defined within 
        the scope of the AN operator name. 
    
        Location-name : It contains a PWLAN AN location name defined 
        within the scope of the AN operator name (e.g., starbucks_2) 
         
        Location-type : It contains a PWLAN AN location type defined 
        within the scope of the AN operator (e.g., coffee-shop, 
        airport)     
         
        City : It contains a city name where an PWLAN AN is located 
        (e.g., Portland) 
                        
        State : It contains a state name where an PWLAN AN is located 
        (e.g., Oregon) 
         
        Country : It contains an ISO (International Organization for 
        Standardization) defined country name where an PWLAN AN is 
        located (e.g., USA).   
    
        Example: 
         
        Operator-name=GSM:T-Mobile, location-ID=44,location-
        name=starbucks-4,location-type=coffee shop, city= seattle, 
        state=Washington,country=us 
    
   2.2 RADIUS Support for Advertising Application-based capabilities  
    
      Rationale 
    
        There  is  a  need  for  a  HSN  RADIUS  server  to  discover 
        capabilities of a RADIUS client that has initiated a connection 
        to it.  The capabilities indicate standard-based applications 
        (e.g., existing dynamic authorization Extension to Remote [5], 
        future prepaid accounting model, etc.) that a PWLAN AN RADIUS

        Client supports.  This enables the HSN RADIUS server to decide 
        which application services it can use for the connection, or 
        whether or not it should accept the connection.  For example, 
        if the subscriber is a prepaid subscriber, and the RADIUS 
        client does not support the prepaid capability, the RADIUS 
        server may want to reject the connection.   
         
        Having a standard method for advertising application-based 
        capabilities  is  essential  for  interoperability  and  proper 
        operation of RADIUS for PWLAN in roaming situations. 

      Attribute 
    
        This attribute describes standard-based Applications (also 
        referred to as capabilities) that a PWLAN AN AP supports.  
        These capabilities MUST be identified by their identity numbers 
        assigned by the appropriate standard bodies (e.g., RFC number 
        for IETF).  This attribute MUST be sent in Access-Request if 
        available. 

        A summary of the capability Attribute is shown below.

        String 
         
           The string field is one or more octets.  This string 
           consists of a comma-delimited list of URIs. These URIs may 
           but do not necessarily correspond to the actual locations of 
           files. However, they must include a FQDN corresponding to 
           the organization responsible for the document or standard to 
           which compliance is claimed.  For example: 
            
           www.ietf.org/rfc/3580;2548;2607, www.3GPP.org/Release6.

           Note  that  conformance  to  one  specification  may  imply 
           conformance to others as well.  Thus, it is not necessary or 
           even possible to list all standards that the PWLAN AN 
           supports.    In  many  cases,  the  referenced  URIs  will 
           correspond  to  best  practices  documents  that  reference 
           standards and also indicate which optional elements of those 
           standards must be implemented.   
      
    
   2.3 RADIUS Support for Specifying a Mobile IP Home Agent  

      Rationale 
    
        In Mobile IP [7], a Mobile-IP enabled client registers with its 
        home agent when it attaches to the network for the first time, 
        or when it changes its network point of attachment.  In typical 
        service  provider  deployments,  networks  are  geographically 
        dispersed within a single large administrative domain.  In such 
        networks, it is possible to deploy the home agents in each 
        geographical area.  When a PWLAN client authenticates to its 
        HSN RADIUS server through a PWLAN AN, the HSN RADIUS server may 
        want to specify the optimal home agent for that PWLAN client 
        based on the PWLAN AN location information.   

        There is a need for an interoperable method by which the home 
        RADIUS server can indicate the Mobile IP home agent that should 
        used by the PWLAN client to the RADIUS client.  Note that the 
        home agent can later be indicated to the PWLAN client through a 
        specific means û for example, it can be relayed in the ôhome 
        agent addressö field of a DHCP reply if the client acquires its 
        IP address through DHCP [8]. 
    
      Attribute (IPv4 version) 
    
        This attribute indicates the home agent IPv4 Address that can 
        be used by a Mobile-IP enabled PWLAN client.  This attribute 
        SHOULD be sent in Access-Accept if available. 
         
         
        A summary of the Mobile IPv4 home agent Attribute is shown 
        below.

   2.4 RADIUS Support for Specifying DNS Server 
    
      Rationale 
    
        Once a PWLAN client authenticated, it will most likely acquire 
        an IP address by sending a Request to a DHCP [8] server in the 
        PWLAN AN.  The DHCP server allocates an IP address and sends it 
        to the PWLAN client in a DHCP reply.  The DHCP server also has 
        an option of sending a DNS update to the DNS server specified 
        by the HSN.   
         
        There is a need for an interoperable method by which a HSN 
        RADIUS server can indicate the DNS server to the RADIUS client 
        for a given PWLAN client. 
    
      Attribute (IPv4 Version) 
    
        This attribute indicates IPv4 address of a DNS server that 
        should be used for a PWLAN client, most likely by a DHCP 
        server.  This attribute SHOULD be sent in Access-Accept if 
        available. 

        A summary of the DNS Server IPv4 Address Attribute is shown 
        below.

   2.5 RADIUS Support for Specifying Remote IP Addresses 

      Rationale 
    
        A HSN RADIUS server may want to restrict its subscribers 
        accessing to certain remote IP addresses for different types of 
        servers  (such  as,  web  servers,  multimedia  servers,  mail 
        servers, etc.) based on their subscription profiles.  Or, a HSN 
        RADIUS server may want to monitor a range of remote IP address 
        that its subscribers may connect to for accounting purposes. 
        There is a need for an interoperable method by which one or 
        more remote IP address associated with various services can be 
        indicated to the RADIUS client for a given PWLAN Client for 
        access authorization and/or accounting purposes. 

      Attribute (IPv4 Version) 
    
        This attribute indicates an IPv4 address and address mask which 
        together identify one or more IPv4 address.  It SHOULD be sent 
        in Access-Accept, and Accounting-Request records where the Acc-
        Status-Type is set to Start or Stop.

      Attribute (IPv6 Version) 

           To Be Defined 

   2.6 RADIUS Support for Specifying IP Address Type Options 
    
      Rationale 
    
        A PWLAN AN may have an option of assigning a layer 3 public 
        (i.e., routable) or private (i.e., non-routable) address to a 
        PWLAN client.  If the option is available, a HSN may also want 
        to influence which address type (i.e., public or private) 
        should be assigned to the PWLAN client depending on the 
        clientÆs subscription profile.  
         
        There is a need for an interoperable method by which 1) a PWLAN 
        AN can indicate the IP address type options to a HSN. 2) A HSN 
        can specify the desired IP address type.

      Attribute 
    
        This attribute indicates IPv4 address type options. It can be 
        present  in  Access-Request,  Access-Accept,  and  Accounting-
        Request records where the Acc-Status-Type is set to Start or 
        Stop if available.  When it is used in an Access-Accept and 
        Accounting-Request packets, the Address Type value MUST be 1 or 
        2.   
         
        A PWLAN AN includes this attribute to advertise its IP address 
        type options for a given PWLAN client. A RADIUS server includes 
        this attribute in the Access-Accept to specify an IP address 
        type option for the PWLAN client.  
         
        A RADIUS server MUST NOT include this attribute in the Access-
        Accept if the IP Address Type options were not advertised in 
        the Access-Request.  If an invalid IP Address Type option is 
        received in the Access-Accept, then the PWLAN AN MUST use its 
        default  IP  Address  Type  option  for  the  PWLAN  client.  
        Otherwise, the PWLAN AN MUST assign an IP address according to 
        the specified type option, and it MUST include this attribute 
        in Accounting-Request packets to indicate the used IP address 
        type option.  If an IP address type option is not specified in 
        the Access-Accept, the PWLAN AN MUST NOT include this attribute 
        in Accounting-Request packets.

   2.7 RADIUS Support for Specifying Network Capabilities 
                                                       
      Rationale 
    
        When a PWLAN client connects to a PWLAN AN, it may use certain 
        services (e.g., real-time or multimedia services) that require 
        a minimum network resources for the desired Quality of Service 
        (QoS) and user experience.  A PWLAN AN may be able to allocate 
        network resources (e.g., radio and wired network bandwidth, 
        radio network delays) for a PWLAN client within the AN, or 
        influence the routing of its packets to outside (i.e., 
        determining the next external hop).   
         
        The intent is to provide a generic and simple framework within 
        which a PWLAN AN can advertise its network capabilities for a 
        given PWLAN client to the HSN RADIUS server.  And, the HSN 
        RADIUS server then can specify the Network capability settings 
        that it wants for that PWLAN client.  The specified network 
        capability settings also need to be indicated in the accounting 
        packets. 
    
      Attribute (Network Capability Advertisement) 
    
        This attribute indicates network capabilities that a PWLAN AN 
        can provide for a given PWLAN client.  It SHOULD be sent in 
        Access-Request if available.

   4. IANA Considerations 
    
     To be completed 
    
     This draft introduces new RADIUS Attributes.  Therefore, there is 
     a need for obtaining new attribute TYPE numbers from IANA.  
      
   5. Security Considerations 
    
     The attributes in this document have no additional security 
     considerations beyond those already identified in [?].
