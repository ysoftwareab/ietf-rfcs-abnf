1.  Introduction

   A host may have multiple network interfaces (e.g., 3G, IEEE 802.11,
   etc.); each configured with different PCP servers.  Each PCP server
   learned must be associated with the interface on which it was
   learned.  Generic multi-interface considerations are documented in
   Section 8.4 of [RFC6887].  Multiple PCP server IP addresses may be
   configured on a PCP client in some deployment contexts such as multi-
   homing (see Appendix A).  A PCP server may also have multiple IP
   addresses associated with it.  It is out of scope of this document to
   enumerate all deployment scenarios that require multiple PCP server
   IP addresses to be configured.

   If a PCP client discovers multiple PCP server IP addresses, it needs
   to determine which actions it needs to undertake (e.g., whether PCP
   entries are to be installed in all or a subset of discovered IP

   addresses, whether some PCP entries are to be removed, etc.).  This
   document makes the following assumptions:

   o  There is no requirement that multiple PCP servers configured on
      the same interface have the same capabilities.

   o  PCP requests to different PCP servers are independent, the result
      of a PCP request to one PCP server does not influence another.

   o  The configuration mechanism must distinguish IP addresses that
      belong to the same PCP server.

   This document specifies the behavior to be followed by a PCP client
   [RFC6887] to contact its PCP server(s) [RFC6887] when it is
   configured with one or several PCP server IP addresses (e.g., using
   DHCP [RFC7291]).  This document does make any assumption on the type
   of these IP addresses (i.e., unicast/anycast).

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  PCP client: denotes a PCP software instance responsible for
      issuing PCP requests to a PCP server.  Refer to [RFC6887].
   o  PCP server: denotes a software instance that receives and
      processes PCP requests from a PCP client.  A PCP server can be co-
      located with or be separated from the function it controls (e.g.,
      Network Address Translation (NAT) or firewall).  Refer to
      [RFC6887].

3.  IP Address Selection: PCP Server with Multiple IP Addresses

   This section describes the behavior a PCP client follows to contact
   its PCP server when the PCP client has multiple IP addresses for a
   single PCP server.

   1.  A PCP client should construct a set of candidate source addresses
       (Section 4 of [RFC6724]), based on application input and PCP
       [RFC6887] constraints.  For example, when sending a PEER or a MAP
       with FILTER request for an existing TCP connection, the only
       candidate source address is the source address used for the
       existing TCP connection.  But when sending a MAP request for a
       service that will accept incoming connections, the candidate
       source addresses may be all of the node's IP addresses, or some
       subset of IP addresses on which the service is configured to
       listen.

Internet-Draft            PCP Server Selection              January 2015


   2.  The PCP client then sorts the PCP server IP addresses as per
       Section 6 of [RFC6724] using the candidate source addresses
       selected in the previous step as input to the destination address
       selection algorithm.

   3.  The PCP client initializes its Maximum Retransmission Count (MRC)
       to 4.

   4.  The PCP client sends its PCP messages following the
       retransmission procedure specified in Section 8.1.1 of [RFC6887].
       If no response is received after MRC attempts, the PCP client re-
       tries the procedure with the next IP address in the sorted list.
       If, when sending PCP requests, the PCP client receives a hard
       ICMP error [RFC1122] it MUST immediately try the next IP address
       from the list of PCP server IP addresses.

   5.  If the PCP client has exhausted all IP addresses configured for a
       given PCP server, the procedure SHOULD be repeated every fifteen
       (15) minutes until the PCP request is successfully answered.

   6.  Once the PCP client has successfully received a response from a
       PCP server's IP address, all subsequent PCP requests to that PCP
       server are sent on the same IP address until that IP address
       becomes unresponsive.  In case the IP address becomes
       unresponsive, the PCP client clears the cache of sorted
       destination addresses and follows the steps described above to
       contact the PCP server again.

   For efficiency, the PCP client SHOULD use the same Mapping Nonce for
   requests sent to all IP addresses belonging to the same PCP server.
   As a reminder, nonce validation checks are performed when operating
   in the Simple Threat Model (Section 18.1 of [RFC6887]) to defend
   against some off-path attacks.

4.  IP Address Selection: Multiple PCP Servers

   This section describes the behavior a PCP client follows to contact
   multiple PCP servers, with each PCP server reachable on a list of IP
   addresses.  There is no requirement that these multiple PCP servers
   have the same capabilities.

      Note, how PCP clients are configured to separate lists of IP
      addresses of each PCP server is implementation-specific and
      deployment-specific.  For example, a PCP client can be configured
      using DHCP with multiple lists of PCP server IP addresses; each
      list is referring to a distinct PCP server [RFC7291].

Internet-Draft            PCP Server Selection              January 2015


   If several PCP servers are configured, each with multiple IP
   addresses, the PCP client contacts all PCP servers using the
   procedure described in Section 3.

   As specified in Section 11.2 and Section 12.2 of [RFC6887], the PCP
   client must use a different Mapping Nonce for each PCP server it
   communicates with.

   If the PCP client is configured, using some means, with the
   capabilities of each PCP server, a PCP client may choose to contact
   all PCP servers simultaneously or iterate through them with a delay.

   This procedure may result in a PCP client instantiating multiple
   mappings maintained by distinct PCP servers.  The decision to use all
   these mappings or delete some of them depends on the purpose of the
   PCP request.  For example, if the PCP servers are configuring
   firewall (not NAT) functionality then the client would by default
   (i.e., unless it knows that they all replicate state among them) need
   to use all the PCP servers.

5.  Example: Multiple PCP Servers on a Single Interface

   Figure 1 depicts an example that is used to illustrate the server
   selection procedure specified in Section 3 and Section 4.  In this
   example, PCP servers (A and B) are co-located with edge routers
   (rtr1, rtr2) with each PCP server controlling its own device.

 Edge Routers (rtr1, rtr2)

                                 Figure 1

   The example describes behavior when a single IP address for one PCP
   server is not responsive.  The PCP client is configured with two PCP
   servers for the same interface, PCP-Server-A and PCP-Server-B each
   having two IP addresses, an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address.  The
   PCP client wants an IPv4 mapping so it orders the addresses as
   follows:

   o  PCP-Server-A:

      *  192.0.2.1

      *  2001:db8:1111::1

   o  PCP-Server-B:

      *  198.51.100.1

      *  2001:db8:2222::1

   Suppose that:

   o  The path to reach 192.0.2.1 is broken

   o  The path to reach 2001:db8:1111::1 is working

Internet-Draft            PCP Server Selection              January 2015


   o  The path to reach 198.51.100.1 is working

   o  The path to reach 2001:db8:2222::1 is working

   It sends two PCP requests at the same time, the first to 192.0.2.1
   (corresponding to PCP-Server-A) and the second to 198.51.100.1
   (corresponding to PCP-Server-B).  The path to 198.51.100.1 is working
   so a PCP response is received.  Because the path to 192.0.2.1 is
   broken, no PCP response is received.  The PCP client retries 4 times
   to elicit a response from 192.0.2.1 and finally gives up on that
   address and sends a PCP message to 2001::db8:1111:1.  That path is
   working, and a response is received.  Thereafter, the PCP client
   should continue using that responsive IP address for PCP-Server-A
   (2001:db8:1111::1).  In this particular case, it will have to use
   THIRD_PARTY option for IPv4 mappings.

6.  Security Considerations

   PCP related security considerations are discussed in [RFC6887].

   This document does not specify how PCP server addresses are
   provisioned on the PCP client.  It is the responsibility of PCP
   server provisioning document(s) to elaborate on security
   considerations to discover legitimate PCP servers.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any action from IANA.

Appendix A.  Multi-homing

   The main problem of a PCP multi-homing situation can be succinctly
   described as 'one PCP client, multiple PCP servers'.  As described in
   Section 3, if a PCP client discovers multiple PCP servers, it should
   send requests to all of them with assumptions described in Section 1.

   The following sub-sections describe multi-homing examples to
   illustrate the PCP client behavior.

A.1.  IPv6 Multi-homing

   In this example of an IPv6 multi-homed network, two or more routers
   co-located with firewalls are present on a single link shared with
   the host(s).  Each router is in turn connected to a different service
   provider network and the host in this environment would be offered
   multiple prefixes and advertised multiple DNS servers.  Consider a
   scenario in which firewalls within an IPv6 multi-homing environment
   also implement a PCP server.  The PCP client learns the available PCP
   servers using DHCP [RFC7291] or any other provisioning mechanism.  In
   reference to Figure 2, a typical model is to embed DHCP servers in
   rtr1 and rtr2.  A host located behind rtr1 and rtr2 can contact these
   two DHCP servers and retrieve from each server the IP address(es) of
   the corresponding PCP server.

   The PCP client will send PCP requests in parallel to each of the PCP
   servers.

                        Figure 2: IPv6 Multihoming

A.2.  IPv4 Multi-homing

   In this example an IPv4 multi-homed network described in 'NAT- or
   RFC2260-based multi-homing' (Section 3.3 of [RFC4116]), the gateway
   router is connected to different service provider networks.  This
   method uses Provider-Aggregatable (PA) addresses assigned by each
   transit provider to which the site is connected.  The site uses NAT
   to translate the various provider addresses into a single set of
   private-use addresses within the site.  In such a case, two PCP
   servers might have to be present to configure NAT to each of the
   transit providers.  The PCP client learns the available PCP servers
   using DHCP [RFC7291] or any other provisioning mechanism.  In
   reference to Figure 3, a typical model is to embed the DHCP server
   and the PCP servers in rtr1.  A host located behind rtr1 can contact
   the DHCP server to obtain IP addresses of the PCP servers.  The PCP
   client will send PCP requests in parallel to each of the PCP servers.
