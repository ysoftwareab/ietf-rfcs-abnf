1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element communication
   Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between
   two PCEs based on the PCE architecture [RFC4655].  [RFC5394] provides
   additional details on policy within the PCE architecture and also
   provides context for the support of PCE Policy.

Internet-Draft                ASSOC-POLICY                     June 2020


   PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE Model [RFC8231] describes a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable active control of Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   tunnels.  [RFC8281] describes the set-up and teardown of PCE-
   initiated LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the need
   for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic
   network.  Currently, the LSPs can either be signaled via Resource
   Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) or can be segment
   routed as specified in [RFC8664].

   [RFC8697] introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs
   which can then be used to define associations between a set of LSPs
   and a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters or
   behaviors) and is equally applicable to stateful PCE (active and
   passive modes) and stateless PCE.

   This document specifies a PCEP extension to associate one or more
   LSPs with policies using the generic association mechanism.

   A PCEP speaker may want to influence the PCEP peer with respect to
   path selection and other policies.  This document describes a PCEP
   extension to associate policies by creating Policy Association Group
   (PAG) and encoding this association in PCEP messages.  The
   specification is applicable to both stateful and stateless PCEP
   sessions.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   Association parameters:  As described in [RFC8697], the combination
      of the mandatory fields Association type, Association ID and
      Association Source in the ASSOCIATION object uniquely identify the
      association group.  If the optional TLVs - Global Association
      Source or Extended Association ID are included, then they are
      included in combination with mandatory fields to uniquely identify
      the association group.

   Association information:  As described in [RFC8697], the ASSOCIATION
      object could include other optional TLVs based on the association
      types, that provides 'information' related to the association.

   LSR:  Label Switch Router.

   MPLS:  Multiprotocol Label Switching.

   PAG:  Policy Association Group.

   PAT:  Policy Association Type.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol.

3.  Motivation

   Paths computed using PCE can be subjected to various policies on both
   PCE and PCC.  For example, in a centralized traffic engineering
   scenario, network operators may instantiate LSPs and specifies
   policies for traffic steering, path monitoring, etc., for some LSPs
   via the Stateful PCE.  Similarly, a PCC could request a user- or
   service-specific policy to be applied at the PCE, such as constraints
   relaxation to meet optimal QoS and resiliency.

   PCEP speaker can use the generic mechanism as per [RFC8697] to
   associate a set of LSPs with a policy, without the need to know the
   details of such a policy, which simplifies network operations, avoids
   frequent software upgrades, as well as provides an ability to
   introduce new policy faster.

3.1.  Policy based Constraints

   In the context of policy-enabled path computation [RFC5394], path
   computation policies may be applied at both a PCC and a PCE.
   Consider an Label Switch Router (LSR) with a policy enabled PCC, it
   receives a service request via signaling, including over a Network-
   Network Interface (NNI) or User Network Interface (UNI) reference
   point, or receives a configuration request over a management
   interface to establish a service.  The PCC may also apply user- or
   service-specific policies to decide how the path selection process
   should be constrained, that is, which constraints, diversities,
   optimization criterion, and constraint relaxation strategies should
   be applied in order for the service LSP(s) to have a likelihood to be
   successfully established and provide necessary QoS and resilience
   against network failures.  The user- or service-specific policies

Internet-Draft                ASSOC-POLICY                     June 2020


   applied to PCC and are then passed to the PCE along with the Path
   computation request, in the form of constraints [RFC5394].

   PCEP speaker can use the generic mechanism as per [RFC8697] to
   associate a set of LSPs with policy and its resulting path
   computation constraints.  This would simplify the path computation
   message exchanges in PCEP.

4.  Overview

   As per [RFC8697], LSPs are associated with other LSPs with which they
   interact by adding them to a common association group.  Grouping can
   also be used to define association between LSPs and policies
   associated to them.  One new Association type is defined in this
   document, based on the generic Association object -

   o  Association type = TBD1 ("Policy Association Type (PAT)" ) for
      Policy Association Group (PAG).

   [RFC8697] specify the mechanism for the capability advertisement of
   the Association types supported by a PCEP speaker by defining a
   ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an OPEN object.  This
   capability exchange for the association type described in this
   document (i.e.  PAT) MUST be done before using the policy
   association.  Thus the PCEP speaker MUST include the PAT (TBD1) in
   the ASSOC-Type-List TLV before using the PAG in the PCEP messages.

   This Association type is operator-configured association in nature
   and created by the operator manually on the PCEP peers.  An LSP
   belonging to this association is conveyed via PCEP messages to the
   PCEP peer.  Operator-configured Association Range need not be set for
   this association-type, and MUST be ignored, so that the full range of
   association identifier can be utilized.

   A PAG can have one or more LSPs and its associated policy.  The
   association parameters including association identifier, Association
   type (Policy), as well as the association source IP address is
   manually configured by the operator and is used to identify the PAG
   as described in [RFC8697].  The Global Association Source and
   Extended Association ID MAY also be included.

   As per the processing rules specified in section 6.4 of [RFC8697], if
   a PCEP speaker does not support this Policy Association type, it
   would return a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 "Association Error"
   and Error-Value 1 "Association type is not supported".  Since the PAG
   is opaque in nature, the PAG and the policy MUST be configured on the
   PCEP peers as per the operator-configured association procedures.
   All further processing is as per section 6.4 of [RFC8697].  If a PCE



Litkowski, et al.       Expires December 24, 2020               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                ASSOC-POLICY                     June 2020


   speaker receives PAG in a PCEP message, and the policy association
   information is not configured, it MUST return a PCErr message with
   Error-Type 26 "Association Error" and Error- Value 4 "Association
   unknown".  If some of the association information [RFC8697] (the TLVs
   defined in this document) received from the peer does not match the
   local configured values, the PCEP speaker MUST reject the PCEP
   message and send a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 "Association
   Error" and Error-Value 5 "Operator-configured association information
   mismatch".

   Associating a particular LSP to multiple policy groups is authorized
   from a protocol perspective, however there is no assurance that the
   PCE will be able to apply multiple policies.

5.  Policy Association Group

   Association groups and their memberships are defined using the
   ASSOCIATION object defined in [RFC8697].  Two object types for IPv4
   and IPv6 are defined.  The ASSOCIATION object includes "Association
   type" indicating the type of the association group.  This document
   add a new Association type -

   Association type = TBD1 ("Policy Association type") for PAG.

   PAG may carry optional TLVs including but not limited to -

   o  POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV: Used to communicate opaque information
      useful to apply the policy, described in Section 5.1.

   o  VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV: Used to communicate arbitrary vendor
      specific behavioural information, described in [RFC7470].

5.1.  Policy Parameters TLV

   The POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV is an optional TLV that can be carried in
   ASSOCIATION object (for PAT) to carry opaque information needed to
   apply the policy at the PCEP peer.  In some cases to apply a PCE
   policy successfully, it is required to also associate some policy
   parameters that needs to be evaluated, to successfully apply the said
   policy.  This TLV is used to carry those policy parameters.  The TLV
   could include one or more policy related parameter.  The encoding
   format and the order MUST be known to the PCEP peers, this could be
   done during the configuration of the policy (and its association
   parameters) for the PAG.  The TLV format is as per the format of the
   PCEP TLVs, as defined in [RFC5440], and shown in Figure 2.  Only one
   POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV can be carried and only the first occurrence is
   processed and any others MUST be ignored.

      +---------------------------------------------------------------+



                Figure 2: The POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV format

   The type of the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV is TBD2 and it has a variable
   length.  The Value field is variable field padded to a 4-bytes
   alignment; padding is not included in the Length field.  The PCEP
   peer implementation need to be aware of the encoding format, order,
   and meaning of the 'Policy Parameters' well in advance based on the
   policy.  Note that from the protocol point of view this data is
   opaque and can be used to carry parameters in any format understood
   by the PCEP peers and associated to the policy.  The exact use of
   this TLV is beyond the scope of this document.

   If the PCEP peer is unaware of the policy parameters associated with
   the policy and it receives the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV, it MUST ignore
   the TLV and SHOULD log this event.  Further, if one or more
   parameters received in the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV received by the PCEP
   speaker are considered as unacceptable in the context of the
   associated policy (e.g. out of range value, badly encoded value...),
   the PCEP speaker MUST NOT apply the received policy and SHOULD log
   this event.

   Note that, the vendor specific behavioral information is encoded in
   VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV which can be used along with this TLV.

   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalogue of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

6.1.  Cisco's Implementation

   o  Organization: Cisco Systems, Inc.

   o  Implementation: IOS-XR PCE and PCC.

   o  Description: The PCEP extension specified in this document is used
      to convey traffic steering policies.

   o  Maturity Level: In shipping product.

   o  Coverage: Partial.

   o  Contact: mkoldych@cisco.com

7.  Security Considerations

   This document defines one new type for association, which do not add
   any new security concerns beyond those discussed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231] and [RFC8697] in itself.

   Extra care needs to be taken by the implementation with respect to
   POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV while decoding, verifying and applying these
   policy variables.  This TLV parsing could be exploited by an
   attacker.

   Some deployments may find policy associations and their implications
   as extra sensitive and thus securing the PCEP session using Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8253], as per the recommendations and best
   current practices in BCP 195 [RFC7525], is RECOMMENDED.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Association object Type Indicators

   This document defines a new Association type.  The sub-registry
   "ASSOCIATION Type Field" of the "Path Computation Element Protocol
   (PCEP) Numbers" registry was originally defined in [RFC8697].  IANA
   is requested to confirm the early-allocated codepoints.

   Value     Name                        Reference

   3         Policy Association          [This.I-D]

8.2.  PCEP TLV Type Indicators

   The following TLV Type Indicator value is requested within the "PCEP
   TLV Type Indicators" subregistry of the "Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry.  IANA is requested to confirm the
   early-allocated codepoints.

   Value     Description                 Reference

   48        POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV       [This.I-D]

9.  Manageability Considerations

9.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   An operator MUST be allowed to configure the policy associations at
   PCEP peers and associate it with the LSPs.  They MAY also allow
   configuration to related policy parameters, in which case the an
   operator MUST also be allowed to set the encoding format and order to
   parse the associated policy parameters TLV.

9.2.  Information and Data Models

   [RFC7420] describes the PCEP MIB, there are no new MIB Objects for
   this document.

   The PCEP YANG module is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang].  This
   module supports associations as defined in [RFC8697] and thus support
   the Policy Association groups.

   An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to view the PAG
   configured.  Further implementation SHOULD allow to view associations
   reported by each peer, and the current set of LSPs in the PAG.

9.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].

9.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].

9.5.  Requirements on Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.

9.6.  Impact on Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].

10.  Acknowledgments

   A special thanks to author of [RFC8697], this document borrow some of
   the text from it.
