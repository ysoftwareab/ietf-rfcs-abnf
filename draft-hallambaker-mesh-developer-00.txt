                  Mathematical Mesh: Developer?s Guide
                  draft-hallambaker-mesh-developer-00

Abstract

   The Mathematical Mesh ?The Mesh? is an end-to-end secure
   infrastructure that facilitates the exchange of configuration and
   credential data between multiple user devices.

   This document describes how to install and run the Mesh reference
   code and make use of the reference code in applications.  It does not
   form a part of the Mesh specifications and is not normative.

1.  Getting the Reference Code and Build Tools

   The Mesh Reference library was developed using Visual Studio 2015
   Community Edition using PHB?s Build Tools extensions.  The reference
   code itself is currently limited to C# libraries.

   The code should in theory run under other operating systems but this
   is not currently tested.

   Development under different development environments is also possible
   but would require re-engineering to make use of the line mode
   versions of the build tools.

1.1.  Obtaining the Development Environment

   Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition is currently available at no
   cost for a wide range of non-commercial development including
   personal use and development of Open Source software.  For full
   details, please consult the license published by Microsoft.

   https://www.visualstudio.com/

1.2.  Obtaining the Build Tools

   Over half the code in the reference code library is generated using
   code generators.  These are used to ensure that the specification,
   examples and reference code are always kept in synchronization.

   The build tools are published under an MIT License and are available
   in two forms:

   As stand-alone tools to be run from the command line.

   As a VSIX package that integrates into the Visual Studio environment.

   The source distribution is configured to use the tools integrated
   into the Visual Studio environment.  If development on other
   platforms is desired, the simplest approach is likely to be to write
   a tool that reads the Visual Studio configuration files and generates
   the corresponding files for use with make.

   The VSIX package is available from the Visual Studio extensions
   gallery:

   PHB Code Generation Tools

   The source code for the build tools is available from:

   https://sourceforge.net/projects/phb-build-tools/

1.3.  Obtaining the Mesh Source Libraries

   The Mesh reference library source code is published under an MIT
   license and is available from:

   https://sourceforge.net/projects/mathematicalmesh/

2.  Running the Reference Code Examples

   The reference code examples are designed to illustrate how the Mesh
   might be used in an application rather than be standalone tools in
   their own right.  The Mesh is designed to make it each for developers
   to add security to their own applications rather than providing the
   applications themselves.

2.1.  Starting the Server

   On the Windows platform, the server runs in the context of the
   platform Web server and must be granted permission to bind to the
   range of server addresses used using the netsh command.

   From a command prompt with administrator privileges, run the
   following command:

   netsh http add urlacl http:///.well-known/mmm/ \user=\

   Where is the DNS domain name under which the service is run, is the
   Windows domain name of the machine and the account name.

   To start the service from the command line type:

   servermesh

   The server does not require administration privileges.

2.2.  The Profile Manager Wizard

   The profile manager wizard demonstrates functions that are performed
   on an administration device.  These include creating a completely new
   profile and initial configuration of applications, connecting a
   device to the profile and recovery of the profile from escrow data.

   To run the client from the command line, place the executable image
   in a location that it will be found in the PATH variable and type:

   meshclient

2.3.  The Profile Connection Wizard

   The Profile connection wizard demonstrates the much more restricted
   functionality that would be required in a Mesh connected application
   and/or a profile manager for a non-administration device.

   To run the client from the command line, place the executable image
   in a location that it will be found in the PATH variable and type:

   meshconnect

3.  Platform specific configuration data

3.1.  Windows

3.1.1.  Private Key Data

   All private key data is stored using the Windows public key store.
   At minimum, this ensures that private keys are obfuscated and
   encrypted under the account password to protect the data against
   casual extraction attacks.  On a machine with cryptographic hardware
   support such as a TPM or HSM, extraction of the private key may be
   infeasible without physical access to the machine and possibly
   require sophisticated diagnostic equipment.

3.1.2.  Registry settings

   Separate settings are used for production and test code.  Test Code
   should use the Registry Hive:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\CryptoMesh

   Production code should use the hive

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\MathematicalMesh

   In either case the sub structure is:



      Accounts  Contains the set of Mesh Portal Accounts for the user.
         The default value is the account name of the default account.
         The Name of the each key is a portal account name and the value
         a REG_SZ entry containing the UDF of the profile master key.

Internet-Draft         Mathematical Mesh Developer          January 2016


      PersonalProfiles  Contains the set of Mesh Profiles for the user.
         The default value is the UDF of the default profile master key.
         The Name of each key is the UDF of the master key and the value
         a REG_SZ entry containing the file location of the cached copy
         of the personal profile.

      ThisDevice  Contains the set of Device profiles in the same format
         as the PersonalProfiles.

3.1.3.  Profile data files

   The profile data itself is stored in data files at the location
   specified in the registry.  The files are standard XML files in UTF8
   encoding.

3.2.  OSX and Linux

   [[Not yet implemented, subject to change.]

   All configuration information is stored in the user directory ~/.mmm

   Keys are stored in SSH key file format [RFC4716] using the customary
   name and extension conventions for that application.

4.  Using the Mesh C#/.Net Libraries in an Application

   The application ExampleGenerator shows the use of the Mesh in an
   application using the convenience API.  It is the application program
   used to generate the examples in the reference document.

   ExampleGenerator implements a client that connects to a remote
   WebService, creates new personal profile with an escrow entry with
   offline recovery codes, attaches applications and other devices,
   updates an application profile, deletes all the profile data from the
   local machine and then restores them using the recovery codes and
   escrow entry.

4.1.  Creating a Portal Client Connection

   The normal method of creating a Portal Client connection is?

   Since the purpose of the ExampleGenerator is to create examples for
   the documentation, it is not necessary for the JSON Remote Procedure
   Calls to actually be ?Remote?. Instead the ?Local?  Procedure Call
   mode is used in which the client and server both run in the same
   process with the client API invoking the server dispatch methods
   through an interface that performs JSON serialization and
   deserialization but does not invoke the network transport.

   ?.

   For purposes of testing and initial development of a Web Service it
   is frequently desirable to further simplify the implementation by
   dispensing with the serialization layer and the client calling the
   server dispatch methods directly.

4.2.  Checking that a Portal Account name is acceptable

4.3.  Creating a Personal Profile

4.4.  Creating an Offline Escrow Entry

4.5.  Publishing the Profile and Escrow Entries

4.6.  Attaching a New Device

4.7.  Attaching a new Application

4.8.  Deleting Profile Data

4.9.  Recovering Profile Data

5.  Using other languages

   If you are building Mesh applications in another language, the least
   effort approach may be to rewrite the PROTOGEN build tool to target
   your language.

   Protogen does support generation of C header files that may be used
   to drive a parser.  If however you are adding Mesh support for an
   application that already uses JSON based protocols, you might want to
   edit the generator scripting files to generate code for your existing
   libraries.
