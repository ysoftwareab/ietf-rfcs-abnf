1.  Introduction

   Recent studies (see e.g.[I-D.gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-in-real-world])
   suggest that there is widespread filtering of IPv6 packets that
   contain IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs).  While some operators
   "officially" filter packets that contain IPv6 extension headers, it
   is possible that some of the measured packet drops be the result of
   improper configuration defaults, or inappropriate advice in this
   area.

   This document discusses the filtering of IPv6 packets based on the
   IPv6 Extension Headers and the IPv6 options they contain.  Since
   various protocols may use IPv6 Extension Headers (possibly with IPv6
   options), discarding packets based on the the IPv6 Extension Headers
   or IPv6 options they contain may have implications on the proper
   functioning of such protocols.  Thus, this document attempts to
   discuss the operational and interoperability implications of such
   filtering policies, and provide advice in this area.  This document

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs        August 2014


   is similar in nature to [RFC7126], which addresses the same problem
   for the IPv4 case.

   Section 3 of this document discusses IPv6 extension headers and IPv6
   options, and provides advice in the area of filtering IPv6 packets
   that contain such IPv6 Extension Headers and/or options.

2.  Terminology and Conventions Used in This Document

2.1.  Terminology

   The terms "fast path", "slow path", and associated relative terms
   ("faster path" and "slower path") are loosely defined as in Section 2
   of [RFC6398].

   The terms "permit" (allow the traffic), "drop" (drop with no
   notification to sender), and "reject" (drop with appropriate
   notification to sender) are employed as defined in [RFC3871].
   Throughout this document we also employ the term "discard" as a
   generic term to indicate the act of discarding packet, irrespective
   of whether the sender is notified of such drops.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Conventions

   This document assumes that nodes comply with the requirements in
   [RFC7045].  Namely (from [RFC7045]),

   o  If a forwarding node discards a packet containing a standard IPv6
      extension header, it MUST be the result of a configurable policy
      and not just the result of a failure to recognise such a header.

   o  The discard policy for each standard type of extension header MUST
      be individually configurable.

   o  The default configuration SHOULD allow all standard extension
      headers.

   The advice provided in this document is only meant to guide an
   operator in configuring forwarding devices, and is *not* to be
   interpreted as advice regarding default configuration settings for
   network devices.  That is, this document provides advice with respect
   to operational configurations, but does not change the implementation
   defaults required by [RFC7045].

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs        August 2014


   We recommend that a configuration option is made available to govern
   the processing of each IPv6 Extension Header type and each IPv6
   option type.  Such option configuration options may include the
   following possible settings:

   o  Permit this IPv6 Extension Header or IPv6 Option type

   o  Drop (and log) packets containing this IPv6 Extension Header or
      option type

   o  Reject and log packets containing this IPv6 Extension Header or
      option type (where the packet drop is signaled with an ICMPv6
      error message)

   o  Rate-limit the processing of packets containing this IPv6
      Extension Header or option type

   o  Ignore this IPv6 Extension Header or option type (forwarding
      packets that contain them)

   We note that special care needs to be taken when devices log packet
   drops/rejects.  Devices SHOULD count the number of packets dropped/
   rejected, but the logging of drop/reject events SHOULD be limited so
   as to not overburden device resources.

   Finally, we note that when discarding packets, it is generally
   desirable that the sender be signaled of the packet drop, since this
   is of use for trouble-shooting purposes.  However, throughout this
   document (when recommending that packets be discarded) we generically
   refer to the action as "discard" without specifying whether the
   sender is signaled of the packet drop.

3.  IPv6 Extension Headers

3.1.  General Discussion

   IPv6 [RFC2460] Extension Headers allow for the extension of the IPv6
   protocol.  Since both IPv6 Extension Headers and upper-layer
   protocols share the same namespace ("Next Header" registry/
   namespace), [RFC7045] identifies which of the currently assigned
   Internet Protocol numbers identify IPv6 Extension Headers vs. upper-
   layer protocols.  This document discusses the filtering of packets
   based on the IPv6 Extension Headers (as specified by [RFC7045]) they
   contain. .

      NOTE: [RFC7112] specifies that non-fragmented IPv6 datagrams and
      IPv6 First-Fragments, must contain the entire IPv6 header chain
      [RFC7112].  Therefore, intermediate systems can always enforce the

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs        August 2014


      filtering policies discussed in this document, or resort to simply
      discarding the offending packets when they fail to comply with the
      requirements in [RFC7112].

3.2.  General Security Implications

   Depending on the specific device architecture, IPv6 packets that
   contain IPv6 Extension Headers may cause the corresponding packets to
   be processed on the slow path, and hence may be leveraged for the
   purpose of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks [Cisco-EH] [FW-Benchmark].

   Operators are urged to consider IPv6 Extension Header filtering and
   IPv6 options handling capabilities of different devices as they make
   deployment decisions in future.

3.3.  Advice on the Handling of IPv6 Packets with Specific IPv6
      Extension Headers

3.3.1.  IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options (Protocol Number=0)

3.3.1.1.  Uses

   The Hop-by-Hop Options header is used to carry optional information
   that should be examined by every node along a packet's delivery path.
   At the time of this writing, the following options have been
   specified for the Hop-by-Hop Options extension header:

   o  Router Alert [RFC2711]

   o  Jumbo Payload [RFC2675]

   o  RPL Option [RFC6553]

   o  SMF_DPD [RFC6621]

   o  MPL Option [I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast]

   o  IPv6 DFF Header [RFC6971]

3.3.1.2.  Specification

   This Extension Header is specified in [RFC2460], and its processing
   rules have been updated by [RFC7045].

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs        August 2014


3.3.1.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Since this Extension Header should be processed by all intermediate-
   systems en route, it can be leveraged to perform Denial of Service
   attacks against the network infrastructure.

3.3.1.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets containing a Hop-by-Hop Option extension header
   would break any of the protocols that rely on it for proper
   functioning.  For example, it would break RSVP [RFC2205] and
   multicast deployments, and would cause IPv6 jumbograms to be dropped.

3.3.1.5.  Advice

   The recommended configuration for the processing of these packets
   depends on the features and capabilities of the underlying platform.
   On platforms that allow forwarding of packets with HBH Options on the
   fast path, we recommend that packets with a HBH Options extension
   header be forwarded as normal (for instance, [RFC7045] allows for
   implementations to ignore the HBH Options extension header when
   forwarding packets).  Otherwise, on platforms in which processing of
   packets with a IPv6 HBH Options extension header is carried out in
   the slow path, and an option is provided to rate-limit these packets,
   we recommend that this option be selected.  Finally, when packets
   containing a HBH Options extension header are processed in the slow-
   path, and the underlying platform does not have any mitigation
   options available for attacks based on these packets, we recommend
   that such platforms discard packets containing IPv6 HBH Options
   extension headers.

   Additionally, we note that those intermediate systems processing the
   contents of the HBH Options extension header should discard packets
   that contain more than one instance of the Router Alert option (see
   [RFC2711].

   Finally, we note that, for obvious reasons, RPL (Routing Protocol for
   Low-Power and Lossy Networks) [RFC6550] routers must not drop packets
   based on the presence of an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options Extension Header.

3.3.2.  Routing Header for IPv6 (Protocol Number=43)

3.3.2.1.  Uses

   The Routing header is used by an IPv6 source to list one or more
   intermediate nodes to be "visited" on the way to a packet's
   destination.

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs        August 2014


3.3.2.2.  Specification

   This Extension Header is specified in [RFC2460].  [RFC2460]
   originally specified the Routing Header Type 0, which has been later
   obsoleted by [RFC5095].

   At the time of this writing, the following Routing Types have been
   specified:

   o  Type 0: Source Route (DEPRECATED) [RFC2460] [RFC5095]

   o  Type 1: Nimrod (DEPRECATED)

   o  Type 2: Type 2 Routing Header [RFC6275]

   o  Type 3: RPL Source Route Header [RFC6554]

   o  Types 4-252: Unassigned

   o  Type 253: RFC3692-style Experiment 1 [RFC4727]

   o  Type 254: RFC3692-style Experiment 2 [RFC4727]

   o  Type 255: Reserved

3.3.2.3.  Specific Security Implications

   The security implications of RHT0 have been discussed in detail in
   [Biondi2007] and [RFC5095].

3.3.2.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Blocking packets containing a RHT0 or RTH1 has no operational
   implications.  However, blocking packets employing other routing
   header types will break the protocols that rely on them.

3.3.2.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should discard packets containing a RHT0 or
   RHT1.  As required by [RFC7045], packets containing standardised and
   undeprecated Routing Headers should be permitted.

3.3.3.  Fragment Header for IPv6 (Protocol Number=44)

   IPv6.

3.3.3.2.  Specification

   This Extension Header is specified in [RFC2460].

3.3.3.3.  Specific Security Implications

   The security implications of the Fragment Header range from Denial of
   Service attacks (e.g. based on flooding a target with IPv6 fragments)
   to information leakage attacks
   [I-D.ietf-6man-predictable-fragment-id].

3.3.3.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Blocking packets that contain a Fragment Header will break any
   protocol that may rely on fragmentation (e.g., the DNS [RFC1034]).

3.3.3.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should permit packets that contain a Fragment
   Header.

3.3.4.  Encapsulating Security Payload (Protocol Number=50)

3.3.4.1.  Uses

   This extension Header is employed for the IPsec suite [RFC4303].

3.3.4.2.  Specification

   This extension header is specified in [RFC4303].

3.3.4.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Besides the general implications of IPv6 Extension Headers, this
   extension header could be employed to potentially perform a DoS
   attack at the destination system by wasting CPU resources in
   validating the contents of the packet.

3.3.4.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that employ this extension header would break
   IPsec deployments.

3.3.4.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should permit packets containing the
   Encapsulating Security Payload extension header.

3.3.5.  Authentication Header (Number=51)

3.3.5.1.  Uses

   The Authentication Header can be employed for provide authentication
   services in IPv4 and IPv6.

3.3.5.2.  Specification

   This Extension Header is specified in [RFC4302].

3.3.5.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Besides the general implications of IPv6 Extension Headers, this
   extension header could be employed to potentially perform a DoS
   attack at the destination system by wasting CPU resources in
   validating the contents of the packet.

3.3.5.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that employ this extension header would break
   IPsec deployments.

3.3.5.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should permit packets containing an
   Authentication Header.

3.3.6.  Destination Options for IPv6 (Protocol Number=60)

3.3.6.1.  Uses

   The Destination Options header is used to carry optional information
   that need be examined only by a packet's destination node(s).

3.3.6.2.  Specification

   This Extension Header is specified in [RFC2460].  At the time of this
   writing, the following options have been specified for this extension
   header:

   o  Type 0x04: Tunnel Encapsulation Limit [RFC2473]

   o  Type 0xC9: Home Address [RFC6275]

   o  Type 0x8B: ILNP Nonce [RFC6744]

   o  Type 0x8C: Line-Identification Option [RFC6788]

3.3.6.3.  Specific Security Implications

   No security implications are known, other than the general
   implications of IPv6 extension headers.

3.3.6.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that contain a Destination Options header would
   break protocols that rely on this EH type for conveying information,
   including protocols such as ILNP [RFC6740] an Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275],
   and IPv6 tunnels that employ the Tunnel Encapsulation Limit option.

3.3.6.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should permit packets that contain a Destination
   Options Header.

3.3.7.  Mobility Header (Number=135)

3.3.7.1.  Uses

   The Mobility Header is an extension header used by mobile nodes,
   correspondent nodes, and home agents in all messaging related to the
   creation and management of bindings in Mobile IPv6.

3.3.7.2.  Specification

   This Extension Header is specified in [RFC6275].

3.3.7.3.  Specific Security Implications

   TBD.

3.3.7.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should permit packets containing this extension
   header.

3.3.8.  Host Identity Protocol (Protocol Number=139)

3.3.8.1.  Uses

   This extension header is employed with the Host Identity Protocol
   (HIP), an experimental protocol that allows consenting hosts to
   securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing
   separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses,
   thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address
   changes.

3.3.8.2.  Specification

   This extension Header is specified in [RFC5201].

3.3.8.3.  Specific Security Implications

   TBD.

3.3.8.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that contain the Host Identity Protocol would
   break HIP deployments.

3.3.8.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should permit packets that contain a Host
   Identity Protocol extension header.

3.3.9.  Shim6 Protocol (Protocol Number=140)

3.3.9.1.  Uses

3.3.9.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that contain this extension header would break
   Shim6.

3.3.9.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should permit packets containing this extension
   header.

3.3.10.  Use for experimentation and testing (Protocol Numbers=253 and
         254)

3.3.10.1.  Uses

   These IPv6 extension headers are employed for performing
   RFC3692-Style experiments (see [RFC3692] for details).

3.3.10.2.  Specification

   This Extension Header is specified in [RFC3692] and [RFC4727].

3.3.10.3.  Specific Security Implications

   None.

3.3.10.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   For obvious reasons, discarding packets that contain these extension
   headers limits the ability to perform legitimate experiments across
   IPv6 routers.

3.3.10.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should discard packets containing these
   extension headers.

4.  IPv6 Options

4.1.  General Discussion

   The following subsections describe specific security implications of
   different IPv6 options, and provide advice regarding filtering
   packets that contain such options.

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs        August 2014


4.2.  General Security Implications of IPv6 Options

   The general security implications of IPv6 options are closely related
   to those discussed in Section 3.2.  Essentially, packets that contain
   IPv6 options might need to be processed by an IPv6 router's general-
   purpose CPU,and hence could present a DDoS risk to that router's
   general-purpose CPU (and thus to the router itself).  For some
   architectures, a possible mitigation would be to rate-limit the
   packets that are to be processed by the general-purpose CPU (see e.g.
   [Cisco-EH]).

4.3.  Advice on the Handling of Packets with Specific IPv6 Options

   The following subsections contain a description of each of the IPv6
   options that have so far been specified, a discussion of possible
   interoperability implications if packets containing such options are
   dropped, and specific advice on whether to drop packets containing
   these options.

4.3.1.  Pad1 (Type=0x00)

4.3.1.1.  Uses

   This option is used when necessary to align subsequent options and to
   pad out the containing header to a multiple of 8 octets in length.

4.3.1.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC2460].

4.3.1.3.  Specific Security Implications

   None.

4.3.1.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that contain this option would potentially break
   any protocol that relies on IPv6 extension headers.

4.3.1.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should not discard packets based on the presence
   of this option.

4.3.2.1.  Uses

   This option is used when necessary to align subsequent options and to
   pad out the containing header to a multiple of 8 octets in length.

4.3.2.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC2460].

4.3.2.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Because of the possible size of this option, it could be leveraged as
   a large-bandwidth covert channel.

4.3.2.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that contain this option would potentially break
   any protocol that relies on IPv6 extension headers.

4.3.2.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should not discard IPv6 packets based on the
   presence of this option.

4.3.3.  Jumbo Payload (Type=0XC2)

4.3.3.1.  Uses

   The Jumbo payload option provides the means of specifying payloads
   larger than 65535 bytes.

4.3.3.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC2675].

4.3.3.3.  Specific Security Implications

   TBD.

4.3.3.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets based on the presence would this option would
   cause IPv6 jumbograms to be dropped.

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs        August 2014


4.3.3.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should discard packets that contain this option.
   This policy could be overridden in specific environments where
   support for IPv6 jumbograms is desired.

4.3.4.  RPL Option (Type=0x63)

4.3.4.1.  Uses

   The RPL Option provides a mechanism to include routing information
   with each datagram that an RPL router forwards.

4.3.4.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC6553].

4.3.4.3.  Specific Security Implications

   TBD.

4.3.4.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   This option is meant to be employed within an RPL instance.  As a
   result, discarding packets based on the presence of this option at
   e.g. an ISP does will not result in operational implications.

4.3.4.5.  Advice

   Non-RPL routers should discard packets that contain an RPL option.

4.3.5.  Tunnel Encapsulation Limit (Type=0x04)

4.3.5.1.  Uses

   The Tunnel Encapsulation Limit option can be employed to specify how
   many further levels of nesting the packet is permitted to undergo.

4.3.5.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC2473].

4.3.5.3.  Specific Security Implications

   TBD.

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs        August 2014


4.3.5.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets based on the presence of this option could result
   in tunnel traffic being dropped.

4.3.5.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should not discard packets based on the presence
   of this option.

   Since this option is meant to be included in the Destination Options
   Header, an intermediate system should discard packets that employ
   this option in any other extension header type.

4.3.6.  Router Alert (Type=0x05)

4.3.6.1.  Uses

   The Router Alert option [RFC2711]is typically employed for the RSVP
   protocol [RFC2205] and the MLD protocol [RFC2710].

4.3.6.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC2711].

4.3.6.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Since this option causes the contents of the packet to be inspected
   by the handling device, this option could be leveraged for performing
   DoS attacks.

4.3.6.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that contain this option would break RSVP and
   multicast deployments.

4.3.6.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should discard packets that contain this option.

4.3.7.  Quick-Start (Type=0x26)

4.3.7.1.  Uses

   This IP Option is used in the specification of Quick-Start for TCP
   and IP, which is an experimental mechanism that allows transport
   protocols, in cooperation with routers, to determine an allowed

   sending rate at the start and, at times, in the middle of a data
   transfer (e.g., after an idle period) [RFC4782].

4.3.7.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC4782], on the "Experimental" track.

4.3.7.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Section 9.6 of [RFC4782] notes that Quick-Start is vulnerable to two
   kinds of attacks:

   o  attacks to increase the routers' processing and state load, and,

   o  attacks with bogus Quick-Start Requests to temporarily tie up
      available Quick-Start bandwidth, preventing routers from approving
      Quick-Start Requests from other connections.

4.3.7.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   The Quick-Start functionality would be disabled, and additional
   delays in TCP's connection establishment (for example) could be
   introduced.  (Please see Section 4.7.2 of [RFC4782].)  We note,
   however, that Quick-Start has been proposed as a mechanism that could
   be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that
   would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the
   global Internet [RFC4782].

4.3.7.5.  Advice

   A given router, security gateway, or firewall system has no way of
   knowing a priori whether this option is valid in its operational
   environment.  Therefore, routers, security gateways, and firewalls
   should not drop IPv6 packets based on the presence of this option.

      We note that if routers in a given environment do not implement
      and enable the Quick-Start mechanism, only the general security
      implications of IP options (discussed in Section 4.2) would apply.

4.3.8.  CALIPSO (Type=0x07)

4.3.8.1.  Uses

   This option is used for encoding explicit packet Sensitivity Labels
   on IPv6 packets.  It is intended for use only within Multi-Level
   Secure (MLS) networking environments that are both trusted and
   trustworthy.

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs        August 2014


4.3.8.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC5570].

4.3.8.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Presence of this option in a packet does not by itself create any
   specific new threat.  Packets with this option ought not normally be
   seen on the global public Internet.

4.3.8.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   If packets with this option are discarded or if the option is
   stripped from the packet during transmission from source to
   destination, then the packet itself is likely to be discarded by the
   receiver because it is not properly labeled.  In some cases, the
   receiver might receive the packet but associate an incorrect
   sensitivity label with the received data from the packet whose
   CALIPSO was stripped by an intermediate router or firewall.
   Associating an incorrect sensitivity label can cause the received
   information either to be handled as more sensitive than it really is
   ("upgrading") or as less sensitive than it really is ("downgrading"),
   either of which is problematic.

4.3.8.5.  Advice

   An intermediate system has no way to know a priori what environment
   it has been deployed into.  Even closed IP deployments generally use
   exactly the same commercial routers, security gateways, and firewalls
   that are used in the public Internet.

   Since operational problems result in environments where this option
   is needed if either the option is stripped or IPv6 packets containing
   this option are discarded, but no harm results if the option is
   carried in environments where it is not needed, the default
   configuration SHOULD NOT (a) modify or remove this IPv6 option or (b)
   discard an IPv6 packet because the IPv6 packet contains this option.

   Intermediate systems operating in environments that do not employ
   this option should discard packets that contain this option.

   For auditing reasons intermediate systems SHOULD be capable of
   logging the number of packets containing the CALIPSO on a per-
   interface basis.  Also, intermediate systems SHOULD be capable of
   discarding packets based on the CALIPSO presence as well as the
   CALIPSO values.

4.3.9.  SMF_DPD (Type=0x08)

4.3.9.1.  Uses

   This option is employed in the (experimental) Simplified Multicast
   Forwarding (SMF) for unique packet identification for IPv6 I-DPD, and
   as a mechanism to guarantee non-collision of hash values for
   different packets when H-DPD is used.  .

4.3.9.5.  Advice

   TBD.

4.3.10.  Home Address (Type=0xC9)

4.3.10.1.  Uses

   The Home Address option is used by a Mobile IPv6 node while away from
   home, to inform the recipient of the mobile node's home address.

4.3.10.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC6275].

4.3.10.3.  Specific Security Implications

   TBD.

4.3.10.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding IPv6 packets based on the presence of this option would
   break Mobile IPv6.

4.3.10.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should not discard IPv6 packets based on the
   presence of this option.

4.3.11.  Endpoint Identification (Type=0x8A)

4.3.11.1.  Uses

   The Endpoint Identification option was meant to be used with the
   Nimrod routing architecture [NIMROD-DOC], but has never seen
   widespread deployment.

4.3.11.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [NIMROD-DOC].

4.3.11.3.  Specific Security Implications

   TBD.

4.3.11.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

4.3.11.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should discard packets that contain this option.

4.3.12.  ILNP Nonce (Type=0x8B)

4.3.12.1.  Uses

   This option is employed by Identifier-Locator Network Protocol for
   IPv6 (ILNPv6) for providing protection against off-path attacks for
   packets when ILNPv6 is in use, and as a signal during initial
   network-layer session creation that ILNPv6 is proposed for use with
   this network-layer session, rather than classic IPv6.

4.3.12.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC6744].

4.3.12.3.  Specific Security Implications

   TBD.

   deployments.

4.3.12.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should not discard packets based on the presence
   of this option.

4.3.13.  Line-Identification Option (Type=0x8C)

4.3.13.1.  Uses

   This option is used by an Edge Router to identify the subscriber
   premises in scenarios where several subscriber premises may be
   logically connected to the same interface of an Edge Router.

4.3.13.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC6788].

4.3.13.3.  Specific Security Implications

   TBD.

4.3.13.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Since this option is meant to be employed in Router Solicitation
   messages, discarding packets based on the presence of this option at
   intermediate systems will result in no interoperability implications.

4.3.17.1.  Uses

   These options can be employed for performing RFC3692-style
   experiments.  It is only appropriate to use these values in
   explicitly configured experiments; they MUST NOT be shipped as
   defaults in implementations.
