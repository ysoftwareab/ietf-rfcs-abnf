Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing the Open Shortest Path
   First Routing Protocol.

   This memo is intended to update and possibly obsolete RFC 1850,
   however, it is designed to be backwards compatible. The functional
   differences between this memo and RFC 1850 are explained in Appendix
   B.

1 Overview

1.1 The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   This document describes aspects of the SNMPv2 Network Management
   Framework, which consists of a number of components.  They are:

      - An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

      - Mechanisms for describing and naming objects  and  events
        for  the purpose of management. The first version of this
        Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1
        and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212
        [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version, called SMIv2,
        is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and
        RFC 2580 [7].

      - Message protocols for transferring management
        information. The first version of the SNMP  message
        protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
        1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message protocol,
        which is not an Internet standards  track  protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906
        [10]. The third version of the message protocol is called
        SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and
        RFC 2574 [12].

      - Protocol operations for accessing management information.
        The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU
        formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157  [8]. A second
        set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1905 [13].

      - A set of fundamental applications described in  RFC  2573
        [14] and the view-based access control mechanism
        described in RFC 2575 [15].

1.2 The SMI, and Object Definitions



Expires October 2000                                          [Page 3]
Internet Draft                OSPFv2 MIB                   March, 2000


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
   SMIv2. A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through
   the appropriate translations.

1.3 Object Identification

   Objects in the SMI are defined by types, and are named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which is an administratively assigned name.
   The object type together with an object instance serves to
   uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object. For
   human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed
   the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

1.4 Textual Conventions

   Several data types in this MIB document are termed textual
   conventions. Textual conventions enhance the readability
   of the specification and can ease comparison with other
   specifications if appropriate. It should be noted that
   textual conventions have no effect on either the syntax nor
   the semantics of any managed objects. Objects defined in
   terms of one of these methods are always encoded by means
   of the rules that define the primitive type. Textual
   conventions are used for the convenience of readers and
   writers in pursuit of the goal of clear, concise, and
   unambiguous MIB documents.

1.5 Conceptual Row Creation

   For the benefit of row-creation in "conceptual" tables,
   DEFVAL (Default Value) clauses are included in the definitions in
   section 3, suggesting values which an agent should use for instances
   of variables which need to be created due to a Set-Request, but which
   are not specified in the Set-Request. DEFVAL clauses have not been
   specified for some objects which are read-only, implying that they
   are zeroed upon row creation.  These objects are of the SYNTAX
   Counter32 or Gauge32.

   For those objects not having a DEFVAL clause, both management
   stations and agents should heed the Robustness Principle of the
   Internet (see RFC-791):

   "be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you send"

   Therefor, management stations should include as many of these
   columnar objects as possible (e.g., all read-write objects) in a Set-

Internet Draft                OSPFv2 MIB                   March, 2000


   Request when creating a conceptual row. Agents should accept a Set-
   Request with as few of these columnar objects as they need (e.g., the
   minimum contents of a "row-creating" SET consists of those objects
   for which, as they cannot be intuited, no default is specified.).

1.6 Default Configuration

   OSPF is a powerful routing protocol, equipped with features to handle
   virtually any configuration requirement that might reasonably be
   found within an Autonomous System. With this power comes a fair
   degree of complexity, which the sheer number of objects in the MIB
   will attest to.  Care has therefore been taken, in constructing this
   MIB, to define default values for virtually every object, to minimize
   the amount of parameterization required in the typical case. That
   default configuration is as follows:

   Given the following assumptions:

      - IP has already been configured

      - The ifTable has already been configured

      - ifSpeed is estimated by the interface drivers

      - The OSPF Process automatically discovers all IP
        Interfaces and creates corresponding OSPF Interfaces

      - The OSPF Process automatically creates the Areas required
        for the Interfaces

   The simplest configuration of an OSPF process requires that:

      - The OSPF Process be Enabled.

   This can be accomplished with a single SET:

      ospfAdminStat := enabled.

   The configured system will have the following attributes:

      - The RouterID will be one of the IP addresses of the
        device

      - The device will be neither an Area Border Router nor an
        Autonomous System Border Router.

      - Every IP Interface, with or without an address, will be
        an OSPF Interface.

      - The AreaID of each interface will be 0.0.0.0, the
        Backbone.

Internet Draft                OSPFv2 MIB                   March, 2000



      - Authentication will be disabled

      - All Broadcast and Point to Point interfaces will be
        operational.  NBMA Interfaces require the configuration
        of at least one neighbor.

      - Timers on all direct interfaces will be:

          Hello Interval:        10 seconds
          Dead Timeout:          40 Seconds
          Retransmission:         5 Seconds
          Transit Delay:          1 Second
          Poll Interval:        120 Seconds

      - No direct links to hosts will be configured.

      - No addresses will be summarized

      - Metrics, being a measure of bit duration, are unambiguous
        and intelligent.

      - No Virtual Links will be configured.

2 Structure of this MIB

   This MIB is composed of the following sections:

      General Variables
      Area Data Structure
      Area Stub Metric Table
      Link State Database
      Address Range Table
      Host Table
      Interface Table
      Interface Metric Table
      Virtual Interface Table
      Neighbor Table
      Virtual Neighbor Table
      External Link State Database
      Aggregate Range Table
      Local Link State Database

   There exists a separate MIB for notifications ("traps"), which is
   entirely optional.

2.1 The Purposes of the sections in this MIB

2.1.1 General Variables

   The General Variables describe (as it may seem from the name)


Expires October 2000                                          [Page 6]
Internet Draft                OSPFv2 MIB                   March, 2000


   variables which are global to the OSPF Process.

2.1.2 Area Data Structure and Area Stub Metric Table

   The Area Data Structure describes all of the OSPF Areas that the
   router participates in. The Area Table includes data for NSSA
   translation.

   The Area Stub Metric Table describes the metrics advertised into
   a stub area by the default router(s).

2.1.3 Link State Database and External Link State Database

   The Link State Database is provided primarily to provide detailed
   information for network debugging.

2.1.4 Address Table and Host Tables

   The Address Range Table and Host Table are provided to view
   configured Network Summary and Host Route information.

2.1.5 Interface and Interface Metric Tables

   The Table and the Interface Metric Table together describe
   the various IP interfaces to OSPF. The metrics are placed in
   separate tables in order to simplify dealing with multiple types of
   service. The Interface table includes Link-Local (Opaque Type-9) LSA
   statistics.

2.1.6 Virtual Interface Table

   The Virtual Interface Table describes virtual links to the
   OSPF Process, similarly to the (non-Virtual)Interface Tables. This
   table includes Link-Local (Opaque Type-9) LSA statistics.

2.1.7 Neighbor and Virtual Neighbor Tables

   The Neighbor Table and the Virtual Neighbor Table describe the
   neighbors to the OSPF Process.

2.1.8 Local Link State Database Table and Virtual
      Local Link State Database Table

   The Local Link State Database Table and Virtual Local Link State
   Database Table are identical to the OSPF LSDB Table in
   format, but contain only Link-Local (Opaque Type-9) Link State
   Advertisements for non-virtual and virtual links.

--     the routing protocol to externalize its information. Most of
--     the variables (ipForwardDest, ipForwardMask, ipForwardPolicy,
--     ipForwardNextHop, ipForwardIfIndex, ipForwardType,
--     ipForwardProto, ipForwardAge, and ipForwardNextHopAS) are
--     defined there.

--     Those that leave some discretion are defined here.

--     ipCidrRouteProto is, of course, ospf (13).

--     ipCidrRouteAge is the time since the route was first calculated,
--     as opposed to the time since the last SPF run.

--     ipCidrRouteInfo is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER for use by the routing
--     protocol. The following values shall be found there depending
--     on the way the route was calculated.

--     it is an OSPF metric. For External Type 1 (comparable value)
--     routes, it is an OSPF metric plus the External Metric. For
--     external Type 2 (non-comparable value) routes, it is the
--     external metric.

--     ipCidrRouteMetric2 is, by definition, a secondary routing
--     metric. Therefore, it should be the metric that breaks a tie
--     among routes having equal metric1 values and the same
--     calculation rule. For intra-area, inter-area routes, and

4 OSPF Trap Overview

4.1 Introduction

   OSPF is an event driven routing protocol, where an event can be a
   change in an OSPF interface's link-level status, the expiration of an
   OSPF timer or the reception of an OSPF protocol packet. Many of the
   actions that OSPF takes as a result of these events will result in a
   change of the routing topology.

   As routing topologies become large and complex it is often difficult
   to locate the source of a topology change or unpredicted routing path
   by polling a large number or routers. Because of the difficulty of

Internet Draft                OSPFv2 MIB                   March, 2000


   polling a large number of devices, a more prudent approach is for
   devices to notify a network manager of potentially critical OSPF
   events using SNMP traps.

   This section defines a set of traps, objects and mechanisms to
   enhance the ability to manage IP internetworks which use OSPF as its
   IGP. It is an optional but very useful extension to the OSPF MIB.

4.2 Approach

   The mechanism for sending traps is straight-forward. When an
   exception event occurs, the application notifies the local agent who
   sends a trap to the appropriate SNMP management stations. The
   message includes the trap type and may include a list of trap
   specific variables. Section 5 gives the trap
   definitions which includes the variable lists. The router ID
   of the originator of the trap is included in the variable list
   so that the network manager may easily determine the source of the
   trap.

   To limit the frequency of OSPF traps, the following additional
   mechanisms are suggested.

4.3 Ignoring Initial Activity

   The majority of critical events occur when OSPF is enabled on a
   router, at which time the designated router is elected and neighbor
   adjacencies are formed.  During this initial period a potential
   flood of traps is unnecessary since the events are expected. To avoid
   unnecessary traps, a router should not originate expected OSPF
   interface related traps until two of that interface's dead timer
   intervals have elapsed. The expected OSPF interface traps are
   ospfIfStateChange, ospfVirtIfStateChange, ospfNbrStateChange,
   ospfVirtNbrStateChange, ospfTxRetranmit and ospfVirtIfTxRetransmit.
   Additionally, ospfMaxAgeLsa and ospfOriginateLsa traps should not be
   originated until two dead timer intervals have elapsed where the dead
   timer interval used should be the dead timer with the smallest value.

4.4 Throttling Traps

   The mechanism for throttling the traps is similar to the mechanism
   explained in RFC 1224 [24]. The basic premise of the throttling
   mechanism is that of a sliding window, defined in seconds and an
   upper bound on the number of traps that may be generated within this
   window. Note that unlike RFC 1224, traps are not sent to inform the
   network manager that the throttling mechanism has kicked in.

   A single window should be used to throttle all OSPF traps types
   except for the ospfLsdbOverflow and the ospfLsdbApproachingOverflow
   trap which should not be throttled.  For example, with a window time
   of 3, an upper bound of 3, and events to cause trap types 1,3,5 and 7

Internet Draft                OSPFv2 MIB                   March, 2000


   (4 traps within a 3 second period), the type 7 (the 4th) trap should
   not be generated.

   Appropriate values are 7 traps with a window time of 10 seconds.

4.5 One Trap Per OSPF Event

   Several of the traps defined in section 5 are
   generated as the result of finding an unusual condition while
   parsing an OSPF packet or a processing a timer event.  There
   may be more than one unusual condition detected while handling
   the event. For example, a link-state update packet may contain
   several retransmitted link-state advertisements (LSAs), or a
   retransmitted database description packet may contain several
   database description entries. To limit the number of traps and
   variables, OSPF should generate at most one trap per OSPF event.
   Only the variables associated with the first unusual condition
   should be included with the trap. Similarly, if more than
   one type of unusual condition is encountered while parsing the
   packet, only the first event will generate a trap.

4.6 Polling Event Counters

   Many of the tables in the OSPF MIB contain generalized event
   counters. By enabling the traps defined in this document a network
   manager can obtain more specific information about these events. A
   network manager may want to poll these event counters and enable
   specific OSPF traps when a particular counter starts increasing
   abnormally.

   The following table shows the relationship between the event counters
   defined in the OSPF MIB and the trap types defined in section x.

           "An ospfNbrStateChange trap signifies that
           there  has been a change in the state of a non-
           virtual OSPF neighbor. This trap should be
           generated when the neighbor state regresses
           (e.g., goes from Attempt or Full to 1-Way  or
           Down) or progresses to a terminal state (e.g.,
           2-Way or Full). When an neighbor transitions
           from or to Full on non-broadcast multi-access
           and broadcast networks, the trap should be gen-
           erated  by the designated router. A designated
           router transitioning to Down will be noted by
           ospfIfStateChange."

A TOS Support

   For backward compatibility with previous versions of the OSPF
   MIB specification, TOS-specific information has been retained
   in this document, though the TOS routing option has been
   deleted from OSPF [RFC 2178].

B Changes from RFC 1850

   This section documents the differences between this memo and RFC
   1850.

B.1 RFC 1583 Compatibility

   Added object ospfRFC1583Compatibility to ospfGeneralGroup
   to indicate support with "RFC 1583 Compatibility" This object
   has DEFVAL of "enabled".

B.2 OSPF Traffic Engineering Support

   Added object ospfTrafficEngineeringSuport to ospfGeneralGroup
   to indicate support of OSPF traffic engineering.

B.3 OSPF NSSA Enhancement Support

       (type-9) LSAs on virtual links.

B.7 Miscellaneous

   Various sections, have been moved and or modified for clarity.
   Most of these changes are semantic in nature, and include,
   but are not limited to:

      -The OSPF Overview section's format was revised. Unneeded
       information was removed. Removed information includes OSPF TOS
       default values.

      -The Trap Overview section's format and working were revised.
       Unneeded information was removed.

      -Modified the DESCRIPTION clause of "Status" "TEXTUAL-CONVENTION"
       for clarity

      -The updates section was moved from the Overview to an appendix

      -Updated "REFERENCE" clauses in all objects, as needed

      -Modified the SEQUENCE of the OspfIfTable to reflect the true
       order of the objects in the Table

      -Modified the DESCRIPTION clause of ospfIfAuthKey due to security
       concerns, and to increase clarity

   Changed the "MAX-ACCESS" clause of
   "ospfHostStatus" in "ospfHostTable" to "read-create"

C Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
