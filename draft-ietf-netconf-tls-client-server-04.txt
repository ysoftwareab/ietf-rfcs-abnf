             YANG Groupings for TLS Clients and TLS Servers
                draft-ietf-netconf-tls-client-server-04

Abstract

   This document defines three YANG modules: the first defines groupings
   for a generic TLS client, the second defines groupings for a generic
   TLS server, and the third defines common identities and groupings
   used by both the client and the server.  It is intended that these
   groupings will be used by applications using the TLS protocol.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines three YANG [RFC7950] modules: the first defines
   a grouping for a generic TLS client, the second defines a grouping
   for a generic TLS server, and the third defines identities and
   groupings common to both the client and the server (TLS is defined in
   [RFC5246]).  It is intended that these groupings will be used by
   applications using the TLS protocol.  For instance, these groupings
   could be used to help define the data model for an HTTPS [RFC2818]
   server or a NETCONF over TLS [RFC7589] based server.

   The client and server YANG modules in this document each define one
   grouping, which is focused on just TLS-specific configuration, and
   specifically avoids any transport-level configuration, such as what
   ports to listen-on or connect-to.  This enables applications the
   opportunity to define their own strategy for how the underlying TCP
   connection is established.  For instance, applications supporting
   NETCONF Call Home [RFC8071] could use the grouping for the TLS parts
   it provides, while adding data nodes for the TCP-level call-home
   configuration.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data models is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Braces "{" and "}" enclose feature names, and indicate that the
      named feature must be present for the subtree to be present.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  The TLS Client Model

   The TLS client model presented in this section contains one YANG
   grouping, to just configure the TLS client, omitting, for instance,
   any configuration for which IP address or port the client should
   connect to.

   This grouping references data nodes defined by the keystore model
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].  For instance, a reference to the
   keystore model is made to indicate which trusted CA certificate a
   client should use to authenticate the server's certificate.

2.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram presents the data model for the grouping
   defined in the ietf-tls-client module.  Please see Section 1.2 for
   tree diagram notation.

2.2.  Example Usage

   This section shows how it would appear if the tls-client-grouping
   were populated with some data.  This example is consistent with the
   examples presented in Section 2.2 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

<!-- hypothetical example, as groupings don't have instance data -->
<tls-client xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tls-client">

  <!-- how this client will authenticate itself to the server -->
  <client-auth>
    <certificate>builtin-idevid-cert</certificate>
  </client-auth>

  <!-- which certificates will this client trust -->
  <server-auth>
    <pinned-ca-certs>deployment-specific-ca-certs</pinned-ca-certs>
    <pinned-server-certs>explicitly-trusted-client-certs</pinned-server-certs>
  </server-auth>

</tls-client>

2.3.  YANG Model

   This YANG module has a normative references to [RFC6991] and
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

3.  The TLS Server Model

   The TLS server model presented in this section contains one YANG
   grouping, for just the TLS-level configuration, omitting, for
   instance, configuration for which ports to open to listen for
   connections on.

   This grouping references data nodes defined by the keystore model
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].  For instance, a reference to the
   keystore model is made to indicate which certificate a server should
   present.

   The following tree diagram presents the data model for the grouping
   defined in the ietf-tls-server module.  Please see Section 1.2 for
   tree diagram notation.

4.  The TLS Common Model

   The TLS common model presented in this section contains identities
   and groupings common to both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The hello-
   params-grouping can be used to configure the list of TLS algorithms
   permitted by the TLS client or TLS server.  The lists of algorithms
   are ordered such that, if multiple algorithms are permitted by the
   client, the algorithm that appears first in its list that is also

   permitted by the server is used for the TLS transport layer
   connection.  The ability to restrict the the algorithms allowed is
   provided in this grouping for TLS clients and TLS servers that are
   capable of doing so and may serve to make TLS clients and TLS servers
   compliant with security policies.

   Features are defined for algorithms that are OPTIONAL or are not
   widely supported by popular implementations.  Note that the list of
   algorithms is not exhaustive.

4.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram presents the data model for the grouping
   defined in the ietf-tls-common module.  Please see Section 1.2 for
   tree diagram notation.

   module: ietf-tls-common

     grouping hello-params-grouping
       +---- tls-versions
       |  +---- tls-version*   identityref
       +---- cipher-suites
          +---- cipher-suite*   identityref

4.2.  Example Usage

   This section shows how it would appear if the transport-params-
   grouping were populated with some data.

   <!-- hypothetical example, as groupings don't have instance data -->
   <hello-params
      xmlns:tlscmn="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tls-common">
     <tls-versions>
       <tls-version>tlscmn:tls-1.1</tls-version>
       <tls-version>tlscmn:tls-1.2</tls-version>
     </tls-versions>
     <cipher-suites>
       <cipher-suite>tlscmn:dhe-rsa-with-aes-128-cbc-sha</cipher-suite>
       <cipher-suite>tlscmn:rsa-with-aes-128-cbc-sha</cipher-suite>
       <cipher-suite>tlscmn:rsa-with-3des-ede-cbc-sha</cipher-suite>
     </cipher-suites>
   </hello-params>

4.3.  YANG Model

   This YANG module has a normative references to [RFC2246], [RFC4346],
   [RFC4492], [RFC5246], [RFC5288], and [RFC5289].

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document are designed to be accessed
   via YANG based management protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS) with mutual
   authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC6536] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the modules defined in this document only define groupings,
   these considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules
   that use these groupings.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG modules that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /: The entire data tree of all the groupings defined in this draft
         is sensitive to write operations.  For instance, the addition
         or removal of references to keys, certificates, trusted
         anchors, etc., can dramatically alter the implemented security
         policy.  However, no NACM annotations are applied as the data
         SHOULD be editable by users other than a designated 'recovery
         session'.

   Some of the readable data nodes in the YANG modules may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      NONE

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      NONE

Appendix A.  Change Log

A.1.  server-model-09 to 00

   o  This draft was split out from draft-ietf-netconf-server-model-09.

   o  Noted that '0.0.0.0' and '::' might have special meanings.

A.2.  00 to 01

   o  Renamed "keychain" to "keystore".

A.3.  01 to 02

   o  Removed the groupings containing transport-level configuration.
      Now modules contain only the transport-independent groupings.

   o  Filled in previously incomplete 'ietf-tls-client' module.

   o  Added cipher suites for various algorithms into new 'ietf-tls-
      common' module.

A.4.  02 to 03

   o  Added a 'must' statement to container 'server-auth' asserting that
      at least one of the various auth mechanisms must be specified.

   o  Fixed description statement for leaf 'trusted-ca-certs'.

A.5.  03 to 04

   o  Updated title to "YANG Groupings for TLS Clients and TLS Servers"

   o  Updated leafref paths to point to new keystore path

   o  Changed the YANG prefix for ietf-tls-common from 'tlscom' to
      'tlscmn'.

   o  Added TLS protocol verions 1.0 and 1.1.

   o  Made author lists consistent
