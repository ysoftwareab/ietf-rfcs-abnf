      Using CLA-Specific Endpoint IDs to identify Channel Endpoint
                      draft-loiseau-dtn-cla-eid-00

Abstract

   This document describes a specific EID scheme namely "cla" that meets
   the requirement for endpoint identification as defined in the Bundle
   Protocol and that also uniquely identifies a Convergence Layer
   Adapter "channel" and is, in essence, an interface identifier (IID).
   Such IID is comprised of two parts: a "cla-identifier" part that
   identifies a specific convergence layer adapter, and a "cla-
   parameters" part that is a cla-specific list of parameter describing
   a single channel managed by this convergence layer adapter.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a specific EID scheme namely "cla" that meets
   the requirement for endpoint identification as defined in the Bundle
   Protocol[I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis] and that is managed by convergence layer
   adapters (CLA).  Such EID of the scheme "cla" is called an Interface
   Identifier (IID) and within the context of the bundle protocol
   operation is used to identify channel endpoints.  A Bundle Protocol
   Interface represents the abstraction of an underlying transport
   channel, managed by a CLA, and that provides the set of services
   described in section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis].  A convergence
   layer adapter that conforms to this specification SHALL provide the
   two additional services:

   1.  egress: MUST provide an IID for every channel that is open and
       for which an interface is available for sending bundles.

   2.  ingress: If applicable, MAY provide an IID identifying the local
       Bundle Node for every channel that is open.

2.  Convention used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  IID: Scheme Syntax and Rules

   The general syntax of an IID is:

   cla:<CLA-NAME>:<CLA-SPECIFIC-PART>

   CLA-NAME is the name of the convergence layer adapter that can parse
   or generate this IID.

   CLA-SPECIFIC-PART is the convergence layer specific part that
   identifies a specific cla channel.  This part must be unambiguous and
   can be automatically guessed by any peer implementing this CLA and
   that knows the parameter for this channel.

4.  CLA Additional Services

4.1.  IID as an Egress Identifier

   Convergence layer adapters provide a service interface used to send
   and receive Bundle with other Bundle Nodes.  In this context, an IID
   identifies an interface in a way that is unambiguous meaning that two
   different interfaces should never have the same IID.  IIDs being
   transport-layer interface identifier MUST exactly map to an
   underlying transport channel.  Such IID is, in effect, used to
   identify the egress part of an interface.

   Every Bundle that is schedule for forwarding and whose destination
   EID matches an egress-IID must be directly forwarded to the
   underlying matching transport channel.

4.2.  IID as an Ingress Identifier

   When applicable, a bundle node may be addressable in a way that is
   specific to a convergence layer adapter.  For instance with
   stcp[I-D.burleigh-dtn-stcp] each bundle node can be uniquely
   identified with its pair {ip address, tcp port} and other bundle
   nodes may use an IID to address bundles to it.  In some other case,
   it may not be possible to create such an identifier, for instance
   with a USB cla (where the transport channel is a folder in a USB
   drive), it wouldn't really make much sense to have a cla-specific
   address that would be automatically derivable by other bundle node.
   Such IID is, in effect, used to identify the ingress part of an
   interface.

   If it is applicable to derive such ingress-IID to address the local
   bundle node instance, each bundle that is received and whose
   destination field is this IID should be processed for local delivery.
