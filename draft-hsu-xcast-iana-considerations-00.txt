1.0 Introduction

   XCAST (Explicit Multi-Unicast) is an experimental multicasting
   protocol for efficient small group communications. The XCAST protocol
   [basic] and related protocols have been proposed as Internet-Drafts
   (ID) over the past few years. These IDs describe our experiences in
   building various small group communication protocols and what we have
   found to be the most important criteria of small group communication
   protocol design.

   XCAST experimentation is quite active, and multiple implementations
   have been developed by several researchers, hackers and companies
   around the world [bcp]. These results have demonstrated the
   effectiveness of the XCAST6 design, the interoperability among
   different platforms and the practical use of XCAST protocols.

   Given the growing interest in XCAST and the need to conduct more
   experimentation and testing among a large group of users, developers
   and industry participants, we would like to accelerate the deployment
   of XCAST-aware routers. According to RFC 3692 [rfc3692], we believe
   that experimental values could be obtained through IESG approval. The
   IANA assignments requested in this document represent the minimum set
   we believe is needed by the XCAST research community at this time.
   This document requires IANA allocations for new types and values of
   IPv6 headers which are defined in the XCAST protocol.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [rfc2119].
   Allocation policy names Specification Required, IETF Consensus
   Action, and Designated Expert are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2434 [rfc2434]


2. Request for IANA Resources

   The XCAST protocol requires IANA allocations for a new type of
   multicast address, a routing type of IPv6 routing header, an option
   type of Destination Option header and an option header of IPv6 Hope-
   by-Hop Options header.

2.1 Multicast Address for ALL_XCAST_NODES

   As defined in section 9.3.1 of [basic], IANA shall assign a new type
   of multicast address, e.g,: ALL_XCAST_NODES (ff05::10), for
   identifying the destination address of IPv6 header utilized by the
   XCAST protocol.

2.2 Routing Type of IPv6 Routing Header

   As defined in section 9.3.2.1 of [basic], IANA shall assign a new
   routing type, e.g., RouteType=XCAST, for identifying the message of
   IPv6 routing header utilized by the XCAST protocol.

2.3 Option Type of IPv6 Destination Option Header

   As defined in section 9.3.2.2 of [basic], IANA shall assign a new
   option type, e.g., Option Type=Ports, for identifying the message of
   IPv6 Destination Options Header utilized by the XCAST protocol. Note
   that, the first three bits must be "010" to indicate that the packet
   must be discarded if the option is unknown and that the option can be
   changed en-route.

2.4 Option Type of IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options Header

   As defined in section 11.3 of [basic], IANA shall assign a new option
   type, e.g., Option Type=XCAST, for identifying the message of IPv6
   Hop-by-Hop Options Header utilized by the semi-permeable tunneling
   mechanism of the XCAST protocol. Note that, the first two bits must
   be "00" to ensure that routers that cannot recognize XCAST can treat
   the XCAST datagram as a normal IPv6 datagram and forward it toward
   the destination in the IPv6 header.
