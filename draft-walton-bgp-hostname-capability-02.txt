                draft-walton-bgp-hostname-capability-02

Abstract

   In this document, we introduce a new BGP capability that allows the
   advertisemnet of a BGP speaker's hostname.

Internet-Draft         Hostname Capability for BGP          January 2016


1.  Introduction

   BGP is increasingly used inside the data center.  Due to the sheer
   scale of devices involved, simplifying troubleshooting BGP would be
   very useful.  One simple way to ease the troubleshooting is to
   display the hostname of the speaker in addition to the speaker's IP
   address.  This document defines a new BGP capability that allows the
   exchange of a speaker's FQDN.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  FQDN Capability

   The FQDN Capability is a new BGP capability [RFC5492].  The
   Capability Code for this capability is specified in the IANA
   Considerations section of this document.  The Capability Length field
   of this capability is variable.  The Capability Value field consists
   of the following:

                +--------------------------------+
                |  Hostname Length (1 octet)     |
                +--------------------------------+
                |  Hostname (variable)           |
                +--------------------------------+
                |  Domain Name Length (1 octet)  |
                +--------------------------------+
                |  Domain Name (variable)        |
                +--------------------------------+

      Hostname Length:

         The number of characters in the Hostname

      Hostname:

         The hostname encoded via UTF-8

      Domain Name Length:

         The number of characters in the Domain Name

      Domain Name:

         The domain name encoded via UTF-8

Internet-Draft         Hostname Capability for BGP          January 2016


4.  Operation

   The FQDN Capability SHOULD only be used for displaying the hostname
   and/or domain name of a speaker in order to make troubleshooting
   easier.  The hostname and domain name used are assumed to be
   extracted from the hostname and domain name set on the device.  While
   there are other ways to potentially obtain the same information,
   having standard BGP show commands use the hostname makes the use of
   this option quite powerful.

   An example of showing hostname in various displays is show below in
   the output of the summary of BGP peering relationships, the first
   being the typical display today, and the second the display when
   displaying hostnames is enabled:
