Internet-Draft        Broadband Network Transition          October 2010


1.  Introduction

   As we known, broadband subscriber is one of the largest parts of the
   Internet participants.  It is significant to migrate them to IPv6,
   which will seem as an important step on IPv6 development.  This
   document describes an IPv6 transition guide for a large-scale
   broadband network with Layer 2 accessing.  And it will focus on the
   cases that the network infrastructure is large and widely covered,
   and the new subscriber's number is very large and is still increasing
   very fast.

   In some cases, the broadband network is serving several dozen
   millions of subscribers with more than 20% annual increases in next
   few years.  It is predicted that after the IPv4 addresses allocated
   by IANA are exhausted, the broadband users in these cases will still
   keep a high increasing rate, which will bring unprecedented pressure
   to not only the development of broadband services, but also the
   development of Internet.

   Due to IPv4 addresses shortage, the network infrastructure and
   Internet services will no doubt to migrate to IPv6 eventually.  And
   it is also our final goal.  However, IPv6-based new services and
   applications are few and far between.

   During the IPv6 transition, large-scale broadband network basically
   should take a smooth transition strategy because of the inactive IPv6
   industrial chain.  The first rule could be customer-oriented which
   means any changes to the network infrastructure should guarantee the
   users' experience.  At the same time, the transition technology and
   strategy should be consistent with the future direction in order to
   protect the investments and maintain the network stability.  And the
   technologies and solutions should be compatible with the existing
   broadband service access method and provisioning method.

   This document is aimed to identify the pros and cons of all possible
   solutions in every part of the broadband network with considering its
   features.  And it also provides the applicable scenarios for each
   solution.

2.  Terminologies

   Backbone network:  Backbone network interconnects various regional
               broadband networks, providing a path for the exchange of
               information between different networks.

   Regional Broadband Network:  Regional broadband network interconnects
               the central offices in a geographical area.

   L2 Access Network:  L2 Access Network is the broadband access
               infrastructure which is a Layer 2 network.

   Customer Premises Network:  Customer Premises Network will contain
               one or more terminal equipment devices possibly
               interconnected by a customer premises network.

   POP:        Internet point of presence, POP, is the access point to
               the backbone network for regional broadband network.

   MPLS PE routers:  Provider edge router in a MPLS backbone network.

   BRAS:       Broadband Remote Access Server, BRAS, is the aggregation
               point for the subscriber traffic.  It provides
               aggregation capabilities between the Access Network and
               the Metro Network.  Beyond aggregation, it is also the
               injection point for access authentication, policy
               management and IP QoS.

   CR:         Core Router in a regional broadband network is the egress
               router of the regional broadband network and connecting
               to a POP of the backbone in upstream and connecting to
               BRASs for downstream.

   SR:         Service Router, SR, is the access nodes for different
               services providers (e.g.  Internet Contents Provider).

   AR:         Aggregation Router is connected to CRs and provide
               traffic aggregation for BRASs in a large-scale regional
               broadband network.

   DSLAM:      Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer, DSLAM, is the
               access node for Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL)
               subscribers.

   OLT:        An optical line termination (OLT) is a device which
               serves as the endpoint of a passive optical network
               (PON).

   CPE:        Customer Premises Equipment, CPE, is the edge of Customer
               Premises Network.  In this document, there are two types
               of CPEs, Routing mode CPE and Bridging mode CPE.

   User End:   In this document, we consider the user end is a PC with a
               popular operating system like Windows, MAC OS, or Linux.


3.  High Level Architecture

   In this section, a High Level Broadband Architecture with layer 2
   (L2) access network is shown in Figure 1.  There are basically five
   parts in this architecture, Customer Premises Network, Layer 2 Access
   Network, Regional Broadband Network, Backbone and the Internet.  We
   don't discuss the physical layer infrastructures in this document.
   (e.g.Main Distribution Frame (MDF), and Optical Network Terminal
   (ONT)).

    Figure 1: High Level Broadband Architecture with L2 Access network

   In general, IP backbone and MPLS-enabled Layer 3 IP backbone (to
   simplify discuss, we call it "MPLS backbone" in this document)
   [RFC3031] are two major types of backbone for long distance
   transmission in the large scale broadband network.  We classified two

Internet-Draft        Broadband Network Transition          October 2010


   types of MPLS backbone here, the combined backbone forwarding both
   the non-labeled packets by IP switching and the labeled packets by
   label switching (MPLS+IP backbone), or a MPLS backbone with label
   switching only.

   In the Regional Broadband Network, Metro Core Router (CR) is
   connected to IP backbone, MPLS+IP backbone or both IP backbone and
   MPLS backbone.  In most situations, Broadband Remote Access Server
   (BRAS) is directly connected to CR, while in some cases, BRAS could
   be connected to an Aggregation Router (AR) that connected to CR.
   Service Router (SR) is basically the access nodes for different
   services.  As this document is focus on the IPv6 transition of
   broadband service, it does not discuss about the transition of SR.

   BRAS acts as the aggregation point for the subscriber traffic.  It
   provides aggregation capabilities between the L2 Access Network and
   the Regional Broadband Network.  Beyond aggregation, it is also the
   injection point for access authentication, policy management and IP
   QoS.

   The access network in this architecture is a L2 network.  It is from
   the BRAS to the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) located at the edge
   of customer premises network.  The most popular access method in this
   architecture currently could be PPPoE [RFC2516].  In theory, the
   devices in the access network have no needs to be IPvX protocol
   aware.

   Note that although the IPoE access method may be using the same L2
   access network, the discussion of IPv6 transition with IPoE is out-
   of-scope in this document.  And it does not consider the transition
   from a layer 2 access network to a layer 3 one as well.

   This document will focus on the IPv6 transition of the Backbone
   Network and the Regional Broadband Network in the architecture above
   [Figure 1].  And it will also discuss how to provide IPv6 service for
   broadband subscribers in such kind of architecture.


4.  Overview of Solutions

   This document describes the IPv6 transition solutions and related
   technologies for the Use Case for Large-Scale Broadband Network.
   [I-D.huang-v6ops-v4v6tran-bb-usecase] By analysing the features of
   the case, The following factors make the networks' and services' IPv6
   transition complicated and difficult:

   o  Large number of broadband subscribers and their terminals with
      diverse IPv6 capabilities;



Yang, et al.             Expires April 23, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Broadband Network Transition          October 2010


   o  Large number of network devices with diverse IPv6 capabilities;

   o  Various types of the Internet services and applications have
      diverse IPv6 capabilities and they will not migrated to IPv6
      synchronized.

   During the IPv6 transition, the user experience should be guaranteed.
   So, it is important to take the terminal into consideration besides
   the networking issues.

   Moreover, in order to migrate both of the network infrastructures and
   the Internet services smoothly, it is significant to select the
   proper technologies at each point of time on the IPv6 roadmap
   according to different network scenarios.

   Because the global IPv4 addresses is depleting, and most of the
   Internet contents and applications are not ready yet, carrier graded
   NAT44 technologies and Large Scale NAT devices (LSN) may be deployed
   in the network during the initial stage of the IPv6 transition.  So,
   the issues that are brought from NAT44 technology itself and the
   interoperating with other IPv6 transition technologies should be
   considered.


5.  Transition For the Backbone Network

   According to the architecture in Figure 1 above, there are three
   possible backbones in a large-scale broadband network:

   o  There is an IP backbone only;

   o  There is a MPLS+IP combined backbone;

   o  There is an IP backbone and a MPLS backbone.

   The discussion on backbone will focus onthe scenario that there is an
   IP backbone and a MPLS backbone separately.  When there is an IP
   backbone only, it can use the Dual-stack solution or the IPv6
   solutions.  And when there is a MPLS+IP combined backbone, the
   solutions are similar.  It can use the Dual-stack solution or the
   IPv6 solutions with IP-based switching; alternatively, it use the 6PE
   solution with labeled switching for the IPv6 traffic.

   Basically, there are three main ways for the transition of backbone
   network:

   o  Dual-stack IP Backbone




Yang, et al.             Expires April 23, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        Broadband Network Transition          October 2010


   o  IPv6-Only Backbone

   o  6PE in MPLS Backbone

5.1.  Dual-stack IP Backbone

   The Dual-stack IP Backbone Solution includes two implementation
   options, building a completely new Dual-Stack IP backbone or
   upgrading the existing routers in the IP backbone to Dual-Stack by
   enabling IPv6.  Technically, the main idea is carrying both the IPv6
   and IPv4 traffic on one backbone.  Except the management issue and
   engineering cost, there may be little difference on technical aspect.
   The upgrade implementation could be incrementally to reduce the risk
   on each Internet point of presence (POP), but it can not avoid the
   risk on provider (P) routers.  In the new-built implementation, the
   new POPs and P routers are sperately with the existing backbone.
   Therefore, the risk of upgrading the P routers, which is considerable
   high, will be avoided.  The upgrade implementation will be much more
   complicated, and this section will focus on it.

   Upgrading the existing backbone to a Dual-stack IP backbone requires
   enable IPv6 on the all the routers and support both IPv4 and IPv6
   routing protocols.  In some cases, the routers may upgrade to a new
   software and hardware version to support a better performance and
   functionality.  So, the changes will contains two parts, devices
   upgrade and reconfiguration.  Figure 2 presents the architecture
   after the upgrade implementation.

                     Figure 2: Dual-stack IP Backbone

   Generally, the pros and cons of this solution are:

   Pros:

   o  According the the use CASE [I-D.huang-v6ops-v4v6tran-bb-usecase],
      most of existing routers have IPv6 capability already (but not



Yang, et al.             Expires April 23, 2011                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        Broadband Network Transition          October 2010


      enabled).  To support IPv6, it only needs to make some
      configurations or upgrade the software version.  It does not need
      the extra engineering cost for the new infrastructure.  It is no
      need to build or expand the existing facilities like power, air
      conditioning and transmission infrastructures, which may take a
      long engineering period.

   o  The existing IP backbone is usually covering a widely area
      already.  So, this solution is flexible and can conduct a rapid
      deployment of IPv6 services anywhere it covered.

   o  The upgraded IP backbone is compatible with the existing IPv4
      traffic and the new IPv6 traffic.  There is no extra new backbone
      which will lead a large amount of extra management cost.

   o  The upgraded dual-stack backbone can be upgraded to IPv6-only by
      turning off the IPv4 after the IPv4 traffic is disappeared.

   Cons:

   o  Until now, the routers in the IP backbone that supported Dual-
      stack will usually route IPv4 and IPv6 traffic separately based on
      the IPv4 routing table and the IPv6 one respectively.  The router
      may have challenges for the performance and stability after they
      are upgraded to dual-stack, for example, the size of routing
      table, routing lookup/forwarding capability and routing
      convergence capability due to the sharing of resources.

   o  There is lack of technical and management experience of large-
      scale changing in a high volume traffic backbone, even though the
      change is very little.

   o  There is a high risk to upgrade the P router to dual-stack because
      of its high volume traffic.  Any fault (hardware or software) may
      lead a significant impact to the existing services.  And these
      impacts is difficult to predict.

5.2.  IPv6-Only Backbone

   It seems impossible to upgrade the existing IPv4 backbone to a native
   IPv6 backbone.  This section will discuss a solution of building a
   new IPv6-only backbone network and keeping the original IPv4
   infrastructure unchanged.  There is only IPv6 routing in the new
   backbone, and the IPv4 traffic will be kept going through the legacy
   IPv4 backbone.  Figure 3 presents the architecture of co-existing of
   IPv4 backbone and IPv6 backbone.

                        Figure 3: New IPv6 Backbone

   Pros:

   o  In line with the future network; It is a one-step solution and no
      need the second step which will also brings the risks (e.g. dual-
      stack backbone upgrade to IPv6 only);

   o  Nearly with no impact on the existing IPv4 backbone and the
      services on it;

   o  Simple to maintain two physically separated infrastructures
      compared with a complex dual-stack network with two logical
      network.

   Cons:

   o  The cost of building a new backbone is considerable high and the
      engineering cycle could be very long.

   o  If the IPv6 services are still very few, the subscribers' IPv4
      traffic will not be forwarded to the new IPv6 backbone.  The
      inefficiency of the new IPv6 backbone could be a waste.  Moreover,
      there may be a separate network operation and management cost for
      the new backbone.

5.3.  6PE on MPLS Backbone

   The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] is a popular
   networking technology that forwards packets by label switching
   instead of by IP switching.  In this solution, the provider edge (PE)
   routers are dual-stack.  The egress routers of the regional broadband
   network are connected to the PE router via a normal interface.  The
   IPv6 routing distribution between two IPv6 enabled PE routers is done
   via Multiprotocol iBGP (MP-iBGP).  The iBGP sessions distribute the
   IPv6 prefixes and the associated MPLS label.  This is known as IPv6+
   label and is encoded according to [RFC3107].  The communication of
   IPv6 is achieved by the label switched path (LSP) among PE

                      Figure 4: 6PE in MPLS backbone

   Pros:

   o  6PE technology [RFC4798] is relatively mature compared to other
      tunnel technology in backbone.

   o  There is no need to make changes on P routers which the LSP goes
      through.  Only the PE router connecting to IPv6-enabled networks
      needs to implement Dual-stack and make some corresponding
      configurations for 6PE.  The reengineering cost and risk of this
      kind of changes is comparable low.

   o  Little impact to the existing services: There is little impact to
      the existing services.  It is similar to the existing MPLS network
      is carrying a new service with a new label.

   o  According to the use case [I-D.huang-v6ops-v4v6tran-bb-usecase],
      the MPLS backbone covers a widely area already which means it can
      provide IPv6 servces with a rapid deployment when there is an IPv6
      demand in some regional broadband networks.  Therefore, this
      solution is flexible and supporting incremental deployment.

   Cons:

   o  This solution changes the original designed purpose of the MPLS
      network which is normally used to carry VPN traffic and usually
      light load. 6PE brings the public traffic in to the MPLS
      infrastructure.  When the this kind of traffic grows, there may be
      significant to the existing services.

   o  Unable to deploy QoS policy for IPv6 traffic.

   o  It may bring some inconvenient for troubleshooting.

5.4.  Conclusion

   The 6PE solution may be applicable in the IPv6 initial stage while
   the most traffic is still IPv4 in the backbone and there is a demand
   for the rapid deployment of IPv6 service.

   The Dual-stack solution may be applicable to the intermediate stage
   when IPv6 traffic is relatively large.  And for the network devices,
   the Dual-stack capability, performance, and stability need to be
   reasonable high enough to support two IP stacks.

   The native IPv6 solution may be suitable to the latter phase of IPv6
   transition with most of the services being IPv6 capable.  It can also
   be upgraded from the Dual-stack backbone by turning off the IPv4
   after the IPv4 traffic is disappeared.


6.  Transition of Regional IP Network

   According to the use case [I-D.huang-v6ops-v4v6tran-bb-usecase], The
   Overview of the solutions in the Regional Broadband Network can be
   summarized into the following three types:

   o  Providing IPv6 service by Large-scale upgrading the existing
      regional broadband network infrastructure;

   o  Providing IPv6 service by little changes on the existing regional
      broadband network infrastructure;

   o  Providing IPv6 service by building a completely new IPv6 regional
      broadband network infrastructure;

Internet-Draft        Broadband Network Transition          October 2010


       Figure 5: Overview of Solutions in Regional Broadband Network

   In each transition solution of regional broadband network, it can
   connect to one of the following backbone described in section 3.1??:

   o  Connect to the Dual-stack IP backbone;

   o  Connect to the IPv6-only backbone for IPv6 traffic and to the
      existing IP backbone for IPv4 traffic if it has;

   o  Connect to the 6PE on the MPLS backbone for IPv6 traffic and to
      the existing IP backbone for IPv4 traffic if it has.

   Some less possible transition solutions haven't been listed above:

   o  Upgrade the existing regional broadband network to IPv6-only; It
      will lead to a huge influence to existing network and services.

   o  Create a new regional broadband network with native IPv6 CRs and
      Dual-Stack BRASs; It has very low possibilities because if we
      create a new regional broadband network to provide dual-stack
      service with new dual-stack BRAS, the simplest solution will be
      let the new CRs to be dual-stack too.  If the new CRs are IPv6-
      only, they need other transition technologies working together
      which seem to be more complicated.

   o  Create a new regional broadband network with Dual-stack CRs and
      native IPv6 BRASs; It also has very low possibilities and the
      reason is same as the above one.

   In the following sections, the technical solutions based on the
   scenarios in Figure 5 are discussed.  Although there may be many
   technical options in each scenario, the discussion will focus on one
   of them.

   The possible solutions referred to Figure 5 that we will discuss:

   o  Solution 1: Dual-Stack and L2TP

   o  Solution 2: Dual-Stack over IPv6 - DS-lite

   o  Solution 3: Dual-Stack over IPv4 - 6rd

   o  Solution 4: IPv6 and NAT64

   In this document, it is considering that the CPE is basically
   purchased by customers.  In the PPPoE dial-up cases, most users
   dial-up from PC, but there is some deployed a Home Gateway (e.g.



Yang, et al.             Expires April 23, 2011                [Page 14]

   WLAN AP) by themselves and set up an automatically dial-up from it.
   Until now, most terminals, including PCs and CPEs, will still be
   IPv4-only.  Although most PC operating system (OS) declared that they
   already supported IPv6, there is still a problem on supporting PPPoE
   with IPv6.  Not only the most widely used OS, Windows(TM) XP, doesn't
   support PPPoE with IPv6, but also nearly all CPEs in the market does
   not support this function.  This problem will be a significant
   bottleneck of the development of IPv6 broadband with PPPoE access
   method.

6.1.  Dual-Stack and L2TP

   In this solution, both the CRs and BRASs will be transition to Dual-
   stack by upgrading or replacing the existing devices.  However, there
   are so many different BRASs with diverse IPv6 capability in a large-
   scale broadband network.  So there is a possibility that some BRASs
   cannot upgrade to Dual-stack and support PPPoE with IPv6.

   In the Figure 6 below, there are two scenarios in this solution.

   o  Scenario 1: A Dual-stack or IPv6 terminal accessing to a Dual-
      stack BRAS.

   o  Scenario 2: A Dual-stack or IPv6 terminal accessing to a legacy
      IPv4-only BRAS.

                  Scenario1            Scenario2


                 Figure 6: Dual-stack Transition Solution

   The Scenario 1 is very simple.  But the routing CPE at the edge of
   customer premises network need to be upgraded to support IPv6 and
   PPPoE with IPv6.  And the PC operation system (OS) also need to

Internet-Draft        Broadband Network Transition          October 2010


   support PPPoE with IPv6.

   The Scenario 2 is a little bit complicated.  The BRAS which the
   subscriber is connecting to is not support IPv6 and PPPoE with IPv6.
   So, one possible solution could be terminating the point-to-point
   protocol (PPP) [RFC1661] link at a remote Dual-stack BRAS.  A tunnel
   technology like Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) [RFC2661] can be
   used in this scenario.  Other technologies could be an alternative.
   But considering the device capabilities and the maturity of the
   technology, the following discussion will focus on the solution that
   Dual-stack network with L2TP to provide Dual-stack services.
   [SeeFigure 7]

         Figure 7: The L2TP Solution in partly Dual-Stack network

   Although tunnel technologies can solve this problem, it is considered
   as a temporary solution.  The legacy IPv4-only BRASs will be replaced
   eventually.

   For the Dual-stack service, IPv4 address is still need to allocate to
   terminal.  After the IPv4 addresses exhaustion, Dual-stack BRASs
   could allocate private IPv4 addresses for broadband subscribers, and
   a NAT44 Large Scale NAT (LSN) [I-D.kuarsingh-lsn-deployment] device
   will be deployed to provide IPv4 NAT services for subscribers who are
   using private IPv4 addresses.

   The operating system (OS) of the new subscriber is recommended to
   support PPPoE with IPv6.  Third-party dial-up software could be
   provided if the OS is not support PPPoE with IPv6.

   The routing mode CPE of new subscriber is required to support PPPoE
   with IPv6.  Otherwise, they are required to turn off the auto-dialup
   function, and initial the PPPoE dial-up session from the host that
   supports PPPoE with IPv6.



Yang, et al.             Expires April 23, 2011                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft        Broadband Network Transition          October 2010


   The legacy subscribers are recommended to upgrade their OSs and CPEs,
   but not required.  They can still access by IPv4-only.  Third-party
   dial-up software could also be provided to support PPPoE with IPv6.

   The benefits and drawbacks for this solution could be:

   Pros:

   o  L2TP can be a temporary solution to provide Dual-stack services
      with fast and incremental deployment.  The BRASs that are unable
      to upgraded to Dual-stack can be replaced at the end of its
      lifecycle.

   o  When the IPv4 traffic disappears in the future, the network could
      be migrated to native IPv6 network gradually.

   o  There is no need to change the existing access method.  Although
      many existing routing mode CPEs are not supporting auto-dialup via
      PPPoE with IPv6, they can be replaced by existing subscribers
      smoothly or waiting for new technologies because the network still
      providing IPv4 service.  When the IPv6 contents are abundant
      enough, legacy subscribers would like to replace or upgrade their
      CPEs and OSs to gain more services.

   o  Although NAT44 technology is needed after the IPv4 address
      exhaustion, NAT[RFC3022] is relatively mature compared with IPv4/
      IPv6 Translation (e.g. stateful NAT64
      [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful], or stateless NAT64
      [I-D.xli-behave-ivi].  The major existing applications, such as
      Instant Messengers, E-mail Terminals and P2P downloaders are
      already supporting NAT traverse.  Transitioning with providing
      Dual-stack service is much smoother than providing IPv6-only
      service, especially at the initial stage of the IPv6 transition.

   o  There is no extra cost on the network operation and management.
      There is still only one physical network in each regional area and
      the operation and management team can use the original one, though
      some compulsory training is needed.

   Cons:

   o  The requirment is that there is at least one Dual-Stack BRAS in
      the network.  And if the BRASs that cannnot support Dual-stack is
      the majority, when the Dual-stack/IPv6 subscribers grows there
      could be many L2TP tunnels across the network and the traffic load
      among BRASs is not balanced which may impact the customer
      experience.  Incremental replacement of the old BRAS should be
      considered.

Internet-Draft        Broadband Network Transition          October 2010


   o  Although it is the same issue for any protocol translation
      technology, some existing applications which do not consider NAT44
      traverse may have some problems after the deployment of NAT44 LSN.
      For example, after the deployment of NAT44 LSN, the service of
      PPTP VPN has malfunction.  Parts of P2P users have worse
      experience.

   Applicable scenarios: This solution could be suitable for the initial
   stage or the intermediate stage of the IPv6 transition when the IPv4
   traffic is still very large in the network.  And the broadband
   network is going to provide Dual-stack services with incremental
   deployment.  It is also suitable when the number of subscribers is
   increasing very fast, and there is a large amount of CPEs and OSs
   that do not support PPPoE with IPv6.

6.2.  Dual-Stack over IPv6 - DS-lite

   In this solution, the CRs in the regional broadband network are Dual-
   stack or IPv6-only and the BRASs are IPv6-only.  This network is
   providing a Dual-stack service or an IPv6-only service for
   subscribers.  [See Figure 8]

           Figure 8: The DS-Lite Solution in IPv6 Infrastructure

   The Scenario for IPv6-only subscriber accessing a IPv6 BRAS is very
   simple.  But the routed CPE at the edge of customer premises network
   needs upgrade to support IPv6 and PPPoE with IPv6.  And the PC
   operation system (OS) also needs to support PPPoE with IPv6 with a

Internet-Draft        Broadband Network Transition          October 2010


   bridged CPE.  This scenario will exist when the IPv6 traffic is
   already dominant in the network.  The little IPv4 traffic will be
   translated by a NAT64 device located at the edge of IPv6 Ocean.  This
   situation is similar to the solution in Section 6.4

   The Scenario for Dual-stack subscriber is a little bit complicated.
   It provides Dual-stack service over an IPv6-only infrastructure.  The
   technologies like DS-Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] can be
   deployed in this scenario.  This section will focus on this
   technology.

   DS-Lite is a tunnel technology with a point-to-multipoint IPv4-in-
   IPv6 tunnel between B4 element and AFTR.  According to the definition
   in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], the B4 element is a function
   implemented on a dual-stack capable node, either a directly connected
   device or a CPE, which creates a tunnel to an DS-Lite Address Family
   Translation Router (AFTR) deployed somewhere in the regional
   broadband network.

   The operating system (OS) of the new subscriber is recommended to
   support PPPoE with IPv6.  Third-party dial-up software could be
   provided if the OS is not support PPPoE with IPv6.  Subscribers need
   to replace the existing CPEs for DS-Lite services.

   The pros and cons of the DS-Lite solution will be:

   Pros:

   o  We are assuming a completely IPv6 scenario, it is a one-step
      solution of IPv6 transition.  The network infrastructure does not
      need to upgrade to native IPv6 network in the future.

   o  AFTR is performing a NAT [RFC3022] behavior, which is relatively
      mature compared with IPv4/IPv6 Translation.  The major existing
      applications, such as Instant Messengers, E-mail Terminals and P2P
      downloaders are already supporting NAT traverse.  Transitioning
      with providing Dual-stack service is much smoother than providing
      IPv6-only service, especially at the initial stage of the IPv6
      transition.

   o  The IPv4 address used in DS-lite does not need to planned.  It is
      easy for operation and management.

   Cons:

   o  DS-Lite solution seems not suitable for the transition of the
      existing network that contains thousands of IPv4-only BRASs.
      Because the first step should be upgrade the existing BRAS to at



Yang, et al.             Expires April 23, 2011                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft        Broadband Network Transition          October 2010


      least Dual-stack. if the BRASs is upgraded to Dual-stack, DS-Lite
      does not need any more.  Moreover, if the CRs are Dual-stack, and
      it is planned to add new BRASs to provide Dual-stack service, the
      simplist solution is let the new BRASs to be Dual-stack.  So, DS-
      Lite solution is only suitable for the new build IPv6 network
      scenario.

   o  DS-lite CPEs are needed to provide to subscribers, and there is no
      mature product until now.  It may change the original access
      method and service provisioning method.  And the extra installment
      cost is unacceptable when the number of subscribers is huge.

   o  DS-Lite has not been deployed and verified in any large-scale
      commercial trail.  In the regional broadband network with a large
      number of dual-stack subscribers, a number of DS-Lite AFTR devices
      with high performance are needed.  The reengineering cost for this
      solution may be very high.

   Applicable scenarios: This solution is suitable for the scenarios
   that providing dual-stack services over an IPv6-only network
   infrastructure when IPv6 traffic is already dominant in the network.
   It is also suitable when the broadband subscribers are increasing
   slowly and the CPEs are provided by operators.  Some IPv6-only BRASs
   could be added for these new subscribers.  It is also suitable for
   the new services which may using IPv6-only, for example, IPTV and
   Machine-to-machine (M2M) services.

6.3.  Dual-Stack over IPv4 - 6rd

   In this solution, the CRs in the regional broadband network are IPv4-
   only or Dual-stack and the BRASs are IPv4-only.  It provides a Dual-
   stack service or an IPv6-only service with a completely/partly IPv4
   infrastructure for subscribers.

   The discussion will focus on scenario in Figure 9.

   Deployment (6rd) [RFC5969].  There are two components in this
   solution. 6rd CPEs support IPv6 on their customer premise side and
   support 6rd on the provider side. 6rd gateway (a.k.a 6rd border
   router or 6rd relay) is operated at the border between IPv4
   infrastructure and the IPv6 Internet.  The 6rd mechanism operates
   statelessly, which ensures simplicity and scalability.  The IPv4
   address in the IPv4 infrastructure could be a private address, 6rd
   mechanism can support the private IPv4 address.

   The pros and cons of the 6rd solution will be:

   Pros:

   o  6rd solution does not need to upgrade the IPv4 infrastructure.  It
      can deploy incrementally by adding some 6rd gateways in the
      network.  Therefore the engineering complexity and cost is low
      compared with other solutions.

   o  Although NAT44 technology is needed after the IPv4 address
      exhaustion, NAT[RFC3022] is relatively mature compared with IPv4/
      IPv6 Translation.  The major existing applications, such as
      Instant Messengers, E-mail Terminals and P2P downloaders are
      already supporting NAT traverse.  Transitioning with providing
      Dual-stack service is much smoother than providing IPv6-only
      service, especially at the initial stage of the IPv6 transition.

   o  There is no extra cost on the network operation and management.
      There is still only one physical network in each regional area and
      the operation and management team can use the original one, though
      some compulsory training is needed.

   Cons:

   o  When the network infrastructure is transitioning to IPv6 in the
      future, the access method may need to be changed again. 6rd is not
      applicable when the infrastructure is IPv6-only in the future.
      When the BRASs are removed by nature, the new BRASs for
      replacement will enable IPv6 and the 6rd may be useless.

   o  6rd CPE need to be provided to subscribers, which will lead to a
      huge amount of devices cost and installment cost.  And when the
      IPv6 traffic is extremely high, each regional broadband network
      may need a number of 6RD border routers to ensure the performance.

   Applicable scenarios: This solution may be suitable for the initial
   stage of the IPv6 transition, providing IPv6 services with rapid
   deployment.

6.4.  IPv6 and NAT64

   This solution is for the IPv6-only subscribers that are accessing to
   the new built IPv6-only regional broadband network.  Basically, only
   IPv6 address is allocated to the subscribers.  And for the
   requirement ofaccessing IPv4 applications and contents, it needs to
   deploy a IPv6/IPv4 Translation device to solve the intercommunication
   problem between IPv6 and IPv4 for the IPv6-only subscribers.

   The operating system (OS) is required to support PPPoE with IPv6.
   Third-party dial-up software could be provided if the OS of the new
   hosts is unable to support PPPoE with IPv6.

   The routing mode CPE that is purchased by subscribers is also
   required to support PPPoE with IPv6 as well, or to turn off the auto-
   dialup function, and initial the PPPoE with IPv6 dial-up session from
   the host.

   Pros:

   o  This solution is usually building a new IPv6 network which could
      avoid the risk from changing the existing regional broadband
      network.

   o  Building a completely new network is much easier than upgrade from
      the existing one.  That is because there is no subscriber with no
      traffic on the new network.

   o  It is no need to allocate IPv4 address for subscribers.

   o  It is benefit the development of IPv6 and push the IPv6 transition
      of ICPs.

   Cons:

   o  All the user terminals including CPEs have to support IPv6 which
      is unpractical at the initial stage of IPv6.

   o  NAT64 mechanisms have not been deployed and verified in large
      scale commercial trails.  And the NAT64 technologies are still
      immature, the users experience with this solution could be worse.

   o  The requirement of NAT64 device performance is very high,
      especially when there is a large amount of subscribers.  The
      situation could be much worse because the IPv4 traffic is still
      the majority at the IPv6 initial stage.

   o  The cost is huge and the investment is duplicated with the
      existing one.  The existing network infrastructure is usually kept
      up-to-date.  Building a new network may lead to an early end of
      the lifecycle of the existing network infrastructure, which will
      lead to investment loss.

   o  Building a completely new regional broadband network is usually
      along with building a new transmission infrastructure.  And the
      engineering period will be very long.

   o  After the new network is built, there are two networks in the same
      area, which will lead an extra operational cost.

   Applicable scenarios: This solution is suitable for the last-step of

   the IPv6 transition.  The IPv6 contents and services are already very
   popular and abundant.  Besides, IPv6/IPv4 Translation technology is
   relatively mature and the IPv4 traffic is little.  In this case, we
   can disable the IPv4 protocol stack of the Dual-stack devices, and
   NAT64 devices can also be deployed at several sites to meet the
   requirement of IPv6-only users who are visiting the historical IPv4
   services.

11.  Security Considerations

   The IETF is specifying security considerations for the solutions that
   it is providing for IPv6 migration.  However, it is possible that
   additional considerations arise due to the interoperation of these
   solutions, and the fact that the network is in a transitional state.
