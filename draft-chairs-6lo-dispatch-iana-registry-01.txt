           IANA Registry for 6lowpan ESC Dispatch Code points
               draft-chairs-6lo-dispatch-iana-registry-01

Abstract

   RFC4944 defines ESC dispatch type for additional dispatch bytes in
   the 6lowpan header.  The value of ESC byte has been updated by
   RFC6282.  However, the usage of ESC extension byte has not been
   defined in RFC6282 and RFC4944.  The purpose of this document is to
   define the ESC extension byte code points and to request
   corresponding IANA actions.

Internet-Draft              IANA-6lo-dispatch               October 2015


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4944] section 5.1 defines the dispatch header and types.  The ESC
   type is defined for using additional dispatch bytes in the 6lowpan
   header.  RFC 6282 modifies the value of the ESC dispatch type and it
   is recorded in IANA registry [6LOWPAN-IANA].  However, the bytes and
   usage following the ESC byte are not defined in either [RFC4944] and
   [RFC6282].  However, in recent years with 6lowpan deployments, the
   implementations and Standards organizations have started using the
   ESC extension bytes and a co-ordination between the respective
   organizations and IETF/IANA are needed.

   The following sections record the ITU-T specification for ESC
   dispatch byte code points as an existing known usage and propose the
   definition of ESC extension bytes for future applications.  The
   document also requests IANA actions for the first extension byte
   following the ESC byte.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Usage of ESC dispatch bytes

   RFC 4944 [RFC4944] first introduces this "ESC" dispatch header type
   for extension of dispatch bytes.  RFC 6282 [RFC6282] subsequently
   modified its value to [01 000000].

   This document specifies that the first octet following the ESC byte
   be used for extension type(extended dispatch values).  Subsequent
   octets are left unstructured for the specific use of the extension
   type:


   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |0 1| ESC       | ESC EXT Type  | Extended Dispatch Payload
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   ESC Extension Type(EET): It is the first byte following the ESC byte.
   Extension type defines the payload for the additional dispatch bytes.
   The values are from 0 to 255.  Value 0 and 255 are reserved for
   future use.  These values are assigned by IANA.  The EET values are
   similar to dispatch values in the 6lowpan header except they are
   preceeded by the ESC byte.  Thus, ESC extension types and dispatch
   values are using orthogonal code spaces.  Though not desirable,
   multiple ESC bytes MAY appear in a 6lowpan header.  Section 3.1
   describes how to handle unknown ESC dispatch type.

   Extended Dispatch Payload(EDP): This part of frame format must be
   defined by the corresponding extension type.  A specification is
   required to define each usage of extension type and its corresponding
   Extension Payload.

   Note that section 5.1 in RFC4944 indicates that the Extension Type
   field may contain additional dispatch values larger than 63
   [4944-ERRATA].  Note that the new dispatch type MUST NOT modify the
   behavior of existing dispatch types for the sake of interoperability.

3.1.  Interaction with other RFC4944 implementations

   It is expected that RFC4944 existing implementations are not capable
   of processing ESC extension data bytes as defined in this document.
   However, implementors have to assume that existing implementation
   that attempt to process an EET unknown to them will simply drop the
   packet or ignore the ESC dispatch bytes.

   If an implementation following this document, during processing of
   the received packet reaches the ESC byte for which it does not
   understand the extension bytes (EET), it MUST drop that packet.
   However, it is important to clarify that a router node SHOULD forward
   a 6lowpan packet with the EET bytes as long as it does not attempt to
   process any ESC extension bytes.

   Sequence Of dispatch bytes and ESC bytes: Multiple ESC extension
   bytes may appear in a packet.  Could a 6lowpan packet start with a
   ESC dispatch type?  In another word, should ESC extension always be
   preceeded by non-ESC dispatch bytes?

   gab: I think the answer is no.  But per the previous sentence, you
   have to assume that your packet will get dropped immediately by any
   node that does not understand the EET at the beginning of the packet.
   The closer to the end of the packet are the EET's, the higher chance
   there is that a legacy node will recognize and successfully process
   some dispatch type before the EET and then ignore the EET instead of
   dropping the entire packet.  Unless you know for sure that all nodes
   in your network understand a given EET (by definition a private and

   non-standard deployment), placing it at the beginning is a good way
   to guarantee that the packet will get dropped.

3.2.  ESC Extension Bytes Typical Sequence

   The following diagram provides an example when ESC extension bytes
   might be used:



   A LoWPAN encapsulated HC1 compressed packet:
   +----------+-----------------+---------+-----+-----+--------+
   | Dispatch | LOWPAN_IPHC hdr | Payld   |ESC  | EET |EPayld  |
   +----------------------------+---------+-----+-----+--------+

   A LoWPAN_IPHC Header, Mesh header and an ESC extenstion byte:

   +-------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-----+-----+-------+
   | M Typ | M Hdr | LOWPAN_IPHC Hdr | Payld |ESC  | EET | EPayld|
   +-------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-----+-----+-------+

3.3.  Example: ITU-T G.9903  ESC type usage

   [G3-PLC] provides native mesh-under functionalities.  The ESC
   dispatch type is used with the command frames specified in figure
   9-12 and Table 9-35 in [G3-PLC] .  The command ID values are 0x01 to
   0x1F.

   The frame format is defined as follows:


   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

3.4.  NALP Usage

   There were several comments on 00 draft -- that this draft should
   provide guidance on NALP usage as there was no clear distinction
   between ITU-T command mode usage and NALP usage.  In order to avaoid
   such confusion, a NALP usage guidance should be provided.  This is a
   space holder section in order to decide whether NALP usage indeed
   should belong here.

   gab: I don't think we need to say anything beyond what we already say
   in 4944: it is not a 6lowpan frame.  This was done recognizing that
   some SDO's would also define their own frame structure, in
   particular, Zigbee.  There was some effort to agree with them on some
   way for our definitions to not collide.  So prescribing usage of
   NALP, beyond saying it is not 6lowpan nor the subject of any IETF
   document, would defeat the purpose.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the 'ESC Extension Type'
   values as per the policy 'Specification Required'[RFC5226] as
   specified in this document which follows the same policy as in the
   IANA section of [RFC4944].  For each Extension Type(except the
   Reserved values)the specification MUST define corresponding Extended
   Dispatch Payload frame bytes for the receiver implementation to read
   the ESC bytes with interoperability.

   The initial values for the 'ESC Extension Type' fields are:


   +-------+---------------------------------+---------------+
   | Value | Description                     | Reference     |
   +-------+---------------------------------+---------------+
   |  0    | Reserved for future use         | This document |
   |       |                                 |               |
   | 1-31  | Used by ITU-T G.9903 and G.9905 | ITU-T G.9903 &|
   |       |     Command IDs                 | ITU-T G.9905  |
   |       |                                 |               |
   | 32-254| Unassigned                      | This document |
   |       |(Reserved for future IANA        |               |
   |       | Assignment-- Spec Required)     |               |
   |       |                                 |               |
   | 255   | Reserved for future use         | This document |
   +-------+---------------------------------+---------------+

5.  Security Considerations

   There is no additional security threats due to the assignments of ESC
   byte usage described in this document.  However, this document
   forbids defining any extended dispatch values or extension types that
   modifies the behavior of existing Dispatch types.
