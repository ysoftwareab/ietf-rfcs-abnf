1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC, which is broadly defined in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and
   [RFC4035], uses cryptographic keys and digital signatures to provide
   authentication of DNS data.  Currently, the most popular signature
   algorithm in use is RSA.  GOST ([RFC5933]) and NIST-specified
   elliptic curve cryptography ([RFC6605]) are also standardized.

   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] describes the elliptic curve signature system
   EdDSA and recommends two curves, Ed25519 and Ed448.

   This document defines the use of DNSSEC's DS, DNSKEY, and RRSIG
   resource records (RRs) with a new signing algorithm, Edwards-curve
   Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) using a choice of two curves,
   Ed25519 and Ed448.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  DNSKEY Resource Records

   An Ed25519 public key consists of a 32-octet value, which is encoded
   into the Public Key field of a DNSKEY resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The generation of a public key is defined in Chapter 5.1.5
   in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].

Internet-Draft              EdDSA for DNSSEC                  April 2016


   An Ed448 public key consists of a 57-octet value, which is encoded
   into the Public Key field of a DNSKEY resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The generation of a public key is defined in Chapter 5.2.5
   in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].

4.  RRSIG Resource Records

   In Chapter 10.3 in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa], the use of a context label
   is described.  EdDSA signatures in this scheme use the 17-octet
   context label 'DNSSEC SIGNATURE\0' (where \0 represents a zero-valued
   octet).

   (Note: Only Ed448 has the Context specified.  Before publishing the
   final draft we need to specify what to do with Ed25519 Context.)

   An Ed25519 signature consists of a 64-octet value, which is encoded
   into the Signature field of an RRSIG resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The Ed25519 signature algorithm is described in Chapter
   5.1.6 in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].

   An Ed448 signature consists of a 114-octet value, which is encoded
   into the Signature field of an RRSIG resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The Ed448 signature algorithm is described in Chapter 5.2.6
   and verification of the Ed448 signature is described in Chapter 5.2.7
   in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].

5.  Algorithm Number for DS, DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records

   The algorithm number associated with the use of Ed25519 in DS, DNSKEY
   and RRSIG resource records is TBD.  The algorithm number associated
   with the use of Ed448 in DS, DNSKEY and RRSIG resource records is
   TBD.  This registration is fully defined in the IANA Considerations
   section.

9.  Implementation Status

   (Note to the RFC Editor: please remove this entire section as well as
   the reference to RFC 6982 before publication.)

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC6982], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

10.  Security Considerations

   The security level of Ed25519 is slightly under the standard 128-bit
   level and the security level of Ed448 is slightly under the standard
   224-bit level ([RFC7748]).  Security considerations listed in
   [RFC7748] also apply to the usage of Ed25519 and Ed448 in DNSSEC.
   Such an assessment could, of course, change in the future if new
   attacks that work better than the ones known today are found.
