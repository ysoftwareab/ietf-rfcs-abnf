1.  Introduction

   The distributed mobility management (DMM) WG has studied the problems
   of centralized deployment of mobility management protocols and
   specified the DMM requirements [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].  This
   document investigates whether it is feasible to deploy current IP
   mobility protocols in a DMM scenario in a way that can fulfill the
   requirements.  It discusses current deployment practices of existing
   mobility protocols and identifies the limitations (gaps) in these
   practices from the standpoint of satisfying DMM requirements, as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

   The rest of this document is organized as follows.  Section 3
   analyzes existing IP mobility protocols by examining their functions
   and how these functions can be configured and used to work in a DMM
   environment.  Section 4 presents the current practices of IP wireless
   networks and 3GPP architectures.  Both network- and host-based
   mobility protocols are considered.  Section 5 presents the gap
   analysis with respect to the current practices.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   All general mobility-related terms and their acronyms used in this
   document are to be interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6 base
   specification [RFC6275] and in the Proxy mobile IPv6 specification
   [RFC5213].  These terms include mobile node (MN), correspondent node
   (CN), home agent (HA), local mobility anchor (LMA), and mobile access
   gateway (MAG).

   In addition, this document also introduces some definitions of IP
   mobility functions in Section 3.

   In this document there are also references to a "distributed mobility
   management environment".  By this term, we refer to a scenario in
   which the IP mobility, access network and routing solutions allow for
   setting up IP networks so that traffic is distributed in an optimal
   way, without the reliance on centrally deployed anchors to manage IP
   mobility sessions.


3.  Functions of existing mobility protocols

   The host-based Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] and its network-based extension,



Liu, et al.              Expires January 4, 2015                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       DMM-best-practices-gap-analysis           July 2014


   PMIPv6 [RFC5213], even HMIPv6 [RFC5380] are logically centralized
   mobility management approaches addressing primarily hierarchical
   mobile networks.  Although these two are centralized approaches, they
   have important mobility management functions resulting from years of
   extensive work to develop and to extend these functions.  It is
   therefore useful to take these existing functions and examine them in
   a DMM scenario in order to understand how to deploy the existing
   mobility protocols to provide distributed mobility management.

   The main mobility management functions of MIPv6, PMIPv6, and HMIPv6
   are the following:

   1.  Anchoring function (AF): allocation to a mobile node of an IP
       address (a Home Address (HoA)) or prefix (a Home Network Prefix
       (HNP)) topologically anchored by the advertising node (i.e., the
       anchor node is able to advertise a connected route into the
       routing infrastructure for the allocated IP prefixes).  It is a
       control plane function.


   2.  Internetwork Location Information (LI) function: managing and
       keeping track of the internetwork location of an MN.  The
       location information may be a binding of the IP advertised
       address/prefix (e.g., HoA or HNP) to the IP routing address of
       the MN or of a node that can forward packets destined to the MN.
       It is a control plane function.

       In a client-server protocol model, location query and update
       messages may be exchanged between a location information client
       (LIc) and a location information server (LIs).


   3.  Forwarding Management (FM) function: packet interception and
       forwarding to/from the IP address/prefix assigned to the MN,
       based on the internetwork location information, either to the
       destination or to some other network element that knows how to
       forward the packets to their destination.

       FM may optionally be split into the control plane (FM-CP) and
       data plane (FM-DP).


   In Mobile IPv6, the home agent (HA) typically provides the anchoring
   function (AF); the location information server (LIs) is at the HA
   while the location information client (LIc) is at the MN; the
   forwarding management (FM) function is both ends of tunneling at the
   HA and the MN.

Internet-Draft       DMM-best-practices-gap-analysis           July 2014


   In Proxy Mobile IPv6, the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) provides the
   anchoring function (AF); the location information server (LIs) is at
   the LMA while the location information client (LIc) is at the mobile
   access gateway (MAG); the forwarding management (FM) function is both
   ends of tunneling at the HA and the MAG.

   In Hierarchical mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) [RFC5380], the mobility anchor
   point (MAP) serves as a location information aggregator between the
   LIs at the HA and the LIc at the MN.  The MAP also has FM function to
   enable tunneling between HA and itself as well as tunneling between
   MN and itself.


4.  DMM practices

   This section documents deployment practices of existing mobility
   protocols to satisfy distributed mobility management requirement.
   This description considers both IP wireless (e.g., evolved Wi-Fi
   hotspots) and 3GPP Architecture flattening approaches(i.e. fewer
   levels of routing hierarchy introduced into the data path by the
   mobility management system).

   While describing the current DMM practices, references to the generic
   mobility management functions described in Section 3 are provided, as
   well as some initial hints on the identified gaps with respect to the
   DMM requirements documented in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

4.1.  Assumptions

   There are many different approaches that can be considered to
   implement and deploy a distributed anchoring and mobility solution.
   The focus of the gap analysis is on certain current mobile network
   architectures and standardized IP mobility solutions, considering any
   kind of deployment options which do not violate the original protocol
   specifications.  In order to limit the scope of our analysis of DMM
   practices, we consider the following list of technical assumptions:

   1.  Both host- and network-based solutions should be considered.

   2.  Solutions should allow selecting and using the most appropriate
       IP anchor among a set of available candidates.

   3.  Mobility management should be realized by the preservation of the
       IP address across the different points of attachment (i.e.,
       provision of IP address continuity).  This is in contrast to
       certain transport-layer based approaches such as SCTP or
       application-layer mobility.

   Applications which can cope with changes in the MN's IP address do
   not depend on IP mobility management protocols such as DMM.
   Typically, a connection manager together with the operating system
   will configure the source address selection mechanism of the IP
   stack.  This might involve identifying application capabilities and
   triggering the mobility support accordingly.  Further considerations
   on application management and source address selection are out of the
   scope of this document, but the reader might consult [RFC-
   SourceAddrSelection].

4.2.  IP flat wireless network

   This section focuses on common IP wireless network architectures and
   how they can be flattened from an IP mobility and anchoring point of
   view using common and standardized protocols.  We take Wi-Fi as an
   useful wireless technology, since it is widely known and deployed
   nowadays.  Some representative examples of Wi-Fi deployment
   architectures are depicted in Figure 1.

   In the figure, three typical deployment options are shown
   [I-D.gundavelli-v6ops-community-wifi-svcs].  On the left hand side of
   the figure, mobile nodes directly connect to a Residential Gateway
   (RG) which is a network device at the customer premises and provides

   both wireless layer-2 access connectivity (i.e., it hosts the 802.11
   Access Point function) and layer-3 routing functions.  In the middle
   of the figure, mobile nodes connect to Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) that
   are managed by a WLAN Controller (WLC), which performs radio resource
   management on the APs, domain-wide mobility policy enforcement and
   centralized forwarding function for the user traffic.  The WLC could
   also implement layer-3 routing functions, or attach to an access
   router (AR).  Last, on the right-hand side of the figure, access
   points are directly connected to an access router.  This can also be
   used as a generic connectivity model.

   IP mobility protocols can be used to provide inter-access mobility
   support to users, e.g. handover from Wi-Fi to cellular access.  Two
   kind of protocols can be used: Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] or Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC5555], with the mobility anchor (e.g., local mobility anchor
   or home agent) role typically being played by the edge router of the
   mobile network [SDO-3GPP.23.402].

   Although this section has made use of the example of Wi-Fi networks,
   there are other IP flat wireless network architectures specified,
   such as WiMAX [IEEE.802-16.2009], which integrates both host and
   network-based IP mobility functionality.

   Existing IP mobility protocols can also be deployed in a more
   flattened manner, so that the anchoring and access aggregation
   functions are distributed.  We next describe several practices for
   the deployment of existing mobility protocols in a distributed
   mobility management environment.  The analysis in this section is
   limited to protocol solutions based on existing IP mobility
   protocols, either host- or network-based, such as Mobile IPv6
   [RFC6275], [RFC5555], Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213], [RFC5844] and NEMO
   [RFC3963].  Extensions to these base protocol solutions are also
   considered.  The analysis is divided into two parts: host- and
   network-based practices.

4.2.1.  Host-based IP DMM practices

   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC6275] and its extension to support mobile
   networks, the NEMO Basic Support protocol (hereafter, simply referred
   to as NEMO) [RFC3963] are well-known host-based IP mobility
   protocols.  They depend upon the function of the Home Agent (HA), a
   centralized anchor, to provide mobile nodes (hosts and routers) with
   mobility support.  In these approaches, the home agent typically
   provides the anchoring function (AF), forwarding management (FM), and
   Internetwork Location Information server (LIs) functions.  The mobile
   node possesses the Location Information client (LIc) function and the
   FM function to enable tunneling between HA and itself.  We next
   describe some practices that show how MIPv6/NEMO and several other



Liu, et al.              Expires January 4, 2015                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       DMM-best-practices-gap-analysis           July 2014


   protocol extensions can be deployed in a distributed mobility
   management environment.

   One approach to distribute the anchors can be to deploy several HAs
   (as shown in Figure 2), and assign the topologically closest anchor
   to each MN [RFC4640], [RFC5026], [RFC6611].  In the example shown in
   Figure 2, MN1 is assigned HA1 (and a home address anchored by HA1),
   while MN2 is assigned HA2.  Note that MIPv6/NEMO specifications do
   not prevent the simultaneous use of multiple home agents by a single
   mobile node.  In this deployment model, the mobile node can use
   several anchors at the same time, each of them anchoring IP flows
   initiated at a different point of attachment.  However there is no
   mechanism specified by IETF to enable an efficient dynamic discovery
   of available anchors and the selection of the most suitable one.
   Note that some of these mechanisms [SDO-3GPP.23.402] have been
   defined outside IETF.

     Figure 2: Distributed operation of Mobile IPv6 (BT and RO) / NEMO

   Since one of the goals of the deployment of mobility protocols in a
   distributed mobility management environment is to avoid the
   suboptimal routing caused by centralized anchoring, the Route
   Optimization (RO) support provided by Mobile IPv6 can also be used to
   achieve a flatter IP data forwarding.  By default, Mobile IPv6 and

   NEMO use the so-called Bidirectional Tunnel (BT) mode, in which data
   traffic is always encapsulated between the MN and its HA before being
   directed to any other destination.  The Route Optimization (RO) mode
   allows the MN to update its current location on the CNs, and then use
   the direct path between them.  Using the example shown in Figure 2,
   MN1 is using BT mode with CN1 and MN2 is in RO mode with CN2.
   However, the RO mode has several drawbacks:

   o  The RO mode is only supported by Mobile IPv6.  There is no route
      optimization support standardized for the NEMO protocol because of
      the security problems posed by extending return routability tests
      for prefixes, although many different solutions have been proposed
      [RFC4889].

   o  The RO mode requires signaling that adds some protocol overhead.

   o  The signaling required to enable RO involves the home agent and is
      repeated periodically for security reasons [RFC4225] and, thus,
      the HA remains a single point of failure.

   o  The RO mode requires support from the correspondent node (CN).

   Notwithstanding these considerations, the RO mode does offer the
   possibility of substantially reducing traffic through the Home Agent,
   in cases when it can be supported by the relevant correspondent
   nodes.  Note that a mobile node can also use its CoA directly
   [RFC5014] when communicating with CNs on the same link or anywhere in
   the Internet, although no session continuity support would be
   provided by the IP stack in this case.

   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) [RFC5380] (as shown in Figure 3),
   is another host-based IP mobility extension which can be considered
   as a complement to provide a less centralized mobility deployment.
   It allows reducing the amount of mobility signaling as well as
   improving the overall handover performance of Mobile IPv6 by
   introducing a new hierarchy level to handle local mobility.  The
   Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) entity is introduced as a local mobility
   handling node deployed closer to the mobile node.  It provides LI
   intermediary function between the LI server (LIs) at the HA and the
   LI client (LIc) at the MN.  It also performs the FM function using
   tunneling with the HA and also to tunnel with the MN.

                    Figure 3: Hierarchical Mobile IPv6

   When HMIPv6 is used, the MN has two different temporary addresses:
   the Regional Care-of Address (RCoA) and the Local Care-of Address
   (LCoA).  The RCoA is anchored at one MAP, that plays the role of
   local home agent, while the LCoA is anchored at the access router
   level.  The mobile node uses the RCoA as the CoA signaled to its home
   agent.  Therefore, while roaming within a local domain handled by the
   same MAP, the mobile node does not need to update its home agent
   (i.e., the mobile node does not change its RCoA).

   The use of HMIPv6 enables some form of route optimization, since a
   mobile node may decide to directly use the RCoA as source address for
   a communication with a given correspondent node, particularly if the
   MN does not expect to move outside the local domain during the
   lifetime of the communication.  This can be seen as a potential DMM
   mode of operation,though it fails to provide session continuity if
   and when the MN moves outside the local domain.  In the example shown



Liu, et al.              Expires January 4, 2015               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       DMM-best-practices-gap-analysis           July 2014


   in Figure 3, MN1 is using its global HoA to communicate with CN1,
   while it is using its RCoA to communicate with CN2.

   Furthermore, a local domain might have several MAPs deployed,
   enabling therefore a different kind of HMIPv6 deployments (e.g., flat
   and distributed).  The HMIPv6 specification supports a flexible
   selection of the MAP (e.g., based on the distance between the MN and
   the MAP, taking into consideration the expected mobility pattern of
   the MN, etc.).

   Another extension that can be used to help distributing mobility
   management functions is the Home Agent switch specification
   [RFC5142], which defines a new mobility header for signaling a mobile
   node that it should acquire a new home agent.  [RFC5142] does not
   specify the case of changing the mobile node's home address, as that
   might imply loss of connectivity for ongoing persistent connections.
   Nevertheless, that specification could be used to force the change of
   home agent in those situations where there are no active persistent
   data sessions that cannot cope with a change of home address.

   There are other host-based approaches standardized within IETF that
   can be used to provide mobility support.  For example MOBIKE
   [RFC4555] allows a mobile node encrypting traffic through IKEv2
   [RFC5996] to change its point of attachment while maintaining a
   Virtual Private Network (VPN) session.  The MOBIKE protocol allows
   updating the VPN Security Associations (SAs) in cases where the base
   connection initially used is lost and needs to be re-established.
   The use of the MOBIKE protocol avoids having to perform an IKEv2 re-
   negotiation.  Similar considerations to those made for Mobile IPv6
   can be applied to MOBIKE; though MOBIKE is best suited for situations
   where the address of at least one endpoint is relatively stable and
   can be discovered using existing mechanisms such as DNS.

   IETF has defined extensions to the mobility protocol to optimize the
   handover performance.  Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers (FMIPv6) [RFC5568]
   is the extension to optimize handover latency.  It defines new access
   router discovery mechanism before handover to reduce the new network
   discovery latency.  It also defines a tunnel between the previous
   access router and the new access router to reduce the packet loss
   during handover.  IETF seamoby working group also has published
   Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) [RFC4066] and Context
   Transfer Protocol (CXTP) [RFC4067] to improve the handover
   performance.  The DMM deployment practice discussed in this section
   can also use those extensions to improve the handover performance.

4.2.2.  Network-based IP DMM practices

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] is the main network-based IP
   mobility protocol specified for IPv6.  Proxy Mobile IPv4 [RFC5844]
   defines some IPv4 extensions.  With network-based IP mobility
   protocols, the local mobility anchor (LMA) typically provides the
   anchoring function (AF), Forwarding management (FM) function, and
   Internetwork Location Information server (LIs) function.  The mobile
   access gateway (MAG) provides the Location Information client (LIc)
   function and Forwarding management (FM) function to tunnel with LMA.
   PMIPv6 is architecturally almost identical to MIPv6, as the mobility
   signaling and routing between LMA and MAG in PMIPv6 is similar to
   those between HA and MN in MIPv6.  The required mobility
   functionality at the MN is provided by the MAG so that the
   involvement in mobility support by the MN is not required.

   We next describe some practices that show how network-based mobility
   protocols and several other protocol extensions can be deployed in a
   distributed mobility management environment.

   One way to decentralize Proxy Mobile IPv6 operation can be to deploy
   several local mobility anchors and use some selection criteria to
   assign LMAs to attaching mobile nodes (an example of this type of
   assignment is shown in Figure 4).  As with the client based approach,
   a mobile node may use several anchors at the same time, each of them
   anchoring IP flows initiated at a different point of attachment.
   This assignment can be static or dynamic.  The main advantage of this
   simple approach is that the IP address anchor (i.e., the LMA) could
   be placed closer to the mobile node.  Therefore the resulting paths
   are close-to-optimal.  On the other hand, as soon as the mobile node
   moves, the resulting path will start deviating from the optimal one.

           Figure 4: Distributed operation of Proxy Mobile IPv6

   Similar to the host-based IP mobility case, network-based IP mobility
   has some extensions defined to mitigate the suboptimal routing issues
   that may arise due to the use of a centralized anchor.  The Local
   Routing extensions [RFC6705] enable optimal routing in Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 in three cases: i) when two communicating MNs are attached to
   the same MAG and LMA, ii) when two communicating MNs are attached to
   different MAGs but to the same LMA, and iii) when two communicating
   MNs are attached to the same MAG but have different LMAs.  In these
   three cases, data traffic between the two mobile nodes does not
   traverse the LMA(s), thus providing some form of path optimization
   since the traffic is locally routed at the edge.  The main
   disadvantage of this approach is that it only tackles the MN-to-MN
   communication scenario, and only under certain circumstances.

   An interesting extension that can also be used to facilitate the
   deployment of network-based mobility protocols in a distributed
   mobility management environment is the LMA runtime assignment
   [RFC6463].  This extension specifies a runtime local mobility anchor
   assignment functionality and corresponding mobility options for Proxy
   Mobile IPv6.  This runtime local mobility anchor assignment takes
   place during the Proxy Binding Update / Proxy Binding Acknowledgment
   message exchange between a mobile access gateway and a local mobility
   anchor.  While this mechanism is mainly aimed for load-balancing
   purposes, it can also be used to select an optimal LMA from the

Internet-Draft       DMM-best-practices-gap-analysis           July 2014


   routing point of view.  A runtime LMA assignment can be used to
   change the assigned LMA of an MN, for example, in cases when the
   mobile node does not have any active session, or when the running
   sessions can survive an IP address change.  Note that several
   possible dynamic local mobility anchor discovery solutions can be
   used, as described in [RFC6097].

4.3.  3GPP network flattening approaches

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is the standards
   development organization that specifies the 3rd generation mobile
   network and the Evolved Packet System (EPS), which mainly comprises
   the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and a new radio access network, usually
   referred to as LTE (Long Term Evolution).

   Architecturally, the 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network is
   similar to an IP wireless network running PMIPv6 or MIPv6, as it
   relies on the Packet Data Gateway (PGW) anchoring services to provide
   mobile nodes with mobility support (see Figure 5).  There are client-
   based and network-based mobility solutions in 3GPP, which for
   simplicity will be analyzed together.  We next describe how 3GPP
   mobility protocols and several other completed or ongoing extensions
   can be deployed to meet some of the DMM requirements
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

   The GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) [SDO-3GPP.29.060] [SDO-3GPP.29.281]
   [SDO-3GPP.29.274] is a network-based mobility protocol specified for
   3GPP networks (S2a, S2b, S5 and S8 interfaces).  Similar to PMIPv6,
   it can handle mobility without requiring the involvement of the
   mobile nodes.  In this case, the mobile node functionality is
   provided in a proxy manner by the Serving Data Gateway (SGW), Evolved
   Packet Data Gateway (ePDG), or Trusted Wireless Access Gateway (TWAG

   LIPA, on the other hand, enables an IP addressable UE connected via a
   Home eNB (HeNB) to access other IP addressable entities in the same
   residential/enterprise IP network without traversing the mobile
   operator's network core in the user plane.  In order to achieve this,
   a Local GW (L-GW) collocated with the HeNB is used.  LIPA is
   established by the UE requesting a new PDN (Public Data Network)
   connection to an access point name for which LIPA is permitted, and

   The 3GPP architecture specifications also provide mechanisms to allow
   discovery and selection of gateways [SDO-3GPP.29.303].  These
   mechanisms enable decisions taking into consideration topological
   location and gateway collocation aspects, relying upon the DNS as a
   "location database".

   Both SIPTO and LIPA have a very limited mobility support, specially
   in 3GPP specifications up to Rel-12.  Briefly, LIPA mobility support
   is limited to handovers between HeNBs that are managed by the same
   L-GW (i.e., mobility within the local domain).  There is no guarantee
   of IP session continuity for SIPTO.


5.  Gap analysis

   The goal of this section is to identify the limitations in the
   current practices, described in Section 4, with respect to the DMM
   requirements listed in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

5.1.  Distributed mobility management - REQ1

   According to requirement #1 stated in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements], IP
   mobility, network access and forwarding solutions provided by DMM
   must enable traffic to avoid traversing single mobility anchor far
   from the optimal route.

   From the analysis performed in Section 4, a DMM deployment can meet
   the requirement "REQ#1 Distributed mobility management" usually
   relying on the following functions:





Liu, et al.              Expires January 4, 2015               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft       DMM-best-practices-gap-analysis           July 2014


   o  Multiple (distributed) anchoring: ability to anchor different
      sessions of a single mobile node at different anchors.  In order
      to provide improved routing, some anchors might need to be placed
      closer to the mobile node or the corresponding node.

   o  Dynamic anchor assignment/re-location: ability to i) assign the
      initial anchor, and ii) dynamically change the initially assigned
      anchor and/or assign a new one (this may also require to transfer
      mobility context between anchors).  This can be achieved either by
      changing anchor for all ongoing sessions or by assigning new
      anchors just for new sessions.

   Both the main client- and network-based IP mobility protocols, namely
   (DS)MIPv6 and PMIPv6 allow deploying multiple anchors (i.e., home
   agents and localized mobility anchors), therefore providing the
   multiple anchoring function.  However, existing solutions only
   provide a initial anchor assignment, thus the lack of dynamic anchor
   change/new anchor assignment is a gap.  Neither the HA switch nor the
   LMA runtime assignment allow changing the anchor during an ongoing
   session.  This actually comprises several gaps: ability to perform
   anchor assignment at any time (not only at the initial MN's
   attachment), ability of the current anchor to initiate/trigger the
   relocation, and ability to transfer registration context between
   anchors.

   Dynamic anchor assignment may lead the MN to manage different
   mobility sessions served by different mobility anchors.  This is not
   an issue with client based mobility management where the mobility
   client natively knows each anchor associated to each mobility
   sessions.  However, there is one gap, as the MN should be capable of
   handling IP addresses in a DMM-friendly way, meaning that the MN can
   perform smart source address selection (i.e., deprecating IP
   addresses from previous mobility anchors, so they are not used for
   new sessions).  Besides, managing different mobility sessions served
   by different mobility anchors may raise issues with network based
   mobility management.  In this case, the mobile client, located in the
   network (e.g., MAG), usually retrieves the MN's anchor from the MN's
   policy profile (e.g., Section 6.2 of [RFC5213]).  Currently, the MN's
   policy profile implicitly assumes a single serving anchor and, thus,
   does not maintain the association between home network prefix and
   anchor.

   The consequence of the distribution of the mobility anchors is that
   there might be more than one available anchor for a mobile node to
   use, which leads to an anchor discovery and selection issue.
   Currently, there is no efficient mechanism specified by IETF to allow
   dynamically discovering the presence of nodes that can play the
   anchor role, discovering their capabilities and selecting the most



Liu, et al.              Expires January 4, 2015               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft       DMM-best-practices-gap-analysis           July 2014


   suitable one.  There is also no mechanism to allow selecting a node
   that is currently anchoring a given home address/prefix (capability
   sometimes required to meet REQ#2).  There are though some mechanisms
   that could help discovering anchors, such as the Dynamic Home Agent
   Address Discovery (DHAAD), the use of the Home Agent (H) flag in
   Router Advertisements (which indicates that the router sending the
   Router Advertisement is also functioning as a Mobile IPv6 home agent
   on the link) or the MAP option in Router Advertisements defined by
   HMIPv6.  Note that there are 3GPP mechanisms providing that
   functionality defined in [SDO-3GPP.29.303].

   Regarding the ability to transfer registration context between
   anchors, there are already some solutions that could be reused or
   adapted to fill that gap, such as Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6
   [RFC5568] -- to enable traffic redirection from the old to the new
   anchor --, the Context Transfer protocol [RFC4067] -- to enable the
   required transfer of registration information between anchors --, or
   the Handover Keying architecture solutions [RFC6697], to speed up the
   re-authentication process after a change of anchor.  Note that some
   extensions might be needed in the context of DMM, as these protocols
   were designed in the context of centralized client IP mobility,
   focusing on the access re-attachment and authentication.

   Also note that REQ1 is such that the data plane traffic can avoid
   suboptimal route.  Distributed processing of the traffic is then
   needed only in the data plane.  The needed capability in distributed
   processing therefore should not contradict with centralized control
   plane.  Other control plane solutions such as charging, lawful
   interception, etc. should not be limited.  Yet combining the control
   plane and data plane forwarding management (FM) function may limit
   the choice to distributing both data plane and control plane
   together.  In order to enable distributing only the data plane
   without distributing the control plane, a gap is to split the
   forwarding management function into the control plane (FM-CP) and
   data plane (FM-DP).

5.2.  Bypassable network-layer mobility support  for each application
      session - REQ2

   The need for "bypassable network-layer mobility support for each
   application session" introduced in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements]
   requires flexibility on determining whether network-layer mobility
   support is needed.  The requirement enables one to choose whether or
   not use network-layer mobility support.  It only enables the two
   following functions:

   o  Dynamically assign/relocate anchor: a mobility anchor is assigned
      only to sessions which uses the network-layer mobility support.



Liu, et al.              Expires January 4, 2015               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft       DMM-best-practices-gap-analysis           July 2014


      The MN may thus manage more than one session; some of them may be
      associated with anchored IP address(es), while the others may be
      associated with local IP address(es).

   o  Multiple IP address management: this function is related to the
      preceding and is about the ability of the mobile node to
      simultaneously use multiple IP addresses and select the best one
      (from an anchoring point of view) to use on a per-session/
      application/service basis.  This requires MN to acquire
      information regarding the properties of the available IP
      addresses.

   The dynamic anchor assignment/relocation needs to ensure that IP
   address continuity is guaranteed for sessions that uses such mobility
   support (e.g., in some scenarios, the provision of mobility locally
   within a limited area might be enough from the mobile node or the
   application point of view) at the relocated anchor.  Implicitly, when
   no applications are using the network-layer mobility support, DMM may
   release the needed resources.  This may imply having the knowledge of
   which sessions at the mobile node are active and are using the
   mobility support.  This is something typically known only by the MN
   (e.g., by its connection manager).  Therefore, (part of) this
   knowledge might need to be transferred to/shared with the network.

   Multiple IP address management provides the MN with the choice to
   pick-up the correct address (provided with mobility support or not)
   depending on the application requirements.  When using client based
   mobility management, the mobile node is itself aware of the anchoring
   capabilities of its assigned IP addresses.  This is not necessarily
   the case with network based IP mobility management; current
   mechanisms do not allow the MN to be aware of the properties of its
   IP addresses (e.g., the MN does not know whether the allocated IP
   addresses are anchored).  However, there are proposals that the
   network could indicate such IP address properties during assignment
   procedures, such as [I-D.bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix],
   [I-D.korhonen-6man-prefix-properties] and [I-D.anipko-mif-mpvd-arch].
   Although there exist these individual efforts that could be be
   considered as attempts to fix the gap, there is no solution adopted
   as a work item within any IETF working group.

   The handling of mobility management to the granularity of an
   individual session of a user/device SHOULD need proper session
   identification in addition to user/device identification.

5.3.  IPv6 deployment - REQ3

   This requirement states that DMM solutions should primarily target
   IPv6 as the primary deployment environment.  IPv4 support is not



Liu, et al.              Expires January 4, 2015               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft       DMM-best-practices-gap-analysis           July 2014


   considered mandatory and solutions should not be tailored
   specifically to support IPv4.

   All analyzed DMM practices support IPv6.  Some of them, such as
   MIPv6/NEMO (including the support of dynamic HA selection), MOBIKE,
   SIPTO have also IPv4 support.  There are also some solutions that
   have some limited IPv4 support (e.g., PMIPv6).  In conclusion, this
   requirement is met by existing DMM practices.

5.4.  Existing mobility protocols - REQ4

   A DMM solution must first consider reusing and extending IETF-
   standardized protocols before specifying new protocols.

   As stated in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements], a DMM solution could reuse
   existing IETF and standardized protocols before specifying new
   protocols.  Besides, Section 4 of this document discusses various
   ways to flatten and distribute current mobility solutions.  Actually,
   nothing prevent the distribution of mobility functions with in IP
   mobility protocols.  However, as discussed in Section 5.1 and
   Section 5.2, limitations exist.  The 3GPP data plane anchoring
   function, i.e., the PGW, can be also be distributed, but with
   limitations; e.g., no anchoring relocation, no context transfer
   between anchors and centralized control plane.  The 3GPP architecture
   is also going into the direction of flattening with SIPTO and LIPA,
   but they do not provide sufficient mobility support.  This is
   identified as a gap and DMM will be a potential solution to fulfill
   this gap.

5.5.  Coexistence with deployed networks/hosts  and operability across
      different networks- REQ5

   According to [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements], DMM implementations must be
   able to co-exist with existing network deployments, end hosts and
   routers, and a DMM solution SHOULD work across different networks,
   possibly operated as separate administrative domains, when the needed
   mobility management signaling, forwarding, and network access are
   allowed by the trust relationship between them.  All current mobility
   protocols can co-exist with existing network deployments and end
   hosts.  There is no gap between existing mobility protocols and this
   requirement.

5.6.  Operation and management considerations - REQ6

   As stated in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements], (1) a DMM solution needs to
   consider configuring a device, monitoring the current operational
   state of a device, responding to events that impact the device,
   possibly by modifying the configuration and storing the data in a



Liu, et al.              Expires January 4, 2015               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft       DMM-best-practices-gap-analysis           July 2014


   format that can be analyzed later. (2) a DMM solution MUST describe
   in what environment and how it can be scalably deployed and managed.
   (3) a DMM solution MUST support mechanisms to test if the DMM
   solution is working properly. (4) a DMM solution SHOULD expose the
   operational state of DMM to the administrators of the DMM entities.
   (5) a DMM solution, which supports flow mobility, SHOULD support
   means to correlate the flow routing policies and the observed
   forwarding actions. (6) a DMM solution SHOULD support mechanisms to
   check the liveness of forwarding path. (7) a DMM solution MUST
   provide fault management and monitoring mechanisms to manage
   situations where update of the mobility session or the data path
   fails. (8) a DMM solution SHOULD be able to monitor usage of DMM
   protocol. (9) DMM solutions SHOULD support standardized configuration
   with NETCONF [RFC6241], using YANG [RFC6020] modules, which SHOULD be
   created for DMM when needed for such configuration.

   Existing mobility management protocols have not thoroughly documented
   the above list of operation and management considerations.  Each of
   the above needs to be considered from the begining in a DMM solution.

   Management information base (MIB) objects are currently defined in
   [RFC4295] for MIPv6 and in [RFC6475] for PMIPv6.  Standardized
   configuration with NETCONF [RFC6241], using YANG [RFC6020] modules is
   needed.

5.7.  Security considerations - REQ7

   As stated in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements], a DMM solution MUST support
   any security protocols and mechanisms needed to secure the network
   and to make continuous security improvements.  In addition, with
   security taken into consideration early in the design, a DMM solution
   MUST NOT introduce new security risks, or amplify existing security
   risks, that cannot be mitigated by existing security protocols and
   mechanisms.

   Current mobility protocols have all security mechanisms in place.
   For example, Mobile IPv6 defines security features to protect binding
   updates both to home agents and correspondent nodes.  It also defines
   mechanisms to protect the data packets transmission for Mobile IPv6
   users.  Proxy Mobile IPv6 and other variations of mobile IP also have
   similar security considerations.

5.8.  Multicast - REQ8

   It is stated in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements] that DMM solutions should
   enable multicast solutions to be developed to avoid network
   inefficiency in multicast traffic delivery.




Liu, et al.              Expires January 4, 2015               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft       DMM-best-practices-gap-analysis           July 2014


   Current IP mobility solutions address mainly the mobility problem for
   unicast traffic.  Solutions relying on the use of an anchor point for
   tunneling multicast traffic down to the access router, or to the
   mobile node, introduce the so-called "tunnel convergence problem".
   This means that multiple instances of the same multicast traffic can
   converge to the same node, diminishing the advantage of using
   multicast protocols.

   The MULTIMOB WG in IETF has studied this issue, for the specific case
   of PMIPv6, and has produced a baseline solution [RFC6224] as well as
   a routing optimization solution [RFC7028] to address the problem.
   The baseline solution suggests deploying an MLD proxy function at the
   MAG, and either a multicast router or another MLD proxy function at
   the LMA.  The routing optimization solution describes an architecture
   where a dedicated multicast tree mobility anchor (MTMA) or a direct
   routing option can be used to avoid the tunnel convergence problem.

   Besides the solutions proposed in MULTIMOB for PMIPv6 within the
   IETF, there are no other solutions for other mobility protocols to
   address the multicast tunnel convergence problem.

5.9.  Summary

   We next list the main gaps identified from the analysis performed
   above:

   o  Existing solutions only provide an optimal initial anchor
      assignment, a gap being the lack of dynamic anchor change/new
      anchor assignment.  Neither the HA switch nor the LMA runtime
      assignment allow changing the anchor during an ongoing session.
      MOBIKE allows change of GW but its applicability has been scoped
      to very narrow use case.

   o  The mobile node needs to simultaneously use multiple IP addresses
      with different properties, which requires to expose this
      information to the mobile node and to update accordingly the
      source address selection mechanism of the latter.

   o  Currently, there is no efficient mechanism specified by the IETF
      that allows to dynamically discover the presence of nodes that can
      play the role of anchor, discover their capabilities and allow the
      selection of the most suitable one.  However, the following
      mechanisms that could help discovering anchors:

   o  Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery (DHAAD): the use of the Home
      Agent (H) flag in Router Advertisements (which indicates that the
      router sending the Router Advertisement is also functioning as a
      Mobile IPv6 home agent on the link) and the MAP option in Router



Liu, et al.              Expires January 4, 2015               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft       DMM-best-practices-gap-analysis           July 2014


      Advertisements defined by HMIPv6.

   o  While existing network-based DMM practices may allow to deploy
      multiple LMAs and dynamically select the best one, this requires
      to still keep some centralization in the control plane, to access
      the policy database (as defined in RFC5213).  Although
      [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip-cp-up-separation] allows a MAG to perform
      splitting of its control and user planes, there is a lack of
      solutions/extensions that support a clear control and data plane
      separation for IETF IP mobility protocols in a DMM context.


6.  Security Considerations

   Distributed mobility management systems encounter same security
   threats as existing centralized IP mobility protocols.  Without
   authentication, a malicious node could forge signaling messages and
   redirect traffic from its legitimate path.  This would amount to a
   denial of service attack against the specific node or nodes for which
   the traffic is intended.  Distributed mobility anchoring, while
   keeping current security mechanisms, might require more security
   associations to be managed by the mobility management entities,
   potentially leading to scalability and performance issues.  Moreover,
   distributed mobility anchoring makes mobility security problems more
   complex, since traffic redirection requests might come from
   previously unconsidered origins, thus leading to distributed points
   of attack.  Consequently, the DMM security design must account for
   the distribution of security associations between additional mobility
   entities.


7.  IANA Considerations

   None.
