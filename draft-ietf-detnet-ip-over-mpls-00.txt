1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by
   a network to DetNet flows.  DetNet provides these flows extremely low
   packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end delivery latency.
   General background and concepts of DetNet can be found in the DetNet
   Architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].

   This document specifies the DetNet data plane operation for IP hosts
   and routers that provide DetNet service to IP encapsulated data.  No
   DetNet specific encapsulation is defined to support IP flows, rather
   existing IP and higher layer protocol header information is used to
   support flow identification and DetNet service delivery.

   The DetNet Architecture decomposes the DetNet related data plane
   functions into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a forwarding
   sub-layer.  The service sub-layer is used to provide DetNet service
   protection and reordering.  The forwarding sub-layer is used to
   provides congestion protection (low loss, assured latency, and
   limited reordering).  Since no DetNet specific headers are added to
   support DetNet IP flows, only the forwarding sub-layer functions are

   supported using the DetNet IP defined by this document.  Service
   protection can be provided on a per sub-net basis using technologies
   such as MPLS [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] and IEEE802.1 TSN.

   This document provides an overview of the DetNet IP data plane over
   MPLS.

3.  DetNet IP Data Plane Overview

   Figure 1 illustrates an IP DetNet, with an MPLS based DetNet network
   as a sub-network between the relay nodes.  It shows a more complex
   DetNet enabled IP network where an IP flow is mapped to one or more
   PWs and MPLS (TE) LSPs.  The end systems still originate IP
   encapsulated traffic that is identified as DetNet flows.  The relay
   nodes follow procedures defined in Section 4 to map each DetNet flow
   to MPLS LSPs.  While not shown, relay nodes can provide service sub-
   layer functions such as PREOF using DetNet over MPLS, and this is
   indicated by the solid line for the MPLS facing portion of the
   Service component.  Note that the Transit node is MPLS (TE) LSP aware
   and performs switching based on MPLS labels, and need not have any
   specific knowledge of the DetNet service or the corresponding DetNet
   flow identification.  See Section 4 for details on the mapping of IP
   flows to MPLS, and [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] for general support of
   DetNet services using MPLS.

4.  IP over DetNet MPLS

   This section defines how IP encapsulated flows are carried over a
   DetNet MPLS data plane as defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].  Since
   both Non-DetNet and DetNet IP packet are identical on the wire, this
   section is applicable to any node that supports IP over DetNet MPLS,
   and this section refers to both cases as DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS.

4.1.  IP Over DetNet MPLS Data Plane Scenarios

   An example use of IP over DetNet MPLS follows below.

                   Figure 2: DetNet IP Over MPLS Network

   Figure 2 illustrates DetNet enabled End Systems (hosts), connected to
   DetNet (DN) enabled IP networks, operating over a DetNet aware MPLS
   network.  In this figure, Relay nodes sit at the boundary of the MPLS
   domain since the non-MPLS domain is DetNet aware.  This figure is
   very similar to the DetNet MPLS Network figure in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].  The primary difference is that the Relay
   nodes are at the edges of the MPLS domain and therefore function as
   T-PEs, and that service sub-layer functions are not provided over the
   DetNet IP network.  The transit node functions show above are
   identical to those described in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].

   Figure 3 illustrates how relay nodes can provide service protection
   over an MPLS domain.  In this case, CE1 and CE2 are IP DetNet end
   systems which are interconnected via a MPLS domain such as described
   in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].  Note that R1 and R3 sit at the edges of
   an MPLS domain and therefore are similar to T-PEs, while R2 sits in
   the middle of the domain and is therefore similar to an S-PE.

   Figure 4 illustrates non-DetNet enabled End Systems (hosts),

   Figure 2 in that the hosts and edge IP networks are not DetNet aware.
   In this case, edge nodes sit at the boundary of the MPLS domain since

   it is also a DetNet domain boundary.  The edge nodes provide DetNet
   service proxies for the end applications by initiating and
   terminating DetNet service for the application's IP flows.  While the
   node types differ, there is essentially no difference in data plane
   processing between relay and edges.  There are likely to be
   differences in controller plane operation, particularly when
   distributed control plane protocols are used.

   Figure 5 illustrates how it is still possible to provided DetNet
   service protection for non-DetNet aware end systems.  This figures is
   basically the same as Figure 3, with the exception that CE1 and CE2
   are non-DetNet aware end systems and E1 and E3 are edge nodes that
   replace the relay nodes R1 and R3.

4.2.  DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS Encapsulation

   The basic encapsulation approach is to treat a DetNet IP flow as an
   app-flow from the DetNet MPLS app perspective.  The corresponding
   example DetNet Sub-Network format is shown in Figure 6.

         Figure 6: Example DetNet IP over MPLS Sub-Network Formats

   In the figure, "IP App-Flow" indicates the payload carried by the
   DetNet IP data plane.  "IP" and "NProto" indicate the fields
   described in Section 7.1.1.  IP Header Information and Section 7.1.2.
   Other Protocol Header Information in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip],
   respectively.  "MPLS App-Flow" indicates that an individual DetNet IP
   flow is the payload from the perspective of the DetNet MPLS data
   plane defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].

   Per [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls], the DetNet MPLS data plane uses a single
   S-Label to support a single app flow.  Section 7.1.  DetNet IP Flow
   Identification Procedures in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip] states that a
   single DetNet flow is identified based on IP, and next level
   protocol, header information.  Section 7.4.  Aggregation
   Considerations in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip] defines that aggregation is
   supported through the use of prefixes, wildcards, bitmasks, and port
   ranges.  Collectively, this results in the fairly straight forward
   procedures defined in this section.

   As shown in Figure 4, DetNet relay nodes are responsible for the
   mapping of a DetNet flow, at the service sub-layer, from the IP to
   MPLS DetNet data planes and back again.  Their related DetNet IP over
   DetNet MPLS data plane operation is comprised of two sets of
   procedures: the mapping of flow identifiers; and ensuring proper
   traffic treatment.

4.3.  DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS Flow Identification Procedures

   A relay node that sends a DetNet IP flow over a DetNet MPLS network
   MUST map that single DetNet IP flow into a single app-flow and MUST
   process that app-flow in accordance to the procedures defined in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] Section 6.1.  PRF MAY be supported for DetNet
   IP flows sent over an DetNet MPLS network.  Aggregation MAY be
   supported as defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] Section 5.4.
   Aggregation Considerations in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip] MAY be used to
   identify an individual DetNet IP flow.  The provisioning of the
   mapping of DetNet IP flows to DetNet MPLS app-flows MUST be supported
   via configuration, e.g., via the controller plane.

   A relay node MAY be provisioned to handle packets received via the
   DetNet MPLS data plane as DetNet IP flows.  A single incoming MPLS
   app-flow MAY be treated as a single DetNet IP flow, without
   examination of IP headers.  Alternatively, packets received via the
   DetNet MPLS data plane MAY follow the normal DetNet IP flow
   identification procedures defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip]
   Section 7.1.  An implementation MUST support the provisioning for
   handling any received DetNet MPLS data plane as DetNet IP flows via
   configuration.  Note that such configuration MAY include support from
   PEOF on the incoming DetNet MPLS flow.

4.4.  DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS Traffic Treatment Procedures

   The traffic treatment required for a particular DetNet IP flow is
   provisioned via configuration or the controller plane.  When an
   DetNet IP flow is sent over DetNet MPLS, a relay node MUST ensure
   that the provisioned DetNet IP traffic treatment is provided at the
   forwarding sub-layer as described in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls]
   Section 5.2.  Note that the PRF function MAY be utilized when sending
   IP over MPLS.

   Traffic treatment for DetNet IP flows received over the DetNet MPLS
   data plane MUST follow Section 7.3 DetNet IP Traffic Treatment
   Procedures in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of DetNet in general are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and [I-D.ietf-detnet-security].  Other
   security considerations will be added in a future version of this
   draft.
