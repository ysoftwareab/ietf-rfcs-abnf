1.  Introduction

   In residential networks, home gateway devices with more than one
   uplink interfaces are used for flexible deployment, bandwidth
   aggregation and reliability purposes.  For example a home gateway
   device may have both fixed and cellular access network interfaces.

   In some rural area with relatively good cellular network coverage
   whilst fibre resources are limited, this kind of device offers
   extremely low-cost and fast deployment for broadband users.  As fibre
   or cable infrastructure reaches these users, the fixed network
   interface can be used as a means of bandwidth aggregation or provide
   higher reliability.

   In contrast, as the access bandwidth gap between the fixed and
   cellular networks is getting closer, it is also attractive for
   current fixed network users to consider using cellular network
   resource as a way to increase the total access bandwidth, or at least
   to boost the access bandwidth for some particular bandwidth-greedy
   services (i.e.HD video call).  This is considered helpful when the
   legacy access infrastructures (i.e. old MMF fibre, coax cable) are
   not able to provide enough bandwidth and the network upgrade is not
   feasible due to environmental or cost issues.  For example, some
   urban area using conventional ADSL for broadband services can use the
   cellular network to achieve higher bandwidth.

   In mif, the network configurations received by different interfaces
   are associated with individual MPvDs.  MPvD labels the node-scoped
   configurations so that the conflict issues stated in ([RFC 6418]) are
   avoided.  Since the network configuration related to a certain
   interface is well maintained by MPvD, an application can choose the

   MPvD to use according to certain node policies if any interface is
   preferred.  Hence, it would be very interesting that MPvD can provide
   link information (i.e. bandwidth, quality and cost), so that an
   application can choose accordingly given that the network
   configuration is valid for corresponding connection.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The terminology and abbreviations used in this document are defined
   in this section.

   o  ISP: Internet Service Provider.  A traditional network operator
      who provides internet access to customers.

   o  VSP: Virtual Service Provider.  An service provider who typically
      provides over-the-top services including but not limited to
      Internet of Things services (IoT).

3.  Bandwidth aggregation for a mif node

   A mif node can use multiple interfaces for bandwidth aggregation
   purposes.  General scenarios are the cases when fixed connection acts
   as a means of bandwidth enhancement for cellular access point and
   vice versa.  In addition, if congestion exists on one of the
   interfaces, the mif node should be able to steer the traffic to the
   preferred link with lighter traffic to achieve improved network
   performance.

   As seen in Figure 1, a multihomed gateway is connected with 2 ISPs
   via fixed and cellular interfaces.  Two individual MPvDs are
   established for these two links.  The traffic can be distributed to
   these two interfaces according to specific node and application
   policies.  This forms the basic system model for bandwidth
   aggregation of a mif node.

3.1.  Bandwidth aggregation for general purposes

   More and more services are provided by ISP and VSPs nowadays.  As an
   example, in addition to providing basic internet services,
   traditional ISPs tend to provide services like IPTV and VoD to
   increase revenue.  Also, VSPs are also seeking opportunities to
   provide attractive IoT service such as home security.  More services
   require more bandwidth.

   There is no doubt that the cutting-edge fibre and coax cable
   technology has enabled broadband services measured by gigabit/s at a
   reasonable cost.  However, ISPs can only provide such high-quality
   internet access to places with newly deployed infrastructures and it
   may take a long time for a customer to be reached by the upgraded
   transport resources.  In contrast, cellular network provides much
   better coverage and potentially access bandwidth comparable with the
   fix network.  Hence, a multihomed device with both fixed and cellular
   connections provides a competitive way for ISPs to solve the problem
   of inadequate bandwidth for some subscribers.

   For a mif node, the fixed and cellular network interfaces have
   individual MPvDs distributed by ISPs.  It is worth to mention that

   these MPvDs may be maintained by different ISPs since one can have
   multiple fixed connections and cellular connections with various
   ISPs.  The subscribers should be able to set different priorities for
   these MPvDs as they like.  For instance, ISPs may provide different
   access network packages but the cellular access is normally more
   expensive compared with the fixed broadband.  Hence, subscriber may
   want to use the cheapest fixed network for most of the time and only
   to activate the more expensive one or the cellular interface when
   there is occasionally need for bandwidth-boost.  Moreover, this
   bandwidth aggregation ability enabled by MPvD also make it possible
   for ISPs and VSPs to provide more flexible services such as time-
   variant price packages and bandwidth boosting plan for targeting
   subscribes.

3.2.  Application-specific traffic-steering

   Some applications may have preferences on what network link to be
   used.  For example, download may want to use an interface with the
   lowest cost and reasonable bandwidth, whereas live video streaming
   application may want to use the most reliable and high speed
   connection.  New services provided by VSPs such as remote surgery and
   HD video conference call may also consider network latency as an
   important factor.  These make the selection of interface critical
   since an improper choice may cause the failure of the application.
   Hence, it is extremely interesting if the interface can identify
   itself for the applications, where the most reasonable choice can be
   made.

   MPvD currently identifies the interfaces with the associated network
   configuration.  It would be interesting if the network status and
   quality information such as available bandwidth, latency and cost
   etc. can also be maintained by MPvDs so that an application can make
   the choice accordingly.

3.3.  Network reliability

   Another interesting scenario for MPvD to support bandwidth
   aggregation is to increase network reliability by providing
   protection connections.  Given that a master interface and a
   protection interface can by identified by MPvD, a PvD-aware node
   should be able to trigger a switching between interfaces and tell the
   application to re-establish its connection.

4.  MPVD support of bandwidth aggregation

   The MPvD should be able to identify the following network status and
   quality information of the associated interface:

   o  Available bandwidth: The guaranteed bandwidth, assured bandwidth
      and best-effort bandwidth of the associated interface

   o  Link cost: The cost of the link measured by the ISP price plan

   o  Latency: The latency of link associated with the corresponding
      interface

   The network status and quality information should be updated by the
   ISP or VSP who maintains the corresponding MPvD.  Applications should
   have access to these information.
