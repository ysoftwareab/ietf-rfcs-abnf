Abstract 

   Usually in FMIPv6, the MN will start the binding process with its 
   home agent and the correspondent nodes after it has attached to NAR. 
   Till the binding is completed, the mobile node continues to receive 
   packets via a reverse tunnel established between PAR and NAR. The 
   duration of this tunnel will depend on the time it takes for the 
   mobile node to complete its binding, till which time the tunnel will

   continue to consume buffer and processing resources related to 
   maintaining the tunnel and forwarding packets through this tunnel in 
   both PAR and NAR.  

   This document specifies an extension to FMIPv6 to enhance its 
   performance, in terms of resource management, by reducing the 
   duration of the tunnel existence. This is achieved by enabling the 
   NAR to act as a proxy for the MN for FMIPv6 handover. Additional 
   message(s) and message options along with modifications to existing 
   FMIPv6 messages and message options and definitions of new messages 
   and message options to achieve the desired functionality is also 
   described in this document.

1. Requirements notation 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1]. 

    
2. Introduction 

   In MIPv6 [2] a Mobile Node (MN) is said to have undergone handover 
   when the Home Agent (HA) and Correspondent Node(s) (CN(s)), upon 
   receiving respective Binding Update (BU) from the MN, successfully 
   create bindings between the MN's Home Address (HoA) and the Care-of 
   Address (CoA) pertaining to the MN new point of attachment and the MN 
   receives Binding Acknowledgements (BAs) from the HA and CN(s) in 
   response to the corresponding BUs. 

   MIPv6 is composed of several delay incurring sub-processes such as 
   Movement Detection, CoA auto-configuration, performing Duplicate 
   Address Detection (DAD) [4] on the newly configured CoA, CoA 
   registration (both with the HA and the CN(s)) and Route Optimization, 
   contributing to the overall handover latency, making MIPv6 unsuitable 
   for real-time communication sessions/streams and for fast moving 
   users undergoing frequent handovers, resulting in packet losses and 
   in worst cases, connection/session timeouts. 

   FMIPv6 is proposed in [3] which aims at reducing the "handover 
   latency" and related "packet losses" by performing operations such as 
   movement detection and new CoA configuration (including DAD for the 
   newly formed Address) in advance, i.e., while the MN is connected to 
   Previous/Present Access Router (PAR) and before it connected to the 
   New/Next Access Router (NAR)(as in predictive handover mode), by 
   creating a reverse tunnel between NAR and PAR to reduce packet 
   losses,  but it does not address the latency that occurs due to 
   process of CoA registration with both the HA and the CN(s). 

   The FMIPv6 protocol also does not specify as to when, how and under 
   what conditions should this bi-directional PAR-NAR tunnel be torn 
   down and how to reduce its duration for resource preservation in both 
   PAR and NAR related to tunneling overhead. 

   This specification addresses these issues by proposing a mechanism of 
   "proactively" carrying out in advance the MN's CoA registration

   process (home registration and correspondent registration) to further 
   optimize the base FMIPv6 protocol.

4. Protocol Overview 

4.1. Handover Latency in Fast MIPv6 

   When a MN moves to a new subnet, it has to establish connection to 
   the NAR of the new subnet and successfully register its NCoA by 
   creating bindings with the CN(s) and the HA before it can start 
   receiving regular traffic from its CN(s) via a direct route, i.e., 
   through a process called route optimization [2]. 

     When the MN moves into a new subnet it has to perform the 
   following tasks before it can resume connection with the CN(s). 

   1. Movement detection 

   2. Neighbor (router/AR) prefix discovery 

   3. NCoA configuration 

   4. DAD performed by the NAR and confirming the validity of the NCoA. 

   5. CoA registry

   6. Home registration and correspondent registration of this NCoA 
      using BU and BA including the regular Return Routability 
      procedure. 

   After the successful completion of the above six tasks, the MN 
   becomes IP-capable on the new link and the MN is said to have 
   undergone handover, whereas the total "handover latency" is the sum 
   of the latencies incurred by each of the above six processes. 

   During this period of handover, the MN is practically disconnected 
   from the HA and the CN(s), this period of disconnection can also be 
   termed as a "blackout" period, and all the packets communicated 
   between the MN and CN(s) are expected to be delayed, lost or in worst 
   cases (in case of TCP timeouts) service disconnection. 

   The degree of packet loss or packet delay is a function of the 
   overall handover latency, and hence is not suitable for fast moving 
   users and /or using real time applications, such as video 
   conferencing. 

   FMIPv6 [3] aims at reducing the handover latency by performing the 
   above five steps in advance while the MN is still connected to PAR, 
   i.e., before the MN travel towards and establishes a L2 connection to 
   the NAR (termed as predictive handover mode), or after it has 
   established a L2 connection with the NAR (termed as reactive handover 
   mode).  

   FMIPv6 also reduces/eliminates the packet loss during the connection 
   blackout time, by establishing a bi-directional tunnel between PAR 
   and NAR. During this blackout period, the traffic from the CN(s) gets 
   delivered to NAR via the PAR through the tunnel where the packets get 
   buffered. When the MN connects to the NAR, all the buffered packets 
   at the NAR and subsequent packets arriving from the CN(s) will get 
   delivered to the MN via the PAR through the PAR-NAR tunnel. The MN 
   after connecting to the NAR will start the MIPv6 binding process [2] 
   with the HA and the CN(s), after the successful completion of which 
   the PAR-NAR tunnel gets torn down and all subsequent communication 
   between the MN and the CN(s) will take place via the NAR.   

4.2. Open Issues in FMIPv6 

   The current FMIPv6 specification [3] does not provide any signaling 
   exchange to inform the PAR that it can stop forwarding packets and/or 
   the tunnel can be released.  



 
 
Yousaf & Wietfeld      Expires January 14, 2009                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft       Proactive Bindings for FMIPv6        July 14, 2008 
    

   Also the duration of the tunnel existence between PAR and NAR is 
   critical in terms of resource management and routing efficiency and 
   this can potentially contribute towards the following: 

   o  Buffer space/resource commitment in both NAR and PAR, which may 
      not scale well in case of an increase in the number of prospective 
      MNs (or when a large number of MNs belonging to the same PAR 
      migrate to the same NAR), a situation typical on a congested 
      highway.  

   o  Duration of tunnel existence will potentially contribute towards 
      packet jitter and delay, which may not favor real time 
      communication sessions and applications. 

   o  Increased processing due to tunneling and de-tunneling of packets 
      at both PAR and NAR and then reverse tunneling of packets during 
      the time when the MN is establishing bindings with its HA and 
      CN(s).    

   o  Possibility of in-efficient routing between MN and respective 
      CN(s) till the tunnel is released and new efficient/shortest path 
      routes between the CN(s) and NAR is calculated by the network. 

   o  In case of high probability of error on the MN-PAR wireless link, 
      the tunnel between PAR and NAR may exist of a longer duration. 

   Thus controlling and minimizing the duration of the tunnel between 
   PAR and NAR holds the key to a better performance of FMIPv6 protocol 
   both in terms of handover latency and efficient management of 
   resources. 

4.3. Proactive Binding for FMIPv6 (PB-FMIPv6) Operation Summary 

   In FMIPv6 [3], the tunnel between PAR and NAR exists till the 
   handover is complete. The handover is said to be complete only when 
   the MN successfully registers its New Care of Address (NCoA) with its 
   corresponding HA and CN(s). 

   The idea behind PB-FMIPv6 is that the registration of the NCoA with 
   its CN(s) and HA is done in advance and in parallel to when the MN is 
   in the process of disconnecting from PAR, connecting to NAR and 
   announcing its presence to NAR by sending Unsolicited Neighbor 
   Advertisement (UNA) message to NAR.  

   The motivation behind this approach is based on the fact that the NAR 
   becomes aware of the NCoA of the MN as early as it receives a 
   Handover Initiate (HI) message from PAR, after which it has every

Internet-Draft       Proactive Bindings for FMIPv6        July 14, 2008 
    

   possibility of proxying for MN and hence proactively perform the 
   requisite bindings on its behalf, while the MN is in the process of 
   moving away from PAR and entering the new subnet and establishing 
   connection with the NAR.  

   It is expected, depending on the speed of the MN, that by the time 
   the MN sends the UNA message to NAR, the NCoA will already be or in 
   the process of getting registered with the HA and the CN(s), 
   afterwards which the tunnel gets released immediately. In essence, 
   PB-FMIPv6 performs the MIPv6 registration process in parallel to the 
   MN's process of moving away from PAR and entering the new subnet and 
   establishing connection with the NAR thereby achieving timing 
   efficiency, which in turn will contribute towards the reduction in 
   PAR - NAR tunnel existence duration and offsetting all the issues 
   related to the extended duration of the PAR-NAR tunnel as outlined in 
   section 4.2. 

4.4. Advantages 

   The reduction in tunnel duration by the proposed mechanism of  
   PB-FMIPv6 is expected to account for the following advantages: 

   o  Resource preservation in case of early release of tunnel 

   o  Resource available for other potential fast moving MNs into the 
      domain 

   o  Early registration of MN's NCoA with the HA and the CN(s) 
      before/shortly after the MN arrives in the new domain. 

   o  Reduction in processing due to tunneling, de-tunneling and reverse 
      tunneling of packets. 

   o  Considerable load reduction on ARs due to reduction in buffer and 
      tunnel maintenance. 

   o  Fully integrated into the present scheme of MIPv6 networks. 

   o  Zero probability of binding messages to be lost over error prone 
      wireless links. 

   o  No added complexity to existing network infrastructure and/or 
      topology. 

   o  Reduction in handover latency.

5. Proactive Binding for FMIPv6 (PB-FMIPv6) Protocol Details 

   In PB-FMIPv6, the NAR is replaced by Proxy-NAR (PrNAR), which is NAR 
   acting as a proxy and performing proactive bindings on behalf of the 
   MN. The protocol operation is shown in figure 2. 

   The protocol operation of the PB-FMIPv6 is similar to that of the 
   base FMIPv6 protocol in which the MN, upon detecting one or more L2 
   ID during its scan operations or upon receiving some link level 
   trigger, will send a RtSolPr message to its access router in order to 
   resolve one or more AP identifiers to subnet-specific information. In 
   response, the PAR will send a PrRtrAdv towards the MN containing one 
   or more [AP-ID, AR-Info] tuples [3]. 

   The MN, based on some network selection criteria, auto-configures a 
   prospective-CoA (PCoA) pertaining to a specific new subnet that it 
   wishes to handover its connection to, and sends a FBU to PAR 
   instructing the PAR to request the PrNAR to proxy on behalf of the 
   MN. The MN will send the FBU with the P-flag set, indicating the MN's 
   request to perform PB-FMIPv6 operation. The FBU will carry the 
   address of the MN's HA in the AHN and the address(es) of the CN(s)in 
   the new Binding Destination Option (see section 6.5.1) and carry the 
   AHoA of the MN in the new Anchor Home Address Option (see section 
   6.5.2). The information carried by these two new options will also 
   convey the complete AHNI profile. 

   The PAR, upon receiving FBU with the P-flag set will send the HI 
   message towards the PrNAR with the P-flag set. The HI message, with 
   the P-flag set, besides carrying the prescribed FMIPv6 options [3] 
   MUST also be appended with an array of IP Address Option carrying the 
   following addresses: 

        1. The AHoA of the MN MUST be included with the Code-Option 
          value set to 4. This address will be subsequently used in the 
          Home Address Destination Option of the BU messages [2] sent 
          by the PrNAR on behalf of the MN. This address is obtained 
          from the Anchor Home Address Option carried by the received 
          FBU message. 

        2. The IP address of the MN's HA at the AHN MUST be included 
          with the Option-Code value set to 5. This address will be 
          subsequently used as the destination address of the IP header 
          of the BU message sent by the PrNAR for Home Registration of 
          the MN. This address is obtained from the Binding Destination 
          Option carried by the received FBU message.

Internet-Draft       Proactive Bindings for FMIPv6        July 14, 2008 
    

        3. The IP address of the CN MAY be included (if the MN is in 
          communication with) with the Option-Code value set to 6. This 
          address will be subsequently used as the destination address 
          of the IP header of the BU message sent by the PrNAR for 
          Correspondent Registration of the MN. The HI message MAY 
          carry none or multiple of such options depending on the 
          number of CN the MN is in communication with. This address is 
          obtained from the Binding Destination Option carried by the 
          received FBU message. 

   The PrNAR upon receiving the HI message with the P-flag set will 
   decide, based on some decision mechanism (such as available 
   resources) but beyond the scope of this document, whether or not to 
   perform proactive bindings on behalf of the MN, and this decision 
   will be conveyed with the P-flag in the HAck message set or unset. In 
   case of the HAck's P-flag unset; normal FMIPv6 process will ensue as 
   specified in [3]. 

   In case the PrNAR has decided to perform proactive bindings for the 
   MN, it will perform DAD on the PCoA and will inform of the NCoA and 
   its ability to proxy for the MN by sending a HAck message back to PAR 
   with its P-flag set. 

   As soon as the PAR receives a HAck, regardless of the status of the 
   P-Flag, a binding between the PCoA and NCoA will be formed inside PAR 
   and also a tunnel will be established between PAR and PrNAR. At the 
   same time, when NCoA has been confirmed by PrNAR, the PrNAR will 
   proactively initiate MIPv6 home registration and correspondent 
   registration process with the MN's HA located in the AHN and the 
   CN(s). The PrNAR will create and maintain a Proxy-Binding Update List 
   (PrBUL) on behalf of the MN. 

   In the meantime, the PAR will send an FBAck informing the MN of its 
   NCoA and the decision of the PrNAR, regarding proxying for the MN, 
   embedded in the status field of the FBAck message. 

   The PrNAR upon receiving BA(s) from the respective HA and the CN(s) 
   will update its PrBUL and will send Proxy Binding Acknowledgement 
   (PrBAck) to the PAR, which will also relay it to the MN (if the MN is 
   still on PAR's link). The PrBAck message besides indicating to the MN 
   about the successful binding on it's behalf is also used as an 
   implicit signal for the release of PAR-PrNAR tunnel. 

   All subsequent packets intended for the MN will now reach PrNAR 
   directly and get buffered. As soon as the MN establishes a L2 
   connection with the PrNAR, it will send an UNA and the PrNAR will

Internet-Draft       Proactive Bindings for FMIPv6        July 14, 2008 
    

   start forwarding all the buffered packets and subsequent packets 
   towards the MN. 

   The MN upon receiving a PrBAck will know that bindings with the HA 
   and CN(s) has been carried out proactively and will send messages 
   with the NCoA as the source address in all subsequent IP 
   transmissions. 

   If the MN has not yet established a L2 connection with the PrNAR when 
   it receives PrBAck, it MUST do so immediately as all transmissions 
   from the CN(s) will now be getting buffered at the PrNAR and any 
   delays on behalf of the MN in establishing connections with the PrNAR 
   can lead to possible delays, buffer overflow and hence packet losses. 

5.1. Processing of Proxy Binding Acknowledgment (PrBAck) Message 

   Since the main motivation behind PB-FMIPv6 is the reduction in the 
   NAR-PrNAR tunnel duration, therefore the timing of the PrNAR's 
   signaling for the release of the tunnel is very important. 

   In principle the tunnel should be released soon after the PrNAR 
   completes the bindings on behalf of the MN and receives the relevant 
   BA(s) from the HA and CN(s). The PrNAR uses the PrBAck message as a 
   tunnel release signal and in addition informs the MN about the 
   successful completion of proactive bindings. 

   The PrNAR will send a PrBAck message for every BA it receives, and 
   eve3ry PrBAck will be appended with the Binding Update Information 
   Option (see section 6.5.3), which will enable a MN to update the 
   corresponding entries in its local Binding Update List cache. The 
   PrBAck corresponding to the last BA will have the tunnel release flag 
   set.  

   Since the BAs from different target nodes may arrive at PrNAR at 
   different times, therefore a separate PrBAck is sent for each BA 
   received and the last PrBAck message will contain the tunnel release 
   signal. Hence the tunnel should not be released until the reception 
   of the last BA. 

   For each BA received, the PrNAR will transmit a PrBAck with the NCoA 
   as the destination IP address on both the local wireless link and on 
   the PAR link via the tunnel. This is done to ensure the reception of 
   the PrBAck message by the MN in situation where the MN may have moved 
   to the PrNAR link before receiving the PrBAck on the PAR's link. The 
   destination address of the outer tunnel packet should be the IP 
   address of the PAR, which upon receiving the PrBAck will release the 
   tunnel, depending on the status of the tunnel release flag and

Internet-Draft       Proactive Bindings for FMIPv6        July 14, 2008 
    

   forward the inner packet (with NCoA as the destination address) on 
   the wireless link. The PAR should create a temporary forwarding state 
   for the NCoA only on the wireless interface till the time it receives 
   a tunnel release signal. The MN will continue to update its local BUL 
   entries with the information carried by the PrBAck message and upon 
   receiving the PrBAck with the tunnel release signal will know that 
   bindings has been completed and it will disconnect from the PAR (if 
   PAR already has not initiated the disconnection of the MN) and will 
   update its local BUL with the information available in the PrBAck    

   If the PrNAR receives UNA from the MN before it has transmitted the 
   last PrBACK (i.e., during the scenario in which the MN attaches to 
   PrNAR before the binding process has completed) then the subsequent 
   PrBAcks should be sent only on the local wireless link with NCoA as 
   the destination IP address and only the last PrBAck, carrying the 
   tunnel release signal should be sent towards PAR as well. This MAY be 
   true for both the predictive and reactive handover modes, but the 
   actual mode of handover depends on the reception of the FBAck message 
   as specified in [3]. For reactive handover modes, i.e. when the MN 
   doesn't receive FBAck on the PAR's link, the handover may be carried 
   out as per the reactive handover mode specified in [3] and the choice 
   of carrying out PB-FMIPv6 handovers may be optional depending on the 
   error probability on the PrNAR's wireless link.

6. Message Formats 

   The PB-FMIPv6 introduces an additional new message called the 
   Proactive Binding Acknowledgement (PrBAck) and two new message 
   options namely Binding Destination Option and Anchor Home Address 
   Option besides necessary modifications to the existing FMIPv6 
   messages and message options.    

6.1. New Proactive Binding Acknowledgement (PrBAck) Message 

   The PrNAR will send a PrBAck message towards the MN for each BA it 
   receives from the HA and the CN(s). The PrBAck not only informs the 
   MN of the successful home and/or correspondent registration but also 
   carries information that is used by the MN to update its local 
   binding update list (BUL). This message is also used as a signal to 
   tear down the PAR-PrNAR tunnel. 

   The format of the message is shown in figure 3.

6.2. Modified Inter-Access Router Messages 

6.2.1. Modified Handover Initiate (HI) Message Format 

   PB-FMIPv6 modifies the format of the Handover Initiate [3] by the

   Upon receiving a HI message, the PrNAR MUST respond with a Handover 
   Acknowledge message, with the appropriate value for the code and P-
   flag. Upon receiving a HI and accepting the MN's proxy request, the 
   PrNAR will create a Proxy Binding Update List (PrBUL), the 
   constitution of which is the same as that of the BUL defined in [2], 
   but with the MN's PAR and/or NAR address as a key to associate the 
   PrBUL contents with the relevant MN(s). This is necessary to handle 
   multiple MN(s) undergoing PB-FMIPv6. The PrNAR will maintain the 
   PrBUL till the MN attaches to it.      

6.3. Modified Mobility Header Messages 

   Mobile IPv6 uses a new IPv6 header type called Mobility Header [2]. 
   The Fast Binding Update, Fast Binding Acknowledgment messages use the 
   Mobility Header. However, PB-FMIPv6 modifies these header messages 
   the relevant details of which are given below. 

6.3.1. Fast Binding Update (FBU) 

   The format of the Fast Binding Update message is modified from the 
   original (see [2]) by the addition of a single flag bit to indicate 
   the MN's request to perform PB-FMIPv6 based handover. 

   The format of the message is shown in figure 6.

                  address(es) to which BUs will be sent. The details 
                  about this new option are given in 6.5.1. 

      Anchor Home Address Option 

                  The FBU MUST contain the Anchor Home Address Option 
                  when the P-flag is set. This option will carry the 
                  AHoA of the MN which will be used in the Home Address 
                  Option of the BU message sent by the NAR on behalf of 
                  the MN. The details about this new option are given in 
                  6.5.2. 

   The combination of the Binding Destination Option and the Anchor Home 
   Address Option provides the complete AHNI profile as well as the 
   destination addresses required by the BU message. The  

   The other valid options to be used are the same as specified in [3].  

6.3.2. Fast Binding Acknowledgment (FBack) 

   The format of the Fast Binding Acknowledgement message is the same 
   but it modifies the interpretation of the existing status values by 
   defining two new status values indicating the NAR's 
   acceptance/rejection to carry out proactive bindings on behalf of the 
   MN's request. The rules for the Mobility Option is also modified. 

   The format of the message is shown in figure 7.

              6    IP address of the CN 
       

   Option codes 4, 5 and 6 MUST be included together when the P-Flag in 
   the FBU and HI is set. 

6.5. New Options 

   PB-FMIPv6 defines three new options, two of which namely the Binding 
   Destination Option and Anchor Home Address Option, is carried by the 
   FBU and encoded within the remaining space of the Message Data field 
   of the FBU, using a type-length-value (TLV) format as specified in 
   [2]. 

   The third new option namely, Binding Update Information Option is 
   carried by the PrBAck message (see section 6.1). 

6.5.1. Binding Destination Option 

   At least one instance of this option MUST be present in the FBU when 
   the P-Flag is set. This option contains the array of address(es), 
   which will be copied into the appropriate options of the HI message, 
   to which the PrNAR will send the bindings to on behalf of the MN. 
   According to normal MIPv6 operations, the MN sends binding updates to 
   the HA and the CN(s) with which a communication session is 
   established. The option type identifies the address to be that of the 
   MN's HA in the AHN or of CN(s). The information contained in the 
   Binding destination option and the Anchor Home Address option (see 
   section 6.5.2) gives complete AHNI profile, which the PrNAR will use 
   for establishing bindings on behalf of the MN. 

   The format of the message is shown in figure 9.
