1. Introduction 
    
   In today's Internet, tunnels are established and activated to provide 
   a facility for conveying a specific traffic from one point to 
   another. The design of such facilities refer to the deployment of a 
   range of IP service offerings, ranging from IP VPN (Virtual Private 
   Networks, [3]) to IP multicast-based services ([4]), like 
   videoconferencing, for example. 
     
   The increasing growth of such advanced services systematically 
   implies the manipulation of a large set of configuration information 
   for the actual engineering, establishment, activation and maintenance 
   of such tunnels.  
    
   This configuration information includes the definition of forwarding 
   and routing schemes (i.e. what kind of traffic should be conveyed by 
   the tunnel, to which destination, etc.), security considerations 
   (identification and authentication of the users who are granted to 
   access the tunnel facility), as well as Quality of Service (QoS) 
   considerations, like the DSCP (DiffServ Code Point, [5]) marking 
   associated to the IP datagrams that are entitled to be forwarded 
   through the tunnel. 
     
   Due to the increased complexity of deploying the corresponding value-
   added IP service offerings, it is important, then, that an interface 
   exists such that tunnel management configuration information can be 
   dynamically provided in a vendor-independent manner, and for a number 
   of services, whatever the underlying technology, and whatever the 
   nature of such services. 
    
   This document is organized into the following sections:

   - Section 3 is the terminology section of the document, where 
     several basic notions have been defined, 
   - Section 4 aims at defining a taxonomy for the various kinds of 
     configuration information that is needed to design, establish, 
     activate and maintain a tunnel, 
   - Section 5 proposes a list of requirements according to the above-
     mentioned taxonomy, 
   - Finally, section 6 aims at describing the functional requirements 
     for a communication protocol that would be the privileged vector 
     for conveying tunnel configuration information. 
 
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6]. 
    
3. Terminology 
    
   This section aims at providing a set of basic definitions for the 
   terms that will be used by this document. 
    
   -  Endpoint: one of the extremities of a tunnel. 
 
   -  Participating device: any networking equipment that will 
      participate in the establishment, the activation and the 
      maintenance of a tunnel. Such devices include routers, whatever 
      the tunneling technique to be used for tunnel construction. 
    
   -  Subscriber: A subscriber (or a customer) is a legal 
      representative who has the (legal) ability to subscribe to a 
      service offering. 
    
   -  Tunnel: a tunnel is a transport facility that is designed to 
      convey (IP) data traffic between one endpoint and another (point-
      to-point tunnels), or between one endpoint and several others 
      (point-to-multipoint) tunnels. Tunnels can be used for different 
      purposes, e.g.: 
    
          - Access IP multicast networks over IP clouds that do not 
            support multicast capabilities, 
          - Access IPv6 networks over IPv4 clouds, 
          - Deploy IP Virtual Private Networks, 
          - Deploy Mobile IP ([7]) architectures. 
    
   -  Tunnel activation: the configuration tasks that position a tunnel 
      facility into an activated state, so that it can be used to 
      convey traffic. Obviously, a tunnel must not (and, hopefully, 
      cannot) be activated before it has been established.

   -  Tunnel establishment: all the configuration tasks that lead to 
      the configuration of a tunnel facility. Once the tunnel is 
      established, it needs to be activated in order to be able to 
      convey traffic. 
    
   -  Tunnel maintenance: the period of time during which a tunnel 
      facility remains activated. 
    
   -  User: A user is an entity (a human being or a process, from a 
      general perspective) who has been named by a subscriber and 
      appropriately identified by a service provider, and whose traffic 
      will be conveyed through a tunnel facility, according to his 
      associated rights and duties. 
    
   -  VPN: Virtual Private Network. A collection of switching resources 
      (namely routers) and transmission resources which will be used 
      over an IP backbone thanks to the establishment and the 
      activation of tunnels, so that they will convey the IP traffic 
      which will reflect the data oriented-communication service of an 
      enterprise (VPNs that are designed to support intranet-based 
      applications) or a set of enterprises (VPNs that are designed to 
      support extranet-based applications). Hence, IP VPN networks are 
      an applicability example of tunnel configuration and management 
      activities. 
    
4. A tentative taxonomy for classifying tunnel configuration information 
    
   For the last decade, the deployment of value-added IP service 
   offerings has yielded the tremendous development of complex 
   configuration information, which ranges from IP address assignment to 
   dynamic key management, not to mention routing strategies and QoS 
   policy enforcement.  
    
   There is a wide variety of advanced IP service offerings - IP VPNs, 
   IP multicast-based services, multimedia services like IP 
   videoconferencing - that rely upon the use of tunnels, because of 
   various motivations: 
    
     1. The need for isolating the traffic that corresponds to the 
        deployment of these services from other traffics, 
     2. The need for preserving the confidentiality of the traffic that 
        will be conveyed over a public IP infrastructure, 
     3. The need for enforcing specific forwarding and routing schemes, 
        because of the (non)-support of specific capabilities, like IP 
        multicast, 
     4. The need for servicing customers according to specific QoS 
        parameters, 
     5. Etc. 
    
   Because of the crucial importance of such tunnels, it seems 
   reasonable to clearly identify what will compose the configuration

Internet Draft   Rqts. for dynamic tunnel configuration        Nov. 2001 
                                     
                                     
   information for the design, the establishment, the activation and the 
   maintenance of these transport facilities. To do so, this document 
   proposes the following taxonomy, while the next sub-sections will 
   elaborate on each of these domains. 
    
   - Architectural considerations: the corresponding tunnel 
     configuration information refers to the very basic information 
     that is needed for the establishment and the activation of the 
     tunnel - namely the identification of the endpoints, the 
     forwarding and routing schemes (including possible traffic 
     engineering capabilities) to be enforced by the devices that will 
     participate in the processing of the traffic conveyed by the 
     tunnel, possibly the identification of the tunnel facility itself. 
    
   - QoS considerations: the associated configuration information is 
     expected to deal with any QoS parameter that the tunnel will have 
     to take into account. This may include the classification of the 
     traffic that will be forwarded through the tunnel, the marking 
     parameters associated to such traffic, the Per-Hop Behavior (PHB, 
     [8]) that will be enforced by the participating routers, etc. 
    
   - Security considerations: any tunnel that may be established and 
     activated by a service provider to convey a specific traffic 
     yields the need for identification and authentication capabilities 
     that will help the service provider in provisioning some 
     guarantees as far as the user identification and authentication 
     are concerned, but also as far as the tunnel resource 
     identification and authentication are concerned. Indeed, the 
     establishment and the activation of a tunnel between two or more 
     endpoints imply that the corresponding devices are granted for 
     supporting tunnel capabilities, but also for any related 
     capability, including route announcement. 
    
   - Management considerations: if (tunnel) configuration is part of 
     the basic management tasks, there is a need for collecting all the 
     relevant statistical information about the tunnels that are under 
     establishment, those that are under activation, those that are up 
     and running, etc. 
    
   According to the following taxonomy, this draft proposes to classify 
   the tunnel configuration information into the following domains: 
    
     1. Architecture, 
     2. Quality of service, 
     3. Security, 
     4. Management. 
    
   The following sections provide elaboration on the corresponding 
   requirements, as far as this tunnel configuration information is 
   concerned.

5. Tunnel configuration information requirements 
    
5.1. Architectural considerations 
    
5.1.1. Tunnel identification information 
    
   The identification of a tunnel should be globally unique, especially 
   if the tunnel is to be established and activated between autonomous 
   systems. The tunnel identification schemes (e.g. endpoint numbering) 
   should be left to service providers, given that the corresponding 
   formalism may be commonly understood, whatever the number of 
   autonomous systems the tunnel may cross. 
    
   The tunnel identification information should at least be composed of 
   the tunnel endpoint identification information. The tunnel 
   identification information may also be composed of an informal 
   description of the tunnel, e.g. the purpose of its establishment, the 
   customer(s) who may use this tunnel, the IP VPN it refers to.  
    
   There may be cases where this additional information is irrelevant, 
   e.g. in the case where the tunnel is expected to convey public 
   Internet traffic, where a user wishes to access IP multicast-based 
   services through non-multicast capable clouds. 
    
5.1.2. Tunneling protocol configuration information 
    
   Any participating device must be provided with the configuration 
   information related to the tunneling technique to be used for the 
   establishment and the activation of the tunnel. Such techniques 
   include Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE, [9]), IP Secure in tunnel 
   mode (IPSec, [10]), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP, [11]), etc. 
    
5.1.3. Routing and forwarding configuration information 
    
   Routing and forwarding configuration information deals with the 
   decision criteria that should be taken by a participating router to 
   forward an incoming IP datagram into the tunnel, according to a given 
   tunnel routing policy. From this perspective, the participating 
   routers should be provided with the following information: 
    
   - In the case of the activation of dynamic routing protocols for the 
     computation and the selection of routes that will be considered 
     for forwarding traffic through the tunnel, the participating 
     router should be provided with the relevant metric information so 
     that, the router (dynamically) assigns the metric values 
     accordingly, 
    
   - In the case where the tunnel is expected to convey traffic across 
     domains, the participating devices should be provided by the 
     relevant BGP-4 (Border Gateway Protocol, version 4, [12])-based 
     reachability information, including the BGP-4 attribute-related

Internet Draft   Rqts. for dynamic tunnel configuration        Nov. 2001 
                                     
                                     
     information that be taken into account by the route selection 
     process of the router to decide whether the corresponding traffic 
     should be conveyed by the tunnel or not, 
    
   - Also, the participating routers should be provided by the 
     configuration information related to any static route that may 
     identify a tunnel endpoint as the next hop to reach a given 
     destination prefix. 
    
5.1.4. Traffic engineering configuration information 
    
   Traffic engineering is an implicit task of tunnel configuration 
   management: within this context, the participating devices should be 
   provided with the configuration information that will help them to 
   choose the appropriate tunnel that leads to a given destination, 
   according to specific constraints. 
    
   These constraints may be expressed in terms of time duration (e.g. 
   the use of a tunnel on a weekly basis), traffic characterization 
   (e.g. all the IP multicast traffic should be conveyed by a specific 
   tunnel), security concerns (e.g. use IPSec tunnels whenever 
   possible), and/or QoS considerations (e.g. EF (Expedited Forwarding, 
   [13])-marked traffic should always use a subset of activated 
   tunnels). 
    
   The enforcement of an IP traffic engineering policy would therefore 
   yield the use of specific tunnels that will be constructed according 
   to the above-mentioned type of configuration information. 
    
5.2. Quality of service considerations 
    
   Tunnels may be established to enforce a QoS policy, and/or tunnels 
   may be established according to QoS parameters. 
    
5.2.1. Tunnel configuration information for QoS policy enforcement 
    
   Service providers may decide to rely upon the use of tunneling 
   techniques to enforce a given QoS policy within a domain. For 
   example, the implementation of an EF PHB by the routers of a DiffServ 
   domain may be tightly related to the establishment and the activation 
   of (a set of) tunnels that will be dedicated to the transportation of 
   EF-marked traffic over the whole domain. 
    
   Therefore, the participating devices should be provided with the PHB-
   related configuration information, DSCP marking, policing and 
   scheduling configuration information that will be associated to the 
   establishment of such tunnels.

Internet Draft   Rqts. for dynamic tunnel configuration        Nov. 2001 
                                     
                                     
5.2.2. QoS parameters as (part of) tunnel configuration information 
    
   On the other hand, a tunnel may be established and activated once the 
   associated QoS-related information has been provisioned to the 
   participating devices. Without any QoS policy consideration, such 
   devices should indeed be provided with the configuration information 
   that may consist of: 
    
   - The DSCP marking associated to the datagrams that may be conveyed 
     by the tunnel, 
   - The scheduling algorithm parameters that will be used by the 
     participating devices to enforce a tunnel-based buffering policy 
     accordingly, 
   - The policing algorithm parameters that will be used by the 
     participating devices to enforce a tunnel-based traffic shaping 
     policy accordingly, 
   - Etc. 
    
   While these parameters may very well be the same as those that have 
   been identified in sub-section 5.2.1.of this draft, the actual usage 
   of these parameters as tunnel configuration information may 
   dramatically differ, depending on domain-wide policy enforcement 
   considerations, or locally-processed configuration information. 
    
5.3. Security considerations 
    
   This section aims at identifying the requirements for the 
   provisioning of the configuration information related to the security 
   associated to the establishment and the activation of tunnels. By 
   "security", this draft basically means: 
    
   - The identification and the authentication of users who may access 
     the tunnel facility, 
   - The identification and the authentication of the switching 
     resources that will not only participate in the establishment and 
     the activation of the tunnel, but also in the route information 
     propagation that may be used by the participating devices to 
     actually forward the corresponding traffic to the tunnel, 
   - Finally, the preservation of the confidentiality of the 
     information that may be conveyed by the tunnel. 
    
   Therefore, the participating devices should be provided with all the 
   appropriate configuration information related to the above-mentioned 
   topics. This does not necessarily mean that the routers will have to 
   maintain a dynamically updated user database, but rather, they should 
   be provided with the following configuration information: 
    
   - The knowledge of the IP networks that may exchange data through 
     the tunnel and/or the configuration information needed for the 
     activation of an identification/authentication mechanism such as 
     RADIUS (Remote Dial-In User Interface, [14]),

   - The knowledge of the participating devices that support the other 
     endpoint(s) of the tunnel and possibly the configuration 
     information related to the activation of a mechanism for 
     identifying and authenticating such peers (based upon the use of 
     an MD5 (Message Digest type 5, [15]) digital signature, for 
     example), 
   - The knowledge of the configuration information needed in the case 
     of using encryption techniques. 
    
5.4. Management considerations 
    
   Service providers who rely upon the use of tunneling techniques for 
   the deployment of a range of IP service offerings will naturally have 
   requirements as far as the usage of these tunnels is concerned. From 
   this perspective, the participating devices should be able to give 
   access to any statistical information related to: 
    
   - The volume of traffic that has been conveyed by the tunnel on a 
     given period of time, including a distinction between incoming and 
     outgoing traffic, 
   - The volume of tunneled traffic that has been dropped by the 
     participating devices on a given period of time,  
   - The IPPM (IP Performance Metrics, [16])-related information that 
     is relevant to the tunnel usage: such information includes the 
     one-way packet delay, the inter-packet delay variation, etc. 
 
6. Functional requirements for a protocol to convey tunnel configuration 
   information 
    
   Although this draft basically focuses on the requirements for 
   providing configuration information related to tunnel establishment, 
   activation and maintenance, it is assumed that this configuration 
   information should be provided to the participating devices by means 
   of a communication protocol that would be used between the 
   aforementioned participating devices and a presumably centralized 
   entity that would aim at storing, maintaining and updating this 
   configuration information - namely a database repository. 
    
   This communication protocol should have the following 
   characteristics: 
    
     1. The protocol should use of a reliable transport mode, given the 
        importance of configuration information, 
     2. The protocol architecture should provide a means for dynamically 
        provision the configuration information to the participating 
        devices, so that it may introduce/contribute to a high level of 
        automation in the actual negotiation and invocation of the 
        corresponding IP service offerings (e.g. the configuration of 
        thousands of IPSec tunnels for the deployment of an IP VPN for a 
        large banking company should NOT be manual anymore),

     3. The protocol should support a reporting mechanism that may be 
        use for statistical information retrieval, 
     4. The protocol should support the appropriate security mechanisms 
        to provide some guarantees as far as the preservation of the 
        confidentiality of the configuration information is concerned. 
    
7. Consistency with some IETF standardization efforts 
    
   It is required that the specification work to be launched around the 
   tunnel configuration topic should be as consistent as possible with 
   any work item of any relevant IETF working group that has identified 
   tunneling techniques as a means for deploying a specific architecture 
   and/or conveying IP traffic. Such working groups include ppvpn and 
   ngtrans. 
    
8. Security Considerations 
    
   This draft has tried to list a set of configuration information that 
   would be required for the establishment, the activation and the 
   management of tunnels to be deployed over public IP infrastructures. 
   As such, it raises the issue of the security associated to the 
   provisioning of such information, by means of a protocol whose some 
   basic characteristics have been identified in the previous section. 
    
   There are also security concerns associated with the propagation of 
   the tunnel provisioning data to the network elements, that must 
   participate in the tunnel establishment and activation procedures, 
   and to the customers (including service providers within an inter-
   domain context) who may access such data. 
    
   A basic recommendation would therefore consist in using the resources 
   of the IPSec protocol suite whenever possible.
