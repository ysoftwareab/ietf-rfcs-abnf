Internet-Draft      HA/LMA data forwarding behaviour        October 2008


Abstract

   In PMIP6-MIP6 interactions scenario C, the HA and LMA are co-located
   and a transition between MIP6 and PMIP6 is supported without breaking
   the session.  This draft discusses possible data forwarding
   behaviours of the co-located HA/LMA in such scenario.  The two
   recently discussed options are: 1) data forwarding always according
   to the mobile node's MIP6 BCE, if exists, which means that MIP6 BCE
   has higher priority than PMIP6 BCE, or 2) data forwarding according
   to type of the last received mobility management registration
   message, i.e., PMIP6 and MIP6 BCE have equal priority.  It is argued
   that option 1) increases handover delay by 1 MN-HA RTT and
   implementation complexity of the HA/LMA may be higher.  Hence, it is
   proposed that HA/LMA should behave according to option 2, i.e., MIP6
   BCE and PMIP6 BCE have same priority and HA/LMA forwards data
   according to the type of the last received mobility management
   registration message.

Internet-Draft      HA/LMA data forwarding behaviour        October 2008


2.  Introduction

   The NETLMM WG has standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213], a Mobile
   IPv6-based protocol for localized mobility management.  This protocol
   allows the network to manage the mobility of mobile nodes.  There are
   various scenarios, in which Mobile IPv6 (MIP6) [RFC3775] and Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 (PMIP6) can be used together.  Three interactions
   scenarios, the corresponding interworking issues and some solutions
   are presented in [ID-MIP-PMIP].

   Recently, alternative solutions for the PMIP6-MIP6 interactions
   scenario C were discussed on the NETLMM mailing list.  In this
   scenario, the HA and LMA are co-located and a transition between MIP6
   and PMIP6 is supported without breaking the session.  This draft
   discusses different options of the external behaviour of the HA/LMA
   in this scenario, more specifically two data forwarding behaviours
   are analyzed.

3.  Higher priority for MIP6 BCE vs. equal priority for PMIP6 BCE and
    MIP6 BCE

   Two possible data forwarding behaviours of the co-located HA/LMA are
   possible in scenario C:

   1.  Data forwarding always according to mobile node's MIP6 BCE, if
       exists (i.e., MIP6 BCE has higher priority than PMIP6 BCE), or

   2.  Data forwarding according to type of the last received mobility
       management registration message (i.e., PMIP6 and MIP6 BCE have
       equal priority).

   With option 1, the HA/LMA forwards data according to mobile node's
   MIP6 BCE and ignores the mobile node's PMIP6 BCE with respect to data
   forwarding, if a MIP6 BCE exists for the mobile node.  Only if no
   MIP6 BCE exists for the mobile node, forwarding is done according to
   the mobile node's PMIP6 BCE.  This implies that MIP6 BCE has higher
   priority than PMIP6 BCE.  The option is proposed in
   [I-D.tsirtsis-logically-separate-lmaha] and is only possible if the
   HA/LMA is implemented in a way that results in separate BCEs for
   PMIP6 and MIP6.

   With option 2, the HA/LMA forwards data according to the type of the
   last received mobility management registration message: If the HA/LMA
   receives a valid PBU, data forwarding is done according to the
   updated mobile node's PMIP6 BCE.  If the HA/LMA receives a valid BU,
   data forwarding is done according to the updated mobile node's MIP6
   BCE.  This implies that PMIP6 and MIP6 have equal priority.  This
   option is possible no matter how HA/LMA is implemented, i.e.,
   separate or shared BCEs for PMIP6 and MIP6.

3.1.  Handover performance considerations

   Figure Figure 1 shows both data forwarding behaviours in case of a
   foreign-to-home handover.  It can be observed that with option 2 data
   forwarding starts once the PBU is received by the HA/LMA, whereas
   with option 1, data forwarding only starts after the BU de-
   registration is received.  This results in a 1 RTT higher handover
   delay with option 1.  Note that this additional handover delay is
   actually unnecessary, since the HA/LMA already has all the
   information about the mobile node's location needed for correct data
   forwarding at the time of receiving the PBU.

                    PMIP6-MIP6 interactions scenario C

   In summay, better handover performance is expected with data
   forwarding option 2.

3.2.  Implementation complexity considerations

   In general, the next hop destination for data forwarding and hence
   the routing table at the HA/LMA can change whenever a PBU or BU is
   received containing a new CoA (or MAG address).

   With option 1), the data forwarding behaviour depends on whether a
   MIP6 BCE exists for the mobile node or not.  This means that when the
   HA/LMA receives a PBU it always needs to check whether a MIP6 BCE
   exists for this mobile node or not in order to be able to make a
   decision about the routing table change.  This translates into a
   dependency between MIP6 and PMIP6 processes in the HA/LMA.

   In contrast, when HA/LMA behaves according to option 2) and receives
   a BU or PBU, there is no need for the PMIP6 process to search for a
   MIP6 BCE of the mobile node or for the MIP6 process to search for a
   PMIP6 BCE of the mobile node, since the forwarding behaviour is
   decided solely based on the type of the received mobility management
   message (PBU or BU).  Thus, option 2) results in no dependency
   between MIP6 and PMIP6 processes with respect to data forwarding.

   Typically, higher dependencies between processes typically result in
   higher implementation complexity.  Hence, it is assumed that option 2
