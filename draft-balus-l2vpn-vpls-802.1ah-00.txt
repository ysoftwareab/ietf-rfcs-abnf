Abstract 

   IEEE 802.1ah draft standard [IEEE802.1ah], also known as Provider 
   Backbone Bridges (PBB) defines an architecture and bridge protocols 
   for interconnection of multiple Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB 
   was defined in IEEE as a connectionless technology based on

   multipoint VLAN tunnels. MSTP is used as the core control plane for 
   loop avoidance, load balancing. As a result the coverage of the 
   solution is limited, service providers avoiding large scale 
   deployments of STP in the core of their network.  

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4762] provides a solution 
   based on superior tunneling capabilities through the use of routed, 
   traffic engineered backbone. As a result VPLS has been deployed on a 
   large scale in service provider networks, providing also for a fully 
   interoperable, extensible model.  

   This draft discusses extensions to VPLS model required to incorporate 
   desirable PBB components while maintaining the Service Provider fit 
   of the initial model.

1. Terminology 

   [IEEE802.1ah] provides terminology for Provider Backbone Bridging. 

   This document defines the following additional terms: 

   B-x: a component of the Backbone domain 

   B-VPLS: a VPLS that operates in the Backbone MAC domain 

   B-VSI: A VPLS Service Instance (VSI) that participates in a B-VPLS 

   B-FEC: A FEC associated with a certain B-VSI association 

   B-PW: A PW interconnecting two B-VSI Instances 

    

   I-x: a component of the customer domain 

   I-VPLS: a VPLS that operates in the customer MAC domain 

   I-VSI: A VPLS Service Instance (VSI) that participates in a I-VPLS 

   I-FEC: A FEC associated with a certain I-VSI association 

   I-PW: A PW interconnecting two I-VSI Instances 

   PBB VPLS: a PBB Service built around a I-VPLS component tunneled 
   potentially through a B-VPLS "tunnel" 

   PBB PE: a PE that contains an I-VSI and a related B-VSI. 

2. Introduction 

   The IEEE model for PBB is organized around a B-component handling the 
   provider backbone MAC layer and an I-component concerned with the 
   Customer MAC domain. PBB encapsulates customer payload in a provider 
   Ethernet header, providing for Customer MAC hiding capabilities.

   PBB requires the use of MSTP as the core control plane (B-domain) for 
   loop avoidance, load balancing. As a result the coverage of the 
   solution is limited, service providers avoiding large scale 
   deployments of STP in the core of their network.  

   VPLS provides a solution based on superior tunneling capabilities 
   through the use of a routed, traffic engineered backbone. VPLS use of 
   the structured FEC 129 [RFC4762] allows for inter-domain, inter-
   provider connectivity. This is an interoperable model, fully tested 
   in large scale deployments. 

   VPLS creates an emulated LAN Segment using as building blocks a set 
   of Virtual Switch Instances (VSIs) interconnected using Virtual Links 
   - i.e. based on Pseudowires or native Ethernet.  

   In a large scale deployment, there might be a need to split the 
   backbone domain into two or more domains using the Hierarchical VPLS 
   (HVPLS) model described in [RFC4762]. This may be required for 
   administrative reasons or to provide efficient handling of packet 
   replication.  

   In this context VPLS scalability may be improved by hiding the 
   customer MAC addresses at the edge PEs so that the core PEs (e.g. PE-
   rs) handle just the Provider MAC addresses.  

   Also a "Backbone VPLS" may be used to handle multiple customer VPNs, 
   improving the speed of provisioning and reducing the number of 
   required PWs. 

   This document proposes simple extensions to the VPLS model to allow 
   for selective inclusion of useful PBB capabilities while avoiding the 
   use of MSTP in the backbone. The proposed architecture accommodates 
   though the use of native Ethernet model, MSTP-based for the PBBN 
   [IEEE802.1ah] should a provider choose to deploy it.  

   The basic functions do not require changes to existing PW, MPLS data 
   or control plane. We are proposing some optional extensions to PW 
   signaling to optimize the MAC Withdraw process and to address flood 
   containment in the backbone VPLS. 

3. Architecture 

   A PBB VPLS may be represented as one or more I-VPLSes interconnected 
   via a Backbone VPLS (B-VPLS) that may be seen as a multi-point 
   tunnel. Inside a particular PBB PE, a "PBB VPLS VSI" may be modeled 
   as an "I-VSI" mapped to a "B-VSI" operating on Customer MAC layer, 
   respectively on the Backbone MAC layer - see Figure 1 below:

   Customer MAC frame into a Provider Ethernet Header and by mapping, 
   the Customer MACs to Backbone MACs. An I-component Service ID (ISID) 
   may be used to provide additional multiplexing capabilities (m:1 
   model).  

   PW or native Ethernet virtual ports may be associated with these 
   entities in Backbone and/or Customer domains. In Figure 1 they are 
   tagged with B-PW/B-ETH, respectively I-PW/I-ETH. Each of these 
   domains may use a full mesh, a hub and spoke topology or a 
   combination as described in [RFC4762].  

   The edge PEs containing both I-VSIs and B-VSIs are equivalent with a 
   PBB IB-BEB - see [IEEE802.1ah]. The core PEs will usually run just 
   the Backbone component (i.e. "B-VSI"), equivalent with a regular VPLS 
   PE operating in the Backbone MAC domain.  

    

4. Deployment Scenarios 

   VPLS is being deployed in the Service Provider networks as a solution 
   for Ethernet Multi-point service spanning multiple network domains: 
   e.g. Metros interconnected via a national/international backbone. 
   Figure 2 shows an example of three VPLS domains where PE 3 and PE4 
   are the core PEs. 

   For some very large VPNs, it may make sense to use a PBB "VPLS VSI" 
   in the edge PEs (1, 2, 5 and 6) to hide the customer MAC addresses 
   from the core PEs.  

   B-PWs are used to provide B-VSI interconnect over a routed, Traffic 
   Engineered backbone between the core B-VSIs e liminating the need for 
   configuring Backbone VLAN IDs (BVIDs) throughout the core.  

   Carrier of Carrier Services may be sold using this additional 
   hierarchy of services where the a Carrier may sell a L2 Service using 
   its MPLS infrastructure but use PBB to separate the addressing of its 
   Carrier customer from its backbone. 

   IEEE 802.1ah specification allows for 1:1 or m:1 I-component(s) to B-
   component mapping. The former option (1:1) may be chosen by a service 
   provider who is content with the level of service multiplexing 
   provided by the B-PWs. In this particular scenario there is no need 
   for using an ISID for identifying the service: i.e. the B-PW fully 
   identifies the end customer VSI (I-VSI). A default ISID value may be 
   used instead.

   Alternatively the ISID may be used to provide an additional level of 
   service multiplexing, on top of the B-PW FEC and service label.  

   There are use cases when the I-VPLS domains that share the same B-
   VPLS overlap but in most practical scenarios that is not the case. A 
   flood containment solution may be required to address the latter 
   scenario (i.e. I-VPLS domains do not overlap). 

   While this iteration of the document is focused on PBB VPLS solution 
   where B-PWs are used as core infrastructure, the model allows for 
   native Ethernet Access (QinQ and/or PBB based) or even a full PBB 
   solution to be deployed using just the I-ETH or B-ETH interconnects 
   between the related I-VSIs and respectively B-VSIs.

   Specific service provider requirements define the reach of PBB and 
   VPLS domains within their networks. It is not in the scope of this 
   document to specify how far PBB and VPLS boundaries extend. 

   The PBB VPLS may co-exist in the same PE with non PBB services: i.e. 
   regular VPLS or VLLs using MPLS PW where PBB MAC hiding or 
   aggregation functions are not required. 

5. Data Plane 

   The core PEs are not PBB aware. Existing VPLS, PWE3 procedures, 
   including Multi-Segment PWs (MS-PW) apply: i.e. just the regular 
   Backbone Ethernet header is used to forward the frames. At the PBB 
   VPLS PEs (BEBs) additional PBB encapsulation/de-encapsulation is 
   required when passing the frame between the I and B components - see 
   [IEEE802.1ah]. Additional ISID look-up is required whenever m:1 I-
   VSIs to B-VSI model is used. 

6. Auto-Discovery 

   Existing VPLS discovery procedures as per [L2VPN-Sig] may be used in 
   the B-VPLS domain and even inside each local I-VPLS domain.  

   End-to-end auto-discovery of I-VPLS instances coincides with BVPLS 
   discovery for the 1:1 I-VSI to B-VSI model.  

7. Signaling 

   The setup of the B-PWs and/or the I-PWs between related VSI entities 
   may be achieved using the existing PWE3 procedures - see [RFC4762]. 
   FEC 128 or FEC 129 may be used to identify each VSI instance 
   accordingly. 

   Lack of congruency between customer VPN domains might determine 
   Service Providers to deploy an 1:1 model (I to B). For this 
   particular scenario, the backbone FEC and related PW Service Labels 
   fully identify the PBB VPLS in the control and data plane. There is 
   no need for the ISID to be configured, signaled or used in the data 
   plane to provide service multiplexing. 

   For the m:1 (I to B) model it is useful to include in the LDP 
   signaling the I-VPLS information associated with the PBB VPLS 
   instances. The ISID information and the associated BMAC on a certain 
   PBB PE (BEB) may be signaled when required using a new LDP TLV, the 
   "PBB TLV".

   This TLV may be used for the m:1 model in conjunction with the B-VPLS 
   FEC TLV to optimize the MAC Address Withdraw and for flood 
   containment in the related B-VPLS infrastructure as described in 
   section 7.1 and 7.2.  

   A suggested PBB TLV structure is given below: 

    0                   1                   2                   3   

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1   

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   

   |1|0|        PBB TLV (TBD)      |           Length              |  

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   | Sub-TLV Type  |    Length     |    Variable Length Value      | 

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   |                         Variable Length Value                 | 

   |                             "                                 | 

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   The PBB sub-TLV type values are TBD. The Lenght field is used to 
   define the length of the PBB sub-TLV including the type and the 
   length itself. Processing of the sub-TLVs should continue when 
   unknown ones are encountered, and they MUST be silently ignored. 

   One or more of the following sub-TLV may be included in the PBB TLV: 

   - I-VPLS ID sub-TLV type 

     A 4 octet value containing the ISID value of the related I-VPLS 

   - B-MAC Address sub-TLV type 

     A 6 octet value containing the BMAC address associated with the I-
     VPLS ID(s).   

 
   Usage of this optional new TLV is specified in the following 
   sections.

               7.1. MAC Address Withdraw 

   The use of Address Withdraw message with MAC List TLV is proposed in 
   [RFC4762] as a way to expedite removal of MAC addresses as the result 
   of a topology change (e.g. failure of a primary link for a dual-homed 
   VPLS capable switch). These existing procedures apply to B-VPLS and 
   I-VPLS domains.  

   When it comes to reflecting access failures across the core (i.e. B-
   VPLS) domain certain additions should be considered as described 
   below.  

   MAC Switching in PBB is based on the mapping of customer MACs to 
   Provider MAC(s). A topology change in the access (I-domain) should 
   generate just the flushing of Customer MAC entries in the PBB PE 
   (BEB) FIB(s) associated with a certain I-VPLS. Further optimizations 
   may consider flushing just the Customer MACs that are mapped to a 
   specific destination BMAC.  

   These goals may be achieved by adding the PBB TLV associated with the 
   affected I-VPLS(s) in the Address Withdraw message to indicate the 
   particular domain requiring MAC flush.  

   At the other end the receiving PBB PEs may use the ISID(s) and/or the 
   BMAC information to flush only the related FIB entry(entries) 
   (customer/I-domain). 

               7.2. Flood Containment in the Backbone VPLS  

   PBB is using a special Backbone Group MAC (BMAC) address every time 
   flooding in the B-domain is required. This BMAC is built (see 
   [IEEE802.1ah]) using a group OUI assigned for PBB usage followed by 
   the ISID value in the last 24 bit of the MAC address. 

   As I-VPLS components are added to a certain Backbone VPLS, the new 
   components identifying the PBB Service Instance may be used to 
   advertise the presence of a specific ISID on a certain PBB PE and 
   throughout the BVPLS core. At the Backbone VPLS PEs, the ISID 
   information may be used to build a flooding tree in the data plane 
   that will deliver traffic through the BVPLS structure just to the PBB 
   PEs where the IVPLS endpoints are present. The dissemination of the 
   ISID information is achieved through the use of PBB TLV.  

   The above procedure assumes the same ISID value is used to identify 
   the customer VPN across the BVPLS domain. Inter-provider scenarios 
   will be discussed in a future version of the document.

8. Multicast Handling 

   PBB MAC hiding may create difficulties for identifying customer 
   Multicast exchanges. It is important to be able to support both 
   regular and PBB VPLSes. That way the customer VPNs requiring large 
   volume of Multicast may be addressed using regular VPLS, allowing for 
   easy multicast snooping throughout the VPLS infrastructure. 

   Alternatively the optimization for Flood Containment may be expanded 
   to allow for efficient Multicast handling in the BVPLS 
   infrastructure: i.e. Group BMAC addresses may be assigned on a per 
   group of Multicast trees sharing the same ISID endpoints. 

9. Resiliency 

   [IEEE802.1ah] recommends the use of Provider MSTP (P-MSTP) to ensure 
   loop free topology for connectionless forwarding through a native PBB 
   core.  

   Using BVPLS infrastructure instead of native Ethernet core eliminates 
   the need for backbone P-MSTP through the use of a full mesh of PWs 
   with split-horizon or via the HVPLS scheme (Primary/Standby PWs) - 
   see [RFC4762]. 

   On the access side, for a PB network or a CE device dually connected 
   to PBB PEs, a loop spanning both I and B domains may occur. An STP-
   based or a local mechanism may be used to break this loop.  

   A solution that does not imply running MSTP end-to-end in the I 
   domain may involve the MAC Withdraw scheme described in the signaling 
   section to speed up data plane convergence. 

10. OAM  

   Existing VPLS OAM tools may be used in each I-VPLS and B-VPLS domain. 
   Details of the required OAM tools and discussion on the correlation 
   between these two domains are out of scope of this draft. 

11. Security Considerations 

   This section will be added in a future version. 

12. IANA Considerations 

   This document proposes the use of a new LDP TLV and related sub-TLV. 
   Suggested values TBD.
