1.  Introduction

   The importation and propagation of BGP routes can be controled using
   Route Targets [RFC4364] and Route Target Constrains [RFC4684].

   A Route Target (RT) could be an 8-octet BGP Extended Community (EC)
   or a 20-octet IPv6 Address Sepcfic EC, though the RT Constrain
   mechanism specified in [RFC4684] was designed for the 8-octet RTs
   only.

   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ipv6-rt-constrain] extends the mechanism to handle
   IPv6 Address Specific RTs by allowing the NLRI prefix to be of 0 to
   24 octets (vs. 0 to 12 octets as in [RFC4684]):

                        +-------------------------------+
                        | origin as        (4 octets)   |
                        +-------------------------------+
                        | route target  (8 or 20 octets)|
                        ~                               ~
                        |                               |
                        +-------------------------------+

   There is a limitation with the approach in [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ipv6-rt-
   constrain] - when the prefix is not more than 12 octets, there is no
   way to determine if the route target part is a partial IPv6 Address
   Sepcific RT or a full/partial AS or IPv4 Address Specific RT.

Internet-Draft                rtc-extension                    July 2020


   Additional types of RTs of arbitrary lengths could also be defined,
   e.g.  [I-D.zzhang-idr-bitmask-route-target].  To extend the RT
   Constrain mechanisms in a generic way so that any forseeable types of
   RTs can be used, this document proposes the extensions specified in
   the following section.

   While the extended mechnism specified in this document can be used
   for existing RTs including IPv6 Address Specific RTs, it is not the
   intention of this document to replace or obsolete the mechansim
   defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ipv6-rt-constrain], given its current
   status and potential existing implementations and deployments.  An
   operator may choose either way as long as there is no ambiguity.

2.  Specification

   To advertise Route Target Membership with various types of RTs, a new
   NLRI encoding with a new SAFI "Extended Route Target constrains" is
   used as following:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |          Origin AS                                            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  Path Attr Type |   Route Target                              ~
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       ~  Route Target (continued, variable length )                   ~
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The one-octet "Path Attr Type" indicates the category of Route Target
   that follows it, using the type of BGP Path Attribute for the RT.
   For example, the "Path Attr Type" is 16 (Extended Community) for
   regular RTs, 25 (IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community) for IPv6
   Address Specific RTs, or 34 (BGP Community Container Attribute) for
   any RT defined as a BGP Community Container (e.g.  [I-D.zzhang-idr-
   bitmask-route-target]).

   Similar to [RFC4684], except for the default route target, which is
   encoded as a zero-length prefix, the minimum prefix length is 40 bits
   - the Origin AS field and the Path Attr Type field cannot be
   interpreted as a prefix.  Route targets MAY then be expressed as
   prefixes, where, for instance, a prefix would encompass all regular
   or IPv6 Address Specific RTs assigned by a given Global
   Administrator.  Semantics of adverising Route Target Membership for
   other types of RTs as prefixes MUST be defined with the specfication
   of those types of RTs.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change security aspects as discussed in
   [RFC4684].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to assign a new SAFI "Extended Route
   Target constrains".
