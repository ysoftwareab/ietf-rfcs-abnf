1.   Introduction 
 
   [DSTE-REQ] presents the Service Providers requirements for support of 
   Diff-Serv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE). This includes the 
   fundamental requirement to be able to enforce different Bandwidth 
   Constraints for different classes of traffic. 
    
   [DSTE-REQ] also defines the concept of Bandwidth Constraints Model 
   for DS-TE and states that "The DS-TE technical solution MUST specify 
   at least one Bandwidth Constraints Model and MAY specify multiple 
   Bandwidth Constraints Models." 
    
   This document provides a detailed description of one particular 
   Bandwidth Constraints Model for DS-TE which is introduced in [DSTE-
   REQ] and called the Russian Dolls Model (RDM).  
    
   [DSTE-PROTO] specifies the IGP and RSVP-TE signaling extensions for 
   support of DS-TE. These extensions support RDM.

3.   Definitions 
    
   For readability a number of definitions from [DSTE-REQ] are repeated 
   here: 
    
   Class-Type (CT): the set of Traffic Trunks crossing a link that is 
   governed by a specific set of Bandwidth Constraints. CT is used for 
   the purposes of link bandwidth allocation, constraint based routing 
   and admission control. A given Traffic Trunk belongs to the same CT 
   on all links.  
    
   TE-Class: A pair of: 
             i. a Class-Type 
            ii. a preemption priority allowed for that Class-Type. This 
                means that an LSP transporting a Traffic Trunk from 
                that Class-Type can use that preemption priority as the 
                set-up priority, as the holding priority or both. 
    
   A number of recovery mechanisms under investigation or specification 
   in the IETF take advantage of the concept of bandwidth sharing across 
   particular sets of LSPs. "Shared Mesh Restoration" in [GMPLS-RECOV] 
   and "Facility-based Computation Model" in [MPLS-BACKUP] are example 
   mechanisms which increase bandwidth efficiency by sharing bandwidth 
   across backup LSPs protecting against independent failures. To ensure 
   that the notion of "Reserved (CTc)" introduced in [DSTE-REQ] is 
   compatible with such a concept of bandwidth sharing across multiple 


 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                           [Page 3] 




                    Russian Dolls Model for DS-TE          March 2004 
 
 
   LSPs, the wording of the "Reserved (CTc)" definition provided in 
   [DSTE-REQ] is generalized into the following:  
    
   Reserved (CTc): For a given Class-Type CTc ( 0 <= c <= MaxCT ) ,let 
   us define "Reserved(CTc)" as the total amount of the bandwidth 
   reserved by all the established LSPs which belong to CTc. 
    
   With this generalization, the Russian Dolls Model definition provided 
   in this document is compatible with Shared Mesh Restoration defined 
   in [GMPLS-RECOV], so that DS-TE and Shared Mesh Protection can 
   operate simultaneously, under the assumption that Shared Mesh 
   Restoration operates independently within each DS-TE Class-Type and 
   does not operate across Class-Types (for example back up 
   LSPs protecting Primary LSPs of CTx must also belong to CTx; Excess 
   Traffic LSPs sharing bandwidth with Backup LSPs of CTx must also 
   belong to CTx). 
    
   We also introduce the following definition: 
    
   Reserved(CTb,q) : let us define "Reserved(CTb,q)" as the total amount 
   of the bandwidth reserved by all the established LSPs which belong to 
   CTb and have a holding priority of q. Note that if q and CTb do not 
   form one of the 8 possible configured TE-Classes, then there can not 
   be any established LSP which belong to CTb and have a holding 
   priority of q, so in that case, Reserved(CTb,q)=0. 
    
 
4.   Russian Dolls Model Definition 
    
   RDM is defined in the following manner: 
             o Maximum Number of Bandwidth Constraints (MaxBC)=  
               Maximum Number of Class-Types (MaxCT) = 8 
             o for each value of b in the range 0 <= b <= (MaxCT - 1): 
                     SUM (Reserved (CTc)) <= BCb, 
                     Where the SUM is across all values of c in the 
                     range b <= c <= (MaxCT - 1) 
            o BC0= Maximum Reservable Bandwidth, so that 
                    SUM (Reserved(CTc)) <= Max-Reservable-Bw,    
                     where the SUM is across all values of c in the  
                     range  0 <= c <= (MaxCT - 1) 
    
   A DS-TE LSR implementing RDM MUST support enforcement of Bandwidth 
   Constraints in compliance with this definition. 
    
   Both preemption within a Class-Type and across Class-Types is 
   allowed. 
    
   Where 8 Class-Types are active, the RDM Bandwidth Constraints can 
   also be expressed in the following way: 
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                           [Page 4] 




                    Russian Dolls Model for DS-TE          March 2004 
 
 
        - All LSPs from CT7 use no more than BC7 
        - All LSPs from CT6 and CT7 use no more than BC6 
        - All LSPs from CT5, CT6 and CT7 use no more than BC5 
        - etc. 
        - All LSPs from CT0, CT1,... CT7 use no more than  
          BC0 = "Maximum Reservable Bandwidth" 
    
   Purely for illustration purposes, the diagram below represents the 
   Russian Dolls Bandwidth Constraints Model in a pictorial manner when 
   3 Class-Types are active: 
    
   I------------------------------------------------------I 
   I-------------------------------I                      I 
   I--------------I                I                      I 
   I    CT2       I    CT2+CT1     I      CT2+CT1+CT0     I 
   I--------------I                I                      I 
   I-------------------------------I                      I 
   I------------------------------------------------------I 
    
   I-----BC2------> 
   I----------------------BC1------> 
   I------------------------------BC0=Max Reservable Bw---> 
    
    
   While simpler Bandwidth Constraints models or, conversely, more 
   flexible/sophisticated Bandwidth Constraints models can be defined, 
   the Russian Dolls Model is attractive in some DS-TE environments for 
   the following reasons: 
       - Although a little less intuitive than the Maximum Allocation 
          Model (see[DSTE-MAM]), RDM is still a simple model to 
          conceptualize. 
       - RDM can be used to simultaneously ensure bandwidth efficiency 
          and protection against QoS degradation of all Class-Types, 
          whether preemption is used or not. 
       - RDM can be used in conjunction with preemption to  
          simultaneously achieve isolation across Class-Types (so that 
          each Class-Type is guaranteed its share of bandwidth no 
          matter the level of contention by other classes), bandwidth 
          efficiency and protection against QoS degradation of all 
          Class-Types.  
       - RDM only requires limited protocol extensions such as the 
          ones defined in [DSTE-PROTO]. 
    
   RDM may not be attractive in some DS-TE environments for the 
   following reasons: 
       - if the usage of preemption is precluded for some 
          administrative reason, while RDM can still ensure bandwidth 
          efficiency and protection against QoS degradation of all CTs, 
          RDM cannot guarantee isolation across Class-Types.

                    Russian Dolls Model for DS-TE          March 2004 
 
 
    
   Additional considerations on the properties of RDM can be found in 
   [BC-CONS] and [BC-MODEL]. 
    
   As a simple example usage of the "Russian Dolls" Bandwidth 
   Constraints Model, a network administrator using one CT for Voice 
   (CT1) and one CT for data (CT0) might configure on a given link: 
        - BC0 = Max-Reservable-Bw= 2.5 Gb/s (i.e. Voice + Data is 
          limited to 2.5 Gb/s) 
        - BC1= 1.5 Gb/s (i.e. Voice is limited to 1.5 Gb/s). 
 
    
5.   Example Formulas for Computing "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" with Russian 
   Dolls Model 
    
   As specified in [DSTE-PROTO], formulas for computing "Unreserved TE-
   Class [i]" MUST reflect all of the Bandwidth Constraints relevant to 
   the CT associated with TE-Class[i], and thus, depend on the Bandwidth 
   Constraints Model. Thus, a DS-TE LSR implementing RDM MUST reflect 
   the RDM Bandwidth Constraints defined in section 4 above when 
   computing "Unreserved TE-Class [i]". 
    
   Keeping in mind, as explained in [DSTE-PROTO], that details of 
   admission control algorithms as well as formulas for computing 
   "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" are outside the scope of the IETF work, we 
   provide in this section, for illustration purposes, an example of how 
   values for the unreserved bandwidth for TE-Class[i] might be computed 
   with RDM, assuming the basic admission control algorithm which simply 
   deducts the exact bandwidth of any established LSP from all of the 
   Bandwidth Constraints relevant to the CT associated with that LSP. 
    
   We assume that: 
        TE-Class [i] <--> < CTc , preemption p> 
   in the configured TE-Class mapping. 
    
   For readability, formulas are first shown assuming only 3 CTs are 
   active. The formulas are then extended to cover the cases where more 
   CTs are used. 
    
   If CTc = CT0, then "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" = 
      [ BC0 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 0 <= b <= 2 
    
    
   If CTc = CT1, then "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" = 
      MIN  [ 
      [ BC1 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 1 <= b <= 2, 
      [ BC0 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 0 <= b <= 2 
             ] 
    
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                           [Page 6] 




                    Russian Dolls Model for DS-TE          March 2004 
 
 
    
   If CTc = CT2, then "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" = 
      MIN  [ 
      [ BC2 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 2 <= b <= 2, 
      [ BC1 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 1 <= b <= 2, 
      [ BC0 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 0 <= b <= 2 
             ] 
    
    
   The formula can be generalized to 8 active CTs and expressed in a 
   more compact way in the following: 
    
     "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" = 
      MIN  [ 
    [ BCc - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and c <= b <= 7, 
    [ BC(c-1) - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and (c-1)<= b <= 7, 
        . . . 
    [ BC0 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 0 <= b <= 7, 
           ] 
      where: 
        TE-Class [i] <--> < CTc , preemption p> 
        in the configured TE-Class mapping. 
    
    
6.   Receiving both Maximum Reservable Bandwidth and Bandwidth Constraints 
   sub-TLVs 
    
   [DSTE-PROTO] states that  
   " A DS-TE LSR which does advertise Bandwidth Constraints MUST use the 
   new "Bandwidth Constraints" sub-TLV (in addition to the existing 
   Maximum Reservable Bandwidth sub-TLV) to do so."  
    
   With RDM, BC0 is equal to the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth since they 
   both represent the aggregate constraint across all Class-Types. Thus, 
   a DS-TE LSR receiving both the "Maximum Reservable Bw" sub-TLV and 
   the new "Bandwidth Constraints" sub-TLV (which contains BC0) for a 
   given link where the RDM model is used, MAY ignore the "Maximum 
   Reservable Bw" sub-TLV. 
    
    
7.   Security Considerations 
    
   Security considerations related to the use of DS-TE are discussed in 
   [DSTE-PROTO]. Those apply independently of the Bandwidth Constraints 
   Model, including RDM specified in this document.

   Renko is also warmly thanked for her instantiation of the Russian

9.   IANA Considerations 
    
   [DSTE-PROTO] defines a new name space for "Bandwidth Constraints 
   Model Id". The guidelines for allocation of values in that name space 
   are detailed in section 14 of [DSTE-PROTO]. In accordance with these 
   guidelines, IANA was requested to assign a Bandwidth Constraints 
   Model Id for RDM from the range 0-127 (which is to be managed as per 
   the "Specification Required" policy defined in [IANA-CONS]). 
    
   Bandwidth Constraints Model Id = TBD was allocated by IANA to RDM. 
    
   <IANA-note> To be removed by the RFC editor at the time of 
   publication 
        We request IANA to assign value 0 for the RDM model. 
      Once the value has been assigned, please replace "TBD" above 
        by the assigned value.

                    Russian Dolls Model for DS-TE          March 2004 
 
 
   This Appendix provides examples of how the Russian Dolls Bandwidth 
   Constraints Model can be used to support each of the scenarios 
   described in [DSTE-REQ]. 
    
1.   Scenario 1: Limiting Amount of Voice 
    
   By configuring on every link:  
        - Bandwidth Constraint 1 (for CT1=Voice) = "certain percentage" 
          of link capacity 
        - BC0 (for CT1=Voice + CT0= Data) =  link capacity 
    
   By configuring: 
        - every CT1/Voice TE-LSP with preemption =0  
        - every CT0/Data TE-LSP with preemption =1 
    
   DS-TE with the Russian Dolls Model will address all the requirements: 
        - amount of Voice traffic limited to desired percentage on 
          every link 
        - data traffic capable of using all remaining link capacity 
        - voice traffic capable of preempting other traffic 
    
2.   Scenario 2: Maintain Relative Proportion of Traffic Classes 
    
   By configuring on every link:  
        - BC2 (for CT2) = e.g. 45% 
        - BC1 (for CT1+CT2) = e.g. 80% 
        - BC0 (for CT0+CT1+CT2) = e.g.100% 
    
   DS-TE with the Russian Dolls Model will ensure that the amount of 
   traffic of each Class Type established on a link is within acceptable 
   levels as compared to the resources allocated to the corresponding 
   Diff-Serv PHBs regardless of which order the LSPs are routed in, 
   regardless of which preemption priorities are used by which LSPs and 
   regardless of failure situations.  
    
   By also configuring: 
        - every CT2/Voice TE-LSP with preemption =0  
        - every CT1/Premium Data TE-LSP with preemption =1  
        - every CT0/Best-Effort TE-LSP with preemption =2 
    
   DS-TE with the Russian Dolls Model will also ensure that: 
        - CT2 Voice LSPs always have first preemption priority in order 
          to use the CT2 capacity 
        - CT1 Premium Data LSPs always have second preemption priority 
          in order to use the CT1 capacity 
        - Best-Effort can use up to link capacity whatever is left by 
          CT2 and CT1.

                    Russian Dolls Model for DS-TE          March 2004 
 
 
   Optional automatic adjustment of Diff-Serv scheduling configuration 
   could be used for maintaining very strict relationship between amount 
   of established traffic of each Class Type and corresponding Diff-Serv 
   resources. 
    
3.   Scenario 3: Guaranteed Bandwidth Services 
    
   By configuring on every link:  
        - BC1 (for CT1) = "given" percentage of link bandwidth 
          (appropriate to achieve the Guaranteed Bandwidth service's 
          QoS objectives) 
        - BC0 (for CT0+CT1) = 100% of link bandwidth 
    
   DS-TE with the Russian Dolls Model will ensure that the amount of 
   Guaranteed Bandwidth Traffic established on every link remains below 
   the given percentage so that it will always meet its QoS objectives. 
   At the same time it will allow traffic engineering of the rest of the 
   traffic such that links can be filled up.
