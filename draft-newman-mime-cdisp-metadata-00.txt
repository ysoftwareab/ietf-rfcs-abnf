Abstract

     The Content-Disposition [CDISP] header defines two disposition
     types:  ''inline'' and ''attachment'' which can affect presentation of
     a MIME [MIME-IMB] body part.  There have been a number of cases
     where one MIME body part contains metadata for another MIME body
     part and is neither suitable for inline display by itself, nor is
     it useful if treated as an independent attachment and saved to a
     file by itself.  If the recipient UA is not familiar with the
     specific media type, the user often is presented with a useless
     unrecognizable attachment.  This memo proposes a third disposition
     type, ''metadata'', to address this situation.

Internet Draft     Metadata Content-Disposition Type       November 1997


1. Conventions Used in this Document

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
     in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
     use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].


2. The Metadata Disposition Type

     A body part can be designated "metadata" if it contains metadata
     for one or more other body parts in the containing multipart and is
     unlikely to be useful if saved to a file by itself or viewed
     independently.  If an interpreting user agent sees an unknown media
     type with a "metadata" disposition type, it SHOULD indicate in some
     way that the body part is unlikely to be useful to the user.

     For example, in a multipart/appledouble [MACMIME], the
     application/applefile body part SHOULD have a "metadata"
     disposition type as it is usually useless by itself.

     In a multipart/security [MIME-SEC], the signature body part is
     usually useless without the text it signs and thus would usually
     have a disposition type of "metadata."


2. Amended Formal Syntax

     This amends the formal syntax [ABNF] for "disposition-type"
     [CDISP]:

         disposition-type =/ "metadata"


3. Security Considerations

     This does not add additional security considerations beyond those
     which already apply to the Content-Disposition header field
     [CDISP].
