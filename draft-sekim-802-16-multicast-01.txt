Abstract

   This draft proposes two types of multicast transport over IEEE 802.16
   networks.  One is deirect mapping for IPv6 CS and the other is
   indirect mapping for both IPv6 over Ethernet CS and IPv6 over VLAN
   CS.  An IPv6 multicast address transmits directly to a CID of IEEE
   802.16 frame in direct mapping scheme.  In indirect mapping, an IPv6
   multicast address uses [RFC2464] and then transmits to a CID of IEEE

1.  Introduction

   The [IEEE802.16] standards specify two modes for sharing wireless
   media.  One is point-to-multipoint(PMP) and the other is mesh.  This
   document focuses on PMP mode.  In PMP mode, uplink supports only
   unicast while downlink supports both unicast and multicast.
   Therefore, [IEEE802.16] is not capable of multicasting in general
   concept which should support both uplink and downlink as [IEEE802.3]
   does.

   [I-D.ietf-16ng-ipv6-over-ipv6cs] describes IPv6 related convergence
   sublayer for unicast.  The multicast transport capabilities are
   important to both control and bearer aspects in Internet Protocol.
   For examples, Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol [RFC0826] for IPv4
   and Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 [RFC2461] require multicast mechanism
   for control aspects.

   The [IEEE802.16] standards specify service specific convergence
   sublayer to process higher-layer protocol data unit based on
   classification.  The types of service specific convergence sublayer
   are asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and packets such as IPv6, IPv4,
   IEEE 802.3/Ethernet, IEEE 802.1Q VLAN, IPv6 over IEEE 802.3/Ethernet,
   IPv6 over IEEE 802.1Q VLAN, IPv4 over IEEE 802.3/Ethernet, IPv4 over
   IEEE 802.1Q VLAN and so on.  A multicast capability depends on the
   convergence sublayer parameters of REGISTRATION message at IEEE
   802.16 MAC messages.  This document describes IPv6 multicast
   [RFC4291] transport over IEEE 802.16 networks in accordance with
   convergence sublayer.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 'RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   shown in Figure 1.  The CRC field is an option.

4.1.  Multicast on IPv6 CS

   IEEE 802.16 MAC header can be divided into two types: generic MAC
   header and MAC header without payload.  The IEEE 802.16 frame with
   H=1, MAC header without payload, does not deliver a payload.

   The Generic MAC header, H=0, begins each MAC PDU containing either
   MAC management messages or CS data .  The IPv6 CS, IPv6 over Ethernet
   CS and IPv6 over IEEE 802.1Q VLAN CS can be a payload of generic MAC.

   The 48 bits MAC address is used to identify a network device and used
   IEEE 802.3 frame format.  However, the IEEE 802.16 frame header does
   not have the MAC address field.  Instead, a CID field in the IEEE
   802.16 frame header performs link layer identification between MS and
   BS.

   An IPv6 CS SHOULD set bit #2 for type 7 in REG-REQ and REG-RSP
   message as specified by [IEEE802.16].  And this CS uses the value 2
   for type 28 in DSx-REQ message.  Figure 3 shows IPv6 CS over IEEE
   802.16 frame.

   IPv6 multicast address for IPv6 CS over IEEE 802.16 frame SHOULD be
   used for multicasting with CID field at the 802.16 frame as shown in
   Figure 4.

                   Figure 4: Direct mapping for IPv6 CS

   The multicast CID, 0XFFA0-0xFEFE, SHOULD use to multicast in IEEE
   802.16 specification.  The other CIDs are multicast polling CID,
   normal mode multicast CID, sleep mode multicast CID, idle mode
   multicast CID, fragmentable broadcast CID and broadcast CID.  It is
   for specific usage and difficult to identify layer 3 multicast
   addresses.

   The information for 802.16 multicast in CID SHOULD use scope field
   and multicast group identifier that specified by [RFC4291].  The
   scope and multicast group identifier are important to identify
   multicast address [IPv6MA].  IPv6 multicast address prefix (0xFF)
   translate to 802.16 CID multicast group (0xFE).

   The flag information on IPv6 multicast address normally uses zero.
   So, 802.16 CID SHOULD not use flag in [RFC4291] for multicast
   mapping.  The scope information on IPv6 multicast address is
   important.  Therefore, 802.16 CID SHOULD use scope information for
   multicasting.

   The last 4 bits in group identifier are important to IPv6 multicast
   address [RFC4291].  The multicast group identifier uses last 4 bits
   to 12 bits based on the purpose.  So, last 4 bits of the IPv6
   multicast group identifier SHOULD use because only 4 bits are
   available at CID.  The duplication of the last 4 bits for multicast
   can resolve by use of scope information.  The unique identification
   to the whole IPv6 multicast address requires modification of such
   specification as [IEEE802.16], [RFC2460], [RFC4291].  Therefore,
   Figure 3 is RECOMMENDED for IPv6 multicast address mapping to 802.16
   CID.

4.2.  Multicast on Ethernet CS and IEEE 802.1Q VLAN CS

   IPv6 over Ethernet CS SHOULD set bit #6 for type 7 in REG-REQ and
   REG-RSP message as specified by [IEEE802.16].  And this CS uses the
   value 6 for type 28 in DSx-REQ message.

   IPv6 over IEEE 802.1Q VLAN CS SHOULD set bit #8 for type 7 in REG-REQ
   and REG-RSP message as specified by [IEEE802.16].  And this CS uses
   the value 8 for type 28 in DSx-REQ message.  Figure 5 shows IPv6 over
   IEEE 802.3/VLAN CS over 802.16 frame.

   IPv6 multicast require at IPv6 over IEEE802.3 or [IEEE802.1Q] VLAN
   CS.  In this case, IPv6 multicast mapping to 802.16 CID SHOULD use
   either direct mapping or indirect mapping.  The direct mapping scheme
   is described in section 4.1.

   IPv6 multicast mapping to CID SHOULD use indirect mapping as
   following.  Firstly, [RFC2464] use for IPv6 multicast address mapping
   to destination address at 802.3 frame.  After that, multicast address
   at 802.3 frame SHOULD translate to 602.16 CID as shown in Figure 6.
   A BS transmit IPv6 multicast packet that destination address start
   with 0X3333 at 802.3 frame for IPv6 over IEEE802.3 or VLAN
