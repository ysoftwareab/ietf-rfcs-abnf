1.  Introduction

   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection ( BFD) [RFC5880] protocol
   operates by transmitting and receiving BFD control packets, generally
   at high frequency, over the datapath being monitored.  In order to
   prevent significant data loss due to a datapath failure, BFD session
   detection time as defined in BFD [RFC5880] is set to the smallest
   feasible value.

   This document proposes a mechanism to detect lost packet in a BFD
   session in addition to the datapath fault detection mechanisms of
   BFD.  Such a mechanism presents significant value to measure the
   stability of BFD sessions and provides data to the operators for the
   cause of a BFD failure.

   This document does not propose any BFD extension to measure data
   traffic loss or delay on a link or tunnel and the scope is limited to
   BFD packets.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   RFC 8174 [RFC8174].

Internet-Draft                BFD Stability                    July 2020


   The reader is expected to be familiar with the BFD [RFC5880],
   Optimizing BFD Authentication
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-optimizing-authentication] and BFD Secure Sequence
   Numbers [I-D.ietf-bfd-secure-sequence-numbers].

3.  Use Cases

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection as defined in BFD [RFC5880] cannot
   detect any BFD packet loss if loss does not last for detection time.
   This document proposes a method to detect a dropped packet on the
   receiver.  For example, if the receiver receives BFD control packet k
   at time t but receives packet k+3 at time t+10ms, and never receives
   packet k+1 and/or k+2, then it has experienced a drop.

   This proposal enables BFD implementation to generate diagnostic
   information on the health of each BFD session that could be used to
   preempt a failure on a link that BFD was monitoring by allowing time
   for a corrective action to be taken.

   In a faulty datapath scenario, an operator can use BFD health
   information to trigger delay and loss measurement OAM protocol
   (Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) or Loss Measurement (LM)-Delay
   Measurement (DM)) to further isolate the issue.

4.  BFD Null-Authentication Type

   The functionality proposed for BFD stability measurement is achieved
   by appending the Null-Authentication type (as defined in Optimizing
   BFD Authentication [I-D.ietf-bfd-optimizing-authentication] ) to the
   BFD control packets that do not have authentication enabled.

5.  Theory of Operation

   This mechanism allows operators to measure the loss of BFD control
   packets.

   When using MD5 or SHA authentication, BFD uses authentication TLV
   that carries the Sequence Number.  However, if non-meticulous
   authentication is being used, or no authentication is in use, then
   the non-authenticated BFD packets MUST include NULL-Auth TLV.

5.1.  Loss Measurement

   Loss measurement counts the number of BFD control packets missed at
   the receiver during any Detection Time period.  The loss is detected
   by comparing the Sequence Number field in the Auth TLV (NULL or
   otherwise) in successive BFD control packets.  The Sequence Number in

   each successive control packet generated on a BFD session by the
   transmitter is incremented by one.

   The first BFD NULL-Auth type processed by the receiver that has a
   non-zero sequence number is used for bootstrapping the logic.  When
   using secure sequence numbers, if the expected values are pre-
   calculated, the value must be matched to detect lost packets as
   defined in BFD secure sequence numbers
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-secure-sequence-numbers].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

7.  Security Consideration

   Other than concerns raised in BFD [RFC5880], Optimizing BFD
   Authentication [I-D.ietf-bfd-optimizing-authentication] and BFD
   Secure Sequence Numbers [I-D.ietf-bfd-secure-sequence-numbers].
   There are no new concerns with this proposal.
