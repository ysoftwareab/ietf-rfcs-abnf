             Uniform Resource Names for Device Identifiers
                       draft-ietf-core-dev-urn-03

Abstract

   This memo describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
   hardware device identifiers.  A general representation of device
   identity can be useful in many applications, such as in sensor data
   streams and storage, or equipment inventories.  A URN-based
   representation can be easily passed along in any application that
   needs the information.

1.  Introduction

   This memo describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC8141]
   [RFC3406] namespace for hardware device identifiers.  A general
   representation of device identity can be useful in many applications,
   such as in sensor data streams and storage, or equipment inventories
   [RFC7252], [RFC8428].  A URN-based representation can be easily
   passed along in any application that needs the information, as it
   fits in protocols mechanisms that are designed to carry URNs
   [RFC2616], [RFC3261], [RFC7252].  Finally, URNs can also be easily
   carried and stored in formats such as XML [W3C.REC-xml-19980210] or
   JSON [RFC8428] [RFC4627].  Using URNs in these formats is often
   preferable as they are universally recognized, self-describing, and

   therefore avoid the need for agreeing to interpret an octet string as
   a specific form of a MAC address, for instance.

   This memo defines identity URN types for situations where no such
   convenient type already exist.  For instance, [RFC6920] defines
   cryptographic identifiers, [RFC7254] defines International Mobile
   station Equipment Identity (IMEI) identifiers for use with 3GPP
   cellular systems, and [I-D.atarius-dispatch-meid-urn] defines Mobile
   Equipment Identity (MEID) identifiers for use with 3GPP2 cellular
   systems.  Those URN types should be employed when such identities are
   transported; this memo does not redefine these identifiers in any
   way.

   Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URNs [RFC4122] are another
   alternative way for representing device identifiers, and already
   support MAC addresses as one of type of an identifier.  However,
   UUIDs can be inconvenient in environments where it is important that
   the identifiers are as simple as possible and where additional
   requirements on stable storage, real-time clocks, and identifier
   length can be prohibitive.  UUID-based identifiers are recommended
   for all general purpose uses when MAC addresses are available as
   identifiers.  The device URN defined in this memo is recommended for
   constrained environments.

   Future device identifier types can extend the device device URN type
   defined here, or define their own URNs.

   Note that long-term stable unique identifiers are problematic for
   privacy reasons and should be used with care or avoided as described
   in [RFC7721].

   The rest of this memo is organized as follows.  Section 3 defines the
   "DEV" URN type, and Section 4 defines subtypes for IEEE MAC-48,
   EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses and 1-wire device identifiers.  Section 5
   gives examples.  Section 6 discusses the security considerations of
   the new URN type.  Finally, Section 7 specifies the IANA registration
   for the new URN type and sets requirements for subtype allocations
   within this type.

2.  Requirements language

3.  DEV URN Definition

   Namespace Identifier: "dev" requested

   Version: 1

   Date: 2018-03-19

   Registration Information: This is the first registration of this
   namespace, 2018-03-19.

   Registrant: IETF and the CORE working group.  Should the working
   group cease to exist, discussion should be directed to the general
   IETF discussion forums or the IESG.

3.1.  Purpose

   Purpose: The DEV URNs identify devices with device-specific
   identifiers such as network card hardware addresses.  These URNs may
   be used in any relevant networks that benefit from the ability to
   refer to these identifiers in the form of URNs; DEV URN is global in
   scope.

   Some typical applications include equipment inventories and smart
   object systems.

   DEV URNs can be used in various ways in applications, software
   systems, and network components, in tasks ranging from discovery (for
   instance when discovering 1-wire network devices or detecting MAC-
   addressable devices on a LAN) to intrusion detection systems and
   simple catalogues of system information.

   While it is possible to implement resolution systems for specific
   applications or network locations, DEV URNs are typically not used in
   a way that requires resolution beyond direct observation of the
   relevant identity fields in local link communication.  However, it is
   often useful to be able to pass device identity information in
   generic URN fields in databases or protocol fields, which makes the
   use of URNs for this purpose convenient.

   The DEV URN name space complements existing name spaces such as those
   involving IMEI or UUID identifiers.  DEV URNs are expeced to be a
   part of the IETF-provided basic URN types, covering identifiers that
   have previously not been possible to use in URNs.

3.2.  Syntax

   Syntax: The identifier is expressed in ASCII characters and has a
   hierarchical structure as follows:

     devurn = "urn:dev:" body componentpart
     body = macbody / owbody / orgbody / osbody / opsbody / otherbody
     macbody = "mac:" hexstring
     owbody = "ow:" hexstring
     orgbody = "org:" number "-" identifier
     osbody = "os:" number "-" serial
     opsbody = "ops:" number "-" product "-" serial
     otherbody = subtype ":" identifier
     subtype = ALPHA *(DIGIT / ALPHA)
     identifier = 1*unreservednout
     product = identifier
     serial = identifier
     unreservednout = ALPHA / DIGIT / "_"
     componentpart = [ "_" component [ componentpart ]]
     component = *1(DIGIT / ALPHA)
     hexstring = hexbyte /
                 hexbyte hexstring
     hexbyte = hexdigit hexdigit
     hexdigit = DIGIT / hexletter
     hexletter = "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f"
     number = *1DIGIT

   The above Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) uses the DIGIT and ALPHA
   rules defined in [RFC5234], which are not repeated here.  The rule
   for pct-encoding is defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC3986].

   The device identity namespace includes three subtypes (see Section 4,
   and more may be defined in the future as specified in Section 7.

   The optional components following the hexstring are strings depicting
   individual aspects of a device.  The specific strings and their
   semantics are up to the designers of the device, but could be used to
   refer to specific interfaces or functions within the device.

   There are no special character encoding rules or considerations for
   comforming with the URN syntax, beyond those applicable for URNs in
   general [RFC8141], or the context where these URNs are carried (e.g.,
   inside JSON [RFC8259] or SenML [RFC8428]).

   The lexical equivalence of the DEV URNs is defined as an exact and
   case sensitive string match.  Note that the two subtypes defined in
   this document use only lower case letters, however.  Future types




Arkko, et al.            Expires April 25, 2019                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                   DEV URN                    October 2018


   might use identifiers that require other encodings that require a
   more full-blown character set (such as BASE64), however.

   DEV URNs do not use r-, q-, or f-components.

   Specific subtypes of DEV URNs may be validated through mechanisms
   discussed in Section 4.

   Finally, the string representation of the device identity URN and of
   the MEID sub namespace is fully compatible with the URN syntax.

3.3.  Assignment

   Assignment: The process for identifier assignment is dependent on the
   used subtype, and documented in the specific subsection under
   Section 4.

   Device identifiers are generally expected to be unique, barring the
   accidental issue of multiple devices with the same identifiers.

   This URN type SHOULD only be used for persistent identifiers, such as
   hardware-based identifiers or cryptographic identifiers based on keys
   intended for long-term usage.

3.4.  Security and Privacy

   Security and Privacy: As discussed in Section 6, care must be taken
   to use device identifier-based identifiers due to their nature as a
   long-term identifier that is often not changeable.  Leakage of these
   identifiers outside systems where their use is justfied should be
   controlled.

3.5.  Interoperability

   Interoperability: There are no specific interoperability concerns.

3.6.  Resolution

   Resolution: The device identities are not expected to be globally
   resolvable.  No identity resolution system is expected.  Systems may
   perform local matching of identities to previously seen identities or
   configured information, however.

3.7.  Documentation

   See RFC NNNN (RFC Editor: Please replace NNNN by a reference to the
   RFC number of this document).

   See Section 1 for a discussion of related name spaces.

3.9.  Revision Information

   Revision Information: This is the first version of this registration.

4.  DEV URN Subtypes

4.1.  MAC Addresses

   DEV URNs of the "mac" subtype are based on the EUI-64 identifier
   [IEEE.EUI64] derived from a device with a built-in 64-bit EUI-64.
   The EUI-64 is formed from 24 or 36 bits of organization identifier
   followed by 40 or 28 bits of device-specific extension identifier
   assigned by that organization.

   In the DEV URN "mac" subtype the hexstring is simply the full EUI-64
   identifier represented as a hexadecimal string.  It is always exactly
   16 characters long.

   MAC-48 and EUI-48 identifiers are also supported by the same DEV URN
   subtype.  To convert a MAC-48 address to an EUI-64 identifier, The
   OUI of the Ethernet address (the first three octets) becomes the
   organization identifier of the EUI-64 (the first three octets).  The
   fourth and fifth octets of the EUI are set to the fixed value FFFF
   hexadecimal.  The last three octets of the Ethernet address become
   the last three octets of the EUI-64.  The same process is used to
   convert an EUI-48 identifier, but the fixed value FFFE is used
   instead.

   Identifier assignment for all of these identifiers rests within the
   IEEE.

4.2.  1-Wire Device Identifiers

   The 1-Wire* system is a device communications bus system designed by
   Dallas Semiconductor Corporation. 1-Wire devices are identified by a
   64-bit identifier that consists of 8 byte family code, 48 bit
   identifier unique within a family, and 8 bit CRC code [OW].

      *) 1-Wire is a registered trademark.

   In DEV URNs with the "ow" subtype the hexstring is a representation
   of the full 64 bit identifier as a hexadecimal string.  It is always
   exactly 16 characters long.  Note that the last two characters

Internet-Draft                   DEV URN                    October 2018


   represent the 8-bit CRC code.  Implementations MAY check the validity
   of this code.

   Family code and identifier assignment for all 1-wire devices rests
   with the manufacturers.

4.3.  Organization-Defined Identifiers

   Device identifiers that have only a meaning within an organisation
   can also be used to represent vendor-specific or experimental
   identifiers or identifiers designed for use within the context of an
   organisation.  Organisations are identified by their Private
   Enterprise Number (PEN) [RFC2578].

4.4.  Organization Serial Numbers

   The "os" subtype specifies an organization and a serial number.
   Organizations are identified by their PEN.

      Note: The DEV URN "os" subtype has originally been defined in the
      LwM2M standard, but has been incorporated here to collect all
      syntax associated with DEV URNs in one place.  At the same time,
      the syntax of this subtype was changed to avoid the possibility of
      characters that are not allowed in SenML Name field (see [RFC8428]
      Section 4.5.1).

4.5.  Organization Product and Serial Numbers

   The DEV URN "ops" subtype has originally been defined in the LwM2M
   standard, but has been incorporated here to collect all syntax
   associated with DEV URNs in one place.  The "ops" subtype specifies
   an organization, product class, and a serial number.  Organizations
   are identified by their PEN.

      Note: As with the "os" subtype, the "ops" subtype has originally
      been defined in the LwM2M standard, and its format has been
      slightly changed.

5.  Examples

   The following three examples provide examples of MAC-based, 1-Wire,
   and Cryptographic identifiers:

                                               # organisation

6.  Security Considerations

   On most devices, the user can display device identifiers.  Depending
   on circumstances, device identifiers may or may not be modified or
   tampered by the user.  An implementation of the DEV URN MUST NOT
   change these properties from what they were intended.  In particular,
   a device identifier that is intended to be immutable should not
   become mutable as a part of implementing the DEV URN type.  More
   generally, nothing in this memo should be construed to override what
   the relevant device specifications have already said about the
   identifiers.

   Other devices in the same network may or may not be able to identify
   the device.  For instance, on Ethernet network, the MAC address of a
   device is visible to all other devices.

   The URNs generated according to the rules defined in this document
   result in long-term stable unique identifiers for the devices.  Such
   identifiers may have privacy and security implications because they
   may enable correlating information about a specific device over a
   long period of time, location tracking, and device specific
   vulnerability exploitation [RFC7721].  Also, usually there is no easy
   way to change the identifier.  Therefore these identifiers need to be
   used with care and especially care should be taken avoid leaking them
   outside of the system that is intended to use the identifiers.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the registration of a new URN namespace for
   "DEV", as described in Section 3.

   Additional subtypes for DEV URNs can be defined through IETF Review
   or IESG Approval [RFC5226].

   Such allocations are appropriate when there is a new namespace of
   some type of device identifiers, defined in stable fashion and with a
   publicly available specification that can be pointed to.

   Note that the organisation (Section 4.3) device identifiers can also
   be used in some cases, at least as a temporary measure.  It is
   preferrable, however, that long-term usage of a broadly employed
   device identifier be registered with IETF rather than used through
   the organisation device identifier type.

Appendix A.  Changes from Previous Version

   Version -03 of the WG draft removed some unnecessary references,
   updated some other references, removed pct-encoding to ensure the DEV
   URNs fit [RFC8428] Section 4.5.1 rules, and clarified that the
   original source of the "os" and "ops" subtypes.

   Version -02 of the WG draft folded in the "ops" and "os" branches of
   the dev:urn syntax from LwM2M, as they seemed to match well what
   already existed in this memo under the "org" branch.  However, as a
   part of this three changes were incorporated:

   o  The syntax for the "org:" changes to use "-" rather than ":"
      between the OUI and the rest of the URN.

   o  The organizations for the "ops" and "os" branches have been
      changed to use PEN numbers rather than OUI numbers [OUI].  The
      reason for this is that PEN numbers are allocated through a
      simpler and less costly process.  However, this is a significant
      change to how LwM2M identifiers were specified before.

   o  There were also changes to what general characters can be used in
      the otherbody branch of the ABNF.

   The rationale for all these changes is that it would be helpful for
   the community collect and unify syntax between the different uses of
   DEV URNs.  If there is significant use of either the org:, os:, or
   ops: subtypes, then changes at this point may not be warranted, but
   otherwise unified syntax, as well as the use of PEN numbers would
   probably be beneficial.  Comments on this topic are appreciated.

   Version -01 of the WG draft converted the draft to use the new URN
   registration template from [RFC8141].

   Version -00 of the WG draft renamed the file name and fixed the ABNF
   to correctly use "org:" rather than "dn:".

   Version -05 made a change to the delimiter for parameters within a
   DEV URN.  Given discussions on allowed character sets in SenML
   [RFC8428], we would like to suggest that the "_" character be used
   instead of ";", to avoid the need to translate DEV URNs in SenML-
   formatted communications or files.  However, this reverses the
   earlier decision to not use unreserved characters.  This also means
   that device IDs cannot use "_" characters, and have to employ other
   characters instead.  Feedback on this decision is sought.

   Version -05 also introduced local or organisation-specific device
   identifiers.  Organisations are identified by their PEN number

   (although we considered FQDNs as a potential alternative.  The
   authors belive an organisation-specific device identifier type will
   make experiments and local use easier, but feedback on this point and
   the choice of PEN numbers vs. other possible organisation identifiers
   would be very welcome.

   Version -05 also added some discussion of privacy concerns around
   long-term stable identifiers.

   Finally, version -05 clarified the situations when new allocations
   within the registry of possible device identifier subtypes is
   appropriate.

   Version -04 is a refresh, as the need and interest for this
   specification has re-emerged.  And the editing author has emerged
   back to actual engineering from the depths of IETF administration.

   Version -02 introduced several changes.  The biggest change is that
   with the NI URNs [RFC6920], it was no longer necessary to define
   cryptographic identifiers in this specification.  Another change was
   that we incorporated a more generic syntax for future extensions;
   non-hexstring identifiers can now also be supported, if some future
   device identifiers for some reason would, for instance, use BASE64.
   As a part of this change, we also changed the component part
   separator character from '-' to ';' so that the general format of the
   rest of the URN can employ the unreserved characters [RFC3986].
