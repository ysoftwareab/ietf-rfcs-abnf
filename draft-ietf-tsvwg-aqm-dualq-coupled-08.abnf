p_C = ( p_CL / k )^2                  (1)

p_C = (p')^2.                         (2)

p_CL = k*p',                          (3)

p_L = max(p'_L, p_CL),                (4)

Tupdate=16ms (as recommended in [RFC8033]) is sufficient.  However
alpha = 2^(-f_C).

U=2, L4S would be a square function and Classic would be quartic.
k=8) would achieve throughput equivalence, and our experiments
