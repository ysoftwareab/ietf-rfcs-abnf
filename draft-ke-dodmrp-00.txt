1. Introduction 
    
   In this draft, we present the design of multicast routing protocol, 
   which embeds the destination-driven idea into an existing on-demand 
   multicast protocol ODMRP [4][5][6] and accordingly the designed 
   protocol is referred to as Destination-driven ODMRP (D-ODMRP) [3]. 
   The design objective is effectively to build a cost-effective mesh-
   based multicast forwarding structure and improves the multicast 
   forwarding efficiency. In D-ODMRP, to build a multicast forwarding 
   structure, the path to reach a multicast destination is biased 
   towards those paths passing through another multicast destination. 
   The destination-driven protocol design is simple and can greatly 
   improve the multicast forwarding efficiency without extra protocol 
   overhead. 
    
2. Protocol Overview 
    
2.1  Overview of ODMRP  
    
   ODMRP is a mesh-based multicast protocol using a forwarding group 
   concept, which is a subset of nodes forwarding multicast packets. A 
   soft state approach is taken in ODMRP to maintain multicast group 
   members, and no explicit control message is required for a node to 
   join or leave the group. The data source establishes and updates 
   group membership and multicast routes. 
    
   In ODMRP, once receiving a non-duplicate Join Query, each node in 
   the network stores the upstream node address (i.e., reverse path 
   learning) into its local route table and rebroadcasts the packet 
   further to its neighbor nodes. When a multicast group member 
   receives the Join Query, it composes a Join Reply packet and sends 
   this packet all the way back to the source along the learned reverse 
   path until reaching a node who has already sent upstream such a 
   Reply or reaching the multicast data source. Nodes on the reverse 
   path is flagged as forwarders (i.e., these nodes are members of the 
   so-called Forwarding Group) and each of them locally keeps a soft 
   state of Forwarding Group flag. During the data transferring phase, 
   nodes in the forwarding group broadcast received multicast packets 
   from the source. 
    
2.2  Destination-Driven Idea 
    
   To realize the destination-driven idea in an on-demand construction 
   of multicast forwarding structure, we modify the procedures for 
   every node to handle received Join Queries in ODMRP. Specifically, 
   we intentionally add extra deferring time at every node receiving a 
   Join Query, and the value of deferring time is set based on how far 
   this received Join Query has left from the last group member that 
   the Join Query has met. In general, the larger this distance is, the

      INTERNET-DRAFT         Destination-Driven ODMRP      November 2008 
 
 
   longer the deferring time will be. This time deferring is to enable 
   those Join Queries taking better routes to travel faster than others, 
   in order to reduce the extra cost for adding new nodes into the 
   forwarding structure.  
    
2.3  Selection of Deferring Timer Values 
    
   In D-ODMRP, when a member node receives a Join Query packet, it 
   further forwards the packet within rand(0, T) time, where T is a 
   system parameter. When a non-member node receives a Join Query, it 
   defers its retransmission with a period of time JQDelay, which is 
   calculated as follows: 
         JQDelay = min{pow(2,ExtraHop)*T, MAX*T}+rand(0, T)     (1) 
   The introduction of MAX is to avoid a non-member node to defer its 
   forwarding of a Join Query with too large delay. 
    
2.4  An Example of Join Query forwarding process

            +-+\                                      -> +-+ 
                \                                    / [2T,5T] 
                 \                                  / 
                  \+-+[0,T]      +-+[2T,T]      +-+[0,T]

                  (1,1)         (2,1)          (3,2)     
                Source: S;  
                Multicast Destinations: A, C and D;  
                Forwarding structure includes S, A, B, C, and D. 
    
   Let us see the above figure as an example of building an efficient 
   forwarding structure. In the figure, node S is the multicast source, 
   and nodes A, C and D are the multicast destinations. The figures in 
   parentheses besides each node represent the hop distance from source 
   and that from the last group member, which Join Query met, to the 
   current node, respectively. The figures in square brackets besides 
   each node represent the deferring time before the node transmitting 
   Join Query. For example, [0, T] besides node A means the deferring 
   time at node A is between 0 and T. The figures in square brackets 
   besides node D represent the total delay time for Join Queries 
   taking the two different paths from S to D.

      INTERNET-DRAFT         Destination-Driven ODMRP      November 2008 
 
 
   To build a forwarding structure, source S floods a Join Query packet 
   across the network. After nodes A and E receive the Join Query, they 
   defer their re-transmissions with different delays. Node E defers 
   its re-transmission with a time of [2T, 3T], and node F defers [4T, 
   5T] time. The Join Query travelling along the path S->E->F->D takes 
   a total delay of [6T, 8T] before reaching D. In contrast, the Join 
   Query traveling along the path S->A->B->C->D takes a total delay of 
   [2T, 5T] before reaching D since nodes A and C are group members of 
   the multicast session. Thus, the Join Query taking the down path 
   will arrive at node D ahead of that taking the upper path. 
   Accordingly, group member D composes a Join Reply according to the 
   Join Query received from C. As a result, only nodes A, B, and C will 
   be flagged as forwarders for the multicast session under 
   investigation. A reduction in the total number of forwarders is 
   achieved. 
    
2.5  Contents of Tables 
    
   Nodes running D-ODMRP are required to maintain the following tables 
   including the specified fields. 
    
2.5.1 Routing Table 
    
   According to D-OMDRP, each node maintains the routing table for 
   providing the next hop information when transmitting Join Replies. 
   When a non-duplicate Join Query is received, an entry of the routing 
   table is inserted or updated. The destination (i.e., the source node 
   of multicast packet) and the next hop to the destination are stored 
   into the routing table. 
    
2.5.2 Forwarding Group Table 
    
   The table is maintained by each multicast forwarder for storing the 
   forwarding group soft state, which records the multicast group ID 
   and the time when the node was last refreshed. 
    
2.5.3 Message Cache 
    
   When a node receives a new Join Query or data, it stores the source 
   address and the unique identifier of the packet. When a new Join 
   Query or data packet is delivered to a node, it stores the source ID 
   and the unique identifier of the packet, and maintains the cache 
   employing scheme of FIFO (First In First Out).Message Cache is 
   maintained to prevent duplicate packet to be sent.

3. Operation 
3.1  Forwarding Group Setup 
3.1.1 Originating a Join Query 
    
   When a source wants to send data packet but has no route to the 
   multicast group, it composes a Join Query packet. The packet must 
   contain the following fields: 
   *  TIME_TO_LIVE_VALUE, is adjusted based on network size. 
   *  Source ID and Last Hop ID, is initially set to the source ID. 
   *  Sequence  Number, must be large enough to prevent wraparound 
      ambiguity 
   *  Hop Count, is initially set to zero. 
   *  Extra Hop, is initially set to zero. 
    
3.1.2 Processing a Join Query 
    
   When a node receives a Join Query packet: 
   1. Check if it is a duplicate by comparing the (Source ID, Sequence 
      Number) combination with the entries in the message cache. If a 
      duplicate, then discard the packet. DONE. 
   2. If it is not a duplicate, insert an entry into the message cache  
      with the information of the received packet (i.e., sequence  
      number and source ID) and insert/update the entry for routing 
      table (i.e., backward learning).  
   3. If the node is a multicast group member, it originates a Join 
      Reply packet. 
   4. Increase the Hop Count field by one and decrease the TTL field by 
      one. If the node is a group member, increase the Cost Hop field by 
      one. 
   5. If the TTL field value is less than or equal to zero, then discard 
      the packet. DONE. 
   6. If the TTL field value is greater than zero, then calculate the 
      delay timer values JQDelay by the equation (1) and set the node ID 
      into Last Hop ID field.  
   7. Broadcast the Join Query packet. DONE. 
    
3.1.3 Originating a Join Reply 
    
   When a multicast group member receives a Join Query, it transmits a 
   Join Reply packet containing each sender ID and next hop ID of a 
   multicast group, which according to the Join Query.  
    
3.1.4 Processing a Join Reply 
    
   When a node receives a Join Reply, it checks Next Hop ID field of 
   the received Join Reply. If one or more entries coincide with the 
   node ID, the node is flagged as forwarding group member, composes a

      INTERNET-DRAFT         Destination-Driven ODMRP      November 2008 
 
 
   new Join Reply, and broadcasts the packet. The next hop node ID can 
   be obtained from the routing table. 
    
3.2  Handling a Multicast Data Packet 
    
   Multicast source broadcasts out data packets to nodes in the 
   forwarding group. When an intermediate node receives a data packet, 
   it first checks the setting of FG_FLAG for the multicast group. If 
   the node is in the forwarding group, it broadcasts the received 
   packet at an instant of rand(0, T) time.
