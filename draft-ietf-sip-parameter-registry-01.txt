Abstract

   This document creates an IANA registry for SIP header field
   parameters. It also lists the already existing parameters to be used
   as initial values for that registry.

1 Introduction

   RFC3261 [1] allows new header field parameters to be defined.
   However, RFC3261 omitted an IANA registry for them. This document
   creates such a registry.

2 Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant SIP implementations.

3 Use of the Registry

   SIP header field parameters MUST be documented in an RFC in order to
   be registered by IANA. This documentation MUST fully explain the
   syntax, intended usage and semantics of the parameter. The intent of
   this requirement is to assure inetroperability between independent
   implementations, and to prevent accidental namespace collisions
   between implementations of dissimialr features.

   RFCs defining SIP header field parameters MUST register them with
   IANA as described below.

   Registered SIP header field parameters are to be considered "reserved
   words". In order to preserve interoperability, registered parameters
   MUST be used in a manner consistent with that described in their
   defining RFC. Implementations MUST NOT utilize "private" or "locally
   defined" SIP header field parameters that conflict with registered
   parameters.

        Note that although unregistered SIP header field parameters
        may be used in implementations, developers are cautioned
        that usage of such parameters is risky. New SIP header
        field parameters may be registered at any time, and there
        is no assurance that these new registered URI parameters
        will not conflict with unregistered parameters currently in
        use.

4 IANA Considerations

   Section 27 of RFC 3261 [1] creates an IANA registry for method names,
   header field names, warning codes, status codes, and option tags.
   This specification instructs the IANA to create a new sub-registry
   under http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters:

        o Header Field Parameters

Internet Draft                    SIP                  November 24, 2003


4.1 Header Field Parameters Sub-Registry

   The majority of the SIP header fields can be extended by defining new
   parameters. New SIP header field parameters are registered by the
   IANA. When registering a new parameter for a header field, the
   following information MUST be provided.

        o Header field in which the parameter can appear.

        o Name of the parameter.

        o A reference to the RFC were the parameter is defined.

   Parameters that can appear in different header fields MAY have the
   same name. However, parameters that can appear in the same header
   field MUST have different names.

   Table 1 contains the initial values for this sub-registry.


4.2 Registration Policy for SIP Header Field Parameters

   As per the terminology in RFC 2434 [3], the registration policy for
   SIP header field parameters shall be "Specification Required".

   For the purposes of this registry, the parameter for which IANA
   registration is requested MUST be defined by an RFC. There is no
   requirement that this RFC be standards-track.

5 Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations associated to this document.
