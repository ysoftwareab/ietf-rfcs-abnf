   Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering
        (RSVP-TE) for Bi-directional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
             draft-bhatia-mpls-rsvp-te-bidirectional-lsp-01

Abstract

   There are several applications that require symmetric Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) path between two points.  This cannot be
   achieved with regular MPLS as the LSPs are unidirectional.  If
   symmetry is required, a separate LSP in each direction is required
   for bidirectional traffic flow.  Generalized MPLS on the other hand,
   has provisions for setting up a bidirectional LSP.  This document
   uses the extensions introduced for GMPLS and applies it to regular
   MPLS for establishing bidirectional LSPs.  Additionally, it also
   describes how bi-directional symmetrical Fast Reroute using both one-
   to-one and facility backup can be achieved.

Internet-Draft          RSVP-TE Bidirectional LSP               May 2011


1.  Introduction

   There are several applications that require symmetrical paths between
   a pair of speakers.  One such application is 1588 [IEEE-1588] which
   requires that the Delay_Resp message takes the same path as the
   associated Delay_Req message.  [I-D.ietf-tictoc-1588overmpls]
   describes a method for transporting PTP messages (PDUs) over an MPLS
   network to enable proper handling of these packets.  Currently, the
   only way to ensure that the different PTP messages follow a
   symmetrical path is by statically configuring the RSVP-TE LSPs.  This
   is unscalable and will not work in case of network failures as MPLS
   FRR may not guarantee symmetrical alternate paths.

   This document describes how RSVP-TE can be used for setting up bi-
   directional LSPs for regular MPLS and the extensions required in FRR
   to ensure that the alternate paths are also symmetrical.


2.  RSVP-TE to signal Bi-directional LSP

   [RFC3473] describes a point-to-point bidirectional LSP mechanism for
   the GMPLS architecture, where a bidirectional LSP setup is indicated
   by the presence of an Upstream Label in the Path message.  The
   Upstream_Label object has the same format as the generalized label,
   and uses Class-Number 35 (of form 0bbbbbbb) and the C-Type of the
   label being used.

   For regular MPLS the Upstream_Label object will be used with C-Type
   value of 1.

   Typically, a node initiates an RSVP session by adding the RRO to the
   Path message.  The initial RRO contains only one subobject - the
   sender's IP addresses.  If the node also desires label recording, it
   sets the Label_Recording flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object.  This
   document extends this mechanism by also adding the Upstream label
   that has been advertised in the RRO subobject.  Thus the initial RRO
   will now contain the sender's IP address and the Upstream label
   advertised by it.  The upstream label subobject in RRO object will be
   with type 0x04 and same C-type with label object.

   It is necessary to ensure the PLR and MP to bind to the same
   bidirectional protection tunnel (bypass tunnel or detour tunnel),
   this draft introduces a new subobject in RRO object to indicate the
   tunnel that PLR or MP binds.

   The tunnel ID and extended tunnel ID is derived from session object,
   LSP ID is derived from sender_template object of protection LSP.


3.  Fast Reroute mechanisms

   [RFC4090] extensions can be used to perform fast reroute for the
   mechanism described in this document when applied within packet
   networks.  This section only applies to LSRs that support [RFC4090].

   This section uses terminology defined in [RFC4090], and fast reroute
   procedures defined in [RFC4090] MUST be followed unless specified
   below.  The head-end and transit LSRs MUST follow the
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE and FAST_REROUTE object processing as specified in
   [RFC4090] for each Path message.

   Since its a bi-directional LSP the detour LSPs and the bypass tunnels
   that are used for the protected LSP must also be bi-directional.
   This is required so that path symmetry is maintained even in an event
   of a network failure.

   It should be noted that in case of bi-directional LSPs, the LSRs
   involved will play the role of both the Point-of-Local-Repair (PLR)
   and Merge Point (MP) at the same time during the failure.  The router
   that is the PLR will become the MP for the traffic thats coming from
   the opposite direction.

   In the Figure 1 assume that ABCD is the protected LSP.  For
   protecting link BC, there is a bidirectional bypass tunnel BEFC (or a
   detour LSP in case of 1-on-1).  B is the PLR and C is the MP for the
   traffic flowing from A towards D and B is the MP, and C the PLR for
   traffic flowing in the opposite direction (from D towards A).

   becomes the MP and D the PLR for traffic flowing in the opposite
   direction (from E towards A).

3.1.  Discovering Upstream Labels

   To support facility backup, the PLR must determine a label that will
   indicate to the MP that packets received with that label should be
   switched along the protected LSP.  This can be done without
   explicitly signaling the backup path if the MP uses a label space
   global to that LSR.

   As described in [RFC4090], the head-end LSR MUST set the "label
   recording requested" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object for LSPs
   requesting local protection.  This will cause (as specified in
   [RFC3209]) all LSRs to record their INBOUND labels and to note via a
   flag whether the label is global to the LSR.  Thus, when a protected
   LSP is first signaled through a PLR, the PLR can examine the RRO in
   the Resv message and learn about the incoming labels that are used by
   all downstream nodes for this LSP.  Similarly the MP, which will
   become the PLR for the reverse direction will learn about the
   upstream labels that are being used by the upstream nodes for this
   LSP by examining the upstream label subobject in RRO in the Path
   message.

   The bypass tunnels and the detour tunnels that are set up for a
   bidirectional LSP must be bidirectional as well.  They can internally
   use the Upstream_label technique that was described earlier to
   establish a bidirectional LSP.

3.2.  Failure detection between PLR and MP

   It is required that PLR and MP should detect the failure at the same
   time, then the two nodes could switch with traffic to the protection
   tunnel (bypass tunnel or detour tunnel) simultaneously.  Such kind of
   detection mechanism could be BFD [RFC5880], RSVP-TE hello, or other
   proper mechanism.

   For the link protection scenario, the detection mechanism should be
   enabled between PLR and MP.  When a failure happens, both PLR and MP
   could detect the failure simultaneously, and switch the traffic to
   the protection tunnel.

   For the node protection scenario, it is required to setup two co-
   related detection sessions.  For the figure2 topology in section 3,
   the PLR node B and MP node D will do the node protection for the
   protected tunnel.  There will be a detection session1 on the link
   between B and C, and session2 between C and D..  When a link failure
   happens between B and C, B could detect the failure by the session1,
   C should notify the link failure event to D by setting the diagnostic
   code to 6 (Concatenated Path Down) in BFD control packet [RFC5880].
   Then D could detect failure through BFD control packets in session 2.

   An alternative way is to do protected LSP segment detection between
   PLR and MP.  When the link or node failed, the protected LSP segment
   detection session will be down, and both PLR and MP could detect the
   failure.


4.  Behavior of various network elements in FRR

   When a failure happens in the network the PLR router closest to the
   failure must perform the traffic protection.  The MP router is the
   router that is the next hop to the failure point and merges the
   protected traffic back to the original path.  In case of
   bidirectional LSPs, the same LSR is PLR in one direction and the MP
   for the other.  Let us examine in detail what each network element
   does for the MPLS FRR.

4.1.  The Head-End Router Behavior

   The Head-End router originates the bi-directional LSP that needs to
   be protected.  It's here that the desired protection type (one-to-one
   or facility backup) is also defined.

   The Path message which has the FRR information in the
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object is propagated from the head-end LSR to the
   Tail router.  Each hop sees the FRR flags and assumes the PLR role



Bhatia, et al.          Expires November 20, 2011               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          RSVP-TE Bidirectional LSP               May 2011


   and tries to establish a bi-directional tunnel.  Every hop reports
   the availability of the FRR protection if its able to establish a bi-
   directional tunnel successfully.  This is done via setting the RRO
   flags in the Resv message.

   When a network failure occurs the PLR, or router upstream of the
   failure to be precise, uses FRR to reroute the traffic around the
   failure, and notifies the head-end LSR by (i) setting the FRR "Local
   protection in use" flag (0x2) in the RRO object of the Resv message
   and (ii) by sending a PathErr message with an ERROR object with code
   0x19 - RSVP Notify Error and error value 0x3 - Tunnel locally
   repaired.  The router that is downstream of the failure
   (traditionally the MP in case of unidirectional LSPs) also uses FRR
   to reroute the traffic around the failure.  It does not send any
   message to the head-end LSR.

   The head-end LSR upon recieving this indication tries to switch the
   traffic to a secondary LSP if its available.  In case its not active,
   the head-end LSR signals this LSP via make-before-break mechanism.

4.2.  The Point of Local Repair (PLR) Behavior

   The PLR router of the protected LSP is also the origination point
   (head-end Router) of the protection tunnel (detour LSP or bypass
   tunnel).  It is also the MP for the reverse protection tunnel at the
   same time.  When an intermediate LSR receives a Path message carrying
   a SESSION_ATTRIBUTE with the FRR flags set, it assumes the role of a
   PLR and starts signaling a bi-directional FRR protection tunnel.  In
   case facility backup is requested by the head-end LSR, the PLR
   signals a new bi-directional tunnel only if a bypass tunnel
   fulfilling the requirements does not already exist.

   In the sections that follow the terms upstream and downstream are
   used in reference to the direction of traffic flow from the head-end
   towards the tail end.  Thus router the tail router is downstream to
   the head-end.

   When a network failure happens, the upstream router local to the
   failure assumes the role of the PLR and switches the traffic to the
   protection tunnel.  This PLR is from now on referred to as the
   "upstream PLR".  The downstream router, local to the failure also
   assumes the role of the PLR and switches the traffic to the
   bidirectional protection tunnel that is set up.  This PLR is referred
   to as the "downstream PLR".  These routers can use either the bi-
   directional detour LSP or a bi-directional bypass tunnel, depending
   upon what was requested by the head-end LSR.

   The egress label that each PLR uses depends upon the kind of

   protection provided.  The subsequent sections only describe the
   behavior of the "upstream PLR" that is different with the protection
   mechanisms as described in [RFC4090].

   Once the traffic gets switched to the protection path, the
   "downstream" PLR does not need to inform the HE router about the
   network failure.

4.2.1.  PLR Behavior during one-to-one backup for a node failure

   For the one-to-one backup, MP should bind the backup tunnel to
   protected LSP before replying the RESV message of detour LSP.  When
   the PLR setup the detour LSP and bind to the protected LSP
   successfully, that also indicates that MP has bound successfully.

   In case of one-to-one backup, the protection or the detour tunnel is
   a regular LSP.  The downstream PLR uses the label that was
   distributed by the immediate upstream router on the detour LSP
   (detour label) to detour traffic arriving from the downstream router
   of the protected LSP.  The label arriving from the immediate
   downstream router of the protected tunnel is swapped with the detour
   label, and the traffic is sent through the detour LSP.

   Upstream_labels advertised when setting up the bi-directional
   protected tunnel ABCDE.

   When a network failure happens, in this case the LSR router between B
   and D fails, the node D will assume the role of a downstream PLR and
   would need to switch the traffic from the protected LSP to the detour
   LSP.  D does this by programming a Swap operation on the egress of
   the protected LSP path to the egress of the detour LSP.  The uL4
   label is thus swapped with udL2 during the failure, instead of label
   uL3.

4.2.2.  PLR Behavior during facility backup for a node failure

   For the facility backup, when the PLR successfully bind the
   protection tunnel to the protected LSP, it SHOULD insert the
   Protection Tunnel subobject in RRO object in the path message, and
   send downstream.

   In the case of facility backup, the data from the protected LSP is
   tunneled through the bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the outer label of
   the tunneled packet in the reverse direction is the label distributed
   by the immediate upstream router of the bypass tunnel.  The
   "downstream PLR" also needs to know what label was expected by the
   router where this tunneled traffic merges (MP) at the upstream.  The
   record label option makes this information available from the RRO in
   the Path messages for the protected LSP.  This is the inner label
   that must be in the tunneled packet.  Thus, the "downstream PLR"
   swaps the incoming label from the immediate downstream router in the
   protected path with these two labels and sends the path through the
   bypass tunnel.

   udL1 is the Upstream_label advertised by B when setting up the bi-
   directional facility bypass tunnel from B to D. Similarly, udL2 is
   the Upstream_label advertised by F to D, when setting up this tunnel.
   uL1, uL2, uL3 and uL4 are the Upstream_labels advertised when setting
   up the bi-directional protected tunnel ABCDE.

   The "downstream" PLR router (D in this case) knows the label (uL2 in
   this case) that the upstream NNHop router expects because it has
   received a Path message which had this Upstream_label recorded in the
   RRO.

   When a network failure happens, in this case the LSR router between B
   and D fails, the node D will assume the role of a "downstream" PLR
   and reroutes the traffic from the protected LSP through the bypass
   tunnel as follows:

   o  PLR D performs a swap operation to change the transport label.
      Since it knows that its doing node protection over the bypass
      tunnel, it will use the label that the NNHop router ("upstream"
      MP) expects instead of the label that the Nhop router (failed LSR)
      expects.  D thus, swaps out uL4 and replaces it with uL2, instead
      of uL3 as it would normally have done.

   o  D also pushes the label udL2 on top of the label stack.  This
      label would be used to switch the packet on the bypass tunnel and
      would finally reach the MP, which happens to be B in our case.

4.3.  The Merge Point (MP) Router Behavior

   The MP router is the LSR where the protection tunnel (detour LSP or
   bypass tunnel) and the protected LSP meet.  It is the termination
   point (Tail router) of the protection tunnel.  For a bi-directional
   protection tunnel the MP router in one direction becomes the PLR in
   the other.

             Fig 5: Merge Points in bi-directional FRR

            ABCDE is a bi-directional protected LSP
            BFD is a bi-directional protection tunnel

   Figure 5 shows two MPs associated with a bi-directional protection
   tunnel.  This document refers to the MP defined in [RFC4090] as a
   downstream MP.  This document does not change the behavior of the
   downstream MP.  This means that it is still responsible for
   maintaining the protection tunnel's state by sending the Resv
   messages to the PLR and is also responsible for maintaining the state
   of the protected tunnel during the network failure.  The upstream MP,
   defined in this document, is not required to do any of these.  Its
   only responsible for merging the reverse traffic back to the
   protected path.

   In one-to-one backup, the tail-end of backup LSP should consider it
   as MP.  When the tail-end receives the Path message, and before
   sending RESV, it should try to bind the backup tunnel to protected
   tunnel.  When binding successfully, MP sends the RESV message
   upstream for the backup tunnel.

   During one-to-one backup the MP performs a swap operation on the
   ingress label of bi-directional detour LSP with the egress label of
   the bi-directional protected LSP.

   In facility protection, when the LSR receives the Path message with
   RRO object, indicating the Previous_Hop or Previous_Previous_Hop with
   Protection Tunnel subobject, it should consider itself as MP.  And it
   SHOULD try to bind the same protection tunnel indicated by Protection
   Tunnel subobject to the protected LSP.  The protection tunnel would
   be expected to be from MP to PLR, with same tunnel-ID and LSP-ID
   indicated by the subobject.

   During facility protection, the traffic arrives with a bypass tunnel
   label.  The MP pops out this label to expose the original protected
   tunnel label that was distributed to the immediate downstream router

   via the Upstream_label mechanism in the Path message on the protected
   tunnel.  Since this label is already programmed, the traffic is
   switched out correctly.

   The Resv message from MP to PLR should be sent in the protection LSP
   since there is a LSP path from MP to PLR.
