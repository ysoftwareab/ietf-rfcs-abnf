 Abstract  
  
 Many services that SIP is anticipated to support require the ability 
 to determine why and how the call arrived at a specific application.  
 Examples of such services include (but are not limited to) sessions 
 initiated to call centers via "click to talk" SIP URLs on a web page, 
 "call history/logging" style services within intelligent "call 
 management" software for SIP UAs and calls to voicemail servers and 
 call centers.  While SIP implicitly provides the redirect/retarget 
 capabilities that enable calls to be routed to chosen applications, 
 there is currently no standard mechanism within SIP for communicating 
 the history of such a request. This "request history" information 
 allows the receiving application to determine hints about how and why 
 the call arrived at the application/user.     
  
 This draft discusses the motivations in support of a mechanism which 
 records the "request history" and proposes detailed requirements for 
 such a generic "request history" capability.

 1. Introduction:  Why define a Generic "Request History" capability? 
  
    SIP implicitly provides redirect/retarget capabilities that enable 
    calls to be routed to specific applications as defined in [1]. The 
    term retarget will be used henceforth in this draft to refer to the 
    process of a Proxy Server/UAC changing a URI in a request and thus 
    changing the target of the request.  This term is chosen to avoid 
    associating this request history only with the specific SIP 
    Redirect Server capability that provides for a response to be sent 
    back to a UAC requesting that the UAC should retarget the original 
    request to an alternate URI.  The rules for determining request 
    targets as described in section 16.5 of [1] are believed to be 
    consistent with the use of the retarget term in this draft. 
     
    The motivation for the request history is that in the process of 
    retargeting old routing information can be forever lost. This lost 
    information may be important history that allows elements to which 
    the call is retargeted to process the call in a locally defined, 
    application specific manner. The proposal in this draft is to 
    provide a mechanism for transporting the request history.  It is 
    not proposing any behavior for a Proxy or UA upon receipt of the 
    information. Indeed, such behavior should be a local decision for 
    the recipient application. 
     
    Current network applications provide the ability for elements 
    involved with the call to exchange additional information relating 
    to how and why the call was routed to a particular destination.  
    The following are examples of such applications:  
    1) Web "referral" applications, whereby an application residing 
      within a web server determines that a visitor to a website has 
      arrived at the site via an "associate" site which will receive 
      some "referral" commission for generating this traffic,  
             
    2) Email forwarding whereby the forwarded-to user obtains a 
      "history" of who sent the email to whom and at what time

    3) Traditional telephony based call redirection services such as 
      Voicemail, call-center "automatic call distribution", and 
      "follow-me" style services. 
      
    Several of the aforementioned applications, and specifically those 
    applications based on email or WWW, define application specific 
    mechanisms through which it is possible to obtain the necessary 
    history information.   
     
    In order to prevent differing proprietary mechanisms emerging to 
    obtain the required "request history" information, it is proposed 
    that the SIPPING WG evaluate the requirements and determine a 
    generic mechanism for the transport of such "request history" 
    information. 
         
 2. Conventions used in this document  
         
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
    this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119. 
         
       
 3. "Request History" Requirements 
  
    The following list constitutes a set of requirements for a "Request 
    History" capability. Note that some of these requirements may be 
    met using existing elements within SIP û whether and what SIP 
    extensions would be needed to meet these requirements is out of 
    scope of this draft. 
     
    The requirements have been enumerated and tagged to facilitate 
    reference to each requirement: 
     
    1) CAPABILITY-req:  The "Request History" capability will provide a 
    capability to inform proxies and UAs involved in processing a 
    request about the history/progress of that request. While this is 
    inherently provided when the retarget is in response to a SIP 
    redirect, it is deemed useful for non-redirect retargeting 
    scenarios, as well.  
     
    2) GENERATION-req: "Request History" information is generated when 
    the request is retargetted [see section 4.1 for further discussion 
    of this requirement].   
     
    3) ISSUER-req: "Request History" information can be generated by a 
    UA, proxy or redirect server. It can be passed in both requests and 
    responses.

    Generic Request History Capability - Requirements           June 2002 
  
  
    4) CONTENT-req:  The "Request History" information for each 
    occurrence of retargeting, shall include the following: 
     
      4.1) The new URI or address to which the request is in the 
    process of being retargeted 
       
      4.2) The URI or address from which the request was retargeted. 
       
      4.3) The reason for the Request-URI modification [See section 4.2 
      for further description of this requirement]. 
       
      4.4) Chronological ordering of the Request History information.   
     
    5) REQUEST-VALIDITY-req:  Request-History is applicable to requests 
    not sent within an established dialog. (i.e. INVITE, REGISTER, 
    MESSAGE, and OPTIONS).  
     
    6) BACKWARDS-req: Request-History information may be passed from 
    the generating entity backwards towards the UAC. This is needed to 
    enable services which inform the calling party about the dialog 
    establishment attempts.    
     
    7) FORWARDS-req:  Request-History information may also be included 
    by the generating entity in the request, if it is forwarded 
    onwards. 
     
    8) REDIRECT-RESP-req:  An entity (UA or proxy) retargeting in 
    response to a redirect or REFER shall include any Request History 
    information from the redirect/REFER in the new request.  
  
 4. Further Requirements Related Considerations 
     
    This section of the document further addresses some concerns that 
    arise out of the Requirements specification in section 3.  
  
    4.1 Further considerations for capturing retargeting 
     
    The original request URI of a retargeted request SHOULD identify 
    the user, service or resource, which performed the retargeting, as 
    captured in requirement 4.2 in section 3. In some scenarios, it 
    might be possible for more than one instance of retargeting to 
    occur within the same Proxy.  It is recommended that a proxy SHOULD 
    NOT 'internally retarget' a request to a different user, service or 
    resource on the same proxy, without generating Request History 
    information for the 'internal retargeting' as well. It should be 
    highlighted that an underlying requirement is to ensure that any 
    retargeting maintains the privacy associated with the original 
    Request URI. This requirement is addressed, along with additional 
    security specific requirements in Section 5.

    4.2 Reason for retargeting 
     
    The reason for the retargeting is only known to the application 
    performing the retargeting.  However, it does make sense to define 
    a set of reasons, which will be commonly required.  It is proposed 
    that [6] provides a reasonable starting point for the definition 
    for the set of reasons.  
     
    4.3 Optionality of the "Request History" capability 
     
    Requirement 2 in section 3 specifies that "Request History" 
    information is generated when the request is retargeted.  In many 
    cases, it is anticipated that whether the history is added to the 
    Request would be a local policy decision enforced by the specific 
    application, thus no specific protocol element is needed.  However, 
    due to the capability being "optional" from the SIP protocol 
    perspective, the impact to an application of not having the 
    "Request History" must be described. For example, in a scenario 
    where there is sequential forking and retargeting, some of the 
    destinations previously tried could be retried. The impact of not 
    having the "Request History" information for this sample 
    application is that routing is inefficient.  However, another 
    scenario involving a voicemail application, the impact of not 
    having the "Request History" information would be the service could 
    not operate without having the information as to why the call was 
    retargeted and the initial target for the call. Thus, the 
    expectation would be that the policy in a system that intended to 
    support this voicemail application would have to require the 
    entities within its domain which are capable of retargeting to 
    capture "Request History" information.  Appendix A of this document 
    in section 8 provides further details of these examples.  
         
 5. Security Considerations  
      
    The Request History information is being inserted by a network 
    element retargeting a Request, resulting in a slightly different 
    problem than the basic SIP header problem, thus requiring specific 
    consideration.  In addition, there may be privacy implications 
    associated with some of the Request History information.  
     
    The potential security problems introduced include the following: 
    1) A rogue application could insert a bogus Request History entry 
    either by adding an additional entry as a result of retargeting or 
    entering invalid information.  
     
    2) A rogue application could delete an entry added by a previous 
    retargeting.  While this may be a valid scenario for some 
  
  
 Watson                 Expires - December 2002              [Page 5] 
    Generic Request History Capability - Requirements           June 2002 
  
  
    applications, this may indicate a loss of integrity of the Request 
    History content, which could significantly impact other 
    applications.  
     
    3) Loss of privacy associated with forwarding a specific Request 
    URI in the Request History.  
     
    4) A rogue application could re-arrange the Request History 
    information to change the nature of the end application or to 
    mislead the receiver of the information.  
     
    Thus, any solution to "Request History" capability must meet the 
    following requirements: 
     
    1) SEC-req-1: The entity receiving the Request History must be able 
    to determine whether any of the previously added Request History 
    content has been altered.  
     
    2) SEC-req-2: The ordering of the Request History information must 
    be preserved at each instance of retargeting. 
     
    3) SEC-req-3: The entity receiving the Request History must be able 
    to determine whether a previously added Request History content has 
    been removed.  
  
    4) SEC-req-4: The entity receiving the information conveyed by the 
    Request History must be able to authenticate the source of the 
    information.   
  
    It is likely that the solutions to several of the requirements are 
    inter-related. For example, with the requirement for Chronological 
    ordering [Requirement 4.4 in section 3], it is likely that the 
    solution to SEC-req-1 would also meet SEC-req-2. Following on this, 
    if SEC-req-2 is met, then SEC-req-3 could make use of the 
    Chronological ordering to detect if information had been removed. 
     
    It should also be noted that these requirements apply to any entity 
    making use of the Request History information, either by 
    retargeting and capturing the information, or as an application 
    making use of the information in a Request or Response.  However, 
    to ensure the overall integrity of this information as it traverses 
    the network, an additional requirement with regards to the security 
    of the transport is introduced: 
      
    5) SEC-req-5: To ensure the overall integrity of the chain of 
    Request History information, the transport must be secure.  
  
    In addition, there are general privacy requirements that MUST be 
    met:

    Generic Request History Capability - Requirements           June 2002 
  
  
    6) PRIV-req-1: The entity retargeting the Request must ensure that 
    it maintains the privacy (as described in [7]) associated with the 
    original Request URI which is retargeted. 
     
    7) PRIV-req-2: The entity receiving the Request History must 
    maintain the privacy associated with the information.  
     
    It is recognized that meeting the privacy requirements may impact 
    the functionality of this solution. The applicability guidelines 
    for a solution must clearly address this impact.  
     
 6. Going forward 
     
    The authors request that the SIPPING WG study this contribution and 
    come to consensus regarding the set of requirements necessary for a 
    Generic Request History mechanism. A next step is proposed to 
    document the analysis of the various mechanisms proposed for this 
    problem domain [2][3][4] and [5] and determine the extent to which 
    these meet the agreed requirements.  Such an analysis would thus 
    provide suitable grounds for determining what extensions are 
    necessary to SIP in order to support the agreed requirements.  
     
    In addition, it is proposed that further analysis of the 
    requirements resulting in a solution would include the following: 
       
    1) Further analysis of the security requirements and potential 
      solutions.  The solution to some of the security requirements 
      appears to be in the same problem domain as the security 
      requirements for the Referredby header [10] and further analysis 
      is required to determine if this is case and whether there is 
      potential for synergy in the security solutions.   
  
    2) Further scenarios, highlighting in more detail some of the 
      issues that will be encountered due to the optionality of the 
      "Request History" capability.  This will enable the solution 
      documentation to provide more explicit guidelines on the 
      applicability of the solution.

 8.Appendix A - Scenarios 
     
    This section highlights some scenarios under which the Request 
    History Capability could be applicable.   
     
    Certainly, various other solutions can be applied in some fashion 
    to each of these scenarios, however, the objective of this draft 
    has been to abstract the requirements from these scenarios towards 
    providing a more robust solution for each and at the same time 
    providing fundamental building block(s) applicable to future 
    applications.

    8.1 Sequentially forking with Retargetting 
     
    This scenario is as follows: 
     
      o   UA 1 sends a call to proxy 1. Proxy 1 sequentially tries 
         several places (UA2, UA3 and UA4) before retargetting the call 
         to Proxy 2.  Proxy 2 unfortunately tries several of the same 
         places (UA3 and UA4), before completing at UA5.

    This scenario is provided to show the duplication of messaging when 
    there isnÆt sufficient knowledge to optimize a sequential attempt 
    at reaching an end user.  With the "Request History" capability, 
    this flow could be optimized as follows:

       This scenario is as follows:  
  
       o UA 1 called UA A which had been forwarded to UA B which 
         forwarded to a UA VM (voicemail server) which needs 
         information (e.g. reason the call was retargeted, original

         Request URI) to make a policy decision about what mailbox to 
         use, which greeting to play etc. This scenario shows that 
         something like the "Request History" capability must be used 
         for this service to function.

 Certainly, another valid scenario for the support of voicemail would 
 be that this  'policy decision' on which mailbox to use (etc.) is made 
 by the UA which forwarded to voicemail (UA B), or by the Proxy which 
 performed the forwarding on behalf of B. In this case, the UA or Proxy 
 can put all the information that the Voicemail server needs to 
 identity the correct mailbox, etc., into the Request-URI. This fits 
 with the SIP service paradigm where the Request-URI identifies the 
 resource (namely, the particular mailbox/greeting etc.) that is 
 required. 
  
 However, whilst this model is certainly applicable and required in 
 SIP, it places service intelligence away from the system providing the 
 key aspect of the service (the VM server).  
  
 The proposal in this draft  is to rely on  generic information-
 providing capabilities in the UA/Proxy, allowing the Voicemail system 
 to provide more and better voicemail-related services without relying

 on specific capabilities in the UA/Proxy. This would allow voicemail 
 service providers to innovate independently of the particular UA/Proxy 
 that their customers are using, and its capabilities. Presently, with 
 the information loss problem, VM service providers, and any other 
 similar service providers, are limited in the services they can 
 provide because they do not have complete information about how the 
 call reached them. They rely on the UA/proxy of their customers having 
 the necessary capabilities to formulate a Request-URI identifying 
 exactly what should happen next. Finally, there is obviously a desire 
 to use existing voicemail platforms based on PSTN/ISDN technology 
 which operate according to the paradigm in this example.
