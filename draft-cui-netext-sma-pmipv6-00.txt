Internet-Draft  SMA for PMIPv6 based on Single HNP Model    October 2009


Abstract

   Simultaneous Multi-Access (SMA), originally designed for MIPv6,
   expects to be ported to PMIPv6 to achieve flow binding. However,
   there are a lot of problems to adapt SMA to PMIPv6 due to
   different mechanisms of two mobility management protocol. This
   document analyzes issues of SMA and different multihoming
   scenarios in PMIPv6. A PMIPv6 system which allows a MN to share
   HNP across its interfaces is proposed and a SMA solution is
   designed for the modified PMIPv6 system. The solution supports
   flow-based routing and address-based routing simultaneously.

Internet-Draft  SMA for PMIPv6 based on Single HNP Model    October 2009


1. Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [1] allows a multihoming mobile node to
   connect to a PMIPv6 domain via multiple interfaces simultaneously.
   With several paths available, flows could be bind to different
   path to achieve load-balance, high aggregated bandwidth and flow
   mobility. Simultaneous Multi-Access (SMA) [2], which is proposed
   to takes these advantages of multihoming in MIPv6, could be
   adapted to PMIPv6 to enable flow bindings. However, because of the
   fact that MN uses different Home Network Prefixes (HNPs) on
   different interfaces rather than a unique Home Address of MN in
   MIPv6, additional mechanism such as Primary Prefix is introduced
   into PMIPv6 to ensure packets can be routed to MN via a proper
   path [3].

   As for the PMIPv6 specification, assigning different HNPs for
   different interfaces of one MN is regarded as lack of simultaneous
   usage support and therefore is difficult to provide flow binding
   support [4]. Besides this proposal, sharing the same HNPs across
   multiple interfaces of one MN in PMIPv6 is proposed as a solution
   for multihoming (different MNs are still assigned different HNPs).
   This model is able to provide convenience for some multihoming
   application, including flow-based routing [5].

   This document describes a SMA solution for PMIPv6 based on Single
   HNP Model. In the rest of the document, the issues of SMA support
   in PMIPv6 and the advantages of sharing HNPs across interfaces are
   analyzed. Based on the modified PMIPv6 system, a SMA solution is
   proposed to support both address-based routing and flow-based
   routing.

3. Overview

3.1. Issues of SMA Support in PMIPv6

   SMA, originally designed for MIPv6, aims to take advantages of
   multihoming. Its primary idea is to use policies to bind flow to a
   specified path based on different characteristics of multiple
   available paths (such as bandwidth, QoS, cost, etc.). In another
   word, MIPv6 system equipped with SMA function performs flow-based
   routing; both inbound packets and outbound packets are directed to
   a specified interface by either HA or MN according to policies.

   In MIPv6, each MN has a unique Home Address (HoA) which is always
   used as the source address of outbound packet and the destination

   address of inbound packet. Without regard to route optimization,
   tunnels from HA to MN ensures that packets can be routed to either
   MN or CN properly no matter which interface MN uses to transmit
   packets. Therefore, there is little difficulty in performing SMA
   in MIPv6.

   However, the situation is quite different in PMIPv6.  First of
   all, unlike the unique HoA in MIPv6, MN is assigned different HNPs
   for each interface in PMIPv6 and consequently addresses of
   interfaces are different from each other. When communicating with
   CN, MN use the address on the outgoing physical interface so it
   could lead to troubles to bind an existing flow, which is usually
   identified by the source and destination addresses, to another
   interface. Flow-based routing might cause conflict with address-
   based routing for the address of bound interface might not match
   with the address of the flow.

   Second, additional mechanism is necessary to guarantee the
   validity of routing. Tunnels are built from LMA to MAGs rather
   than MN in PMIPv6. Therefore, even if LMA is able to perform flow-
   based routing to select a proper MAG to forward packets to,
   additional mechanisms are necessary to introduced to MAGs to
   ensure they are able to relay packets to MN. Take the scenario in
   Figure 1 as an example. MAG2 should have the information about
   HNP1 so as to forward Flow1 to MN via IF2. Otherwise, MAG2 cannot
   find a route match the destination of the packet; even if MAG2 is
   able to perform flow-based routing, it has to recognize which MN
   the flow belongs to by matching the destination address of the
   flow.

   Third, MN has to be extended to support SMA in PMIPv6. PMIPv6 is
   designed as a network-based mobility management protocol so that
   MN needs no extension to get mobility support in a PMIPv6 domain.
   However, to enable SMA function, MN has to be modified to support
   the generation and transmission of routing rules as well as flow
   binding operation. Moreover, owing to the above-mentioned two
   issues, existing proposal involves MN in mobility management to
   request Primary Prefix and to update Binding ID [3].

   In short, flow-based routing of SMA relies on address-based
   routing because only address information of a packet can be used
   to identify the corresponding MN. With regard to PMIPv6, since
   there is no direct tunnel from LMA to MN, HNP allocation and
   conventional address-based routing of PMIPv6 should coordinate
   with SMA mechanism to achieve flow binding. Moreover, extension to
   MN is also necessary to make full use of multihoming.

3.2. Multihoming Scenarios of PMIPv6

   Different scenarios of multihoming in PMIPv6 can be divided into
   two categories according to their HNP model. One is multiple HNP
   model that assign unique HNP to each interface; the other is
   single HNP model that assign the same HNP across interfaces of one
   MN.

3.2.1. Multiple HNP Model

   PMIPv6, defined in [1], use this model to assign HNP for MN. In
   this model, each interface is assigned a unique HNP so a
   multihoming MN always gets multiple HNPs; each binding tied to an
   interface of MN is considered as a separate mobility session;
   multiple interfaces are able to connect to PMIPv6 domain
   simultaneously and transmit data independently. However, some
   advanced multihoming application meets troubles in this model,
   including HNP allocation in vertical handoff, lack of simultaneous
   usage support [4], aforementioned SMA issues, etc.

Internet-Draft  SMA for PMIPv6 based on Single HNP Model    October 2009


3.2.2. Single HNP Model

   In this model, a HNP is shared across different interfaces one MN.
   There are several forms for this model. One is to assign unique
   HNP to a MN and configure address for every interface of MN;
   another one is to allow some HNPs to be shared across different
   interfaces belonging to a MN; a third one is to configure the same
   address on every interface of a MN to emulate HoA of MIPv6.

   Despite varieties of this model, the primary feature of it is that
   the address of an interface has prefix in common with others and
   thus different MAGs are able to add general routing table entry
   for different interface addresses of one MN.

   However, this model causes problems for routing of LMA and MAG. As
   for conventional PMIPv6, prefix-based routing of LMA and MAG works
   well to forward packet for multihoming MN because prefixes of
   multiple interfaces are different from each other but this no
   longer work in Single HNP Model for prefix matching comes to
   ambiguous result. On the other hand, address-based routing is an
   alternative to prefix-based routing but it leads to troubles that
   are similar to problems of Multiple HNP Model. Yet, with the
   combination of prefix-based routing and address-based routing,
   Single HNP Model is able to provide a valid platform for SMA
   support, which will be described in the following sections.

4. PMIPv6 based on Single HNP Model

   This section describes a modified PMIPv6 system based on Single
   HNP Model. The PMIPv6 system SHOULD support multihoming and be
   able to forward a packet to a proper interface of MN based on the
   destination address. Moreover, it SHOULD support SMA function with
   the aid of routing rules management and flow-based routing
   extension.

4.1. HNP Allocation and Address Configuration

   The system is based on Single HNP Model so the same HNP is
   assigned to different interfaces of one MN. Yet, different HNPs
   MAY be assigned to different interfaces as that of conventional
   PMIPv6. However, for interfaces that are preparing for SMA usage,
   shared HNP SHOULD be assigned to them.

   Receiving HNP, MN SHOULD configure different addresses for
   different interfaces even if they share the same HNP. Although
   configuring the same address on different address emulates the HoA
   of MIPv6 to some degree, duplicated IPv6 global addresses on
   different physical interfaces might result in troubles such as
   address collision and some systems does not allow such operation.
   However, using the same prefix to configure different addresses is
   well supported so this approach is feasible.

4.2. Routing of LMA and MAG

   LMA SHOULD add address-based routing table entries for each access
   interface that connects to the PMIPv6 domain. MAG SHOULD add both
   address-based and prefix-based routing table entries for each
   access interface that connects to the MAG itself.

   Address-based routing table entries of LMA and MAG ensure that
   packets can be routed to the interface with the destination
   address. The longest prefix matching of address-based routing make
   address-based entries selected to get the outgoing interface and
   next hop for each packet. On the other hand, prefix-based entries
   of MAG are used for simultaneous usage support and will come into
   handy in SMA function.

   To set up address-based entries, LMA and MAG SHOULD be aware of
   the addresses of access interface, which is different from
   original PMIPv6 for the prefix is enough to identify a routing
   path in Multiple HNP Model. This can be achieved by using Neighbor
   Discovery of IPv6. Since MN will send Neighbor Advertisement after
   configuring address on an interface, MAG can get the address of
   the access interface by receiving such messages. After that, MAG
   SHOULD inform LMA of the address. Thus, additional signaling is
   required to support address-based routing in Single HNP Model.
   Figure 2 shows the extended signaling call flow of MN attachment,
   in which extra PBU and PBA are added to transmit the address of
   access interface.

5.1. Registration of Routing Rules

   A Routing Rule is a rule which specifies that traffic with certain
   characteristic is to be handled in a certain manner. Its main
   application is to bind a flow to a certain path. A Path Identifier

   (PID) is used to identify a path between a multihoming MN and its
   peers [2]. For MIPv6, the PID is identical to the Binding
   Identifier (BID) [6]. In PMIPv6, there is no BID for bindings but
   a Link-layer Identifier (LL-ID) is generated for each access
   interface and it can be used to identify a path.

   Routing Rules can be generated by either MN or LMA and should be
   transmitted to the other side by generator. The transmission of
   Routing Rules can be achieved by extended ICMP messages and
   mobility signaling defined in [3]. At LMA, Routing Rules are
   stored in the Binding Cache Entry for the LL-ID.

5.2. Data Transmission

   This section will explain how traffic is sent from and to a MN
   based on SMA function. Figure 3 shows a PMIPv6 multihoming
   scenario with the following assumptions:

   o  MN has two active interfaces; IF1 connects to MAG1 and IF2
      connects to MAG2.

   o  IF1 and IF2 share the same HNP but they have respective
      addresses (ADDR1 and ADDR2).

   o  Both MAG1 and MAG2 have set up address-based and prefix-based
      routing table entries for corresponding access interface.

   o  LMA has set up address-based routing table entries for IF1 and
      IF2.

   o  A set of Routing Rules with associated LL-IDs have been created
      and transmitted. They are stored in both MN and LMA.

      List of Routing Rules:

      Flow A <--> LL-ID1

      Flow B <--> LL-ID2

   o  MN is communicating with a CN.

5.2.1. Sending Packet from MN

   When MN sends a packet to CN, it will match the packet with
   Routing Rules. If the packet matches one of the Routing Rules, the
   outgoing interface is selected according to the LL-ID in the
   Routing Rule. Otherwise, MN just looks up into routing table to
   get the outgoing interface by address-based routing. With the
   outgoing interface, MN transmits the packet on that interface. The
   MAG receiving the packet tunnels the packet to LMA. LMA
   decapsulates the packet and routes it towards CN.

5.2.2. Sending Packet to MN

   When LMA receives a packet from CN, it will search the Binding
   Cache for entries with HNP matches the destination address of the
   packet. Then it will check whether the packet matches one of the
   Routing Rules belong to those Binding Cache entries.

   If the packet matches one of the Routing Rules, the tunnel
   interface identifier of the corresponding binding cache is
   selected and LMA will use that tunnel to forward packet towards
   MAG. When MAG receive the packet, it decapsulates the packet and
   performs address-based routing to forward the packet to MN. If the
   address of access interface connecting to the MAG is not the same
   as the destination address of the packet, MAG can still route it
   based on the prefix-based routing table entry for ADDR1 and ADDR2
   share the same prefix; if the two addresses are the same, MAG will
   route it based on the address-based entry: issues mentioned in
   Section 3.1 no longer troubles.

   Otherwise, if none of the Routing Rules is matched, LMA and MAG
   will just perform address-based routing. The address-based routing
   table entries set up in the registration procedure are enough to
   help to route the packet to MN.

   However, a problem arises when MN receives the packet. Although
   network side manages to route the packet to one of the interfaces
   of MN, MN has to be able to receive a packet aiming at one
   interface from another interface. Otherwise, when the destination
   address of the packet does not match the address of receiving
   interface, the packet would be discarded. Yet, weak End System
   Model, defined in [7] and supported by most of current systems,
   allows MN to do so. Therefore, MN is able to receive the packet as
   long as network side forwards the packet properly.

5.3. Vertical Handoff

   In SMA, moving flows across running interfaces could be achieved
   by changing routing rules but it cannot handle the condition where
   an interface disconnect from the network. For example, MN in
   Figure 3 starts a flow on IF1 with ADDR1. If IF1 disconnect from
   the network, the address configured on it is also gone. Thus, MN
   cannot receive the existing flow any longer even if network side
   route the flow to IF2. To solve the problem, additional mechanism
   is need to perform vertical handoff, i.e. the handoff between
   different interfaces.

   Both network side and MN are involved in vertical handoff. First,
   network side SHOULD be aware of the handoff event so as to launch
   a new proxy registration and modify routing entries. Second, MN
   SHOULD be able to configure ADDR1 on IF2 to receive the existing
   flow.

   As for the network side, although Handoff Indicator Option is
   defined in PMIPv6 [1] to implement such a handoff, no mechanism is
   designed for MAG to detect handoff event so it cannot set the
   value of the option properly. This document suggests that MN
   notify MAG of handoff event since only MN itself is aware of
   whether it would like to perform a handoff to move existing flow

   to IF2 or it just want to terminate IF1 as well as the flow on it.
   The notification could be done by sending an extended RS, just
   like that defined in [8], via IF2. After receiving the request,
   MAG2 will perform a new registration for ADDR1. Since IF1 and IF2
   shares the same HNP, MAG and HNP just need to change their
   address-based routing entries as well as update binding cache and
   binding update list. When MN receives RA, it SHOULD be configure
   ADDR1 on IF2 so address configuration mechanism of MN need to be
   modified to meet such requirement. How to extend MN to support
   extended RS and the modified address configuration mechanism is
   out of scope of this document. Figure 4 shows the signaling call
   flow of vertical handoff. Notice that since LMA has already got
   ADDR1 and it could inform MAG2 of ADDR1 in PBA, it is not
   necessary for MAG2 to get the address by listening for Neighbor
   Advertisement.

6. Conclusion

   This document describes a SMA solution for PMIPv6 based on Single
   HNP Model. The protocol performs flow-based routing based on
   Routing Rules to bind both inbound and outbound flow to a
   specified path while it performs address-based routing for packets
   that do not match any Routing Rules. Extra mobility signaling call
   is added to set up address-based routing. Both LMA and MAG are
   extended to be able to generate Routing Rules, transmit them and
   route packets according to them; however, the extension on MN is
   limited to SMA function and mobility management is still done by
   network side, which follows the idea of PMIPv6.
