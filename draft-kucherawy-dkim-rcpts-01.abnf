rh=  Recipient hash (base64; OPTIONAL).

     ABNF:

sig-rh-tag = %x72.68 [FWS] "=" [FWS] base64string
      The output of the SHA hash of the envelope recipient, as described
      in Section 4.

rs=  Recipient salt (plain-text; OPTIONAL).

     ABNF:

salt-chars = ( ALPHA / DIGIT )
sig-rs-tag = %x72.73 [FWS] "=" [FWS] 1*8salt-chars

      If present, this provides a salt that is prepended to the envelope
      recipient before hashing.  Ignored if the "rh" tag is not also
      present.
