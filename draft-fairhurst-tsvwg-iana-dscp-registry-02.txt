Internet-Draft                                    University of Aberdeen
Updates: RFC2474 (if approved)                         December 24, 2017
Intended status: Standards Track
Expires: June 25, 2018

IANA Assignment of DSCP Pool 3 (xxxx01) Values to require Publication of
             a Standards Track or Best Current Practice RFC
              draft-fairhurst-tsvwg-iana-dscp-registry-02

Abstract

   The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use of
   the DSField in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet header to carry the Diffserv
   Codepoint (DSCP). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   maintains a registry of assigned DSCP values.

   This update to RFC2474 changes the IANA assignment method for Pool 3
   of the registry (i.e., DSCPs of the form xxxx01) to Standards Action,
   i.e., values are assigned through a Standards Track or Best Current
   Practice RFC. The update also removes permission for experimental and
   Local Use of the codepoints that form Pool 3 of the DSCP registry;
   Pool 1 codepoints (i.e., DSCPs of the form xxxx11) remain available
   for these purposes.

1.  Introduction

   The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) [RFC2475] architecture
   (updated by [RFC3260]) provides scalable service differentiation in
   the Internet.  Diffserv uses the six most significant bits of the
   former IPv4 Type of Service (TOS) octet or the former IPV6 Traffic
   Class octet to convey the DSField, which is used to carry the
   Diffserv Codepoint (DSCP). This DSCP value is used to select a
   Diffserv Per hop Behaviour, PHB.

   The six bit DSField is capable of conveying 64 distinct codepoints,
   and this codepoint space has been divided into three pools for the
   purpose of codepoint assignment and management (as shown in figure
   1).  Pool 1 comprises 32 codepoints [RFC2474].  These are assigned by
   Standards Action, as defined in [RFC8126].  Pool 2 comprises a pool
   of 16 codepoints reserved for experimental or Local Use (EXP/LU) as
   defined in [RFC2474], and Pool 3 comprises 16 codepoints [RFC2474],
   which were initially "available for experimental or local use, but
   which were indicated should be preferentially utilized for
   standardized assignments if Pool 1 is ever exhausted."

Internet-Draft    IANA Diffserv assignment for Pool 3      December 2017


   +------+-----------------+
   | Pool | Codepoint Space |
   +------+-----------------+
   |  1   |     xxxxx0      |
   +------+-----------------+
   |  2   |     xxxx11      |
   +------+-----------------+
   |  3   |     xxxx01      |

   Figure 1: Format of the DSField for Codepoints allocated in the
   three IANA pools (where 'x' refers to either '0' or '1').
   

   At the time of writing this document, 23 of the 32 Pool 1 codepoints
   have currently been assigned.

   Although Pool 1 has not yet been completely exhausted, this document
   changes the IANA registration policy of Pool 3 to assignment by
   Standards Action, i.e., values are assigned by Standards Track or
   Best Current Practice RFCs.  The rationale for this update is a need
   to assign codepoints for particular PHBs that are unable to use any
   of the unassigned values in Pool 1.

   An example is the need to assign a suitable recommended default
   codepoint for the Lower Effort (LE) per-hop behavior (PHB) [I-D.ietf-
   tsvwg-le-phb].  The LE PHB is designed to protect best-effort (BE)
   traffic (packets forwarded with the default PHB) from LE traffic in
   congestion situations, i.e., when resources become scarce, best-
   effort traffic has precedence over LE traffic and may preempt it.
   The continued presence of bleaching of the IP precedence field
   (setting the top three bits of the former ToS byte to zero) in
   deployed networks motivates the desire for the LE PHB to use a DSCP
   with a zero value for the first three bits [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-le-phb].
   At the same time, it is also important to reduce the likelihood of
   priority inversion caused by unintentional re-mapping of other
   (higher assurance) traffic to the DSCP used for this PHB. The absence
   of unassigned codepoints in Pool 1 that exhibit these important
   properties motivates assigning a Pool 3 codepoint as the default that
   is recommended for use with this PHB.

   To allow the IETF to utilise Pool 3 codepoints, this document
   requests IANA to manage Pool 3 and make assignments for DSCP
   codepoints in Pool 3 when requested by Standards Action.  This
   assignment method requires publication of a Standards Track or Best
   Current Practice RFC.

2.  Terminology

   This document assumes familiarity with the terminology used in
   [RFC2475] updated by [RFC3260].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  The update to RFC2474

   This document updates section 6 of [RFC2474], in the following ways.

   It updates the following text concerning the assignment method:

   OLD: which are initially available for experimental or local use, but
      which should be preferentially utilized for standardized
      assignments if Pool 1 is ever exhausted.

   NEW: which are utilized for standardized assignments (replacing the
      previous availability for experimental or local use)".

   It removes the footnote in RFC2474 relating to Pool 3:

   DELETE: "(*) may be utilized for future Standards Action allocations
      as necessary"

   The new registry contents are shown in Figure 2.

                 Pool        Codepoint space          Assignment Policy
                 ----        ---------------          -----------------
   
                 1            xxxxx0                 Standards Action
                 2            xxxx11                 EXP/LU
                 3            xxxx01                 Standards Action

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the use of DSCPs are described in the
   RFCs that define their usage.  This document does not present new
   security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section requests IANA to change the use of Pool 3 in the DSCP
   registry and to manage this Pool using a Standards Action assignment
   method.

   This requests IANA to make the following changes to the
   Differentiated Services Field Codepoints (DSCP) Registry, made
   available at [Registry].

   The previous registry text:

Internet-Draft    IANA Diffserv assignment for Pool 3      December 2017


      3 xxxx01 Experimental or Local Use May be utilized for future
      Standards Action allocations as necessary.

   is replaced with the following registry text:

      3 xxxx01 Standards Action.

   To manage codepoints in Pool 3, IANA is requested to create and
   maintain a "Pool 3 Codepoints" entry.  Pool 3 of the registry is to
   be created initially empty, with a format identical to that used for
   "Pool 1 Codepoints".

   The Registration Procedure for use of Pool 3 is "Standards Action"
   [RFC8126].  IANA is expected to normally make assignments from Pool
   1, until this Pool is exhausted, but MAY make assignments from Pool 3
   where the format of the codepoint has properties that are needed for
   a specific PHB. The required characteristics for choosing the DSCP
   value MUST be explained in the IANA considerations of the document
   that requests any assignment from Pool 3

   IANA is requested to reference RFC3260 and this current document.
