Abstract

   Practice has shown that there are a number of DNS zones all iterative
   resolvers and recursive nameservers should, unless configured
   otherwise, automatically serve.  RFC 4193 already specifies that this
   should occur for D.F.IP6.ARPA.  This document extends the practice to
   cover the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for RFC 1918 address space and other
   well known zones with similar usage constraints.

Internet-Draft          Locally-served DNS Zones              March 2007


1.  Introduction

   Practice has shown that there are a number of DNS [RFC 1034] [RFC
   1035] zones all iterative resolvers and recursive nameservers should,
   unless configured otherwise, automatically serve.  These zones
   include, but are not limited to, the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for the
   address space allocated by [RFC 1918] and the IP6.ARPA zones for
   locally assigned local IPv6 addresses, [RFC 4193].

   This recommendation is made because data has shown that significant
   leakage of queries for these name spaces is occurring, despite
   instructions to restrict them, and because sacrificial name servers
   have been deployed to protect the immediate parent name servers for
   these zones from excessive, unintentional, query load [AS112].  There
   is every expectation that the query load will continue to increase
   unless steps are taken as outlined here.

   Additionally, queries from clients behind badly configured firewalls
   that allow outgoing queries but drop responses for these name spaces
   also puts a significant load on the root servers.  They also cause
   operational load for the root server operators as they have to reply
   to queries about why the root servers are "attacking" these clients.
   Changing the default configuration will address all these issues for
   the zones listed below in Section 4.

   [RFC 4193] already recommends that queries for D.F.IP6.ARPA be
   handled locally.  This document extends the recommendation to cover
   the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for [RFC 1918] and other well known IN-
   ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA zones for which queries should not appear on
   the public Internet.

   It is hoped that by doing this the number of sacrificial servers
   [AS112] will not have to be increased and may in time be reduced.

   It should also help DNS responsiveness for sites which are using [RFC
   1918] addresses but do not follow the last paragraph in section 3 of
   [RFC 1918].

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].


2.  Effects on sites using RFC 1918 addresses.

   For most sites using [RFC 1918] addresses, the changes here will have



Andrews                 Expires September 3, 2007               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          Locally-served DNS Zones              March 2007


   little or no detrimental effect.  If the site does not already have
   the reverse tree populated the only effect will be that the answers
   are generated locally rather than remotely.

   For sites that do have the reverse tree populated, most will either
   have a local copy of the zones or will be forwarding the queries to
   servers which have local copies of the zone.  In either case the
   local resolver has a pre-existing configuration for the namespace and
   won't add the automatic zone.

   The main impact will be felt at sites that make use of delegation for
   reverse lookups for [RFC 1918] addresses and have populated these
   zones.  Typically, such sites will be fully disconnected from the
   Internet and have their own root servers for their own non-Internet
   DNS tree.  These sites will need to override the default
   configuration expressed in this document to allow resolution to
   continue.


3.  Changes to Iterative Resolver Behaviour.

   Unless configured otherwise, an iterative resolver will now return
   name errors (RCODE=3) for queries within the lists of zones covered
   below, with the obvious exception of queries for the zone name itself
   where SOA, NS and "no data" responses will be returned as appropriate
   to the query type.  One common way to do this is to serve empty (SOA
   and NS only) zones.

   A implementation doing this MUST provide a mechanism to disable this
   new behaviour, preferably on a zone by zone basis.

   If using empty zones one SHOULD NOT use the same NS and SOA records
   as used on the public Internet servers as that will make it harder to
   detect leakage to the public Internet servers.  This document
   recommends that the NS record defaults to the name of the zone and
   the SOA MNAME defaults to the name of the only NS RR's target.  The
   SOA RNAME should default to ".".  Implementations SHOULD provide a
   mechanism to set these values.  No address records need to be
   provided for the name server.

   Below is a example of a generic empty zone in master file format.  It
   will produce a negative cache ttl of 3 hours.

   @ 10800 IN SOA @ . 1 3600 1200 604800 10800
   @ 10800 IN NS @

   The SOA RR is needed to support negative caching [RFC 2308] of name
   error responses and to point clients to the primary master for DNS



Andrews                 Expires September 3, 2007               [Page 4]

   dynamic updates.

   SOA values of particular importance are the MNAME, the SOA RR's TTL
   and the negTTL value.  Both TTL values SHOULD match.  The rest of the
   SOA timer values may be chosen arbitrarily since it they are not
   intended to control any zone transfer activity.

   The NS RR is needed as some UPDATE clients use NS queries to discover
   they zone to be updated.  Having no address records for the name
   server should abort UPDATE processing in the client

4.3.  Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses

   See [RFC 4291], sections 2.4, 2.5.2 and 2.5.3.

      0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.IP
      6.ARPA
      1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.IP
      6.ARPA

4.4.  IPv6 Locally Assigned Local Addresses

   See [RFC 4193].

      D.F.IP6.ARPA

4.5.  IPv6 Link Local Addresses

   See [RFC 4291], sections 2.4 and 2.5.6.

      8.E.F.IP6.ARPA
      9.E.F.IP6.ARPA
      A.E.F.IP6.ARPA
      B.E.F.IP6.ARPA


5.  Zones that are Out-Of-Scope

   IPv6 site-local addresses, [RFC 4291] sections 2.4 and 2.57, and IPv6
   Globally Assigned Local [RFC 4193] addresses are not covered here.
   It is expected that IPv6 site-local addresses will be self correcting
   as IPv6 implementations remove support for site-local addresses.
   However, sacrificial servers for C.E.F.IP6.ARPA to F.E.F.IP6.ARPA may
   still need to be deployed in the short term if the traffic becomes
   excessive.

   For IPv6 Globally Assigned Local addresses [RFC 4291] there has been
   no decision made about whether the registries will provide
   delegations in this space or not.  If they don't, then C.F.IP6.ARPA
   will need to be added to the list above.  If they do, then registries
   will need to take steps to ensure that name servers are provided for
   these addresses.

   This document is also ignoring IP6.INT.  IP6.INT has been wound up
   with only legacy resolvers now generating reverse queries under
   IP6.INT.

   This document has also deliberately ignored names immediately under
   the root.  While there is a subset of queries to the roots which



Andrews                 Expires September 3, 2007               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          Locally-served DNS Zones              March 2007


   could be addressed using the techniques described here (e.g. .local
   and IPv4 addresses) there is also a vast amount of traffic that
   requires a different strategy (e.g. lookups for unqualied hostnames,
   IPv6 addresses).


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document recommends that IANA establish a registry of zones
   which require this default behaviour, the initial contents of which
   are in Section 4.  More zones are expected to be added, and possibly
   deleted from this registry over time.  Name server implementors are
   encouraged to check this registry and adjust their implementations to
   reflect changes therein.

   This registry can be amended through "IETF Consensus" as per [RFC
   2434] or IETF Review in 2434bis.

   IANA should co-ordinate with the RIRs and ICANN to ensure the DNSSEC
   deployment in the reverse trees that these zone are delegated in a
   unsecure manner as per Security Considerations.


7.  Security Considerations

   During the initial deployment phase, particularly where [RFC 1918]
   addresses are in use, there may be some clients that unexpectedly
   receive a name error rather than a PTR record.  This may cause some
   service disruption until full service resolvers have been re-
   configured.

   When DNSSEC is deployed within the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA
   namespaces, the zones listed above will need to be delegated as
   insecure delegations.  This will allow DNSSEC validation to succeed
   for queries in these spaces despite not being answered from the
   delegated servers.

   It is recommended that sites actively using these namespaces secure
   them using DNSSEC [RFC 4035] by publishing and using DNSSEC trust
   anchors.  This will protect the clients from accidental leakage of
   unsigned answers from the Internet.
