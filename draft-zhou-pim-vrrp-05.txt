                       draft-zhou-pim-vrrp-05.txt

Abstract

   This document introduces VRRP Aware PIM, a redundancy mechanism for
   the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) to interoperate with Virtual
   Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).  It allows PIM to track VRRP state
   and to preserve multicast traffic upon failover in a redundant
   network with virtual routing groups enabled.  The mechanism described
   in this document is based on Cisco IOS software implementation.

1.  Introduction

   Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC5798] is a redundancy
   protocol for establishing a fault-tolerant default gateway.  The
   protocol establishes a framework between network devices in order to
   achieve default gateway failover if the primary gateway becomes
   inaccessible.

   PIM [RFC4601] has no inherent redundancy capabilities and its
   operation is completely independent of VRRP group states.  As a
   result, IP multicast traffic is forwarded not necessarily by the same
   device as is elected by VRRP.  The VRRP Aware PIM feature provides
   consistent IP multicast forwarding in a redundant network with
   virtual routing groups enabled.

   In a multi-access segment (such as LAN), PIM designated router (DR)
   election is unaware of the redundancy configuration, and the elected
   DR and VRRP master router (MR) may not be the same router.  In order
   to ensure that the PIM DR is always able to forward PIM Join/Prune
   (J/P) message towards RP or FHR, the VRRP MR becomes the PIM DR (if
   there is only one VRRP group).  PIM is responsible for adjusting DR
   priority based on the group state.  When a failover occurs, multicast
   states are created on the new MR elected by the VRRP group and the MR
   assumes responsibility for the routing and forwarding of all the
   traffic addressed to the VRRP virtual IP address.  This ensures the
   PIM DR runs on the same gateway as the VRRP MR and maintains mroute
   states.  It enables multicast traffic to be forwarded through the
   VRRP MR, allowing PIM to leverage VRRP redundancy, avoid potential
   duplicate traffic, and enable failover, depending on the VRRP states
   in the device.

   All routers forming a VRRP group on a common link must support this
   mechanism in order to achieve correct behavior.  Other routers that
   do not support the mechanism on the link will not break the
   functionality of this mechanism, as long as their DR priority
   configurations do not conflict with the routers in the VRRP group.
   This mechanism has been implemented on Cisco IOS software.

2.  Tracking and Failover

   Without the mechanisms described in this document, a PIM component
   will send PIM J/P with DR's IP address to upstream routers.  A GenId
   in PIM Hello message is randomly selected when the router boots and
   remains the same as long as the router is up.  A PIM neighbor reboot
   can easily be detected if its GenId is different from before, in this
   case PIM J/P and RP-Set information can be redistributed to the new
   rebooted neighbor.  With VRRP aware PIM mechanism enabled, PIM
   component listens to the state change notifications from VRRP and
   automatically adjusts the priority of the PIM DR based on the VRRP
   state, and ensures VRRP MR (if there is only one VRRP group) becomes
   the DR of the LAN.  If there are multiple VRRP groups, the DR is
   determined by user-configured priority value.

   Upon failover, PIM triggers communication between upstream and
   downstream devices in order to create mroute states on the new MR.  A
   PIM component sends an additional PIM Hello message using the VRRP
   virtual IP addresses as the source address for each active VRRP group
   when a device becomes VRRP Master.  The PIM Hello message with new
   GenID will trigger other routers to respond to the VRRP failover just
   the same way as to neighbor reboot.  When a downstream device
   receives this PIM Hello, it will add the virtual address to its PIM
   neighbor list, and immediately send triggered PIM J/P messages
   towards the virtual IP address.  Upstream routers will process PIM J/
   P based on VRRP group state.  If the PIM J/P destination address
   matches the VRRP group virtual address and if the destination device
   is in VRRP master state, the current VRRP MR processes the PIM J/P
   message.  This allows all PIM J/P to reach the VRRP group virtual
   address and minimizes changes and configurations at the downstream
   routers side.

   Alternatively, implementation can choose to have all passive routers
   maintain mroute states and record the GenID of current MR.  When a
   passive router becomes MR upon failover, it uses the existing mroute
   states and the recorded MR GenID in its Hello message.  This will
   avoid resending PIM J/P messages upon failover and eliminates the
   requirement of additional PIM Hello with virtual IP address.  There
   is no change in on-wire behavior or in the PIM/VRRP message format.

3.  PIM Assert Metric Auto-Adjustment

   It is possible that, after VRRP Master switched from A to B; A is
   still forwarding multicast traffic which will result in duplicate
   traffic and PIM Assert mechanism will kick in.  PIM Assert with
   redundancy is enabled.

   o  If only one VRRP group, passive routers will send a large penalty
      metric preference (PIM_ASSERT_INFINITY - 1) and make MR the Assert
      winner.

   o  If there are multiples VRRP groups configured on an interface,
      Assert metric preference will be (PIM_ASSERT_INFINITY - 1) if and
      only if all VRRP groups are in passive state.

   o  If there is at least one VRRP group is in Active, then original
      Assert metric preference will be used.  That is, winner will be
      selected between routers using their real Assert metric preference
      with at least one active VRRP Group, just like no VRRP is
      involved.

4.  DF Election for BiDir Group

   Change to DF offer/winner metric is handled similarly to PIM Assert
   handling with VRRP.

   o  If only one VRRP group, passive routers will send a large penalty
      metric preference in Offer (PIM_BIDIR_INFINITY_PREF- 1) and make
      MR the DF winner.

   o  If there are multiples VRRP groups configured on an interface,
      Offer metric preference will be (PIM_BIDIR_INFINITY_PREF- 1) if
      and only if all VRRP groups are in passive.

   o  If there is at least one VRRP group is in Active, then original
      Offer metric preference to RP will be used.  That is, winner will
      be selected between routers using their real Offer metric with at
      least one active VRRP Group, just like no VRRP is involved.

5.  Tracking Multiple VRRP Groups on an Interface

   User can configure PIM to track more than one VRRP groups on an
   interface.  This allows other applications to exploit the PIM/VRRP
   interoperability to achieve various goals (e.g., load balancing).
   Since each VRRP groups configured on an interface could be in
   different states at any moment, the DR priority is adjusted.  PIM
   Assert metric and PIM Bidir DF metric if and only if all VRRP groups
   configured on an interface are in passive (non-Active) states to

   ensure that interfaces with all-passive VRRP groups will not win in
   DR, Assert and DF election.  In other words, DR, Assert, DF winner
   will be elected among the interfaces with at least one Active VRRP
   group.

6.  Support of HSRP

   Although there are differences between VRRP and Hot Standby Router
   Protocol (HSRP) [RFC2281] including number of backup (standby)
   routers, virtual IP address and timer intervals, the proposed scheme
   can also enable HSRP aware PIM with similar failover and tracking
   mechanism described in this draft.

7.  Security Considerations

   The proposed tracking mechanism does not discuss adding
   authentication to the protocols and introduces no new negative impact
   or threats on security to PIM in either SSM or ASM mode.  Note that
   VRRP messages from malicious nodes could cause unexpected behaviors
   such as multiple Masters and PIM DRs which are associated with VRRP
   specific security issues.  Detailed analysis of PIM and VRRP security
   is provided in [RFC5294] and [RFC5798].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
