<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>

The Security Considerations sections of many Internet Drafts say,
in effect, "just use IPsec".  While this is sometimes correct,
more often it will leave users without real, interoperable security
mechanisms.  This memo offers some guidance on when IPsec Version 2
should and
should not be specified.

</p>
<a name="anchor1"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>
    The Security Considerations sections of many Internet Drafts say, in
    effect, "just use IPsec".  While the use of IPsec is sometimes the
    correct security solution, more information is needed to provide
    interoperable security solutions.  In some cases, IPsec is
    unavailable in the likely endpoints.  If IPsec is unavailable
    to -- and hence unusable by -- a majority of the user in a particular
    protocol environment, then the specification of IPsec is tantamount
    to saying "turn off security" within this community.  Further, when
    IPsec is available, the implementation may not provide the proper
    granularity of protection.  Finally, if IPsec is available and
    appropriate, the document mandating the use of IPsec needs to specify
    just how it is to be used.

</p>
<p>
    The goal of this document is to provide guidance to protocol
    designers on the specification of IPsec when it is the appropriate
    security mechanism.  The protocol specification is expected to
    provide realistic, interoperable security.  Therefore guidance on
    the configuration of the various IPsec databases, such as the
    Security Policy Database (SPD), is often required.

</p>

publication time.

</p>
<a name="anchor2"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
WARNING</h3>

<p>
The design of security protocols is a subtle and difficult art.
The cautions here about specifying the use of IPsec should NOT be taken to
mean that that you should invent your own new security protocol for
each new application.  If IPsec is a bad choice, using another
standardized, well-understood security protocol will almost always give the
best results for both implementation and deployment.  Security
protocols are very hard to design; rolling out a new one will require
extensive theoretical and
practical work to confirm its security properties and will incur both
delay and uncertainty.

</p>
<a name="anchor3"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
The Pieces of IPsec</h3>

<p>
IPsec is composed of a number of different pieces.
These can be used to provide confidentiality, integrity, and replay
protection; though some of these can be configured manually, in general
a key management component is used.  Additionally, the decision about
whether and how to use IPsec is controlled by a policy database of
some sort.

</p>
<a name="anchor4"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
AH and ESP</h3>

<p>
The Authentication Header (AH) <a class='info' href='#RFC2402'>[RFC2402]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and R. Atkinson, &ldquo;IP Authentication Header,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> and the Encapsulating Security
Protocol (ESP) <a class='info' href='#RFC2406'>[RFC2406]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and R. Atkinson, &ldquo;IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP),&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> are the over-the-wire security protocols.  Both
provide (optional) replay protection.
ESP typically is used to provide confidentiality (encryption),
integrity and authentication for traffic. ESP also can provide
integrity and authentication without confidentiality, which makes
it a good alternative to AH in most cases where confidentiality is
not a required or desired service. Finally, ESP can be used to
provide confidentiality alone, although this is not recommended
<a class='info' href='#Bell96'>[Bell96]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bellovin, S., &ldquo;Problem Areas for the IP Security Protocols,&rdquo; 1996.</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>
The difference in integrity protection offered by AH
is that AH protects portions
of the preceding IP header, including the source and destination
address.
However, if ESP is used in tunnel mode
(see <a class='info' href='#tunnel'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Transport and Tunnel Mode</span><span>)</span></a>) and
integrity/authentication is enabled, the IP header seen by the
source and destination hosts is completely protected anyway.

</p>
<p>
AH can also protect those IP options that need to be seen by 
intermediate routers, but must be intact and authentic
when delivered to the receiving system.  At this time, use
(and existence) of such
IP options is extremely rare. 

</p>
<p>
If an application requires such protection, and if the
information to be protected cannot be inferred from the key management
process, AH must be used.  (ESP is generally regarded as easier to
implement; however, virtually all IPsec packages support both.)
If confidentiality is required, ESP must be used.
It is possible to use AH in conjunction with ESP, but this combination
is rarely required.

</p>
<p>
All variants of IPsec have problems with NAT boxes -- see
<a class='info' href='#RFC3715'>[RFC3715]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aboba, B. and W. Dixon, &ldquo;IPsec-Network Address Translation (NAT) Compatibility Requirements,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> for details -- but AH is considerably more troublesome.
In environments where there is substantial likelihood that the
two end-points will be separated by a NAT box --
this includes almost all
services involving user-to-server traffic, as opposed to server-to-server
traffic --
NAT traversal <a class='info' href='#RFC3948'>[RFC3948]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huttunen, A., Swander, B., Volpe, V., DiBurro, L., and M. Stenberg, &ldquo;UDP Encapsulation of IPsec ESP Packets,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>
should be mandated and
AH should be avoided.
(Note that <a class='info' href='#RFC3948'>[RFC3948]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huttunen, A., Swander, B., Volpe, V., DiBurro, L., and M. Stenberg, &ldquo;UDP Encapsulation of IPsec ESP Packets,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> is for ESP only,
and cannot be used for AH.)

</p>
<a name="tunnel"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Transport and Tunnel Mode</h3>

<p>
AH and ESP can both be used in either transport mode or tunnel mode.
In tunnel mode, the IPsec header is followed by an inner IP header;
this is the normal usage for Virtual Private Networks (VPN),
and it is generally required whenever either end of the IPsec-protected
path is not the ultimate IP destination, e.g., when IPsec is
implemented in a firewall, router, etc.

</p>
<p>
Transport mode is preferred for point-to-point communication, though
tunnel mode can be used for this purpose.

</p>
<a name="anchor5"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.3.3"></a><h3>3.3.&nbsp;
Key Management</h3>

<p>
Any cryptographic system requires key management.  IPsec provides
for both manual and automatic key management schemes.  Manual
key management is easy; however, it doesn't scale very well.
Also, IPsec's replay protection mechanisms are not available
if manual key management is used.
The need for automatic key exchange is discussed in more
detail in <a class='info' href='#RFC4107'>[RFC4107]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bellovin, S. and R. Housley, &ldquo;Guidelines for Cryptographic Key Management,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>
The primary automated key exchange mechanism for IPsec
is the Internet Key Exchange
(IKE) <a class='info' href='#RFC2409'>[RFC2409]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Harkins, D. and D. Carrel, &ldquo;The Internet Key Exchange (IKE),&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.  A new, simpler version of IKE has been
approved, but there many existing systems still use
IKEv1 <a class='info' href='#RFC4306'>[RFC4306]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaufman, C., &ldquo;Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.  This document does not discuss
IKEv2 and IPsecv3.
A second mechanism, Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK) <a class='info' href='#RFC4430'>[RFC4430]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sakane, S., Kamada, K., Thomas, M., and J. Vilhuber, &ldquo;Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>,
has been defined.
It, of course, uses Kerberos, and is suitable if and only
if a Kerberos infrastructure is available.

</p>
<p>
If a decision to use IKE is made, the precise mode of operation
must be specified as well.  IKE can be used in main mode or aggressive mode;
both support digital signatures, two different ways of using
public key encryption, and shared secrets for authentication.

</p>
<p>
Shared secret authentication is simpler; however, it doesn't scale as well in
many-to-many communication scenarios,
since each endpoint must share a unique secret with every
peer with which it can
communicate.
Note, though, that using shared secrets in IKE is far preferable
to manual keying.

</p>
<p>
In most real-world situations where public key modes of IKE are used,
locally-issued certificates are employed.  That is, the administrator
of the system or network concerned will issue certificates to
all authorized users.  These certificates are useful only for IPsec.

</p>
<p>
It is sometimes possible to use certificates <a class='info' href='#RFC3280'>[RFC3280]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R., Polk, W., Ford, W., and D. Solo, &ldquo;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> from an existing
public key infrastructure (PKI)
with IKE.  In practice, this is rare.
Furthermore, there not only is no global
PKI covering most Internet endpoints,
there probably never will be one.  Designing
a structure which assumes such a PKI is a mistake.
In particular, assuming that an arbitrary node will have an
"authentic" certificate, issued by a mutually trusted third party
and vouching for that node's identity, is wrong.  
Again, such a PKI does not and probably will not exist.
Public key IKE is generally a good idea, but almost always
with locally-issued certificates.

</p>
<p>
Note that public key schemes require a substantial amount of
computation.  Protocol designers should consider whether or not
such computations are feasible on devices of interest to their
clientele.
Using certificates roughly doubles the number of large exponentiations
that must be performed, compared with shared secret versions of IKE.

</p>
<p>
Today, even low-powered devices can generally perform enough computation
to set up a limited number of security associations; concentration
points, such as firewalls or VoIP servers, may require hardware
assists, especially if many peers are expected to create
security associations at about the same time.

</p>
<p>
	Using any automated key management mechanism can be difficult
	when trying to protect low-level protocols.  For example, even
	though <a class='info' href='#RFC2461'>[RFC2461]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., Nordmark, E., and W. Simpson, &ldquo;Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> specified the use of IPsec to
	protect IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, it was impossible to do
	key management: nodes couldn't use IKE because it required
	IP-level communication, and that isn't possible before
	Neighbor Discovery associations are set up.

</p>
<a name="anchor6"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.3.4"></a><h3>3.4.&nbsp;
Applications Program Interface (API)</h3>

<p>
It is, in some sense, a misnomer to speak of the API as
a part of IPsec, since
that piece is missing on many systems.  To the extent that it
does exist, it isn't standardized.  The problem is simple:  it
is difficult or impossible to request IPsec protection, or to
tell if was used for given inbound packets or connections.

</p>
<p>
There are additional problems:

<li>
Applications have rarely access to such APIs.  Rather, IPsec is usually
configured by a system or network administrator.

<li>
Applications are unable to verify that IPsec services
are being used underneath.

<li>
Applications are unaware of the specific identities and
properties of the protected channel provided by IPsec.
For instance, the IPsec key management mechanisms may
be aware of the identity and authorization of the peer,
but this information cannot be used by the application,

to resources reserved to the entity identified by this

Router- or firewall-based

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Availability of IPsec in Target Devices</h3>

<p>
Although IPsec is now widely implemented, and is available for current
releases of most host operating systems, it is less available for
embedded systems.  Few hubs, network address translators, etc.,
implement it, especially at the low end.  It is generally inappropriate to
rely on IPsec when many of the endpoints are in this category.

</p>
<p>
Even for host-to-host use, IPsec availability (and experience, and
ease of use) has generally been for VPNs.
Hosts that support IPsec for VPN use frequently do not
support it on a point-to-point
basis, especially via a stable, well-defined API or user interface.

</p>
<p>
Finally, few implementations support multiple layers of IPsec.  If
a telecommuter is using IPsec in VPN mode to access an organizational
network, he or she may not be able to employ a second level of IPsec
to protect an application connection to a host within the organization.
(We note that such support is, in fact, mandated by Case 4 of Section
4.5 of <a class='info' href='#RFC2401'>[RFC2401]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and R. Atkinson, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Nevertheless, it is not widely available.)
The likelihood of such deployment scenarios should be taken into
account when deciding whether or not to mandate IPsec.

</p>
<a name="anchor8"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
Endpoints</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#RFC2401'>[RFC2401]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and R. Atkinson, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> describes many different forms of endpoint identifier.
These include source addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6), host names
(possibly as embedded in X.500 certificates), and user IDs (again,
possibly as embedded in a certificate).  Not all forms of identifier
are available on all implementations; in particular, user-granularity
identification is not common.  This is especially a concern for
multi-users systems, where it may not be possible to use different
certificates to distinguish between traffic from two different users.

</p>
<p>
Again, we note that the ability to provide fine-grained protection,
such as keying each connection separately, and with per-user
credentials,
was one of the original design goals of IPsec.  Nevertheless, only
a few platforms support it.
Indeed, some implementations do not even support using port numbers
when deciding whether or not to apply IPsec protection.

</p>
<a name="anchor9"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;
Selectors and the SPD</h3>

<p>
Section 4.4 of <a class='info' href='#RFC2401'>[RFC2401]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and R. Atkinson, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> describes the Security Policy Database (SPD)
and "selectors" used to decide what traffic should be protected by
IPsec.  Choices include source and destination addresses (or address
ranges), protocol numbers (i.e., 6 for TCP and 17 for UDP), and port
numbers for TCP and UDP.  Protocols whose protection requirements cannot
be described in such terms are poorer candidates for IPsec;
in particular, it becomes impossible to apply protection at any finer
grain than "destination host".  Thus,
traffic embedded in an L2TP <a class='info' href='#RFC2661'>[RFC2661]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Townsley, W., Valencia, A., Rubens, A., Pall, G., Zorn, G., and B. Palter, &ldquo;Layer Two Tunneling Protocol &quot;L2TP&quot;,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> session cannot be protected
selectively by IPsec above the L2TP layer, because IPsec has no selectors
defined that let it peer into the L2TP packet to find the TCP port
numbers.  Similarly, SCTP <a class='info' href='#RFC2960'>[RFC2960]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stewart, R., Xie, Q., Morneault, K., Sharp, C., Schwarzbauer, H., Taylor, T., Rytina, I., Kalla, M., Zhang, L., and V. Paxson, &ldquo;Stream Control Transmission Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> did not exist when <a class='info' href='#RFC2401'>[RFC2401]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and R. Atkinson, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> was written;
thus, protecting individual SCTP applications on the basis of port
number could not be done until a new document was written <a class='info' href='#RFC3554'>[RFC3554]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bellovin, S., Ioannidis, J., Keromytis, A., and R. Stewart, &ldquo;On the Use of Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) with IPsec,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> that
defined new selectors for IPsec, and implementations appeared.

</p>
<p>
Furthermore, in a world that runs to a large extent on dynamically assigned
addresses and often uses dynamically assigned port numbers as well, an
all-or-nothing policy for VPNs can work well; other policies, however, can be
difficult to create in any usable form.

</p>
<p>
The granularity of protection available may have side-effects.
If certain traffic between a pair of machines is protected by
IPsec, does the implementation permit other traffic to be unprotected,
or protected by different policies?
Alternatively, if the implementation is such that it is only
capable of protecting all traffic or none, does the device have
sufficient CPU capacity to encrypt everything?
Note that some low-end devices
may have limited secure storage capacity for keys, etc.

</p>
<p>
Implementation issues are also a concern here.  As before, too many
vendors have not implemented the full specification; too many
IPsec implementations are not capable of using port numbers in
their selectors.  Protection of traffic between two hosts is thus on
an all or nothing basis when these non-compliant implementations
are employed.

</p>
<a name="anchor10"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.7"></a><h3>7.&nbsp;
Broadcast and Multicast</h3>

<p>
	Although the designers of IPsec tried to leave room for protection
	of multicast traffic, a complete design wasn't finished until much
	later.
	As such, many IPsec implementations do not support multicast.
	<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-msec-ipsec-extensions'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;msec&#8209;ipsec&#8209;extensions]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Weis, B., Gross, G., and D. Ignjatic, &ldquo;Multicast Extensions to the Security Architecture for the Internet  Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>
	describes extensions to IPsec to support it.  Other
	relevant documents include
	<a class='info' href='#RFC3830'>[RFC3830]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Carrara, E., Lindholm, F., Naslund, M., and K. Norrman, &ldquo;MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>,

</p>
<p>
	Because of the delay, protocol designers who use multicast
	should consider
	the availability of these extensions in target platforms of interest.

Specifying IPsec</h3>

<p>
Despite all of the caveats given above, it may still be appropriate
to use IPsec in particular situations.  The range of choices make it
mandatory to define precisely how IPsec is to be used.  Authors of
standards documents that rely on IPsec must specify the following:

</p>
<p>
        </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>
What selectors the initiator of the conversation (the client,
in client-server architectures) should use?
What addresses, port numbers, etc., are to be used?

</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>
What IPsec protocol is to be used:  AH or ESP?  What mode
is to be employed:  transport mode or
tunnel mode?

</dd>
<dt>c.</dt>
<dd>
What form of key management is appropriate?

</dd>
<dt>d.</dt>
<dd>
What form of identification should be used?  Choices include
IP address, DNS name with or without a user name, and X.500 distinguished name.

</dd>
<dt>e.</dt>
<dd>
If the application server will switch userids (i.e., is a login service
of some sort) and user name identification is used, is a new security
association negotiated that utilizes a user-granularity certificate?
If so, when?

</dd>
<dt>f.</dt>
<dd>
What form of authentication should be used?
Choices include pre-shared secrets and certificates.

</dd>
<dt>g.</dt>
<dd>
How are the participants authorized to perform the
operations that they request? For instance, are all
devices with a certificate from a particular source
allowed to use any application with with IPsec or
access any resource?
(This problem can appear with any security service, of course.)

</dd>
<dt>h.</dt>
<dd>
Which of the many variants of IKE must be supported?
Main mode?  Aggressive mode?
<br />

Note that the are two different versions of IKE, IKE and IKEv2.  IKEv2
is simpler and cleaner, but is not yet widely available.  You must
specify which version of IKE you require.

</dd>
<dt>i.</dt>
<dd>
Is suitable IPsec support available in likely configurations of
the products that would have to employ IPsec?

</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
      
</p>
<a name="anchor12"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.9"></a><h3>9.&nbsp;
Example</h3>

<p>
      Let us now work through an example based on these guidelines.
      We will use
Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP) <a class='info' href='#RFC4271'>[RFC4271]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y., Li, T., and S. Hares, &ldquo;A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> to show how to evaluate
and specify the use of IPsec for transmission
security, rather than the mechanism described in <a class='info' href='#RFC2385'>[RFC2385]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Heffernan, A., &ldquo;Protection of BGP Sessions via the TCP MD5 Signature Option,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.
Note carefully that we are not saying that IPsec is an appropriate choice
here.  Rather, we are demonstrating the necessary examination and
specification process.  Also
note that the deeper security issues raised by BGP are not
addressed by IPsec or any other transmission security mechanism;
see <a class='info' href='#Kent00a'>[Kent00a]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S., Lynn, C., and K. Seo, &ldquo;Secure Border Gateway Protocol (Secure-BGP),&rdquo; 2000.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#Kent00b'>[Kent00b]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S., Lynn, C., Mikkelson, J., and K. Seo, &ldquo;Secure Border Gateway Protocol (Secure-BGP) -- Real World Performance and Deployment Issues,&rdquo; 2000.</span><span>)</span></a> for more details.

</p>
<p>
        </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Selectors</dt>
<dd>
BGP runs between manually-configured pairs of hosts on TCP
port 179.  The appropriate selector would be the
pair of BGP speakers, for that port only.
Note that the router's "loopback address" is almost certainly the
address to use.

</dd>
<dt>Mode</dt>
<dd>
Transport mode would be the proper choice if IPsec were used.
The information
being communicated is generally not confidential, so encryption
need not be used.
Either AH or ESP can be used; if ESP is used, the sender's IP
address would need to be checked against the IP address asserted
in the key management exchange.  (This check is mandated
by <a class='info' href='#RFC2401'>[RFC2401]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and R. Atkinson, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.)
For the sake of interoperability, either AH or ESP
would need to be specified as mandatory to implement.

</dd>
<dt>Key Management</dt>
<dd>
To permit replay detection, an automated key management system
should be used, most likely IKE.
Again, the RFC author should pick one.

</dd>
<dt>Security Policy</dt>
<dd>
Connections should be accepted only from the designated peer.
(Note that this restriction applies only to BGP.  If the router -- or
any IPsec host -- runs multiple services with different security needs,
each such service requires its own security policy.)

</dd>
<dt>Authentication</dt>
<dd>
Given the number of BGP-speaking routers used
internally by large ISPs,
it is likely that shared key mechanisms are inadequate.
Consequently, certificate-based IKE must be supported.
However, shared secret mode is reasonable on peering links, or
(perhaps) on
links between ISPs and customers.
Whatever scheme is used, it must tie back to a source IP
address or AS number in some fashion, since other BGP policies are
expressed in these terms.  If certificates are used, would they use
IP addresses or AS numbers?  Which?

</dd>
<dt>Availability</dt>
<dd>
For this scenario, availability is the crucial question.  Do
likely BGP speakers -- both backbone routers and access routers --
support the profile of IPsec described above?
Will use of IPsec, with its attendant expensive cryptographic
operations, raise the issue of new denial of service attacks?
The working group
and the IESG must make these determinations before deciding to use
IPsec to protect BGP.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
IPsec provides transmission security and simple access
control only.  There are many
other dimensions to protocol security that are beyond the scope of
this memo, including most notably availability.  For example,
using IPsec does little to defend against denial of service attacks;
in some situations, i.e., on CPU-limited systems, it may contribute to
the attacks.
Within its scope, the security of any resulting protocol
depends heavily on the accuracy of the analysis that resulted
in a decision to use IPsec.
