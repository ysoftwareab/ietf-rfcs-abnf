 Internet Draft  Passive One-way Delay Measurements    June 2003 
  
  
 1. Introduction 
     
    There exist a variety of motivations for performing passive 
    measurements in IP networks. Many applications require the 
    measurement of the Quality of Service (QoS) for the transport of 
    specific IP flows or traffic aggregates. Network providers and 
    customers are interested whether negotiated QoS values in SLAs 
    are met (SLA validation). Measurements also provide the basis 
    for usage-based accounting. Furthermore, measurement results are 
    an important input for traffic engineering decisions. 
     
    Special motivations for One-way delay measurements are listed in 
    RFC2679. The advantage of passive measurements is that these 
    measurements are based on existing traffic within the network. 
    They provide a statement about the delay of the current traffic 
    in the observed network section. Since no test traffic is 
    generated, passive measurements can only be applied in cases 
    where the kind of traffic we are interested in is already 
    present in the network. This is the case for most applications 
    where a statements about the actual situation in the network is 
    required (like SLA validation, traffic engineering).  
     
    The goodness of the results of passive QoS measurements depend 
    on the choice of the right observation points because the 
    measurement results are only valid between the observation 
    points. 
     
    This draft adopts the terminology of IPFIX, PSAMP and IPPM. 
     
  
 2. Terminology 
     
  
    Collecting Process 
         The collecting process receives records of flow or packet 
         information. The data is stored for later processing (by 
         the calculation process) 
     
    Exporting Process 
         The exporting processes send flow and packet records to the 
         collecting processes. The records are generated by the 
         measurement process. 
     
    IP Packet Selection Process  
         An IP packet selection process takes IP packets or parts of 
         IP packets (e.g. header) as input and extracts a subset of 
         these packets by applying a selection function. 
     
    Filtering  
         Filtering selects a subset of packets by applying 
         deterministic functions on parts of the packet content like 
         header fields or parts of the payload. A filtering process 
         needs to process the packet (look at packet header and/or 
         payload) in order to make the selection decision. 
     
    Measurement Device 
         A measurement device has access to at least one observation 
         point. It is hosting at least one measurement process and 
         one export process. 
     
    Metering/Measurement Process  
         The measurement process generates records of packet and 
         flow information. Packets passing the observation point are 
         captured, timestamped, filtered and classified. The 
         measurement process calculates the packet IDs.

 3. General Architecture 
     
    Passive one-way delay measurements require two measurement 
    processes at two observation points û at a reference and at a 
    monitor observation point. We consider a unidirectional flow of 
    packets as determined by source and destination address of its 
    packets. The mentioned reference observation point is closer to 
    the source of the packets while the monitor observation point is 
    closer to the destination of the flow. The two measurement 
    processes at reference and monitor observation point generate a 
    timestamp and a unique packet ID for each packet as it passes an 
    observation point. The information is sent to a common 
    collecting process. A calculation process uses the data to 
    calculate the one-way delay. (This structure is shown in [Figure 
    3-1: Passive OWD Measurement Setup].)

    For each packet that is measured a timestamp and a packet ID has 
    to be generated, stored and transmitted to a collecting process. 
    Then the delay calculation takes place, based on correlating 
    results from the different observation points. Therefore the 
    amount of measurement result data that arises per second depends 
    on the number of measured packets n per second, the number of 
    bits l_t used for the representation of the timestamp and the 
    number of bits l_id for the packet ID. 
     
    The location of the collecting process does not need to be 
    necessarily physically different from the measurement process. 
    Instead, the collecting process could be co-located with one of

     [Figure 3-2: OWD Measurement Processes] 
     
     
    The processes involved are packet capturing, timestamping, 
    filtering and classification, generation of a packet ID and 
    transfer of measurement data. The requirements for these 
    processes are examined in detail in the following subsections.  
     
    Further issues that must be dealt with are the optimal selection 
    of the observation points, privacy issues when capturing public 
    traffic, difficulties in packet event correlation when packets 
    are lost or duplicated, and the overall amount of measurement 
    data captured and transmitted for evaluation. 
     
    A problem that has to be solved when using multiple measurement 
    points is clock synchronization between these points. Current 
    solutions are based on the Network Time Protocol (NTP) 
    [RFC1305], the Global Positioning System (GPS), and radio 
    signals (e.g. DCF77). Each solution has its own drawbacks and 
    advantages. [RFC2679] explains time keeping related terms like 
    æsynchronizationÆ, æaccuracyÆ, æresolutionÆ and æskewÆ - 
   
 Mark, Pohl, Zseby, Sugauchi  Expires January 2004       [Page 4] 
 Internet Draft  Passive One-way Delay Measurements    June 2003 
  
  
    furthermore, it examines errors and uncertainties caused by 
    imperfect synchronization and clocks. 
  
 4. Observation Point Selection 
     
    The placement of measurement processes is crucial in the sense 
    that the observation point determines the endpoints for the 
    measurement of the delay. When we aim to measure the delay 
    between a source and destination host the locations for the 
    observation points have to be as close as possible to source and 
    destination, respectively. Although strictly speaking we never 
    are able to measure a true end-to-end delay, practically we will 
    have a very good estimation if we obeyed an appropriate 
    observation point selection. 
     
    There is a second point that has a direct impact on observation 
    point determination. We need a priori knowledge of the physical 
    path that packets or flows, that we intend to examine, will 
    follow. Then one has to select measurement processes, which are 
    located at observation points along this path. 
  
 5. Packet Capturing 
     
    A certain amount of bytes needs to be captured per packet as 
    basis for the generation of a packet ID. The packet ID collision 
    probability depends on the generation function and the number of 
    bytes that are used as input. In [DuGr00] it is stated that for 
    IPv4 the first 40 Bytes starting at the IP header are 
    sufficient.  
     
  
 6. Timestamping 
     
    A timestamp can be represented as absolute time. With this, the 
    number of bits needed for the representation of the timestamp 
    depends only on the desired accuracy for the measured metric. A 
    possibility to reduce the number of bits l_t used for the 
    timestamp is to use relative timestamps. One approach is to make 
    an assumption on the maximum time t_max a packet needs to 
    traverse the network from the ingress to the egress measurement 
    point. With this upper limit, the timestamp needs to be non-
    ambiguous only within this limit. In this case the value l_t 
    depends not only on the desired accuracy of the time 
    representation but also on the predetermined limit for the 
    maximum time the packet needs to traverse the network. Another 
    possibility is to use an absolute timestamp only for the first 
    packet in a given time interval [0,t_int] and use timestamps 
    relative to this for successive packets that arrive in the same 
    interval.  
    Further issues are that the time that is needed for the time-
    stamping process can differ for subsequent packets, which can 
    also lead to inaccuracy [ClDG00].  
     
   
 7. Filtering/Classification 
     
    A filtering or classification of packets is required if only 
    selected packets are used for the measurement. A filter is 
    useful to reduce the amount of resulting measurement data and 
    the required processing time for the subsequent processes (like 
    packet ID generation). The classification can filter out packets 
    with specific characteristics as to choose packets from the 
    population of interest. These can be for example all packets 
    that belong to a specific flow or traffic aggregate 
    (characterized by a common DiffServ Codepoint) in order to 
   
 Mark, Pohl, Zseby, Sugauchi  Expires January 2004       [Page 5] 
 Internet Draft  Passive One-way Delay Measurements    June 2003 
  
  
    determine the quality for specific applications or traffic 
    classes.  
    In certain cases it is important to maintain the information to 
    which flow or class the measured packet belongs to. For instance 
    if the quality for different DiffServ traffic aggregates is 
    measured simultaneously it is desired to keep the information 
    about the class together with packet ID and timestamp. 
     
    In some cases, the packet ID already contains additional 
    information because it has been calculated with a bijective 
    function on the fields of information (e.g. a lossless 
    compression function that compresses the IP header can be 
    decompressed to determine the information on source and 
    destination). In all other cases, the wanted information has to 
    be transferred to the analysis application in addition to the 
    packet ID.  
     
     
 8. Packet ID Generation 
     
    Passive measurements are based on methods where packets are 
    neither marked nor modified. Consequently the recognition has to 
    be based on fields that already exist in the packet. In order to 
    get the same packet ID for one packet at both measurement points 
    the packet ID generation should be based only on fields that are 
    invariant or predictable during the transport. Fields that are 
    highly variable between the packets (e.g. the datagram ID for 
    IPv4) are more suitable than fields that are nearly constant or 
    vary only between a few values (e.g. version field). The 
    generation of a packet ID should be based on fields that 
     
       - already exist in the packet (no modification of the 
          packet), 
       - are invariant or predictable during the transport (at least 
          on the path from the ingress to the egress second 
          measurement point) and 
       - are highly variable between the different packets. 
     
    This topic is covered in [RFC2402], in [GrDM98], [DuGr00] and 
    [ZsZC01]. 
     
    The request for low collisions (uniqueness of the ID) 
    contradicts the request for a small packet ID; because the more 
    bits are used for representing the packet ID the lower is the 
    probability of collisions. The collision probability within a 
    traffic trace depends on 
       - the distribution of the bit sequences taken as input to the 
          packet ID generation (that means it is highly dependent on 
          the considered traffic mix), 
       - the packet ID generation function, 
       - the size of the packet ID l_id, 
       - the used Operating System (OS) (if the datagram ID is 
          considered) 
     
    The goal is to achieve an acceptable low probability of 
    collisions with a packet ID that does not exceed the available 
    capacity for the measurement result data transfer. As for the 
    timestamp, the packet ID only needs to be unique in the given 
    time interval [0, t_max]. This limits the number of possible 
    combinations to the number of packets n_max that can be observed 
    within this interval. For example for a 155 Mbits/s link with an 
    average packet size of 512 Bytes and a maximum time to traverse 
    the network of 10s, n_max would be 378,420 packets. This amount 
    of combinations can be represented by 19 bits.

    IPv4 and IPv6 packets have different packet headers. That 
    implies that the fields of the IP packets, which can be used for 
    packet ID generation differ between IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  
     
    IPv4: ip-len, ip-ID, ip-prot, srcaddr, dstaddr, X bytes payload 
    IPv6: payload-len, ip-prot, srcaddr, dstaddr, Y bytes payload 
     
    There are different possibilities to generate an ID from the 
    considered fields: 
       - unprocessed plain  
       - one-way hash function (e.g. MD5) 
       - checksum CRC 
       - compression function 
    Functions that map a large bit sequence (the selected fields of 
    the packet) to a smaller bit sequence (the packet ID) can always 
    increase the collision probability. Using the selected fields of 
    the packet without further processing means to use the 
    calculation basis itself instead of a derived ID. This would 
    lead to the minimum collision probability that ever can be 
    achieved with the given traffic mix. Furthermore it would reduce 
    the required processing power because no function has to be 
    performed on the selected fields. Nevertheless this method would 
    result in a packet ID size m that is equal to the sum of bits in 
    the selected fields. Especially for small packets this would 
    increase the rate required for the measurement report messages 
    up to the rate for the data flow itself. 
     
     
 9. OWD Calculation Process 
  
    To estimate the one-way delay of an IP packet between two 
    observation points Ref (reference) and Mon (monitor) the 
    difference of the arrival times of the packet at the two 
    observation points is calculated: 
     
                          T_owd = T_ref û T_mon 
     
    The correlation between the two timestamps to the same IP packet 
    is done via the packet ID in conjunction with a time window 
    T_delta. If a packet represented by its specific ID is captured 
    at the reference point but its ID is not detected at the monitor 
    point within T_delta the packet is considered as lost. 
     
    Note, that the difference in time, i.e. One-way delay, for a 
    specific packet between two monitor points is semantically 
    equivalent to the singleton metric defined in [RFC2679]. 
     
    The IPPM Framework [RFC2330] refers to packet properties (packet 
    type) as ôtype-Pö. A ôtype-Pö might subsume properties such as 
    protocol (UDP/TCP), size, TOS/DSCP, and so on. For passive One-
    way delay measurements, types of packets that are considered 
    within the metric depend on the applied filter. Therefore, a 
    description of set filters should be provided as part of any 
    result. 
     
     
 10.      Measurement Result Transfer 
     
    In order to calculate QoS parameters like delay, two timestamps 
    have to be compared. Measurement results (timestamps and packet 
    ID) from different observation points have to be collected at a 
    common location in order to calculate the delay value. This 
    collection point can be located on a separate host. It also can 
    be co-located with one of the measurement processes in order to 
    reduce the amount of data that has to be transferred over the

    network. The following possibilities to transfer the measurement 
    results have to be distinguished: 
     
       a) In-band: The measurement results are sent directly on the 
          same path as the data.  
       b) Out-of-band: The measurement results are sent on a separate 
          path. 
     
    Solution a) leads to additional load on the network under test. 
    That means measurement result data packets can influence and 
    distort the original data flow and we might end up with 
    disadvantages that are inherent in active measurements. The in-
    band sending of packets with measurement results therefore 
    somehow contradicts the passive approach where no influence on 
    the original traffic is desired. Nevertheless, there is a 
    difference between sending test traffic for active measurements 
    and the transmission of measurement results. The amount, type 
    and timeframe for the sending of test traffic for active 
    measurements are dictated by the measurement task. In contrast 
    to this, the sending of measurement results can be controlled by 
    other means. For instance, it could be sent with a lower 
    priority (e.g. lower-than-best-effort class) or only at times 
    when the network is lightly loaded, or routed over paths that 
    are currently not loaded (e.g. via MPLS). Which alternative is 
    to be preferred depends on the policy for the evaluation of the 
    metric (e.g. real-time or non-real-time).  
     
    Solution b) requires a separate path to the analysis application 
    or collection point. This can be achieved for instance via a 
    second interface card and a separate measurement network that 
    connects all measurement points. This approach does not 
    influence the data traffic but requires capacity in a different 
    network. 
    In all cases, additional transfer capacity (either within the 
    examined or a separate network) is required. For economic 
    reasons even a separate reporting network would probably have a 
    lower capacity then the ôproduction networkö. As a result, to 
    save resources (storage capacity and bandwidth) the measurement 
    result traffic should be kept as low as possible.  
     
     
 11.      Security Considerations 
     
 11.1    Measurement Infrastructure 
     
    We have to distinguish between two different interfaces of a 
    measurement device: there is one interface to control the 
    devices and to exchange measurement data; a second interface is 
    used to capture the traffic. 
     
    The access to the measurement infrastructure and the measurement 
    devices in particular must be secured in a manner indicated by 
    best known praxis in order to prevent unintended malicious use 
    of the measurement infrastructure. 
     
    Malicious injection of packets into the network under test 
    through the capture interface can be prevented by properly 
    utilizing network taps or optical splitters or by proper design 
    of the physical interface. 
     
 11.2    Exchange of Measurement Data 
     
    The exchange of measurement data is vulnerable and appropriate 
    actions have to be taken to hinder injection of faked 
    measurement data. (However, the design of a data exchange

    protocol is out of the scope of this document. Please refer to 
    IPFIX related documents for further details.) 
     
 11.3    Sensitivity  
     
    When only packet identifier and timestamps are stored then the 
    measurement data itself do not contain sensitive content as long 
    as the packet identifier generation process is irreversible, so 
    that for instance IP addresses cannot be retrieved.
