     Abstract 

        This memo describes the requirements of Internet-Drafts proposing 
        changes to the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4).  
        These requirements specifically cover documentation expected 
        whenever message formats or client state transitions are modified.

     Internet-Draft       DHCPv4 Change Requirements        June 13, 2006 
      
     1 Introduction 

        During the lifetime of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
        (DHCPv4) it has been the subject of 30 Requests for Comments (RFCs) 
        regarding the base protocol (five of which added new DHCPv4 message 
        types or extended the protocol in some way) and 18 RFCs concerning 
        other DHCPv4 options.  Seven RFCs covered procedures and definition 
        of base options.  Additionally, there are constantly a number of 
        Internet-Drafts under consideration for DHCPv4. 

        There has been no standard documentation required to date for new 
        Internet-Drafts concerning DHCPv4, even when proposed changes 
        altered message formats, the client state machine, or processing 
        required of servers, relay agents, or clients.  

        This memo proposes a common-sense minimum standard for documentation 
        required in any new Internet-Draft that will ensure consistency 
        among the various IETF documents and improve the clarity of proposed 
        changes. 

     2 Use of Key Words 

        The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT," 
        "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

     3 Applicability 

     3.1 Assumptions 

        This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the base 
        DHCPv4 protocol as defined in [RFC2131]. 

     3.2 Scope of this Memo 

        This document explicitly restricts itself to DHCPv4, as defined in 
        [RFC2131] and [RFC2132].  The same document change requirements 
        could apply as well to DHCPv6 [RFC3315], although the RFC numbers 
        and document section and page references would be different. 

     4 Minimum Documentation Requirements  

        It SHALL be the policy of the Dynamic Host Configuration (DHC) 
        Working Group that new Internet-Drafts concerning DHCPv4 conform to 
        each of the following requirements: 

     4.1 Description of Message Format Changes 

        An Internet-Draft that proposes any changes to the DHCPv4 message 
        format MUST fully describe the proposed change, and MUST modify or 
        add entries to the message format figures and message requirements 
        tables as appropriate.  These include: 

        1. RFC 2131, Figure 1, "Format of a DHCP message" 

        2. RFC 2131, Figure 2, "Format of the 'flags' field" 

        3. RFC 2131, Table 1, "Description of fields in a DHCP message" 

        4. RFC 2131, Table 2, "DHCP Messages"

     Internet-Draft       DHCPv4 Change Requirements        June 13, 2006 
      
        5. RFC 2131, Table 3, "Fields and options used by DHCP servers" 

        6. RFC 2131, Table 4, "Client messages from different states" 

        7. RFC 2131, Table 5, "Fields and options used by DHCP clients" 

        Figures and tables appearing in other, relevant RFCs MUST also be 
        updated as appropriate. 

     4.2 Description of Client State Machine Changes 

        An Internet-Draft that proposes changes to the DHCPv4 client state 
        machine MUST supply an updated version of the client state 
        transition diagram (RFC 2131, Figure 5) showing event triggers, 
        states, and client actions.  State transition diagrams appearing in 
        other, relevant RFCs MUST also is updated as appropriate. 

     4.3 Description of Behavior Changes 

        An Internet-Draft that proposes changes to the behavior of DHCPv4 
        servers, clients, or relay agents MUST supply an updated description 
        of the modified behavior.  For example, see [RFC2131], Sections 4.3 
        and 4.4, for the description of DHCPv4 server and client behavior, 
        respectively.  Relay Agent behavior is described [as "gateway"] in 
        [RFC951]. 

     5 IANA Considerations 

        None.  This memo does not include any numbering requirements 
        requiring IANA activity. 

     6 Security Considerations 

        None.  This memo does not itself specify behavior or functionality.
