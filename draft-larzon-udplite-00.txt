Abstract

   This document describes the UDP Lite Protocol,  which  is
   similar   to   classic   UDP   [RFC-768],  but  aimed  at
   applications which can handle a partially damaged payload
   in  lossy  network  environments.  If this feature is not
   used, it is semantically identical to classic UDP.

   "SHALL   NOT",  "SHOULD",  "SHOULD  NOT",  "RECOMMENDED",
   "MAY",  and  "OPTIONAL"  in  this  document  are  to   be
   interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

Introduction

   The UDP Lite protocol is  designed  to  provide  flexible
   checksumming  policies  for  applications  that today use

   UDP.  UDP  Lite  is  particularly  useful  for  real-time
   multimedia applications sending data over links with high
   bit-error rates, e.g.,  many  kinds  of  wireless  links.
   This  is  a  class of applications with delay bounds that
   leave little time to repair damage caused by transmission
   errors over the link.

   Many codecs for voice and video cope better  with  errors
   in  the  data  payload  than with loss of entire packets.
   However, no errors are allowed in the  protocol  headers.
   UDPs  checksumming  policy,  where  the  checksum  either
   covers  the  entire  datagram  or  nothing  at  all,   is
   therefore  not  adequate.  A transport protocol is needed
   where a checksum can protect vital  information  such  as
   headers  and  can  ignore  errors  best dealt with by the
   application.

   UDP Lite provides a partial checksum. Each packet can  be
   divided  into  a  sensitive  and an insensitive part. The
   checksum only covers the sensitive part.  Errors  in  the
   insensitive  part  will therefore not cause packets to be
   discarded.

   Compared to classic UDP, the  partial  checksum  provides
   extra   flexibility   for   applications  with  partially
   insensitive data. If the checksum is configured to  cover
   the  entire packet, UDP Lite is semantically identical to
   classic UDP, provided there  is  no  padding  of  the  IP
   datagram after the UDP payload.

Protocol description

   The UDP Lite header is shown  in  figure  1.  Its  format
   differs from classic UDP in that the UDP Length field has
   been replaced with a Checksum Coverage field.

Fields

   The fields ``Source Port'' and ``Destination  port''  are
   defined as in [RFC-768].

   Checksum Coverage is the number of bytes,  counting  from
   the  first  byte of the UDP Lite header, that are covered
   by the checksum. The  UDP  Lite  header  MUST  always  be
   included  in  the checksum, which means that the value of
   the Checksum Coverage field MUST be at least eight.

   Checksum is the 16-bit  one's  complement  of  the  one's
   complement sum of a pseudo-header of information from the
   IP header, the number of bytes specified by the  Checksum
   Coverage  (starting  at  the  first  byte in the UDP Lite
   header),   padded   with  zero  bytes   at  the  end  (if
   necessary)   to   make   a  multiple of two bytes. If the
   computed checksum is zero,  it  is  transmitted   as  all
   ones (the equivalent  in one's complement  arithmetic).

   Like classic UDP, UDP Lite has the conceptually  prefixed
   pseudo-header shown in figure 2.

              0      7 8     15 16    23 24    31
             +--------+--------+--------+--------+
             |          source address           |
             +--------+--------+--------+--------+
             |        destination address        |
             +--------+--------+--------+--------+
             |  zero  |protocol| UDP Lite length |
             +--------+--------+--------+--------+

User Interface

   A user interface should allow the same operations as  for
   classic  UDP.  In addition to this, it must provide a way
   for the sending application to pass the checksum coverage
   value to the UDP Lite module.

IP Interface

   As for classic UDP, the IP module must  pass  the  pseudo
   header to the UDP Lite module.

   The IP MUST NOT pad the IP payload with extra bytes since
   the  length  of  the  UDP  Lite  payload delivered to the
   receiver depends on the UDP Lite  length  passed  in  the
   pseudo header.
