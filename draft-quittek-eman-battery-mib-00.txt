1.  Introduction

   Today more and more managed devices contain batteries that supply
   them with power when disconnected from electrical power distribution
   grids.  Common examples are nomadic and mobile devices, such as
   notebook computers, netbooks, and smart phones.  The status of
   batteries in such a device, particularly the charging status is
   typically controlled by automatic functions that act locally on the
   device and manually by users of the device.

   In addition to this, there is a need to monitor battery status of
   these devices by network management systems.  This document defines a
   portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) that meets the
   requirements for monitoring the status of batteries described in
   [I-D.ietf-eman-requirements].  Managed objects defined in Section 4
   serve for monitoring

   o  the current charge of a battery,
   o  the age of a battery (charging cycles),
   o  the state of a battery (e.g. being re-charged),
   o  last usage of a battery,
   o  maximum energy provided by a battery (remaining and total
      capacity).

   In addition, means are provided for battery-powered devices to send
   notifications when the current battery charge has dropped below a
   certain threshold in order to inform the management system of needed
   replacement.  The same applies to the age of a battery.

   There is already instrumentation for monitoring battery status on
   many battery-driven devices, because this is already needed for local
   control of the battery by the device.  This reduces the effort for
   implementing the managed objects defined in this document.  For many
   devices only additional software will be needed an no additional
   hardware instrumentation for battery monitoring.

   A traditional type of managed device containing batteries is an
   uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system; these supply other devices
   with electrical energy when the main power supply fails.  There is
   already a MIB module for managing UPS systems defined in RFC 1628
   [RFC1628].  This module includes managed objects for monitoring the
   batteries contained in an UPS system.  However, the information
   provided by these objects is limited and tailored the particular
   needs of UPS systems.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB
   modules that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58,RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Structure of the Battery MIB module

   The Battery MIB module defined in this document defines objects for
   reporting information about batteries.  All managed objects providing
   information of the status of a battery are contained in a single
   table called batteryTable.  The batteryTable contains one conceptual
   row per battery.

   If there is an implementation of the Entity MIB module [RFC4133] that
   identifies batteries by individual values for managed object
   entPhysicalIndex, then it is RECOMMENDED that these values are used
   as index values for the batteryTable.

   The kind of entity in the entPhysicalTable of the Entity MIB module
   is indicated by the value of enumeration object entPhysicalClass.
   Since there is no value called 'battery' defined for this object, it
   is RECOMMENDED that for batteries the value of this object is chosen
   to be powerSupply(6).

   The batteryTable contains three groups of objects.  The first group
   (OIDs ending with 2-6) provides information on static properties of
   the battery.  The second group of objects (OIDs ending with 7-14)
   provides information on the current battery state, if it is charging
   or discharging, how much it is charged, its remaining capacity, the
   number of experienced charging cycles, etc.

         +-- r-n Unsigned32  batteryReplacementAlarmCycles(18)

   The third group of objects in this table (OIDs ending with 15-18)
   indicates thresholds which can be used to raise an alarm if a
   property of the battery exceeds one of them.  Raising an alarm may
   include sending a notification.

   The Battery MIB defines two notifications, one indicating a low
   battery charging state and one indicating an aged battery that may
   need to be replaced.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  This list is still to be done.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB modules in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
           ----------        -----------------------
           batteryMIB        { mib-2 xxx }

   Other than that this document does not impose any IANA
   considerations.


7.  Open Issues

7.1.  Battery temperature

   Is there a need to report the temperature of the battery?  The UPS
   MIB does so with object upsBatteryTemperature.

7.2.  Scale of the charge percentage

   Should object batteryCurrentChargePercentage report the percentage of
   the current charge with respect to the nominal battery capacity or
   with respect to the remaining capacity?

7.3.  Define Charging Cycle

   The draft is not clear about what a charging cycle is.  Is there any
   commonly accpted definition of it?

7.4.  Define Battery States 'full' and 'emplty'

   Is a battery 'full' if it is charged 99%?  When is it empty?  Is it
   full if it has reached remaining capacity or only if it has achieved
   nominal capacity?

7.5.  batteryTable Indexing

   Shall we link the index to the pmIndex in the POWER-AWARE-MIB?
