Abstract 
    
   This draft specifies an additional BGP4 (Border Gateway Protocol, 
   version 4, [2]) attribute, named the "QOS_NLRI" attribute, which aims 
   at providing QoS (Quality of Service)-related information associated 
   to the NLRI (Network Layer Reachability Information) information 
   conveyed in a BGP UPDATE message.

Internet Draft        The QOS_NLRI BGP4 attribute            March 2002 
                                     
                                     
2. Introduction 
    
   Providing end-to-end quality of service is probably one of the most 
   important challenges of the Internet, not only because of the massive 
   development of value-added IP service offerings, but also because of 
   the various QoS policies that are currently deployed and enforced 
   within an autonomous system, and which may well differ from one AS 
   (Autonomous System) to another. 
    
   For almost the last decade, value-added IP service offerings have 
   been deployed over the Internet, thus yielding a dramatic development 
   of the specification effort, as far as quality of service in IP 
   networks is concerned. Nevertheless, providing end-to-end quality of 
   service by crossing administrative domains still remains an issue, 
   mainly because: 
    
   - QoS policies may dramatically differ from one service provider to 
     another, 
   - The enforcement of a specific QoS policy may also differ from one 
     domain to another, although the definition of a set of basic and 
     common quality of service indicators may be shared between the 
     service providers. 
    
   Activate the BGP4 protocol for exchanging reachability information 
   between autonomous systems has been a must for many years, and, from 
   this standpoint, the BGP4 protocol is one of the key components for 
   the enforcement of end-to-end QoS policies. 
    
   Therefore, exchanging QoS-related information as well as reachability 
   information in a given BGP UPDATE message appears to be helpful in 
   enforcing an end-to-end QoS policy. 
    
   This draft aims at specifying a new BGP4 attribute, the QOS_NLRI 
   attribute, which will convey QoS-related information associated to 
   the routes described in the corresponding NLRI field of the 
   attribute. 
    
   This document is organized into the following sections: 
    
   - Section 3 identifies the changes that have been made in the 
     document since the last version, 
    
   - Section 4 describes the basic requirements that motivate the 
     approach, based upon the use of an additional BGP4 attribute, 
    
   - Section 5 describes the attribute and its mode of operation, 
    
   - Section 6 elaborates on the use of the capabilities advertisement 
     feature of the BGP4 protocol, 
    
   - Section 7 depicts the preliminary results of an ongoing simulation 
     work,

   - Finally, sections 8 and 9 introduce IANA and some security 
     considerations, respectively. 
    
3. Changes since the last version of this draft 
    
   The current version of this draft reflects the following changes: 
 
   - Slight re-ordering of the beginning of the document, 
    
   - Introduction of a Requirements section (section 4), 
    
   - Developed the simulation results section (section 7), 
    
   - The References section has been updated, 
    
   - Correction of remaining typos. 
     
4. Basic requirements 
    
   The choice of using the BGP4 protocol for exchanging QoS information 
   between domains is not only motivated by the fact this is currently 
   the only inter-domain (routing) protocol activated in the Internet, 
   but also because the manipulation of attributes is a powerful means 
   for service providers to announce QoS information with the desired 
   level of precision.  
    
   The approach presented in this draft has identified the following 
   requirements: 
    
   - Keep the approach scalable. The scalability of the approach can be 
     defined in many ways that include the convergence time to reach a 
     consistent view of the network connectivity, the number of route 
     entries that will have to be maintained by a BGP peer, the 
     dynamics of the route announcement mechanism (e.g., how frequently 
     and under which conditions should an UPDATE message containing QoS 
     information be sent?), etc. 
    
   - Keep the BGP4 protocol operation unchanged. The introduction of a 
     new attribute should not affect the way the protocol operates, but 
     the information contained in this attribute may very well 
     influence the BGP route selection process. 
    
   - Allow for a smooth migration. The use of a specific BGP attribute 
     to convey QoS information should not constrain network operators 
     to migrate the whole installed base at once, but rather help them 
     in gradually deploying the QoS information processing capability. 
 
5. The QOS_NLRI attribute (Type Code XY*) 
                                
   (*): "XY" is subject to the IANA considerations section of this 
   draft.

Internet Draft        The QOS_NLRI BGP4 attribute            March 2002 
                                     
                                     
    
   The QOS_NLRI attribute is an optional transitive attribute that can 
   be used for the following purposes: 
    
   (a) To advertise a QoS route to a peer. A QoS route is a route that 
       meets one or a set of QoS requirement(s) to reach a given (set 
       of) destination prefixes (see [4], for example). Such QoS 
       requirements can be expressed in terms of minimum one-way delay 
       ([5]) to reach a destination, the experienced delay variation 
       for IP datagrams that are destined to a given destination prefix 
       ([6]), the loss rate experienced along the path to reach a 
       destination, and/or the identification of the traffic that is 
       expected to use this specific route (identification means for 
       such traffic include DSCP (DiffServ Code Point, [7]) marking). 
       These QoS requirements can be used as an input for the route 
       calculation process embedded in the BGP peers, e.g. thanks to 
       the activation of a signaling protocol, such as RSVP (Resource 
       ReSerVation Protocol, [8]), 
    
   (b) To provide QoS information along with the NLRI information in a 
       single BGP UPDATE message. It is assumed that this QoS 
       information will be related to the route (or set of routes) 
       described in the NLRI field of the attribute. 
   
  From a service provider's perspective, the choice of defining the 
  QOS_NLRI attribute as an optional transitive attribute is basically 
  motivated by the fact that this kind of attribute allows for gradual 
  deployment of QoS extensions to BGP4: not all the BGP peers are 
  supposed to be updated accordingly, while partial deployment of such 
  QoS extensions can already provide an added value. 
   
  This draft makes no specific assumption about the means to actually 
  value this attribute, since this is mostly a matter of 
  implementation, but the reader is kindly suggested to have a look on 
  document [9], as an example of a means to feed the BGP peer with the 
  appropriate information. The QOS_NLRI attribute is encoded as 
  follows:

   The use and meaning of the fields of the QOS_NLRI attribute are 
   defined as follows: 
    
   -   QoS Information Code: 
    
       This field carries the type of the QOS information. The 
       following types have been identified so far: 
    
   (0) Reserved 
   (1) Packet rate, i.e. the number of IP datagrams that can be 
       transmitted (or have been lost) per unit of time, this number 
       being characterized by the elaboration provided in the QoS 
       Information Sub-code (see below)  
   (2) One-way delay, as defined in [5] 
   (3) Inter-packet delay variation, as defined in [6] 
   (4) PHB Identifier, as defined in [10] 
    
   -   QoS Information Sub-code: 
    
       This field carries the sub-type of the QoS information. The 
       following sub-types have been identified so far: 
    
   (0) None (i.e. no sub-type, or sub-type unavailable, or unknown sub-
       type) 
   (1) Reserved rate 
   (2) Available rate 
   (3) Loss rate 
   (4) Minimum one-way delay 
   (5) Maximum one-way delay 
   (6) Average one-way delay 
    
   The instantiation of this sub-code field MUST be compatible with the 
   value conveyed in the QoS Information code field, as stated in the 
   following table (the rows represent the QoS Information Code possible 
   values, the columns represent the QoS Information Sub-code values 
   identified so far, while the "X" sign indicates incompatibility).

   -   QoS Information Value: 
    
       This field indicates the value of the QoS information. The 
       corresponding units obviously depend on the instantiation of the 
       QoS Information Code. Namely, if: 
    
   (a) QoS Information Code field is "0", no unit specified, 
   (b) QoS Information Code field is "1", unit is kilobits per second 
       (kbps), and the rate encoding rule is composed of a 3-bit 
       exponent (with an assumed base of 8) followed by a 13-bit 
       mantissa, as depicted in the figure below: 
    
                             0      8       16 
                             |       |       | 
                             ----------------- 
                             |Exp| Mantissa  | 
                             ----------------- 
    
       This encoding scheme advertises a numeric value that is (2^16 -1 
       - exponential encoding of the considered rate), as depicted in 
       [11]. 
   (c) QoS Information Code field is "2", unit is milliseconds, 
   (d) QoS Information Code field is "3", unit is milliseconds, 
   (e) QoS Information Code field is "4", no unit specified. 
    
   -   QoS Information Origin: 
    
       This field provides indication on the origin of the path 
       information, as defined in section 4.3.of [2].  
    
    
   -   Address Family Identifier (AFI): 
    
       This field carries the identity of the Network Layer protocol 
       associated with the Network Address that follows. Presently 
       defined values for this field are specified in [12] (see the 
       Address Family Numbers section of this reference document). 
    
   -   Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI): 
    
       This field provides additional information about the type of the 
       NLRI carried in the QOS_NLRI attribute. 
    
   -   Network Address of Next Hop: 
    
       This field contains the IPv4 Network Address of the next router 
       on the path to the destination prefix, (reasonably) assuming 
       that such routers can at least be addressed according to the 
       IPv4 formalism.

Internet Draft        The QOS_NLRI BGP4 attribute            March 2002 
                                     
                                     
    
   -   Network Layer Reachability Information: 
    
       This variable length field lists the NLRI information for the 
       feasible routes that are being advertised by this attribute. The 
       next hop information carried in the QOS_NLRI path attribute 
       defines the Network Layer address of the border router that 
       should be used as the next hop to the destinations listed in the 
       QOS_NLRI attribute in the UPDATE message.   
    
   When advertising a QOS_NLRI attribute to an external peer, a router 
   may use one of its own interface addresses in the next hop component 
   of the attribute, given the external peer to which the route is being 
   advertised shares a common subnet with the next hop address.  This is 
   known as a "first party" next hop information. 
    
   A BGP speaker can advertise to an external peer an interface of any 
   internal peer router in the next hop component, provided the external 
   peer to which the route is being advertised shares a common subnet 
   with the next hop address.  This is known as a "third party" next hop 
   information. 
    
   A BGP speaker can advertise any external peer router in the next hop 
   component, provided that the Network Layer address of this border 
   router was learned from an external peer, and the external peer to 
   which the route is being advertised shares a common subnet with the 
   next hop address. This is a second form of "third party" next hop 
   information. 
    
   Normally the next hop information is chosen so that the shortest 
   available path will be taken. A BGP speaker must be able to support 
   disabling advertisement of third party next hop information to handle 
   imperfectly bridged media or for reasons of policy. 
    
   A BGP speaker must never advertise an address of a peer to that peer 
   as a next hop, for a route that the speaker is originating.  A BGP 
   speaker must never install a route with itself as the next hop. 
    
   When a BGP speaker advertises the route to an internal peer, the 
   advertising speaker should not modify the next hop information 
   associated with the route. When a BGP speaker receives the route via 
   an internal link, it may forward packets to the next hop address if 
   the address contained in the attribute is on a common subnet with the 
   local and remote BGP speakers. 
    
   A BGP UPDATE message that carries the QOS_NLRI MUST also carry the 
   ORIGIN and the AS_PATH attributes (both in eBGP and in iBGP 
   exchanges). Moreover, in IBGP exchanges such a message MUST also 
   carry the LOCAL_PREF attribute. If such a message is received from an 
   external peer, the local system shall check whether the leftmost AS 
   in the AS_PATH attribute is equal to the autonomous system number of 
   the peer than sent the message. If that is not the case, the local

   system shall send the NOTIFICATION message with Error Code UPDATE 
   Message Error, and the Error Sub-code set to Malformed AS_PATH. 
    
   An UPDATE message that carries no NLRI, other than the one encoded in 
   the QOS_NLRI attribute, should not carry the NEXT_HOP attribute. If 
   such a message contains the NEXT_HOP attribute, the BGP speaker that 
   receives the message should ignore this attribute. 
    
6. Use of Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4 
    
   A BGP speaker that uses the QOS_NLRI attribute SHOULD use the 
   Capabilities Advertisement procedures, as defined in [13], so that it 
   might be able to determine if it can use such an attribute with a 
   particular peer. 
    
   The fields in the Capabilities Optional Parameter are defined as 
   follows: 
    
   -  The Capability Code field is set to N (127 < N < 256, when 
      considering the "Private Use" range, as specified in [14]), while 
      the Capability Length field is set to "1". 
    
   -  The Capability Value field is a one-octet field, which contains 
      the Type Code of the QOS_NLRI attribute, as defined in the 
      introduction of section 4 of the present draft. 
    
7. Preliminary simulation results  
    
7.1. A phased approach 
    
   The simulation work that has begun within the context of the TEQUILA 
   project (see [4]) basically aims at qualifying the scalability of the 
   usage of the QOS_NLRI attribute for propagating QoS-related 
   information between domains. This work also aims at quantifying the 
   added value provided by the QoS extensions to BGP4, as a function of 
   the percentage of the accordingly updated BGP peers.  
    
   This effort has also been launched to focus on the impact on the 
   stability of the BGP routes, by defining a set of basic engineering 
   rules for the introduction of new QoS information, as well as design 
   considerations for the calculation of "QoS routes". 
    
   This ongoing development effort is organized into a step-by-step 
   approach, which consists in the following phases: 
    
     1. Model an IP network composed of several autonomous systems. 
        Since this simulation effort is primarily focused on the 
        qualification of the scalability related to the use of the 
        QOS_NLRI attribute for exchanging QoS-related information 
        between domains, it has been decided that the internal 
        architecture of such domains be kept very simple, i.e. without 
        any specific IGP interaction,

     2. Within this IP network, there are BGP peers that are QOS_NLRI 
        aware, i.e. they have the ability to process the information 
        conveyed in the attribute, while the other routers do not: these 
        routers do not recognize the QOS_NLRI attribute by definition, 
        and they will forward the information to other peers, by setting 
        the Partial bit in the attribute, meaning that the information 
        conveyed in the message is incomplete. This approach allows to 
        elaborate on the added value introduced by a gradual deployment 
        of the QoS extensions to BGP4, 
    
     3. As far as QOS_NLRI aware BGP peers are concerned, they will 
        process the information contained in the QOS_NLRI attribute to 
        possibly influence the route decision process, thus yielding the 
        selection (and the installation) of distinct routes towards a 
        same destination prefix, depending on the QoS-related 
        information conveyed in the QOS_NLRI attribute. From this 
        implementation perspective, the BGP routing tables have been 
        modeled so that they contain a "sub-section" where QOS_NLRI-
        capable peers will store the information conveyed in the 
        attribute, 
    
     4. Modify the BGP route decision process: at this stage of the 
        simulation, the modified decision process relies upon the one-
        way delay information (which corresponds to the QoS Information 
        Code field of the attribute valued at "2"), and it also takes 
        into account the value of the Partial bit of the attribute. 
    
   Once the creation of these components of the IP network has been 
   completed (together with the modification of the BGP route selection 
   process), the behavior of a QOS_NLRI-capable BGP peer is as follows:  
    
   Upon receipt of a BGP UPDATE message that contains the QOS_NLRI 
   attribute, the router will first check if the corresponding route is 
   already stored in its local RIB, according to the value of the one-
   way delay information contained in both QoS Information Code and Sub-
   code fields of the attribute.  
    
   If not, the BGP peer will install the route in its local RIB. 
   Otherwise (i.e. an equivalent route already exists in its database), 
   the BGP peer will select the best of both routes according to the 
   following criteria: 
    
   -   If both routes are said to be either incomplete (Partial bit has 
       been set) or complete (Partial bit is unset), the route with the 
       lowest delay will be selected, 
    
   -   Otherwise, a route with the Partial bit unset is always 
       preferred over any other route, even if this (complete) route 
       reflects a higher transit delay.

Internet Draft        The QOS_NLRI BGP4 attribute            March 2002 
                                     
                                     
   If ever both Partial bit and transit delay information are not 
  sufficient to make a decision, the standard BGP decision process 
  (according to the breaking ties mechanism depicted in [2]) is 
  performed. 
    
7.2. A case study 
    
   As stated in the previous section 7.1, the current status of the 
   simulation work basically relies upon the one-way transit delay 
   information only, as well as the complete/incomplete indication of 
   the Partial bit conveyed in the QOS_NLRI attribute. 
    
   The following figures depict the actual processing of the QoS-related 
   information conveyed in the QOS_NLRI attribute, depending on whether 
   the peer is QOS_NRLI-aware or not. 
 
                       [- Figure 1: a case study. -] 
    
   Figure 1 depicts the IP network that has been modelled, while figure 
   2 depicts the propagation of a BGP UPDATE message that contains the 
   QOS_NLRI attribute, in the case where the contents of the attribute 
   are changed, because of complete/incomplete conditions depicted by 
   the Partial bit of the QOS_NLRI attribute. 
    
    [- Figure 2: propagation of one-way delay information via BGP4. -] 
    
   Router S in figure 2 is a QOS_NRLI-capable speaker. It takes 20 
   milliseconds to node S to reach network 192.0.20.0: this information 
   will be conveyed in a QOS_NLRI attribute that will be sent by node S 
   in a BGP UPDATE message with the Partial bit of the QOS_NLRI 
   attribute unset.  
    
   Router A is another QOS_NLRI BGP peer, and it takes 3 milliseconds 
   for A to reach router S. Node A will update the QoS-related 
   information of a QOS_NLRI attribute, indicating that, to reach 
   network 192.0.20.0, it takes 23 milliseconds. Router A will install 
   this new route in its database, and will propagate the corresponding 
   UPDATE message to its peers. 
    
   On the other hand, router B is not capable of processing the 
   information conveyed in the QOS_NLRI attribute, and it will therefore 
   set the Partial bit of the QOS_NLRI attribute in the corresponding 
   UPDATE message, leaving the one-way delay information detailed in 
   both QoS Information Code and Sub-code unchanged.  
    
   Upon receipt of the UPDATE message sent by router A, router E will 
   update the one-way delay information since it is a QOS_NRLI-capable 
   peer. Finally, router D receives the UPDATE message, and selects a 
   route  with  a  40  milliseconds  one-way  delay  to  reach  network 
   192.0.20.0, as depicted in figure 3.

Internet Draft        The QOS_NLRI BGP4 attribute            March 2002 
                                     
                                     
    
   This simulation result shows that the selection of a delay-based 
   route over a BGP route (as depicted in [2]) may not yield an optimal 
   decision. In the above example, the 40 ms-route goes through routers 
   D-E-A-S, while a "truly optimal" BGP route would be through routers 
   D-E-F-A-S, hence a 38 ms-route. This is because of a BGP4 rule that 
   does not allow router F to send an UPDATE message towards router E, 
   because router F received the UPDATE message from router A thanks to 
   the iBGP connection it has established with A.  
    
   These basic observations confirm that the enforcement of a QoS policy 
   between domains by using the BGP4 protocol is obviously conditioned 
   by the BGP4 routing policies that are enforced within each domain. 
    
7.3. Preliminary results 
    
   The following table reflects the first results obtained from a 
   simulation network composed of 9 autonomous systems and 20 BGP peers. 
   The numbers contained in the columns reflect the percentage of 
   serviced requirements, where the requirements are expressed in terms 
   of delay. 
    
   Three parameters have been taken into account: 
    
   -  The percentage of BGP peers that have the ability to process the 
      information conveyed in the QOS_NLRI attribute (denoted as "x% Q-
      BGP" in the following table), 
    
   -  The transit delays "observed" (and artificially simulated) on 
      each transmission link: the higher the delays, the lower the 
      percentage of serviced QoS requirements, 
    
   -  The QoS requirements themselves, expressed in terms of delay: as 
      such, the strongest requirements (i.e. the lowest delays) have 
      less chance to be satisfied.

   While this table demonstrates the technical feasibility of the 
   approach (and how the use of the QOS_NLRI attribute can improve the 
   percentage of serviced QoS requirements), the results presented here 
   remain obviously preliminary, as discussed in the next section. 
    
7.4. Next steps 
    
   The above-mentioned simulation effort will be pursued in order to 
   better qualify the interest of using the BGP4 protocol to convey QoS-
   related information between domains, from a scalability perspective, 
   i.e. the increase of BGP traffic vs. the stability of the network.  
    
   The stability of the IP network is probably one of the most important 
   aspects, since QoS-related information is subject to very dynamic 
   changes, thus yielding non-negligible risks of flapping. 
    
   It is therefore expected that the upcoming versions of this draft 
   will reflect the progress of this simulation work, which will take 
   into account other types of QoS information, among other tracks of 
   evolution. 
    
8. IANA Considerations  
    
   Section 5 of this draft documents an optional transitive BGP-4 
   attribute named "QOS_NLRI" whose type value will be assigned by IANA.

   Section 6 of this draft also documents a Capability Code whose value 
   should be assigned by IANA. 
                                          
9. Security Considerations 
    
   This additional BGP-4 attribute specification does not change the 
   underlying security issues inherent in the existing BGP-4 protocol 
   specification [15].
