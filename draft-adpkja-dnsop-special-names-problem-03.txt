   Problem Statement for the Reservation of Top-Level Domains in the
                   Special-Use Domain Names Registry
              draft-adpkja-dnsop-special-names-problem-03

Abstract

   The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet is the
   Domain Name System (DNS).  However, other protocols exist that are
   fundamentally different from the DNS, and may or may not share the
   same namespace.

   When an end-user triggers resolution of a name on a system that
   supports multiple, different protocols (or resolution mechanisms), it
   is desirable that the protocol used is unambiguous, and that requests
   intended for one protocol are not inadvertently answered using
   another.

   RFC 6761 introduced a framework by which a particular domain name
   could be acknowledged as being special.  Various challenges have
   become apparent with this application of the guidance provided in RFC
   6761.  This document aims to document those challenges in the form of
   a problem statement in order to facilitate further discussion of
   potential solutions.

1.  Introduction: DNS, Name space or Name Spaces, Name Resolution
    Protocols

   For a very long time, DNS and the name space have been perceived as
   one and the same.  However, this has not always been the case; in the
   past, other name resolution protocols were popular.  One can remember
   NIS, NIS+, host files, UUCP addresses... Most of those have been
   obsoleted by the DNS in the late 1990s.  More information on the

Internet-Draft     Top-Level/Special-Use Domain Names           May 2016


   history of names and namespaces can be found in
   [I-D.lewis-domain-names].

   More recently, new name resolution protocols have been proposed, each
   addressing a particular need or a particular community.  For example,
   the DONA handle system has been used by the publication industry.
   The Apple "Bonjour" set of protocols, inspired by what was available
   on Appletalk networks, has been developed to perform automatic name
   resolution on a local IP network.  The TOR project is using the onion
   system to obfuscate communications, the GNU Name System (GNS) system
   is using block chains to build a decentralized name system to offer
   "privacy and censorship resistance".  Many more have been proposed.

   Those alternate name resolution protocols do not exist in a vacuum.
   Application developers have expressed a strong desire to build their
   software so it will function in any of those universes with minimal
   changes.  Doing so means that the software has to recognize
   deterministically what kind of name it is dealing with and associate
   it with the corresponding name resolution protocol.  Because of this
   desired lack of explicit signaling, an algorithmic solution
   frequently chosen by application developers consists simply to use a
   special tag padded at the end of a name to indicate an alternate name
   resolution method.  Examples: if a name ends in .local, the software
   uses the Apple Bonjour protocol based on multicast DNS; if the name
   ends in .onion, it uses the TOR protocol; if the name ends in .gnu,
   it uses the GNS protocol, etc... One noteworthy exception to this
   approach is the DONA system that exists independently and has
   developed its own interoperability solution with the DNS.

   A result of the above is that a number of applications have been
   developed (and massively distributed) that have encoded their
   favorite "tag" as a DNS TLD in a free-for-all, beginning their
   existence squatting on that DNS space...  .local, .gnu, .onion
   started out like that.

2.  IETF RFC6761 Special Names

   The IETF used a provision from the IETF/ICANN MoU [RFC2860] section
   4.3 that says that "(a) assignments of domain names for technical
   uses" is to be considered the purview of IETF (as in, outside of the
   scope of ICANN) in order to create a way to reserve such names in a
   list of "special names".  That process is documented in [RFC6761]
   (which curiously does not directly refer the IETF/ICANN MoU).  It was
   first applied for .local and more recently for .onion.  When that
   process was put in place, it was thought it would only be used a
   handful of times.  However, a large number of applications have since
   been made to the IETF.  The .onion evaluation took almost a year and
   has started a massive (and often heated) discussion in the IETF.

Internet-Draft     Top-Level/Special-Use Domain Names           May 2016


   This [RFC6761] process to reserve special name has a number of
   issues, that can be grouped in two categories:

   o  Issues with [RFC6761] itself, including issues discovered during
      the evaluation of .onion

   o  Higher level issues regarding candidate string evaluation and
      relationship with ICANN

3.  Issues with 6761

   1.  It can be use to reserve any names, not just TLDs.  For example,
       it could potentially be used to forbid a registrar to register
       specific names in any TLD.

   2.  [RFC6761] does not mention if the protocol for which it is
       requested to reserve a string should be published as an RFC
       document.  Most applications have, so far, come from outside
       organizations, and the described protocols that have not been
       developed by the IETF.

   3.  [RFC6761] does not provide clear enough direction as to what
       party is responsible for carrying out the evaluation.

   4.  There are ambiguities and no formal criteria on how the IETF can
       (or even whether the IETF should) evaluate the merits of
       applicants to [RFC6761] reservations.  Section 5 of [RFC6761]
       describes seven questions to be answered by an applicant for
       [RFC6761] status.  However, running this process for the .onion
       application showed that those seven questions are inadequate for
       making the determination for whether a particular strings
       qualifies as requiring special/different treatment.

   5.  Placing a string in the [RFC6761] registry does not guarantee
       that DNS queries for names within a reserved domain will not be
       sent over the Internet.  As such, the applicant for [RFC6761]
       status cannot be guaranteed that leakage will not occur and will
       need to take this into account in the protocol design.  Useful
       reservations of top-level domains should be accompanied by
       documentation of realistic expectations of each of the seven
       audiences, and the evaluation of particular requests should
       consider the practical likelihood of those expectations being met
       and the implications if they are not.

   6.  The [RFC6761] registry lists the reserved names but does not
       include direct guidance, neither in free text form nor in machine
       readable instructions, for any of the seven audiences, relying
       instead upon a reference for each entry in the Registry to the

       document that requested its insertion.  Such documents might well
       be opaque to many readers; [RFC6762] is a seventy-page protocol
       specification, for example, which is arguably not the most
       effective way to set expectations of non-technical end-users

4.  Candidate string evaluation and relationship with ICANN

   1.  IETF does not have process to evaluate the proposed strings
       candidate to [RFC6761] status for things like trademark, IPR,
       name collision, etc.. Instead, the IETF relies on document
       reviews, working group and IETF-wide last call, and ultimately a
       decision is made by the IESG.  That decision can be appealed,
       first to the IAB and second to the ISOC board of trusties.

   2.  The IETF "review" process is not foolproof.  [RFC7788] describing
       the "home networking control protocol" was recently published.
       That document includes text instructing devices to use names
       terminating by default with the .home suffix.  [RFC7788] did not
       reference [RFC6761] anywhere and had no IANA sections about this
       reservation.  It was published without anyone noticing this
       during the entire review process.  The issue was caught after the
       publication, and an errata was published.

   3.  There exists now at least 2 streams to take strings out of the
       global namespace: IETF RFC6761 "special names" and ICANN "gTLD
       program" (see [NEW-GTLD]).  It is important to observed that the
       IETF RFC6761 reservations could happen in a ad-hoc fashion at any
       time, while ICANN delegations typically happen in batches, and
       the latest gTLD round is closed.  Note: the ICANN gTLD
       application process is described in the applicant guide book
       [GUIDEBOOK].

   4.  The major risk is having a conflict when both the IETF and ICANN
       want to use the same or similar strings.  There exist no defined
       cooperation between ICANN and IETF to avoid this problem.

   5.  There might be limited concerns if IETF were to reserve a string
       outside of an ICANN gTLD round.  The next ICANN gTLD applicant
       book would simply refer to the existing list at publication time.
       However, there is a possibility of conflict if an IETF
       reservation were to happen during an ICANN gTLD round.  A
       hypothetical case study could be somebody trying a denial of
       service attack early in the ICANN application process by asking
       the IETF to reserved a string sought after by a competitor.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document aims to provide a problem statement that will inform
   future work.  While security and privacy are fundamental
   considerations, this document expects that future work will include
   such analysis, and hence no attempt is made to do so here.  See among
   other places [SAC-057]

   Reserving names has been presented as a way to prevent leakage into
   the DNS.  However, instructing resolvers to not forward the queries
   (and/or by instructing authoritative servers not to respond) is not a
   guarantee that such leakage will be prevented.  The security (or
   privacy) of an application MUST NOT rely on names not being exposed
   to the Internet DNS resolution system.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
