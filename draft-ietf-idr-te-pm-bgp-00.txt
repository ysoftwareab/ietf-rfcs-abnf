Internet-Draft           BGP for TE performance             January 2014


1.  Introduction

   As specified in [RFC4655],a Path Computation Element (PCE) is an
   entity that is capable of computing a network path or route based on
   a network graph, and of applying computational constraints during the
   computation.  In order to compute an end to end path, the PCE needs
   to have a unified view of the overall topology[I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-
   service-aware].  [I.D-ietf-idr-ls-distribution] describes a mechanism
   by which links state and traffic engineering information can be
   collected from networks and shared with external components using the
   BGP routing protocol.  This mechanism can be used by both PCE and
   ALTO server to gather information about the topologies and
   capabilities of the network.

   With the growth of network virtualization technology, the needs for
   inter-connection between various overlay technologies (e.g.
   Enterprise BGP/MPLS IP VPNs) in the Wide Area Network (WAN) become
   important.  The Network performance or QoS requirements such as
   latency, limited bandwidth, packet loss, and jitter, are all critical
   factors that must be taken into account in the end to end path
   computation ([I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-service-aware]) and selection which
   enable establishing segment overlay tunnel between overlay nodes and
   stitching them together to compute end to end path.

   In order to populate network performance information like link
   latency, latency variation, packet loss and bandwidth into TED and
   ALTO server, this document describes extensions to BGP protocol, that
   can be used to distribute network performance information (such as
   link delay, delay variation, packet loss, residual bandwidth,
   available bandwidth, and utilized bandwidth).  The network
   performance information can be distributed in the same way as link
   state information distribution,i.e., either directly or via a peer
   BGP speaker (see figure 1 of [I.D-ietf-idr-ls-distribution]).

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  MPLS-TE with H-PCE

   For inter-AS path computation the Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) [RFC6805]
   may be used to compute the optimal sequence of domains.  Within the
   H-PCE architecture, the child PCE communicates domain connectivity
   information to the parent PCE, and the parent PCE will use this
   information to compute a multi-domain path based on the optimal TE
   links between domains [I.D-ietf-pce-hierarchy-extensions] for the
   end-to-end path.

   The following figure demonstrates how a parent PCE may obtain TE
   performance information beyond that contained in the LINK_STATE
   attributes [I.D-ietf-idr-ls-distribution] using the mechanism
   described in this document.

3.2.  ALTO Server Network API

   The ALTO Server can aggregate information from multiple systems to
   provide an abstract and unified view that can be more useful to
   applications.

   The following figure shows how an ALTO Server can get TE performance
   information from the underlying network beyond that contained in the
   LINK_STATE attributes [I.D-ietf-idr-ls-distribution] using the

4.  Carrying TE Performance information in BGP

   This document proposes new BGP TE performance TLVs that can be
   announced as attribute in the BGP-LS attribute (defined in [I.D-ietf-
   idr-ls-distribution]) to distribute network performance information.
   The extensions in this document build on the ones provided in BGP-LS
   [I.D-ietf-idr-ls-distribution] and BGP-4 [RFC4271].

   BGP-LS attribute defined in [I.D-ietf-idr-ls-distribution] has nested
   TLVs which allow the BGP-LS attribute to be readily extended.  This
   document proposes seven additional TLVs as its attributes:

      Type            Value

      TBD1        Unidirectional Link Delay

      TBD2        Min/Max Unidirectional Link Delay

      TBD3        Unidirectional Delay Variation

      TBD4        Unidirectional Packet Loss

      TBD5        Unidirectional Residual Bandwidth

      TBD6        Unidirectional Available Bandwidth

      TBD7        Unidirectional Utilized Bandwidth


   As can be seen in the list above, the TLVs described in this document
   carry different types of network performance information.  These TLVs
   include a bit called the Anomalous (or "A") bit at the left-most bit
   after length field of each TLV defined in figure 4 of [[I.D-ietf-idr-
   ls-distribution]].  The other bits in the first octets after length
   field of each TLV is reserved for future use.  When the A bit is
   clear (or when the TLV does not include an A bit), the TLV describes
   steady state link performance.  This information could conceivably be
   used to construct a steady state performance topology for initial
   tunnel path computation, or to verify alternative failover paths.

   When network performance downgrades and exceeds configurable maximum
   thresholds, a TLV with the A bit set is advertised.  These TLVs could
   be used by the receiving BGP peer to determine whether to redirect
   failing traffic to a backup path, or whether to calculate an entirely
   new path.  If link performance improves later and falls below a
   configurable value, that TLV can be re- advertised with the Anomalous
   bit cleared.  In this case, a receiving BGP peer can conceivably do
   whatever re-optimization (or failback) it wishes to do (including

   nothing).

   Note that when a TLV does not include the A bit, that TLV cannot be
   used for failover purposes.  The A bit was intentionally omitted from
   some TLVs to help mitigate oscillations.

   Consistent with existing ISIS TE specifications [ISIS-TE-METRIC], the
   bandwidth advertisements, the delay and delay variation
   advertisements, packet loss defined in this document MUST be encoded
   in the same unit as one defined in IS-IS Extended IS Reachability
   sub-TLVs [ISIS-TE-METRIC].  All values (except residual bandwidth)
   MUST be obtained by a filter that is reasonably representative of an
   average or calculated as rolling averages where the averaging period
   MUST be a configurable period of time.  The measurement interval, any
   filter coefficients, and any advertisement intervals MUST be
   configurable per sub-TLV in the same way as ones defined in section 5
   of [ISIS-TE-METRIC].

5.  Attribute TLV Details

   Link attribute TLVs defined in section 3.2.2 of [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-
   distribution]are TLVs that may be encoded in the BGP-LS attribute
   with a link NLRI.  Each 'Link Attribute' is a Type/Length/ Value
   (TLV) triplet formatted as defined in Section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-idr-
   ls-distribution].  The format and semantics of the 'value' fields in
   'Link Attribute' TLVs correspond to the format and semantics of value
   fields in IS-IS Extended IS Reachability sub-TLVs, defined in
   [RFC5305].  Although the encodings for 'Link Attribute' TLVs were
   originally defined for IS-IS, the TLVs can carry data sourced either
   by IS-IS or OSPF.

   The following 'Link Attribute' TLVs are valid in the LINK_STATE
   attribute:

   +------------+---------------------+--------------+-----------------+
   |  TLV Code  | Description         |     IS-IS    | Defined in:     |
