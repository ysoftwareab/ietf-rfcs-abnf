Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP Data Plane Architecture       February 2010


1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-framework] is
   the set of protocol functions that meet the requirements [RFC5654]
   for the application of MPLS to the construction and operation of
   packet-switched transport networks.  Packet transport networks are
   defined and described in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-framework].

   This document specifies the subset of protocol functions that
   comprises the MPLS-TP data plane: the architectural layer concerned
   with the encapsulation and forwarding of packets within an MPLS-TP
   network.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

1.1.  Scope

   This document has the following purposes:

   o  To identify the data-plane functions within the MPLS Transport
      Profile

   o  To indicate which of these data-plane functions an MPLS-TP
      implementation is required to support

   Note that the MPLS-TP functions discussed in this document are
   considered OPTIONAL unless stated otherwise.

1.2.  Terminology

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-framework] and [RFC5654].


2.  MPLS-TP Packet Encapsulation and Forwarding

   This document defines the encapsulation and forwarding functions
   applicable to packets traversing an MPLS-TP Label Switched Path
   (LSP), Pseudowire (PW), or Section (see Section 3 for the definitions
   of these transport entities).  Encapsulation and forwarding functions
   for packets outside an MPLS-TP LSP, PW, or Section, and mechanisms
   for delivering packets to or from MPLS-TP LSPs, PWs, and Sections,
   are outside the scope of this document.


3.  MPLS-TP Transport Entities

   The MPLS Transport Profile includes the following data-plane
   transport entities:

   o  Label Switched Paths (LSPs)

   o  Sections

   o  Pseudowires (PWs)

3.1.  Label Switched Paths

   MPLS-TP LSPs are ordinary MPLS LSPs as defined in [RFC3031] except as
   specifically noted otherwise in this document.

3.1.1.  LSP Packet Encapsulation and Forwarding

   Encapsulation and forwarding of packets traversing MPLS-TP LSPs MUST
   follow standard MPLS packet encapsulation and forwarding as defined
   in [RFC3031] and [RFC3032], except as explicitly stated otherwise in
   this document.

   Data-plane support for Internet Protocol (IP) packet encapsulation,
   addressing, and forwarding is OPTIONAL.

   Data-plane Quality of Service capabilities are included in the
   MPLS-TP in the form of the MPLS Differentiated Services (DiffServ)
   architecture [RFC3270].  Both E-LSP and L-LSP MPLS DiffServ modes are
   included.  The Traffic Class field (formerly the EXP field) of an
   MPLS label follows the definition of [RFC5462] and [RFC3270] and MUST
   be processed according to the rules specified in those documents.

   The Pipe and Short Pipe DiffServ tunneling and TTL processing models



Frost, et al.            Expires August 28, 2010                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP Data Plane Architecture       February 2010


   described in [RFC3270] and [RFC3443] are included in the MPLS-TP.
   The Uniform model is outside the scope of the MPLS-TP.

   Per-platform, per-interface or other context-specific label space
   [RFC5331] MAY be used for MPLS-TP LSPs.  Note that the requirements
   of a particular LSP type may dictate which label spaces it can use.

   Per-packet Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) load-balancing is outside the
   scope of the MPLS-TP.

   Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) MUST be disabled by default on MPLS-TP
   LSPs.

   Fragmentation procedures as specified in [RFC3032] are outside the
   scope of the MPLS-TP.

3.1.2.  LSP Payloads

   The MPLS-TP includes support for the following LSP payload types:

   o  Network-layer protocol packets

   o  Pseudowire packets

   The rules for processing LSP payloads that are network-layer protocol
   packets SHALL be as specified in [RFC3032] except as specifically
   noted otherwise in this document.

   The rules for processing LSP payloads that are pseudowire packets
   SHALL be as specified in [RFC3985] and the attendant standards
   defined by the IETF Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Working
   Group.

   Note that the payload of an MPLS-TP LSP may be a packet type that
   itself contains one or more MPLS labels.  This is true, for instance,
   when the payload is a pseudowire or another MPLS-TP LSP.  From the
   data-plane perspective, however, an MPLS-TP packet is an MPLS packet
   as specified in [RFC3032], and so in particular has precisely one
   label stack, and one label in the stack with its S (Bottom of Stack)
   bit set to 1.

3.1.3.  LSP Types

   The MPLS-TP includes the following LSP types:

   o  Point-to-point unidirectional





Frost, et al.            Expires August 28, 2010                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP Data Plane Architecture       February 2010


   o  Point-to-point associated bidirectional

   o  Point-to-point co-routed bidirectional

   o  Point-to-multipoint unidirectional

   Point-to-point unidirectional LSPs are supported by the basic MPLS
   architecture [RFC3031] and are REQUIRED to function in the same
   manner in the MPLS-TP data plane except as explicitly stated
   otherwise in this document.

   A point-to-point associated bidirectional LSP between LSRs A and B
   consists of two unidirectional point-to-point LSPs, one from A to B
   and the other from B to A, which are regarded as a pair providing a
   single logical bidirectional transport path.  The nodes A and B are
   REQUIRED to be aware of this pairing relationship, but other nodes
   need not be.

   A point-to-point co-routed bidirectional LSP is a point-to-point
   associated bidirectional LSP with the additional constraint that its
   two unidirectional component LSPs follow the same path in the
   network.  This means that if one of the component LSPs follows the
   path through the nodes N0, ..., Nk, originating on N0 and terminating
   on Nk, then the path of the other component LSP is Nk, ..., N0, and
   that at each node an ingress interface of one component LSP is an
   egress interface of the other.  In addition, each node along the path
   is REQUIRED to be aware of the pairing relationship between the
   component LSPs.

   A point-to-multipoint unidirectional LSP functions in the same manner
   in the data plane, with respect to basic label processing and packet-
   switching operations, as a point-to-point unidirectional LSP, with
   one difference: an LSR may have more than one (egress interface,
   outgoing label) pair associated with the LSP, and any packet it
   transmits on the LSP is transmitted out all associated egress
   interfaces.  Point-to-multipoint LSPs are described in [RFC4875] and
   [RFC5332].

3.2.  Sections

   Two MPLS-TP LSRs are considered to be topologically adjacent at a
   particular layer n >= 0 of the MPLS-TP LSP hierarchy if there exists
   a link between them at the next lowest network layer.  Such a link,
   if it exists, will be either an MPLS-TP LSP (if n > 0) or a data-link
   provided by the underlying server layer network (if n = 0), and is
   referred to as an MPLS-TP Section at layer n of the MPLS-TP LSP
   hierarchy.  Thus, the links traversed by a layer n+1 MPLS-TP LSP are
   layer n MPLS-TP sections.

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP Data Plane Architecture       February 2010


   Note that the MPLS label stack associated with an MPLS-TP section at
   layer n consists of n labels, in the absence of stack optimisation
   mechanisms such as PHP.  Note also that in order for two LSRs to
   exchange MPLS-TP control packets over a section, an additional label,
   the Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) (see Section 4) must
   appear at the bottom of the label stack.

3.3.  Pseudowires

   The data-plane architectures for Single-Segment Pseudowires
   [RFC3985], Multisegment Pseudowires [RFC5659] and Point-to-Multipoint
   Pseudowires [I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-requirements], and the associated
   data-plane pseudowire protocol functions, as defined by the IETF
   Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Working Group, are included
   in the MPLS-TP.

   This document specifies no modifications or extensions to pseudowire
   data-plane architectures or protocols.


4.  MPLS-TP Generic Associated Channel

   The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) mechanism is specified in
   [RFC5586] and included in the MPLS-TP.  The G-ACh provides an
   auxiliary logical data channel associated with MPLS-TP Sections,
   LSPs, and PWs in the data plane.  The primary purpose of the G-ACh in
   the context of MPLS-TP is to support control, management, and OAM
   traffic associated with MPLS-TP transport entities.  The G-ACh MUST
   NOT be used to transport client layer network traffic in MPLS-TP
   networks.


5.  Media-Specific Considerations

   This section discusses considerations for support of the MPLS-TP data
   plane by specific underlying server layer media.

5.1.  Ethernet

5.1.1.  Destination MAC Address Determination

   When two MPLS-TP nodes are connected by a point-to-point Ethernet
   link, the question arises as to what destination Ethernet Media
   Access Control (MAC) address should be specified in Ethernet frames
   transmitted to the peer node over the link.  The problem of
   determining this address does not arise in IP/MPLS networks because
   of the presence of the Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
   [RFC0826] or IP version 6 Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC4861],



Frost, et al.            Expires August 28, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP Data Plane Architecture       February 2010


   which allow the unicast MAC address of the peer device to be learned
   dynamically.

   If existing mechanisms are available in an MPLS-TP network to
   determine the destination unicast MAC addresses of peer nodes - for
   example if the network also happens to be an IP/MPLS network - such
   mechanisms SHOULD be used.  The remainder of this section discusses
   the available options when this is not the case.

   One possibility is for each node to be statically configured with the
   MAC address of its peer.  Static MAC address configuration MAY be
   used in an MPLS-TP network, but can present an administrative burden
   and lead to operational problems.

   Another possibility is to use the Ethernet broadcast address, but
   this may lead to excessive frame distribution and processing at the
   Ethernet layer.  Broadcast traffic may also be treated specially by
   some devices and this may not be desirable for MPLS-TP data frames.

   The preferred approach is therefore to use as the destination MAC
   address an Ethernet multicast address reserved for MPLS-TP.  The
   address allocated for this purpose by the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) is 01-00-5E-XX-XX-XX.  An MPLS-TP implementation
   MUST process Ethernet frames received with this destination MAC
   address by default.

   [Editor's note: Decide what to say about multipoint Ethernet and
   switched links.  Decide if there is a need for protocol mechanisms to
   support learning of the Ethernet unicast MAC addresses of MPLS-TP
   peers that are not also IP peers.]

5.2.  Other Media

   [Editor's note: Decide whether any considerations for media other
   than Ethernet need to be mentioned.]


6.  Security Considerations

   TBD


7.  IANA Considerations

   A future version of this document will detail IANA considerations for
   the allocation of a standard Ethernet multicast MAC address for use
   in MPLS-TP networks.
