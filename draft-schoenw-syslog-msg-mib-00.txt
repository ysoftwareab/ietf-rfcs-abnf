Internet-Draft               SYSLOG-MSG-MIB                   April 2008


1.  Introduction

   SNMP [RFC3410] [RFC3411] and SYSLOG [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol] are
   two widely used protocols to communicate event notifications.
   Although co-existence of several management protocols in one
   operational environment is possible, certain environments require
   that all event notifications are collected by a single system daemon
   such as a SYSLOG collector or an SNMP notification receiver via a
   single management protocol.  In such environments, it is necessary to
   translate event notifications between management protocols.

   This document defines an SNMP MIB modules to represent SYSLOG
   messages and to send SYSLOG messages as SNMP notifications to SNMP
   notification receivers.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580] .


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


4.  Overview

   SYSLOG messages are converted by a SYSLOG to SNMP converter.  Such a
   converter acts as a SYSLOG receiver [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol] and
   implements a MIB module according to the SNMP architecture [RFC3411].
   The converter might be tighly coupled to an SNMP agent or it might
   interface with an SNMP agent via a subagent protocol.

   After initialization, the converter will listen for SYSLOG messages.

Internet-Draft               SYSLOG-MSG-MIB                   April 2008


   On receiving a message, the message will be parsed to extract
   information as described in the MIB module.  A conceptual table is
   populated with information extracted from the SYSLOG message and
   finally a notification may be generated.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2'
   subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.
   When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
   "XXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value.


7.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      syslogMsgTableMaxSize # explain sensitivity
      syslogMsgEnableNotifications # explain sensitivity

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      syslogMsgTableMaxSize # explain sensitivity
      syslogMsgEnableNotifications # explain sensitivity
      syslogMsgFacility # explain sensitivity
      syslogMsgSeverity # explain sensitivity
      syslogMsgVersion # explain sensitivity
      syslogMsgTimeStamp # explain sensitivity
      syslogMsgHostName # explain sensitivity
      syslogMsgAppName # explain sensitivity
      syslogMsgProcID # explain sensitivity
      syslogMsgMsgID # explain sensitivity
      syslogMsgMsg # explain sensitivity
      syslogMsgFlags # explain sensitivity

      syslogMsgSDParamValue # explain sensitivity

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
