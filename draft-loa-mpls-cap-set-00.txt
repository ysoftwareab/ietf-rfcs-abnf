   The functionality defined in those protocols are to some extent
   overlapping, but also complementary. This document specifies a number
   of MPLS Capability sets that can be used to define what is needed
   from an MPLS implementation in order to interwork with other
   implementations. The number of Capability sets might change in the
   future.

1. Introduction

   The set of documents that constitute the MPLS standard, as it is
   being specified by the MPLS Working Group of IETF, offers several
   ways of setting up Label Switched Paths (LSP) for a number of
   applications, including support for traffic engineering and Virtual
   Private Networks.

   The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) has been developed by the MPLS
   WG for the explicit task of doing Label Distribution. Other
   protocols, already in existence and originally developed for other
   purposes, have been adapted or extended to support Label
   Distribution.

   This draft addresses unicast functionality only, multicast is for

   further study.

2. Overview

   It has been frequently noted that the functionality supported by the
   most of the specifications of how you do Label Distribution, for most
   applications, are richer than necessary. MPLS implementations
   implementing parts of one specification or a mix of parts from
   several specification will be viable.

   As all implementations won't support all of the specified mechanisms
   for Label distribution specified in the MPLS standard. This
   introduces the requirement of a tool for describing the compliance
   between MPLS implementations.

3. MPLS Capability set

   This draft introduces the MPLS Capability set as a method of
   specifying the compliance of an implementation to the set of MPLS
   specifications and to other implementations. This draft gives an
   overview of what is needed, in terms of protocols and mechanism, to
   support the MPLS capability sets.

4. Protocol and functional components

   The following functional and protocol component are available in the
   protocols  developed for and/or extended to do label distribution,
   [BGP], [CRLDP], [LSPTUN] and [LDP]. All the specification listed
   below are worked on by the MPLS WG, and is still work in progress.

   Carrying Label Information in BGP-4 [BGP]

   Defines mechanisms for:
      - assigning labels to BGP routes

   Constraint based routing with LDP (CR-LDP) [CRLDP]

   Defines mechanisms for:
      - explicit routed LSPs
      - LSP set up with defined QoS

   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [LDP]

   Defines mechanisms for:
      - basic LDP mechanisms
         - LDP neighbor detection
         - LDP session initiation, maintenance and termination
         - loop detection
      - modes of  label distribution defined in [ARCH]
         - Downstream Unsolicited Independent Control
         - Downstream Unsolicited Ordered Control


Loa Andersson, et.al.      February 22, 1999                    [Page 3]
MPLS Capability set              - 4 -                  Exp. August 1999


         - Downstream On Demand Independent Control
         - Downstream On Demand Ordered Control

   Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels [LSPTUN]

   Defines mechanisms for:
      - explicit routed LSPs
      - dynamic distribution of labels (hop-by-hop mechanism)

5. Defined MPLS Capability set

   An MPLS Capability set defines the set of components that has to be
   supported by an implementation claiming compatibility with the
   capability set. Currently there are 10 Capability sets defined.
   Although there sometimes/frequently is an obviously a relationship
   between the Capability set and an intended use, this draft doesn't
   state the intended use of or the application possible to support by
   the capability set.

   The intention is instead to give a reference framework that offers a
   possibility to classify compatibility of MPLS implementations.  The
   Capability sets is atomic, i.e. it is not possible for an application
   to be compliant to part of a capability set. However it is possible
   for an application to be compliant with one or more capability sets.

5.1 MPLS Capability set #1

   MPLS Capability set #1 includes the following components:
      - LDP basic mechanisms
         - LDP neighbor detection
         - LDP session initiation, maintenance and termination
      - CR-LDP strict explicit routed LSPs

   This Capability set supports explicit routed LSP set up, but does not
   allow loosely routed segments on an explicit route. Note that this
   capability set do not require the loop detection mechanism.

5.2 MPLS Capability set #2

   MPLS Capability set #2 includes the following components:
      - LDP basic mechanisms
      - CR-LDP explicit routed LSPs
      - modes of  label distribution defined in [ARCH]
         - Downstream On Demand Ordered Control

   This Capability set supports explicit routing and allows loosely
   routed segments of an explicit route.

5.3 MPLS Capability set #3

   MPLS Capability set #3 includes the following components:


Loa Andersson, et.al.      February 22, 1999                    [Page 4]
MPLS Capability set              - 5 -                  Exp. August 1999


      - LDP basic mechanisms
      - CR-LDP explicit routed LSPs
      - CR-LDP LSP set up with QoS
      - modes of  label distribution defined in [ARCH]
         - Downstream On Demand Ordered Control

   This Capability set supports explicit routing and allows loosely
   routed segments of an explicit route.

5.4 MPLS Capability set #4

   MPLS Capability set #4 includes the following components:
      - LDP basic mechanisms
      - All the modes of label distribution defined in [ARCH]

   This Capability set is label distribution as defined in [LDP].

5.5 MPLS Capability set #5

   MPLS Capability set #5 includes the following components:
      - LDP basic mechanisms
      - All the modes of label distribution defined in [ARCH]
      - CR-LDP explicit routed LSPs
      - CR-LDP LSP set up with QoS

   This Capability set is label distribution as defined in [LDP] and
   [CRLDP] combined.

5.6 MPLS Capability set #6

   MPLS Capability set #6 includes the following components:
      - LDP basic mechanisms
      - Downstream unsolicited independent control

   This Capability set emulates the behavior of a legacy best effort IP
   network.

5.7 MPLS Capability set #7

   MPLS Capability set #7 includes the following components:
      - RSVP explicit routed LSPs
      - RSVP based dynamic distribution of labels

   This Capability set is label distribution as defined in [LSPTUN].

5.8 MPLS Capability set #8

   MPLS Capability set #8 includes the following components:
      - RSVP explicit routed LSPs
      - LDP basic mechanisms
      - All the modes of label distribution defined in [ARCH]


Loa Andersson, et.al.      February 22, 1999                    [Page 5]
MPLS Capability set              - 6 -                  Exp. August 1999


   This Capability set gives explicit routed LSPs and a hop-by-hop
   mechanism.

5.9 MPLS Capability set #9

   MPLS Capability set #9 includes the following components:
      - Assigning label to BGP routes as defined in [BGP].

   This Capability set could be used with any of capability set 1
   through 7, and will in that case give a possibility to support
   network hierarchy. It could also be used alone.

5.10 MPLS Capability set #42

   MPLS Capability set #42 includes all of the components listed in
   section 4 of this draft.

   An LSR claiming 42 compliance should, with proper configuration, be
   able to inter work with any other LSR compliant with any of the
   capability sets.

5.11 Future extensibility

   The number or capability sets are not static, but might be increased
   or reduced as required, e.g. if the number of protocols specification
   that defines label distribution changes. If there is a need for any
   Capability set that has not been specified here it will be added.
   Likewise, if any of the defined Capabilities sets fall out of use it
   will be removed.


6. Open Issues

   Not applicable.

7. Security

   Not applicable.
