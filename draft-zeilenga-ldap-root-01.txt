Abstract

  The OpenLDAP Project is operating an experimental LDAP [RFC2251]
  referral service known as the "OpenLDAP Root Service."  The automated
  system generates referrals based upon service location information
  published in DNS [RFC1034] SRV [RFC2782] resource records.  This
  document describes this service.

INTERNET-DRAFT         draft-zeilenga-ldap-root-01           2 July 2000


1. Background

  LDAP [RFC2251] directories use a hierarchical naming scheme inherited
  from X.500 [X500].  Traditionally, X.500 deployments have used a
  geo-political naming scheme (e.g. cn=Jane Doe, ou=Engineering,
  o=Example, st=CA, c=US).   However, registration infrastructure and
  location services in many portions of the naming hierarchical are
  inadequate or nonexistent.

  The construct of a global directory requires a robust registration
  infrastructure and location service.  Use of Internet domain-based
  naming [RFC2247] (e.g. uid=jdoe, dc=eng, dc=example, dc=net) allows
  LDAP directory services to leverage the existing DNS [RFC1034]
  registration infrastructure and DNS SRV [RFC2782] resource records can
  used to locate services.


1.1.  The Glue

  Most existing LDAP implementations do not support location of
  directory services using DNS SRV resource records.  However, most
  servers support referral generation to "superior" server(s).  This
  service provides a "root" LDAP service which servers using domain
  based naming may use as their superior referral service.

  Client may also use the service directly to locate services associated
  with an arbitrary Distinguished Name within the domain based
  hierarchy.

  Notice:
    The mechanisms used by service are experimental.  The descriptions
    provided by this document should not be taken as being definitive.
    Definitive mechanisms shall be published in a Standard Track
    document(s).


2. Generating Referrals based upon DNS SRV RRs

  This service returns referrals generated from DNS SRV resource records
  [RFC2782].


2.1. DN to Domain Name Mapping

  The service maps a DN [RFC2253] to a fully qualified domain name using
  the following algorithm:

      domain = null;



Zeilenga                                                        [Page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT         draft-zeilenga-ldap-root-01           2 July 2000


      foreach RDN left-to-right        /* [1] */
      {
          if not multi-valued RDN and
              RDN.type == domainComponent
          {
              if ( domain == null || domain == "." )
              {   // start
                  domain = "";
              }
              else
              {   // append separator
                  domain .= ".";
              }

              if ( RDN.value == "."  )
              {   // root
                  domain = ".";
              }
              else
              {   // append domainComponent
                  domain .= RDN.value;
              }
              continue;
          }
          domain = null;
      }

  Examples:

      Distinguished Name              Domain
      ------------------------------  ------------
      dc=example,dc=net               example.net
      uid=jdoe,dc=example,dc=net      example.net
      dc=.                            .            [2]
      dc=example,dc=net,dc=.          .            [3]
      dc=example,dc=.,dc=net          net          [4]
      dc=example.net                  example.net  [5]
      cn=Jane Doe,o=example,c=us      null
      uid=jdoe,dc=example,c=us        null
      dc=example,o=example,dc=net     net
      dc=example+o=example,dc=net     net
      dc=example,o=us+dc=net          null

  Notes:
  1) A later incarnation of this service may use a right-to-left
     algorithm.

  2) RFC 2247 does not state how one can map the domain representing the



Zeilenga                                                        [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT         draft-zeilenga-ldap-root-01           2 July 2000


     root of the domain tree to a DN.  We suggest the root of the domain
     tree be mapped to the DN "dc=." and that this be reversable.

  3) RFC 2247 states that domain "example.net" should be mapped to the
     DN "dc=example, dc=net", not to "dc=example,dc=net,dc=.".  It is
     not our intent to introduce or support an alternative domain to DN
     mapping.  The algorithm ignores domainComponents to the right of
     dc=.

  4) RFC 2247 states that domain "example.net" should be mapped to the
     DN "dc=example, dc=net", not to "dc=example,dc=.,dc=net".  It is
     not our intent to introduce or support an alternative domain to DN
     mapping.  The algorithm ignores domainComponents to the right of
     dc=. and dc=. if further domainComponents are found to the left.

  5) RFC 2247 states that value of an DC attribute type is a domain
     component.  It should not contain multiple domain components.  A
     later incarnation of this service may map this domain to null or be
     coded to return invalid domain.

  If the domain is null or ".", the service aborts further processing
  and returns noSuchObject.  Later incarnation of this service may place
  abort processing if the resulting domain is a top-level domain.


2.2. Locating LDAP services

  The root service locates services associated with a given fully
  qualified domain name by querying the Domain Name System for LDAP SRV
  resource records.  For the domain example.net, the service would do a
  issue a SRV query for the domain _ldap._tcp.example.net.  A successful
  query will return one or more resource records of form:

    _ldap._tcp.example.net. IN SRV 0 0 389 ldap.example.net.

  If no LDAP SRV resource records are returned or any DNS error occurs,
  the service processing and returns noSuchObject.  Later incarnations
  of this service will better handle transient errors.


2.3. Constructing an LDAP Referrals

  For each DNS SRV resource record returned for the domain, a LDAP URI
  [RFC2255] is constructed.  For the above resource record, the URI
  would be:

    ldap://ldap.example.net:389/




Zeilenga                                                        [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT         draft-zeilenga-ldap-root-01           2 July 2000


  These URIs are then returned in the referral.  The URI are currently
  returned in resolver order.  That is, the server itself does not make
  use of priority or weight information in the SRV resource records.  A
  later incarnation of this service may.


3. Protocol Operations

  This section describes how the service performs basic LDAP operations.
  The service supports operations extended through certain controls as
  described in a later section.


3.1. Basic Operations

  Basic (add,compare,delete,modify,rename,search) operations return a
  referral result if the target (or base) DN can be mapped to a set of
  LDAP URIs as described above.  Otherwise a noSuchObject response or
  other appropriate response is returned.


3.2. Bind Operation

  The service accepts "anonymous" bind specifying version 2 or version 3
  of the protocol.  All other bind requests will return a non-successful
  resultCode.  In particular, clients which submit clear text
  credentials.  will be sent an unwillingToPerform resultCode with a
  cautionary text regarding providing passwords to strangers.

  As this service is read-only, LDAPv3 SASL bind [RFC2829] is not
  supported.


3.3. Unbind Operations

  Upon receipt of an unbind request, the server abandons all outstanding
  requests made by client and disconnects.


3.4. Abandon Operations

  Upon receipt of an abandon request, the server abandons all
  outstanding requests made by client.


3.5. Extended Operations

  The service currently does recognize any extended operation.  Later



Zeilenga                                                        [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT         draft-zeilenga-ldap-root-01           2 July 2000


  incarnations of the service may support Start TLS [RFC2830] and other
  operations.


4. Controls

  The service supports the ManageDSAit control.  Unsupported control are
  serviced per RFC 2251.


4.1. ManageDSAit Control

  The server recognizes and honors the ManageDSAit control [NAMEDREF]
  provided with operations.

  If DNS location information is available for the base DN itself, the
  service will return unwillingToPerform for non-search operations.  For
  search operations, a entry will be returned if within scope and entry
  matches provided filter:

      c: searchRequest {
          base="dc=example,dc=net"
          scope=base
          filter=(objectclass=*)
          ManageDSAit
      }
      s: searchEntry {
          dn: dc=example, dc=net
          objectclass: referral
          objectclass: extensibleObject
          dc: example
          ref: ldap://ldap.example.net:389/
          associatedDomain: example.net
      }
      s: searchResult {
          success
      }

  If DNS location information is available for the DC portion of a
  subordinate entry, the service will return noSuchObject with the
  matchedDN set to the DC portion of the base for search and update
  operations.

      c: searchRequest {
          base="cn=subordinate,dc=example,dc=net"
          scope=base
          filter=(objectclass=*)
          ManageDSAit

INTERNET-DRAFT         draft-zeilenga-ldap-root-01           2 July 2000


      }
      s: searchResult {
          noSuchObject
          matchedDN="dc=example,dc=net"
      }


7. Using the Service

  Servers may be configured to refer superior requests to
  <ldap://root.openldap.org:389>.  This is commonly done via a
  configuration directive such as:

    default ldap://root.openldap.org:389

  Though clients may use the service directly, this is not encouraged.
  Clients should use a local service and only use this service when
  chasing a referral to the service.

  The service supports LDAPv3 and LDAPv2+ [LDAPv2+] clients over
  TCP/IPv4.  Future incarnations of this service may support TCP/IPv6 or
  other transport/internet protocols.


6. Lessons Learned


6.1. Scaling / Reliability

  This service currently runs on a single host.  This host and
  associated network resources are not yet exhausted.  We expect it will
  be.   We believe we can easily scale to meet the demand through common
  distributed load balancing technics.  The service can also easily be
  duplicated locally.


6.2. Protocol interoperability

  This service has able avoided known interoperability issues in support
  variants of LDAP.


6.2.1. LDAPv3

  Though the server does not fully implement LDAPv3 [RFC2251], it
  implements all portions required to provide the service.





Zeilenga                                                        [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT         draft-zeilenga-ldap-root-01           2 July 2000


6.2.2. LDAPv2

  LDAPv2 [RFC1777] does not support the return of referrals and hence
  may not be referred to by this service.  Though a LDAPv2 client could
  connect, it would treat any referral returned to it as an unknown
  error.


6.2.3. LDAPv2+

  LDAPv2+ [LDAPv2+] provides a number of extensions to LDAPv2, including
  referrals.  LDAPv2+, like LDAPv3, does not require a bind operation
  before issuing of other operations.  As the referral representation
  differ between LDAPv2+ and LDAPv3, the service returns LDAPv3
  referrals in this case.  However, as commonly deployed LDAPv2+ clients
  issue bind requests (for compatibility with LDAPv2 servers), this has
  not generated any interoperability issues (yet).


6.2.4. CLDAP

  CLDAP [RFC] does not support the return of referrals and hence is not
  supported.


7. Security Considerations

  This service provides information to "anonymous" clients.  This
  information is derived from the public directories, namely the Domain
  Name System.

  The use of authentication would require clients to disclose
  information to the service.  This would be an unnecessary invasion of
  privacy.

  The lack of encryption allows eavesdropping upon client requests and
  responses.  A later incarnation of this service may support encryption
  (such as via Start TLS [RFC2830]).

  Information integrity protection is not provided as the service.  The
  service is subject to varies forms of DNS spoofing and attacks.  LDAP
  session or operation integrity would provide false sense of security
  concerning the integrity of DNS information.  A later incarnation of
  this service may support DNSSEC and provide integrity protection (via
  SASL, TLS, or IPSEC).

  The service may be subject to a variety of denial of service attacks.
  The service is capable of blocking accessing by a number of factors



Zeilenga                                                        [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT         draft-zeilenga-ldap-root-01           2 July 2000


  (IP address, availability of reverse DNS information, etc.).  These
  capability have yet to be used and likely would be ineffective in
  preventing sophisticated attacks.  Later incarnations of this service
  will likely need more better protection from such attacks.


8. Conclusions

  DNS is good glue.  By leveraging of the Domain Name System, global
  LDAP directories may be built without requiring a protocol specific
  registration infrastructures.

  In addition, use of DNS service location allows global directories to
  be built "ad hoc".  That is, anyone with a domain name can
  participate.  There is no requirement that the superior domain
  participate.
