  ICE Candidate Removal: Remove ICE candidates when they are no longer
                                useful.

Abstract

   This document describes an extension to the Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) that enables ICE agents to signal the removal of
   ICE candidates to the remote ICE agent to prevent the remote ICE
   agent from wasting resources by attempting to use the ICE candidate.

1.  Introduction

   In certain network conditions, ICE agents may find that a local ICE
   candidate is no longer useful and that the remote ICE agent should
   not attempt to use that ICE candidate.

   For example, if an ICE agent is gathering TURN candidates and finds a
   set of better candidates (such as using UDP to the TURN server) than
   candidates already signaled (such as using TCP to the TURN server),
   it may choose to deallocate the worse candidates.  But if it does so,
   the remote ICE agent may waste time and resources attempting to use
   the deallocated TURN candidates.

   Just as trickle-ice optimizes ICE by signaling the addition of an ICE
   candidate, this extension optimizes further by signaling the removal
   of an ICE candidate.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification makes use of all terminology defined by the
   protocol for Interactive Connectivity Establishment in [RFC5245].

   Removal Signal  The messsage signaled between ICE agents that a
      candidate is removed.

   Removed Candidate  An ICE candiate for which a removal signal is
      sent.

   Removing Agent  The ICE agent that sends the removal signal.

   Receiving Agent  The ICE agent that receives the removal signal.

3.  Signaling candidate removal

   This specification does not define the usage of candidate removal
   with any specific signaling protocol.

   However, it will be noted that any signaling protocol must be able to
   unique identify the Removed Candidates.  For example, a combination
   of the component, ip address, protocol (UDP or TCP), and port would
   unique identify a Removed Candidate.

4.  Removing candidates when a removal is signaled

   When a removal signal, the Receiving Agent MUST NOT pair the Removed
   Candiates with any future candidates gathered by the Receiving Agent.
   The Receiving Agent MAY keep the existing candidate pairs that use
   the Removed Candidates and behave as though the Removed Candidates
   had not been removed for those candidate pairs.

   Why would an Receiving Agent choose not to immediately remove
   existing candidate pairs?  Because the Removing Agent MAY choose to
   keep the Removed Candidate capable of receiving ICE checks and
   sending responses so that any ICE checks already sent by the
   Receiving Agent may continue to work briefly so that media can flow
   as quickly as possible, even if over a candidate pair that will soon
   be discarded.

   Both the Removing Agent and the Receiving Agent SHOULD prioritize
   candidate pairs with a Removed Candidate lower than those without a
   Removed Candidate.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requests no actions from IANA.

6.  Security Considerations
