      Content-ID header field in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
                    draft-ietf-sipcore-content-id-09

Abstract

   This document specifies the Content-ID header field for usage in the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The document also updates RFC
   5621, which only allows a Content-ID URL to reference a body part
   that is part of a multipart message-body.  This update enables a
   Content-ID URL to reference a complete message-body and metadata
   provided by some additional SIP header fields.

   This document updates RFC 5368 and RFC 6442, by clarifying their
   usage of the SIP Content-ID header field.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Identifying a body part

   A SIP message consists of a start-line, one or more header fields, an
   empty line indicating the end of the header fields, and an optional
   message-body, as specified in [RFC3261].

   The message-body can be a non-multipart message-body or a multipart
   message-body as specified in [RFC3261].

Internet-Draft              Content-ID in SIP             September 2017


   [RFC5621] defines generic handling of a multipart message-body in a
   SIP message.

   A multipart message-body contains zero, one or several body parts,
   encoded using [RFC2045] format.

   A body part in the multipart message-body is described using header
   fields such as Content-Disposition, Content-Encoding, and Content-
   Type, which provide information on the content of the body part, as
   specified in [RFC5621].  A body part in the multipart message-body
   can also contain a Content-ID header field with an ID value uniquely
   identifying the body part, as specified in [RFC2045].

1.2.  Referencing a body part

   A SIP header field can reference a body part using a Content-ID URL,
   as specified in [RFC5621].

   The Content-ID URL is specified in [RFC2392].  [RFC2392] specifies
   how to identify the body part referenced by a Content-ID URL.  The
   Content-ID URL value is included in the Content-ID header field of
   the body part.

   Examples of SIP header fields referencing a body part using a
   Content-ID URL are:

   o  [RFC6442] specifies how a Geolocation header field references a
      body part using a Content-ID URL, for providing location
      information.
   o  [RFC5368] specifies how a Refer-To header field references a body
      part using a Content-ID URL, to provide a list of targets.

1.3.  Problem statement

   It is currently not specified how to uniquely identify a complete
   message-body of a SIP message using a Content-ID header field, and
   how to reference a complete message-body using a Content-ID URL.

   NOTE: In [RFC5621], the Content-ID URL references a specific body
   part only.

   Some existing specifications, for example [RFC5368], contain examples
   that show usage of a SIP Content-ID header field referencing a
   complete message-body, eventhough such usage has never been
   specified.

1.4.  Consequences

   The examples below shows the consequences of the problem described
   above.

1.4.1.  Example 1

   If a User Agent Client (UAC) sends an INVITE request conveying
   location as specified in [RFC6442], if the UAC decides not to include
   an SDP offer, and if the location is conveyed by value, then the UAC
   needs to include only one MIME entity in the INVITE request.  This
   MIME entity can be, for example, of the application/pidf+xml MIME
   type.

   However, due to [RFC6442] requiring inclusion of a Geolocation header
   field referencing the body part with the location information, the
   UAC includes a multipart message-body with single body part in the
   INVITE request, and includes the location information of application/
   pidf+xml MIME type and an associated Content-ID header field in the
   body part.


     Example message (SIP INVITE):

     INVITE sips:bob@biloxi.example.com SIP/2.0

1.4.2.  Example 2

   If a UAC sends an REFER request including a list of targets as
   specified in [RFC5368], then the UAC needs to include only one MIME
   entity in the REFER request.  This MIME entity is of the application/
   resource-lists+xml MIME type.

   However, due to [RFC5368] requiring inclusion of a Refer-To header
   field referencing the body part containing the list of targets, the
   UAC includes a multipart message-body with single body part in the
   REFER request, and includes the list of targets of application/
   resource-lists+xml MIME type and an associated Content-ID header
   field in the body part.

1.5.  Solution

   In order to solve the problems described above, this document:

   o  Specifies and registers the Content-ID header field as a SIP
      header field; and
   o  Specifies that, when used as a SIP header field, the Content-ID
      header field identifies the complete message-body, and metadata
      provided by some additional SIP header fields, of the SIP message;
      and

Internet-Draft              Content-ID in SIP             September 2017


   o  Updates [RFC5621], to enable a Content-ID URL to reference a
      complete message-body and metadata provided by some additional SIP
      header fields.
   o  Updates [RFC5368] and [RFC6442] by adding explicit text saying
      that a SIP Content-ID header field can be used.

1.6.  Backward compatibility

   If an existing specification only defines the usage of a multipart
   message-body for carrying a single body part to be referenced by a
   Content-ID URL, implementations MUST NOT carry the MIME entity in a
   non-multipart message-body unless the specification is updated to
   explicitly allow it.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Content-ID header field

3.1.  Introduction

   This section defines the usage of the Content-ID header field for
   SIP.

3.2.  Syntax

   The ABNF [RFC5234] for the Content-ID header field is:

Internet-Draft              Content-ID in SIP             September 2017


    Content-ID = "Content-ID" HCOLON msg-id

    msg-id     = "<" id-left "@" id-right ">"

    NOTE: id-left and id-right are specified in [RFC5322]. HCOLON is
    defined in [RFC3261].

    NOTE: When used in a SIP header field, the msg-id syntax has been
    simplified, compared to the syntax in [RFC5322], to disallow the use
    of comments and to adopt to the SIP usage of leading white space.

    The value of Content-Id header field value must be unique in the
    context of a given SIP message, including any embedded MIME
    Content-Id header field values. Note that the SIP Content-ID header
    field value is not expected to be unique among all SIP messages; it
    has no meaning outside of the message in which it is included.


3.3.  Semantics

   The Content-ID header field included in the header fields of a SIP
   message identifies the message-body of the SIP message, and the
   metadata provided by:

   o  a MIME-Version header field, if included in the header fields of
      the SIP message; and
   o  any 'Content-' prefixed header fields (including the Content-ID
      header field itself) included in the header fields of the SIP
      message.

   The Content-ID header field can be included in any SIP message which
   is allowed to contain a message-body.

   NOTE: The message-body identified by the Content-ID header field can
   be a non-multipart message-body or a multipart message-body.

3.4.  Procedures

3.4.1.  User Agent (UA) procedures

   A UA MAY include a Content-ID header field in any SIP message that is
   allowed to contain a message-body.

   A UA MUST NOT include a Content-ID header field in any SIP message
   that is not allowed to contain a message-body.

   The UA MUST set the value of the Content-ID header field to a value
   that is unique in the context of the SIP message.

3.4.2.  Proxy procedures

   A proxy MUST NOT add a Content-ID header field in a SIP message.

   A proxy MUST NOT modify a Content-ID header field included in a SIP
   message.

   A proxy MUST NOT delete a Content-ID header field from a SIP message.

3.4.3.  Example

   The figure shows an example from [RFC5368], where the SIP Content-ID
   header field is used to reference the message-body (non-multipart) of
   a SIP message.

4.  Update to RFC 5368

   This section updates the second paragraph in section 7 of [RFC5368],
   by allowing usage of either a MIME Content-ID header field or a SIP
   Content-ID header field to label the body part or the message-body
   carrying the URI list.


OLD TEXT:

   The Refer-To header field of a REFER request with multiple REFER-
   Targets MUST contain a pointer (i.e., a Content-ID Uniform Resource
   Locator (URL) as per RFC 2392 [RFC2392]) that points to the body part
   that carries the URI list.  The REFER-Issuer SHOULD NOT include any
   particular URI more than once in the URI list.


NEW TEXT:

   The Refer-To header field of a REFER request with multiple REFER-
   Targets MUST contain a pointer (i.e., a Content-ID Uniform Resource
   Locator (URL) as per RFC 2392 [RFC2392]) that points to the body part
   or message-body that carries the URI list. The REFER-Issuer SHOULD
   NOT include any particular URI more than once in the URI list. The
   REFER request can use either a MIME Content-ID header field [RFC4483]
   or a SIP Content-ID header field [RFCXXXX] to label the body part or
   the message-body.



5.  Update to RFC 5621

   This section updates section 9.1 of [RFC5621], by allowing a Content-
   ID URL to reference a message-body and the related metadata
   (Section 3.3), in addition to allowing a reference to a body part.

   In Figure 1, Alice is both the Target and the LS that is conveying
   her location directly to Bob, who acts as an LR.  This conveyance is
   point-to-point: it does not pass through any SIP-layer intermediary.
   A Location Object appears by-value in the initial SIP request as a
   MIME body, and Bob responds to that SIP request as appropriate.
   There is a 'Bad Location Information' response code introduced within
   this document to specifically inform Alice if she conveys bad
   location to Bob (e.g., Bob "cannot parse the location provided", or
   "there is not enough location information to determine where Alice
   is").


NEW TEXT:

   In Figure 1, Alice is both the Target and the LS that is conveying
   her location directly to Bob, who acts as an LR.  This conveyance is
   point-to-point: it does not pass through any SIP-layer intermediary.
   A Location Object appears by-value in the initial SIP request as a
   MIME body, and Bob responds to that SIP request as appropriate.
   Either a MIME Content-ID header field [RFC4483] or the SIP Content-ID
   header field [RFCXXXX] MUST be used to label the location
   information. There is a 'Bad Location Information' response code
   introduced within this document to specifically inform Alice if she
   conveys bad location to Bob (e.g., Bob "cannot parse the location
   provided", or "there is not enough location information to determine
   where Alice is").



7.  Security considerations

   The Content-ID header field value MUST NOT reveal sensitive user
   information.

   If the message-body associated with the Content-ID header field is an
   encrypted body, it MUST NOT be possible to derive a key that can be
   used to decrypt the body from the Content-ID header field value.

8.  IANA considerations

   This specification registers a new SIP header field according to the
   procedures in [RFC3261].
