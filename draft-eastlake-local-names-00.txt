Abstract

   A set of second level domain names are defined under a new top level
   domain name such that local private DNS zones can be maintained
   similar to the private IP addresses reserved in RFC 1918 but which
   locally appear to be part of the global DNS name tree.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           Local DNS Names


1. Introduction

   The global Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is documented in RFC
   1034, 1035, 1591 and numerous additional Requests for Comment. It
   defines a tree of names starting with root, ".", immediately below
   which are top level domain names such as .com and .us as discussed in
   RFC 1591. Below top level domain names there are normally additional
   levels of names.

   Generally the information in the DNS is public and intended to be
   globally accessible.  Certainly, in the past, the model of the
   Internet was one of end-to-end openness.  [RFC 1958]  However, with
   increasing security threats and concerns, firewalls and enclaves have
   appeared. In many cases, organizations have hosts or resources that
   they specifically want to reference with DNS names but which they
   also want to be walled off from global access and even from global
   knowledge of the DNS name.

   In the realm of IP addresses, this has been accomplished by reserving
   three blocks of addresses as documented in RFC 1918.

   In the DNS area, local private names have generally be achieved in
   the past by "splitting" DNS at the enclave boundary, giving different
   answers to resolvers depending or whether they are inside or outside
   of the enclave, using different servers for inside and outside,
   creating fake local root servers, and similar relatively complex
   configuration diddling, which is arguably at variance with the simple
   global tree structure of the DNS.

   The document specifies an alternative approach to achieving the
   effect of local names.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           Local DNS Names


2. The .local Top Level Domain

   The fundamental idea, as described in more detail below, is to define
   second level domains under .local which are served by DNS name
   servers that have private IP addresses.  These server addresses would
   only be routed within the enclave to which the names are local.  Thus
   the servers and the names and resource records inside them would
   automatically be inaccessible outside the enclave.



2.1 Local DNS Servers

   A variety of second level names are provided in the .local zone each
   of which is a delegation point to a zone with some number of name
   servers in one of the private IP address space blocks. The Appendix A
   to this document gives the recommended content of the .local zone.

   Glue records are provided to give private IP addresses for initial
   servers; however, it should be noted that the NS and A records in the
   local zones will dominate the information stored in the .local zone.
   This means that once a resolver has contacted a local server, the
   list of NS RRs in the local zone on that server will control and
   could contain more servers than were given at the chosen ??.local
   delegation point.

   It is only necessary for the local DNS servers to have private IP
   addresses to achieve the effect of local names.  Any address pointers
   associated with these local names would most likely point to private
   IP addresses but could point to global addresses. However, care MUST
   be taken that none of the local DNS servers or any server that might
   cache their output is accessible by any network interface that has a
   non-private IP address.  Otherwise considerable confusion could
   result if local names are resolved by a resolver outside a local
   enclave to private IP addresses which have a different meaning for
   the resolver.



2.2 Local in-addr.arpa Zones

   Inverse lookup of local names corresponding to private IP addresses
   needs to be provided via the in-addr.arpa zone. Appendix B contains
   recommended additions to the in-addr.arpa zone to accomplish this.
   Because of the fixed naming within this zone, different names with
   different numbers of servers can not be provided but two servers
   should be sufficient.  As with the forward ??.local entries, the
   actual NS RRs in the servers serving the private portions of in-
   addr.arpa will dominate.  When one of these is queried by a resolver,
   it can provide information on additional servers for that particular

   subzone in the private IP address portion of the in-addr.arpa tree.



2.3 Name Conflicts

   The intention is that local names would only be used in the enclave
   where the entities they refer to exist, and these names would not be
   exported.  However, experience indicates that such names will leak
   out and can cause confusion and if they can conflict with global
   names or names local to other enclaves.  Use of the .local TLD
   assures no conflict with global names.  To assure no conflict with
   different local names, the domain name of the enclave SHOULD always
   be prefixed to .local.

   For example, a company might have
        www.company.com.xx
   as a globally accessible web server and
        www.company.com.xx.b3.local
   as a web server for internal use only.  The global name could
   normally be resolvable anywhere on the Internet while the local name
   could not be resolved anywhere except within the company enclave.



2.4 Nested Enclaves

   It is possible to have enclaves within enclaves.  In general the best
   way to accomplish this is to use a different portion of the private
   IP address space at each level of enclave.  (Private IP address space
   can be reused in enclaves that are siblings or the like.)  Then
   similar entries to those proposed here for .local can be made in the
   private zone referring to name servers with addresses in the nested
   enclaves IP address space.

3. Security Considerations



3.1 Interaction with DNSSEC

   Although an enclave may derive some small amount of security by
   virtue of its isolation, it will normally be desirable to implement
   DNS security [RFC 2065] within the enclave.  The enclave owner should
   generate their own keys and sign their ??.local zone.  However, a
   signed copy of their public key can not be included in the .local
   zone as it is different for every enclave.  Thus, to authenticate the
   ??.local zone contents, it will be necessary to staticly configure
   the public key for the ??.local zone in local resolvers or cross sign
   the KEY RR at the apex of the local ??.local zone with another key
   that is trusted by local resolvers.



3.2 Network Abuse

   Use of the defined second level domain names under .local in URLs,
   email return addresses, or the like, can cause DNS, SMTP, and many
   other types of references to IP addresses in the RFC 1918 blocks.
   This can occur from within a firewall due to web browsing or email
   processing of web pages or email from virtually anywhere in the
   Internet.  However, this is not a new situation as anyone who
   controls any zone in the DNS, say zone.foo.example, can create
   entries therein with arbitrary IP addresses (including multicast and
   undefined formats) and then, by using these name entries in email,
   web links, etc., cause a variety of spurious protocol connections to
   those addresses.

   Local names may provide another way for network abusers to create
   confusion to cover their tracks and make abuse hard to trace.   But
   ephemeral or unreachable names can be created currently via rapid
   zone changes or delegation to non-existent server.  Use of .local at
   least provides some warning that a name may be unreachable..



3.3 Strength of Privacy Offered

   It should be noted that the privacy of the DNS information protected
   by storing it in servers with private IP addresses is relatively
   weak.  It is completely dependent on the integrity of enclave
   perimeter routing to make these servers inaccessible.

   Software should not depend on local names being accessible only
   within a particular enclave as someone could deliberately create the

   same names within a different enclave even if they include the name
   of the original enclave to try to avoid such conflicts.
