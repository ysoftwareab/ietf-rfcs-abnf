Abstract

   In Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol, the
   Access Controller controls whether Wireless Termination Point should
   forward the traffic for some specified station. This document defines
   a mew messages elements, IEEE Station IP Address, which are used for
   better control of station's access in local-MAC mode of CAPWAP.

1.  Introduction

   The Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol
   (CAPWAP) [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-specification] controls a Wireless
   Termination Point (WTP) whether it should forward the traffic for a
   station via the Access Controllers (AC) by the following message
   elements: Add Station, Add MAC ACL Entry, Add Static MAC ACL Entry.

   In order to avoid IP address anti-spoofing, for any authorized
   station, the WTP may be informed about the binding between the
   physical address and the authorized IP address. The AC should notify
   the binding to the WTP, which is done using CAPWAP Station IP Address
   message element.

1.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-
   specification].

2.  CAPWAP Station IP Address

   The CAPWAP Station IP message element accompanies the Add Station
   message element, and is used to deliver the IP address of the 
   station from the AC to the WTP. This message element may be present
   in the station configuration request and used to control station's
   access to the network avoid IP address spoofing.

   The latest CAPWAP Station IP Adress message element overrides any
   previously received message elements.
   
   The Station IP Address message element has the format shown in the
   following figure:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |Version|  Rsvd |        IP address ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type:   Message_Element_Station_IP_Address (TBD)

   Version:   4-bit version field. When Version = 4, it means IPv4
      address is used; When Version = 6, it means that IPv6 address is
      used.

   Rsvd:   The 24-bit field is reserved for future use. All
      implementations MUST set this field to zero. Receivers MUST 
      ignore all bits not defined for the version of the protocol.

   IP Address: The length of this field is either 4-bye or 16-byte, it
      depends on the value of Version field. When the version filed
      indicates that it's in IPv4 environment, IPv4 address allocated to
      the station is filled in this field. When the version field
      indicates it's in IPv6 environment, IPv6 address is used.

Usage:
   This message element is used in Station Configuration Request as an
   optional message element when local-MAC mode is deployed.
   When this message element is used, it must directly follow Add
   Station message element. The purpose of this message is to enable WTP
   to implement the function of IP address anti-spoofing.
   When the WTP receives Station Configuration Request, its operations
   related to this message element are as follows: 
    (1) When the WTP finds this message element following an Add Station
       , it creates the entry of <IP address, MAC address> for the IP

       address anti-spoofing table from the two message elements.
    (2) If there is no CAPWAP Station IP Address message element 
       directly followed the Add Station, this means that IP address
       anti-spoofing rule doesn't be applied on this station.

   When IP address anti-spoofing is deployed in the centralized WLAN
   system, once the WTP receives the frame from a station, it will check
   the frame against the <IP address, MAC address> table before
   forwarding it:

     If (station's <MAC address, IP addres> present in the table)
            Pass the frame
     Else
            Drop the frame


3.  Type Value Consideration

   The following Message Element type value for CAPWAP Station IP 
   Address message element MUST be assigned by CAPWAP working group:

     Message Element                            Value
     -----------------------------------------------------------
     CAPWAP Station IP Address             Station_IP_Address


4.  IANA Consideration

   This document has no actions for IANA. 


5. Security Considerations

   There is no more security issue introduced by this message element.
