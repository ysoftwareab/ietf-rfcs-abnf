1.  Introduction and Problem Statement

   Wireless operates on a shared medium, and transmissions cannot be
   fully deterministic due to uncontrolled interferences, including
   self-induced multipath fading.  RAW (Reliable and Available Wireless)
   is an effort to provide Deterministic Networking on across a path
   that include a wireless interface.  RAW provides for high reliability
   and availability for IP connectivity over a wireless medium.  The
   wireless medium presents significant challenges to achieve
   deterministic properties such as low packet error rate, bounded
   consecutive losses, and bounded latency.  RAW extends the DetNet
   Working Group concepts to provide for high reliability and
   availability for an IP network utilizing scheduled wireless segments
   and other media, e.g., frequency/time-sharing physical media
   resources with stochastic traffic: IEEE Std. 802.15.4 timeslotted
   channel hopping (TSCH), 3GPP 5G ultra-reliable low latency
   communications (URLLC), IEEE 802.11ax/be, and L-band Digital
   Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS), etc.  Similar to DetNet,
   RAW technologies aim at staying abstract to the radio layers
   underneath, addressing the Layer 3 aspects in support of applications
   requiring high reliability and availability.

   As introduced in [I-D.ietf-raw-architecture], RAW separates the path
   computation time scale at which a complex path is recomputed from the
   path selection time scale at which the forwarding decision is taken
   for one or a few packets.  RAW operates at the path selection time
   scale.  The RAW problem is to decide, amongst the redundant solutions
   that are proposed by the Patch Computation Element (PCE), which one
   will be used for each packet to provide a Reliable and Available
   service while minimizing the waste of constrained resources.  To that
   effect, RAW defines the Path Selection Engine (PSE) that is the
   counter-part of the PCE to perform rapid local adjustments of the
   forwarding tables within the diversity that the PCE has selected for
   the Track.  The PSE enables to exploit the richer forwarding
   capabilities with Packet (hybrid) ARQ, Replication, Elimination and
   Ordering (PAREO), and scheduled transmissions at a faster time scale.

   There are several use cases [I-D.ietf-raw-use-cases] where
   reliability and availability are key requirements for wireless
   heterogeneous networks.  A couple of relevant examples are (i) the
   manufacturing sector, where a plethora of devices are interconnected
   and generate data that need to be reliably delivered to the control
   and monitoring agents; and (ii) the residential gaming, with eXtended
   Reality (XR).

   We can refer to domains managed by a single PCE, as "single-domain
   RAW", where nodes are typically run and managed by a single
   administration entity.  In this scenario, the PSE can make use of
   "tracks" and paths involving only the nodes belonging to this RAW
   domain.

   There are scenarios where hosts are connected to different RAW
   domains and they need to communicate to each other with certain
   reliability and/or availability guarantees, for example in large
   factories where networks might be organized in domains (per
   production lines or building/sites), in residential environments
   where there are different networks (e.g., one at home and one in the
   garden), or even vehicular scenarios (e.g., hosts connected to
   different vehicles).

   Figure 1 shows an example of communication involving two RAW domains.
   As opposed to a single-domain scenario, where a single PCE may
   compute all possible "tracks" at longer time scale, and the PSE
   functionality may perform "subtrack" selection and optimization at a
   shorter time scale using all information available at the domain,
   multidomain scenarios pose additional burdens that are not solved
   yet.

   Each RAW domain operates independently of the other domains.  While
   there exist inter-PCE solutions today, allowing one domain's PCE to
   learn some inter-domain paths, this would not be sufficient, as the
   PSE of one domain would not have full visibility nor capability to
   act on the other domains (e.g., there are no multi-domain OAM
   solutions in place yet), limiting its capability to guarantee any
   given SLA.  Therefore, there is a need to define inter-PSE
   coordination mechanisms across domains.

   There exist today standardized solutions, such as the ones in the
   context of Path Computation Element (PCE), enabling computing multi-
   /inter-domain paths.  As an example, the Hierarchical PCE (G-PCE) was
   defined in RFC 6805 [RFC6805] and is described hereafter.  A parent
   PCE maintains a domain topology map that contains the child domains
   (seen as vertices in the topology) and their interconnections (links
   in the topology).  The parent PCE has no information about the
   content of the child domains; that is, the parent PCE does not know
   about the resource availability within the child domains, nor does it
   know about the availability of connectivity across each domain
   because such knowledge would violate the confidentiality requirement
   and either would require flooding of full information to the parent
   (scaling issue) or would necessitate some form of aggregation.  The
   parent PCE is used to compute a multi-domain path based on the domain
   connectivity information.  A child PCE may be responsible for single
   or multiple domains and is used to compute the intra-domain path
   based on its own domain topology information.

   Solutions like the above are not sufficient alone to solve the multi-
   domain RAW problem, as the PSEs need to have some additional
   information from the other involved domains to be sensitive/reactive
   to transient changes, in order to ensure a certain level of
   reliability and availability in a multi-domain wireless heterogeneous
   mesh network.

   Within a single domain, the RAW framework architecture works, by
   having the PCE in charge of computing the paths (tracks) and the
   PSE(s) taking the short time decisions of which sub-tracks to use.
   Note that the PSE is assumed to be either a distributed functionality
   (performed by every RAW router of the path, which takes forwarding
   decisions based on the local and OAM information that they have), or

Internet-Draft               Multidomain RAW                  March 2022


   a centralized functionality played by the entry (ingress) router in
   the domain (note that if there are multiple ingress nodes, then there
   might be multiple PSEs), which then performs source routing.

   In scenarios with multiple connected RAW domains, running
   uncoordinated RAW solutions in each domain is not sufficient.  PSEs
   would need to have global end-to-end information as well as be
   capable of running OAM mechanisms [I-D.ietf-raw-oam-support] to
   monitor the quality of the selected paths.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms used in this document are defined by the IETF:

      PAREO.  Packet (hybrid) ARQ, Replication, Elimination and
      Ordering.  PAREO is a superset Of DetNet's PREOF that includes
      radio-specific techniques such as short range broadcast, MUMIMO,
      constructive interference and overhearing, which can be leveraged
      separately or combined to increase the reliability.

      PSE.  The Path Selection Engine (PSE) is the counter-part of the
      PCE to perform rapid local adjustments of the forwarding tables
      within the diversity that the PCE has selected for the Track.  The
      PSE enables to exploit the richer forwarding capabilities with
      PAREO and scheduled transmissions at a faster time scale over the
      smaller domain that is the Track, in either a loose or a strict
      fashion.

3.  RAW multi-domain extensions

   Here we specify the new mechanisms and signaling extensions to enable
   inter-domain RAW connectivity.

                    Figure 2: Multi-domain RAW signaling

   Figure 2 shows a signaling flow diagram, taking as baseline scenario
   the one shown in Figure 1, where host1 (connected to node1-2) wants
   to communicate with host2 (connected to node2-3).  An ingress RAW
   node (node1-2) gets a request for connectivity, with a given
   destination RAW node (node2-3) and the desired SLA in terms of
   reliability and availability.  The source and/or destination RAW
   nodes might be hostss.  We next explain each of the steps illustrated
   in the figure:

   1.  The ingress node plays the role of PSE (also referred to as
       PSE@domain1) and requests the computation of the tracks towards
       the destination node2-3 with the intended SLA to the PCE of the
       domain (PCE1).

   2.  PCE1 knows that the destination is in another domain (domain2)
       and that the PCE of the destination domain is PCE2.  PCE1 also
       knows the ingress nodes in domain2 that are connected to domain1.
       How this is done is outside of the scope of this document.  These
       nodes (node2-1 and node2-2) play the role of PSEs@domain2.  PCE1
       requests to PCE2 to compute the available tracks from
       PSEs@domain2 to the destination, and the characteristics of the
       links (link_quality) forming these tracks.  The detail and nature
       of the information provided by PCE2 regarding the links might
       vary depending on the deployment, and is meant to be used by PCE1
       and the PSE@domain1 (node1-2) to compute how to distribute the
       SLA among the domains.

   3.  PCE2 computes the tracks and responds to PCE1, including also the
       characteristics of the links (link_quality).  Examples of
       potential information elements including in the link_quality are:
       available bandwidth, observed reliability, delay, link
       variability/mobility, etc.

   4.  PCE1 provides to the PSE@domain1 the tracks to reach the
       destination, as well as the split of SLAs among domain1 and
       domain2 (SLA1 and SLA2).  An SLA, or a Quality of Service (QoS)
       figure, may include aspects such as, among others: max. delay,
       assured BW, max.  Jitter, packet loss ratio, availability ratio,
       etc.  PCE1 also provides the PSEs@domain2.

   5.  The PSE@domain1 sends a message to each PSE@domain2, in order to
       set-up a direct communication channel to provide OAM information
       useful to the PSE@domain1 for computing the subtracks to use for
       the traffic.  This message includes the SLA that each domain has
       to monitor and guarantee (SLA1 and SLA2).

   6.  Each of the PSEs@domain2 acknowledges the message.  At this
       point, the communication channel is established and the
       PSE@domain1 can start taking decisions at a forwarding time scale
       regarding which paths (subtracks) to use.

   7.  All PSEs, at each domain, start performing OAM procedures
       [I-D.ietf-raw-oam-support], which are key to observe if traffic
       is meeting the desired SLAs (SLA1 and SLA2) and adapt the
       subtracks and tracks if needed.  OAM mechanisms can be applied
       in-band (sharing the traffic's fate) or out-of band.  Note that
       this per-domain distributed OAM is critical to ensure that the
       required SLAs (reliability and availability) are met by reacting
       on a short time scale at each of the involved domains.

   8.  PSEs share aggregated and pre-processed information among them to
       facilitate early detection of issues and computation of
       subtracks.  If a violation of an SLA is detected, the respective
       PSE would notify the domain PCE and the other PSE, so a reaction
       measure can be taken (e.g., selecting different subtracks, taking
       different PAREO decisions, requesting the PCEs to recompute the
       paths and/or adjust the split of the SLAs across the domains).

   Note that this example covers the direction host1-to-host2.  If there
   is traffic in the opposite direction, the process has to be repeated
   in the reverse direction, as paths might not be bidirectional.
