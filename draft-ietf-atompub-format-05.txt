Internet-Draft                Atom Format                   January 2005


1.  Introduction

   Atom is an XML-based document format which describes lists of related
   information known as "feeds".  Feeds are composed of a number of
   items, known as "entries", each with an extensible set of attached
   metadata.  For example, each entry has a title.

   The primary use case that Atom addresses is the syndication of Web
   content such as Weblogs and news headlines to Web sites as well as
   directly to user agents.  However, nothing precludes it from being
   used for other purposes and kinds of content.

   Details of communication protocols between software agents using Atom
   can be found in the Atom Protocol specification [Atom-protocol].

   [[ more motivation / design principles ]]

1.1  Editorial Notes

   The Atom format is a work-in-progress, and this draft is both
   incomplete and likely to change rapidly.  As a result, THE FORMAT
   DESCRIBED BY THIS DRAFT SHOULD NOT BE DEPLOYED, either in production
   systems or in any non-experimental fashion on the Internet.

   Discussion of this draft happens in two fora;

      The mailing list [1]
      The Atom Wiki Web site [2]

   Active development takes place on the mailing list, while the Wiki is
   used for issue tracking and new proposals.

   This document is an early draft and known to be incomplete.  Topics
   marked [[like this]] indicate where additional text is likely to be
   added.

   xmlns="http://purl.org/atom/ns#draft-ietf-atompub-format-05">
     <head>
       <title>Example Feed</title>

       <updated>2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</updated>
     </entry>
   </feed>


1.3  Conformance

   [[ talk about atom documents and atom consumers, and how requirements
   are placed on them ]]

1.4  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML elements and attribute names.  It uses the
   following namespace prefixes for the indicated namespace URIs;

   "atom":  http://purl.org/atom/ns#draft-ietf-atompub-format-05

   Note that the choice of any namespace prefix is arbitrary and not
   semantically significant.

   Atom is specified using terms from the XML Infoset
   [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20011024].  However, this specification uses a
   shorthand for two common terms; the phrase "Information Item" is
   omitted when naming Element Information Items and Attribute



Nottingham & Sayre       Expires July 27, 2005                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                   January 2005


   Information Items.

   Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element," it is
   referring to an Element Information Item in Infoset terms.  Likewise,
   when it uses the term "attribute," it is referring to an Attribute
   Information Item.

   Some sections of this specification are illustrated with fragments of
   a non-normative RELAX NG Compact schema [RELAX-NG].  However, the
   text of this specification provides the definition of conformance.  A
   collected schema appears in an informative appendix.

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                   January 2005


2.  Atom Documents

   This specification describes two kinds of Atom Documents; Atom Feed
   Documents and Atom Entry Documents.

   An Atom Feed Document is a representation of an Atom feed, including
   metadata about the feed, and some or all of the entries associated
   with it.  Its document element is atom:feed.

   An Atom Entry Document represents exactly one Atom Entry, outside of
   the context of an Atom Feed.  Its document element is atom:entry.

   namespace atom =
     "http://purl.org/atom/ns#draft-ietf-atompub-format-05"

   start = atomFeed | atomEntry

   Both kinds of Atom documents are specified in terms of the XML
   Information Set, serialised as XML 1.0 [W3C.REC-xml-20040204] and
   identified with the "application/atom+xml" media type.  Atom
   Documents MUST be well-formed XML.

   Atom constrains the appearance and content of elements and
   attributes; unless otherwise stated, Atom Documents MAY contain other
   Information Items as appropriate.  In particular, Comment Information
   Items and Processing Instruction Information Items SHOULD be ignored
   in the normal processing of an Atom Document.

   Any element in an Atom Document MAY have an xml:base attribute.  XML
   Base [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627] processing MUST be applied to any
   relative reference [RFC3986] present in an Atom Document.  This
   includes such elements and attributes as specified by Atom itself, as
   well as those specified by extensions to Atom.

   Any element in an Atom Document MAY have an xml:lang attribute, whose
   content indicates the natural language of the element's content.
   Requirements regarding the content and interpretation of xml:lang are
   specified in XML 1.0 [W3C.REC-xml-20040204] Section 2.12.

   atomCommonAttributes =
      attribute xml:base { atomUri }?,
      attribute xml:lang { atomLanguageTag }?

3.  Common Atom Constructs

   Many of Atom's elements share a few common structures.  This section
   defines a few such structures and their requirements for convenient
   reference by the appropriate element definitions.

   When an element is identified as being a particular kind of
   construct, it inherits the corresponding requirements from that
   construct's definition in this section.

3.1  Text Constructs

   A Text construct contains human readable text, usually in fairly
   small quantities.


   atomPlainTextConstruct =
      atomCommonAttributes,
      attribute type { "TEXT" | "HTML" }?,
      text

   atomXHTMLTextConstruct =
      atomCommonAttributes,
      attribute type { "XHTML" },
      (text|anyElement)*

   atomTextConstruct = atomPlainTextConstruct | atomXHTMLTextConstruct

3.1.1  "type" Attribute

   Text constructs MAY have a "type" attribute.  When present, the value
   MUST be one of "TEXT", "HTML" or "XHTML".  If the "type" attribute is
   not provided, software MUST behave as though it were present with a
   value of "TEXT".

   Note that MIME media types [RFC2045] are not acceptable values for
   the "type" attribute.

   If the value is "TEXT", the content of the Text construct MUST NOT
   contain child elements.  Such text is intended to be presented to
   humans in a readable fashion.  Thus, software MAY display it using
   normal text rendering techniques such as proportional fonts,
   white-space collapsing, and justification.

   If the value of "type" is "HTML", the content of the Text construct
   MUST NOT contain child elements, and SHOULD be suitable for handling
   by software that knows HTML.  The HTML markup must be escaped; for
   example, "<br>" as "&lt;br>".  The HTML markup SHOULD be such that it



Nottingham & Sayre       Expires July 27, 2005                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                   January 2005


   could validly appear directly within an HTML <DIV> element.
   Receiving software which displays the content MAY use the markup to
   aid in displaying it.

   [[example atom entry w/ escaped markup]]

   If the value of "type" is "XHTML", the content of the Text construct
   MAY contain child elements.  The content SHOULD be XHTML text and
   markup that could validly appear directly within an xhtml:div
   element.  Receiving software which displays the content MAY use the
   markup to aid in displaying it.  Escaped markup is interpreted as a
   text representation of markup, and MUST NOT be interpreted as markup
   itself.

3.2  Person Constructs

   A Person construct is an element that describes a person,
   corporation, or similar entity.

   Person constructs MAY be extended by namespace-qualified element
   children.

   This specification assigns no significance to the order of appearance
   of the child elements in a Person construct.


   atomPersonConstruct =
      atomCommonAttributes,
      (element atom:name { text }
       & element atom:uri { atomUri }?
       & element atom:email { atomEmailAddress }?)


3.2.1  The "atom:name" Element

   The "atom:name" element's content conveys a human-readable name for
   the person.  Person constructs MUST contain exactly one "atom:name"
   element.

3.2.2  The "atom:uri" Element

   The "atom:uri" element's content conveys a URI associated with the
   person.  Person constructs MAY contain an atom:uri element, but MUST
   NOT contain more than one.  The content of atom:uri in a Person
   construct MUST be a URI reference [RFC3986].

   xml:base [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627] processing MUST be applied to the
   atom:uri element's content.

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                   January 2005


3.2.3  The "atom:email" Element

   The "atom:email" element's content conveys an e-mail address
   associated with the persons.  Person constructs MAY contain an
   atom:email element, but MUST NOT contain more than one.  Its content
   MUST be an e-mail address [RFC2822].

3.3  Date Constructs

   A Date construct is an element whose content MUST conform to the
   date-time BNF rule in [RFC3339].


   atomDateConstruct =
      atomCommonAttributes,
      xsd:dateTime


3.4  Service Constructs

   A Service construct is an empty element that conveys the URI of an
   Atom Publishing Protocol [Atom-protocol] service associated with an
   entry or feed.


   atomServiceConstruct =
      atomCommonAttributes,
      attribute href { atomUri }


3.4.1  The "href" Attribute

   The "href" attribute contains the a URI of the service.  atom:service
   elements MUST have a "href" attribute, whose value MUST be a URI
   reference [RFC3986].

   xml:base processing MUST be applied to the "href" attribute.

3.5  Identity Constructs

   An Identity construct is an element whose content conveys a
   permanent, universally unique identifier for the construct's parent.
   Its content MUST be a URI, as defined by [RFC3986].  Note that the
   definition of "URI" excludes relative references.

   When an Atom document is relocated, migrated, syndicated,
   republished, exported or imported, the content of its Identity
   construct MUST NOT change.  Put another way, an Identity construct



Nottingham & Sayre       Expires July 27, 2005                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                   January 2005


   pertains to all instantiations of a particular Atom entry or feed;
   revisions retain the same content in their Identity constructs.


   atomIdentityConstruct =
      atomCommonAttributes,
      (atomUri)


3.5.1  Dereferencing Identity Constructs

   The content of an Identity construct MAY be dereferencable (e.g.  an
   HTTP URI).  However, processors MUST NOT assume it to be
   dereferencable.

   The content of an Identity construct MUST be created in a way that
   assures uniqueness, and it is suggested that the Identity construct
   be stored along with the associated resource.

   Because of the risk of confusion between URIs that would be
   equivalent if dereferenced, the following normalization strategy is
   strongly encouraged when generating Identity constructs:

   o  Provide the scheme in lowercase characters.
   o  Provide the host, if any, in lowercase characters.
   o  Only perform percent-encoding where it is essential.
   o  Use uppercase A-through-F characters when percent-encoding.
   o  Prevent dot-segments appearing in paths.
   o  For schemes that define a default authority, use an empty
      authority if the default is desired.
   o  For schemes that define an empty path to be equivalent to a path
      of "/", use "/".
   o  For schemes that define a port, use an empty port if the default
      is desired.
   o  Preserve empty fragment identifiers and queries.
   o  Ensure that all portions of the URI are UTF-8 encoded NFC form
      Unicode strings.

3.5.2  Comparing Identity Constructs

   Instances of Identity constructs can be compared to determine whether
   an entry or feed is the same as one seen before.  Processors MUST
   compare Identity constructs on a character-by-character basis in a
   case-sensitive fashion.

   As a result, two URIs that resolve to the same resource but are not
   character-for-character identical will be considered different for
   the purposes of Identifier comparison.

   For example, "http://www.example.org/thing",
   "http://www.example.org/Thing", "http://www.EXAMPLE.org/thing" and
   "HTTP://www.example.org/thing" will all be considered different
   identifiers, despite their differences in case.

   Likewise, "http://www.example.com/~bob",
   "http://www.example.com/%7ebob" and "http://www.example.com/%7Ebob"
   will all be considered different identifiers, because URI %-escaping
   is significant for the purposes of comparison.

4.  Element Definitions

4.1  The "atom:feed" Element

   The "atom:feed" element is the document (i.e., top-level) element of
   an Atom Feed Document, acting as a container for metadata and data
   associated with the feed.  Its first element child MUST be atom:head,
   which MAY be followed zero or more atom:entry child elements.


   atomFeed =
      element atom:feed {
         atomCommonAttributes,
         atomVersionAttribute,
         (atomHead
          & atomEntry*
          & anyElement*)
      }


4.1.1  The "version" Attribute

   atom:feed elements MUST have a "version" attribute whose content
   indicates the version of the Atom specification that the feed
   conforms to.  The content of this attribute is unstructured text.

   The version identifier for this specification is
   "draft-ietf-atompub-format-05: do not deploy".


   atomVersionAttribute =
    attribute version {"draft-ietf-atompub-format-05 : do not deploy"}


4.2  The "atom:head" Element

   The atom:head element acts as a container for metadata about the feed
   itself.

   The atom:head element MAY contain any namespace-qualified
   [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] elements as children.  This
   specification assigns no significance to the order of appearance of
   the child elements of atom:head.

          & anyElement*)
      }

   The following child elements are defined by this specification (note
   that the presence of some of these elements is required):

   o  atom:head elements MUST contain exactly one atom:title element.
   o  atom:head elements MUST contain at least one atom:link element
      with a rel attribute value of "alternate".
   o  atom:head elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:link
      element with a rel attribute value of "alternate" that has the
      same type attribute value.  If a feed's atom:link element with
      type="alternate" resolves to an HTML document, then that document
      SHOULD have a autodiscovery link element [Atom-autodiscovery] that
      reflects back to the feed.  atom:head elements MAY contain
      additional atom:link elements beyond those described above.
   o  atom:head elements MUST contain exactly one atom:author element,
      UNLESS all of the atom:feed element's child atom:entry elements
      contain an atom:author element.  atom:head elements MUST NOT
      contain more than one atom:author element.  [[inheritance]]
   o  atom:head elements MUST NOT contain more than one an
      atom:contributor element.
   o  atom:head elements MUST NOT contain more than one an
      atom:copyright element.
   o  atom:head elements MUST NOT contain more than one an atom:id
      element.
   o  atom:head elements MUST contain exactly one atom:updated element.
   o  atom:head elements MAY contain any number of atom:category
      elements.
   o  atom:head elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:post
      element.

   o  atom:head elements MUST NOT contain more than one
      atom:introspection element.
   o  atom:head elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:tagline
      element.
   o  atom:head elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:generator
      element.
   o  atom:head elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:info
      element.

4.2.1  Usage of "atom:head" within "atom:entry"

   In this case, the atom:head element acts as a container for metadata
   about the feed within which the entry was created.

   If an atom:entry is copied into one feed from another feed, then the
   atom:head element of the source feed SHOULD be inserted into the
   atom:entry unless the entry, as copied, already contains an atom:head
   element.  If the atom:entry already contains an atom:head, then that
   atom:head SHOULD be copied without modification.

   [[ ...  example ...  ]]

4.3  The "atom:entry" Element

   The "atom:entry" element represents an individual entry.  This
   element can appear as a child of the atom:feed element, or it can
   appear as the document (i.e., top-level) element of a standalone Atom
   Entry Document.

   When appearing in an Atom Entry Document, atom:entry elements MUST
   have a "version" attribute whose content indicates the version of the
   Atom specification that the entry conforms to.

   The version identifier for this specification is
   "draft-ietf-atompub-format-05: do not deploy".

   The atom:entry element MAY contain any namespace-qualified
   [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] elements as children.  This
   specification assigns no significance to the order of appearance of
   the child elements of atom:entry.

   o  atom:entry elements MUST contain an atom:summary element in any of
      the following cases:
      *  the atom:entry element contains no atom:content element.
      *  the atom:entry contains an atom:content which has a "src"
         attribute (and is thus empty).
      *  the atom:entry contains content which is encoded in Base64;
         i.e.  the "type" attribute of atom:content is a MIME media type
         [RFC2045] and does not begin with "text/" nor end with "+xml".
   o  atom:entry elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:summary
      element.
   o  atom:entry elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:edit
      element.
   o  atom:entry elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:head
      element.

4.4  The "atom:title" Element

   The "atom:title" element is a Text construct that conveys a
   human-readable title for an entry or feed.


   atomTitle = element atom:title { atomTextConstruct }


4.5  The "atom:id" Element

   The "atom:id" element is an Identity construct that conveys a
   permanent, universally unique identifier for an entry or feed.


   atomId = element atom:id { atomIdentityConstruct }


4.6  The "atom:link" Element

   The atom:link element is an empty element that defines a reference
   from an Atom Document to a Web resource.


   atomLink = element atom:link {
      atomCommonAttributes,
      attribute href { atomUri },
      attribute rel { atomNCName | atomUri }?,
      attribute type { atomMediaType }?,

   }


4.6.1  The "href" Attribute

   The "href" attribute contains the link's URI.  Link constructs MUST
   have a href attribute, whose value MUST be a URI reference [RFC3986].

   xml:base [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627] processing MUST be applied to the
   href attribute's content.

4.6.2  The "rel" Attribute

   Link elements MAY have an "rel" attribute that indicates the link
   relation type.  If the "rel" attribute is not present, the link
   element MUST be interpreted as if the link relation type is
   "alternate".


   rel_attribute = segment-nz-nc / URI

   The value of "rel" MUST be either a name, which is non-empty and does
   not contain any colon (":") characters, or a URI [RFC3986].  Note
   that use of a relative reference is not allowed.  If a name is given,
   implementations MUST consider the link relation type to be equivalent
   to the same name registered within the IANA Registry of Link
   Relations Section 9, and thus the URI that would be obtained by
   appending the value of the rel attribute to the string
   "http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/".  The value of "rel"
   describes the meaning of the link, but does not impose any behavioral
   requirements on implementations.

   This document defines two initial values for the Registry of Link
   Relations:

   The value "alternate" signifies that the URI in the value of the href
   attribute identifies an alternate version of the resource described
   by the containing element.

   The value "related" signifies that the URI in the value of the href
   attribute identifies a resource related to the resource described by
   the containing atom:feed or atom:entry element.  For example, the
   feed for a site which discusses the performance of the search engine
   at "http://search.example.com" might contain, as a child of
   atom:head:

   <link rel="related" href="http://search.example.com/">

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                   January 2005


   An identical link might appear as a child of any atom:entry whose
   content contains a discussion of that same search engine.

4.6.3  The "type" Attribute

   Link elements MAY have a type attribute, whose value MUST conform to
   the syntax of a MIME media type [RFC2045].

   The type attribute's value is an advisory media type; it is a hint
   about the type of the representation which is expected to be returned
   when the value of the href attribute is dereferenced.  Note that the
   type attribute does not override the actual media type returned with
   the representation.

4.6.4  The "hreflang" Attribute

   The "hreflang" attribute's content describes the language of the
   resource pointed to by the href attribute.  When used together with
   the rel="alternate", it implies a translated version of the entry.
   Link elements MAY have an hreflang attribute, whose value MUST be a
   language tag [RFC3066].

4.6.5  The "title" Attribute

   The "title" attribute conveys human-readable information about the
   link.  Link elements MAY have a title attribute.

4.6.6  The "length" Attribute

   The "length" attribute indicates an advisory length of the linked
   content in octets; it is a hint about the content length of the
   representation returned when the URI in the href attribute is
   dereferenced.  Note that the length attribute does not override the
   actual content length of the representation as reported by the
   underlying protocol.

   Link elements MAY have a length attribute.

4.7  The "atom:updated" Element

   The "atom:updated" element is a Date construct indicating the most
   recent instant in time when an entry or feed was modified in a way
   the producer considers significant.  Therefore, not all modifications
   necessarily result in a changed atom:updated value.

   Publishers MAY change the value of this element over time.
   Processors MAY present entries sorted using this value.  Processors
   MAY choose not to present entries until the instant in time specified

   in the atom:updated element has passed.


   atomUpdated = element atom:updated { atomDateConstruct }


4.8  The "atom:published" Element

   The "atom:published" element is a Date construct indicating an
   instant in time associated with an event early in the life cycle of
   the entry.  Typically, atom:published will be associated with the
   initial creation or first availability of the resource.

   Processors MAY present entries sorted using this value.  Processors
   MAY choose not to present entries until the instant in time specified
   in the atom:published element has passed.

4.9  The "atom:author" Element

   The "atom:author" element is a Person construct that indicates the
   default author of the an entry or feed


   atomAuthor = element atom:author { atomPersonConstruct }


4.10  The "atom:contributor" Element

   The "atom:contributor" element is a Person construct that indicates a
   person or other entity who contributes to the entry.


   atomContributor = element atom:contributor { atomPersonConstruct }


4.11  The "atom:host" Element

   The "atom:host" element's content conveys a domain name or network
   address associated with an entry's origin.  Its content MUST be a
   domain name [RFC1035], a dotted-decimal IPv4 address [RFC0791], or a
   colon-delimited IPv6 address [RFC2460].

4.12  The "atom:copyright" Element

   The "atom:copyright" element is a Text construct that conveys a
   human-readable copyright statement for an entry or feed.

   The atom:copyright element SHOULD NOT be used to convey

   machine-readable licensing information.

   If an atom:entry element does not contain an atom:copyright element,
   then the atom:copyright element of the containing atom:feed element's
   atom:head element, if present, should be considered to apply to the
   entry.

4.13  The "atom:category" Element

   Category elements contain information about a category to which an
   Atom feed or entry is associated.


   atomCategory = element atom:category {
      atomCommonAttributes,
      attribute term { text },
      attribute scheme { atomUri }?,
      attribute label { text }?,
      empty
   }


4.13.1  The "term" Attribute

   The "term" attribute is a string which identifies the category to
   which the entry or feed belongs.  Category elements MUST have a
   "term" attribute.

4.13.2  The "scheme" Attribute

   The "scheme"  attribute is a URI  that identifies a categorization
   scheme.  Category elements MAY have a "scheme" attribute.

4.13.3  The "label" attribute

   The "label" attribute provides a human-readable label that may be
   displayed in end-user applications.  Category elements MAY have a
   "label" attribute.

4.14  The "atom:summary" Element

   The "atom:summary" element is a Text construct that conveys a short
   summary, abstract or excerpt of an entry.


   atomSummary = element atom:summary { atomTextConstruct }

4.15  The "atom:content" Element

   The "atom:content" element either contains or links to the content of
   the entry.  atom:entry elements MUST contain zero or one atom:content
   elements.


   atomInlineTextContent =
      element atom:content {
         atomCommonAttributes,

         empty
      }

   atomContent = atomInlineTextContent
    | atomInlineXHTMLContent
    | atomOutOfLineContent


4.15.1  The "type" attribute

   atom:content MAY have a "type" attribute, When present, the value MAY
   be one of "TEXT", "HTML", or "XHTML".  Failing that, it MUST be a
   MIME media type [RFC2045] in which, to use the terminology of Section
   5 of [RFC2045], the top level is a discrete type.  If the type
   attribute is not provided, software MUST behave as though it were
   present with a value of "TEXT".

4.15.2  The "src" attribute

   atom:content MAY have a "src" attribute, whose value MUST be a URI
   reference [RFC3986].  If the "src" attribute is present, software MAY
   use the URI to retrieve the content.  If the "src" attribute is

   present, atom:content MUST be empty.  That is to say, the content may
   be retrievable using "src=" URI, or it may be contained within
   atom:content, but not both.

   If the "src" attribute is present, the "type" attribute SHOULD be
   provided and MUST be a MIME media type [RFC2045], rather than "TEXT",
   "HTML", or "XHTML".  The value is advisory; that is to say, upon
   dereferencing the URI to retrieve the content, if the server
   providing that content also provides a media type, the
   server-provided media type is authoritative.

   If the value of type begins with "text/" or ends with "+xml", the
   content SHOULD be local; that is to say, no "src" attribute should be
   provided.

4.15.3  Processing Model

   Software MUST apply the following rules in the order below to
   ascertain the rules governing the content of "atom:content".

   1.  If the value is "TEXT", the content of atom:content MUST NOT
       contain child elements.  Such text is intended to be presented to
       humans in a readable fashion.  Thus, software MAY display it
       using normal text rendering techniques such as proportional
       fonts, white-space collapsing, and justification.
   2.  If the value of "type" is "HTML", the content of atom:content
       MUST NOT contain child elements, and SHOULD be suitable for
       handling by software that knows HTML.  The HTML markup must be
       escaped; for example, "<br>" as "&lt;br>".  The HTML markup
       SHOULD be such that it could validly appear directly within an
       HTML <DIV> element.  Receiving software which displays the
       content SHOULD use the markup to aid in displaying it.
   3.  If the value of "type" is "XHTML", the content of atom:content
       MAY contain child elements.  The content SHOULD be XHTML text and
       markup that could validly appear directly within an xhtml:div
       element.  Receiving software which displays the content SHOULD
       use the markup to aid in displaying it.  Escaped markup is
       interpreted as a text representation of markup, and MUST NOT be
       interpreted as markup itself.
   4.  If the value of "type" ends with "+xml" or "/xml", the content of
       atom:content may include child elements, and SHOULD be suitable
       for handling by software that knows the indicated media type.  If
       the "src" attribute is not provided, this would normally mean
       that the "atom:content" element would contain a single child
       element which would serve as the root element of the XML document
       of the indicated type.
   5.  If the value of "type" begins with "text/" the content of
       atom:content MUST NOT contain child elements.

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                   January 2005


   6.  For all other values of "type", the content of atom:content MUST
       be a valid Base64 encoding [RFC3548], which when decoded SHOULD
       be suitable for handling by software that knows the indicated
       media type.  In this case, the characters in the Base64 encoding
       may be preceded and followed in the atom:content element by
       whitespace, and lines are separated by a single newline (U+000A)
       character.

4.16  The "atom:introspection" Element

   The "atom:introspection" element is a Service construct that conveys
   the URI of an introspection file associated with a feed.


   atomIntrospection =
             element atom:introspection { atomServiceConstruct }


4.17  The "atom:post" Element

   The "atom:post" element is a Service construct that conveys the URI
   used to add entries to a feed.


   atomPost = element atom:post { atomServiceConstruct }


4.18  The "atom:edit" Element

   The "atom:edit" element is a Service construct that conveys the URI
   used to retrieve and edit the source representation of an entry.


   atomEdit = element atom:edit { atomServiceConstruct }


4.19  The "atom:tagline" Element

   The "atom:tagline" element is a Text construct that conveys a
   human-readable description or tagline for the feed.


   atomTagline = element atom:tagline { atomTextConstruct }


4.20  The "atom:generator" Element

   The "atom:generator" element's content identifies the software agent

   used to generate a feed, for debugging and other purposes.


   atomGenerator = element atom:generator {
      atomCommonAttributes,
      attribute url { atomUri }?,
      attribute version { text }?,
      text
   }

   The content of this element, when present, MUST be a string that is a
   human-readable name for the generating agent.

   The atom:generator element MAY have a "uri" attribute whose value
   MUST be a URI reference [RFC3986].  When dereferenced, that URI
   SHOULD produce a representation that is relevant to that agent.

   The atom:generator element MAY have a "version" attribute that
   indicates the version of the generating agent.  When present, its
   value is unstructured text.

4.21  The "atom:info" Element

   The "atom:info" element is a Text construct that conveys a
   human-readable explanation of the feed format itself.  The atom:info
   element SHOULD NOT be considered meaningful by processors; it is a
   convenience to publishers.


   atomInfo = element atom:info { atomTextConstruct }

6.  Securing Atom Documents

   Because Atom is an XML-based format, existing XML security mechanisms
   can be used to secure its content.

6.1  Digital Signatures

   The document element of an Atom document (i.e., atom:feed in an Atom
   Feed Document, atom:entry in an Atom Entry Document) MAY have an
   Enveloped Signature, as described by XML-Signature and Syntax
   Processing [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20020212].

   Processors MUST NOT reject an Atom document containing such a
   signature because they are not capable of verifying it; they MUST
   continue processing and MAY inform the user of their failure to
   validate the signature.

   In other words, the presence of an element with the namespace URI
   "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#" and a local name of "Signature"
   as a child of the document element must not cause a processor to fail
   merely because of its presence.

   Other elements in an Atom document MUST NOT be signed unless their
   definitions explicitly specify such a capability.

6.2  Encryption

   The document element of an Atom document (i.e., atom:feed in an Atom
   Feed Document, atom:entry in an Atom Entry Document) MAY be
   encrypted, using the mechanisms described by XML Encryption Syntax
   and Processing [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210].

9.  IANA Considerations

   An Atom Document, when serialized as XML 1.0, can be identified with
   the following media type:

   MIME media type name: application
   MIME subtype name: atom+xml
   Mandatory parameters: None.
   Optional parameters:
      "charset": This parameter has identical semantics to the charset
         parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified in
         RFC 3023 [RFC3023].  [RFC3023].
   Encoding considerations: Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in RFC 3023 [RFC3023], section 3.2.
   Security considerations: As defined in this specification.  [[update
      upon publication]]
      In addition, as this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it
      shares the same security considerations as described in RFC 3023
      [RFC3023], section 10.
   Interoperability considerations: There are no known interoperability
      issues.
   Published specification: This specification.  [[update upon
      publication]]
   Applications which use this media type: No known applications
      currently use this media type.

   Additional information:

   Magic number(s): As specified for "application/xml" in RFC 3023
      [RFC3023], section 3.2.
   File extension: .atom
   Fragment identifiers: As specified for "application/xml" in RFC 3023
      [RFC3023], section 5.
   Base URI: As specified in RFC 3023 [RFC3023], section 6.
   Macintosh File Type code: TEXT
   Person and email address to contact for further information: Mark
      Nottingham <mnot@pobox.com>
   Intended usage: COMMON
   Author/Change controller: This specification's author(s).  [[update
      upon publication]]

9.1  Registry of Link Relations

   This registry is maintained by IANA and initially contains the two
   values: "alternate" and "related".  New assignments are subject to
   IESG Approval, as outlined in [RFC2434].  Requests should be made by
   email to IANA, which will then forward the request to the IESG
   requesting approval.  The request should contain discussion of at

   o  A value for the "rel" attribute that conforms to the syntax rule
      given in Section 4.6.2
   o  Common name for link type.
   o  Description of link type semantics.
   o  Expected display characteristics.

   Atom document can be encrypted and signed using
   [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210] and [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20020212],
   respectively, and is subject to the security considerations implied
