       Receive-Only Service Function and External Service in SFC
                     draft-wang-sfc-receive-only-02

Abstract

   A category of services such as Intrusion Detection Service and Packet
   Capture operates in "receive-only" mode.  They are "packet sinks"
   which consume all packets sent to them.  This document describes the
   proposals for such service to be part of the Service Function
   Chaining framework.

1.  Introduction

   Services in Service Function Chaining (SFC) usually operate in
   "inline" mode, where they process the received packets and return the
   packets to the Service Function Forwarder (SFF).  Some services
   especially in the network security domain can buffer, inject or block
   certain packets, as well as proxy entire connections
   ([I-D.wang-sfc-ns-use-cases]).  However, in general they still
   forward packets.

   [I-D.wang-sfc-ns-use-cases] also describes a special set of services
   that consume all packets sent to them.  We refer to such behavior as
   "receive-only".  A receive-only service could be a Service Function
   (SF) participating in SFC ([RFC7665]), or it could be an External
   Service (ES) receiving packets from the SFF or another regular SF.
   This document describes proposals for designing SFC packet plane and
   control plane to incorporate receive-only services.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Definition Of Terms

   This document uses the terms as defined in [RFC7498], [RFC7665] and
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh].

   In addition the following terms are defined.

   Receive-Only (RO):  A service operational mode where the service does
       not forward on packets that it receives.  It is often known as
       "packet sink" as well.

   RO SF:  A Receive-Only Service Function participating in SFC as
       defined in [RFC7665], except that the SF operates in Receive-Only
       mode.

   RO ES:  A Receive-Only External Service not participating in SFC.
       Specifically, an RO ES is not an SF.  It is not allocated with a
       Service Index (SI) in the Service Function Path (SFP).  However,
       it receives packets from the SFF or an SF.

   Extended SFC Proxy:  An SFC Proxy ([RFC7665]) with extended
       capability to support Receive-Only SF.  The SFC Proxy replicates
       and sends packets to the RO SF.  The SFC encapsulation may be
       preserved if the RO SF is SFC aware.  The Proxy forwards the
       original packets back to the SFF in the same way as a regular SF
       (e.g., with Service Index (SI) decremented in NSH).

   Flow:  A unidirectional traffic stream identified by network layer
       attributes, specifically IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports for TCP/
       UDP traffic.

   Connection:  A bidirectional traffic stream composed of two flows
       sharing the same network layer attributes.

3.  Receive-Only Service Function vs. External Service

   A receive-only service may be a Service Function (SF) or External
   Service (ES) depending on whether the SFC administrator designs the
   service to be part of the SFC or not.

   In the following example, the IDS service is located between "DDoS
   Mitigator" and "Firewall" as part of an integrated security solution

   to protect the server (S).  Packets from the client (C) must be
   examined by a chain of services before they reach the server.  The
   three service functions, DDoS, IDS and Firewall, compose an SFC.
   Each SF including the IDS SF is allocated with a Service Index (SI)
   in the SFP.  The IDS SF is a fundamental part of the service chain
   with the only exception that it does not egress packets.  We refer to
   the IDS service as a Receive-Only SF (RO SF).

   There are other attributes for an RO SF.  There is a limited number
   of location options for "IDS" to be deployed in an SFC.  Once
   deployed, the location of "IDS" does not change usually unless the
   SFs are added to or removed from the SFC.

   Extending the SFC framework to RO SF enables a common SFC policy
   model for SFC administrators.  The administrator only needs to manage
   one set of policy that covers both RO and regular SFs, no matter how
   they handle packets.

   "Packet Capture" for troubleshooting represents the other type of
   receive-only services that do not participate in SFC.

   The administrator may insert "Packet Capture" at any stage of an SFP.
   Packets may be captured before and/or after one or multiple SFs,
   which means there are many possible invocation points for "Packet
   Capture" in an SFP.  The administrator may want to dynamically insert
   or remove "Packet Capture" based on the need for troubleshooting and
   threat analysis.  When doing so, it is desired that the construction
   of the SFP is not affected.  That is, the Service Path ID (SPID) and
   Service Index (SI) for each of the SFs in the SFP remain unchanged.

   Services with the above attributes receive SFC packets but are not
   listed in an SFC.  They do not consume an SI in the SFP.  We refer to
   such a service as a Receive-Only External Service (RO ES).

   An RO ES still requires support from SFC elements including SFF and
   SF for receiving packets.  Because an RO ES does not send back
   packets, it must receive replication of the packets.  Depending on
   the use cases and performance requirements, an SFF or SF may perform
   the packet replication for the RO ES.  For example, a Packet Capture
   for troubleshooting purpose may tap on the SFF at one or more
   locations along the SFP (Figure 2).

   This document describes the necessary enhancements to the SFC
   framework for supporting RO ES.

4.  SFC Packet Plane

4.1.  Receive-Only Service Function

   A Receive-Only SF behaves the same way as a regular SF except that it
   does not forward packets.  As a result, it must receive a copy of the
   packets while the original packets travel through the rest of the SFs
   in the SFP.  Because an RO SF occupies an SI in the SFP, the SI of
   the original packet must be decremented after the packet passes the
   RO SF.

   Considering the fact that an RO SF does not forward packets and SFF
   is not designed to decrement SI, an Extended SFC Proxy is leveraged
   to perform the packet replication and SI decrement tasks on behalf of
   the RO SF.  As shown in the Figure below, the Extended SFC Proxy
   makes a copy of the packet including the NSH and sends the copy to
   the RO SF-2.  It decrements the SI of original packet and forwards
   that packet back to the SFF.  This capability is an extension to the
   current SFC Proxy as defined in ([RFC7665]).

   From the SFF's perspective, the combination of the Extended SFC Proxy
   and the RO SF behaves as a regular SF that processes and forwards
   packets with SI decremented.  From the RO SF's perspective, the
   Extended SFC Proxy may be a logical component in the specific SFF
   implementation for efficiency.

    Figure 3: Packet Replication and SI Decrement by Extended SFC Proxy
                                 for RO SF

   A packet goes through the following steps in the above example:

   1.  SFF receives the packet from SF-1 with SPID=10 and SI=254

   2.  SFF looks up in its forwarding table and finds Extended SFC Proxy
       for SF-2 to be the next hop.  SFF sends the packet to SF-2's
       Proxy.

   3.  Extended SFC Proxy replicates the packet and sends the copy to
       SF-2 which is an RO SF.  The copy has SI=254

Internet-Draft              SFC Receive-only                   June 2017


   4.  Extended SFC Proxy decrements the SI of the original packet and
       sends the packet back to SFF.  The packet now has SI=253

   5.  SFF looks up the next service function, SF-3, in its forwarding
       table based on the SPID and SI from Extended SFC Proxy.  SFF
       sends the packet to SF-3.

4.2.  Receive-Only External Service

   A Receive-Only External Service still receives a copy of the packets
   designated to it even if it is not listed in the SFP.

   For some use cases such as capturing a file content for sandbox
   analysis, packet data replication may be conducted by an SF capable
   of identifying file boundary in the packet stream.  The RO ES would
   be associated with the SF and receives packet data from the SF
   directly.

   Alternatively, for use cases such as generic packet capture for
   troubleshooting, the SFF may carry out the packet replication and
   forwarding work.  Higher performance may be achieved with hardware
   based SFF.

              Figure 4: Packet replication options for RO ES

   When an RO ES receives packets from the SFF, it may be attached to
   the SFF at multiple locations along the SFP.  The location may be
   indicated by a (SPID, SI) pair and programmed into the SFF's
   forwarding table.

   The SFF performs packet replication when the packet needs to be sent
   to the RO ES (SFC Proxy cannot be used because RO ES is not an SF).
   The SI of the original packet MUST NOT be affected by the fact that a
   copy is being sent to the RO ES.  The following figure illustrates an
   example with SFF performing packet replication.

               Figure 5: Packet Replication by SFF for RO ES

   Here is a sample packet flow involving an Receive-Only External
   Service:

   1.  SFF receives the packet from SF-1 with SPID=10 and SI=254

   2.  SFF looks up the next service function, SF-2, in its forwarding
       table.  The forwarding entry also indicates an RO ES at this
       location.  SFF replicates the packet and sends a copy of the
       packet including NSH to ES-1.  The original packet is not
       changed.

   3.  SFF sends the original packet to SF-2.

5.  SFC Control Plane

5.1.  Receive-Only Service Function

   An RO SF such as IDS is specified the same way as a regular SF in the
   SFC Classification Policy.  For example, the SFC in Figure 1 contains
   the following SFs:

   SFC - DDoS : [IDS] : Firewall

   When the SFC is converted to an SFP, the combination of Extended SFC
   Proxy and the IDS RO SF presents as a regular SF in the SFP as
   depicted in Figure 3.  The SFP comprises of the following:

   SFP - DDoS : SFC Proxy for [IDS] : Firewall

   The SFC Control Plane also provisions the Extended SFC Proxy to send
   the replicated packet to the [IDS] SF.  The provisioning message is
   outside the scope of this document.

5.2.  Receive-Only External Service

   An RO ES is not provisioned by SFC Classification Policy.
   Implementation may choose to use a dedicated policy for an RO ES such
   as "Packet Capture Policy".

   The policy for RO ES may be configured into a regular SF when the SF
   performs replication for the RO ES.

   In the scenario where SFF performs packet replication, the RO ES
   policy may be evaluated by the SFC Control Plane.  The SFC Control
   Plane programs the replication locations into the SFF, as indicated
   by (SPID, SI) pairs.  Figure 6 below illustrates a control plane flow
   for setting packet replication in the SFF for an RO ES.

           Figure 6: Control flow for SFF replication for RO ES

   1.  SFC Control Plane evaluates the RO ES policy and determines the
       location(s) for SFF to perform packet replication and send
       packets to RO ES.

   2.  SFC Control Plane uses C2 Control Plane-SFF interface
       ([I-D.ietf-sfc-control-plane]) to update the SFF forwarding table
       with replication entries to RO ES.

6.  SFC Element Considerations

6.1.  Receive-Only Service Function

   An RO SF MUST NOT send received packets back to the Extended SFC
   Proxy.

Internet-Draft              SFC Receive-only                   June 2017


6.2.  Extended SFC Proxy

   The Extended SFC Proxy for an RO SF carries the following additional
   capabilities compared with a regular SFC Proxy:

   1.  Packet replication

   2.  Preserving the SFC encapsulation in the copy of the packet when
       the RO SF is SFC aware

   The Extended SFC Proxy MUST discard any packets from the RO SF to
   prevent duplicated packets to the SFF.  When preserved, the NSH SPID/
   SI in the packet copy sent to RO SF MUST not change.  The NSH SI in
   the original packet forwarded back to the SFF MUST be decremented.

6.3.  Receive-Only External Service

   An RO ES should have proper transport with the data source, either
   the SF or SFF.  If it receives replicated packets from the SFF, the
   RO ES should comply with the transport as specified for the SFC,
   similar to that between a regular SF and the SFF.

   An RO ES MUST NOT send received packets back to the data source.

6.4.  Service Function Forwarder

6.4.1.  Receive-Only Service Function

   There is not any special requirement for the SFF to support an RO SF.
   The Extended SFC Proxy performs packet replication and other regular
   SF tasks on behalf of the RO SF.

6.4.2.  Receive-Only External Service

   The following figure illustrates a sample SFF forwarding table when
   the SFF carries out the packet replication task for RO ES.  The
   "copy" column in the forwarding table is used to decide whether a
   copy or the original packet should be sent to the next hop (SF or
   ES).  Entries for the RO ES have the "copy" field set.

6.4.3.  SFF Capabilities Considerations

   In order to support RO ES, implementation of an SFF SHOULD support
   the following capabilities:

   1.  Packer replication

   2.  Discarding any packets returned by an RO ES

   Additional capabilities for receive-only support include the
   following:

   1.  Replicating a portion of the packet (e.g. headers only)

   2.  Filtering selected packets to be replicated to receive-only
       service

   3.  Sending collective statistics in place of raw packet data

   4.  Producing Netflow/IPFIX and other events

   Those capabilities are beyond the scope of this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   Even if an RO SF is required not to send packets back to the Extended
   SFC Proxy, the implementation of Extended SFC Proxy SHOULD handle
   packets from an RO SF gracefully without causing exceptions or
   duplicated packets in the SFP.
