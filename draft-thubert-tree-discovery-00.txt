1. Introduction

   As per Nemo Basic support, a Mobile Router autoconfigures a single
   Care of Address to register to its Home Agent and terminate its MR-HA
   tunnel. That CoA is the MR's point of attachment to the nested Nemo.

   Consequently, if loops are avoided, the nested Nemo assumes the shape
   of a tree. The nodes of the tree are Mobile Routers, the root is
   either a fixed or a Mobile Router, called in the latter case the root
   Mobile Router in NEMO terminology [6]. The leaves are mobile or fixed
   hosts, called Local Fixed Nodes, Local Mobile Nodes and Visiting
   Mobile Nodes in the NEMO terminology.

   This paper provides (1) a minimum extension to IPv6 Neighbour
   Discovery Router Advertisements in order to ensure that Mobile
   Routers attaching to one another actually avoid loops and end up
   forming a tree, and (2) the minimum common part of all MR algorithms
   that is required to ensure that whatever their specific decisions,
   loops between MRs will be avoided.

   The method is based on an autonomous decision by each MR with no
   global state convergence such as a MANET proactive routing protocol.
   In fact, MRs may make different decisions from a same input, based on
   their own configuration and their own algorithms.

   In order to build trees of Mobile Routers, we propose an extension to
   the ICMP Router Advertisement (RA) message, the Tree Information
   Option (TIO). The RA/TIO allows MRs to advertise the tree they belong
   to, and to select and move to the best location within the available
   trees. MRs propagate the TIO down the tree, updating some metrics
   such as the tree depth, leaving alone root information such as the
   tree identifier, and sending the result in RAs over the ingress
   interfaces.

2. Terms and Abbreviations

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with Mobile IPv6 as
   defined in [3] and with the concept of Mobile Router defined in the
   Nemo terminology document [6].

   For the needs of this paper, the following new definitions are
   introduced:

   Nemo Clusterhead: The root of a tree of mobile routers. When the tree
      of Mobile Routers is attached to the infrastructure, the fixed
      Access Router may act as cluster head if it supports the Tree
      Information Option described in this document. If it does not,
      then the Clusterhead coincides with the root MR in NEMO

      terminology. A clusterhead is elected even when the tree is not
      attached to the infrastructuture. A stand-alone MR is a
      Clusterhead.

   Floating Tree: A Nested Nemo which Clusterhead is a MR that is not
      attached to an AR.

   Grounded Tree: A Nested Nemo whose Clusterhead is attached to the
      infrastructure. In other words, the clusterhead is either a fixed
      router that supports RA/TIO or is a MR which attachment router is
      a fixed router that does not support RA/TIO.

   Mobile Access Router: A Mobile Router that provides Access Router
      services to other MRs.

   Attachment Router: The Router that is selected as Access Router by a
      Mobile Router, making it its parent in the nested NEMO tree.

   Propagation: The action by a Mobile Router that consists in receiving
      a RA/TIO from its Attachment Router, recomputing a few specific
      fields, removing unknown suboption, and appending the resulting
      TIO to RAs sent over the ingress interfaces.


3. Motivations

3.1 Multihomed nested mobile network

   A nested mobile network that is made of multiple MRs having a direct
   connection to the Internet is said to be multihomed. Multihoming in
   Nemo offers useful properties to MNNs. Reference [8] lists potential
   multihomed configurations for Nemo and explains the different
   problems and advantages that some configurations may introduce.
   Multihoming offers three main abilities to the Nemo: it allows route
   recovery on failure, redundancy and load-sharing between MRs (or
   between MRs'interfaces). However, for the moment there are no
   requirements nor protocol defining how to use several egress
   interfaces inside a Nemo.

   In a nested Nemo, the hierarchy of MRs increases the complexity of
   the route and/or router selection for MNNs. Each level of a Nemo
   implies the usage of a new tunnel between the MR and its home agent.
   Thus if a MNN connects to a sub-Nemo which is also a sub-Nemo,
   packets from the MNN will be encapsulated three times.

   When the Nemo where the MN is connected to is multihomed, the MN may
   have the choice between several AR to be its default router.
   Reference [9] introduces new options in Router Advertisement to allow



Thubert & Montavont     Expires octobre 30, 2004                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                     TD                           May 2004


   any node on a link to choose between several routers. This option
   mainly consists of a 2-bits flag that indicates the preference of the
   router (low, medium or high). Furthermore, the same flag can be set
   in the Route Information option indicating the preference of a
   specific prefix. Therefore, any node can determine its best default
   router(s) according to a given destination and its best router for
   default, which will be used by default.

   However this preference is only useful in a flat topology; It gives a
   way to the node to choose between different access routers
   advertising prefixes on the node link. But if the node is inside a
   hierarchical topology (some access routers are not at the same level)
   the node can not learn the level of each access router.

   One of the usage of the new option introduced in this document is to
   distribute information on the hierarchy of MRs. This information can
   be distributed to ARs, MRs and MNNs as well in order to allow better
   route selection and to increase the knowledge of the Nemo topology on
   each node.

3.2 Loops in nested Nemo

   When several MRs attach to each other to form a nested Nemo, loops
   can be created if they are not explicitely avoided. In the simplest
   case, when egress and ingress interfaces of an MR are all wireless, a
   mobile router may be listening to Router Advertisement from its own
   ingress interface, creating a confliction problem. In the general
   case, arbitrary attachment of MRs will form graphs that are not
   exempt of loops. For instance: Assume a nested Nemo where MR1 is
   connected to the infrastructure, and MR3 is attached to MR2. Say that
   MR2 can hear both MR3 and MR1 over its wireless egress interface. If
   MR2 select MR1, the connectivity to the infrastruture is provided for
   all. But if MR2 selects MR3, MR2 and MR3 end up forming a loop and
   are disconnected from their Home Agents.

   With Nemo basic support, a MR uses a single primary CareOf to attach
   to the nested structure. As a result, if loops are avoided, the
   nested NEMO end up forming a tree. It is beneficial to be able to
   form that tree in an optimum fashion for a given set of metrics such
   as tree depth.

   The shape of a nested Nemo may change rapidly due to MRs movement. It
   is thus impractical to expect each MR to be able to maintain states
   about the whole tree structure in a link state fashion. On the
   contrary, it is also beneficial to allow each MR to make its own
   independent selection based on a minimum information about its
   immediate neighbors, in order to reestablish the tree quickly upon
   erratic movements.



Thubert & Montavont     Expires octobre 30, 2004                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                     TD                           May 2004


   Each MR should be able to make its own attachment router selection
   based on its own condition (eg battery level), its own set of
   constraints that may not apply to other MRs in the tree, and in
   general its own algorithm. As a result, the standardization effort
   should concentrate on a common minimum set of rules that must be
   common to all MRs in order to prevent routing loops in the nested
   NEMO while leaving MRs independent in their AR selection algorithms.

4. Router Advertisement extensions

   New extensions of Router Advertisement are proposed to distribute the
   knowledge of the MR hierarchy inside a nested Nemo. These extensions
   are defined in different options/sub-options: a flag bit from the
   reserved flag field of Router Advertisement message is used to
   indicate whether the sending router is a MR or not; a new option is
   defined to transport minimum information on the tree to avoid loops
   generation;

4.1 Router Advertisement message

   We propose to use a reserved flag of the Router Advertisement message
   to inform whether the sending router is a MR or not.

4.2 Tree Information Option

   The following option regroups the minimum information that allows a
   MR to discover a tree and select its point of attachment while
   avoiding loop generation. It can also be used by MNNs to select their
   best default router. If the default router of a non-MR sends Router

   Type 8-bit unsigned integer set to 10 by the Clusterhead.

   Length 8-bit unsigned integer set to 4. The length of the option
      (including the type and length fields) in units of 8 octets.

   Grounded (G) The Grounded (G) flag is set when the Clusterhead is
      attached to a fixed network infrastructure (such as the Internet).

      its home network.

   Reserved 16-bit unsigned integer set to 0 by the Clusterhead.

   Preference The administrative preference of that (mobile) Access
      Router. Default is 0. 255 is the highest possible preference. Set
      by each MR at propagation time.

   BootTimeRandom A random value computed at boot time and recomputed in
      case of a duplication with another AR. The concatenation of the
      Preference and the BootTimeRandom is a 32-bit extended preference
      that is used to resolve collisions. It is set by each MR at
      propagation time.

   TreeDepth 8-bit unsigned integer. The tree depth of the clusterhead
      is 0 if it is a fixed router and 1 if it is a Mobile Router. The
      tree Depth of a tree Node is the depth of its attachment router as
      received in a TIO, incremented by one. All nodes in the tree
      advertise their tree depth in the Tree Information Options that
      they append to the RA messages over their ingress interfaces as
      part of the propagation process.

   TreePreference 8-bit unsigned integer set by the Clusterhead to its
      preference and unchanged at propagation. Default is 0 (lowest
      preference).

   TreeDelay 16-bit unsigned integer set by the Clusterhead indicating
      the delay before changing the tree configuration, in milliseconds.
      A default value is 128ms. It is expected to be an order of
      magnitude smaller than the RA-interval so if the clusterhead has a
      sub-second RA-interval, the Tree delay may be shorter than 100ms.
      It is also expected to be an order of magnitude longer than the
      typical propagation delay inside the nested Nemo.

   PathDigest 32-bit unsigned integer CRC, updated by each MR. This is
      the result of a CRC-32c computation on a bit string obtained by
      appending the received value and the MR Care of Address.
      Clusterheads use a 'previous value' of zeroes to initially set the
      PathDigest.

   TreeID 128-bit unsigned integer which uniquely identify a tree set by
      the Clusterhead. The global IPv6 home address of the Clusterhead
      can be used.


5. Tree Discovery

   Here follows a set of rules and definitions that MUST be followed be
   all Mobile Routers:

   1.  An MR that is not attached to an AR is the Nemo Clusterhead of
       its own, floating tree.

   2.  An MR that is attached to an AR that does not support TIO, is the
       clusterhead of its own, grounded tree.

Internet-Draft                     TD                           May 2004


   3.  A router sending a RA without TIO is considered a grounded AR at
       depth 0. Thus, a MR that attaches to an AR that does not include
       a TIO in its RA becomes a Clusterhead of depth 1.

   4.  The Nemo ClusterHead of a tree exposes the tree in the RA/TIO and
       MRs propagate the TIO down the tree with the RAs that they
       forward over their ingress links.

   5.  An MR that is already part of a tree MAY move at any time and
       with no delay in order to get closer to the clusterhead of its
       current tree - i.e. in order to reduce its own tree depth. But an
       MR MUST NOT move down the tree that it is attached to. MRs MUST
       ignore RAs that are received from other routers located deeper or
       at the same depth within the same tree.

   6.  An MR may move from its current tree into any different tree at
       any time and whatever the depth its reaches in the new tree, but
       it may have to wait for a Tree Hop timer to elapse in order to do
       so. The MR will join that other tree if it is more preferable for
       reasons of connectivity, configured preference, size, security,
       bandwidth, tree depth, or whatever metrics the MR cares to use.

   7.  If a MR has selected a new attachment router but has not moved
       yet (because it is waiting for Tree Hop timer to elapse), the MR
       is unstable and refrains from sending RATIOs.

   8.  When an MR joins a tree, moves within its tree, or when it
       receives a modified TIO from its current access router, the MR
       sends an unsolicited Router Advertisement message on all its
       mobile networks (i.e. all its ingress interfaces). The RA
       contains a TIO that propagates the new tree information. At the
       same time, the MR MAY send a Binding Update to its home agent or
       a local proxy of some sort, because the tree it is attached to
       has changed. If the MR fails to reach its HA, it MAY attempt to
       roll back the movement or to retry the HA discovery procedure.

   9.  This allows the new higher parts of the tree to take place first
       eventually dragging their sub-tree with them, and allowing
       stepped sub-tree reconfigurations, limiting relative movements.


5.1 tree selection

   The tree selection is implementation and algorithm dependent. In
   order to limit erratic movements, and all metrics being equal, MRs
   SHOULD stick to their previous selection. Also, MRs SHOULD provide a
   mean to filter out candidate ARs whose availability is detected as
   fluctuating, at least when more stable choices are available. For

   instance, the MR MAY place the failed AR in a Hold Down mode that
   ensures that the AR will not be reused for a given period of time.

   The known trees are associated with the AR that advertises them and
   kept in an ordered list, per order of preference, by extending the
   Default Router List. DRL entries are extended to store the
   information received from the last TIO, and a timer ID -and related
   data- to delay the reaction to a better RA message, the tree hop
   timer, as described in the next section.

   When connection to a fixed network is not possible or preferable for
   security or other reasons, scattered trees should aggregate as much
   as possible into larger trees in order to allow inner connectivity.
   How to balance these trees is implementation dependent, and MAY use a
   specific visitor-counter suboption in the TIO.

5.2 Tree Hop Timer

   The tree Hop timer serves 2 purposes:

      Delay the reattachment of a subtree that has been forced to
      detach. This allows to make sure that when a subtree has detached,
      the RATIO that is initiated by the new clusterhead has spread down
      the subtree so that two different trees have formed.

      Limit RA/TIO storms when two trees collide. The idea is that
      between the nodes from tree A that wish to move to tree B, those
      that see the highest place in tree B will move first and advertise
      their new locations before other nodes from tree A actually move.

   A new tree is discovered upon a router advertisement message with or
   without a RA/TIO. The MR joins the tree by selecting the source of
   the RA message as its access router (default gateway) and propagating
   the TIO accordingly.

   When a new tree is discovered, the candidate AR that advertises the
   new tree is placed in a held up state for the duration of a Tree Hop
   timer. If the new AR is more preferable than the current one, the MR
   expects to jump and becomes unstable.

   A MR that is unstable may discover other ARs from the same new tree
   during the instability phase. It needs to start a new Tree Hop timer
   for all these. The first timer that elapses for a given new tree
   clears them all for that tree, allowing the MR to jump to the highest
   position available in the new tree.

   The duration of the Tree Hop timer depends on the tree delay of the
   new tree and on the depth of AR that triggers it:

   (AR's depth + random) * AR's tree_delay (where 0 <= random < 1).  It
   is randomized in order to limit collisions and synchronizations.

5.3 Collisions and stability

   Attachment routers in the DRL may or may not be usable for roaming
   depending on runtime conditions. The following states are defined:

   Current This AR is used for roaming

   Candidate This AR can be used for roaming. Typically, an initial
      held-up period is over but the candidate is not preferred over the
      current AR.

   Held-Up This AR can not be used till tree hop timer elapses. This
      does not occur for a fixed AR that does not send a TIO since the
      tree delay is null in that case..

   Held-Down This AR can not be used till hold down timer elapses. At
      the end of the hold-down period, the router is removed from the
      DRL, and will be reinserted if it appears again with a RA.

   Collision This AR can not be used till its next Router Advertisement


5.3.1 Hold down

   When a router is 'removed' from the Default Router List, it is
   actually held down for a hold down timer period, in order to prevent
   flapping. This happens when an AR disappears (upon expiration timer),
   and when an AR is tried but can not reach the HA (upon expiration of
   another AR, or upon tree hop for that AR).

   An Attachment Router that is held down is not considered for the
   purpose of roaming. When the hold down timer elapses, the AR is
   removed from the DRL.

5.3.2 Instability

   A MR is instable when a Held-Up AR is placed before the current AR.
   Instability is transient (In the order of tree hop timers). When a MR
   is instable, it MUST NOT send RAs with TIO. This avoids loops when MR
   A wishes to attach to MR B and MR B wishes to attach to MR A. Unless
   RA cross (which is a short window of time), a MR receives TIO from
   stable ARs, which do not plan to attach to itself, so the MR can
   safely attach to them.

   A MR is instable when it is prepared to move shortly to another AR.

   This happens typically when it discovers a new and more preferred
   candidate AR, for the duration of the tree hop timer. During that
   time, the new candidate is placed in Held-up state. Instability may
   also occur when the current AR is lost and the next best is still
   held up.  Instability is resolved when the tree hop timer of all the
   AR (s) causing instability elapse. Such AR is changes state to
   Current or Held-Down.

5.3.3 Collision

   A race condition occurs if 2 MRs send RA/TIO at the same time and
   wish to join each other. In order to detect the situation, MRs time
   stamp the sending of RA/TIO. Any RA/TIO received within a short
   media-dependant period introduces a risk. To divide the risk, A
   32bits extended preference is added in the TIO. The first byte is the
   AR own preference (default 0), the rest is a boot time computed
   random.

   A MR that decides to join an AR will do so between (AR depth) and (AR
   depth + 1) times the AR tree delay. But since a MR is unstable as
   soon as it receives the RA/TIO from the preferred AR, it will
   restrain from sending a RA/TIO between the time it receives the RA
   and the time it actually jumps. So the crossing of RA may only happen
   during the propagation time between the AR and the MR, plus some
   internal queuing and processing time within each machine. It is
   expected that one tree delay normally covers that interval, but
   ultimately it is up to the implementation and the configuration of
   the AR to define the duration of risk window.

   There is risk of a collision when a MR receives an RA, for an other
   mobile router that is more preferable than the current AR, within the
   risk window. In the face of a potential collision, the Mobile Router
   with the lowest extended preference processes the RA/TIO normally,
   while the router with the highest preference places the other in
   collision state, does not start the tree hop timer, and does not
   become instable. It is expected that next RAs between the two will
   not cross anyway.
