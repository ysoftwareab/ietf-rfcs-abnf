Internet-Draft      Geo-Location information for RPKI          June 2011


2.  Introduction

   The existence of this object comes from a desire from a number of
   Internet networking entities to use geographical awareness in
   designing, operating, and maintaining networks.  These desires are
   briefly described here.  There are of course many other efforts
   external to the IETF and won't be described here.  Further awareness
   of these efforts is left to the reader.

   This document describes the construction, use, and interpretation of
   the RPKI-GEO record.  This record provides first class informational
   attestations pertaining to the geographical attributes relating to
   the Internet Number Resources (INRs) as published by the holder of
   the resources.  The use of the geographical data is of an
   informational nature and provides a consistent and validatable
   approach to asserting the location properties of allocated resources.
   To maintain consistency implementers and readers should consider the
   9 rules in section 3 of [RFC5491].

   The geographic attestations made in this object are made by the
   certificate maintainer and their validity and accuracy is in the
   hands of the certificate maintainer.  It is left to the relying party
   as how much trust is given to the geographic data provided by the
   certificate maintainer.

2.1.  Network Providers

   Customer focused network providers can use this object to
   categorically describe the geographical attributes of customer
   networks that will allow content providers (individually or via GEO
   IP services) to more accurately direct customer traffic.  The
   benefits of this can be more consistent service provision, or
   improved traffic flows in both latency and content models.

   Anycast operations [RFC4786] might also benefit from the provision of
   geographic information in this form.  Publishing a consistent
   awareness of the location of anycasted service nodes may help network
   operators improve their network designs.

2.2.  Content Providers

   A number of content providers use the awareness they have regarding
   the location of IP addresses to reduce the latency of provision and
   to selectively provide content to particular locations.  If a network
   provider publishes geographic information in they will allow content
   providers to more easily direct users traffic to their closest
   provision point.

2.3.  Security Providers

   Computer emergency response teams (CERTs) and law enforcement
   agencies (LEAs) are often concerned with where a network exists as
   this often predicates the efforts required to address concerns of a
   security nature given jurisdictional borders.  For CERTs, this
   knowledge is helpful for identifying an appropriate regional contact
   for assistance when investigating computer system compromise, as well
   as for statistical analysis purposes (for example, to geographically
   map the incidence of occurrence over time).  For law enforcement
   purposes, attribution of network activity will likely have a high
   priority.  Correctness in published information will improve the
   likelihood of successful resolution of security events.

2.4.  Geo-Location (GEO) IP services

   At present GEO IP service providers glean IP location information
   from many sources.  Its accuracy is always subject to the
   authoritativeness of the source in addition to the specificity of the
   provided information.  GEOIP providers often have content providers
   and Security Providers as users of their information, therefore
   correctness of information is far reaching.

2.5.  Research

   There is a constant and ongoing effort to investigate and analyse the
   global internet routing system from many different perspectives.  One
   perspective is related to the geographical position of BGP [RFC4271]
   speakers and the terrestrial location of the route propagation.
   Recording of such information by passive BGP listeners in MRT format
   is described in the MRT BGP routing information export format with
   geo-location extensions [I-D.ietf-grow-geomrt].  If this information
   is provided in the RPKI, close approximation of location can be used
   to model anomalous and unintended routing events in geospatial terms.

3.  Required Reading

   The assumption is made that the reader comprehends the RPKI, the RPKI
   Repository Structure, and the various RPKI objects described in the
   following: [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch], [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs],
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object].

4.  RPKI-GEO Structure

   The structure of the RPKI-GEO object follows the description and the
   generic RPKI validation as described in Signed Object Template for
   the Resource  Public Key Infrastructure [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object]

4.1.  CMS Packaging

   The eContentType of the RPKI-GEO object in the encapContentInfo
   (signed content) section of object is defined as rRPKIGEO with the
   numerical value of [TO BE ASSIGNED].

4.2.  eContent

   The content of a RPKI-GEO object identifies a set of Internet Number
   Resources and the HELD Identity [RFC6155] or HELD Dereference
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-deref-protocol] URI pertaining to the INRs.

   The ASN.1 for the RPKI-GEO object is as follows:

Internet-Draft      Geo-Location information for RPKI          June 2011


   rPKIGEO ::= SEQUENCE {
           Version      [0] INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
           geoLocs      SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF geoObjects
           }

   geoObjects ::= SEQUENCE {
       inrSET           SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF inrObjects,
       heldURI      UTF8String,
       heldTYPE     BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
       }


   inrObjects ::= SEQUENCE {
      asIDs         SEQUENCE (SIZE(0..MAX)) OF ASID,
      ipAddrBlocks  SEQUENCE (SIZE(0..MAX)) OF IPAddressFam
      }

   IPAddressFam ::= SEQUENCE {
      addressFam    OCTET STRING (SIZE (2..3)),
      addresses     SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..MAX)) OF IPAddress
      }

   IPAddress ::= SEQUENCE {
      address       IPAddress,
      length        INTEGER
      }

   ASID ::= INTEGER

   IPAddress ::= BIT STRING

   }


4.3.  rPKIGEO data elements

4.3.1.  Version

   The version number of this version of the rPKIGEO object MUST be 0.

4.3.2.  geoLocs

   This field is a sequence of geoObjects.

4.3.3.  geoObjects

   Each geoObject contains a sequence (inrSET) of inrObjects, a heldURI,
   and a heldTYPE.  The heldURI is a URI to either a HELD identity or

Internet-Draft      Geo-Location information for RPKI          June 2011


   HELD dereference.  The boolean heldTYPE specifies the HELD service
   choice, 0 for identity and 1 for dereference.

4.3.4.  inrObjects

   Each inrObjects contains a sequence (asIDs) of ASID, and a sequence
   (ipAddrBlocks) of IPAddressfam. the minimum number of both sequences
   is zero (0) to allow the maintainer of the object to specify only AS
   numbers or only IP address blocks, or both.

4.3.5.  IPAddressFam

   The IPAddressFam contains the Address Family Identifier (AFI) of an
   IP address family in addressFam as 0001 for IPv4 and 0002 for IPv6.
   Only IPv4 and IPv6 is supported.  The sequence 'addresses' contains
   the IP prefixes.

5.  RPKI-GEO Validation

   After the generic signed objects validation
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object] has been performed, the Version number
   field within the payload is checked.  The payload data is checked
   against the profile defined in this document.  All of these checks
   MUST pass for the RPKI-GEO payload to be considered valid and made
   available for use.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to add the .geo extension to the RPKI
   file extension namespace.

7.  Security Considerations

   The RPKI object described here is used in a descriptive nature and
   provides information that is useful in the analysis and design of
   routing systems.  As such, the authors believe that it does not
   constitute an additional security risk.  It is recommended that the
   issuers of the RPKI-GEO objects consider their own privacy and
   physical securiy concerns before supplying geographical coordinates
   through the RPKI.
