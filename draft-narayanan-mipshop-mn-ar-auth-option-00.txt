Abstract

   FMIPv6 [4] requires signalling messages to be exchanged between a
   mobile node and its access router.  For secure interaction, these
   messages must be authenticated using a security association between
   the access router and the mobile node.  To enable the mobile node and
   the access router unambiguously identify the correct security
   association this document extends the mobility header authentication
   option by defining a subtype to indicate a mobile node - access
   router SPI.  Also, this option can be used in signaling messages used

Internet-Draft              MN-AR Auth Option               October 2005


1.  Introduction

   Fast Handovers for MIPv6 [4] specifies a protocol to improve handover
   latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures by enabling a mobile node bind
   its CoA with its previous Access Router via a Fast Binding Update
   (FBU) message.  To enable the PAR determine that the FBU is generated
   by a genuine MN the FBU message must be protected.  Mechanisms to
   create a shared key between the MN and the AR have been proposed in
   HK_AAA [5] and HK_SEND [6].  This document specifies a means of
   securing the FBU using shared keys that exist between the MN and PAR
   using a MN-AR authentication option.  It extends the mobility message
   authentication option defined in [MIP6_Auth] by defining a subtype to
   indicate a mobile node - access router Security Association.  The
   authentication option enables the mobile node and access router to
   transfer authentication data and utilize an SPI to index between
   multiple MN-AR security associations.  The option defined in this
   document is also used in HK_AAA [5] to exchange the SPI and secure
   MN-AR communication as applicable.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC- 2119 [1].

   In addition, this document uses the following terms:

   MN-AR Mobility Security Association

      Security relation between Mobile Node and its Access Router, used
      to authenticate the Mobile Node for mobility service.  The MN-AR
      Security Association between Mobile Node and Access Router
      consists of a MN-AR mobility SPI, a shared-key, an authentication
      algorithm and the replay protection mechanism in use.

   MN-AR Mobility SPI A number in the range [0-4294967296] used to index
      into the shared-key based MN-AR security associations to protect
      mobility messages.


3.  Applicability

   The MN-AR Authentication Mobility Option is expected to be used in
   FMIPv6 for securing the Fast Binding Update between the MN and the
   old AR.  Also, this option is used in securing the MN-AR Handover Key
   Request/Response messages between the MN and AR in the proposed AAA-
   based handover key derivation model, as described in HK_AAA [5].

Internet-Draft              MN-AR Auth Option               October 2005


   This document itself does not provide guidelines on the exact usage
   of this option in these protocols.  The exact usage of this option
   for an applicable protocol is expected to be defined as part of the
   appropriate protocol specification.  This document only defines the
   type and values for the option itself.


4.  MN-AR Authentication Mobility Option

   This section defines a subtype for the message authentication
   mobility option defined in MIP6_AUTH [2].  The assumption is that
   Mobile Node has a shared-key based security association with the
   Access Router.

4.1.  Format

   The format of the MN-AR authentication mobility option is as defined
   in Figure 2 in [MIP6_Auth].  It has been reproduced here only for
   ease of reference.

   Figure 1: MN-AR Authentication Option

   The MN-AR authentication mobility option uses the subtype value of 3.
   This option should be used to authenticate the Fast Binding Update
   and Fast Binding Acknowledgement messages in FMIPv6 [4] when a
   shared-key based security association exists between the Mobile Node
   and the Access Router.  Also, this option should be used in securing
   the Handover Key Request and Response messages described in HK_AAA
   [5].

   This MUST be the last option in a message with mobility header if it
   is the only authentication option in the message.

   The authentication data is calculated on the message starting from
   the mobility header up to and including the mobility SPI value of
   this option.

Internet-Draft              MN-AR Auth Option               October 2005


   Authentication Data = First (96, HMAC_SHA1(MN-AR Shared key, Mobility
   Data))

   Mobility Data = care-of address | home address | Mobility Header(MH)
   Data

   MH Data is the content of the Mobility Header up to and including the
   mobility SPI field of this option.  The Checksum field in Mobility
   Header MUST be set to 0 to calculate the Mobility Data.

   The first 96 bits from the MAC result are used as the Authentication
   Data field.

4.2.  Processing Considerations

   The Mobile Node should include this option in to secure messages
   exchanged with an access router, if it has a shared-key based
   mobility security association with the Access Router.  While
   including this option the Mobile Node SHOULD use the Mobile Node
   Identifier Option, specifically the MN-NAI mobility option as defined
   in MN_ID_OPT [3] to identify itself while authenticating with the
   Access Router.

   Mobile Node MAY use Message Identifier option as defined in MIP6_AUTH
   [2] for additional replay protection.

   The Access Router should include this option in to secure messages
   exchanged with a mobile node, if it has a shared-key based mobility
   security association with the Mobile Node.

   The Mobile Node or Access Router receiving this option MUST verify
   the authentication data in the option.  If authentication fails, the
   Access Router MUST send an error to the other entity.  The Access
   Router Agent MAY log such events.

   The detailed processing rules for messages that contain this option
   will be defined by the documents specifying the corresponding
   messages.  For instance, the use of this option in FMIPv6 will be
   defined in the protocol specification for FMIPv6.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document assumes the existence of a shared key between the
   Mobile Node and the Access Router.  It proposes new authentication
   options to authenticate the control message between Mobile Node and
   an Access Router.  Given that this option is based on the
   authentication protocol defined in MIP6_AUTH [2], any security

   considerations that apply to the authentication protocol also apply
   to this option.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA services are required for this specification.  The value for
   MN-AR authentication mobility option must be assigned.
