   communicating end-hosts to establish a direct communications path
   with each other even when residing in separate private address
   realms.  The focus of the extensions in this document is on fault-
   tolerance with symmetric locator pairs, and load-balancing is also
   discussed.  This document also updates RFC5206.

1.  Terminology

   In the absence of better terms, this document uses the terms Mobile
   Node (MN) and Corresponding Node (CN) borrowed from Mobile IP
   terminology even though HIP allows both ends to be mobile even
   simultaneously.


2.  Introduction

   The protocol extensions defined in this document extend HIP mobility
   and multihoming to operate in NATted environments.  The extensions
   use combine ICE with HIP to create end-to-end connectivity and global
   naming for end-hosts located in different private address realms.
   This document focuses on fault-tolerance with symmetric locator
   pairs, but also load-balancing is discussed.  This document updates
   [RFC5206].

   The extensions in this document assume that the two communicating
   end-hosts have run successfully the base exchange procedure through a
   HIP Relay as descibed in [I-D.ietf-hip-nat-traversal].  In other
   words this document excludes the mechanisms to solve the initial
   contact problem.  This document specifies extensions that allow HIP
   end-hosts to support end-host mobility and multihoming in NATted
   environments.  The handover procedure is similar to the base exchange
   with NAT extensions.  First, both end-hosts exchange offer and
   answer, i.e, their locators, using UPDATE messages.  Second, the
   hosts start ICE connectivity checks [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] to discover
   a working address pair.  Third, the hosts can use the discovered
   address pair for data traffic.

   End-host mobility usually involves a disconnectivity period while a
   host is moving from a network to another.  The delay caused by the
   disconnectivity period can have negative effects on transport layer
   traffic.  Further, ICE connectivity checks also amplify the delay but
   are necessary to restore the connectivity.  This document proposes
   some optimizations to reduce the length of the disconnectivity
   periods.

   In the case of multihoming, a host first gathers its host candidates
   from its local network interfaces.  Then, it collects server
   reflexive addresses by varying the source interface in UPDATE
   exchanges with RELAY server(s) and STUN server(s).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Mobility and Multihoming Scenarios

   This section discusses end-host and site multihoming use cases.  We
   assume that there are two communicating end-hosts that are located
   behind separate NAT devices.

3.1.  End Host detects mobility event

3.1.1.  Make-before-break

   In the make-before-break scenario the mobile node has at least two
   interfaces that can be simultaneously connected to different networks
   and can have distinct addresses configured.  In the make-before-break
   scenario the existing security association is updated after the new
   pair of IP addresses has been detected to be working.  As an example,
   let's consider a 4G phone with multiaccess capabilities.  First, the
   phone is already transmitting data over one active interface.  Then,
   the phone starts to use the other interface, but only after the
   handover procedure has been completed over the other link.  The phone
   can trigger the handover procedure simultaneously while sending data
   over the active interface.  Figure 1 depicts the make-before-break
   scenario.

           +-------+                            +-------+
           | ISP1  |                            | ISP2  |
           +-------+                            +-------+
               |                                    |
               |     After connctivity checks       |
               |     SA is updated from If1 to If2  |
               |   ----------------------->         |
               |                                    |
               |              +-------+             |
               +--------------|MN host|-------------+
                              +-------+ host attaches the interface
                                        as the link is changed to up

                     Figure 1: Basic make before break

3.1.2.  Break-before-make

   In the break-before-make scenario, the connection to the peer is lost
   for a while when detaching from old access network and while
   attaching to new one.  In this scenario, there is no data transmitted
   to the peer until the new attachment procedure has finished.  A
   common example is that the host detaches from one access network and
   attaches to new one with the same interface.  The detachment period
   may vary from a few milliseconds to hours.  In this scenario, there
   is the possibility that the communication may have to be reinitated

   after the detachment period depending on whether the peer has dropped
   the previous communication context or not.

3.2.  End Host Detects a Failure in the End-to-end Path

3.2.1.  Simultaneous End-host Multihoming

   This section describes a scenario where a mobile host has two network
   interfaces which it uses simultaneously.  The scenario is visualized
   in Figure 2.

                    +-----------+             +-----------+
                    |  ISP1     |             |   ISP2    |
                    +-----------+             +-----------+
                        |                          |
                        |                          |
                        |                          |
                        |                          |
                        |                          |
                        |         +-------+        |
                        +---------|MN host|--------+
                                  +-------+

                Figure 2: Simultaneous End-host Multihoming

   Once the base exchange has been successfully completed as described
   in [I-D.ietf-hip-nat-traversal], the MN can gather the candidates for
   the other interface that was not used during the base exchange.  For
   gathering the candidates, the host may use either an UPDATE exchange
   with the Relay server in Section 5.1.1 or a STUN server.  After
   gathering the candidates, the MN MAY send an UPDATE packet containing
   an ICE offer, and the old SPI value in the ESP_INFO MUST be set to
   zero to denote that the MN creates a new multihoming SA pair that is
   parallel and independent from the SA pair that was previously
   created.  The MN sends the UPDATE packet listing all candidates in
   the LOCATOR using a relay of the CN.  The UPDATE exchange for setting
   up new SAs is same as in the case of mobility described in
   Section 5.1.2.

   Another configuration would be to use multihoming for fault
   tolerance.  In such a case, there is a primary path and a backup
   path.  The backup path could be a "hot backup" or a "cold backup."
   In the hot backup case, the multihoming host knows the backup address
   beforehand and keeps the path up using keepalives as described in
   section Section 5.2.  In the cold backup case, the host detects the
   failure and only then discover the candidates for the alternative
   path.  The hot backup may cost more because the path needs to be kept
   alive.  The cold backup requires just one SA pair which is then

   changed similarly as in the case of mobility.

3.3.  Routing System Detects a Failure in the End-to-end Path

   In site multihoming, the end-host is not usually aware of the
   different paths the site has with the rest of the network.  A typical
   configuration for site multihoming using multiple ISPs for outgoing
   traffic and for redundancy is in Figure 3.  If one of the links fail,
   the traffic is handed over to run over a different link of an ISP.

        +----------+             +----------+               +----------+
        |   ISP1   |             |   ISP2   |     ...       |   ISPn   |
        +----------+             +----------+               +----------+
            |                          |                         |
            |                          |                         |
            |          +---------------------------------+       |
            |          |                                 |       |
            +----------|    NAT with multiple outgoing   |-------+

                       +---------------------------------+
                                    |
                                    |
                                +-------+
                                |  Host |
                                +-------+

                        Figure 3: Site multihoming

   In this scenario, the the host can discover only the public address
   of the NAT.  When a failure occurs, the intrasite routing system will
   simply reroute to an alternative path without the host noticing it.
   The result is that the peer of the host starts receiving packets
   originating from the different transport address that belongs to a
   new NAT device.  The peer learns a new route to the host and can
   start using it after successful HIP return routability or ICE
   connectivity checks.

   To detect the disconnectivity, the host has to periodically send
   keep-alives through the active connection if no other data is being
   sent on the security association.  The keep-alive interval SHOULD be
   configurable.  When the host has not received a response to keep-
   alives for a configurable period, it should gather new ICE candidates
   and send a new ICE offer using an UPDATE packet to the peer.  The
   peer responds to this with an UPDATE packet containing the ICE answer
   after which both of the end-hosts start the ICE connectivity checks.

4.  Locator management

   A multihomed HIP node has multiple locators that can have different
   reachability status.  Some of them can be operational/reachable while
   other may be not.  Fault tolerance is a preferred capability of such
   configuration.  In order to provide basic fault tolerance support, a
   HIP node should be able to perform the following functions: First,
   the multihomed HIP nodes must be able to convey the locally available
   locator set to the peer.  Second, the nodes should be able to monitor
   the communication and detect failures.  In case that a failure is
   detected, they must be able to discover alternative working locator
   pairs and divert the communication through the alternative locator
   pair.  It should be noted that for the provision of basic fault
   tolerance capabilities, the locators are only used sequentially and
   not in parallel.  This is so, because as long a locator pair is
   working, the peers stick to that pair for exchanging data packets and
   they only change the locator pair used when there is a failure.  This
   is different from the general multihoming scenario considered in
   [RFC5206] since locator pairs are not used in parallel.  This
   particular constraint reduces considerably the possibility of packet
   reordering and hence the possibility of having problems with the
   reply protection window due to reordering of packets that travel
   through different paths.

   In the general multihoming scenario defined in [RFC5206], a
   multihomed node is recommended to create different SAs and use
   different SPIs for interface available for the communication between
   two multihomed nodes to avoid problems with the anti-replay
   protection window resulting from reordering packets when using
   multiple paths simultaneously.  While this is required for the
   general multihoming scenario, this is somewhat expensive approach,
   because it requires a high number of SAs to be created and it also
   requires some signaling overhead.  Basically in a multihoming
   scenario where a multihomed node A that has m interfaces is
   communicating with another multihomed node B that has n interfaces,
   they need to exchange m+n UPDATE messages to convey all the locator
   information.  This is so, because they need to convey SPI information
   for each of the interface pairs.  Node A does so by sending an n
   UPDATE messages.  While all the overhead and complexity is required
   when using multiple interface pairs in parallel, this is not the case
   for a fault tolerant configuration, where the locator pairs will be
   used sequentially.

   In order to support fault tolerance, the following behaviour is
   defined for HIP nodes.  Each node conveys the available locator set
   information to the peer in a single UPDATE message.  The Old SPI
   value of the ESP_INFO parameter are equal to the current SPI value.
   Each node uses a single SA and a single SPI value for all the locator



Melen, et al.            Expires April 30, 2009                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  HIP Mobility Extensions for NAT Traversal   October 2008


   pairs available for the configuration.  Only a single locator pair is
   active, and all the traffic is sent using the active locator pair.
   Upon the reception of one UPDATE message containing multiple locators
   with a single SPI value for all the locators, the receiver verifies
   the locators contained in the UPDATE message.  After that, the
   receiver identifies that it is in the fault tolerance scenario and
   creates locator pairs using all the received locators and all the
   locally available locators, irrespectively of the locator to which
   the UPDATE message was sent.  The result is that each of the peers
   has all the locator pairs available for use in case that a failure
   occurs.

   For simultaneous multihoming, an end-host should not assign locators
   that are assigned in different interfaces to a single SPI value.
   Instead, the host should acquire an SPI value value for each
   interface separately.  Each end-host conveys the available locator
   set information to the peer in a separate UPDATE message.  Upon the
   reception of UPDATE message containing multiple locators with a Old
   SPI value zero and the New SPI non-zero for all the locators, the
   receiver verifies the locators contained in the UPDATE message and
   acquire an SPI value value for these locators.  The result is that
   each of the peers has multiple locator pairs available for use to
   transfer the traffic between the hosts.


5.  Packet Processing

   This section describes general packet sending and processing
   procedures in the different NAT traversal scenarios.

5.1.  Handover Procedures

   This section describes the handover procedures using NAT traversal
   techniques.  In order to notify the peer nodes of changed locator(s),
   an end-host MUST execute following steps, summarized below at a high
   level:

   1.  UPDATE its location to the Relay Server(s)

   2.  Update bindings to TURN server(s)

   3.  Gather new unreflexive, reflexive and relayed-transport
       candidates

   4.  Exchange Offer and Answer with its peer nodes

   5.  Execute connectivity and optionally return-routability checks

Internet-Draft  HIP Mobility Extensions for NAT Traversal   October 2008


   6.  Set Preferred bit to zero for all locators.

5.1.1.  HIP Relay Server Update and Gathering New Candidates

   The Relay Client communicates its changes in its locators to its
   Relay Server.  Otherwise, other hosts trying to communicate with the
   Relay Client may fail to contact it.

   [I-D.ietf-hip-nat-traversal] recommends that the HIP Relay does not
   include NAT traversal mode parameter in the base exchange.  As a
   consequence, HIP control plane operates over UDP, but HIP Relay
   Client and Server do not use ICE for connectivity tests.  Therefore,
   the Relay Client MUST use UPDATE to inform its Relay server(s) on its
   new locators as defined in [RFC5206] except that the Client follows
   the UDP encapsulation procedures for type 2 locators as described in
   [I-D.ietf-hip-nat-traversal].

   As an alternative to STUN, host MAY use the UPDATE packet to gather
   the server reflexive addresses from the Relay server.  The Mobile
   Node sends a UPDATE packet containing REG_REQUEST parameter
   registering to the Relay service.  The Relay acknowledges
   registration with REG_RESPONSE and REG_FROM parameters.  The same
   procedure is used to update the registration lifetime in [RFC5203].
   Figure 4 illustrated address gathering procedure combined with
   location UPDATE.

   parameter (LOC in the figure).

5.1.2.  Handover Procedure with ICE

   When there a changes in the locators of the MN, it communicates its
   new LOCATOR set to its CNs.  To reduce the latency of the handover,
   the MN MAY do this in parallel with updating and gathering new

   candidates from its Relay Server as described in Section 5.1.1.  The
   MN learns its peer reflexive transport locator during the handover
   procedure and therefore gathering the server reflexive transport
   locator is not necessary.  The details of the handover are

   End-hosts that have negotiated successfully the ICE-STUN-UDP mode
   during the base exchange, use the HIP UPDATE packet to exchange the
   ICE offer and answer when a locator change is detected as illustrated
   in Figure 5.  The UPDATE packet contains a LOCATOR parameter
   containing unreflexive, reflexive and relayed transport locators of
   the Mobile Node (MN).  In steps 1 and 2, the MN sends the UPDATE
   packet through the relay server that was previously used for the base
   exchange.  The Corresponding Node (CN) responds to the UPDATE with
   another UPDATE packet in steps 3 and 4.  It contains a LOCATOR
   parameter listing unreflexive, reflexive and relayed transport
   locators of the CN.  The MN completes the procedure by acknowledging
   the sequence number in steps 5 and 6.  Finally, the end-hosts start
   the ICE connectivity checks direcly with each other in step 7 as
   described in [I-D.ietf-hip-nat-traversal].  The end-hosts set up a
   pair of IPsec SA for each successfully tested address pair.  In the
   case of failure, the end-hosts send a NOTIFY through the relay to
   each other.

5.1.3.  Handover Procedure without ICE

   End-hosts that have negotiated UDP-ENCAPSULATION mode during the base
   exchange do not use ICE, but instead follow the procedures in
   [RFC5206].  However, the LOCATOR parameter may include type 2
   locators and MUST be sent over transport layer.  The return
   routability tests are established with or without transport layer

   encapsulation according to the type of the locator being tested.  It
   should be noticed that this mode has limited applicability, i.e., the
   return routability checks succeed when only the mobile node is behind
   a NAT.

5.1.4.  Connectivity checks

   After the hosts have exchanged the candidate pairs, they will start
   the connectivity checks for each candidate pair one at a time in a
   specific priority order.  The connectivity checks proceed
   sequentially with paces between the checks to avoid network flooding.
   The pacing of connectivity checks and the priority order are defined
   in [I-D.ietf-hip-nat-traversal].

   In order to recover faster from the data plane disconnectivity, the
   mobile node MAY initiate a return routability test immediately
   through its TURN media relay.  This allows the mobile node to restore
   data plane connectivity in parallel with ICE connectivity checks
   which may take a while to complete.  Further, to facilitate faster
   recovery, successfully tested address pairs MAY be taken into use
   immediately instead of waiting for checks for all addresses to be
   completed in regular ICE nomination.

5.2.  E2E Failure Detection Mechanism

   As described in the [I-D.ietf-hip-nat-traversal], the keepalives
   between HIP end-host and TURN server are STUN Binding Indications.
   Similarly, the keepalives are STUN Binding Indications for two HIP
   hosts that have negotiated ICE-STUN-UDP as the nat traversal mode.
   Keepalives for two HIP hosts operating in UDP-ENCAPSULATION mode use
   HIP NOTIFY messages as keepalives.  Keepalive are send in periods of
   20 seconds, but MUST be omitted if some other traffic (e.g.  ESP)
   occupies the corresponding transport-layer connection.  The absence
   of keepalives and ESP packets are used to detect end-to-end or end-
   to-middle failures according to timeouts based on local policies.
