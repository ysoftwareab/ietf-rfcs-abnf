Internet-Draft Multi-Domained Multi-Homed Mobile Networks September 2006 
    

   This document describes numerous problems associated with deployment 
   of multi-homed, mobile platforms consisting of multiple networks in 
   multiple domains and traversing large geographical areas.  These 
   multi-networked, multi-homed, multi-domained mobile networks are 
   often large platforms such as planes, trains, or ships and even 
   automobiles and spacecraft.  One key characteristic that separates 
   them from general "networks in motion" (NEMOs) is that these 
   platforms have multiple networks that are generally owned and 
   operated by different parties (domains).  Because of the various 
   network domains, policy-based routing and security have some 
   different issues and concerns relative to single-domained systems. 

   Three examples of multi-domained, multi-networked systems include:  
   defense systems, aeronautics systems and space systems.  In all of 
   these systems there are critical control systems that reside in a 
   particular network that requires highly reliable links and time-
   critical information, but limited bandwidth. We shall call this 
   network the "command and control" domain.  A second network may be 
   present for operations and maintenance.  This "operations and 
   maintenance" domain requires little bandwidth.  In addition, 
   information is not as time-critical and reliability is relaxed.   The 
   third network is the "user domain".  This network generally requires 
   much more bandwidth than does command and control network or 
   operations and maintenance.  However, this network, to date, is 
   generally not required to have data reach its destination within a 
   guaranteed time.      

   In the aeronautical industry, all critical air traffic control (ATC) 
   is performed via a closed network.  Currently the air/ground link is 
   not Internet-based, but this is expected to change in the future.  
   All ATC traffic is time-critical and the links must be highly 
   reliable.  However, these links require relatively little bandwidth 
   in the order of 10s of kilobits per second.  This domain, to date, 
   has been a closed network with all infrastructure effectively owned 
   or controlled by the civil air authorities.  In the United States of 
   America, this civil air authority is the Federal Aviation 
   Administration (FAA).   

   The second domain is the used for aircraft operations and maintenance 
   and is call the airline operational communications (AOC) network.  
   Information that may run on this network includes passenger lists, 
   aircraft fuel and weight and other operations and maintenance 
   information.  This link is not as safety critical and the information 
   carried over this link is generally not time-critical.  Like the ATC 
   domain, the AOC domain is closed although traditionally it has 
   resided within the same closed network as ATC.

   The third domain is the passenger domain.  This domain is used for 
   in-flight entertainment (IFE) services and communication.  To date, 
   the IFE network has not been allowed to carry any time critical ATC 
   communications.  This policy is in place in part for security and in 
   part because the IFE network has not been specified and certified to 
   the same time-critical information transfer and reliability as the 
   ATC network.  However that does not imply that the IFE network could 
   not meet those requirements.  

   A second example of multi-domained, multi-networked systems is the 
   deployment of Internet technologies for the United States National 
   Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) space program.  Three 
   domains of interest for a spacecraft are: ground operations located 
   in Florida; mission control located in Texas; and the general science 
   community.  Both ground operations and mission control require 
   reliable, time-critical commanding but do not require large amounts 
   of bandwidth - assuming video in sent on its own links.  The user 
   network (scientific community) has greatly relaxed reliability 
   requirements and does not require time-critical information.  
   However, this network is expected to transport large volumes of data.  
   Each of these networks is effectively owned and operated by a 
   different community of interest on different domains.  

   Other multi-domained, multi-networked systems might be found in 
   military operations, the global shipping industry, taxi and limousine 
   services, and perhaps even in the general automotive industry. 

2. Mobility solution space 

   Mobility here is the ability to move between radio systems and 
   networks without having to reestablish session.  Mobility can be 
   performed as a host-based or network based solution.  Mobility can 
   also be performed at various layers including the radio-link, 
   transport and network layers.  Two network layer technologies are 
   applicable include routing protocols or mobile-ip based solutions 
   such as NEMO.   

2.1. Host-based Solutions 

   Host-based solutions include: SCTP [RFC3286] at the transport layer, 
   HIP [RFC4423] as a shim between the network and transport layers and 
   mobile-ip at the network layer [RFC3344] [RFC3775].  A major problem 
   with host-based where a large number of hosts are sharing the same 
   low-rate radio link is that a binding update storm will occur when a 
   network is traversed.  All hosts have to inform all of their 
   corresponding nodes as well as their location managers (e.g. home 
   agent for mobile-ip, DNS or some other location manager for SCTP, and

   rendezvous servers for HIP) when their location has changed.  This 
   can saturate the RF link.  Thus host-based solutions have a 
   scalability problem for this situation.  

2.2. Radio-link layer mobility 

   Radio-link layer mobility is currently deployed in cellular systems 
   and work effectively over relatively large geographical areas (i.e. 
   countries and continents). Use of radio-link handoffs for mobility 
   provides a partial solution over a limited space.  Radio-link layer 
   handoffs only solve mobility problems for a single link.    It does 
   not address multihoming nor is it scalable over extremely large 
   geographic areas (i.e. globally).  Since multiple providers, possibly 
   with multiple access link technologies, are usually required for 
   global connectivity, link-layer mobility solutions alone are not 
   feasible for global mobility. 

2.3. Transport layer mobility 

   Transport layer mobility using Stream Control Transport Protocol 
   (SCTP) provides route optimization and potentially could provide good 
   convergence times.  As with any non-routing protocol, transport layer 
   mobility requires some sort of location manager to enable a 
   corresponding node to initiate communications.  The location manager 
   is used by the mobile node to register its current location.  Use of 
   Domain Name Servers (DNS) has been shown to functionally perform this 
   function using "do not cache" options.  However, the reliability and 
   convergence time for updating the DNS has not been proven 
   operationally as often times the "do not cache" option is ignored 
   [Pan2004]. 

   SCTP-based transport layer mobility and has been implemented as a 
   host-based solution.  This solution currently is not applicable for 
   large mobile networks.  However, research is being performed to use 
   one-to-one address translation to provide network-based SCTP whereby 
   one host acts and an SCTP proxy for all hosts behind it performing 
   SCTP for all hosts behind it. Conceptually this effectively performs 
   transport-layer mobile routing.  However, even if SCTP can be adapted 
   to handle many nodes, binding update storms may still be a problem.  

2.4. Routing Protocols for Mobile Networks 

   Routing protocols provide route optimization as that is their job.  
   There are a number of problems with using routing protocols to solve 
   the multi-domained, multi-homed mobile network problem including: 
   convergence time, inability to share network infrastructure,

   addressing, scalability and the applicability of some routing 
   protocols for particular applications.   

   Figures 1 and 2 illustrate some of the major issues with using 
   routing protocols for mobile networks.  Figure 1 shows how the 
   current International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
   standards based Aeronautical Telecommunication Network (ATN) as 
   specified by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  
   Figure 2 shows a conceptual migration to use of internet protocols 
   (IP) to perform the same function.

   For mobile networks that require time-critical command and control, 
   fast convergence time is essential. Take, for example, the ATC 
   problem with aircraft takeoff and landing.  This is the most crucial 
   portion of a flight.  One cannot wait 30 to 90 seconds or a few 
   minutes for routes to converge.  The same is true for a spacecraft 
   during launch when it is passing numerous ground stations in a short 
   time.  In order to control the convergence time in aeronautical 
   networks, the ISO Inter Domain Routing Protocol (IDRP) is used 
   [ISO10747].  To further improve convergence time, the network is 
   constructed as a highly controlled two tier architecture consisting 
   of transit routing domains and backbone interconnectivity. The 
   concept is that route propagation will occur quickly in the transit-
   domain where information is time-critical [Sig1998].  Route 
   propagation to geographically distant areas will occur over the 
   backbone where route propagation is not time-critical [Figure 1].   

   In the IP implementation of figure 2, BPG-4 [RFC4271] is seen as an 
   external route to the OSPF network [RFC2328].  Since the aeronautics 
   network is relatively small and currently a closed network operated

   jointly by various civil aviation authorities, OSPF can be used 
   globally.  When a BGP route is advertised to the OSPF network, the 
   OSPF network will immediately propagate the route into the nearest 
   OSPF area thereby provide good convergence time locally where it 
   matters most [Iva2006]. 

   In figures 1 and 2, IDRP and BGP are also used to provide policy-
   based routing capability.  This is of interest and a current 
   requirement for the aeronautics community in order to have time-
   critical command and control flow through one link while other 
   traffic such as air operations flows through another.  Although this 
   requirement has existed within the ICOA ATN specification from the 
   beginning [ICAO9739] [ICAO9705], its use has seen limited deployment 
   to date and is operationally untested for the following reasons: 
   there currently are not enough ATN users to tax the system; system 
   deployment is minimal; and, the airlines generally only have one link 
   active for cost reasons.  For example, satellite links are not turned 
   on unless needed due to the high cost.  Furthermore, two simultaneous 
   VHF radios are not active simultaneously. 

   When using BGP or other routing protocols for mobility, additional 
   problems arise due to addressing.   Routing protocols generally 
   assume the interface connections on the routers are not dynamically 
   changing.  Thus, two routes connected are assumed to be on the same 
   subnet.  One may be able to use "un-numbered" serial interfaces to 
   alleviate this problem, but to date, this has not been proven to 
   work.  Thus, all mobile platforms must reside in the same network or 
   sub-network.  It may be possible to achieve this by having the mobile 
   platform obtain its WAN interface address from the ground using PPP, 
   DHCP, or IPv6 auto configuration. 

   Regarding use of an inter-autonomous system protocol such as BGP, 
   scalability issues arise due to the need to configure peering.  Each 
   BGP router has to have a configuration for each autonomous system 
   (AS) peer that wishes to communicate with.  Thus, each mobile has to 
   have preconfigured for each radio station router it will communicate 
   with.  Likewise, each radio station router will have to be 
   preconfigured for each mobile.  As the number of ground stations or 
   mobile platforms grows, this quickly becomes unmanageable. As new 
   mobile platforms or ground stations are added, all configurations 
   must be updated.  Furthermore, if the mobile platforms have multiple-
   domains, the question of who is authorized to update systems becomes 
   an issue. 

   Using general routing protocols for mobility make it very difficult 
   to share infrastructure.  In order to run routing protocols, one 
   generally has to either own all of the assets or pre-arrange peering

   agreements.  For security reasons, one cannot simple inject routes 
   into another's network.  Furthermore, allowing relatively small 
   mobile networks to inject routes that do not conform to some form of 
   route aggregation will result in route table explosion and is 
   therefore not scalable or desirable 

2.5. NEtworks in MOtion (NEMO) 

   Networks in Motion (NEMO) protocols have been designed specifically 
   to manage the mobility of an entire network (or networks), which 
   changes, as a unit, its point of attachment to the Internet and thus 
   its reachability in the topology [RFC3963]. NEMO protocols also 
   address multihomed networks which may be either a single mobile 
   router (MR) that has multiple attachments to the internet, or may use 
   multiple MRs that attach the mobile network to the Internet.  

   NEMO protocols, by design, avoid many of the problems associated with 
   using general routing protocols for mobile networks including:  
   convergence time, the need for two communicating routers to reside on 
   the same subnet and the need to pre-configure peering relationships. 

   Mobile-ip based solutions such as NEMO solutions have relatively fast 
   convergence times as mobile-ip based protocols simply redirecting the 
   default-route pointer.  However, if one wishes to pass routing 
   protocols down a mobile-ip tunnel, then convergence issues may still 
   exists.  

   NEMO solutions also allow one to easily share.  NEMO solutions do not 
   require the mobile to inject routes into another's network.  Rather, 
   for each radio link one simply contracts with an Internet Service 
   Provider (ISP) for bandwidth and access.  The ISP provides a care-of-
   address once radio-link access is granted.  The user can use the 
   bandwidth however they wish.  (Note, this model may change if mobile 
   network users dominate use of the IPS's network.  At that point, the 
   cost model may change whereby a mobile network user pays an 
   appropriate usage fee relative to the capacity used.)    

   Two areas that NEMO protocols have yet to mature in are support for 
   route optimization and policy-based routing.   

   Current NEMO support requires a bi-directional tunnel between the 
   mobile router and the home agent.  This can result in significant 
   delays when the mobile unit traverses large distances.  These 
   distances can be global distances (or beyond for space systems).  It 
   is highly desirable to have route optimization at least to the point 
   of being able to bind a mobile node to a geographically closer home

   agent.  Route optimization is expected to be the next area of work 
   being performed by the NEMO working group. 

   Another area of route optimization relative to mobile-ip and NEMO is 
   network-based local mobility management (netlmm).  Local  
   mobility involves movements across some administratively and  
   geographically contiguous set of subnets.  When a mobile node  
   moves from one access router to another, the access routers send a  
   route update to the mobility anchor point. While some mobile node  
   involvement is necessary and expected for generic mobility functions 
   such as movement detection and to inform the access router about  
   mobile node movement, no specific mobile node to network protocol 
   will be required for localized mobility management itself.  Netlmm 
   technology may prove useful for common radio systems owned and 
   operated by a single entity.  In the aeronautics community, netlmm 
   may be useful for connecting all of the VHF radios in a given control 
   area.  For a space mission, netlmm between tracking ground stations 
   may greatly improve performance for time critical commanding. 

   Past implementations of NEMO IPv4 or IPv6 protocols only allow for 
   binding to one care-of-address.  In this situation, a multihomed 
   mobile router can only use one link at a time.  It is not capable of 
   using two or more links even if they are available.  Use of multiple 
   links simultaneously is desirable for a number of reasons including 
   load balancing and policy-base routing.  The problem of policy-base 
   routing is currently being investigated by Mobile Nodes and Multiple 
   Interfaces in IPv6 (monami6) working group.  Two topics being 
   investigated that of interest to multi-domained, multi-homed mobile 
   networks are: 

  . A protocol extension to Mobile IPv6 (RFC 3775) and NEMO Basic 
     Support (RFC 3963) to support the registration of multiple Care-of-
     Addresses at a given Home Agent address [Wak2006]. 

  . A "Flow/binding policies exchange" solution for an exchange of 
     policies from the mobile host/router to the Home Agent and from the 
     Home Agent to the mobile host/router influencing the choice of the 
     Care-of Address and Home Agent address [Sol2006]. 

3. Policy-based routing 

   Figures 3 through 6 illustrate the advantages of policy-based routing 
   in a mobile aeronautical network.  Consider the mobile network having 
   three links available.  One link is classified as highly reliable but 
   relatively low rate.  This link is reserved for command and control.  
   The second link is a low-latency, low-bandwidth link.  The third link

   is high-rate for passenger services.   Assume it is possible to set 
   policy with the following rules:   

     . Only ATC traffic is allowed to use the reliable link. 

     . Data precedence is set such that ATC is highest priority, AOC is 
        next highest and passenger traffic has lowest priority. 

     . ATC and AOC traffic are allowed to use the low-latency link 

     . ATC, AOC and passenger traffic are allowed to use the high-rate 
        link. 

     . Link preference for ATC is reliable link - highest, low-latency 
        link - middle, high-rate - last. 

     . Link preference for AOC is low-latency followed by high-rate. 

    

   Figure 3 shows all links active.   Figure 4 shows that ATC traffic 
   can be delivered even if all other links are unavailable.  Figure 5 
   shows that ATC and AOC traffic have precedence over passenger traffic 
   and could use the high-rate link if their preferred links are 
   unavailable.   Figure 5 is of greatest interest because one could 
   conceivably make this the preferred link for all traffic if safety-
   of-flight QoS requirements could be met.  Doing so would release 
   spectrum to ATC and AOC as many users could be using the high-rate 
   links when available. (For aeronautical communications, RF spectrum 
   is a precious and limited resource.)   |

4. Radio Operations 

   Mobile networks are wireless and may utilize many types of radio 
   systems.  It is imperative to understand the interaction between 
   particular radio systems and the routing and transport protocols.  
   For example, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) has algorithms 
   to enable it to probe the network for capacity and adjust 
   accordingly.  Streaming video or rate-based protocols do not and can 
   easily saturate a link if not properly controlled.  Two techniques 
   that can be used to control non-congestion-friendly protocols are 
   policy-base routing and queue management. 

 
4.1. Layer-2 Triggers 

   For low rate (10s of kbps) radio links such as current avionics links 
   some minimal quality-of-service can be accomplished via message 
   prioritization.   When link capacity is low there is little need to 
   have a feedback mechanism between the radio and the router to enhance 
   QoS.   Current and future high-rate links would benefit greatly by 
   having a standardized feedback mechanism between the radio systems 
   and the router.   Such mechanism could indicate if a link is 
   available and the quality and bandwidth of the link.   The former is 
   important for fast handovers between links.  The latter is of 
 
 
Ivancic                 Expires March 18, 2007                [Page 13] 

Internet-Draft Multi-Domained Multi-Homed Mobile Networks September 2006 
    

   particular importance for bandwidth-on-demand systems.   For 
   instance, the Boeing Connexion outbound radio link can operate from 
   approximately 16 kbps up to 1 or 2 Mbps in 16 kbps increments.  This 
   rate is continually varying depending on outbound traffic demands and 
   satellite network congestion.   Assuming the interface between the 
   router and Connexion radio is an Ethernet connection, some type of 
   layer-2 trigger or feedback to the router is necessary to determine 
   the available data rate.   If the interface is serial, having the 
   radio provide the clock may solve the data rate problem.   

4.2. Multiplexing Links 

   When building a robust mobile communication system, it is highly 
   desirable to have multiple radio types to ensure communication (e.g. 
   cellular, WiFi, satellite).  Each of these radio link technologies 
   operates at different frequencies and has different antenna 
   technologies that must be incorporated into the system design.  Radio 
   systems and their associated antenna systems can add significant 
   size, mass and power to communication systems.  Thus, although it is 
   highly desirable to have multiple radio systems, there is a practical 
   limit to what can be deployed.  One most certainly does not want to 
   have to deploy multiple radios of the same technology.  Rather one 
   will multiplex communications over similar radios. 

4.2.1. Multiplexing at the Radio  

   Figure 6 illustrates multiplexing communications at the radio link.  
   For each link, all information must be queued and prioritized in the 
   "MUX" box.  This is not overly difficult.   

   One of the main problems with multiplexing at the radios is that the 
   MUX box must obtain or be configured for addressing on the various 
   wireless networks.  The MUX box must pass this addressing on to the 
   NEMO routers.  For example, the MUX on the WiFi network may obtain 
   its Wide Area Network (WAN) address via DHCP.  The MUX must now 
   provide addressing to the various NEMO routers attached to the 
   ingress side.  Does the WiFi MUX provide different addresses to each 
   NEMO router or the same address?  How is this done?  One would like 
   this to be a standardized method. 

   One advantage that the architecture in figure 6 provides is physical 
   separation of the NEMOs.  Thus, security issues for this architecture 
   may be accomplished using a conventional approach.  However, if each 
   NEMO is getting the same WAN address, this is certainly not 
   conventional.

4.2.2. Multiplexing at the Router 

   Figure 7 illustrates combining information in the router rather than 
   a special MUX box per figure 6.  Here, multiple NEMOs are configured 
   in a single router.  There are many advantages to this architecture 
   over the one in figure 6.  First, there is no need for MUX boxes.  
   Second, only one router interface is necessary for each radio system; 
   therefore, traditional forms of acquiring a WAN address can be 
   used(i.e. DHCP, PPP, Auto-configuration, manual configuration) and 
   the same address is not assigned to multiple interfaces.  Third, only 
   one router is required for multiple NEMOs versus use of multiple 
   NEMOs, one for each domain.  Thus, there is potential for mass, 
   power, volume and cost savings.  Furthermore, this architecture is 
   potentially much easier to manage. 

   A definite security concern with multiplexing NEMOs and radios at the 
   router is that various domains may be cross connected if 
   configurations are not tightly controlled.

5. Network Access (auto-login) 

   Obtaining access to a wireless network may be non-trivial for a 
   mobile platform, depending on the wireless technology being deployed.  
   A mobile platform SHOULD be able to obtain network access in an 
   automated manner.   

5.1. Cellular Access 

   For cellular systems, access is usually accomplished via prearranged 
   security and access agreements.  A user contracts for bandwidth with 
   a service provider and obtains a cellular modem that has a 
   corresponding electronic serial number. When the modem (phone) makes 
   a call, it transmits the ESN and the Mobile Identification Number 
   (MIN)- also referred to as MSID (Mobile Station Identification)- to 
   the network at the beginning of the call. The MIN/ESN pair is a 
   unique tag for each modem and is used to establish the system's 
   credentials and allow access to the wireless network. PPP or some 
   other protocol can then be used to obtain a care-of-address.

5.2. Satellite Access 

   Satellite radio network access may be performed in a similar manner 
   to cellular radio systems depending on the provider.  In some 
   satellite modems a form of electronic serial number or media access 
   control (MAC) address is associated with a modem.  Once the ESN (or 
   MAC) is validated, the user obtains access to the network.  Network 
   addresses are obtained using PPP or statically configured addresses. 

5.3. WiFi Access 

   WiFi radio access is somewhat different than cellular or satellite 
   access.   Three basic modes of wireless network access are used: open 
   network, preconfigured and negotiated.   

   For open networks, any radio simply scans for a radio network and 
   obtains access.  Layer-3 address is usually provided via DHCP.  Such 
   radio and layer-3 access works well for a machine access (i.e. mobile 
   router access). 

   A preconfigured access will work for machine-to-machine operations.  
   Such pre-configurations are usually found on private networks.  Here, 
   a pre-placed key may be used along with a security protocol such as 
   Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) (802.11 encryption protocol).  Media 
   Access Control physical addresses may also be configured into access 
   list to limit what radios are allowed to connect to the network.    

   As security and accountability concerns grow, radio network access is 
   moving toward negotiated access.  Here, a user/name and password or 
   some type of token ID and password are required for access.  Such 
   secure radio network access techniques include Extensible 
   Authentication Protocol (EAP), and WiFi Protected Access (WPA).  
   Currently such systems focus on the needs of the human mobile user 
   who is in need of short term network access.  Machine-to-machine 
   negotiation of radio network access is not part of this operational 
   scenario.  Such concepts are new and businesses cases have yet to be 
   considered.  For NEMOs to take advantage of WiFi networks, techniques 
   that allow for machine-to-machine radio access without the need for 
   human intervention are imperative. 

6. Costs 

   Although not a protocol issue, the ISP cost model plays a significant 
   role in the ability to deploy large mobile networks especially if 
   they are multi-domained, multi-homed mobile networks.  Fixed rate 
   network access is essential to make it viable to budget for a mobile 
   network.  Paying a fixed price for a fixed amount of bandwidth works

   well as end users can budget for this cost model. If one has to pay 
   by the amount of data that transitions a given network or connect 
   time, it becomes extremely difficult to budget operations.  For 
   large-capacity users as it is extremely difficult to project how much 
   data one will transfer over the link from one month to the next.  
   Likewise, if one is being charged for connect time, one needs to 
   deploy a mechanism that only brings a link up when it is needed.  
   This results in a system that is out-bound oriented.  Peer-to-peer 
   communications only occurs when the links are turned on.  Thus, in 
   order for a corresponding node to initiate communications with the 
   mobile node, some sort of back-channel has to be used to the mobile 
   node to turn on the link of interest. 

7. Security Considerations 

   Having a single router operating in multiple domains either via 
   generic routing protocols or use of mobile-ip based NEMO protocols 
   has serious security issues.  The possibility of having a single 
   mobile router connected to multiple home agents residing in various 
   domains implies that these domains could be inadvertently connected 
   if the mobile router is misconfigured.  Similarly, unless great care 
   is taken to configure mobile platform routers that use generic 
   routing, cross-domain connectivity can easily occur.  

   Management of multi-domain routers is an interesting policy problem.  
   "Who has authority to configure and control the mobile unit? 

   ISPs often implement security mechanisms that break NEMO and mobile-
   ip.  One example of this is deployment of administrative filtering.  
   Here, an ISP may decide to have an out-bound only policy such that 
   all traffic must have originated from within their network.  At least 
   one GPRS ISP has such a policy in place.  One explanation provided 
   for such a policy is to keep potentially hostile Internet traffic off 
   the network.  Probing the GPRS system address space not only posses a 
   threat to customers, but, more importantly steals precious GPRS 
   bandwidth from the users [Iva2003]. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA considerations as this is an informational 
   document.
