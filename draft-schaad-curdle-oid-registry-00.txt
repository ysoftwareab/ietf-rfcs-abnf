        Object Identifier Registry for the Curdle Working Group
                  draft-schaad-curdle-oid-registry-00

Abstract

   When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of
   object identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for use
   by that working group.  This document describes the range of
   identifiers that were assigned in that donated range, transfers
   control of that range to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation
   policies for any future assignments within that range.

1.  Introduction

   When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of
   object identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for use
   by that working group.  These object identifiers are primarily used
   with Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) [ASN.1].  The ASN.1
   specifications continue to evolve, but object identifiers can be used
   with any and all versions of ASN.1.

   The Curdle object identifier range is:

     { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 100 }
     to
     { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 127 }

   This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in
   that donated range, transfers control of the range to IANA, and
   establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments
   within that range.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to create one new registry table.

2.1.  "SMI Security for Curdle" Registry

   Within the SMI-numbers registry, add an "SMI Security for Curdle"
   table with the three columns:

   The column 'Decimal' is required to be a number between 100 and 127
   inclusive.

   Future updates to this table require both 'Specification Required'
   and 'Expert Review' as defiened in [RFC5226].

3.  Security Considerations

   This document populates an IANA registry, and it raises no new
   security considerations.  The protocols that specify these values
   include the security considerations associated with their usage.
