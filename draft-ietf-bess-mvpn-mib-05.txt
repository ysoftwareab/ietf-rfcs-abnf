1.  Introduction

   [RFC6513], [RFC6514], and [RFC6625] specify procedures for supporting
   multicast in Border Gateway Protocol/MultiProtocol Label Switching
   (BGP/MPLS) Layer 3 (IP) Virtual Private Network (VPN).  Throughout
   this document, we will use the term "Multicast VPN (MVPN)" [RFC6513]
   to refer to a BGP/MPLS IP VPN that supports multicast.

   Provider Edge routers (PEs) exchange the VPN customer multicast
   (C-multicast) routing information with each other.  In [RFC6513], two
   basic methods for exchanging C-multicast routing information are
   defined (1) Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) [RFC7761] and (2)
   BGP.

   In the rest of this document we will use the term "PIM-MVPN" to refer
   to PIM being used for exchanging C-multicast routing information, and

   "BGP-MVPN" to refer to BGP being used for exchanging C-multicast
   routing information.

   This document describes managed objects to configure and/or monitor
   MVPN.  The managed objects are common to both PIM-MVPN and BGP-MVPN.

   Comments should be made directly to the BESS WG at bess@ietf.org.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [RFC6513] and other documents that [RFC6513] refers to.
   Familiarity with Multicast, MPLS, Layer 3 (L3) VPN, MVPN concepts
   and/or mechanisms is assumed.  Some terms specifically related to
   this document are explained below.

   MVPN can be achieved by using various kinds of transport mechanisms
   for forwarding a packet to all or a subset of PEs across service
   provider networks.  Such transport mechanisms are referred to as
   provider tunnels (P-tunnels).

   "Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI)" [RFC6513] is a
   conceptual interface instantiated by a provider tunnel (P-tunnel), a
   transport mechanism used to deliver multicast traffic.  A PE uses to
   send customer multicast traffic to all or some PEs in the same VPN.

   There are two kinds of PMSI: "Inclusive PMSI (I-PMSI)" and "Selective
   PMSI (S-PMSI)" [RFC6513].  An I-PMSI is a PMSI that enables a PE
   attached to a particular MVPN to transmit a message to all PEs in the
   same VPN.  An S-PMSI is a PMSI that enables a PE attached to a
   particular MVPN to transmit a message to some of the PEs in the same
   VPN.

   As described in [RFC4382], each PE router maintains one default
   forwarding table and "VPN Routing and Forwarding tables", or "VRFs".
   Throughout this document, we will use the term "multicast VRF (MVRF)"
   to refer a VRF that is configured to contain the multicast routing
   information.

   Interchangeably, the term MVRF and MVPN are used to refer to a
   particular Multicast VPN instantiation on a particular PE.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  MCAST-VPN-MIB

   This document defines MCAST-VPN-MIB, a MIB module for monitoring and/
   or configuring MVPNs on PEs.

3.1.  Summary of MIB Module

   The configuration and states specific to an MVPN include the
   following information elements:

   o  C-multicast routing information exchange protocol (PIM or BGP)

   o  I-PMSI, S-PMSI and corresponding P-tunnels

   o  Mapping of C-multicast routing information to PMSI tunnels

   To represent these information elements, MCAST-VPN-MIB defines eight
   tables: mvpnGeneralTable, mvpnBgpGeneralTable, mvpnSpmsiConfigTable,
   mvpnPmsiConfigTable, mvpnIpmsiTable, mvpnInterAsIpmsiTable,
   mvpnSpmsiTable, mvpnMrouteTable.

   The following four tables represent the MVPN configurations on PEs.

   o  mvpnGeneralTable

   o  mvpnBgpGeneralTable

   o  mvpnSpmsiConfigTable

   o  mvpnPmsiConfigTable

   The following diagram shows the relationship among those four tables
   use for configuration.  Each box in the diagram represents a table,

Internet-Draft             L3VPN Multicast MIB             December 2017


   and the label of each box corresponds to a table name.  An arrow
   indicates that one table has a pointer to a row in another table.
   The entry in mvpnGeneralTable and mvpnSpmsiConfigTable has a pointer
   to the row pertaining to the entry in the mvpnPmsiConfigTable.

        +--------------+
        | mvpnBgp      |
        | GeneralTable |
        +--------------+    +-------------------+    +-----------------+

        +--------------+    +-------------------+    +-----------------+

   o  mvpnGeneralTable

      This table represents MVPNs that are configured on a PE.  Each
      entry in this table is created for each MVRF representing an
      instance of MVPN.  The entry represetns general configuration/
      states of the MVRF, including Inclusive PMSI (I-PMSI)
      configuration.  The MVPN represented by the entry in this table
      must have the corresponding VRF in MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB [RFC4382].

   o  mvpnBgpGeneralTable

      This table augments the aformentioned mvpnGeneralTable.  This
      table contains BGP-MVPN specific managed objects.

   o  mvpnSpmsiConfigTable

      This table contains managed objects necessary for configure
      Selective PMSI (S-PMSI) associated with an MVRF on a PE.

   o  mvpnPmsiConfigTable

      This table contains managed objects common to both I-PMSI and
      S-PMSI configurations.  Both I-PMSI configuration (in the entry in
      mvpnGeneralTable) and S-PMSI configuration (in the entry in
      mvpnSpmsiConfigTable) refer to an entry in this table.

   The following four tables are designed for monitoring MVPNs on PEs.

   o  mvpnIpmsiTable

   o  mvpnInterAsIpmsiTable

   o  mvpnSpmsiTable

   o  mvpnMrouteTable

   The following diagram shows the relationship among these four tables
   and the l2l3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable defined separately in
   L2L3-VPN-MCAST-MIB [I-D.ietf-bess-l2l3-vpn-mcast-mib].  The entry in
   every table has a pointer to the row pertaining to the entry in the
   l2l3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable.

        +--------------+    +-------------------+    +-----------------+
        |  mvpnIpmsi   | -> | l2L3VpnMcastPmsi  | <- |    mvpnSpmsi    |

        | IpmsiTable   |    +-------------------+
        +--------------+

   o  mvpnIpmsiTable

      This table contains managed objects for monitoring all Intra-AS
      I-PMSIs advertised and received by a PE.  This table contains all
      advertised and received Intra-AS I-PMSIs.  With PIM-MVPN, it is
      applicable only when BGP-Based Autodiscovery of MVPN Membership is
      used.

   o  mvpnInterAsIpmsiTable

      This table contains all advertised and received Inter-AS I-PMSIs.
      With PIM-MVPN, it is applicable only when BGP-Based Autodiscovery
      of MVPN Membership is used.

   o  mvpnSpmsiTable

      This table contains managed objects for monitoring all S-PMSIs
      advertised and received by a PE.

   o  mvpnMrouteTable

      This table augments
      ipMcastMIB.ipMcast.ipMcastRouteTable [RFC5132], for some MVPN
      specific information.

   o  l2l3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable

      An entry of this table corresponds to a PMSI Tunnel attribute and
      is maintained by a PE router that advertises and receives the
      attribute.  Th entry in this table is referred by entries in

     DESCRIPTION
         "A mvpnMvrfChange notification signifies a change about
          a MVRF in the PE. The change event can be creation of
          the MVRF, deletion of the MVRF or an update on the I-PMSI
          or S-PMSI configuration of the MVRF. The change event
          is indicated by mvpnGenMvrfStatusChange embedded in
          the notification. The user can then query
          mvpnGeneralTable, and/or mvpnSpmsiConfigTable to
          get the details of the change as necessary.

          Note: Since the creation of a MVRF is often followed by
          configuration of I-PMSI and/or S-PMSIs for the MVRF,
          more than one (three at most) notifications for a MVRF may
          be generated serially, and it is really not necessary to
          generate all three of them. An agent may choose to generate a
          notification for the last event only, that is for S-PMSI

          configuration.

          Similarly, deletion of I-PMSI and S-PMSI configuration on a
          MVRF happens before a MVRF is deleted and it is recommended
          that the agent send the notification for MVRF deletion
          event only.

4.  Security Considerations

   This MIB contains some read-only objects that may be deemed senstive
   by some though perhaps not all operators.  It also contains some
   read- write objects, whose setting will change the device's behavior
   related to MVPN.  Appropriate security procedures related to SNMP in
   general but not specific to this MIB need to be implemented by
   concerned operators.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.  These
   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  mvpnNotificationEnable, mvpnGenCmcastRouteProtocol,
      mvpnGenIpmsiConfig, mvpnGenInterAsPmsiConfig, mvpnGenUmhSelection,
      mvpnGenSiteType, mvpnGenSptnlLimit, mvpnBgpGenMode,
      mvpnBgpGenVrfRtImport, mvpnPmsiConfigEncapsType,
      mvpnSpmsiConfigThreshold, mvpnSpmsiConfigPmsiPointer

   o  mvpnGenRowStatus, mvpnPmsiConfigRowStatus,
      mvpnSpmsiConfigRowStatus

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TBD]

Internet-Draft             L3VPN Multicast MIB             December 2017


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to root MIB objects in the MIB module contained in
   this document under the mib-2 subtree.
