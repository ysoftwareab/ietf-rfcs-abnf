    The	alternative RFC822 name	quoting	convention is also  allowed  for

e=Mark Handley <mjh@isi.edu>

    The	free text string should	be in the ISO-10646 character  set  with
    UTF-8 encoding, or alternatively in	ISO-8859-1 or other encodings if
    the	appropriate charset session-level attribute is set.

b=<modifier>:<bandwidth-value>


b=X-YZ:128

    SDP	parsers	should ignore bandwidth	fields with  unknown  modifiers.
    Modifiers  should  be alpha-numeric	and, although no length	limit is
    given, they	are recommended	to be short.

     To	make announcements more	compact, times	may  also  be  given  in
    units  of  days, hours or minutes.	The syntax for these is	a number
    immediately	followed by a single  case-sensitive  character.   Frac-
    tional  units  are	not  allowed  -	 a  smaller  unit should be used
    instead.  The following unit specification characters are allowed:
	    d -	days (86400 seconds)
	    h -	minutes	(3600 seconds)
	    m -	minutes	(60 seconds)
	    s -	seconds	(allowed for completeness but not recommended)

    Thus, the above announcement could also have been written:

r=7d 1h	0 25h

    Monthly and	yearly repeats cannot currently	 be  directly  specified
    with  a  single SDP	repeat time - instead separate "t" fields should
    be used to explicitly list the session times.

a=cat:<category>
    This attribute gives the dot-separated hierarchical	category of  the
    session.   This  is	to enable a receiver to	filter unwanted	sessions
    by category.  It would probably  have  been	 a  compulsory	separate
    field,  except  for	 its  experimental nature at this time.	 It is a
    session-level attribute.

a=keywds:<keywords>
    Like the cat attribute, this is to assist  identifying  wanted  ses-
    sions at the receiver.  This allows	a receiver to select interesting
    session based on keywords describing the purpose of	the session.  It
    is a session-level attribute.

a=tool:<name and version of tool>
    This gives the name	and version number of the tool	used  to  create
    the	session	description.  It is a session-level attribute.

a=ptime:<packet	time>
    This gives the length of time in  milliseconds  represented	 by  the
    media  in a	packet.	This is	probably only meaningful for audio data.
    It should not be necessary to know ptime to	decode RTP or vat audio,
    and	   it	 is    intended	   as	 a    recommendation   for   the
    encoding/packetisation of audio.  It is a media attribute.

a=recvonly
    This specifies that	the tools should be started in receive-only mode
    where applicable. It can be	either a session or media attribute.

a=sendrecv
    This specifies that	the tools should be started in send and	 receive
    mode.  This	is necessary for interactive conferences with tools such
    as wb which	defaults to receive only mode. It can be either	 a  ses-
    sion or media attribute.

a=sendonly
    This specifies that	the tools should be started in	send-only  mode.
    An	example	 may  be where a different unicast address is to be used
    for	a traffic destination than for a traffic source. In such a case,
    two	media descriptions may be use, one sendonly and	one recvonly. It
    can	be either a session or media attribute,	but would normally  only
    be used as a media attribute.

a=orient:<whiteboard orientation>
    Normally this is only used in a whiteboard media  specification.  It
    specifies  the orientation of a the	whiteboard on the screen.  It is
    a media attribute.	Permitted values are `portrait', `landscape' and
    `seascape' (upside down landscape).

a=type:<conference type>
    This specifies the type of the  conference.	  Suggested  values  are
    `broadcast',  `meeting', `moderated', `test' and `H332'.  `recvonly'
    should be the default for `type:broadcast' sessions,  `type:meeting'
    should imply `sendrecv' and	`type:moderated' should	indicate the use
    of a floor control tool and	that the media tools are started  so  as
    to ``mute''	new sites joining the conference.

    Specifying the attribute type:H332 indicates that this loosely  cou-
    pled  session is part of a H.332 session as	defined	in the ITU H.332
    specification [10].	 Media tools should be started `recvonly'.

    Specifying the attribute type:test is  suggested  as  a  hint  that,
    unless  explicitly	requested  otherwise, receivers	can safely avoid
    displaying this session description	to users.

    The	type attribute is a session-level attribute.


a=charset:<character set>
    This specifies the character set to	be used	to display  the	 session
    name  and information data.	 By default, the ISO-10646 character set
    in UTF-8 encoding is used.	If  a  more  compact  representation  is
    required,  other  character	 sets may be used such as ISO-8859-1 for
    Northern European languages.   In  particular,  the	 ISO  8859-1  is
    specified with the following SDP attribute:

a=charset:iso8859-1

a=framerate:<frame rate>
    This gives the maximum  video  frame  rate	in  frames/sec.	  It  is
    intended  as  a  recommendation  for  the  encoding	 of  video data.
    Decimal representations of	fractional  values  using  the	notation
    "<integer>.<fraction>" are allowed.	 It is a media attribute, and is
    only defined for video media.


a=quality:<quality>
    This gives a suggestion for	 the  quality  of  the	encoding  as  an
    integer value.

    The	intention of the quality attribute for video  is  to  specify  a
    non-default	 trade-off  between  frame-rate	and still-image	quality.
    For	video, the value in the	range 0	to 10, with the	 following  sug-
    gested meaning:


    10	- the best still-image quality the compression scheme can give.

    5	- the default behaviour	given no quality suggestion.

    0	- the worst still-image	quality	the  codec  designer  thinks  is
	still usable.



a=fmtp:<format>	<format	specific parameters>
    This attribute allows parameters that are specific to  a  particular
    format  to	be conveyed in a way that SDP doesn't have to understand
    them.  The format must be one  of  the  formats  specified	for  the
    media.   Format-specific  parameters  may  be  any set of parameters
    required to	be conveyed by SDP and given unchanged to the media tool
    that will use this format.
