 Conveying Vendor-Specific Information in the Path Computation Element
    (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions for stateful PCE.
                 draft-dhody-pce-stateful-pce-vendor-04

Abstract

   A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information on
   the current network state, including: computed Label Switched Path
   (LSPs), reserved resources within the network, and pending path
   computation requests.  This information may then be considered when
   computing new traffic engineered LSPs, and for associated and
   dependent LSPs, received from Path Computation Clients (PCCs).

   RFC 7470 defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information in
   PCEP.

   This document extends this capability for the stateful PCE model.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440]
   provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform
   path computations in response to Path Computation Clients' (PCCs)
   requests.

   A stateful PCE is capable of considering, for the purposes of path
   computation, not only the network state in terms of links and nodes
   (referred to as the Traffic Engineering Database or TED) but also the
   status of active services (previously computed paths, and currently
   reserved resources, stored in the Label Switched Paths Database
   (LSPDB).  [RFC8051] describes general considerations for a stateful
   PCE deployment and examines its applicability and benefits, as well
   as its challenges and limitations through a number of use cases.

   [RFC8231] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to provide stateful
   control.  A stateful PCE has access to not only the information
   carried by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), but also
   the set of active paths and their reserved resources for its
   computations.  The additional state allows the PCE to compute
   constrained paths while considering individual LSPs and their
   interactions.  [RFC8281] describes the setup, maintenance and
   teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model.  These
   extensions added new messages in PCEP.

Internet-Draft               VENDOR-STATEFUL                  March 2018


   [RFC7470] defined Vendor Information object that can be used to carry
   arbitrary, proprietary information such as vendor-specific
   constraints.  It also defined VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV that can be used
   to carry arbitrary information within any existing or future PCEP
   object that supports TLVs.

   This document extend the usage of Vendor Information Object and
   VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV to stateful PCE.  The VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV
   can be carried inside any of the new objects added in PCEP for
   stateful PCE as per [RFC7470], this document extend the PCEP messages
   to also include the Vendor Information Object too.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Procedures for the Vendor Information Object

   A Path Computation LSP State Report message [RFC8231] (also referred
   to as PCRpt message) is a PCEP message sent by a PCC to a PCE to
   report the current state of an LSP.  A PCC that wants to convey
   proprietary or vendor-specific information or metrics to a PCE does
   so by including a Vendor Information object in the PCRpt message.
   The contents and format of the object are described in Section 4 of
   [RFC7470].  The PCE determines how to interpret the information in
   the Vendor Information object by examining the Enterprise Number it
   contains.

   The Vendor Information object is OPTIONAL in a PCRpt message.
   Multiple instances of the object MAY be used on a single PCRpt
   message.  Different instances of the object can have different
   Enterprise Numbers.

   The format of the PCRpt message (with [RFC8231] as base) is updated
   as follows

                             <state-report-list>

         <vendor-info-list> ::= <VENDOR-INFORMATION>
                                 [<vendor-info-list>]

         <path> is defined in [RFC8231].

   A Path Computation LSP Update Request message (also referred to as
   PCUpd message) is a PCEP message sent by a PCE to a PCC to update
   attributes of an LSP.  The Vendor Information object can be included
   in a PCUpd message to convey proprietary or vendor-specific
   information.

   The format of the PCUpd message (with [RFC8231] as base) is updated
   as follows

         <PCUpd Message> ::= <Common Header>
                             <update-request-list>

                             [<update-request-list>]

         <update-request> ::= <SRP>
                              <LSP>
                              <path>
                              [<vendor-info-list>]
      Where:
         <vendor-info-list> ::= <VENDOR-INFORMATION>
                                 [<vendor-info-list>]

         <path> is defined in [RFC8231].

   A Path Computation LSP Initiate Message (also referred to as
   PCInitiate message) is a PCEP message sent by a PCE to a PCC to
   trigger LSP instantiation or deletion.  The Vendor Information object
   can be included in a PCInitiate message to convey proprietary or
   vendor-specific information.

   The format of the PCInitiate message (with
   [RFC8281] as base) is updated as follows

        <PCInitiate Message> ::= <Common Header>
                                 <PCE-initiated-lsp-list>

                                              [<vendor-info-list>]

        Where:

        <vendor-info-list> ::= <VENDOR-INFORMATION>
                               [<vendor-info-list>]

      <PCE-initiated-lsp-deletion> and <attribute-list> is as per
      [RFC8281].

   A legacy implementation that does not recognize the Vendor
   Information object will act according to the procedures set out in
   [RFC8231] and [RFC8281].  An implementation that supports the Vendor
   Information object, but receives one carrying an Enterprise Number
   that it does not support, SHOULD ignore the object as per [RFC7470].

3.  Procedures for the Vendor Information TLV

   The Vendor Information TLV can be used to carry vendor-specific
   information that applies to a specific PCEP object by including the
   TLV in the object.  This includes objects used in stateful PCE
   extension such as SRP and LSP object.  All the procedures as per
   section 3 of [RFC7470].

4.  Vendor Information Object and TLV

   [RFC7470] specify the format of VENDOR-INFORMATION Object and VENDOR-
   INFORMATION-TLV.

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA consideration.

6.  Security Considerations

   The protocol extensions defined in this document do not change the
   nature of PCEP.  Therefore, the security considerations set out in
   [RFC5440], [RFC7470], [RFC8231] and [RFC8281] apply unchanged.

   As stated in [RFC6952], PCEP implementations SHOULD support the TCP-
   AO [RFC5925] and not use TCP MD5 because of TCP MD5's known
   vulnerabilities and weakness.  PCEP also support Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) [RFC8253] as per the recommendations and best current
   practices in [RFC7525].
