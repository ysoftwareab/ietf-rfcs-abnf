1.  Problem Statement

   This document defines new IPv4 [RFC0791] Operations and Management
   (OAM) capabilities.  In order to support these capabilities, this
   document defines a new interpretation of the IPv4 Reserved-flag.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

            Figure 1: Current Defintion Of The IPv4 Flags Field

   Figure 1 depicts the IPv4 Flags field, as defined in [RFC0791].  It
   contains the following fields:

   o  Bit 0: reserved, must be zero

   o  Bit 1: (DF) 0 = May Fragment, 1 = Don't Fragment.

               Figure 2: Redefintion Of The IPv4 Flags Field

   Figure 2 depicts a redefinition of the IPv4 flags field.  It contains
   the following fields:

   o  Bit 0: OAM 0 = No OAM Action, 1 = OAM Action

   o  Bit 1: (DF) 0 = May Fragment, 1 = Don't Fragment.

   o  Bit 2: (MF) 0 = Last Fragment, 1 = More Fragments.

   In the redefinition, the Reserved-flag is replaced by an OAM flag.

4.  OAM Flag Processing

4.1.  At Network Ingress Nodes

   When a packet enters a provider network, the network ingress router
   can subject the packet to policy.  Policy includes match conditions
   and actions.  If the packet satisfies match conditions, the policy
   can execute the following actions:

   o  Set the OAM-bit

   o  Recompute the IPv4 header checksum

   If the ingress node sets the OAM bit, it MAYexecute any of the OAM
   actions described in Section 4.2.

4.2.  At Network Interior Nodes

   When a network interior node receives a packet and its OAM bit is
   set, it MAY execute any combination of the following OAM actions.

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

                           Table 1: OAM Actions

   The action taken depends on local configuration.  By default, no
   action is taken

4.3.  At Network Egress Nodes

   When a network egress node receives a packet and the OAM bit is set,
   it MAY execute any of the OAM actions described in Section 4.2.  It
   SHOULD clear the OAM bit.  If it clears the OAM bit, it MUST
   recompute the IPv6 Header Checksum.

                                 Figure 3

   Figure 3 depicts the ICMP OAM message.  The ICMP OAM message contains
   the following fields:

   o  Type - OAM.  Value TBD by IANA.

   o  Code - MUST be set to (0) No Error.

   o  Checksum - See [RFC0792]

   o  Reserved - MUST be set to 0 and MUST be ignored upon receipt.

   o  Length - Represents the length of the padded "original datagram"
      field, measured in 32-bit words.

   o  Timestamp (seconds) - Represents the time at which the original
      packet arrived in Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC5905] format.

   o  Timestamp (fraction) - Represents the time at which the original
      packet arrived in NTP [RFC5905] format.

   o  Original Datagram - As much of invoking packet as possible without
      the ICMPv6 packet exceeding the minimum ICMP MTU (576 bytes).  The
      original datagram MUST be zero padded to the nearest 32-bit
      boundary.

   ICMP OAM messages SHOULD be rate limited by the sender.

   The Timestamp fields SHOULD be as accurate as possible.  They SHOULD
   reflect the time at which the original packet arrived, not the time
   at which the ICMPv6 OAM message was sent.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add an entry to the ICMP Type registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-
   parameters.xhtml#icmp-parameters-types).  The ICMP message name is
   OAM and its value is TBD by IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   All OAM actions elicited by the OAM bit must be rate-limited, so that
   they cannot be used as denial of service attack vectors.
