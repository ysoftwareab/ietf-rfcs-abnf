        Support for Adj-RIB-Out in BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
                   draft-ietf-grow-bmp-adj-rib-out-00

Abstract

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to only the Adj-RIB-
   In Routing Information Bases (RIBs).  This document updates the BGP
   Monitoring Protocol (BMP) RFC 7854 by adding access to the Adj-RIB-
   Out RIBs.  It adds a new flag to the peer header to distinguish Adj-
   RIB-In and Adj-RIB-Out.

1.  Introduction

   BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines monitoring of the received
   (e.g.  Adj-RIB-In) Routing Information Bases (RIBs) per peer.  The
   Adj-RIB-In pre-policy conveys to a BMP receiver all RIB data before
   any policy has been applied.  The Adj-RIB-In post-policy conveys to a
   BMP receiver all RIB data after policy filters and/or modifications
   have been applied.  An example of pre-policy verses post-policy is
   when an inbound policy applies attribute modification or filters.
   Pre-policy would contain information prior to the inbound policy
   changes or filters of data.  Post policy would convey the changed
   data or would not contain the filtered data.

   Monitoring the received updates that the router received before any
   policy has been applied is the primary level of monitoring for most
   use-cases.  Inbound policy validation and auditing is the primary
   use-case for enabling post-policy monitoring.

Internet-Draft               BMP Adj-RIB-Out                   June 2017


   In order for a BMP receiver to receive any BGP data, the BMP sender
   (e.g. router) needs to have an established BGP peering session and
   actively be receiving updates for an Adj-RIB-In.

   Being able to only monitor the Adj-RIB-In puts a restriction on what
   data is available to BMP receivers via BMP senders (e.g. routers).
   This is an issue when the receiving end of the BGP peer is not
   enabled for BMP or when it is not accessible for administrative
   reasons.  For example, a service provider advertises prefixes to a
   customer, but the service provider cannot see what it advertises via
   BMP.  Asking the customer to enable BMP and monitoring of the Adj-
   RIB- In is not feasible.

   This document updates BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) RFC 7854
   [RFC7854] peer header by adding a new flag to distinguish Adj-RIB-In
   verses Adj-RIB-Out.

   Adding Adj-RIB-Out enables the ability for a BMP sender to send to a
   BMP receiver what it advertises to BGP peers, which can be used for
   outbound policy validation and to monitor RIBs that were advertised.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Definitions

   o  Adj-RIB-Out: As defined in [RFC4271], "The Adj-RIBs-Out contains
      the routes for advertisement to specific peers by means of the
      local speaker's UPDATE messages."

   o  Pre-Policy Adj-RIB-Out: The result before applying the outbound
      policy to an Adj-RIB-Out. This normally would match what is in the
      local RIB.

   o  Post-Policy Adj-RIB-Out: The result of applying outbound policy to
      an Adj-RIB-Out. This MUST be what is actually sent to the peer.

4.  Per-Peer Header

   The per-peer header has the same structure and flags as defined in
   section 4.2 [RFC7854] with the following O flag addition:

Internet-Draft               BMP Adj-RIB-Out                   June 2017


                              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                             |V|L|A|O| Resv  |
                             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  The O flag indicates Adj-RIB-In if set to 0 and Adj-RIB-Out if set
      to 1.

   The existing flags are defined in section 4.2 [RFC7854] and the
   remaining bits are reserved for future use.  They SHOULD be
   transmitted as 0 and their values MUST be ignored on receipt.

5.  Adj-RIB-Out

5.1.  Post-Policy

   The primary use-case in monitoring Adj-RIB-Out is to monitor the
   updates transmitted to the BGP peer after outbound policy has been
   applied.  These updates reflect the result after modifications and
   filters have been applied (e.g.  Adj-RIB-Out Post-Policy).  The L
   flag MUST be set to 1 in this case to indicate post-policy.

5.2.  Pre-Policy

   As with Adj-RIB-In policy validation, there are use-cases that pre-
   policy Adj-RIB-Out is used to validate and audit outbound policies.
   For example, a comparison between pre-policy and post-policy can be
   used to validate the outbound policy.  The L flag MUST be set to 0 in
   this case to indicate pre-policy.

6.  BMP Messages

   Many BMP messages have a per-peer header but some are not applicable
   to Adj-RIB-In or Adj-RIB-Out monitoring.  Unless otherwise defined,
   the O flag should be set to 0 in the per-peer header in BMP messages.

6.1.  Route Monitoring and Route Mirroring

   The O flag MUST be set accordingly to indicate if the route monitor
   or route mirroring message conveys Adj-RIB-In or Adj-RIB-Out.

6.2.  Statistics Report

   Statistics report message has Stat Type field to indicate the
   statistic carried in the Stat Data field.  Statistics report messages
   are not specific to Adj-RIB-In or Adj-RIB-Out and MUST have the O
   flag set to zero.  The O flag SHOULD be ignored by the BMP receiver.

Internet-Draft               BMP Adj-RIB-Out                   June 2017


   The following new statistic types are added:

   o  Stat Type = TBD: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in Adj-RIBs-Out
      Pre-Policy.

   o  Stat Type = TBD: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in Adj-RIBs-Out
      Post-Policy.

   o  Stat Type = TBD: Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI Adj-RIB-Out Pre-
      Policy.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family
      Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier
      (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   o  Stat Type = TBD: Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI Adj-RIB-Out
      Post-Policy.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family
      Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier
      (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

6.3.  Peer Down and Up Notifications

   PEER UP and DOWN notifications convey BGP peering session state to
   BMP receivers.  The state is independent of whether or not route
   monitoring or route mirroring messages will be sent for Adj-RIB-In,
   Adj-RIB-Out, or both.  BMP receiver implementations SHOULD ignore the
   O flag in PEER UP and DOWN notifications.  BMP receiver
   implementations MUST use the per-peer header O flag in route
   monitoring and mirroring messages in order to identify if the message
   is for Adj-RIB-In or Adj-RIB-Out.

7.  Security Considerations

   It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
   considerations.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA assign the following new parameters
   to the BMP parameters name space [1].

8.1.  BMP Peer Flags

   This document defines the following new per-peer header flags
   (Section 4):

   o  Flag 3 as O flag: The O flag indicates Adj-RIB-In if set to 0 and
      Adj-RIB-Out if set to 1.

8.2.  BMP Statistics Types

   This document defines four new statistic types for statistics
   reporting (Section 6.2):

   o  Stat Type = TBD: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in Adj-RIBs-Out
      Pre-Policy.

   o  Stat Type = TBD: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in Adj-RIBs-Out
      Post-Policy.

   o  Stat Type = TBD: Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI Adj-RIB-Out Pre-
      Policy.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family
      Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier
      (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   o  Stat Type = TBD: Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI Adj-RIB-Out
      Post-Policy.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family
      Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier
      (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
