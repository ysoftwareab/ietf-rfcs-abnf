               Use case: Dissemination of IP packets to

Abstract

   This document describes the use case where IP packets are 
   disseminated to geographical areas, based on geographical location 
   information. A source node, which may be located anywhere, sends 
   packets to an access router through the Internet. 
   Those access routers are selected based on geographical location 
   information, and traffic is routed to them using the IP address of 
   the router and conventional IP routing. Each of the destination 
   access routers then copies and broadcasts the received packets to 
   listeners within its (1) radio coverage for wireless access routers 
   or (2) IP subnet for wired access routers.

1.  Introduction

   Internet-based applications are currently using IP addresses to 
   address interfaces of a node that can be for example a host, a 
   server or a router. IP routing and addressing are completely unaware 
   of geographic parameters such as coordinates or postal addresses. 

   Future applications and use cases have been identified that need to 
   support among others the dissemination IP packets to geographical 
   areas. This document describes the use case where IP packets are 
   disseminated to geographical areas, based on geographical location 
   information.

   This document is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the 
   terminology. Section 3 provides the brief description of this use 
   case. Section 4 provides the security considerations. The IANA 
   considerations are given in Section 5. Section 6 gives the 
   acknowledgements and Section 7 lists the used references.

2.  Terminology 

   Internet-wide Geo Networking 

      the solution space that includes mechanisms and protocols used to 
      disseminate packets sent by authorized source nodes located 
      anywhere in the Internet to other nodes in areas described by 
      geographical parameters.

   Geographic coordinate system:
 
      a coordinate system that enables every location on the Earth to be 
      specified by a set of numbers or letters.

3. Dissemination of IP packets to geographical areas

   This use case applies to any source node that is located anywhere in 
   the Internet and based on geographical location information, needs to 
   send packets to destination nodes located in a geographical area. 
   Such source and destination nodes can be used in many types of 
   applications, such as: environmental monitoring, consumer electronic 
   devices (e.g. cameras) and scientific instruments.
   Such a source node, needs to send IPv4 or IPv6 packets to any 
   destination node that is located in a certain geographical area. 
   Therefore, the only addressing information that the source nodes can 
   use is the geographical coordinates of the given area.
   In this use case it is assumed that within the given geographic 
   area a communication infrastructure exists, where wireless access 
   routers, see Figure 1 and wired access routers, see Figure 2 are 
   supported. 

   A solution is needed, where the access routers are selected based on 
   the available geographical location information, and where the 
   traffic is routed to them using the IP address of the router and 
   conventional IP routing. Each of the destination access routers then 
   copies and broadcasts the received packets to listeners within its  
   (1) radio coverage for wireless access routers, see Figure 1, or (2) 
   IP subnet for wired access routers, see Figure 2, where either IPv4 
   subnet broadcast or IPv6 multicast addressing to the all-hosts 
   multicast group techniques can be used.

   Internet-wide Geo Networking (GeoNet) can be used to provide the 
   above described solution.

4.  Security Considerations 
    
   Due to the sensitivity of location data and the possibility of the 
   technology being used in emergency and/or road traffic management 
   scenarios a particular attention must be paid to security and 
   privacy. Security objectives  particularly include integrity, privacy 
   and non-repudiation and SHOULD protect the network and transport 
   layer protocol headers. In addition any potential Internet-wide Geo-
   networking solution MUST also protect privacy, i.e. provide
   confidentiality to personal data and protect leaking 
   information through protocol behavior, such as the relation between 
   identifier and location.

5.  IANA Considerations  
   No IANA considerations are considered in this document.
