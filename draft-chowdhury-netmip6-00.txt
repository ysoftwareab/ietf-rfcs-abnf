1.  Introduction and Scope

   Network based L3 mobility management allows any mobile node to
   connect to a mobile wireless network and maintain its L3
   connectivity while crossing link boundaries.  This type of mobility
   management solution does not necessarily require any Mobile IPv6
   implementation in the mobile node.  Rather, the L3 mobility is
   handled entirely in the network via a Mobile IPv6 function in a
   network node such as an Access Router (AR).

   In a typical mobile wireless network the inter base station handoffs
   (often called L2 handoffs) are handled by local mobility management
   protocols.  There are various flavors of such protocols deployed
   today.  When the mobile node incurs handoff to a base station that is
   attached to an Access Router in a different link than the current
   one, the L3 mobility management procedure is invoked by the mobile
   node to re-register the new Care-of Address with the Home Agent.
   However, if the mobile node does not have Mobile IPv6 implementation
   it's L3 will break and the session will terminate abnormally.  If the
   mobile node has Mobile IPv6 implementation, there are solutions to
   handle inter AR handoffs via techniques like Fast MIPv6 [RFC4068].
   The solution offers early establishment of the link with the new AR
   albeit requiring number of messages exchanged over the air and still
   requiring the mobile node to re-register with the Home Agent even if
   the mobile user is in the middle of a real time conversation.  The
   requirement of additional messaging over the air to manage handoff
   that can be easily managed by the network nodes is a problem that
   this document addresses.

   The solution provided in this document allows any mobile node to
   connect to the network and be mobile without Mobile IPv6 in the
   mobile node and without losing its L3 connectivity or having to
   perform additional signaling to maintain L3 connectivity during
   handoffs.

3.  Solution Overview

   The solution has two aspects.  The first aspect deals with the
   network connection setup.  The second aspect deals with the L3
   mobility management.

3.1  Network Connection Setup

   The mobile node connects to the mobile wireless network via any
   access technology e.g.  CDMA, GPRS, 802.11, 802.16e etc.  After
   establishing L2 connection with the network, the mobile node
   initiates L3 establishment by requesting an IPv6 address from the
   network.  There are various ways the mobile node can request for an
   IPv6 address e.g.  IPv6CP [RFC2472], IPv6 stateless address autoconf
   [RFC2462], and DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

   The following message sequence diagram shows the network connectivity
   procedure.

   Description of the steps:

   1a.  MN and the NAS performs L2 establishment with the base station
   (not shown) and performs access authentication/authorization.  During
   this phase, the MN may run CHAP or PAP if PPP is used or EAP over foo
   if PPP is not used.  The AR acts as the NAS in this phase.

   1b.  The NAS exchanges AAA messages with the AAA infrastructure to
   perform authentication and authorization of the MN.  As part of this
   step, the AAA server may download some information about the MN (e.g.
   user's profile, handset type, assigned home agent address, and other
   capabilities of the MN) if needed.

   2.  The MN sends an IPv6CP config request to the NAS/AR in case of
   PPP to configure the IID.  Subsequently, the MN sends an Router
   Solicitation to request an IPv6 address prefix.  If DHCPv6 is used,
   the DHCPv6 client in the MN sends a DHCP SOLICIT or REQUEST message.
   It is assumed in this document that the AR has a DHCPv6 proxy/server
   function.

   3.  Triggered by step 2 the MIPv6 Client in the AR (Net-MIPv6) sends
   a Mobile IPv6 Binding Update (BU) to the Home Agent.  The Home
   Agent's address if either received at step 1b from the Home AAA or it
   is provisioned in a out of band way at the AR.  The BU contains the
   Care-of Address (CoA) of the AR.  The HoA field is set to ALL-ZERO-
   ONES-ADDRESS if not already assigned by the AAA at step 1b.  It is
   assumed that the AR and the HA either has an IPsec SA setup to
   protect the BU and the AR and the HA uses auth protocol [RFC4285]
   based security.  These security aspects are to be defined in more
   details either in the current document or in some other document.

   4.  The home agent registers the MN's session and assigns an HoA.
   The home agent returns the HoA in the BA.

   5.  The AR/NAS sends an RA with IPv6 address prefix with the prefix
   of the HoA to the MN.  If DHCPv6 was used at step 2, the AR/
   DHCP-proxy/server sends back a DHCP Reply with the IPv6 address set
   to the received HoA.

   6.  At this step, the MN's IPv6 stack is ready to receive or send
   IPv6 packets.  If DHCPv6 is used, the regular DHCPv6	messages are
   exchanged and the MN's IPv6 stack is configured with the assigned
   IPv6 address.

3.2  Inter AR Handoff

   After connecting to the access network, the MN may incur inter AR
   handoff due to mobility.  This poses the challenge of keeping the L3

   connection for the MN intact due to possible change in the link.

   The following message sequence diagram shows how the network
   connectivity can be maintained across an inter AR handoff.

   1.  MN is connected at the Serving AR (SAR) and it is sending/
   receiving data via SAR.  The HA has a tunnel established with the
   SAR.

   2.  The MN moves into an area of a target Base Station (not shown in
   the figure) that is connected to a target AR (TAR).  The target BS
   sends a HO indication message (out of scope of this document) to the
   target AR.  This message contains the address of the SAR and the MN
   identifier (NAI) among other parameters.

   3.  Based on the trigger at step 2, the TAR sends a HO Request
   message to the SAR to fetch the relevant context for the MN.  The
   ICMPv6 HO Request message is defined in the following section  of
   this document.  Note that the TAR and the SAR share a security
   association.  The HO Request message can be protected with an IPsec
   authentication header using the security association between the ARs.

   4.  Upon receiving the HO Request message the SAR validates it by
   checking it's security association with the TAR. if the validation
   succeeds, the SAR sends all the state information (context) for the
   identified MN to the TAR in a ICMPv6 HO Response message.

   5.  The Mobile IPv6 Client in the TAR sends a Binding Update to the
   HA with its' CoA (CoA of the TAR) and sets the HoA to the HoA of the
   MN which is received as part of the state information at step 4.

   6.  Upon receiving the BU from the TAR, the HA updates it's BCE with
   the new	CoA and an HoA to the MN and returns the HoA in an RRP.
   Since the binding/tunnel with the SAR is still not torn down, the HA
   has an option of bi-casting to both SAR and TAR at this time.

   7.  At this time, the MN connects L2 with the target BS.  The target
   BS (not shown in the figure for brevity) informs the TAR that the MN
   has connected to the target system.  The Serving BS also detects that
   the handoff (L2 torn down with the MN) and it informs the SAR about
   this event.

   8.  Upon receiving the HO event from the Serving BS, the SAR tears
   down the tunnel with the HA.

   9.  The MN continues to receive service (i.e. send/receive data)
   with the same IPv6 address which is the HoA.  The MN is agnostic to
   the L3 mobility procedures in the network.

5.  HMIPv6 Considerations

   HMIPv6 [RFC4140] is a MIPv6 (experimental) extension to support
   localized mobility management.  The base HMIPv6 protocol supports
   mobile controlled mobility management and hence requires MN to be
   aware of the MN's local CoA, Regional CoA and HoA.  The MN manages
   localized mobility management (e.g., mobility inside a MAP domain) by
   updating binding between LCoA and RCoA while it moves inside the
   coverage area of the MAP (Mobility Anchor Point, ref: RFC4140)
   domain.  It performs Global Mobility Management (e.g., inter-MAP
   mobility) by updating binding between RCoA and HA to Home Agent and
   CN while it moves from one MAP domain to other.  The use of vanilla
   HMIPv6 enables mobile controlled localized mobility management, but
   does not enable network controlled mobility management required by
   some deployments.

5.1  Network Based HMIPv6 Operation

   In some special deployment scenarios localized mobility management
   may be desired.  In this document, we are proposing a network
   controlled mobility management scheme that is based on modified
   HMIPv6 protocol, Net-HMIPv6.  The Net-HMIPv6 protocol re-uses HMIPv6
   signaling and HMIPv6 MAP function to enable network controlled
   localized mobility management.  The Net-HMIPv6 protocol introduces a
   network based MIPv6 Client (NetMIPv6) that is responsible for sending
   binding updates on behalf of a MN to the MAP.  The NetMIPv6 Client
   performs mobility management signaling on behalf of a MN as long as
   the MN moves inside the coverage area of a given MAP domain.  The
   NetMIPv6 Client uses link layer specific mechanism to detect movement

   of a mobile node from one AR to other AR inside a MAP domain.  To
   manage intra-MAP mobility on behalf of MN, the NetMIpv6 Client keeps
   updating the MAP about the mapping between LCoA and RCoA every time
   the MN changes its point of attachment from one AR to another inside
   the same MAP domain.  The MIPv6 protocol can be used along with Net-
   HMIPv6 to provide global mobility management when a MN moves from one
   MAP to other.  The NetMIPv6 Client also acquires local care of
   address every time a mobile moves from one MAP domain to another.
   The LCoA is derived using TAR prefix information and RCoA is derived
   using MAP prefix information.  The Net-HMIPv6 solution uses trust
   model between the NetMIPv6 Client and the MAP in place of end-to-end
   security model of HMIPv6 as end-to-end security may be difficult to
   achieve in this mode of operation.  The subsequent revisions of this
   document will investigate further the end-to-end security model if
   any that can be used to along with Net-HMIPv6 based solution.

5.2  Net-HMIPv6 and MIPv6 Interaction

   The Net-HMIPv6 is able to inter-work with vanilla Mobile Node based
   MIPv6 protocol (C-MIPv6) [RFC3775].  The C-MIPv6 protocol is used to
   manage Global Mobility Management (GMM) when a MN moves from one AR
   to other inside a given MAP.  To avoid the MN to initiate GMM as long
   it moves from SAR to TAR inside a given MAP domain, the proposed Net-
   HMIPv6 solution requires that ARs belonging to a given MAP domain to
   advertise prefix associated with the MAP instead of its own prefix.
   This is required to prohibit the C-MIPv6 stack in the MN to initiate
   global mobility when it moves from one AR to another inside a given
   mobility domain.  The advertisement of MAP prefix to the MN ensures
   that the MN only detects prefix change when it moves away from one
   MAP to other.  If the Client does not have a C-MIPv6 implementation
   and/or the GMM is also entirely performed by the network nodes as
   described in section 3 of this document, this requirement on the ARs
   does not apply.

6.  Node Requirements

   This section describes the requirements for each of the nodes
   involved.

6.1  Mobile Node Requirements

   This solution does not impose any new requirement on the MN.  Any MN
   with an IPv6 stack and DHCPv6 or IPv6CP implementations should work.

6.2  Access Router/NetMIPv6 Client Requirements

   TBD.

6.3  Home Agent Requirements

   TBD.

6.4  MAP Requirements

   TBD.

7.  Security Considerations

   The HO Request and the HO Response messages SHOULD be protected via
   IPsec AH.  In the absence of such security, the context information
   of the MN's ongoing session at the SAR may be compromised when sent
   to a rogue AR.

   At the time of L2 establishment, the SAR may receive security keying
   information for the MN from the Home AAA server that can be used to
   secure the subsequent BU.  The HA should be able to retrieve the
   corresponding security keying material from the Home AAA server to
   process the BU and send the BA.

   Alternatively, if individual security keying material per MN are not
   available at the AR and the HA, the AR and the HA SHOULD secure the
   BU/BA by a common security association that they share.

   The support for Route Optimization and the associated security
   mechanism to protect the return routability signaling is outside the
   scope of this document.  The mechanism proposed in this document
   allows for dynamic HA assignment.  Hence the possibility of a
   inefficient transport due to reverse tunnel can be significantly
   mitigated.

   HMIPv6 supports end-to-end security.  However, use of Net-HMIPv6
   based approach would require trust between NetMIPv6 Client in the AR
   and the MAP.  Also, it is to be noted that security of HMIPv6 is
   closely tied to RCoA allocation, hence RCoA need to be allocated in
   such a way that uniqueness of RCoA allocation is guaranteed otherwise
   existing HMIPv6 security would break.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The following ICMPv6 messages need IANA assignment:

   HO Request:

   Type: TBD-1.

   Code: TBD-2.
