1.  Introduction

   In the Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) architecture [RFC8279],
   packets with a BIER encapsulation header are forwarded to the
   neighbors on the underlay paths towards the BFERs.  The paths are
   calculated in the underlay topology for each sub-domain following a
   calculation algorithm specific to the sub-domain.  The topology or
   algorithm may be congruent with unicast.  The algorithm could be a
   generic IGP algorithm (e.g.  SPF) or could be a BIER specific one
   defined in the future.

   This document specifies general rules for the interaction between the
   BIER Algorithm (BAR) and the IGP Algorithm (IPA) used for underlay
   path calculation.  The semantics defined in this document update
   [RFC8401], [RFC8444].

2.  Updated Definition for BAR and IPA Fields

   The definition for the BAR and IPA fields in [RFC8401] and [RFC8441]
   are updated as following.

   IPA: IGP Algorithm.  Specifies a generic Routing Algorithm (RA) and
   related Routing Constraints (RC) to calculate underlay paths to reach
   other BFRs.  Values are from the "IGP Algorithm Types" registry
   [RFC8665].

   BAR: BIER Algorithm.  Specifies a BIER-specific Algorithm (BA) and
   BIER-specific Constraints (BC) used to either modify, enhance, or
   replace the calculation of underlay paths to reach other BFRs as
   defined by the IPA value.  Values are allocated from the "BIER
   Algorithm" registry [RFC8401].

   When a BAR value is defined in a RFC or used in a deployment, the
   corresponding BA and BC semantics SHOULD be specified in the RFC or
   for the deployment.  For an IGP Algorithm to be used as a BIER IPA,
   its RA and RC semantics SHOULD be specified in a RFC or for the
   deployment.

   If a BAR value is not specified in a RFC but only privately used for
   a deployment, it MUST be within the "240-254 Experimental Use" range
   of the registry.

   None of the components of the BAR or IPA can be unknown.  If any of
   the components is not specified, it is interpreted as "NULL"
   algorithm or constraint.  For example, the IGP Algorithm 0 defined in
   [RFC8665] is treated as having a NULL RC, i.e., no constraints.

3.  General Rules for the BAR and IPA Interaction

   For a particular sub-domain, all BIER Forwarding Routers (BFRs) MUST
   be provisioned with and signal the same BAR and IPA values.  If a BFR
   discovers another BFR advertising different BAR or IPA value for a
   sub-domain, it MUST treat the advertising router as incapable of
   supporting BIER for that sub-domain (one way of handling incapable
   routers is documented in Section 6.9 of [RFC8279] and additional
   methods may be defined in the future).

   For a particular topology X that a sub-domain is associated with, a
   router MUST calculate the underlay paths according to its BAR and IPA
   values in the following way:

   1.  Apply the BIER constraints, resulting in BC(X).

   2.  Apply the routing constraints, resulting in RC(BC(X)).

   3.  Select the algorithm AG as following:

       A.  If BA is NULL, AG is set to RA.

       B.  If BA is not NULL, AG is set to BA.

   4.  Run AG on RC(BC(X)).

   It's possible that the resulting AG is not applicable to BIER, In
   that case, no BIER paths will be calculated and it is a network
   design issue that an operator needs to avoid when choosing BAR/IPA.

3.1.  When BAR Is Not Used

   BAR value 0 is defined as "No BIER-specific algorithm is used"
   [RFC8401].  This value indicates NULL BA and BC.  Following the rules
   defined above, the IPA value alone identifies the calculation
   algorithm and constraints to be used for a particular sub-domain.

3.2.  Exceptions/Extensions to the General Rules

   Exceptions or extensions to the above general rules may be specified
   in the future for specific BAR and/or IPA values.  When that happens,
   compatibility with defined BAR and/or IPA values and semantics need
   to be specified.

4.  Examples

   As an example, one may define a new BAR with a BIER specific
   constraint of "excluding BIER incapable routers".  No BIER specific
   algorithm is specified, and the BIER specific constraint can go with
   any IPA - whatever RC defined by the IPA is augmented with "excluding
   BIER incapable routers", i.e., routers that do not support BIER are
   not considered when applying the IGP Algorithm.

   If the BC and RC happen to conflict and lead to an empty topology,
   then no BIER forwarding path will be found.  For example, the BC
   could be "exclude BIER-incapable routers" and the RC could be
   "include green links only".  If all the green links are associated
   with BIER-incapable routers, it results in an empty topology.  That
   is a network design issue that an operator needs to avoid when
   choosing BAR/IPA.

   In another example, a BAR value can be specified to use Steiner Tree
   algorithm and used together with IPA 0 (which uses SPF algorithm).
   According to the general rules, the BIER specific algorithm takes
   precedence so SPF is not used.

5.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA Consideration is requested in this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies general rules for the interaction between the
   BIER Algorithm (BAR) and the IGP Algorithm (IPA) used for underlay
   path calculation.  It does not change the security aspects as
   discussed in [RFC8279], [RFC8401], [RFC8444].

7.  Acknowledgements

   others for their suggestions and comments.  In particular, the
   BC/BA/RC/RA representation for the interaction rules is based on
   Alia's write-up.
