Internet-Draft     IMAP4 Channel Transport Mechanism           July 2004


1.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORD].

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" preface lines sent by the client and the
   server respectively.

2.  Protocol Framework

   This memo defines the following extensions to [IMAP4].

2.1  CAPABILITY Identification

   IMAP4 servers that support this extension MUST advertise the
   "CHANNEL" capability.

2.2  CHANNEL Command

   The CHANNEL command requests that message data be retrieved through
   an external scheme.  Clients may issue a request specifying a
   partially-qualified URI, in which case the server will determine the
   final connection end\-point.  What constitutes a partially-qualified
   URI is implementation defined.

   The syntax of the CHANNEL command is:

   tag CHANNEL channel-uri-list channel-set

   <channel-uri-list> is a list of URIs and schemes specifying how the
   client desires to retrieve the message data.  If <channel-uri-list>
   contains more than one element the server SHOULD return the message
   data using the first element in the list it is capable of using.

   <channel-set> is a list of message-number/body-section pairs
   describing the content to be retrieved.  The message number specifies
   the sequence number of the message to act on.

   The CHANNEL command is only valid in the selected state.

   Example:

   C: 0 CHANNEL (rtsp ftp://marvin@example.net/incoming/)
       (1 2)(3 1)(3 9.1)

   asks for section 2 of message 1 and sections 1 and 9.1 of message 3.
   The preferred retrieval scheme is RTSP.  If RTSP isn't available the
   IMAP server should attempt to transfer the requested data to the FTP

   server at example.com.

   In either case the server will fill in the connection end-point
   information.

2.3  UID CHANNEL Command

   The UID CHANNEL command is identical to the CHANNEL command with the
   exception that the message numbers in the sequence sets refer to
   unique identifiers instead of message sequence numbers.

2.4  CHANNEL Response

   An untagged CHANNEL response is returned for each message-number/
   body-section pair specified by the corresponding CHANNEL command:

   * message-number CHANNEL section-spec URI

   The ordering of these responses is arbitrary.  The message number and
   <section-spec> in the response mirror those in the corresponding
   request, therefore responses to UID CHANNEL commands report the
   message UID rather than the message sequence number.

   The server MUST NOT issue an untagged CHANNEL response containing a
   URI until such time as that URI is avaliable for the client to
   dereference.  The lifetime of the URI is implementation defined.

   For example, the responses to the example command in the previous
   section might look like:

   S: * 1 CHANNEL 2 rtsp://frobozz.example.com/144124
   S: * 3 CHANNEL 1
       ftp://marvin@example.com/incoming/abzzqfw11423
   S: * 3 CHANNEL 9.1 NIL
   S: 0 OK done

   The NIL response to the section 9.1 request indicates that the part
   could not be retrieved via any of the requested schemes.  For
   example, this could be caused by the inability to convert or
   represent the content via the requested schemes, or because a
   resource was unavailable.

2.5  CHANNELSCHEMES Command

   The CHANNELSCHEMES command queries the server for the list of schemes
   it supports.

Internet-Draft     IMAP4 Channel Transport Mechanism           July 2004


   The syntax of the CHANNELSCHEMES command is:

   tag CHANNELSCHEMES


2.6  CHANNELSCHEMES Response

   A tagged CHANNELSCHEMES response is returned in response to a
   CHANNELSCHEMES command.

   The syntax of the CHANNELSCHEMES response is:

   tag CHANNELSCHEMES channelschemes-data


3.  Command Sequencing

   There is no way to distinguish between a response to a CHANNEL
   command and a UID CHANNEL command, therefore clients MUST NOT issue a
   UID CHANNEL command while a CHANNEL command is in progress.
   Conversely, clients MUST NOT issue a CHANNEL command while a UID
   CHANNEL command is in progress.  These restrictions are in addition
   to the normal sequencing rules that apply to UID-style commands.

   Servers MUST NOT send an EXPUNGE response while responding to a
   CHANNEL command, however a server MAY send an EXPUNGE response during
   a UID CHANNEL command.

4.  Formal Protocol Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as defined in [ABNF], and incorporates by
   reference the Core Rules from that document.  This syntax extends the
   grammar specified in [IMAP4].

   The following tokens are incorporated from [URI]: absoluteURI,
   scheme.

                          ; adds <channel-data> to <response-data>

   uid                 =/ channel



5.  Security Considerations

   It is assumed that the IMAP server and its cooperating client share
   an authorization (and authentication) namespace.

Appendix A.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the IMAP capabilities registry to add the
   CHANNEL capability defined by this memo.

Appendix B.  Administrivia

   [This appendix will not appear in the final document.]

   Discussion concerning this draft should be directed to the
   <lemonade@ietf.org> mailing list.

Appendix C.  Document Revision History

   [This appendix will not appear in the final document.]

Appendix C.1  Changes in draft -02

   1.  Revert text to that from draft-nerenberg-imap-channel-01, which
       again forms the baseline document for the specification.  The
       usage and implementation guide will be split out into another
       memo seperate from the specification itself.

   2.  Revert to the simple string "channel" for the capability.  The
       old scheme (channel=foo,bar) required parsable capabilities.  A
       new command (CHANNELSCHEMES) is proposed for discovering the
       supported scheme list.

   3.  The grammar has been cleaned up and synced with RFC3501.

   4.  References to schemes in the protocol no longer include the
       trailing ":" in the scheme name (e.g.  we now use "ftp" rather
       than "ftp:").  The grammar is now unambiguous with reference to
       the use of <scheme> and <absoluteURI> (a scheme name cannot
       contain a ":", and an <absoluteURI> requires one).  Both types
       are now encoded as <astring>.

   5.  Document reformatted to meet the latest RFC Editor's
       requirements.

   6.  Added a CHANNELSCHEMES command, used to discover the schemes
       supported by the server.


Appendix D.  Outstanding Issues

   [This appendix will not appear in the final document.]

   1.  The Security Considerations section needs to be expanded.

   2.  Examples need a seperate section.
