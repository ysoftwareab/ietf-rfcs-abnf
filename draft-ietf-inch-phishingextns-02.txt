Abstract

   This document extends the INCH XML incident reporting format for
   reporting phishing, fraud, other types of electronic crime, and
   widespread spam attacks and incidents.  Although the term "phishing
   attack" is used, the data format extensions are flexible enough to
   support information gleaned from activities throughout the entire
   phishing life cycle and extensible enough to be used for other types

   of electronic crime incidents, along with simple spam.  The
   extensions support very simple reporting as well as optional fields
   for detailed, forensic reports, and supports single phish/fraud
   incidents as well as consolidated reports of multiple phish
   incidents.

Internet-Draft        IODEF Fraud Report Extensions         October 2005


1.  Introduction

   Deception activities on the Internet, such as receiving an email
   purportedly from a bank requesting you to confim your account
   information, are an expanding attack type in the Internet.  For this
   document, the two terms phishing and fraud are used interchangeably
   and characterize as broadly-launched social engineering attacks in
   which an electronic identity is misrepresented in an attempt to trick
   individuals into revealing their personal credentials ( e.g.,
   passwords, account numbers, personal information, ATM PINs).  A
   successful phishing attack on an individual allows the phisher (i.e.,
   attacker) to exploit the individual's credentials for financial or
   other gain.  Early phishing attacks were directed at individuals via
   email as a ruse from a bank security department, requesting the
   user's ATM number and PIN.  Once phished, the bank account could be
   used by the phisher to perpetrate additional fraud, money laundering,
   or plain emptying of the account.  As individuals became more aware
   of phishing tactics, the phishers have evolved into using more
   complex and stealthier technologies, and have targeted institutions
   such as ISPs and corporations other than banks.  Other miscreants are
   also using these same techniques for other types of Internet attacks.

1.1.  Why a Common Report Format is Needed

   The rise in phishing and fraud activities via e-mail, instant
   message, DNS corruption, and malicious code insertion has driven
   corporations, Internet Service Providers, consumer agencies, and
   financial institutions to begin to collect and correlate phishing
   attack information.  The data collected allows them to better plan
   out mitigation activities and to initiate or assist in prosecution of
   the attacker.  Early on it became obvious that a common format for
   the data reported or exchanged between these parties was necessary.
   The IETF INCH XML format was selected for this use as it was already
   becoming a standard way of sharing this type of information.
   Although originally designed for network-layer incident sharing
   (e.g., DoS attacks, compromised computers) the INCH format can be
   extended quite easily to support other incident profiles, as we show
   in this document.

   The use of a common format will help organizations integrate multiple
   product outputs into a cohesive single attack view.  It will also
   allow for the introduction of advanced services such as wholly
   automatic local notifications and usable data mining.

   The accumulation and correlation of information is very important
   when dealing with security incidents.  In phishing attacks
   specifically, the attack source may be misrepresented or forged. the
   targeted organization may not even be aware of the ongoing attack.

Internet-Draft        IODEF Fraud Report Extensions         October 2005


   Third parties aware of the attack may wish to notify the targeted
   organization or a central notification service.  The targeted
   organization's internal monitoring systems may also detect the attack
   and wish to take mitigation steps.  Without this document, there is
   no recognized standard format to express the detection of a phishing
   attack or to exchange detailed information about it.  For an
   organization that employs multi anti-phishing technologies,
   correlating data from multiple vendors or products is close to
   impossible as the data is reported in multiple, mostly incompatible,
   formats.

   This document defines a data format extension to IODEF that is used
   to capture relevant information from a phishing attack and shared,
   correlated, or to populate a database.  Additionally, the use of
   products that export information in this format will allow an
   organization to correlate and analyze phishing information across
   their organization.  Although targeted at both the accumulation of
   phishing attack information from a single institution and a means of
   sharing attack information between cooperating parties, the actual
   information sharing process and related political challenges are not
   covered in this document.

1.2.  Relation to the INCH IODEF Data Model

   Instead of defining report format and language from scratch, the
   phishing activities information is encoded as XML extensions to the
   Incident Object Description Exchange Format Data Model [IODEF].  The
   use of this already existent and operational format, based on the
   Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format [IDMEF], allows for
   quicker vendor adoption and reuse of existing tools in organizations.
   To reduce duplication and to be compatible with forward modifications
   to the base IODEF definitions, this document only identifies
   additional structures necessary for exchnaing phishing and e-crime
   information.

   The goal of using a common format is to be simple and efficient, and
   to support additional data to be included to provide a complete
   picture of the event, when necessary.  One criticism of the IODEF
   format is that it is too cumbersome (i.e., large and complex) to be
   used in an efficient manner for something as simple as fraud events.
   The IODEF format has very few required elements to allow for
   efficiency, but allows extremely verbose elements to be used if
   supporting data is available.  This flexibility allows the IODEF
   formats to be used in a wide range of event reports but only requires
   the product developer to support one format standard.

Internet-Draft        IODEF Fraud Report Extensions         October 2005


1.2.1.  The IODEF Extensions for Fraud

   In general, an IODEF incident report contains detailed incident-
   specific data which populates an EventData Structure.  That data is
   then incorporated, either singularly or in aggregation, with
   additional summary and contact data, into an Incident structure.

   A Fraud Activity Report is an instance of an XML IODEF-Document with
   added EventData and AdditionalData elements.  It contains the
   Incident structure and additional fields in the EventData specific to
   phishing and fraud (the PhraudReport).  Phishing activity may include
   multiple email, instant message, or network messages, scattered over
   various times, locations, and methodologies.  The new EventData
   fields are combined into a Fraud Activity Report and includes
   information about the email header and body, details of the actual
   phishing lure, correlation to other attacks, and details of the
   removal of the web server or crdential collector.  As a phishing
   attack may generate multiple reports to an incident team, the Fraud
   Activity Reports may be combined into one EventData structure.
   Multiple EventData structures may be combined into one Incident
   Report.  And one IODEF Incident report ma record one or more
   individual phishing events and may include multiple EventData
   elements.

   This document defines new attributes for the EventData and Record
   Item IODEF XML elements and identifies the Fraud Activity Report
   required attributes.  The Appendices contain sample Fraud Activity
   Reports and a complete Schmea and Document Type Definition.

   The IODEF Extensions defined in this document comply with section4,
   "Extending the IODEF Format" in [IODEF].

   Internet-based Phishing and Fraud activities are normally comprised
   of at least four components.

   1.  The Phisher, Fraudster, or party perpetrating the fraudulent
   activity.  Most times this party is not readily identifiable.

   2.  The Attack Source, where the phishing email, virus, trojan, or
   other attack is generated.

   3.  The User, Victim, or intended target of the fraud/phish.

   4.  The collection point, where the victim sends their credentials or
   personal data if they have been duped by the phisher.

   If we take a holistic view of the attack, there are some additional
   components:

   5.  The sensor, which is something that detects the fraud/phish
   attempt or success.  This element may be an intrusion detection
   system, firewall, filter, email gateway, or human.

   6.  A forensic or archive site where an investigator has copied or
   otherwise retained the data used for the fraud attempt or credential
   collection.

3.  Fraud Actvitiy Reporting via an IODEF-Document Incident

   A Fraud Activity Report is an instance of an XML IODEF-Document with
   added EventData, AdditionalData elements.  The added elements compose
   a PhraudReport Element.  Required information with many optional
   items are populated into the PhraudReport structure to form a Fraud
   Activity Report.  To facilitate completeness, the report originator
   should fill out all mandatory items and as many as necessary optional
   Incident element fields, to stay consistent with the IODEF-Document
   structure.

   This document defines new EventData IODEF XML elements; then
   identifies attributes that are required in a compliant Fraud Activity
   Report.  The Appendices contain sample Fraud Activity Reports and the
   complete XML Document Type Definition and schema.

   The Incident element with fraud extensions is summarized below.  It
   provides a standardized representation for commonly exchanged
   incident data and associates a CSIRT assigned unique identifier with
   the described activity.

   of phishing and fraud-related information that does not map to
   existing Incident or EventData attributes.  Some additional
   attributes are defined to capture electronic mail header and routing
   information.

   One Incident report may contain information on multiple incidents.
   After the report identification information listed in the Incident
   element, each individual event is detailed within a single EventData
   structure.

4.  PhraudReport Element Definitions

   A PhraudReport consists of an extension to the Incident
   AdditionalData Element.  The elements of the PhraudReport will
   identify and capture information related to the four components of
   fraud activity.  Other forensic information and commentary can be
   added by the reporter as necessary to show relation to other events,
   the output of an investigation, or for archival purposes.  A
   PhraudReport element is structured as follows.

   +--------------------------+
   | EventData.AdditionalData |
   +--------------------------+
   | ENUM type (9 = xml)      |<>---------[ PhraudReport ]

   document.

4.2.  Identifying A Fraud campaign

   At times it may be useful to identify a specific phish or fraud for
   future analysis, much like the Anti-Virus Vendors identify certain
   viruses.  A specific phish/fraud activity can be identified using a
   combination of the FraudType, FraudParameter, and PhishRefName
   elements.

4.2.1.  FraudType Parameter

   ENUM.  The FraudType attribute contains a number representing the
   type of fraud attempted.  The Email element has been separated into
   multiple numbers to support the primary types of email.

   1.  PhishEmail, and the FraudParameter is the email subject line of
   the phishing email.  This type is a standard email phish, usually
   sent as spam, and is intended to derive financial loss to the
   recipient.

   2.  RecruitEmail, and the FraudParameter is the email subject line of
   the phishing email.  This type of email phish does not pose a
   potential financial loss to the recipient, but covers other cases of
   the phish and fraud lifecycle.

   3.  MalwareEmail, and the FraudParameter is the email subject line of
   the phishing email.  This type of email phish does not pose a
   potential financial loss to the recipient, but lures the recipient to
   an infected site.

   4.  Fraudsite, no FraudParameter.  This identifies a known fraudulent
   site that does not necessarily send spam lures.

   5.  DNSspoof, with the malware name as a parameter.  This is used for
   a spoofed DNS (e.g., malware changes localhost file so visits to
   www.example.com go to another IP address).

   6.  Keylogger, with the malware name as the FraudParameter.

   7.  OLE, no parameter.  This identifies background Microsoft Object
   Linking and Embedding (OLE) information.

   8.  IM.  The subject line parameter may be the malicious instant
   message (IM) link supplied to the user.

   9.  CVE, with the Common Vulnerability and Exposures project (CVE)
   number as the FraudParameter.

   10.  SiteArchive, with the data archived from the phishing server



Cain & Jevans              Expires May 4, 2006                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        IODEF Fraud Report Extensions         October 2005


   placed in the ArchiveInfo element.

   11.  Spamreport.  This type is used when the PhraudReport is
   reporting a large-scale spam activity.  The FraudParameter should be
   the spam email subject line.

   12.  Unknown.

   When a FraudParameter is required, it is one of the following values:

   SubjectLine element

       STRING.  This is the subject line of the email lure.Note that
       some phishers add a number of random characters onto the end of a
       phish email subject line for uniqueness; reporters should delete
       those characters before insertion into the PhishParameter field.

   MalwareName element

       STRING.  This is the name of the malware that installed the
       keylogger or DNSspoofer.

   CVENumber element

       STRING.  This is the CVE identifier of this exploit used to
       phish.

4.2.2.  LureSource Element

   SOURCE.  Many times the phishing, spam, or fraud lure email is
   received from a spoofed IP address.  If the real IP Address can be
   ascertained it should be populated into this field.  A spoofed
   address may also be entered, but the spoofed attribute SHALL be set.
   The field is an IODEF Source element to capture the Address and to
   allow for support of IPv6 and port numbers.  An additional text
   string is provided to capture domain or host information at the time
   of the event.

4.2.3.  PhishNameRef Element

   STRING.  This value is a friendly-name for this fraud event.  It may
   be agreed upon by vendor collaboration to note a common name for a
   given phish attack or "campaign".  The agreed upon identifier could
   be useful in collaboration, support, media and public education.

4.2.4.  PhishNameLocalRef Element

   STRING.  Many contributors will have a local reference name or

   Unique-IDentifier (UID) that will be used before a commonly agreed
   term is adopted in PhishNameRef.  This field allows a cross-reference
   from the submitting organization's system to the central repository.

4.3.  FraudedBrandName Element

   STRING.  This is the identifier of the recognized brandname or
   company name used to launch the phishing activity.  Some schemes,
   such as those enticing "mules" for money laundering or related
   activities, may use a lesser known or fictitious brand [e.g., xyz
   semiconductor company].  Those brand identifiers should also populate
   this field.

4.4.  The Data Collection Site Element (DCSite)

   This section captures the type, identifier, collection location, and
   other pertinent information about the credential gathering process by
   the fraudster.  The data collection site is identified by three
   elements: the type of collector activity, what type of collector
   site, and the network address of the collector site (i.e., URL, IP
   address, etc).

   If the DCSite element is present, the DCSiteType element is required.
   Multiple DCSiteData elements are allowed.

   +------------------+

4.4.1.  DCType Parameter

   ENUM.  This element identifies the method of data collection, as
   determined by analyzing the victim computer, lure, or malware, and
   are selected from the following list.  This element is coupled with
   the DCSiteData element to identify the data collection site.

   in the DataCollectionSiteData element.

      1.  Web. Data from the victim is collected on a website.  The
      website URL is included in the DCSitePointer.

      2.  Email.  The victim emails credentials to the collection site.
      The email server DNS name is in the DCSitePointer.

      3.  IODEF.SOURCE Element.  This collection site uses other
      protocols to gather data from the victim.  The DCSitePointer field
      is an IODEF Source Element, holding the IP Version Protocol,
      IPAddress, and Port number of the collection site.  The Protocol
      field defaults to TCP, if absent.

      4.  Unknown.  The DCSitePointer data should be verbose.

4.5.  OriginatingSensor Element

   The OriginatingSensor element contians the identification and
   cognizant data of the network element that detected this fraud
   activity.  Note that the network element does not have to be in the
   Internet itself (i.e., it may be a local IDS system) nor is it
   required to be mechanical (e.g., humans are allowed).

   Multiple Originating Sensor Elements are allowed.

4.5.5.  Location Element

       STRING.  This is an optional location of the sensor.

4.6.  TakeDownInfo Element

   This element identifies the agency(s) that performed the removal or
   ISP-blockage of the phish or fraud collector site.  A PhraudReport
   may have multiple TakeDownInfo elements to support activities where
   multiple agencies are active.  Note that the term "Agency" is used to
   identify any party performing the blocking or removal such as ISPs or
   private parties, not just government entities.

   populated when, for example, an ISP takes down a phisher's web site
   and has copied the site data into an archive file.  There are three
   types of archives currently supported, as specified in the type
   field.

4.7.1.  Type Parameter

   This parameter specifies the contents of the archive.

       1.  Data Collection Site.

       2.  Basecamp Site.

       3.  Sender Site.

       4.  Unspecified.

4.7.2.  ArchivedDataURL Element

       URL.  This is the URL where the gzip archive file is located.
       [As archives are quite large, a Fraud Report just points out
       where the archive is, and does not include it in the report.]

4.7.3.  ArchivedDataComments Element

       STRING.  This field is a free form area for comments on the
       archive and/or URL.

4.8.  RelatedData Element

   URL.  This element allows the listing of other web or net sites that
   are related to this incident (e.g., victim site, etc).

4.9.  CorrelationData Element

   PhraudReport that does not fit in any other field.

4.11.  EmailRecord Element

   Extensions are also made to the INCH IODEF Incident EventData element
   to support descriptive information received in phishing lure or spam
   emails.  The ability to report spam is included within a PhraudReport

   to support exchanging information about large-scale spam activities,
   not necessarily a single spam message to a user.  As such the spam
   reporting mechanism was not designed to minimize overhead and
   processing.

   Information related to the overall fraudulent activity is contained
   within the PhraudReport, while the EmailRecord element is used to
   capture forensic or detailed technical information about a specific
   attack.  Incident Reports may have none, one, or multiple
   EmailRecords as its goal is to accumulate pertinent technical data
   associated with an specific attack as an investigation continues.

4.11.1.  EmailCount Element

       NUMBER.  This field enumerates the number of email messages
       identified in this record detected by the reporter.

4.11.2.  EmailHeader Element

       STRING.  The headers of the phish email are included in this
       element as a sequence of one-line text strings.  There SHALL be
       one EmailHeader element per mailRecord

4.11.3.  EmailBody Element

       STRING.  This element contains the body of the phish email.  If
       present, there should be at most one EmailBody element per
       EmailRecord

4.11.4.  EmailComments Element

       STRING.  This field contains comments or relevant data not placed
       elsewhere about the phishing or spam email.

5.  IODEF Required Elements

   A report about fraud, spam, or phishing requires certain identifying
   information which is contained within the standard IODEF Incident
   data structure.  The following table identifies attributes required
   to be present in a compliant PhraudReport.  The required attributes
   are a combination of those required by the base IODEF element and
   those required by this document.  Attributes identified as required
   SHALL be populated in conforming phishing activity reports.

   The following table is a visual description of the IODEF and
   PhraudReport required fields.

5.3.  Guidance on Usage

   It may be apparent that the mandatory attributes for a phishing
   activity report make for a quite sparse report.  As incident
   forensics and data analysis require detailed information, the
   originator of a PhraudReport should include any tidbit of information
   gleaned from the attack analysis.  Information that is considered
   sensitive can be marked as such using the restriction parameter of
   each data element.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies the format of security incident data.  As
   such, the security of transactions containing the incident report
   will vary from organization to organization.  We do not want to
   burden the information exchange with unnecessary encryption
   requirements, as the transport service for the data exchange may
   provide adequate protections, or even encryption.  The use of
   encryption is expected to be agreed upon on originator-recipient
   agreement.

   The critical security concern is that phishing activity reports may
   be falsified or the report may become corrupt during transit.  In
   areas where transmission security or secrecy is necessary the
   application of a digital signature and/or message encryption on each
   report will counteract both of these concerns, The digital signature
   may be overkill for most activity report users as the goal is to
   notify others of the event.  For this reason, phishing activity
   reports MAY be digitally signed with the optional IODEF XML
   signature, although we expect that each receiving entity will
   determine the need for this signature independently.

   Recipients of fraud reports SHALL be prepared to accept XML digitally
   signed reports and SHOULD support receiving encrypted reports.
