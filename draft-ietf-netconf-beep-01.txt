Internet-Draft             NETCONF over BEEP                   June 2004


1. Introduction

    The NETCONF protocol [1] defines a simple mechanism through which a
    network device can be managed. NETCONF is designed to be usable over
    a variety of application protocols. This document specifies an
    application protocol mapping for NETCONF over the Blocks Extensible
    Exchange Protocol (BEEP) [2] .

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

1.1 Why BEEP?

    Use of BEEP is natural as an application protocol for transport of
    XML.  As a peer to peer protocol, BEEP provides an easy way to
    implement NETCONF, no matter which side of the connection was the
    initiator.  This "bidirectionality" allows for either side to play
    the role of the manager with no protocol changes. Either side can
    open a channel.  Either side could initiate an RPC.  This is
    particularly important to support operational models that involve
    small devices connecting to a manager, and those devices that must
    reverse the management connection in the face of firewalls and NATs.

    The SASL profile used by BEEP allows for a simple and direct mapping
    to the existing security model for CLI, while TLS provides a strong
    well tested encryption mechanism with either server or server and
    client-side authentication.

2. BEEP Transport Mapping

    All NETCONF over BEEP implementations MUST implement the profile and
    functional mapping between NETCONF and BEEP as described below.

2.1 NETCONF Session Initiation

    Managers may be either BEEP listeners or initiators.  Similarly,
    agents may be either listeners or initiators.  Thus the initial
    exchange takes place without regard to whether a manager or the agent
    is the initiator.  After the transport connection is established, as
    greetings are exchanged, they should each announce their support for
    TLS [5] and optionally SASL [4] (see below), as well as for the
    SYSLOG profile [6]. Once greetings are exchanged, if TLS is to be
    used and available by both parties, the listener STARTs a channel
    with the TLS profile.

    Once TLS has been started, a new greeting is sent by both initiator
    and listener, as required by the BEEP RFC.

    At this point, if SASL is desired, the initiator starts BEEP channel
    1 to perform a SASL exchange to authenticate itself.  When SASL is
    completed, the channel MUST be closed.

    Once authentication has occurred, there is no need to distinguish
    between initiator and listener.  We now distinguish between manager
    and agent.

    The manager now establishes an NETCONF a new
    &dquot;operational&dquot; channel for capabilitiesexchange and
    requests and responses.  As initiators assign odd channels and
    listeners assign even channels, this next channel is BEEP channel 1
    or 2, depending on whether the manager is the initiator or the
    listener.

    Certain NETCONF capabilities may require additional BEEP channels.
    When such capabilities are defined, a BEEP mapping must be defined as
    well.

    At this point, the NETCONF session is established.

2.2 NETCONF RPC Execution

    To issue an RPC, the manager transmits on the operational channel a
    BEEP MSG containing the RPC and its arguments.  In accordance with
    the BEEP standard, RPC requests may be split across multiple BEEP
    frames.

Internet-Draft             NETCONF over BEEP                   June 2004


    Once received and processed, the agent responds with BEEP RPYs on the
    same channel with the response to the RPC.  In accordance with the
    BEEP standard, responses may be split across multiple BEEP frames.

2.3 NETCONF Session Teardown

    Either side may initiate the termination of an NETCONF session.  In
    This is done by issuing a BEEP close on channel 0 after the current
    RPC has completed.  Having sent or received a BEEP close, a manager
    MUST NOT send further requests, and an agent MUST NOT send additional
    responses.  If there are additional activities due to expanded
    capabilities, these MUST cease in an orderly manner, and should be
    properly described in the capability mapping.

2.4 BEEP Profile for NETCONF

    The operations channel will have two commands, <rpc> and <rpc-reply>.

3. Security Considerations

    Configuration information is by its very nature sensitive.  Its
    transmission in the clear and without integrity checking leaves
    devices open to classic so-called "person in the middle" attacks.
    Configuration information often times contains passwords, user names,
    service descriptions, and topological information, all of which are
    sensitive. A NETCONF application protocol, therefore, must minimally
    support options for both confidentiality and authentication.

    BEEP makes use of both transport layer security and SASL.  We require
    that TLS be used in BEEP as described by the BEEP standard.
    Client-side certificates are strongly desirable, but an SASL
    authentication is the bare minimum.  SASL allows for the use of
    protocols such as RADIUS [9], so that authentication can occur off
    the box.

    SASL authentication will occur on the first channel creation, and
    prior to issuance of any protocol operations. No further
    authentication may occur during the same session.  This avoids a
    situation where rights are different between different channels.  If
    an implementation wishes to support multiple accesses by different
    individuals with different rights, then multiple sessions are
    required.

    Different environments may well allow different rights prior to and
    then after authentication.  Thus, an authorization model is not
    specified in this document.  When an operation is not properly
    authorized then a simple "permission denied" is sufficient. Note that
    authorization information may be exchanged in the form of
    configuration information, which is all the more reason to ensure the
    security of the connection.
