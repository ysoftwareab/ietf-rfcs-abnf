Abstract

   This document defines an 'untypedObject' structural object class for
   the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and X.500.  This is
   useful for entries with no 'natural' choice of structural object
   class, e.g. if an entry must exist even though its contents are
   uninteresting.

INTERNET-DRAFT     LDAP object class 'untypedObject'           June 2004


1. Introduction

   An entry in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC3377]
   or [X.500] directory must have a structural object class, such as
   'person' or 'country'.  However, an entry may lack a 'natural' choice
   of structural object class.  For example, the desired structure of a
   directory tree might require an entry to exist even though it
   describes no real-world object.  This document defines an
   'untypedObject' structural object class for this use.

1.1. Related: 'namedObject'

   (This section will be deleted in the final RFC.)

   A related structural object class is 'namedObject' of the currently
   expired Internet-Draft [Named].  This is for use "when no other
   structural object class is available".  Its rationale is entries
   whose function is supplied by an auxiliary object class like
   posixGroup [RFC2307].

   This draft avoids including that purpose of the object class, to
   avoid stepping on [Named]'s author's toes.  Maybe it should instead
   include that purpose, and rename the object class accordingly.


2. Object class definition

   untypedObject is defined as follows.  The definition uses the BNF
   form of ObjectClassDescription from [RFC2252], but with lines folded
   for readability.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID NAME 'untypedObject'
        DESC 'Entry of no particular type [RFC XXXX]'
        SUP top STRUCTURAL
        MAY ( c $ cn $ dc $ l $ o $ ou $ st $ street $ uid $
              description $ owner $ seeAlso $
              enhancedSearchGuide $ searchGuide ) )

   The attribute types are defined in [RFC2256], except for 'dc' in
   [RFC2247] and 'uid' in [RFC2798].

   The name of an entry with this object class will normally be a cn,
   but attributes c through uid are allowed as well in case the entry
   name relates to the name of something else.  Of these, only the one
   used for naming is intended to be used in the entry.  Use of the
   others may be an indication that the entry should have a more
   descriptive object class instead of or in addition to this one.

3. Example

   In a directory with entries named as follows, the entries with RDNs
   cn=people etc. can use untypedObject:

                  uid=john,cn=people,dc=example,dc=com
         uid=john,cn=users,cn=system,dc=example,dc=com
      cn=www,cn=filegroups,cn=system,dc=example,dc=com


4. Security Considerations

   This document raises no known security issues.


5. IANA Considerations

   It is requested that the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   register the following upon Expert Review:

      Subject: Request for LDAP OID Registration
      Person & email address to contact for further information:
         Hallvard B Furuseth <h.b.furuseth@usit.uio.no>
      Specification: RFC XXXX
      Author/Change Controller: IESG
      Comments:
         OID of structural object class 'untypedObject'.  It should be
         below 1.3.6.1.1, according to BCP 64 (RFC 3383) section 3.1.
         [Editor: I don't know if last sentence is necessary.]

      Subject: Request for LDAP Descriptor Registration
      Descriptor (short name): untypedObject
      Object Identifier: IANA-ASSIGNED-OID
      Person & email address to contact for further information:
         Hallvard B Furuseth <h.b.furuseth@usit.uio.no>
      Usage: Object class
      Specification: RFC XXXX
      Author/Change Controller: IESG
      Comments:
         Structural object class for entries of no particular type.

   [Editor: Here and in Section 2, replace IANA-ASSIGNED-OID with the
   assigned OID and XXXX with the RFC number assigned this document.]

6. Appendix A: Notes on choices made for the object class

   (This section will be deleted in the final RFC.)

   The c through uid attributes (for naming of entries) match the table
   of naming attributes in [RFC2253] (UTF-8 String Representation of
   Distinguished Names), in case the entry's RDN needs to match the RDN
   of something else.

   The description, owner and seeAlso attributes seem good to offer for
   "nothing in particular"-kind of entries, since such entries might not
   contain anything else which indicates what they are for and who is
   responsible for them.

   The enhancedSearchGuide and searchGuide attributes are for entries
   used as base objects of subtrees.


7. Appendix B: Issues for consideration

   (This section will be deleted in the final RFC.)

   Is this object class too general, and should be renamed to something
   like 'subtreeBase' instead?

   Or is it not general enough for an object class as general as this,
   and should also cover what Luke Howard's upcoming 'namedObject'
   covers (section 1.1)?

   Is the choice of naming attributes good?  It could be expanded, or
   reduced to just cn, or maybe cn, dc and uid.
