NAME=VALUE
      REQUIRED.  The name of the state information ("cookie") is NAME,
      and its value is VALUE.  NAMEs that begin with $ are reserved and
      MUST NOT be used by applications.

      The VALUE is opaque to the user agent and may be anything the
      origin server chooses to send, possibly in a server-selected
      printable ASCII encoding.  "Opaque" implies that the content is of
      interest and relevance only to the origin server.  The content
      may, in fact, be readable by anyone that examines the Set-Cookie2
      header.

Comment=value
      OPTIONAL.  Because cookies can be used to derive or store private
      information about a user, the value of the Comment attribute
      allows an origin server to document how it intends to use the
      cookie.  The user can inspect the information to decide whether to
      initiate or continue a session with this cookie.  Characters in
      value MUST be in UTF-8 encoding. [RFC2279]

CommentURL="http_URL"
      OPTIONAL.  Because cookies can be used to derive or store private
      information about a user, the CommentURL attribute allows an
      origin server to document how it intends to use the cookie.  The
      user can inspect the information identified by the URL to decide
      whether to initiate or continue a session with this cookie.

Domain=value
      OPTIONAL.  The value of the Domain attribute specifies the domain
      for which the cookie is valid.  If an explicitly specified value
      does not start with a dot, the user agent supplies a leading dot.

Max-Age=value
      OPTIONAL.  The value of the Max-Age attribute is delta-seconds,
      the lifetime of the cookie in seconds, a decimal non-negative
      integer.  To handle cached cookies correctly, a client SHOULD
      calculate the age of the cookie according to the age calculation
      rules in the HTTP/1.1 specification [RFC2616].  When the age is
      greater than delta-seconds seconds, the client SHOULD discard the
      cookie.  A value of zero means the cookie SHOULD be discarded
      immediately.

Path=value
      OPTIONAL.  The value of the Path attribute specifies the subset of
      URLs on the origin server to which this cookie applies.

Version=value
      REQUIRED.  The value of the Version attribute, a decimal integer,
      identifies the version of the state management specification to
      which the cookie conforms.  For this specification, Version=1
      applies.
