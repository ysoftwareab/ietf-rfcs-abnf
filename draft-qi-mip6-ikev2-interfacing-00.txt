Internet-Draft        Integration of IKEv2 & MIPv6             July 2007


Abstract

   This draft discusses the issues associated with interfacing between
   IKEv2/IPsec and MIPv6.  When mobile nodes bootstrap in foreign
   network or handover to a new network, IKEv2/IPsec can not probe the
   changing of care-of-address, which is related security associations.
   One simple extension to the SADB_ACQUIRE in PF_KEY framework is
   proposed to support this interfacing.  And the operation modification
   of IKEv2 and MIPv6 are described in this proposal based on the
   SADB_ACQUIRE extension.  A new mobility security reference database
   is created to store the temporary mobility parameters.

Internet-Draft        Integration of IKEv2 & MIPv6             July 2007


1.  Introduction

   IP security (IPsec) [RFC4301] framework could provide security
   services for traffic at IP layer.  Internet Key Exchange v2 (IKEv2)
   [RFC4306] protocol is designed to negotiate IPsec security
   association (SA) between two end-to-end nodes, which are also called
   initiator and responder.

   IKEv2 protocol is a protocol which consists of two exchanges:

   (1) An authentication and key exchange protocol to establish IKE-SA.
   This is also called IKEv2 INIT procedure

   (2) The protocol with some payloads for negotiation IPsec security
   associations (i.e., Child-SAs).  These payloads contain security
   algorithm parameters and traffic selector fields.  This is the IKEv2
   AUTH procedure, which is protected by IKE-SA

   In addition to the above-mentioned parts IKEv2 also includes some
   payloads and messages which allow configuration parameters to be
   exchanged primarily for remote access scenarios.

   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)[RFC3775] allows the mobile nodes(MN) to maintain
   the reachability while moving in the IPv6 network.  After
   registration to home agent(HA), the packets destined to MN could be
   routed correctly by using the end-to-end tunnel, while MN is away
   from the home network.  According the specification in [RFC3775], the
   MIPv6 signaling messages and optinally data packets should be
   protected by IPsec in transport mode or tunnel mode.  While MN
   changes its IP point of attachment, the survival of related IPsec SAs
   must be maintained.

   IPsec has two related databases: Security Policy Database (SPD) is
   the place to store the requirements of IP security; Security
   Association Database (SAD) is the warehouse for all the SAs.  PF_KEY
   interface is a socket protocol used by key management entities (such
   as IKEv2) to communicate with OS kernels for internal security
   management.  MIPv6 entity could use PF_KEY interface to populate its
   security requirements in SPD and get the SA parameters in SAD.
   [RFC2367].

   This document describes the seamless interfacing solution between
   IKEv2/IPsec and MIPv6.  A new simple PF_KEY extension is proposed to
   support the smooth MIPv6 operation with the IPsec framework and
   IKEv2.  We extended the SADB_ACQUIRE message in PF_KEY framework.  A
   new mobility security reference database is created to store the
   temporary mobility parameters.  It's a key reference database for
   IKEv2 entity to update the SAs in SAD and IKE internal parameters,

   while MN moves to another network.

   While this solution could support the seamless interworking between
   IKEv2/IPsec and MIPv6, it is easy to be applied to IKEv1/IPsec
   [RFC2409] framework.

2.  Requirements on IKEv2 and MIPv6 integration

   The MN and the HA must use an IPsec SA to protect the integrity and
   authenticity of the Binding Updates and Acknowledgements.  [RFC4877]
   specifies the dynamic keying requirements which applies to
   IKEv2[RFC4306] for BU/BA between MNs and HAs.  The transport SA
   between MN and HA should base on Home Address (HoA) of MN for survial
   of SA after the Care-of Address (CoA) is changed.  This is because
   the Home Address (HoA) is unrecheable before registration during the
   bootstrapping phase in foreign network.

   Tunnel mode ESP is needed for Home Test Init (HoTi), Home Test (HoT)
   messages and optionally payload packets.  Since the MN may change its
   attachment point to the Internet, it is necessary to update its
   endpoint address of the IPsec SAs using tunnel mode.  The IKEv2
   entities should dynamically update these SAs when the MN moves.  In
   order to realize this, IKEv2 entity should be notified by Mobile IPv6
   daemon with necessary information to modify the related SAs.

   As time goes by, the IPsec SA and IKE SA may expire and need to
   rekey.  But MN would have some new CoAs, if it roams to other
   networks.  So it is required to make IPsec SA rekey process by using
   MN's current address.

   This document proposes the new mobility security reference database
   (MSRD) and extension to PF_KEY socket to support the following
   functions for IKEv2/IPsec and MIPv6 interfacing:

   (1) Provision of related MIPv6 parameters for IKEv2 during
   bootstrapping phase in foreign network.

   (2) Interfacing between MIPv6 and IKEv2 to update the related SAs
   when MN does handover to another network.

   (3) Provision of related MIPv6 parameters for rekey of IKEv2/IPsec.

   This proposal only requires very simple extension (SADB_ACQUIRE
   extension) to the existing PF_KEY API.  It could support the seamless
   interfacing between MIPv6 and IKEv2/IPsec with minimum modification
   of related softwares.

3.  Mobile Security Reference Database (MSRD)

3.1.  the structure of MSRD

   MSRD is the database for mobility security reference.  MIPv6 deamon
   will store the mobility related paramters in this database.  The
   information in this database should only be accessible for OS kernel
   and related key management deamons (such as IKEv2, etc.).
   Considering the structure, MSRD could be disigned as a table indexed
   by mobile protocol index (MPI).

   Every table entry should include at least the current CoA, HoA, HA
   address and lifetime.  Some other information could also be included
   to support other interworking functions (such as redundant SA
   negotiation) between IKEv2/IPsec and MIPv6.

3.2.  MSRD APIs

   MSRD should support some basic APIs, but not limited to for table
   operation,

   uint64 MSRD_ADD(HoA, HA, CoA, lifetime, ...)

      the return value is the MPI for the added MSRD entry

   uint64 MSRD_DELETE(HoA, HA, CoA, lifetime, ...)

      the return value is the MPI for the deleted MSRD entry

   uint64 MSRD_GETMPI(HoA, HA, CoA, lifetime, ...)

      the return value is the MPI of MSRD entry whose parameters match
      the API arguments

   uint8 MSRD_QUERY(MPI, *HoA, *HA, *CoA, *lifetime, ...)

      Get the mobility related information from MSRD indexed by MPI.
      The return values are defined as below:

      0 - success, 1 - entry not found by MPI, 2 - table unaccessible

   uint8 MSRD_UPDATE(MPI, HoA, HA, CoA, lifetime, ...)

      update the mobility related information in MSRD indexed by MPI.
      The return values are defined as below:

      0 - success, 1 - entry not found by MPI, 2 - table unaccessible

4.  Overview of the extension to PF_KEY interface

   The definition of SADB_ACQUIRE message in is shown below

   < base, address(SD), address(P)*, identity(SD)*, sensitivity*

   proposal >

   * means optional payload

   The SADB_ACQUIRE message is typically sent by the kernel to key
   socket listeners who have registered their key socket (Such as the
   IKEv2 deamon).  SADB_ACQUIRE messages also can be sent by
   application-level consumers of security associations.  In this
   document, MIPv6 can send this message to kernal for security services
   of MIPv6 signaling and payload traffic.

   In the proposal, the SADB_ACQUIRE message is extended as below:

   < base, address(SD), address(P)*, identity(SD)*, sensitivity*,

   proposal, ref* >

   * means optional payload

   The definition of SADB_X_REF for 'ref' in the message is described
   below:

           struct sadb_x_ref {
                   uint8_t  sadb_ref_ver;       //version
                   uint8_t  sadb_ref_type;      //type
                   uint16_t sadb_ref_type_ext;  //sub type
                   uint16_t sadb_ref_len;       //length
                   uint16_t sadb_ref_reserved;  //length
                   uint64_t sadb_ref_mpi;       //index in MSRD
                           };  /* SADB_X_REF header */
           /* sizeof(struct sadb_x_ref) == 32 */

           sadb_ref_type
                   Type of this extension,
                   0 means originated from APP,
                   1 means originated from kernel

           sadb_ref_sub_type
                   Sub-type of this extension,
                   0 is reserved for MIPv6 usage

           sadb_ref_mpi

   Mobility related information is needed for IKEv2 deamon to negotiate
   the IPsec SAs.  MIPv6 deamon stores all the required mobility
   parameters in the MSRD, which is indexed by mobile protocol index
   (MPI).  This MPI must be included in the SADB_X_REF extension of
   SADB_ACQUIRE message from MIPv6 deamon to the kernel.  This message
   will be delivered to registered key management deamon (IKEv2). then,
   IKEv2 deamon could get the mobility related parameters (such as CoA,
   redundent HA, etc) from MSRD by using the sadb_ref_mpi field in the
   SADB_ACQUIRE message from kernel.

   The brief procedure is described as below:

      1.  MIPv6 deamon add or update the MSRD entries when it handover
      to a new network;

      2.  MIPv6 deamon update the related SPD entries based on the
      related mobility parameters;

      3.  MIPv6 deamon sends SADB_ACQUIRE message with SADB_X_REF
      extension to the IPsec sub-system in kernel.  Inside this message,
      the MPI should be included.  The kernal will check its integrity
      and deliver it to IKEv2 deamon;

      6.  Upon receiving this SADB_ACQUIRE message from kernel, IKEv2
      deamon will query the MSRD by MPI to get the mobility related

      parameters (such as CoA, etc);

      7.  IKEv2 deamon will update the tunnel mode SAs in the SAD based
      on the information in MSRD and SPD.  It will also update the
      related parameters inside IKEv2 deamon (such as IKE SA, etc);

   The BU/BA re-registration in same network will not trigger MIPv6
   deamon to send the SADB_ACQUIRE messages

5.3.  How to do Re-key of IPsec/IKE security associations (SA)

   When the MIPv6-related IPsec SAs in SAD expire, IPsec sub-system in
   kernel will send SADB_EXPIRE message to IKEv2 deamon.  In this case,
   IKEv2 should know the mobility related information in MSRD.  The
   straightforward way is to store the related MPI in IKEv2 deamon.  So
   upon receiving the SADB_EXPIRE message from kernel, IKEv2 could get
   information MSRD by MPI directly and update the related SAD.  This
   procedure is depicted in the picture below.

                          2.Query

   If IKEv2 deamon does not store the MPI for mobility SAs, the OS
   kernal need to query the MSRD based on the information in SAs.  After
   it gets the MPI, kernel could encapsulate it in SADB_X_REF extension
   of SADB_EXPIRE to IKEv2 deamon.  In this case, the SADB_EXPIRE should
   be extended to support the SADB_X_REF extension.  This could follow
   the same way of SADB_ACQUIRE extension in this documents.  The
   picture below describes this case.

      1. while the mobility-related SAs IPsec sub-system Kernel will
      query MSRD based on the content of BU to get the MPI;

      2.  Kernel puts the MPI in SADB_X_REF extension, builds and sents
      the SADB_EXPIRE message to IKEv2 deamon;

      3.  Upon receiving this SADB_EXPIRE message from kernel, IKEv2
      deamon will query the MSRD by MPI to get the mobility related
      parameters (such as CoA, etc);

      4.  IKEv2 deamon will rekey the related SA in SAD;

6.  Summary on the modification of related softwares

6.1.  The modification of IKEv2 software

   IKEv2 daemon should be able to extract MPI from SADB_X_REF payload.
   It should be able to retrieve the mobility related parameters from
   MSRD by MPI or SA parameters.  It should support the capability to
   set up the specific IPsec SAs in mobile environment or to modify
   IPsec SAs when receiving extended SADB_ACQUIRE message in this
   documents.  It should be able to rekey the specific IPsec SAs in
   mobile environment when receiving extended SADB_EXPIRE message in
   this docuemtn.

6.2.  The modification of MIPv6 software

   Mobile Ipv6 should be able to write and index the mobility
   information in the MSRD that can be read by OS kernel, IKEv2 daemon
   or any other related key management deamons.  Mobile Ipv6 should send
   extended PF_KEY SADB_ACQUIRE message with SADB_X_REF to kernel.  This
   is the notification of MN's roaming to new network.

6.3.  The modification of OS kernel

   Kernel should be able to recognize SADB_X_REF payload and to deal
   with it.  It should be able to add this payload in SADB_ACQUIRE
   message and optionally SADB_EXPIRE message.  In some cases, OS kernel
   should support the MSRD query API for IPsec SA rekey.

7.  Security Considerations

   The MSRD should be only accessible for MIPv6 deamon, OS kernel and
   related key management deamons (such as IKEv2).  Only MIPv6 deamons
   could have the full manipulation right on MSRD.  MSRD is read-only
   for all the other softwares.  Besides this point, there is no other
   security issues for consideration introduced by this documents.

8.  Conclusion

   In this documents, the simple PF_KEY extension is proposed to support
   the full seamless interworking between IKEv2/IPsec and MIPv6.  A new
   SADB_X_REF extension is created for SADB_ACQUIRE message and
   optionally SADB_EXPIRE message in PF_KEY framework.  The basic target
   for this extension is to provide the mobility related information in
   the cases of bootstrap in Foreign network, handover to a new network
   and IPsec SA rekey.  The proposal in this document incurs small
   modification on the softwares of IKEv2, MIPv6 and OS kernel.
