              Bulk Subscription to YANG Event Notification
          draft-wang-netconf-bulk-subscribed-notifications-03

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model and associated mechanism that
   allows subscriber applications to bulk subscribe to publishers' event
   streams based on bundle group information such as bundle size and
   bundle latency.  This allows the publishers to report multiple
   notifications in a single bundling message.

1.  Introduction

   Subscription to YANG Notifications for Datastore Updates [RFC8641]
   uses a "target" object in subscription protocol operation for
   identifying the targeted source of information against which the
   subscription is applied and supports multiple subscriptions on a
   single transport session.  Notification Message Headers and Bundles
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-notification-messages] allows multiple
   notifications bundled into one transportable message.  However the
   subscription protocol operation doesn't provide specific criteria to
   classify subscriptions and therefore lacks the capability to
   explicitly indicate which specific subscription associated with the
   notification should be bundled together, e.g., subscription A and B
   are bundled based on their relationship with a set of YANG data
   models while subscription C and D are bundled based on "transport"
   and "encoding" parameters,both bundled groups are transported in the
   same transport session.  A bundle size, bundle latency associated
   with a set of subscriptions or YANG data models enables the ability
   to perform encapsulation operation on a set of subscriptions with
   common characteristics via a single transaction.  The bundle size and
   bundle latency provides a more optimal mechanism for notification
   encapsulation which would otherwise require multiple atomic
   transactions on a per subscription (i.e., one message per
   notification) basis.  Following are some of the use-cases where such
   identifier can be used.

   o  For a dynamic subscription, the subscriber may have already had
      priori knowledge about correlation relation between

      subscriptions(e.g., aggregated subscribed data from multiple
      sources).  With this priori knowledge,it might send a bundle
      subscription RPC request to indicate what specific notifications
      associated with the subscription must be bundled together.

   o  For a configured subscription, self-explanation data Node tag
      capability advertisment describing correlation between data nodes
      in different YANG data model from different publisher can be used
      to further establish correlation relation between subscriptions.
      The correlation relation between subscriptions can be configured
      back onto publisher, which help determine which notifications can
      be bundles and which notifications are not.

   o  With the above bundle subscription indication from subscriber to
      the publisher, multiple notifications corresponding to the request
      protocol operation for those notifications are bundled into one
      transportable message using Notification Message Headers and
      Bundles defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-notification-messages].

   This document defines a YANG data model and associated mechanism that
   classify subscription based on various different filtering criteria
   and allow subscriber applications to bulk subscribe/unsubscribe to
   publisher's targeted object source based on bundle size and bundle
   latency.  This also allows the publishers to report multiple
   notification in a single bundling message defined in [I-D.ietf-
   netconf-notification-messages].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the following terms:

   Event:  An event is something that happens that may be of interest -
      a configuration change, a fault, a change in status, crossing a
      threshold, or an external input to the system, for example.
      Often, this results in an asynchronous message, sometimes referred
      to as a notification or event notification, being sent to
      interested parties to notify them that this event has occurred
      [RFC5277].

   Client:  Defined in [RFC8342].

   Configuration:   Defined in [RFC8342].

   Configured subscription:  Defined in [RFC8639]

   Configuration datastore:    Defined in [RFC8342].

   Event record:   A set of information detailing an event [RFC8639].

   Event stream:   A continuous, chronologically ordered set of events
      aggregated under some context [RFC8639].

   Notification message:   Information intended for a receiver
      indicating that one or more events have occurred [RFC8639].

   Publisher:  An entity responsible for streaming notification messages
      per the terms of a subscription [RFC8639].

   Receiver:  A target to which a publisher pushes subscribed event
      records.  For dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber
      are the same entity [RFC8639].

   Subscriber:   A client able to request and negotiate a contract for
      the generation and push of event records from a publisher.  For
      dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber are the same
      entity [RFC8639].

   Subscription:  A contract with a publisher, stipulating the
      information that one or more receivers wish to have pushed from
      the publisher without the need for further solicitation [RFC8639].

2.  Model Overview

   The YANG data model for the Bulk Subscriptions to YANG Event
   Notification has been split into two modules:

   o  The ietf-bulk-subscription.yang module defines a list for
      classifying different subscriptions corresponding to target object
      into groups.  Each group is associated with a bundle size, bundle
      latency and a set of subscriptions.  A set of subscription is
      identified by a "group-id" string.  This string is used both as an
      index within the bulk subscription module.  It associate a
      specific bundle group with a group of subscriptions and a set of
      YANG data models, as shown in the subscription augmentation.  In
      addition,ietf-subscribed-notifications.yang module defined in
      [RFC8639] is augmented with "max-bundle-size","max-bundle-latency"
      and "compression-algorithm" to enhance QoS feature and provide
      additional subscription bundle classification criteria.

   o  The ietf-bulk-notification.yang module augment the YANG structure
      of ietf-notification-messages.yang [draft-ietf-netconf-

      notification-messages], a "group-id" is added to the "message-
      header" of the ietf-notification-messages.yang to indicate the
      group to which a set of notifications belongs.  In addition,
      "compression-algorithm" parameter is augmented to "message-header"
      to inform the corresponding recievers of compression algorithm to
      be used by the publisher.

   The following tree diagrams [RFC8340] provide an overview of the data
   model for "ietf-bulk-subscription.yang" module and the "ietf-bulk-

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive in some
   network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these
   data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /bundle-groups/bundle-group/group-id

   o  /sn:subscriptions/sn:subscription/bs:max-bundle-latency

   o  /sn:subscriptions/sn:subscription/bs:max-bundle-size

   o  /bundle-subscription/input/group-id
