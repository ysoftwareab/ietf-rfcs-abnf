Abstract

   This document updates RFC 5761 by clarifying the SDP offer/answer
   negotiation of RTP and RTCP multiplexing.  It makes it clear that an
   answerer can only include an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in an SDP answer
   if the associated SDP offer contained the attribute.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 5761 [RFC5761] specifies how to multiplex RTP data packets and
   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets on a single UDP port, and how to
   negotiate usage of such multiplexing using the SDP offer/answer
   mechanism [RFC3264], using an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute.  However, the
   text is unclear on whether an answerer is allowed to include the
   attribute in an answer even if the associated offer did not contain
   an attribute.

   This document updates RFC 5761 [RFC5761] by clarifying that an
   answerer can only include an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in an answer if
   the associated offer contained the attribute.  It also clarifies that
   the negotiation of RTP and RTCP multiplexing is for usage in both
   directions.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Update to RFC 5761

   This section updates section 5.1.1 of RFC 5761.

3.1.  Update to the sixth paragraph of section 5


 OLD TEXT:

  When the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [8] is used to negotiate
  RTP sessions following the offer/answer model [9], the "a=rtcp-mux"
  attribute (see Section 8) indicates the desire to multiplex RTP and
  RTCP onto a single port.  The initial SDP offer MUST include this

  attribute at the media level to request multiplexing of RTP and RTCP
  on a single port.  For example:

      v=0
      o=csp 1153134164 1153134164 IN IP6 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e
      s=-
      c=IN IP6 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e
      t=1153134164 1153137764
      m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 97
      a=rtpmap:97 iLBC/8000
      a=rtcp-mux

  This offer denotes a unicast voice-over-IP session using the RTP/AVP
  profile with iLBC coding.  The answerer is requested to send both RTP
  and RTCP to port 49170 on IPv6 address 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e.

  If the answerer wishes to multiplex RTP and RTCP onto a single port,
  it MUST include a media-level "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in the answer.
  The RTP payload types used in the answer MUST conform to the rules in
  Section 4.

  If the answer does not contain an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute, the offerer
  MUST NOT multiplex RTP and RTCP packets on a single port.  Instead,
  it should send and receive RTCP on a port allocated according to the
  usual port-selection rules (either the port pair, or a signalled port
  if the "a=rtcp:" attribute [10] is also included).  This will occur
  when talking to a peer that does not understand the "a=rtcp-mux"
  attribute.

  When SDP is used in a declarative manner, the presence of an "a=rtcp-
  mux" attribute signals that the sender will multiplex RTP and RTCP on
  the same port.  The receiver MUST be prepared to receive RTCP packets
  on the RTP port, and any resource reservation needs to be made
  including the RTCP bandwidth.


 NEW TEXT:

  When the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [8] is used to negotiate
  RTP sessions following the offer/answer model [9], the "a=rtcp-mux"
  attribute (see Section 8) indicates the desire to multiplex RTP and
  RTCP onto a single port, and the usage is always negotiated for both
  directions.

  If the offerer wishes to multiplex RTP and RTCP onto a single port,
  the initial SDP offer MUST include the attribute at the media level to
  request multiplexing of RTP and RTCP on a single port. For example:

      m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 97
      a=rtpmap:97 iLBC/8000
      a=rtcp-mux

  This offer denotes a unicast voice-over-IP session using the RTP/AVP
  profile with iLBC coding.  The answerer is requested to send both RTP
  and RTCP to port 49170 on IPv6 address 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e.

  If the offer contains the "a=rtcp-mux" attribute, and if the answerer
  wishes to multiplex RTP and RTCP onto a single port, it MUST include a
  media-level "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in the answer. The RTP payload
  types used in the answer MUST conform to the rules in Section 4. If
  the offer does not contain the "a=rtcp-mux" attribute the answerer
  MUST NOT include an attribute in the answer, and the answerer MUST NOT
  multiplex RTP and RTCP packets on a single port.

  If the answerer includes an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in the answer, the
  offerer and answerer MUST multiplex RTP and RTCP packets on a single
  port.

  If the answer does not contain an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute, the offerer
  and answerer MUST NOT multiplex RTP and RTCP packets on a single port.
  Instead, they should send and receive RTCP on a port allocated
  according to the usual port-selection rules (either the port pair, or
  a signalled port if the "a=rtcp:" attribute [10] is also included).
  This will occur when talking to a peer that does not understand the
  "a=rtcp-mux" attribute.

  When SDP is used in a declarative manner, the presence of an "a=rtcp-
  mux" attribute signals that the sender will multiplex RTP and RTCP on
  the same port.  The receiver MUST be prepared to receive RTCP packets
  on the RTP port, and any resource reservation needs to be made
  including the RTCP bandwidth.


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for RTP and RTCP multiplexing are
   described in RFC 5761.  This specification does not impact those
   security considerations.
