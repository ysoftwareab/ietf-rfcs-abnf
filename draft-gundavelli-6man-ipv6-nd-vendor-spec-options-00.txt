               IPv6 ND Vendor-Specific Information Option
        draft-gundavelli-6man-ipv6-nd-vendor-spec-options-00.txt

Abstract

   The current IPv6 Neighbor Discovery specification does not provide
   semantics for carrying vendor-specific options in the IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery messages.  With the anticipated wide scale deployment of
   IPv6 networks, it is useful for organizations and vendors to have the
   ability to carry organization/vendor specific information in the IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery messages.  This will facilitate the vendors and
   organizations to make deployment specific extensions as needed in
   system deployment.  This document defines a new vendor-specific
   information option that can be carried in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   messages exchanged between IPv6 nodes on a link.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 ND Vendor-Specific Option        February 2010


1.  Introduction

   Support for Vendor-specific options in protocol messages have proven
   to be extremely useful in the development and the deployments of
   protocols.  The Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775], DHCPv6 [RFC3315], IKEv2
   [RFC4306] and many other protocols have provided the needed semantics
   for constructing and carrying vendor-specific options in their
   respective protocol messages.  These options have allowed vendors to
   implement customary extensions to protocols and distinguish
   themselves from other vendors.  These extensions with proper name
   space ensured interoperability and coexistence with other
   implementations.  A given implementation always had the option to
   simply skip a vendor specific option when it did not recognize the
   vendor ID present in the received option.

   Enabling this capability does not take away the fact that vendors are
   encouraged to bring their extensions to IETF and move it through the
   standards process.  However, it is also important to provide the
   needed tools for vendors to extend protocols when the extensions are
   very much local to a given deployment and global standardization of
   those extensions are not needed.

   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery specification [RFC4861] defines various
   messages for communication between IPv6 nodes on a link.  However,
   the protocol does not currently support vendor specific options.
   This document defines a new vendor-specific information option that
   can be carried in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages exchanged between
   IPv6 nodes on a link.

2.  Requirements Language

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "OPTIONAL",
   "RECOMMENDED", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC2119].

3.  Vendor-Specific Information Option

   A new option, Vendor-Specific Information Option is defined.  This
   option is used by IPv6 Neighbor Discovery peers to exchange vendor-
   specific information.  This option can be included in any of the IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery messages.

   The definition of the information carried in this option is vendor
   specific.  The vendor is indicated in the enterprise-number field.
   Use of vendor-specific information allows enhanced operation,
   utilizing additional features in a vendor's IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   implementation.  Multiple instances of the option can be present in a
   Neighbor Discovery message.  The option should be padded to ensure it
   ends on a natural 64-bit boundary.

4.  Processing Rules

   The following considerations MUST be applied by all IPv6 nodes when
   sending and receiving any Neighbor Discovery messages with Vendor-
   Specific Information option.

   o  When including a Vendor-Specific Information option in a Neighbor
      Discovery message, general considerations from [RFC4861] MUST be
      applied on the rules of inclusion of options in Neighbor Discovery
      messages.  Additionally, if the node is a SEND [RFC3971] node, the
      Vendor-Specific Information option MUST precede the RSA Signature
      option [RFC3971].

   o  If there is a Vendor-Specific Information option present in the
      received Neighbor Discovery message, but if the vendor Id is
      unknown, the option SHOULD be silently ignored and the rest of the
      message must be processed.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a new Neighbor Discovery option, Vendor-
   Specific Information Option.  This is defined in Section 3.0.  The
   type value for this option needs to be assigned from the registry,
   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats, defined in [RFC4861].

6.  Security Considerations

   The Vendor-Specific Information option defined in this specification
   is carried in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages, like any other
   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery option and does not require any special
   security considerations.  However, Neighbor Discovery messages are
   vulnerable to threats mentioned in [RFC3756].  These threats can be
   mitigated by the use Secure Neighbor Discovery [RFC3971].
