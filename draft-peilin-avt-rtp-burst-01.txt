Internet-Draft          Extension for Rapid Synch             March 2009


1.  Introduction

   Both "Extensions to RTCP Feedback Mechanism for Burst Streaming"
   [I-D.levin-avt-rtcp-burst] and "Unicast-Based Rapid Synchronization
   with RTP Multicast Sessions"
   [I-D.versteeg-avt-rapid-synchronization-for-rtp] introduce some
   reasons, such as the key information to appear in the stream, for a
   synchronization delay while joining a multicast group to receive
   video multicast streaming in a random point in time.  These reasons
   are main factors affecting the experience of multicast session
   synchronization.

   It is clear that the IETF needs to define a method to solve these
   reasons and improve multicast session synchronization which can be
   used to extend the existing RTP and RTCP mechanisms.  This document
   proposes extensions for rapid synchronization multicast session based
   on RTP control protocol(RTCP) to improve the experience of multicast
   session and reduce synchronization time when a receiver wishes to
   join another multicast session.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Rapid Synchronization Mechanism Description

   The real-time transport protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] provides video
   delivery services with real-time characteristics, such as video
   broadcasts in which receivers can frequently switch among different
   multicast sessions.  In order to achieve rapid synchronization and
   reduce the synchronization delay between multicast sessions, a cached
   Retransmission Server (RS) is employed to send an accelerated unicast
   streaming to the requesting Receiver and temporarily replace the
   multicast session.

   The set of new extended RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Messages
   defined in this document is designed to support rapid synchronization
   mechanism as described below:

   1) Receiver sends a rapid synchronization request for the new channel
   and at the same time to request to cease all the data streams of the
   current unicast channel if it is being used.  This request is sent in
   an extended RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Message "RTCP Rapid
   Synchronization Request (RSR)", which is defined in the Section 4.1.
   The extended RTCP message includes the SSRC of the media source of



Yang, et al.            Expires September 9, 2009               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          Extension for Rapid Synch             March 2009


   the current channel that should stop and the SSRC of media source of
   the new channel.  The receiver indicates that it needs to receive
   media streaming with the key information "as soon as possible" using
   the default Bitrate on the first RSR request by sending the new
   extended RTCP RSR Message to the Retransmission Server.  Later, an
   adaptive Bitrate will be used for the following RTCP RSR Message
   requests.  The Adaptive Bitrate will be adjusted based on receiver's
   feedback of network transportation situation.
   Note that since no RTP packets have been received yet for this
   session, the SSRC should be obtained out-of-band.

   2) Retransmission Server receives the RTCP RSR Message, and decides
   whether to accept it or not.  The Retransmission Server sends a new
   extended RTCP Message "RTCP Rapid Synchronization Indication" (RSI)
   to the Receiver.  This new RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Message
   "RTCP Rapid Synchronization Indication" (RSI) is defined in
   Section 4.2.  The RTCP RSI Message contains the result of Rapid
   Synchronization Request, First sequence number of the unicast stream
   and the expected minimum interval of the extend RTCP Transport Layer
   Feedback Message "RTCP Synchronization Rate Adaptation (SRA)".

   Note that when Retransmission Server Receives RTCP RSR Message, it
   MUST also disable all the data streams of the current channel
   provided to the Receiver.  For example, the Retransmission Server
   should cancel the earlier pending rapid synchronization operation or
   stop the ongoing synchronization operation by ceasing the relevant
   unicast burst media stream of the current channel.  The
   retransmission service for the current channel provided to the
   receiver also SHOULD be disabled.

   3) If Retransmission Server grants the rapid synchronization request,
   it transmits the unicast media stream of the new channel to Receiver
   at an accelerated rate.

   4) Since it receives the unicast burst media stream, Receiver can
   test for a maximum optimal network speed for the burst media stream
   transfer.  The method for testing the maximum optimal network speed
   is based on the receiving packets of unicast burst media stream.  If
   there is no packet loss or stationary loss, it indicates that higher
   bitrate is possible.  It indicates that lower bitrate is necessary if
   packet loss is higher.  The Receiver will make its feedback to
   Retransmission Server by sending a new extended RTCP Message "RTCP
   Synchronization Rate Adaptation (SRA)" according to the result of the
   maximum optimal network speed test, and give a Proposed Adaptive
   Bitrate.  This new RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Message "RTCP
   Synchronization Rate Adaptation (SRA)" is defined in Section 4.3.

   5) Receiving the RTCP SRA Message, the Retransmission Server adjusts



Yang, et al.            Expires September 9, 2009               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          Extension for Rapid Synch             March 2009


   its current transmitting bitrate to the maximum optimal bitrate
   according to the RTCP SRA Message proposal of the Receiver and the
   current condition of Retransmission Server.

   6) Once unicast burst media stream is synchronized with multicast
   media stream(that is to say, the unicast burst media catches up with
   Real-time multicast media stream, Retransmission Server first
   decreases its transmitting bitrate to a lower rate, and then sends
   the RTCP Message "RTCP Synchronization Completed Notification (SCN)"
   to instruct the Receiver to join the multicast session.  This new
   RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Message "RTCP Synchronization Completed
   Notification (SCN)" is defined in Section 4.4.

   7) After the Receiver receives the RTCP SCN Message, it immediately
   sends multicast session join message to start receiving real-time
   multicast media stream.

   8) When the Receiver receives the multicast RTP flow, it sends the
   RTCP Message "RTCP Synchronization Completed Response (SCR)" to the
   Retransmission Server to ask to terminate the unicast burst media
   stream.  This new RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Message "RTCP
   Synchronization Completed Response (SCR)" is defined in Section 4.5.
   The RTCP SCR message contains the first sequence number of the
   multicast RTP flow.

   Note that during the burst unicast streaming, either the loss of key
   information or data of random access point should cause the receiver
   join the new multicast session.  Whereafter, the receiver sends RTCP
   Message "RTCP Synchronization Completed Response (SCR)", which
   includes the reason of termination, to the Retransmission Server to
   request for ceasing the current burst unicast.

   9) When the Retransmission Server receives the first sequence number
   of the multicast RTP flow, it will transmit the unicast media stream
   until the first sequence number.

   10) When the Receiver requests to switch to a second channel, the
   rapid synchronization request message - the RTCP Transport Layer
   Feedback Message "RTCP Rapid Synchronization Request (RSR)" shall use
   the previous optimal bitrate for optimal rapid Synchronization of
   multicast session.

   Note that when the Receiver requests to switch to a second channel,
   there may be an earlier rapid synchronization operation that is
   pending or active.  If the Receiver does not receive unicast burst
   media stream.  So RTCP RSR message shall use the default bitrate.  If
   the Receiver has received unicast burst media stream, RTCP RSR
   message shall use the actual bitrate by measuring the burst unicast

   media stream.


3.  Rapid Synchronization Mechanism Flow

   The flow diagram for rapid synchronization mechanism is illustrated
   in Figure 1.  This mechanism can be implemented using the extensions
   of RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Messages defined in this document.
   In this rapid synchronization mechanism, it can be supported by
   sending video streaming based on unicast with key information from
   Retransmission Server to Receiver.  In the meantime, Retransmission
   Server will adjust to the optimal maximum sending bitrate in terms of
   network situation based on Receiver's feedback.

4.  The format of new extended RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Messages

   This section defines the format of new RTCP Transport Layer Feedback
   Messages that are exchanged between the Retransmission Server and
   Receiver during rapid synchronization.

4.1.  RTCP Rapid Synchronization Request(RSR)

   The RTCP RSR Request message is identified by PT=RTPFB and FMT=5.

   The RTCP RSR Request is mandatory.

   The RTCP RSR Request is used by Receiver to request rapid
   synchronization for a new multicast RTP session and to request for
   ceasing all data streams associated with the current channel provided
   to the receiver .

   The RTCP RSR field has the structure depicted in Figure 2.

                    Figure 2: Syntax for the RSR messag

   Default Bitrate/Adaptive Bitrate

   The Default Bitrate/Adaptive Bitrate field is four octets.  The
   Default Bitrate indicated by Receiver at the first time to request
   rapid synchronization, it depends on the Receiver's configuration.
   Adaptive Bitrate: Adaptive Bitrate is used when the Receiver requests
   a second rapid synchronization.  It is the final adaptive bitrate of
   previous rapid synchronization.  The Adaptive Bitrate will be
   adjusted dependence on network transportation situation.  The Default
   Bitrate/Adaptive Bitrate must be higher than multicast bitrate.

   SSRC of Current Unicast Burst

   The SSRC of Current Unicast Burst field is four octets.  The SSRC of
   unicast burst indicates the unicast burst media stream of the current
   channel.  This field is used to request Retransmission Server to
   cease the unicast burst media stream of the current channel.

4.2.  RTCP Rapid Synchronization Indication(RSI)

   The RTCP RSI Indication message is identified by PT=RTPFB and FMT=6.

   The RTCP RSI field has the structure depicted in Figure 3.

       1 for Success

       2 for Failure

   Min SRA Interval Flag (I): 1 bit

   When theMin SRA Interval Flag Bit is set to 1, the Min SRA Interval
   field indicates the interval in number of packets.  Otherwise, when
   the Min SRA Interval Flag Bit is set to 0,the Min SRA Interval field
   indicates the time interval.  Its default value is set to 0.

   Reserved

   The Reserved fields are one octet and are set to zero on
   transmission, and ignored on reception.

   Reason-type

   The Reason-type field is two octets.  The Reason-type field depends
   on the Result field.  This field defines the initial set of
   successful type when the Result field set to 1 (Success).  In the
   meantime, this field also defines the initial set of failure reason
   when the Result field set to 2 (Failure).

   for Success Result:

       1 for joining the multicast session immediately

       2 for waiting for notification to join multicast session

   First Unicast Sequence Number

   The First Unicast Sequence Number field is two octets.  The First
   Unicast Sequence Number field indicates the first packet that will be
   sent as part of the rapid synchronization.  This field allows
   Receiver to know if one or more packets are dropped at the beginning
   of rapid synchronization.  The First Unicast Sequence Number field is
   constructed by putting the 16-bit RTP sequence number.

   Min SRA Interval

   The Min SRA Interval field is two octets.  The Min SAR Interval field
   specifies the allowed minimum time/packet number before sending a
   Synchronization Rate Adaptation(SAR).  If theMin SRA Interval Flag
   Bit is set to 0, it is in units of 1/10 second.  Otherwise, the Min
   SRA Interval field indicates the interval in number of packets.  If
   network situation is unstable, Receiver will send the RTCP SAR

   number of the "Min SRA Interval").  When transmitting bitrate reach a
   stable state - maximum optimal bitrate, Receiver will send the RTCP
   SAR Message at longer interval and even won't send.

4.3.  RTCP Synchronization Rate Adaptation(SRA)

   The RTCP SAR Request message is identified by PT=RTPFB and FMT=7.

   The RTCP SRA field has the structure depicted in Figure 4.

   Proposed Adaptive Bitrate

   The Proposed Adaptive Bitrate field is four octets.  The Proposed
   Adaptive Bitrate field indicates that the final optimum rate of
   transportation is used from Retransmission Server to Receiver.  It
   gradually adjusts the bitreate that Reveive can receive.  If there is
   no packet loss or stationary loss, it indicates that higher bitrate
   is possible.  It indicates that lower bitrate is necessary if packet
   loss is higher.

   Number of packets lost

   The Number of packets lost field is two octets.

   Period of packets lost

   The Period of packets lost field is two octets.  It is in units of
   1/10 second.

4.4.  RTCP Synchronization Completed Notification(SCN)

   The RTCP SCN notification indication message is identified by
   PT=RTPFB and FMT=8.

   The RTCP SCN field has the structure depicted in Figure 5.

   Final Optimal Adaptive Bitrate

   The Final Optimal Adaptive Bitrate field is four octets.  The Final
   Optimal Adaptive Bitrate field indicates the final optimal
   transmission rate from Retransmission Server to Receiver.  Receiver
   can use this rate to request subsequent Rapid Synchronization.

4.5.  RTCP Synchronization Completed Response(SCR)

   The RTCP SCR response message is identified by PT=RTPFB and FMT=9.

   The RTCP SCR field has the structure depicted in Figure 6.

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Type

       1 for the response of joining the multicast session immediately

       2 2 for indicating either key information or data of random
       access point of the current burst unicast media stream get lost
       and requesting to cease the current burst unicast media stream
       for the associated multicast session that the Receiver is going
       to join.

   When the Type field is set to 1.  It indicates that the Receive
   responses the type of joining the multicast session immediately

   When the Type field is set to 2.  It indicates that either key
   information or data of random access point of the current burst
   unicast media stream get lost,the receiver requests the
   Retransmission Server to cease the current burst unicast media stream
   for the associated multicast session that the Receiver is going to
   join .

   Note that when the Type field is set to 2.  The SSRC field in RTCP
   extension feedback message indicates the SSRC of burst unicast media
   stream for the associated multicast group that the Receiver is going
   to join.

   Reserved

   The Reserved fields are three octets and are set to zero on
   transmission, and ignored by the receiver.

   First Multicast Sequence Number

   The First Multicast Sequence Number field is two octets.  When the
   Type field is set to 1, the First Multicast Sequence Number field
   indicates the first sequence number received from the multicast
   stream.  When Retransmission Server receives the message, it sends
   unicast stream until First Multicast Sequence Number.

   When the Type field is set to 2, the First Multicast Sequence Number
   is set to 0x0.
