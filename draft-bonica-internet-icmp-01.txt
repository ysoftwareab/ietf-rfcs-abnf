Internet-Draft               Extending ICMP                 January 2006


1.   Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].


2.  Introduction

   This document defines a syntax that can be used to extend ICMPv4 [2].
   In this document, the term ICMP refers exclusively to ICMPv4.  Unless
   explicitly noted, ICMPv6 is NOT discussed in this memo.

   The syntax defined in this document MUST NOT be used to extend
   ICMPv6.  This syntax was designed to be backwards compatible with
   currently deployed, MPLS-aware ICMPv4 implementations.  Consequently,
   the syntax is not as clean as would be desirable.  For ICMPv6, where
   there are no similarly deployed implementations, a better format
   should be created.  However, other than this note, ICMPv6 is beyond
   the scope of this memo.

   The syntax defined herein is characterized by an extension structure
   that is appended to selected ICMP messages.  The extension structure
   contains an extension header followed by one or more objects.  Each
   object contains an object header and a payload.  All object headers
   share a common format.

   This document addresses a fundamental problem in ICMP extensibility.
   Many ICMP messages, as currently defined, end with a variable-length
   field that lacks a length attribute.  Application software infers the
   length of this final field from the total length of the ICMP message.
   If an extension structure were appended to these messages, without
   adding a length attribute for the variable-length field, application
   software would not be able to parse the ICMP message.  Specifically,
   application software would not be able to determine where the
   variable-length field ends and where the extension structure begins.

   The current memo also addresses backwards compatibility with existing
   ICMP implementations that either do not implement the extensions
   defined herein or implement them without adding the required length
   attributes.  In particular, this draft addresses backwards
   compatibility with certain, widely deployed, MPLS-aware ICMP
   implementations that send the extensions defined herein without
   adding the required length attribute.

   However, the current memo does not define any ICMP extension objects.
   It defines only the extension header and a common header that all
   objects share.

3.  The ICMP Extension Structure

   This memo proposes an optional ICMP Extension Structure that can be
   appended to any ICMP message, except for those that are disqualified
   in Section 5.5 of this document.

   The Extension Structure contains exactly one Extension Header
   followed by one or more objects.  Having received an ICMP message
   with extensions, application software MAY process selected objects
   while ignoring others.  The presence of an unrecognized object does
   not imply that an ICMP message is malformed.

   As stated in RFC 792, the total length of the ICMP message, including
   extensions, MUST NOT exceed 576 octets.  Figure 1 depicts the ICMP
   Extension Header.



       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |Version|      (Reserved)       |           Checksum            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Figure 1: ICMP Extension Header

   The fields of the ICMP Extension Header are as follows:

   Version: 4 bits

      ICMP extension version number.  This is version 2.

   Reserved: 12 bits

      Must be set to 0.

   Checksum: 16 bits

      The one's complement of the one's complement sum of the data
      structure, with the checksum field replaced by zero for the
      purpose of computing the checksum.  An all-zero value means that
      no checksum was transmitted.

      If the checksum field contains a value other than described above,
      the ICMP message does not include the extensions described in this
      memo.  However, due to backwards compatibility, this does not
      imply that the ICMP message is malformed.  See for Section 6
      details.

4.  ICMP Extension Objects

   Each extension object contains one or more 32-bit words, representing
   an object header and payload.  All object headers share a common
   format.  Figure 2 depicts the Object Header and payload.

      |                                                               |
      |                   // (Object payload) //                      |
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Figure 2: Object Header and Payload

   An object header has the following fields:

   Length: 16 bits

      Length of the object, measured in octets, including the object
      header and object payload.

   Class-Num: 8 bits

      Identifies object class.

   C-Type: 8 bits

      Identifies object sub-type.


5.  ICMP Extensibility

   RFC 792 defines the following ICMP message types:

      - Destination Unreachable

      - Time Exceeded

      - Parameter Problem

Internet-Draft               Extending ICMP                 January 2006


      - Source Quench

      - Redirect

      - Echo Request/Reply

      - Timestamp/Timestamp Reply

      - Information Request/Information Reply

   RFC 1191 [3] adds a "Next-Hop MTU" field to the Destination
   Unreachable message.  Subsequent RFCs define the following messages:

      - Address Mask Request/Reply [5]

      - Router Solicitation/Advertisement [6]

      - Traceroute [7]

      - Domain Name Request/Reply [8]

      - Security Failure [9]

      - Experimental Mobility [10]

   Many ICMP messages are extensible as currently defined.  Protocol
   designers can extend ICMP messages by simply appending fields or data
   structures to them.

   The following ICMP messages are not extensible as currently defined:

      - Destination Unreachable

      - Source Quench

      - Time Exceeded

      - Parameter Problem

      - Redirect

      - Echo Request

      - Echo Reply

      - Domain Name Reply

   These ICMP messages contain a field which represents a portion of the
   original datagram to which the ICMP messages is a response.  As
   originally defined, this field includes the IP header plus the next
   eight octets of the original datagram.  RFC 1812 [4] extends this
   field to contain as many octets as possible, without exceeding a
   limit of 576 octets for the entire ICMP message.

   Unfortunately, the above mentioned field lacks a length attribute.
   Application software infers the length of this field from the total
   length of the ICMP message.  If an extension structure were appended
   to the ICMP message, without adding a length attribute for the
   variable-length field, application software would not be able to
   parse the ICMP message.  Specifically, application software would not
   be able to determine where the variable-length field ends and where
   the extension structure begins.

   In order to solve this problem, this memo introduces an 8-bit length
   attribute to the following ICMP messages.

      - Destination Unreachable

      - Source Quench

      - Time Exceeded

      - Parameter Problem

   The length attribute MUST be specified when the ICMP Extension
   Structure is appended to the above mentioned ICMP messages.  It
   SHOULD be specified when the ICMP Extension Structure is not appended
   to the above mentioned ICMP messages.

   The length attribute represents the size of the associated variable-
   length field, measured in 32-bit words.  When the length attribute is
   specified, the associated variable-length field MUST be zero padded
   to the nearest 32-bit boundary.  Space for the length attribute is
   claimed from reserved octets, whose value was previously required to
   be zero.

   In order the achieve backwards compatibility, when the ICMP Extension
   Structure is appended to the Time Exceeded or Destination Unreachable
   messages, the variable-length field MUST contain at least 128 octets.
   If the orignal datagram that the variable-length field represents did
   not contain 128 octets, the variable-length field MUST be zero padded
   to 128 octets.  (See Section 6 for rationale.)

   The following sub-sections depict length attribute as it has been
   introduced to selected ICMP messages.

      |                           //                                  |
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Figure 3: Destination Unreachable

   The syntax and semantics of all fields are unchanged from RFC 792 and
   RFC 1191.  However, a length attribute is added to the second word.
   The length attribute represents length of the padded "original
   datagram" field, measured in 32-bit words.

   When the ICMP Extension Structure is appended to this message, the
   "original datagram" field MUST contain at least 128 octets (32
   words).

5.2.  Source Quench

   Figure 6: Parameter Problem

   The syntax and semantics of all fields are unchanged from RFC 792,
   except for a length attribute which is added to the second word.  The
   length attribute represents length of the padded "original datagram"
   field, measured in 32-bit words.

5.5.  ICMP Messages That Cannot Be Extended

   Due to a lack of reserved octets from which to allocate space, a
   length attribute could not be added to the following ICMP messages:

      - Redirect

      - Echo Request

      - Echo Reply

      - Domain Name Reply

   Therefore, the ICMP Extension Structure described in this memo cannot
   be used in conjunction with the above mentioned ICMP messages.


6.  Backwards Compatibility

   ICMP messages can be categorized as follows:

      - Messages that do not include any ICMP extensions

      - Messages that include partially compliant ICMP extensions

      - Messages that includes fully compliant ICMP extensions

   Any ICMP implementation can send a message that does not include
   extensions.  ICMP implementations produced prior to 1999 never send
   ICMP extensions.

   Some ICMP implementations, produced between 1999 and the present, may
   send a partially compliant version of ICMP extensions described in
   this memo.  Specifically, these implementations may append the ICMP
   Extension Structure to the Time Exceeded and Destination Unreachable
   messages.  When they do this, they send exactly 128 octets
   representing the original datagram, zero padding if required.
   However, they do not specify a length attribute to be associated with
   the "original datagram" field.

   It is assumed that ICMP implementations produced in the future will
   send ICMP extensions that are fully compliant with this
   specification.

   Likewise, applications that consume ICMP messages can be categorized
   as follows:

      - Classic applications

      - Partially compliant applications

      - Fully compliant applications

   Classic applications do not parse extensions defined in this memo.
   Partially compliant implementations parse the extensions defined in
   this memo, but only in conjuntion with the Time Expired and
   Destination Unreachable messages.  They require the "original
   datagram" field to contain exactly 128 octets and are insensitive to
   the length attribute that is associated with that field.  Partially
   compliant applications were produced between 1999 and the present.

   Fully compliant applications comply fully with the specifications of
   this document.

   In order to demonstrate backwards compatibility, Table 1 describes
   how members of each application catagory would parse each category of
   ICMP message.

                                  Table 1

   In the table above, cells that are left blank represent the nominal
   case and require no explanation.  In the following sections, we
   assume that the ICMP message type is "Time Exceeded".

6.1.  Classic Application Receives ICMP Message With Extensions

   When a classic application receives an ICMP message that includes
   extensions, it will incorrectly interpret those extensions as being
   part of the "original datagram" field.  Fortunately, the extensions
   are guaranteed to begin at least 128 octets beyond the begining of
   the "original datagram" field.  So, only those ICMP applications that
   process the 129th octet of the "original datagram" field will be
   adversely effected.  To date, no such applications have been
   identified.

6.2.  Partially Compliant Application Receives ICMP Message With No
      Extensions

   When a partially compliant application receives a message that
   contains no extensions, the application examines the total length of
   the ICMP message.  If the total ICMP message length is less than the
   length of its IP header plus 144 octets, the application correctly
   determines that the message does not contain any extensions.

   The 144 octet sum is derived from 8 octets for the first two words of
   the ICMP Time Exceeded message, 128 octets for the "original
   datagram" field, 4 octets for the ICMP Extension Header and 4 octets
   for a single ICMP Object header.  All of these octets would be
   required if extensions were present.



Bonica, et al.            Expires July 30, 2006                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft               Extending ICMP                 January 2006


   If the ICMP payload contains 144 octets or more, the application must
   examine the 137th octet to determine whether it represents a valid
   ICMP Extension Header.  In order to represent a valid Extension
   Header, it must contain a valid version number and checksum.  If it
   does not contain a valid version number and checksum, the application
   correctly determines that the message does not contain any
   extensions.

   Partially compliant applications assume that the ICMP Extension
   Structure begins on the 137th octet of the Time Exceeded message,
   after a 128 octet field representing the padded "original datagram"
   message.

6.3.  Partially Compliant Application Receives ICMP Message With Fully
      Compliant Extensions

   When a partially compliant application receives a message that
   contains fully compliant ICMP extensions, it will parse those
   extensions correctly only if the "original datagram" field contains
   exactly 128 octets.  This is because partially compliant applications
   are insensitive to the length attribute that is associated with the
   "original datagram" field.  (They assume its value to be 128.)

   Therefore, when fully compliant ICMP implementations append
   extensions to the ICMP Destination Unreachable and Time Expired
   Messages, they SHOULD restrict the "original datagram" field to its
   minimum length, 128 octets.

6.4.  Fully Compliant Application Receives ICMP Message With No
      Extensions

   When a fully compliant application receives a message that contains
   no extensions, it first examines the length attribute that is
   associated with the "original datagram" field.  If that length
   attribute is not specified, the application examines the total length
   of the ICMP message.  If the total ICMP message length is less than
   the length of the IP header plus 144 octets, the application can
   correctly determine that the message does not contain any extensions.

   The 144 octet sum is derived from 8 octets for the first two words of
   the ICMP Time Exceeded message, 128 octets for the "original
   datagram" field, 4 octets for the ICMP Extension Header and 4 octets
   for a single ICMP Object header.  All of these octets would be
   required if extensions were present.

   If the ICMP payload contains 144 octets or more, the application must
   examine the 137th octet to determine whether it represents a valid
   ICMP Extension Header.  In order to represent a valid Extension

   Header, it must contain a valid version number and checksum.  If it
   does not contain a valid version number and checksum, the application
   correctly determines that the message does not contain any
   extensions.

6.5.  Fully Compliant Application Receives ICMP Message With Partially
      Compliant Extensions

   When a fully compliant application receives a message that contains
   partially compliant extensions, it first examines the length
   attribute that is associated with the "original datagram" field.
   Because length attribute is not specified, it examines the total
   length of the ICMP message.

   Because the ICMP payload contains 144 octets or more, the application
   must examine the 137th octet to determine whether it represents a
   valid ICMP Extension Header.  In order to represent a valid Extension
   Header, it must contain a valid version number and checksum.  If it
   does not contain a valid version number and checksum, the application
   correctly determines that the message does not contain any
   extensions.


7.  Security Considerations

   Upon receipt of an ICMP message, application software must check it
   for syntactic correctness.  Improperly specified length attributes
   and other syntax problems may result in buffer overruns.

   This memo does not define the conditions under which a router sends
   an ICMP message.  Therefore, it does not expose routers to any new
   denial of service attacks.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The ICMP Extension Object header contains two 8-bit fields: The
   Class-Num identifies the object class, and the C-Type identifies the
   class sub-type.  Sub-type values are defined relative to a specific
   object class value, and are defined per-class.

   IANA should establish a registry of ICMP extention objects classes
   and class sub-types.  There are no values assigned within this
   document to maintain.  Object classes 0xF7 - 0xFF are reserved for
   private use.  Object class values are assignable on a first-come-
   first-serve.  The policy for assigning sub-type values should be
   defined in the document defining new class values.
