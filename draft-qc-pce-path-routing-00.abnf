Type = 1:  SID/Label Sub-TLV as defined in [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-
         routing-extensions].  PDE-ID Len and PDE- ID Value fields are
         defined as the above.

Type = 2:  SR-MPLS Prefix SID.  PDE-ID Len and PDE-ID Value are
         the same as Type 1.

Type = 3:  SR-MPLS Adjacency SID.  PDE-ID Len and PDE-ID Value are
         the same as Type 1.

Type = 4:  IPv4 Node Address.  PDE-ID Len is 4 bytes and PDE-ID
         Value is 4 bytes IPv4 address encoded similar to IPv4 Prefix
         described above.

Type = 5:  IPv4 P2P interface Address.  PDE-ID Len is 4 bytes and
         PDE-ID Value is 4 bytes IPv4 address encoded similar to IPv4
         Prefix described above.
Type = 6:  IPv4 LAN interface Address.  PDE-ID Len is 4 bytes and
         PDE-ID Value is 4 bytes IPv4 address encoded similar to IPv4
         Prefix described above.
