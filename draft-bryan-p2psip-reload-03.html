<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a
      peer-to-peer (P2P) binary signaling protocol for use on the Internet. A
      P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract hash table
      service between a set of cooperating peers that form the overlay
      network. RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation Protocol
      (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other applications with similar
      requirements by defining new usages that specify the data kinds that
      must be stored for a particular application. RELOAD defines a security
      model based on a certificate enrollment service that provides unique
      identities. NAT traversal is a fundamental service of the protocol.
      RELOAD also allows access from "client" nodes which do not need to route
      traffic or store data for others.

Introduction</h3>

<p>This document defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a
      peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet. It
      provides a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) service, which allows
      participating nodes to read and write entries into a hash table that is
      stored collectively among the participants. RELOAD is a lightweight,
      binary protocol. It provides several functions that are critical for a
      successful P2P protocol for the Internet. These are:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Security Framework:</dt>
<dd>Security is one of the most
          challenging problems in a P2P protocol. A P2P network will often be
          established among a set of peers that do not trust each other. Yet,
          despite this lack of trust, the network must operate reliably to
          allow storage and retrieval of data. RELOAD defines an abstract
          enrollment server, which all entities trust to generate unique
          identifiers for each user. Using that small amount of trust as an
          anchor, RELOAD defines a security framework that allows for
          authorization of P2P protocol functions and authentication of data
          stored in the overlay. This does not remove all attacks but greatly
          reduces the possible attack space.
</dd>
<dt>Usage Model:</dt>
<dd>RELOAD is designed to support a variety
          of applications, including P2P multimedia communications with the
          Session Initiation Protocol <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;concepts]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., &ldquo;Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. Consequently, RELOAD has
          the notion of a usage, one of which is defined to support each
          application (this document also defines the SIP usage for multimedia
          communications). Each usage identifies a set of data kind that need
          to be stored and retrieved from the DHT. Each kind defines a data
          structure, authorization policies, size quota, and information
          required for storage and retrieval in the DHT. The usage concept
          allows RELOAD to be used with new applications through a simple
          documentation process that supplies the details for each
          application.
</dd>
<dt>NAT Traversal:</dt>
<dd>Operations for NAT traversal are part
          of the base design, including establishing new RELOAD connections
          and tunneling SIP or other application protocols required by P2PSIP.
          RELOAD makes use of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
          <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for           Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer           Protocols,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> to facilitate the
          creation of the P2P network and the establishment of channels for
          use by the application protocol (SIP and RTP, for example). RELOAD
          also defines how peers in the P2P network act as STUN and TURN
          servers and how those resources can be discovered through the DHT.
          With these features, RELOAD can run in modes in which nearly all the
          peers are behind NATs, yet are able to fully participate without
          imposing any constraints on the actual DHT algorithm.
</dd>
<dt>High Performance Routing:</dt>
<dd>The very nature of DHT
          algorithms introduces a requirement that peers participating in the
          P2P network route requests on behalf of other peers in the network.
          This introduces a load on those other peers, in the form of
          bandwidth and processing power. RELOAD has been defined to reduce
          the amount of bandwidth and processing required of peers. It does so
          by using a very lightweight binary protocol, and furthermore, by
          defining a packet structure that facilitates low-complexity
          forwarding, including hardware-based forwarding. In particular, a
          generic transport header is used for routing the message through the
          overlay without the contents needing to be parsed by (or even
          visible to) intermediate peers. The header includes no information
          about specific IP addresses because none are needed to route along
          an overlay. The header only includes lists of peers which the
          message should be routed through/too, as well as some minor options
          and version flags. Clearly separating the header components
          necessary for routing from the message contents simplifies
          processing and increases security.
</dd>
<dt>Transport Flexibility:</dt>
<dd>RELOAD has native support for
          both DTLS and TLS for the underlying transport protocol, with
          support for DTLS over UDP as mandatory to implement. TLS over TCP is
          preferred because it has better bulk data performance and connection
          stability, but UDP is more likely to provide direct connections
          between peers in the presence of NATs. Explicit support for
          fragmentation is provided and required when using UDP. Because there
          is no single universally available and suitable transport protocol,
          the peer protocol must be flexible in this regard. New transports
          can be supported trivially.
</dd>
<dt>Pluggable DHT Algorithms:</dt>
<dd>RELOAD has been designed
          with an abstract interface to the overlay layer to simplify
          implementing a variety of structured (DHT) and unstructured overlay
          algorithms. This specification also defines how RELOAD is used with
          Chord, which is mandatory to implement. Specifying a default "must
          implement" DHT will allow interoperability, while the extensibility
          allows selection of DHTs optimized for a particular application.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>These properties were designed specifically to meet the requirements
      for a P2P protocol to support SIP. However, RELOAD is not limited to
      usage by SIP and could serve as a tool for supporting other P2P
      applications with similar needs. RELOAD is also based on the concepts
      introduced in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;concepts]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., &ldquo;Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.1.&nbsp;
Usage Layer</h3>

<p>The top layer, called the Usage Layer, has application usages,
          such as the SIP Location Usage, that use the abstract distributed
          storage API to store and retrieve data from the DHT. The goal of
          this layer is to implement application-specific usages of the
          Overlay Routing and Storage Layer below it. The Usage defines how a
          specific application maps its data into something that can be stored
          in the DHT, where to store the data, how to secure the data, and
          finally how applications can retrieve and use the data.
</p>
<p>The architecture diagram shows both a SIP usage and an XMPP
          usage. A single application may require multiple usages. A usage may
          define multiple kinds of data that are stored in the overlay and may
          also rely on kinds originally defined by other usages. A usage is
          not itself encoded on the wire, only the kind-ids and data models
          are, but is rather a specification of the functionality that is
          required for a given application. That specification typically
          specifies semantics, access control rules, and the format and size
          of the data which may be stored.
</p>
<p>One usage may depend on another. For example, the SIP usage
          depends on a Certificate Store usage (not shown in the diagram) to
          obtain the certificates required to authenticate messages. Because
          certificates are stored in standard X.509 form, there is no reason
          for each usage to specify this service independently.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1.2"></a><h3>1.1.2.&nbsp;
Overlay Routing and Storage Layer</h3>

<p>The Overlay Routing and Storage Layer stores and retrieves
          information, performs maintenance of the DHT as peers join and leave
          the DHT, and routes messages on the overlay. The DHT implementation
          is provided by a pluggable component so that each overlay can select
          an appropriate DHT that relies on the common RELOAD core code.
</p>
<p>The Overlay Routing and Replication Logic provides a fairly
          generic interface that allows the DHT implementation to control the
          overlay and resource operations and messages. Since each DHT is
          defined and functions differently, we generically refer to the table
          of other peers that the DHT maintains and uses to route requests
          (neighbors) as a Routing Table. The Logic component makes queries to
          the DHT's Routing Table to determine the next hop, then encodes and
          sends the message itself. Similarly, the DHT issues periodic update
          requests through the logic component to maintain and update its
          Routing Table.
</p>
<p>The DHT shown in the illustration is Chord, but a variety of DHT
          algorithms are possible through a pluggable interface. A single node
          could be functioning in multiple overlays simultaneously, each using
          its own DHT algorithm. Each peer is identified by and its location
          in the overlay determined by its Peer-ID that is assigned by the
          enrollment server when the user or peer first enrolls in the
          overlay. The Peer-ID also determines the set of resources which it
          will be responsible for storing. The exact mapping between these is
          determined by the DHT algorithm used by the overlay, therefore the
          logic component always queries the DHT to determine where a
          particular resource should be stored.
</p>
<p>As peers enter and leave, resources may be stored on different
          peers, so the information related to them is exchanged as peers
          enter and leave. Redundancy is used to protect against loss of
          information in the event of a peer failure and to protect against
          compromised or subversive peers. The Logic component notifies the
          DHT as neighbors join and leave, and the DHT updates its Routing
          Table and issues resource migration requests as appropriate.

Forwarding Layer</h3>

<p>This layer is responsible for getting a packet to the next peer,
          as determined by the Routing and Storage Layer. The Forwarding Layer
          establishes and maintains the network connections required by the
          DHT's Routing Table. This layer is also responsible for setting up
          connections to other peers through NATs and firewalls using ICE, and
          it can elect to forward traffic using relays for NAT and firewall
          traversal.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Security</h3>

<p>RELOAD provides two security mechanisms, one based on public key
        certificates and one based on a globally shared key.
</p>
<p>RELOAD's preferred security framework is built upon an enrollment
        server. The enrollment server issues each new peer a certificate that
        assigns it a Peer-ID. By generating the Peer-IDs randomly and
        controlling what peers are issued certificates, the enrollment server
        protects against many of the attacks on the overlay network.
        Similarly, all users are issued certificates for their identities by
        the enrollment server. All resources stored on the overlay must be
        signed by their creator, thus ensuring that an attacker cannot forge
        data belonging to another user. The enrollment process is only
        required to join the overlay (and perhaps to refresh an expired
        certificate). The peers and users do not need to have real-time access
        to the enrollment server.
</p>
<p>TLS or DTLS are used for communication between peers. In
        combination with the certificates, this provides both confidentiality
        and authentication for communication across the overlay. Applications
        such as P2PSIP can also make use of the users' certificates to achieve
        secure end-to-end connections at the application layer.
</p>
<p>RELOAD also provides for an authorization framework based on
        certificates. Each usage defines the access control rules for which
        users/peers are allowed to read/write each Resource-ID. This protects
        data belonging to one user from being written by another, as well as
        allowing for a distributed quota mechanism based on the maximum size
        of each kind of data.
</p>
<p>In addition to the enrollment server model, RELOAD offers a
        security model using a pre-shared-key. Although this provides
        significantly less security than is provided through an enrollment
        server, it allows ad hoc or ephemeral overlays to be set up with
        minimal effort on the part of the users.

          storing and retrieving the resource. One way to generate a
          Resource-ID is by applying a mapping function to some other unique
          name (e.g., user name or service name) for the resource. The
          Resource-ID is used by the distributed database algorithm to
          determine the peer or peers that are responsible for storing the
          data for the overlay. In structured P2P networks, resource-IDs are
          generally fixed length and are formed by hashing the resource
          identifier. In unstructured networks, resource identifiers may be
          used directly as resource-IDs and may have variable length.
</dd>
<dt>Peer:</dt>
<dd>A host that is participating in the DHT. By
          virtue of its participation it can store data and is responsible for
          some portion of the overlay.
</dd>
<dt>Peer-ID:</dt>
<dd>A value that uniquely identifies a peer.
          Peer-IDs 0 and 2^N - 1 are reserved and are invalid peer-IDs. A
          value of zero is not used in the wire protocol but can be used to
          indicate an invalid peer in implementations and APIs. The peer-id of
          2^N-1 is used on the wire protocol as a wildcard.
</dd>
<dt>Resource:</dt>
<dd>An object associated with a string
          identifier. In unstructured P2P networks, the identifier is used
          directly as a Resource-Id. In structured P2P networks the identifier
          can be mapped into a Resource-ID by using the string as the input to
          the hash function. A SIP resource, for example, is identified by its
          AOR.

<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Connection Table:</dt>
<dd>The set of peers to which a peer is
          directly connected. This includes peers with which CONNECT

</dd>
<dt>Routing Table:</dt>
<dd>The set of peers which a peer can use
          to route DHT messages. In general, these peers will all be on the
          connection table but not vice versa, because some peers will have
          CONNECTed but not sent updates. Peers may send messages directly to
          peers which are on the connection table but may only route messages
          to other peers through peers which are on the routing table.
</dd>
<dt>Hashed-ID:</dt>
<dd>The generic term for an identifier in the
          hash space of the DHT. Examples of Hashed-IDs include Resource-IDs
          and Peer-IDs. This only applies to structured overlays.
</dd>
<dt>Unhashed-ID:</dt>
<dd>An Unhashed-ID is a string used as an
          input to a hash function, the result of which is a Hashed-ID. This
          only applies to structured overlays.
</dd>
<dt>Usage:</dt>
<dd>A usage is an application that wishes to use
          the DHT for some purpose. Each application wishing to use the DHT
          defines a set of data kinds that it wishes to use. The SIP usage
          defines the location, certificate, STUN server and TURN server data
          kinds.
</dd>
<dt>Destination List:</dt>
<dd>A list of IDs through which a
          message is to be routed. This allows for request/response source
          routing. A single ID is a trivial form of destination list.

Distributed Storage Layer</h3>

<p>RELOAD is designed to be extensible to both structured and
        unstructured overlays. However, this version is only completely worked
        out for structured overlays such as DHTs. The following text assumes
        structured overlays; in particular Resource-IDs are assumed to be
        fixed length for any given overlay, although the protocol allows them
        to be variable length to allow extension to unstructured overlays.
</p>
<p>Each logical address in the DHT where data can be stored is
        referred to as a Resource-ID. A given peer will be responsible for
        storing data from many Resource-ID locations. Typically literature on
        DHTs uses the term "key" to refer to a location in the DHT; however,
        in this specification the term key is used to refer to public or
        private keys used for cryptographic operations and the term
        Resource-ID is used to refer to a location for storage in the DHT.

DHT Concepts</h3>

<p>While very early P2P systems used flood based techniques, some
          newer P2P systems locate resources using a Distributed Hash Table,
          or DHT to improve efficiency. Peers are organized using a
          Distributed Hash Table (DHT) structure. In such a system, every
          resource has a Resource-ID, which is obtained by hashing some
          keyword or value (an Unhashed-ID) that uniquely identifies the
          resource. Resources can be thought of as being stored in a hash
          table at the entry corresponding to their Resource-ID. The peers
          that make up the overlay network are also assigned an ID, called a
          Peer-ID, in the same hash space as the Resource-IDs. A peer is
          responsible for storing all resources that have Resource-IDs near
          the peer's Peer-ID. The hash space is divided up so that all of the
          hash space is always the responsibility of some particular peer,
          although as peers enter and leave the system a particular peer's
          area may change. Messages are exchanged between the peers in the DHT
          as the peers enter and leave to preserve the structure of the DHT
          and exchange stored entries. Various DHT implementations may
          visualize the hash space as a grid, circle, line, or hypercube.
</p>
<p>Peers keep information about the location of other peers in the
          hash space and typically know about many peers nearby in the hash
          space, and progressively fewer more distant peers. We refer to this
          table of other peers as a Routing Table. When a peer wishes to
          operate on a resource it consults the list of peers it is aware of
          and contacts the peer with the Peer-ID nearest the desired
          Resource-ID. If that peer does not know how to find the resource, it
          either returns information about a closer peer it knows about, or
          forwards the request to a closer peer. In this fashion, the request
          eventually reaches the peer responsible for the resource, which then
          replies to the requester.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.2"></a><h3>3.1.2.&nbsp;
DHT Topology</h3>

<p>Each DHT will have a somewhat different structure, but many of
          the concepts are common. The DHT defines a large space of
          Resource-IDs, which can be thought of as addresses. In many DHTs,
          the Resource-IDs are simply 128- or 160-bit integers. Each DHT also
          has a distance metric such that we can say that Resource-ID A is
          closer to Resource-ID B than to Resource-ID C.
</p>
<p>Each peer in the DHT is assigned a Peer-ID and is "responsible"
          for the nearby space of Resource-IDs. So, for instance, if we have a
          peer P, then it could also be responsible for storing data
          associated with Resource-ID P+epsilon as long as no other peer P was
          closer. The DHT Resource-ID space is divided so that some peer is
          responsible for each Resource-ID.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.3"></a><h3>3.1.3.&nbsp;
Routing</h3>

<p>The way routing works in a DHT is specified by the specific DHT
          algorithm but the basic concepts are common to most systems. Each
          peer maintains connections to some other set of peers N. There need
          not be anything special about the peers in N, except that the peer
          has a direct connection to them: it can reach them without going
          through any other peer. When it wishes to deliver a message to some
          peer P, it selects some member of N, N_i that is closer to P than
          itself (as a degenerate case, P may be in N). The peer sends the
          message to N_i. At this point two things can happen:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Recursive Routing:</dt>
<dd>N_i repeats the same process as
              P, sending the message to one of its peers N_j. This same
              process repeats until the message is delivered to N.
</dd>
<dt>Iterative Routing:</dt>
<dd>N_i consults its table of
              direct connections and selects a new peer N_j which is closer to
              N. It responds to the original sending peer with a redirect to
              N_j. The original peer then sends the message to N_j, where the
              process repeats until the sending peer is redirected to N.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The advantage of iterative routing is that it consumes less
          resources for the intermediate peers; they only have to send
          redirect messages rather than forwarding requests and responses. The
          advantage of recursive routing is that it does not require the
          sending or receiving peer to have a rich set of connections to other
          nodes in the overlay. Thus, iterative routing is problematic in
          NATed networks because there is no way to guarantee that a peer will
          be able to form a connection to whatever peer it is redirected to.
          In RELOAD, iterative routing is supported using the ROUTE-QUERY
          request.
</p>
<p>In most DHTs, the peers in N are selected in a particular way.
          One common strategy is to have them arranged exponentially further
          away from yourself so that any message can be routed in a O(log(N))
          steps. The details of the routing structure depend on the DHT
          algorithm, however, since it defines the distance metric and the
          structure of the connection table.
</p>
<p>In RELOAD, messages may either be REQUESTS or RESPONSES to
          REQUESTS. Requests are routed as described above. In principle,
          responses could be routed independently from requests. This is
          called "Asymmetric" routing because requests and responses will
          generally follow different paths through the network. Asymmetric
          routing makes diagnosis of errors difficult because you need to be
          able to acquire debugging information at multiple locations. In the
          alternative strategy, called "Symmetric" routing, as requests travel
          through the network they accumulate a history of the peers they
          passed through and responses are routed in the opposite direction so
          that they follow the same path in reverse. RELOAD supports both
          flavors of routing.
</p>
<p>Symmetric routing is easier to debug. Symmetric routing is also
          required when the overlay topology is changing. For example, when a
          new peer is joining the overlay, asymmetric routing cannot work
          because the response would not be able to reach the new peer until
          it has completed the joining process. Symmetric routing solves this
          situation because the response is routed from the admitting peer
          through the bootstrap peer, thus relying on a path that is already
          known and established. In order to implement symmetric routing,
          RELOAD provides the Via List (<a class='info' href='#sec-via-list'>Section&nbsp;3.2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Via Lists</span><span>)</span></a>)
          feature. Asymmetric routing, however, requires no state to be stored
          in the message (as a Via List) or in on-path peers.
</p>
<p>[[TODO: again, this is a topic that needs WG discussion. It seems
          like there are situations where symmetric is very desirable (e.g.,
          startup). It's less clear that asymmetric will have a
          performance/state difference that will be significant.]]
</p>
<p>[[TODO: it's not clear that symmetric/asymmetric is really that
          evocative a terminology. Henning suggested key-based/trace-based but
          EKR doesn't like that. Other suggestions?]]

Storing and Retrieving Structured Data</h3>

<p>The Data Storage Layer provides operations to STORE, FETCH, and
          REMOVE data. Each location in the DHT is referenced by a single
          integer Resource-ID. However, each location may contain data
          elements corresponding to multiple kinds (e.g., certificate, SIP
          registration). Similarly, there may be multiple elements of a given
          kind.

<p>Each kind is identified by a kind-id, which is a code point

Joining, Leaving, and Maintenance</h3>

<p>When a new peer wishes to join the DHT, it must have a peer-id
          that it is allowed to use. It uses one of the peer-ids in the
          certificate it received from the enrollment server. The main steps
          in joining the DHT are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Forming connections to some other peers.
</li>
<li>Acquiring the data values this peer is responsible for
              storing.
</li>
<li>Informing the other peers which were previously responsible
              for that data that this peer has taken over responsibility.
</li>
</ul>

<p>First, the peer ("JP," for Joining Peer) uses the bootstrap
          procedures to find some (any) peer in the DHT. It then typically
          contacts the peer which would have formerly been responsible for the
          peer's Resource-ID (since that is where in the DHT the peer will be
          joining), the Admitting Peer (AP). It copies the other peer's state,
          including the data values it is now responsible for and the
          identities of the peers with which the other peer has direct
          connections.
</p>
<p>The details of this operation depend mostly on the DHT involved,
          but a typical case would be:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>JP sends a JOIN request to AP announcing its intention to
              join.
</li>
<li>AP sends an JOIN response.
</li>
<li>AP does a sequence of STOREs to JP to give it the data it
              will need.
</li>
<li>AP does UPDATEs to JP and to other peers to tell it about its
              own routing table. At this point, both JP and AP consider JP
              responsible for some section of the DHT.
</li>
<li>JP makes its own connections to the appropriate peers in the
              DHT.
</li>
</ol>

<p>After this process is completed, JP is a full member of the DHT
          and can process STORE/FETCH requests.

Forming Direct Connections</h3>

<p>As described in <a class='info' href='#sec.routing'>Section&nbsp;3.1.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Routing</span><span>)</span></a>, a peer
          maintains a set of direct connections to other peers in the DHT.
          Consider the case of a peer JP just joining the DHT. It communicates
          with the admitting peer AP and gets the list of the peers in AP's
          routing table. Naively, it could simply connect to the IP address
          listed for each peer, but this works poorly if some of those peers
          are behind a NAT or firewall. Instead, we use the CONNECT request to
          establish a connection.
</p>
<p>Say that peer A wishes to form a direct connection to peer B. It
          gathers ICE candidates and packages them up in a CONNECT request
          which it sends to B through usual DHT routing procedures. B does its
          own candidate gathering and sends back a response with its
          candidates. A and B then do ICE connectivity checks on the candidate
          pairs. The result is a connection between A and B. At this point, A
          and B can add each other to their routing tables and send messages
          directly between themselves without going through other DHT
          peers.
</p>
<p>In general, a peer needs to maintain connections to all of the
          peers near it in the DHT and to enough other peers to have efficient
          routing (the details depend on the specific DHT). If a peer cannot
          form a connection to some other peer, this isn't necessarily a
          disaster; DHTs can route correctly even without fully connected
          links. However, a peer should try to maintain the specified link set
          and if it detects that it has fewer direct connections, should form
          more as required.

Via Lists</h3>

<p>In a general messaging system, messages need a source and a
          destination and peers need to be able to send a response to the peer
          that sent the request. This can be particularly tricky in overlay
          networks when a new peer is joining, or the overlay network is
          stabilizing and different peers have different ideas on what the
          overlay topology is. A simple and reliable way to make sure that a
          response can reach the node that sent the request in these
          situations is to have the response traverse the reverse path of the
          request.

<p>The approach used here is to have each node the request traverses
          add its peer-id to the "via list" in the request. Then the response
          is routed by looking at the list and using it as list of peers that
          the response will be routed thorough. To support this, each message
          has a destination list of nodes it needs to be routed through as
          well as a via list of what nodes it has traversed.
</p>
<p>When a peer receives a message from the Transport Layer, it adds
          the peer-id of the node it received the message from to the end of
          the via list. When a peer goes to transmit a message to the
          Transport Layer, it looks at the first entry on the destination
          list. If the entry is this peer, it removes this entry from the list
          and looks at the next entry and if the entry is not this peer, it
          sends the message to the first peer on the destination list.
</p>
<p>When a peer goes to send a response to a request, it can simply
          copy the via list in reverse to form the destination list for the
          response if it wishes to route the response along the reverse path
          as the request.
</p>
<p>Peers that are willing to maintain state may do list compression
          for privacy reason and to reduce the message size. They do this by
          taking some number of entries off the via list and replacing them
          with a unique entry that this peer can later identify. Later, if the
          peer sees the unique entry in a destination list, it removes the
          unique entry and replaces it with the all the entries removed from
          the original via list (and reverses the order of these entries).
          Note that this technique will generally require storing some
          per-message state on the intermediate peer, so this is a
          bandwidth/per-peer state tradeoff. The exception is if the list is
          not compressed but rather the peer-ids are simply encrypted.
</p>
<p>The via list approach provides several features. First it allows
          a response to follow the same path as the request. This is
          particularly important for peers that are sending requests while
          they are joining and before other peers can route to them as well as
          situations where message are being exchanged to stabilize the
          overlay network. It also makes it easier to diagnose and manage the
          system when all peers see the response to any request they
          forward.

Clients</h3>

<p>RELOAD also allows for the possibility of client nodes. A client
          is a node with a peer-id which connects to an admitting peer (or
          peers) like an ordinary peer but never sends a JOIN or an UPDATE. It
          is therefore in the AP's connection table but not its routing table
          and never is used to store any DHT data. However, because it is
          reachable through the AP, it can still send and receive messages.
          The client MUST still have the usual credentials. Also, because it
          never sends JOINs it is never responsible for storing data.
</p>
<p>Because the client may only have a connection to a single AP,
          which, due to topology shifts may no longer be the responsible peer,
          clients SHOULD use symmetric routing and should advertise route
          lists that contain both the AP to which they are connected and
          themselves. E.g., if the client has peer-id X and the AP has peer-id
          Y, the client should advertise the destination list (Y, X). This
          guarantees reachability.
</p>
<p>Note that clients MAY also contact APs which are not in fact
          responsible for the client's peer-id.

Transport Layer</h3>

<p>The transport layer sends and receives messages over TLS and DTLS.
        For TLS it simply pushes the messages into the stream. For DTLS it
        takes care of fragmentation issues. The reason for including TLS is
        the improved performance it can offer for bulk transport of data. The
        reason for including DTLS is that the percentage of the time that two
        devices behind NATs can form a direct connection without a relay is
        much higher for DTLS than for TLS. If all NATs were <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-tcp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;tcp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Guha, S., &ldquo;NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> compliant, then TLS over TCP

Enrollment</h3>

<p>Before a new user can join the DHT for the first time, they must
        enroll in the P2P Network for the DHT they want to join. Enrollment
        will typically be done by contacting a centralized enrollment server.
        Other approaches (for instance static out of band configuration) are
        possible but are outside the scope of this specification. During
        enrollment a new node learns about a particular overlay, sets up a
        names and credentials, and discovers the bootstrap nodes. This would
        typically be done when a new peer joined an overlay for the very first
        time. Bootstrap is the process that happens each time a node boots and
        is how the peer finds an node that can be used to join the
        overlay.
</p>
<p>Before a node can join an overlay, it needs to be provided with a
        name for the overlay. Some examples are "example.com", "example", and
        "example.local". This name is resolved via a DNS SRV lookup for
        service name p2p_enroll and a protocol of tcp. If the TLD for the name
        is .local, then this DNS SRV lookup is done using <a class='info' href='#I-D.cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns'>[I&#8209;D.cheshire&#8209;dnsext&#8209;multicastdns]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cheshire, S. and M. Krochmal, &ldquo;Multicast DNS,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> and the service name
        p2p_menroll. The intention here is to support ad hoc/local overlays.
        The resulting DNS lookup will provide the address of a enrollment
        server. Once this server is found, HTTPS is used to retrieve a XML
        file that contains the parameters for the overlay. These include
        things such as: what algorithms the overlay uses, overlay parameters,
        what usages are a peer on this overlay is required to support, the
        type of credentials required, addresses of credentials servers, the
        root certificate for the DHT, information about the DHT algorithm that
        is being used, a P2P-Network-Id that uniquely identifies this ring,
        and any other parameters it may need to connect to the DHT. The DHT
        also informs the peers what Usages it is required to support to be a
        peer on this P2P Network. It also provides an initial list of
        bootstrap nodes that consists of multiple bootstrap entries that each
        have the IP address and port for contacting a bootstrap peer. Some of
        the address may be multicast addresses. In the case of multicast DNS,
        every peer may also act as an enrollment server.
</p>

Certificate Issuance</h3>

<p>Once the peer has the XML file that identifies if credentials are
          needed, it can contact the credential server. The user establishes
          his identity to the server's satisfaction and provides the server
          with its public key. The centralized server then returns a
          certificate binding the user's user name to his public key. The
          properties of the certificate are discussed in <a class='info' href='#sec-security-intro'>Section&nbsp;3.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Security</span><span>)</span></a>. The amount of authentication
          performed here can vary radically depending on the DHT network being
          joined. Some networks may do no verification at all and some may
          require extensive identity verification (e.g., checking a driver's
          license) before issuing credentials for a given user name. The only
          invariant that the enrollment server needs to ensure is that no two
          users may have the same identity.

Bootstrap</h3>

<p>The above steps are only done the first time a peer joins a new

          time (as listed in the configuration document) and need to be
          refreshed. The next step is the bootstrap step which is done every
          time the peer boots.
</p>
<p>Bootstrapping consists of looking at the list of cached nodes and
          bootstraps nodes and sending a RELOAD PING to them to see if they
          respond. Once a node responds, it can be used to join the overlay.
          After a node has joined, it keeps track of a small number of peers
          to which it could directly connect. Theses are saved as the cached
          nodes and used next time the peer boots. The point of the cached
          nodes is to reduce the load on the bootstrap nodes.

Certificate-Based Security</h3>

<p>The certificate-based security model revolves around the
          enrollment process allocating a unique name to the user and issuing
          a certificate <a class='info' href='#RFC3280'>[RFC3280]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R., Polk, W., Ford, W., and D. Solo, &ldquo;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and           Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> for a public/private
          key pair for the user. All peers in a particular DHT can verify
          these certificates. A given peer acts on behalf of a user, and that
          user is responsible for its operation.
</p>
<p>The certificate serves two purposes:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>It entitles the user to store data at specific locations in
              the DHT. Each usage defines the specific rules for determining
              which certificates can access each Hashed-ID/kind-id pair. For
              instance, some usages might allow anyone to write at a given
              location, whereas others might restrict writes to a single
              certificate.
</li>
<li>It entitles the user to operate a peer that has a peer-id
              found in the certificate. When the peer is acting as a DTLS or
              TLS server, it can use this certificate so that a client
              connecting to it knows it is connected to the correct
              server.
</li>
</ul>

<p>When a user enrolls, or enrolls a device with no keying material,
          the user is given a certificate. This certificate contains
          information that identifies the user and the device they are using.
          If a user has more than one device, typically they would get one
          certificate for each device. This allows each device to act as a
          separate peer.
</p>
<p>The contents of the certificate include:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A public key provided by the user.
</li>
<li>Zero or more user names that the DHT is allowing this user to
              use. For example, "alice@example.org". Typically a certificate
              will have one name. In the SIP usage, this name corresponds to
              the AOR.
</li>
<li>Zero or more peer-ids. Typically there will be one peer-id.
              Each device will use a different peer-id, even if two devices
              belong to the same user. Peer-IDs should be chosen randomly by
              the enrollment server.
</li>
<li>A serial number that is unique to this certificate across all
              the certificates issued for this DHT.
</li>
<li>An expiration time for the certificate.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that because peer-IDs are chosen randomly, they will be
          randomly distributed with respect to the user name. This has the
          result that any given peer is highly unlikely to be responsible for
          storing data corresponding to its own user, which promotes high
          availability.

Storage Permissions</h3>

<p>When a peer uses a STORE request to place data at a particular
            location X, it must sign with the private key that corresponds to
            a certificate that is suitable for storing at location X. Each
            data kind in a usage defines the exact rules for determining what
            certificate is appropriate.
</p>
<p>The most natural rule is that a certificate with user name X
            "owns" data located at Hash(X) (X is the Unhashed-ID and Hash(X)
            is the Hashed-ID) and only he can write there. This rules is used
            for all the kinds defined in this specification. Thus, only a user
            with a certificate for "alice@example.org" could write to that
            location in the DHT. However, other usages can define any rules
            they choose, including publicly writable values.
</p>
<p>The digital signature over the data serves two purposes. First,
            it allows the peer responsible for storing the data to verify that
            this STORE is authorized. Second, it provides integrity for the
            data. The signature is saved along with the data value (or values)
            so that any reader can verify the integrity of the data. Of
            course, the responsible peer can "lose" the value but it cannot
            undetectably modify it.

Peer Permissions</h3>

<p>The second purpose of a certificate is to allow the device to
            act as a peer with the specified peer-ID. When a peer wishes to
            connect to peer X, it forms a TLS/DTLS connection to the peer and
            then performs TLS mutual authentication and verifies that the
            presented certificate contains peer-ID X.
</p>
<p>Note that because the formation of a connection between two
            nodes generally requires traversing other nodes in the DHT, as
            specified in <a class='info' href='#direct.connect'>Section&nbsp;3.2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Forming Direct Connections</span><span>)</span></a>, those nodes
            can interfere with connection initiation. However, if they attempt
            to impersonate the target peer they will be unable to complete the
            TLS mutual authentication: therefore such attacks can be
            detected.

          authenticate the peer-to-peer DTLS connections via TLS-PSK/TLS-SRP.
          If shared-key security mode is in use, a shared-key capable cipher
          suite such as TLS-PSK or TLS-SRP MUST be used. This is useful for
          admission control, but is completely unsafe in any setting where

Migration</h3>

<p>At some point in time, a given P2P Network may want to migrate from
        one underlying DHT algorithm to another or update to a later extension
        of the protocol. This can also be used for crypto agility issues. The
        migration approach is done by having peers initializing algorithm A.
        When the clients go to periodically renew their credentials, they find
        out that the P2P Network now requires them to use algorithm A but also
        to store all the data with algorithm B. At this point there are
        effectively two DHT rings in use, rings A and B. All data is written
        to both but queries only go to A. At some point when the clients
        periodically renew their credentials, they learn that the P2P Network
        has moved to storing to both A and B but that FETCH requests are done
        with P2P Network B and that any SEND should first be attempted on P2P
        Network B and if that fails, retried on P2P Network A. In the final
        stage when clients renew credentials, they find out that P2P Network A
        is no longer required and only P2P Network B is in use. Some types of
        usages and environments may be able to migrate very quickly and do all
        of these steps in under a week, depending on how quickly software that
        supports both A and B is deployed and how often credentials are
        renewed. On the other hand, some very ad-hoc environments involving
        software from many different providers may take years to migrate.

Usages Layer</h3>

<p>By itself, the distributed storage layer just provides
        infrastructure on which applications are built. In order to do
        anything useful, a usage must be defined. Each Usage needs to specify
        several things:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Register kind-id code points for any kinds that the Usage
            defines.
</li>
<li>Define the data structure for each of the kinds.
</li>
<li>Define access control rules for each kinds.
</li>
<li>Provide a size limit for each kinds.
</li>
<li>Define how the Unhashed-ID is formed that is hashed to form the
            Resource-ID where each kind is stored.
</li>
<li>Describe how values will be merged after a network partition.
            Unless otherwise specified, the default merging rule is to act as
            if all the values that need to be merged were stored and that the
            order they were stored in corresponds to the stored time values
            associated with (and carried in) their values. Because the stored
            time values are those associated with the peer which did the
            writing, clock skew is generally not an issue. If if two nodes are
            on different partitions, clocks, this can create merge conflicts.
            However because RELOAD deliberately segregates storage so that
            data from different users and peers is stored in different
            locations, and a single peer will typically only be in a single
            network partition, this case will generally not arise.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The kinds defined by a usage may also be applied to other usages.
        However, a need for different parameters, such as different size
        limits, would imply the need to create a new kind.

SIP Usage</h3>

<p>From the perspective of P2PSIP, the most important usage is the
          SIP Usage. The basic function of the SIP usage is to allow Alice to
          start with a SIP URI (e.g., "bob@dht.example.com") and end up with a
          connection which Bob's SIP UA can use to pass SIP messages back and
          forth to Alice's SIP UA.
</p>
<p>This is done using three key operations that are provided by the
          SIP Usage. They are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Mapping SIP URIs that are not GRUUs to other SIP URIs or to
              the DHT peer responsible for the SIP UA.
</li>
<li>Mapping SIP GRUUs to the DHT peer responsible for the SIP
              UA.
</li>
<li>Forming a connection directly to a DHT peer that is used to
              send SIP messages to the SIP UA.
</li>
</ul>

<p>All SIP URIs for a given overlay MUST be constructed so that they
          terminate in the domain name of the overlay. For instance, if the
          overlay name is "example.com", then all AORs must be of the form
          {sip,sips}:username@example.com. Accordingly, to dereference a URI,
          a P2PSIP implementation MUST check to see if the domain matches an
          overlay which it is a member of. If so, it uses the following
          procedures. Otherwise, it MUST follow <a class='info' href='#RFC3263'>[RFC3263]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Locating SIP           Servers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>
          procedures. Note that unless the P2PSIP overlay provides some kind
          of gateway to ordinary SIP (e.g., a publicly accessible SIP server)
          this is likely to be only partially successful, since, for instance,
          the callee may not be able to call back.

<a name="rfc.section.3.7.1.1"></a><h3>3.7.1.1.&nbsp;
SIP Location</h3>

<p>A peer acting as a SIP UA stores their registration information
            in the DHT by storing either another URI (for retargeting) or a
            destination lists to reach them at a Resource-ID in the DHT formed
            from the user's SIP AOR. When another peer wishes to find a peer
            that is registered for a SIP URI, the lookup of the user's name is
            done by taking the user's SIP Address or Record (AOR) and using it
            as the Unhashed-ID that is hashed to get a Resource-ID. When the
            Unhashed-ID is dereferenced, the result is a set of values. Each
            value is either another SIP URI or a destination list. If the
            value is a SIP URI, the calling peer looks up that URI and
            continues the process until it gets a destination list.
</p>
<p>If the value is a destination list, then it is used to reach a
            peer that represents a SIP UA registered for that AOR. Typically
            this destination list will have just one entry but in the case of
            peers or clients that can not be directly reached (for instance
            via a strict NAT or firewall), a destination list with more than
            one entry may need to be used.
</p>
<p>The Unhashed-ID for this usage is a user's SIP AOR, such as
            "sip:alice@example.com". This allows the set to store many values
            in a dictionary structure. The authorization policy is that STORE
            requests are only allowed if the user name in the signing
            certificate, when turned into a SIP URL and hashed, matches the
            Resource-ID. This policy ensures that only a user with the
            certificate with the user name "alice@example.com" can write to
            the Resource-ID that will be used to look up calls to
            "sip:alice@example.com".
</p>
<p>[[Open Issue: Should the Unhashed-ID be
            "sip:alice@example.com", "alice@example.com", or a string that
            includes the code point defined for the kind? The issue here is
            determining whether different usages that store data at a
            Unhashed-ID that is primarily formed from "alice@example.com"
            should hash to the same Resource-ID as the SIP Usage. For example,
            if a buddy list had a Unhashed-ID that was roughly the same, would
            we want the buddy list information to end up on the same peers
            that stored the SIP location data or on different peers?]]

Base Protocol</h3>

<p>RELOAD is a message-oriented request/response protocol. The messages
      are encoded using binary fields. All integers are represented in network
      byte order. The general philosophy behind the design was to use Type,
      Length, Value fields to allow for extensibility. However, for the parts
      of a structure that were required in all messages, just define theses in
      a fixed position as adding a type and length for them is unnecessary and
      would simply increase bandwidth and introduces new potentials for
      interoperability issues.
</p>
<p>Each message has three parts:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Forwarding Header:</dt>
<dd>Each message has a generic header
          which is used to forward the message between peers and to its final
          destination. This header is the only information that an
          intermediate peer (i.e., one that is not the target of a message)
          needs to examine.
</dd>
<dt>Message Contents:</dt>
<dd>The message being delivered between
          the peers. From the perspective of the forwarding layer, the

          layers.
</dd>

        the message has passed. The via list starts out empty and grows as the
        message traverses each peer.
</p>
<p>If a message was being sent thought the sequences of peers A,B,C,D,

        list of B,C,D. The message from B to C would have a via list of A then
        route of C,D and so on. This means that when the route list is
        followed exactly, all that is needed to update these lists is to
        change their lengths. This avoids the need to change or move any of
        the other list entries. In other cases, some entries may need to be

Changes to Forwarding Header</h3>

<p>The RELOAD-01 forwarding header was completely fixed, whereas
          this header includes lists that change en-route. However, this type
          of operation is easily accomplished in both software and hardware,
          therefore we still view it as a low-overhead header. The changes
          include the following.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Rearranged fields to have a cleaner separation between
              payload and header.
</li>
<li>Removed DHT, Hash, and Security parameters. These are now in
              the overlay bootstrap system rather than per-message.
</li>
<li>Source and destination IDs are now destination lists to
              accommodate source routing and recursion without state on
              intermediate peers.
</li>
<li>Added route log to header to allow payload/header
              separation.

Request Origination</h3>

<p>In order to send a message to a given peer-id or resource-id, a
            peer must construct an appropriate destination list. The most
            common such destination list is a single entry containing the
            peer/resource-id. This simply uses the normal DHT routing
            mechanisms to forward the message to that destination.
</p>
<p>Messages can also be source routed. In order to construct a
            source route, the originator provides a destination list
            containing a sequence of resource-ids. The semantics of this
            destination list are that the message is to traverse in order
            (potentially with intermediate hops) each entry on the destination
            list. As each peer is traversed, that entry is removed from the
            destination list. This makes it possible to address a peer which
            is potentially behind a NAT or a firewall in such a way that it
            cannot be connected to directly under any circumstances.
</p>

            requests/responses. This is an open issue.]

Response Origination</h3>

<p>When a peer sends a response to a request, it SHOULD construct
            the destination list by reversing the order of the entries on the
            via list. This has the result that the response traverses (at
            least) the same peers as the request traversed, except in reverse
            order (symmetric routing). For asymmetric routing, the peer MAY
            simply use the first entry on the via list.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.2.3"></a><h3>4.1.2.3.&nbsp;
Message Receipt and Forwarding</h3>

<p>When a peer receives a message, it first examines the overlay,
            version, and other header fields to determine whether the message
            is one it can process. If any of these are incorrect (e.g., the
            message is for an overlay in which the peer does not participate)
            it is an error. The peer SHOULD generate an appropriate error but
            MAY simply drop the message.
</p>
<p>Once the peer has determined that the message is correctly
            formatted, it examines the first entry on the destination list.
            There are three possible cases here:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The first entry on the destination list is a private id
                which is being used for destination list compression.
</li>
<li>The first entry on the destination list is an id for which
                the peer is responsible.
</li>
<li>The first entry on the destination list is for which
                another peer is responsible.
</li>
</ul>

<p>These cases are handled separately.

Private ID</h3>

<p>If the first entry on the destination list is a private id,
              the peer replaces that entry with the store local value that it
              indexes and then re-examines the destination list to determine
              which case now applies.

Responsible ID</h3>

<p>If the first entry on the destination list is a Hashed-ID for
              which the peer is responsible, the peer strips the entry off the
              route list. If there are remaining entries on the destination
              list, the peer then re-examines the destination list to
              determine which case now applies. If the destination list is now
              empty, then the message was destined for this peer and it MUST
              pass it to the next layer up.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.2.3.3"></a><h3>4.1.2.3.3.&nbsp;
Other Hashed-ID</h3>

<p>If neither of the other two cases applies, then the peer MUST
              forward the message towards the first entry on the destination
              list. This means that it MUST select one of the peers in its
              route table which is closer to the first entry than to itself
              and send the message to that peer. If the first entry on the
              destination list is in the peer's connection table, then it
              SHOULD forward the message to that peer directly.
</p>
<p>When forwarding a message, the peer MUST:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Decrement the TTL value
</li>
<li>Update the via list.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The natural way to update the via list is simply to add the
              peer-id of the peer from which the message was received to the
              end of the list. However, peers may use any algorithm of their
              choice provided that if the peer received a destination list
              constructed by reversing the via list it would be able to route
              the outgoing message correctly, enabling symmetric routing.
</p>
<p>For instance, if node D receives a message from node C with
              via list (A, B), the simple approach is simply to forward to the
              next node (E) with via list (A, B, C). Now, if E wants to
              respond to the message, it reverses the via list to produce the
              destination list, resulting in (D, C, B, A). When D forwards the
              response to C, the destination list will contain (B, A).
              However, node D could also list compression and send E the via
              list (X). E would then use the destination list (D, X). When D
              processes this destination list, it MUST detect that X is a
              compressed entry, recover the via list (A, B, C), and reverse
              that to produce the correct destination list (C, B, A) before
              sending it to C.
</p>
<p>Note that if a peer is using list compression and then exits
              the overlay, the message cannot be forwarded and will be
              dropped. The ordinary timeout and retransmission networks
              provide stability over this type of failure.

Fragmentation and Reassembly</h3>

<p>In order to allow transport over datagram protocols, RELOAD
          messages may be fragmented. If a message is too large for a peer to
          transmit to the next peer it MUST fragment the message. Note that
          this implies that intermediate peers may re-fragment messages if the
          incoming and outgoing paths have different maximum datagram sizes.
          Intermediate peers SHOULD NOT reassemble fragments.
</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a fragmented message by the intended peer, the
          peer holds the fragments in a holding buffer until the entire
          message has been received. The message is then reassembled into a
          single unfragmented message and processed. In order to prevent
          denial of service attacks, receivers SHOULD time out incomplete
          fragments. [[TODO: Describe algorithm]]

Route Logging</h3>

<p>The route logging feature provides diagnostic information about
          the path taken by the request so far and in this manner it is
          similar in function to <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>SIP's<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., and J. Peterson, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3261] Via
          header field. If the ROUTE-LOG flag is set in the Flags word, at
          each hop peers MUST append a route log entry to the route log
          element in the header. The order of the route log entry elements in
          the message is determined by the order of the peers were traversed
          along the path. The first route log entry corresponds to the peer at
          the first hop along the path, and each subsequent entry corresponds
          to the peer at the next hop along the path. If the ROUTE-LOG flag is
          set in a request, the route log MUST be copied into the response and
          the ROUTE-LOG flag set so that the originator receives the ROUTE-LOG
          data.
</p>
<p>If the responder wishes to have a route log in the reverse
          direction, it MAY set the ROUTE-LOG flag in its response as well.
          Note, however, that this means that the response will grow on the
          return path, which may potentially mean that it gets dropped due to
          becoming too large for some intermediate hop. Thus, this option must
          be used with care.

<p>A peer processing a request returns its status in the Message Code
        field of the common header. If the request was a success, then the
        message code is the response code that matches the request (i.e., the
        next code up). The response payload is then as defined in the
        request/response descriptions.
</p>
<p>If the request failed, then the message code is set to 0xffff
        (error) and the payload MUST be an error_response PDU, as shown
        below.
</p>
<p>For any code other than 200, the payload should be as defined
        below:

Reliability for Unreliable Transports</h3>

<p>When RELOAD is carried over DTLS or another unreliable transport,
          it needs to be used with a reliability and flow control mechanism,
          which is provided on a hop-by-hop basis, matching the semantics if
          TCP were used. The basic principle is that each message, regardless
          of if it carries a request or responses, will get an ACK and be
          reliably retransmitted. The receiver's job is very simple, limited
          to just sending ACKs. All the complexity is at the sender side. This
          allows the sending implementation to trade off performance versus
          implementation complexity without affecting the wire protocol.

<p>When the receiver receive a message, it SHOULD immediately send
            an ACK message. The receiver MUST keep track of the 32 most recent
            sequence numbers received on this DTLS flow. The contents of this
            packet are:
</p>
<p></p>

<dt>Ack Seq -</dt>
<dd>The sequence number of the message

<dd>A bitmask indicating whether or not
                each of the previous 32 packets has been received. The high

                space.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The received field bits in the ACK provide a very high degree
            of redundancy for the sender to figure out which packets the
            receiver received and can then estimate packet loss rates. If the
            sender also keeps track of the time at which recent sequence
            numbers were sent, the RTT can be estimated.

HIP</h3>

<p>RELOAD MAY also be used with a HIP transport using the architecture
        for HIP BONE described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.camarillo-hip-bone'>[I&#8209;D.camarillo&#8209;hip&#8209;bone]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Camarillo, G., Nikander, P., and J. Hautakorpi, &ldquo;HIP BONE: Host Identity Protocol (HIP) Based Overlay           Networking Environment,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. From the perspective of the
        P2P layer, HIP looks very much like normal IP. Either TLS (over TCP)
        or DTLS (over UDP) is run over top of the HIP. Thus the reliability
        and congestion control schemes are the same for DTLS section. If an
        overlay is configured such that HIP is the only transport that it will
        use, then it may make sense to configure the p2p layer to only offer
        the ORCHID when gather candidate addresses for ICE. This will
        effectively disable ICE at the p2p layer.
</p>
<p>For overlays that use HIP, the enrollment server MUST provide each
        peer with a unique ORCHID and use that ORCHID to generate the peer-id
        for the peer (see <a class='info' href='#sec-credentials'>Section&nbsp;10.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Credentials</span><span>)</span></a>. Later when
        the HIP layer wishes to tunnel a message (such as an I1 message)
        through the overlay, the HIP layer can use the ORCHID to generate the
        peer-id, and then use the TUNNEL message with the HIP to route the
        message to that the peer that owns that ORCHID.

            procedures of <a class='info' href='#sec-connect-ice'>Section&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class='info'>ICE and Connection Formation</span><span>)</span></a> to process
            the request and generate its own response (a CONNECT_A) containing
            a connect_data object. It should then begin ICE checks. When a
            peer receives a CONNECT response, it SHOULD parse the response and
            begin its own ICE checks.

TUNNEL</h3>

<p>A node sends a TUNNEL request when it wishes to exchange
          application-layer protocol messages without the expense of
          establishing a direct connection via CONNECT or when ICE is unable
          to establish a direct connection via CONNECT and a TURN relay is not
          available. The application-level protocols that are routed via the
          TUNNEL request are defined by that application's usage.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Note:</dt>
<dd>The decision of whether to route
              application-level traffic across the overlay or to open a direct
              connection requires careful consideration of the overhead
              involved in each transaction. Establishing a direct connection
              requires greater initial setup costs, but after setup,
              communication is faster and imposes no overhead on the overlay.
              For example, for the SIP usage, an INVITE request to establish a
              voice call might be routed over the overlay, a SUBSCRIBE with
              regular updates would be better used with a CONNECT, and media
              would both impose too great a load on the overlay and likely
              receive unacceptable performance. However, there may be a
              tradeoff between locating TURN servers and relying on TUNNEL for
              packet routing.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>When a usage requires the TUNNEL method, it must specify the
          specific application protocol(s) that will be TUNNELed and for each
          protocol, specify:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>An application attribute that indicates the protocol being
              tunneled. This the IANA-registered port of the application
              protocol.
</li>
<li>The conditions under which the application will be TUNNELed
              over the overlay rather than using a direct CONNECT.
</li>
<li>A mechanism for moving future application-level communication
              from TUNNELing on the overlay to a direct CONNECTion, or an
              explanation why this is unnecessary.
</li>
<li>A means of associating messages together as required for
              dialog-oriented or request/response-oriented protocols.
</li>
<li>How the TUNNELed message (and associated responses) will be
              delivered to the correct application. This is particularly
              important if there might be multiple instances of the

          such as limits on size, on the values which may be stored. For many
          kinds, the set may be restricted to a single item; some sets may be
          allowed to contain multiple identical items while others may only
          have unique items. The protocol currently defines the following data

</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">

</li>
<li>array
</li>
<li>dictionary

<p>As with STORE, the FETCH_Q contains a list of kind-ids and

</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the data is of data model single value, the reference is
                empty.
</li>
<li>If the data is of data model array, the reference contains
                two integers. The first integer is the beginning of the range
                and the second is the end of the range. 0 is used to indicate
                the first element and -1 is used to indicate the final
                element. The beginning of the range MUST be earlier in the
                array then the end.
</li>
<li>If the data is of data model dictionary then the reference
                contains a list of the dictionary keys being requested. If no
                keys are specified, than this is a wildcard fetch and all
                key-value pairs are returned. [[TODO: We really need a way to
                return only the keys. We'll need to modify this.]]

<p>The generation-counter is used to indicate the requester's
            expected state of the storing peer. If the generation-counter in
            the request matches the stored counter, then the storing peer
            returns a cache hit indicator rather than the stored data.
</p>
<p>Note that because the certificate for a user is typically
            stored at the same location as any data stored for that user, a
            requesting peer which does not already have the user's certificate
            should request the certificate in the FETCH as an
            optimization.

REMOVE</h3>

<p>The REMOVE request is used to remove a stored element or elements
          from the storing peer. Although each kind defines its own access
          control requirements, in general only the original signer of the
          data should be allowed to remove it. Any successful remove of an
          existing element for a given kind MUST increment the generation
          counter by at least one.
</p>
<p>A remove-request has exactly the same syntax as a FETCH request
          except that each entry represents a set of values to be removed
          rather than returned. The same kind-id MUST NOT be used twice in a
          given remove-request. Each fetch_kind_data is then processed in
          turn. These operations MUST be atomic. If any operation fails, the
          state MUST be rolled back to before the request was received.
</p>
<p>Before processing the REMOVE request, the peer MUST perform the
          following checks.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The kind-id is known.
</li>
<li>The signature over the message is valid or (depending on
              overlay policy) no signature is required.
</li>
<li>The signer of the message has permissions which permit him to
              remove this kind of data.
</li>
<li>If the generation-counter is non-zero, it must equal the
              current value of the generation-counter for this kind. This
              feature allows the generation counter to be used in a way
              similar to the HTTP Etag feature.

ROUTE_QUERY</h3>

<p>The ROUTE_QUERY request allows the sender to ask a peer where
          they would route a message directed to a given destination. In other
          words, a ROUTE-QUERY for destination X requests the peer-id where
          the receiving peer would next route to get to X. A ROUTE-QUERY can
          also request that the receiving peer initiate an UPDATE request to
          transfer his routing table.
</p>
<p>One important use of the ROUTE-QUERY request is to support
          iterative routing. The way that his works is that the sender selects
          one of the peers in its neighbor table and sends it a ROUTE-QUERY
          message with the destination_object set to the peer-id/resource-id
          it wishes to route to. The neighbor responds with the next peer-id
          to send to. The sending peer then CONNECTs to that peer and repeats
          the ROUTE-QUERY. Eventually, the sender gets a response from a peer
          containing a peer-id that is the same as that peer. At that point,
          the sender can send whatever request is needed directly to that
          peer.
</p>
<p>Note that this procedure only works well if all the peers are
          mutually directly reachable--either by all having public IP
          addresses or at least by all being behind the same NAT. Accordingly,
          peers MUST only use this method if permitted by the overlay
          configuration (see <a class='info' href='#sec-configuration'>Section&nbsp;10.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overlay Configuration</span><span>)</span></a>).

ICE and Connection Formation</h3>

<p>At numerous times during the operation of RELOAD, a node will need to
      establish a connection to another node. This may be for the purposes of
      building finger tables when the node joins the P2P network, or when the
      node learns of a new neighbor through an UPDATE and needs to establish a
      connection to that neighbor.
</p>
<p>In addition, a node may need to connect to another node for the
      purposes of an application connection. In the case of SIP, when a node
      has looked up the target AOR in the DHT, it will obtain a Node-ID that
      identifies that peer. The next step will be to establish a "direct"
      connection for the purposes of performing SIP signaling.
</p>
<p>In both of these cases, the node starts with a destination Node-ID,
      and its objective is to create a connection (ideally using TCP, but
      falling back to UDP when it is not available) to the node with that
      given Node-ID. The establishment of this connection is done using the
      CONNECT request in conjunction with ICE. It is assumed that the reader
      has familiarity with ICE.
</p>
<p>RELOAD implementations MUST implement full ICE. Because RELOAD always
      tries to use TCP and then UDP as a fallback, there will be multiple
      candidates of the same IP version, which requires full ICE.

<a name="rfc.section.8.1"></a><h3>8.1.&nbsp;
Overview</h3>

<p>To utilize ICE, the CONNECT method provides a basic offer/answer
        operation that exchanges a set of candidates for a single "stream". In
        this case, the "stream" refers not to RTP or other types of media, but
        rather to a connection for RELOAD itself or for SIP signaling. The
        CONNECT request contains the candidates for this stream, and the
        CONNECT response contains the corresponding answer with candidates for
        that stream. Though CONNECT provides an offer/answer exchange, it does
        not actually carry or utilize Session Description Protocol (SDP)
        messages. Rather, it carries the raw ICE parameters required for ICE
        operation, and the ICE spec is utilized as if these parameters had
        actually been used in an SDP offer or answer. In essence, ICE is
        utilized by mapping the CONNECT parameters into an SDP for the
        purposes of following the details of ICE itself. That avoids the need
        for RELOAD to respecify ICE, yet allows it to operate without the
        baggage that SDP would bring.
</p>
<p>In addition, RELOAD only allows for a single offer/answer exchange.
        Unlike the usage of ICE within SIP, there is never a need to send a
        subsequent offer to update the default candidates to match the ones
        selected by ICE.

Collecting STUN Servers</h3>

<p>ICE relies on the node having one or more STUN servers to use. In
        conventional ICE, it is assumed that nodes are configured with one or
        more STUN servers through some out-of-band mechanism. This is still
        possible in RELOAD but RELOAD also learns STUN servers as it connects
        to other peers. Because all RELOAD peers implement ICE and use STUN
        keepalives, every peer is a STUN server<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;rfc3489bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Session Traversal Utilities for (NAT) (STUN),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. Accordingly, any peer you
        know about will be willing to be a STUN server for you -- though of
        course it may be behind a NAT.
</p>
<p>A peer on a well-provisioned wide-area overlay will be configured
        with one or more bootstrap peers. These peers make an initial list of
        STUN servers. However, as the peer forms connections with additional
        peers, it builds more peers it can use as STUN servers.
</p>
<p>Because complicated NAT topologies are possible, a peer may need
        more than one STUN server. Specifically, a peer that is behind a
        single NAT will typically observe only two IP addresses in its STUN
        checks: its local address and its server reflexive address from a STUN
        server outside its NAT. However, if there are more NATs involved, it
        may discover that it learns additional server reflexive addresses
        (which vary based on where in the topology the STUN server is). To
        maximize the chance of achieving a direct connection, A peer SHOULD
        group other peers by the peer-reflexive addresses it discovers through
        them. It SHOULD then select one peer from each group to use as a STUN
        server for future connections.
</p>
<p>Only peers to which the peer currently has connections may be used.
        If the connection to that host is lost, it MUST be removed from the
        list of stun servers and a new server from the same group SHOULD be
        selected.
</p>
<p>OPEN ISSUE: should the peer try to keep at least one peer in each
        group, even if it has no other reason for the connection? Need to
        specify when to stop adding new groups if the peer is behind a really
        bad NAT.
</p>
<p>OPEN ISSUE: RELOAD-01 had a Peer-Info structure that allowed peers
        to exchange information such as a "default" IP-port pair in UPDATEs.
        This structure could be expanded to include the candidate list for a
        peer, thus allowing ICE negotiation to begin or even direct
        communication before a CONNECT request has been received. (The
        candidate pairs for the P2P port are fixed because the same source
        port is used for all connections.) However, because this would require
        significant changes to the ICE algorithm, we have not introduced such
        an extension at this point.

Gathering Candidates</h3>

<p>When a node wishes to establish a connection for the purposes of
        RELOAD signaling or SIP signaling (or any other application protocol
        for that matter), it follows the process of gathering candidates as
        described in Section 4 of ICE <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for           Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer           Protocols,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. RELOAD utilizes a single
        component, as does SIP. Consequently, gathering for these "streams"
        requires a single component.
</p>
<p>An agent MUST implement ICE-tcp <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for           Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer           Protocols,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, and MUST gather at least one UDP
        and one TCP host candidate for RELOAD and for SIP.
</p>
<p>The ICE specification assumes that an ICE agent is configured with,
        or somehow knows of, TURN and STUN servers. RELOAD provides a way for
        an agent to learn these by querying the ring, as described in <a class='info' href='#sec-collect'>Section&nbsp;8.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Collecting STUN Servers</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#sec-stun-turn-usage'>Section&nbsp;11.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>TURN Usage</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The agent SHOULD prioritize its TCP-based candidates over its
        UDP-based candidates in the prioritization described in Section 4.1.2
        of ICE <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for           Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer           Protocols,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The default candidate selection described in Section 4.1.3 of ICE
        is ignored; defaults are not signaled or utilized by RELOAD.

<a name="rfc.section.8.4"></a><h3>8.4.&nbsp;
Encoding the CONNECT Message</h3>

<p>Section 4.3 of ICE describes procedures for encoding the SDP.
        Instead of actually encoding an SDP, the candidate information (IP
        address and port and transport protocol, priority, foundation,
        component ID, type and related address) is carried within the
        attributes of the CONNECT request or its response. Similarly, the
        username fragment and password are carried in the CONNECT message or
        its response. <a class='info' href='#sec-connect-details'>Section&nbsp;7.1.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>CONNECT</span><span>)</span></a> describes the
        detailed attribute encoding for CONNECT. The CONNECT request and its
        response do not contain any default candidates or the ice-lite
        attribute, as these features of ICE are not used by RELOAD. The
        CONNECT request and its response also contain a Next-Protocol
        attribute, with a value of SIP or RELOAD, which indicates what
        protocol is to be run over the connection. The RELOAD CONNECT request
        MUST only be utilized to set up connections for application protocols
        that can be multiplexed with STUN and RELOAD itself.
</p>
<p>Since the CONNECT request contains the candidate information and
        short term credentials, it is considered as an offer for a single
        media stream that happens to be encoded in a format different than
        SDP, but is otherwise considered a valid offer for the purposes of
        following the ICE specification. Similarly, the CONNECT response is
        considered a valid answer for the purposes of following the ICE
        specification.
</p>
<p>Since all messages with RELOAD are secured between nodes, the node
        MUST implement the fingerprint attribute of RFC 4572 <a class='info' href='#RFC4572'>[RFC4572]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lennox, J., &ldquo;Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the Transport Layer           Security (TLS) Protocol in the Session Description Protocol           (SDP),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, and encode it into the CONNECT request and
        response as described in <a class='info' href='#sec-connect-details'>Section&nbsp;7.1.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>CONNECT</span><span>)</span></a>.
        This fingerprint will be matched with the certificates utilized to
        authenticate the RELOAD CONNECT request and its response.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the node MUST implement the active, passive, and actpass
        attributes from RFC 4145 <a class='info' href='#RFC4145'>[RFC4145]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Yon, D. and G. Camarillo, &ldquo;TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description Protocol           (SDP),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. However, here
        they refer strictly to the role of active or passive for the purposes
        of TLS handshaking. The TCP connection directions are signaled as part
        of the ICE candidate attribute.

Role Determination</h3>

<p>The roles of controlling and controlled as described in Section 5.2

        the answerer (the entity sending the CONNECT response) will always be
        controlled. The connectivity checks MUST still contain the
        ICE-CONTROLLED and ICE-CONTROLLING attributes, however, even though
        the role reversal capability for which they are defined will never be
        needed with RELOAD. This is to allow for a common codebase between ICE
        for RELOAD and ICE for SDP.

Concluding ICE</h3>

<p>The controlling agent MUST utilize regular nomination. This is to

        offer/answer exchanges.

<p>The procedures in Section 8 of ICE are followed to conclude ICE,
        with the following exceptions:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The controlling agent MUST NOT attempt to send an updated offer
            once the state of its single media stream reaches Completed.
</li>
<li>Once the state of ICE reaches Completed, the agent can
            immediately free all unused candidates. This is because RELOAD
            does not have the concept of forking, and thus the three second
            delay in Section 8.3 of ICE does not apply.

Sending Media</h3>

<p>The procedures of Section 11 apply to RELOAD as well. However, in
        this case, the "media" takes the form of application layer protocols
        (RELOAD or SIP for example) over TLS or DTLS. Consequently, once ICE
        processing completes, the agent will begin TLS or DTLS procedures to
        establish a secure connection. The fingerprint from the CONNECT
        request and its response are used as described in RFC 4572 <a class='info' href='#RFC4572'>[RFC4572]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lennox, J., &ldquo;Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the Transport Layer           Security (TLS) Protocol in the Session Description Protocol           (SDP),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, to ensure that another node in the P2P
        network, acting as a TURN server, has not inserted itself as a

<a name="rfc.section.9.2.1"></a><h3>9.2.1.&nbsp;
Overview</h3>

<p>The algorithm described here is a modified version of the Chord
          algorithm. Each peer keeps track of a finger table of 16 entries and
          a neighborhood table of 6 entries. The neighborhood table contains
          the 3 peers before this peer and the 3 peers after it in the DHT
          ring. The first entry in the finger table contains the peer half-way
          around the ring from this peer; the second entry contains the peer
          that is 1/4 of the way around; the third entry contains the peer
          that is 1/8th of the way around, and so on. Fundamentally, the chord
          data structure can be thought of a doubly-linked list formed by
          knowing the successors and predecessor peers in the neighborhood
          table, sorted by the peer-id. As long as the successor peers are
          correct, the DHT will return the correct result. The pointers to the
          prior peers are kept to enable inserting of new peers into the list
          structure. Keeping multiple predecessor and successor pointers makes
          it possible to maintain the integrity of the data structure even
          when consecutive peers simultaneously fail. The finger table forms a
          skip list, so that entries in the linked list can rapidly be found -
          it needs to be there so that peers can be found in O(log(N)) time
          instead of the typical O(N) time that a linked list would
          provide.
</p>
<p>A peer, n, is responsible for a particular Resource-ID k if k is
          less than or equal to n and k is greater than p, where p is the peer
          id of the previous peer in the neighborhood table. Care must be
          taken when computing to note that all math is modulo 2^128.

Routing</h3>

<p>If a peer is not responsible for a Resource-ID k, then it routes
          a request to that location by routing it to the peer in either the

Redundancy </h3>

<p>When a peer receives a STORE request for Resource-ID k, and it is
          responsible for Resource-ID k, it stores the data and returns a
          SUCCESS response. [[Open Issue: should it delay sending this SUCCESS
          until it has successfully stored the redundant copies?]]. It then
          sends a STORE request to its successor in the neighborhood table and
          to that peers successor. Note that these STORE requests are
          addressed to those specific peers, even though the Resource-ID they
          are being asked to store is outside the range that they are
          responsible for. The peers receiving these check they came from an
          appropriate predecessor in their neighborhood table and that they
          are in a range that this predecessor is responsible for, and then
          they store the data.
</p>
<p>Note that a malicious node can return a success response but not
          store the data locally or in the replica set. Requesting peers which
          wish to ensure that the replication actually occurred SHOULD contact
          each peer listed in the replicas field of the STORE response and
          retrieve a copy of the data. [[TODO: Do we want to have some
          optimization in FETCH where they can retrieve just a digest instead
          of the data values?]]

              peer (AP) for peer-id n. The AP sends the response to the
              JOIN.
</li>
<li>AP does a series of STORE requests to JP to store the data
              that JP will be responsible for.
</li>
<li>AP sends JP an UPDATE explicitly labeling JP as its
              predecessor. At this point, JP is part of the ring and
              responsible for a section of the overlay. AP can now forget any
              data which is assigned to JP and not AP.
</li>
<li>AP sends an UPDATE to all of its neighbors with the new
              values of its neighbor set (including JP).
</li>
<li>JP sends UPDATES to all the peers in its routing table.
</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to populate its routing table, JP sends a PING via the
          bootstrap node directed at resource-id n+1 (directly after its own
          resource-id). This allows it to discover its own successor. Call
          that node p0. It then sends a ping to p0+1 to discover its successor
          (p1). This process can be repeated to discover as many successors as
          desired. The values for the two peers before p will be found at a
          later stage when n receives an UPDATE.
</p>
<p>In order to set up its neighbor table entry for peer i, JP simply
          sends a CONNECT to peer (n+2^(numBitsInPeerId-i). This will be
          routed to a peer in approximately the right location around the
          ring.

Routing CONNECTs</h3>

<p>When a peer needs to CONNECT with a new peer in its neighborhood
          table, it MUST source-route the CONNECT request through the peer
          from which it learned the new peer's peer-id. Source-routing these
          requests allows the overlay to recover from instability.
</p>
<p>All other CONNECT requests, such as those for new finger table
          entries, are routed conventionally through the overlay.
</p>
<p>If a peer is unable to successfully CONNECT with a peer that
          should be in its neighborhood, it MUST locate either a TURN server
          or another peer in the overlay, but not in its neighborhood, through
          which it can exchange messages with its neighbor peer

Sending UPDATEs</h3>

<p>Every time a connection to a peer in the neighborhood set is
            lost (as determined by connectivity pings or failure of some
            request), the peer should remove the entry from its neighborhood
            table and replace it with the best match it has from the other
            peers in its routing table. It then sends an UPDATE to all its
            remaining neighbors. The update will contain all the peer-ids of
            the current entries of the table (after the failed one has been
            removed). Note that when replacing a successor the peer SHOULD
            delay the creation of new replicas for 30 seconds after removing
            the failed entry from its neighborhood table in order to allow a
            triggered update to inform it of a better match for its
            neighborhood table.
</p>
<p>If connectivity is lost to all three of the peers that succeed
            this peer in the ring, then this peer should behave as if it is
            joining the network and use PINGs to find a peer and send it a
            JOIN. If connectivity is lost to all the peers in the finger
            table, this peer should assume that it has been disconnected from
            the rest of the network, and it should periodically try to join
            the DHT.

Receiving UPDATEs</h3>

<p>When a peer, N, receives an UPDATE request, it examines the
            peer-ids in the UPDATE_Q and at its neighborhood table and decides
            if this UPDATE_Q would change its neighborhood table. This is done
            by taking the set of peers currently in the neighborhood table and
            comparing them to the peers in the update request. There are three
            major cases:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The UPDATE_Q contains peers that would not change the
                neighbor set because they match the neighborhood table.
</li>
<li>The UPDATE_Q contains peers closer to N than those in its
                neighborhood table.
</li>
<li>The UPDATE_Q defines peers that indicate a neighborhood
                table further away from N than some of its neighborhood table.
                Note that merely receiving peers further away does not
                demonstrate this, since the update could be from a node far
                away from N. Rather, the peers would need to bracket N.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first case, no change is needed.
</p>
<p>In the second case, N MUST attempt to CONNECT to the new peers
            and if it is successful it MUST adjust its neighbor set
            accordingly. Note that it can maintain the now inferior peers as
            neighbors, but it MUST remember the closer ones.
</p>
<p>The third case implies that a neighbor has disappeared, most
            likely because it has simply been disconnected but perhaps because
            of overlay instability. N MUST PING the questionable peers to
            discover if they are indeed missing and if so, remove them from
            its neighborhood table.
</p>
<p>After any PINGs and CONNECTs are done, if the neighborhood
            table changes, the peer sends an UPDATE request to each of its
            neighbors that was in either the old table or the new table. These
            UPDATE requests are what ends up filling in the
            predecessor/successor tables of peers that this peer is a neighbor
            to. A peer MUST NOT enter itself in its successor or predecessor
            table and instead should leave the entries empty.
</p>
<p>A peer N which is responsible for a resource-id R discovers
            that the replica set for R (the next two nodes in its successor
            set) has changed, it MUST send a STORE for any data associated
            with R to any new node in the replica set. It SHOULD not delete
            data from peers which have left the replica set.
</p>
<p>When a peer N detects that it is no longer in the replica set
            for a resource R (i.e., there are three predecessors between N and
            R), it SHOULD delete all data associated with R from its local
            store.

Stabilization</h3>

<p>There are four components to stabilization: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>exchange UPDATES will all peers in its routing table to
                exchange state
</li>
<li>search for better peers to place in its finger table
</li>
<li>search to determine if the current finger table size is
                sufficiently large
</li>
<li>search to determine if the overlay has partitioned and
                needs to recover
</li>
</ol>

<p>A peer MUST periodically send an UPDATE request to every peer
            in its routing table. The purpose of this is to keep the
            predecessor and successor lists up to date and to detect
            connection failures. The default time is about every ten minutes,
            but the enrollment server SHOULD set this in the configuration
            document using the "chord-128-2-16+-update-frequency" element
            (denominated in seconds.) A peer SHOULD randomly offset these
            UPDATE requests so they do not occur all at once. If an UPDATE
            request fails or times out, the peer MUST mark that entry in the
            neighbor table invalid and attempt to reestablish a connection. If
            no connection can be established, the peer MUST attempt to
            establish a new peer as its neighbor and do whatever replica set
            adjustments are required.
</p>
<p>Periodically a peer should select a random entry i from the
            finger table and do a PING to peer (n+2^(numBitsInPeerId-i). The
            purpose of this is to find a more accurate finger table entry if
            there is one. This is done less frequently than the connectivity
            checks in the previous section because forming new connections is
            somewhat expensive and the cost needs to be balanced against the
            cost of not having the most optimal finger table entries. The
            default time is about every hour, but the enrollment server SHOULD
            set this in the configuration document using the
            "chord-128-2-16+-ping-frequency" element (denominated in seconds).
            If this returns a different peer than the one currently in this
            entry of the peer table, then a new connection should be formed to
            this peer and it should replace the old peer in the finger
            table.
</p>
<p>As an overlay grows, more than 16 entries may be required in
            the finger table for efficient routing. To determine if its finger
            table is sufficiently large, one an hour the peer should perform a
            PING to determine whether growing its finger table by four entries
            would result in it learning at least two peers that it does not
            already have in its neighbor table. If so, then the finger table
            SHOULD be grown by four entries. Similarly, if the peer observes
            that its closest finger table entries are also in its neighbor
            table, it MAY shrink its finger table to the minimum size of 16
            entries. [[OPEN ISSUE: there are a variety of algorithms to gauge
            the population of the overlay and select an appropriate finger
            table size. Need to consider which is the best combination of
            effectiveness and simplicity.]]
</p>
<p>To detect that a partitioning has occurred and to heal the
            overlay, a peer P MUST periodically repeat the discovery process
            used in the initial join for the overay to locate an appropriate
            bootstrap peer, B. If an overlay has multiple mechanisms for
            discovery it should randomly select a method to locate a bootstrap
            peer. P should then send a PING for its own peer-ID routed through
            B. If a response is received from a peer S', which is not P's
            successor, then the overlay is partitioned and P should send a
            CONNECT to S' routed through B, followed by an UPDATE sent to S'.
            (Note that S' may not be in P's neighborhood table once the
            overlay is healed, but the connection will allow S' to discover
            appropriate neighbor entries for itself via its own
            stabilization.)

Discovery</h3>

<p>When a peer first joins a new overlay, it starts with a discovery
        process to find an enrollment server. Related work to the approach
        used here is described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.garcia-p2psip-dns-sd-bootstrapping'>[I&#8209;D.garcia&#8209;p2psip&#8209;dns&#8209;sd&#8209;bootstrapping]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Garcia, G., &ldquo;P2PSIP bootstrapping using DNS-SD,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#I-D.matthews-p2psip-bootstrap-mechanisms'>[I&#8209;D.matthews&#8209;p2psip&#8209;bootstrap&#8209;mechanisms]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cooper, E., &ldquo;Bootstrap Mechanisms for P2PSIP,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. The peer
        first determines the overlay name. This value is provided by the user
        or some other out of band provisioning mechanism. If the name is an IP
        address, that is directly used otherwise the peer MUST do a DNS SRV
        query using a Service name of "p2p_enroll" and a protocol of tcp to
        find an enrollment server.
</p>
<p>If the overlay name ends in .local, then the DNS SRV lookup is done
        using implement <a class='info' href='#I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd'>[I&#8209;D.cheshire&#8209;dnsext&#8209;dns&#8209;sd]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Krochmal, M. and S. Cheshire, &ldquo;DNS-Based Service Discovery,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> with
        a Service name of "p2p_menroll" can also be tried to find an
        enrollment server. If they implement this, the user name can be used
        as the Instance Identifier label.
</p>
<p>Once an address for the enrollment servers is determined, the peer
        forms an HTTPS connection to that IP address. The certificate MUST
        match the overlay name as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC2818'>[RFC2818]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rescorla, E., &ldquo;HTTP Over TLS,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>.
        The peer then performs a GET to the URL formed by appending a path of
        "/p2psip/enroll" to the overlay name. For example, if the overlay name
        was example.com, the URL would be
        "https://example.com/p2psip/enroll".

Credentials for HIP</h3>

<p>When RELOAD is used with HIP, the certificates MUST be generated

<ul class="text">
<li>Each node is assigned a unique ORCHID.
</li>
<li>The peer-id can be uniquely determined from the ORCHID.

<p>In addition to the usual attributes, when HIP is in use
          certificates MUST contain a subjectAltName with an iPAddress value

Locating a Peer</h3>

<p>In order to join the overlay, the peer MUST contact a peer.
        Typically this means contacting the bootstrap peers, since they are
        guaranteed to have public IP addresses (the system should not
        advertise them as bootstrap peers otherwise). If the peer has cached
        peers it SHOULD contact them first by sending a PING request to the
        known peer address with the destination peer-id set to that peer's
        peer-id.
</p>
<p>If no cached peers are available, then the peer SHOULD send a PING
        request to the address and port found in the broadcast-peers element
        in the configuration document. This MAY be a multicast or anycast
        address. The PING should use the wildcard peer-id as the destination
        peer-id.
</p>
<p>The responder peer that receives the PING request SHOULD check that
        the overlay name is correct and that the requester peer sending the
        request has appropriate credentials for the overlay before responding
        to the PING request even if the response is only an error.
</p>
<p>When the requester peer finally does receive a response from some
        responding peer, it can note the peer-id in the response and use this
        peer-id to start sending requests to join the DHT as described in
        <a class='info' href='#sec-join-leave-maint'>Section&nbsp;3.1.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Joining, Leaving, and Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#sec-dht-maint'>Section&nbsp;7.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>DHT Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>After a peer has successfully joined the overlay network, it SHOULD
        periodically look at any peers to which it has managed to form direct
        connections. Some of these peers MAY be added to the cached-peers list
        and used in future boots. Peers that are not directly connected MUST
        NOT be cached. The RECOMMENDED number of peers to cache is 10.

GRUUs</h3>

<p>GRUUs do not require storing data in the DHT. Rather, they are
          constructed by embedding a base64-encoded destination list in the gr
          URI parameter of the GRUU. The base64 encoding is done with the
          alphabet specified in table 1 of RFC 4648 with the exception that ~
          is used in place of =. An example GRUU is
          "sip:alice@example.com;gr=MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3ODk~". When a peer
          needs to route a message to a GRUU in the same P2P network, it
          simply uses the destination list and connects to that peer.
</p>
<p>Anonymous GRUUs are done in roughly the same way but require
          either that the enrollment server issue a different peer-id for each
          anonymous GRUU required or that a destination list be used that
          includes a peer that compresses the destination list to stop the

SIP Connect</h3>

<p>Once the destination list for a user has been identified, the

          contain the connect-application value of 5160 (SIP). If

SIP Tunnel</h3>

<p>This usage allows two peers to exchange SIP messages across the
          overlay using the TUNNEL method. TUNNEL is provided as an
          alternative to using CONNECT because it allows a SIP message to be
          sent immediately, without the delay associated with CONNECT. For a
          simple SIP exchange, it may result in fewer messages being sent.
</p>
<p>An implementation SHOULD use CONNECT for a dialog that is
          expected to endure for sufficient time and exchange significant
          numbers of messages. An implementation MAY establish an initial
          dialog using TUNNELing and then migrate it to a direct dialog opened
          with CONNECT once that negotiation is complete.
</p>
<p>As an application of TUNNEL, this usage defines the following
          items:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>For SIP, the application attribute is 5060.
</li>
<li>The application MAY establish any dialog using TUNNEL if it
              expects to replace it once a CONNECT request completes. The
              application SHOULD NOT exchange messages with another SIP UA
              repeatedly using a TUNNEL unless it is unable to complete a
              CONNECT.
</li>
<li>The Replaces header should be used to migrate dialogs
              established via TUNNEL to a direct connection.
</li>
<li>The dialogid is the GRUU of the destination of the
              request.
</li>
<li>By using the GRUU of the destination as the dialogid, the
              receiving peer is able to deliver the message to the appropriate
              process without parsing the SIP message.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In constructing the message, the SIP UA forms the message as if
          it were being routed directly to the GRUU of the destination. The
          SIP stack hands the message to RELOAD for delivery. Although the
          message is passed through a sequence of untrusted peers, it is not
          subject to modification by those peers because of the message's
          signature.
</p>
<p>OPEN ISSUE: should specify how to request encryption of the
          message end-to-end.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Note:</dt>
<dd>The easiest implementation of TUNNEL is
              likely to default to sending all messages across a TUNNEL when
              the first message is sent to a new destination GRUU and
              simultaneously issuing a CONNECT. Messages then continue through
              the TUNNEL until the CONNECT completes, at which point they are
              delivered via the new connection.

<p>OPEN ISSUE: If the tunneling vs direct decision can be made
          equivalently to a link-layer decision, it may not be necessary to

TURN Usage</h3>

<p>When a node starts up, it joins the overlay network and forms
        several connection in the process. If the ICE stage in any of these
        connection return a reflexive address that is not the same as the
        peers perceived address, then the peers is behind a NAT and not an
        candidate for a TURN server. Additionally, if the peers IP address is
        in the private address space range, then it is not a candidate for a
        TURN server. Otherwise, the peer SHOULD assume it is a potential TURN
        server and follow the procedures below.
</p>
<p>If the node is a candidate for a TURN server it will insert some
        pointers in the overlay so that other peers can find it. The overlay
        configuration file specifies a turnDensity parameter that indicates
        how many times each TURN server should record itself in the overlay.
        Typically this should be set to the reciprocal of the estimate of what
        percentage of peers will act as TURN servers. For each value, called
        d, between 1 and turnDensity, the peer forms a Unhashed-ID by
        concatenating its peer-ID and the value d. This Unhashed-ID is hashed
        to form a Resource-ID. The address of the peer is stored at that
        Resource-ID using type TURN-SERVICE and the turn-server
        production:

</p>
<p>Peers can find other servers by selecting a random Resource-ID and

        Resource-ID. The FIND request gets routed to a random peer based on
        the Resource-ID. If that peer knows of any servers, they will be
        returned. The returned response may be empty if the peer does not know
        of any servers, in which case the process gets repeated with some
        other random Resource-ID. As long as the ratio of servers relative to
        peers is not too low, this approach will result in finding a server
        relatively quickly.

Certificate Store Usage</h3>

<p>The Certificate Store usage allows a peer to store its certificate
        in the overlay, thus avoiding the need to send a certificate in each
        message - a reference may be sent instead.
</p>
<p>A user/peer MUST store its certificate at resource-ids derived from
        two Unhashed-IDs:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The user names in the certificate.
</li>
<li>The peer-ids in the certificate.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in the second case the certificate is not stored at the
        peer's peer-id but rather at a hash of the peer's peer-id. The
        intention here (as is common throughout RELOAD) is to avoid making a
        peer responsible for its own data.
</p>
<p>A peer MUST ensure that the user's certificates are stored in the
        DHT when joining and redo the check about every 24 hours after that.
        Certificate data should be stored with an expiry time of 60 days. When
        a client is checking the existence of data, if the expiry is less than
        30 days, it should be refreshed to have an expiry of 60 days. The
        certificate information is frequently used for many operations, and
        peers should cache it for 8 hours.

Diagnostic Usage</h3>

<p>[[TODO: reduce text of motivation description in the next
        version]]
</p>
<p>The development and deployment of a peer-to-peer system is a
        continuous process. The developers write code which is tested on a
        scale that may be smaller than the actual deployment size. After this
        local testing, the code is deployed in a real environment. Bugs arise
        during development and deployment phases. The designers of the
        peer-to-peer system need mechanisms which can help identify problems
        and bugs in a peer-to-peer system during development and deployment
        phases. Peer-to-peer systems are an example of a distributed system
        and it is not a trivial task to provide protocol mechanisms, tools and
        techniques to identify problems that may arise in such systems.
</p>
<p>The diagnostic mechanisms can broadly be classified into online and
        offline mechanisms. The online mechanisms attempt to identify faults
        in a running system where as offline mechanisms try to infer faults by
        gathering the log files of machines participating in a distributed
        system.
</p>
<p>In a peer-to-peer system, a peer maintains routing state to forward
        messages according to the overlay protocol being used. In addition, a
        peer stores information published by other peers. The routing and
        storage of resources consume network, space (memory), and CPU
        resources. A peer also needs to keep track of how long the P2PSIP
        application has been running and the last time peers in the routing
        table were last contacted. During development and deployment phase, an
        overlay designer needs mechanisms to query some or all of the above
        mentioned information.
</p>
<p>The overlay designer may also treat overlay as a black box and
        determine if the routing mechanisms are working correctly under
        various levels of churn.
</p>
<p>Thus, there are at least two types of online diagnostic mechanisms:
        1) state acquisition 2) black-box diagnostics

<a name="rfc.section.11.6.1"></a><h3>11.6.1.&nbsp;
State Acquisition Mechanisms</h3>

<p>The protocol provides a DIAGNOSTIC method [TODO] which queries
          the peer for its routing state, average bandwidth, CPU utilization,
          and storage state. The DIAGNOSTIC request should typically be sent
          over a reliable transport protocol as the response will likely
          exceed UDP MTU size. The state acquisition mechanism can be used to
          construct a local view of the connectivity state of the system. It
          can also be used to construct a geographical map of the system.
</p>
<p>Below, we identify potential issues with the state acquisition
          mechanisms.
</p>
<p>Security: If any peer can query the routing or storage state of
          any other peer, then clearly privacy and security concerns arise. To
          address this, the state acquisition mechanisms need an access list
          like mechanism so that only the overlay implementer can query the
          state of all the nodes. Alternatively, the state acquisition
          mechanisms are only enabled during the development phase or are only
          enabled for 'admin' users.
</p>
<p>Scalability: It is possible to query the state of few hundred or
          a few thousand nodes (as it is currently done in our live system on
          Planet lab); however, a serial state acquisition of a million node
          is a non starter. In large scale networks, one option is to query
          the state of few hundred nodes and to construct an high level
          connectivity map. CAIDA [ref] collects data at a few vantage points
          to construct BGP maps.
</p>
<p>Instantaneous vs. long term state: Another issue with these state
          acquisitions mechanisms is whether they acquire the instantaneous
          state snapshot or an exponential moving average or a list of
          snapshots over a period of time. For diagnostic metrics such as CPU
          utilization, an exponential moving average metric is also helpful in
          addition to the instantaneous snapshot.
</p>
<p>Pull vs. push: The state acquisition mechanisms can either be
          pull-based or push-based or a combination of both. In pull-based
          mechanisms, peer explicitly request state of another peer. This may
          not be sufficient because pull-based mechanisms require a to
          periodically poll a peer for any change state. In a push-based
          mechanism, peers advertise any change in certain metrics to their
          routing or neighbor peers. As an example of push-based mechanism, a
          peer which starts to relay a call may indicate a change in its
          bandwidth to its routing or neighbor peers in a PING message.
</p>
<p>Development vs. deployment: A hard problem is to decide which
          diagnostics are absolutely necessary during deployment and which are
          needed during development.
</p>
<p>Clearly, complete state acquisition has security concerns in a
          deployed system. The other option an overlay implementer can use is
          to run a few peers and have complete control over the functionality
          of these peers. These peers are same as other peers with the
          difference that an overlay implementer can explicitly query the
          state of these peers. It can then use this information to 'crawl'
          the overlay network and construct a local map of the network.

Black-box diagnostics</h3>

<p>[[TODO: a better name for this section]]
</p>
<p>Black-box diagnostics: DHTs are examples of structured
          peer-to-peer networks and they allow nodes to store key/value pairs
          in the overlay. A simple diagnostic mechanism is to treat the
          overlay as a black-box: publish several key/value pairs at one peer
          and then look them up from another peer. For this kind of diagnostic
          mechanism, clients are more suitable as they do not provide any
          routing or storage services to the overlay and can connect to an
          arbitrary peer.
</p>
<p>The Diagnostic Usage allow a peer to report various statistics
        about itself that may be useful for diagnostics or performance
        management. It can be used to discover information such as the
        software version, uptime, and performance statistics of a peer. The
        usage defines several new kinds which can be retrieved to get the
        statistics. The peer-id is directly used when retrieving data so no
        Unhashed-ID is defined. The access control model for all of these is
        local policy defined by the peer. The peer MAY have a list of users
        (such as "admin") that it is willing to return the information for and
        restrict access to users with that name. The access control can be
        determined on a per kind basis - for example, a node may be willing to
        return the software version to any users while specific information
        about performance may not be returned.

Diagnostic Metrics for a P2PSIP Deployment</h3>

<p>Clearly, all diagnostic metrics are useful during development and
          testing. The hard question is which metrics are absolutely necessary
          for a deployed P2PSIP system. We attempt to identify these metrics
          and classify them under 'resource' and 'peer' metrics.
</p>
<p>For 'resource' metric, we identify CPU_UTILIZATION,
          EWMA_BYTES_SENT, EWMA_BYTES_RCVD, and MEMORY_FOOTPRINT as the key
          metrics and for 'peer' metric we identify UPTIME, LAST_CONTACT, and
          RTT as the metrics that are crucial for a deployed P2PSIP
          system.
</p>
<p>(OPEN QUESTION: any other metrics?)
</p>
<p>(OPEN: Below, we sketch how these metrics can be used. A peer can
          use EWMA_BYTES_SENT and EWMA_BYTES_RCVD of another peer to infer

          forward any requests for media relay to this peer. Similarly, among
          the various candidates for filling up routing table, a peer may
          prefer a peer with a large UPTIME value, small RTT, and small
          LAST_CONTACT value. )

Overview</h3>

<p>RELOAD provides a generic storage service, albeit one designed to
        be useful for P2P SIP. In this section we discuss security issues that
        are likely to be relevant to any usage of RELOAD. In <a class='info' href='#section.sip-issues'>Section&nbsp;12.7<span> (</span><span class='info'>SIP-Specific Issues</span><span>)</span></a> we describe issues that are
        specific to SIP.
</p>
<p>In any DHT, any given user depends on a number of peers with which
        they have no well-defined relationship except that they are fellow
        members of the DHT. In practice, these other nodes may be friendly,
        lazy, curious, or outright malicious. No security system can provide
        complete protection in an environment where most nodes are malicious.
        The goal of security in RELOAD is to provide strong security
        guarantees of some properties even in the face of a large number of
        malicious nodes and to allow the DHT to function correctly in the face
        of a modest number of malicious nodes.
</p>
<p>P2PSIP deployments require the ability to authenticate both peers
        and resources (users) without the active presence of a trusted entity
        in the system. We describe two mechanisms. The first mechanism is
        based on public key certificates and is suitable for general
        deployments. The second is based on an overlay-wide shared symmetric
        key and is suitable only for limited deployments in which the
        relationship between admitted peers is not adversarial.

<a name="rfc.section.12.2"></a><h3>12.2.&nbsp;
Attacks on P2P Overlays</h3>

<p>The two basic functions provided by DHT nodes are storage and
        routing: some node is responsible for storing a peer's data and for
        allowing a peer to fetch other peer's data. Some other set of nodes
        are responsible for routing messages to and from the storing nodes.
        Each of these issues is covered in the following sections.
</p>
<p>P2P overlays are subject to attacks by subversive nodes that may
        attempt to disrupt routing, corrupt or remove user registrations, or
        eavesdrop on signaling. The certificate-based security algorithms we
        describe in this draft are intended to protect DHT routing and user
        registration information in RELOAD messages.
</p>
<p>To protect the signaling from attackers pretending to be valid
        peers (or peers other than themselves), the first requirement is to
        ensure that all messages are received from authorized members of the
        overlay. For this reason, RELOAD transports all messages over DTLS or
        TLS, which provides message integrity and authentication of the
        directly communicating peer. In addition, when the certificate-based
        security system is used, messages and data are digitally signed with
        the sender's private key, providing end-to-end security for
        communications.

<a name="rfc.section.12.3"></a><h3>12.3.&nbsp;
Certificate-based Security</h3>

<p>This specification stores users' registrations and possibly other
        data in a Distributed Hash table (DHT). This requires a solution to
        securing this data as well as securing, as well as possible, the
        routing in the DHT. Both types of security are based on requiring that
        every entity in the system (whether user or peer) authenticate
        cryptographically using an asymmetric key pair tied to a
        certificate.
</p>
<p>When a user enrolls in the DHT, they request or are assigned a
        unique name, such as "alice@dht.example.net". These names are unique
        and are meant to be chosen and used by humans much like a SIP Address
        of Record (AOR) or an email address. The user is also assigned one or
        more peer-IDs by the central enrollment authority. Both the name and
        the peer ID are placed in the certificate, along with the user's
        public key.
</p>
<p>Each certificate enables an entity to act in two sorts of
        roles:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>As a user, storing data at specific Resource-IDs in the DHT
            corresponding to the user name.
</li>
<li>As a DHT peer with the peer ID(s) listed in the
            certificate.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that since only users of this DHT need to validate a
        certificate, this usage does not require a global PKI. It does,
        however, require a central enrollment authority which acts as the
        certificate authority for the DHT. This authority signs each peer's
        certificate. Because each peer possesses the CA's certificate (which
        they receive on enrollment) they can verify the certificates of the
        other entities in the overlay without further communication. Because
        the certificates contain the user/peer's public key, communications
        from the user/peer can be verified in turn.
</p>
<p>In order to protect data storage, in the certificate-based security
        scheme, all stored data is signed by the owner of the data. This
        allows the storing peer to verify that the storer is authorized to
        perform a store at that resource-id and also allows any consumer of
        the data to verify the provenance and integrity of the data when it
        retrieves it.
</p>
<p>All implementations MUST implement certificate-based security.

Shared-Secret Security</h3>

<p>For small environments where deployment of the PKI necessary to use
        a certificate-based model is impractical, RELOAD supports a shared
        secret security that relies on a single key that is shared among all
        members of the overlay. It is appropriate for small groups that wish
        to form a private network without complexity. In shared secret mode,
        all the peers share a single symmetric key which is used to key
        TLS-PSK <a class='info' href='#RFC4279'>[RFC4279]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eronen, P. and H. Tschofenig, &ldquo;Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security           (TLS),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> or TLS-SRP <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tls-srp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tls&#8209;srp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Taylor, D., &ldquo;Using SRP for TLS Authentication,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> mode. A peer which does not know the
        key cannot form TLS connections with any other peer and therefore
        cannot join the overlay.
</p>
<p>The shared-secret scheme prohibits unauthorized peers from joining
        the overlay, but it provides no protection from a compromised peer
        inserting arbitrary resource registrations, performing a Sybil
        attack<a class='info' href='#Sybil'>[Sybil]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Douceur, J., &ldquo;The Sybil Attack,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, or performing other attacks on the
        resources or routing. Thus, it is only safe to use in limited settings
        in which peers are not adversarial. In addition, because the messages
        and data are not authenticated, each intermediate peer MUST take care
        to use TLS and check the other peer's knowledge of the shared secret,
        or message insertion is possible.
</p>
<p>If the shared secret key for the shared-key security scheme is
        discovered by an attacker, then most of the security of the scheme is
        lost: an attacker can impersonate any peer to any other peer. Thus,
        the shared-secret scheme is only appropriate for small deployments,
        such as a small office or ad hoc overlay set up among participants in
        a meeting.
</p>
<p>One natural approach to a shared-secret scheme is to use a
        user-entered password as the key. The difficulty with this is that in
        TLS-PSK mode, such keys are very susceptible to dictionary attacks. If
        passwords are used as the source of shared-keys, then TLS-SRP is a
        superior choice because it is not subject to dictionary attacks.

Storage Security</h3>

<p>When certificate-based security is used in RELOAD, any given
        Resource-ID/kind-id pair (a slot) is bound to some small set of
        certificates. In order to write data in a slot, the writer must prove
        possession of the private key for one of those certificates. Moreover,
        all data is stored signed by the certificate which authorized its
        storage. This set of rules makes questions of authorization and data
        integrity - which have historically been thorny for DHTs - relatively
        simple.
</p>
<p>When shared-secret security is used, then all peers trust all other
        peers, provided that they have demonstrated that they have the
        credentials to join the overlay at all. The following text therefore
        applies only to certificate-based security.

<a name="rfc.section.12.5.1"></a><h3>12.5.1.&nbsp;
Authorization</h3>

<p>When a client wants to store some value in a slot, it first
          digitally signs the value with its own private key. It then sends a
          STORE request that contains both the value and the signature towards
          the storing peer (which is defined by the Unhashed-ID construction
          algorithm for that particular kind of value).
</p>
<p>When the storing peer receives the request, it must determine
          whether the storing client is authorized to store in this slot. In
          order to do so, it executes the Unhashed-ID construction algorithm
          for the specified kind based on the user's certificate information.
          It then computes the Resource-ID from the Unhashed-ID and verifies
          that it matches the slot which the user is requesting to write to.
          If it does, the user is authorized to write to this slot, pending
          quota checks as described in the next section.
</p>
<p>For example, consider the certificate with the following
          properties:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        User name: alice@dht.example.com
        Peer-Id:   013456789abcdef
        Serial:    1234
</pre></div>
<p>If Alice wishes to STORE a value of the "SIP Location" kind, the
          Unhashed-ID will be the SIP AOR "sip:alice@dht.example.com". The
          Resource-ID will be determined by hashing the Unhashed-ID. When a
          peer receives a request to store a record at Resource-ID X, it takes
          the signing certificate and recomputes the Unhashed-ID, in this case
          "alice@dht.example.com". If H("alice@dht.example.com")=X then the
          STORE is authorized. Otherwise it is not. Note that the Unhashed-ID
          construction algorithm may be different for other kinds.

<a name="rfc.section.12.5.2"></a><h3>12.5.2.&nbsp;
Distributed Quota</h3>

<p>Being a peer in a DHT carries with it the responsibility to store
          data for a given region of the DHT. However, if clients were allowed
          to store unlimited amounts of data, this would create unacceptable
          burdens on peers, as well as enabling trivial denial of service
          attacks. RELOAD addresses this issue by requiring each usage to
          define maximum sizes for each kind of stored data. Attempts to store
          values exceeding this size MUST be rejected (if peers are
          inconsistent about this, then strange artifacts will happen when the
          zone of responsibility shifts and a different peer becomes
          responsible for overlarge data). Because each slot is bound to a
          small set of certificates, these size restrictions also create a
          distributed quota mechanism, with the quotas administered by the
          central enrollment server.
</p>
<p>Allowing different kinds of data to have different size
          restrictions allows new usages the flexibility to define limits that
          fit their needs without requiring all usages to have expansive
          limits.

<a name="rfc.section.12.5.3"></a><h3>12.5.3.&nbsp;
Correctness</h3>

<p>Because each stored value is signed, it is trivial for any
          retrieving peer to verify the integrity of the stored value. Some
          more care needs to be taken to prevent version rollback attacks.
          Rollback attacks on storage are prevented by the use of store times
          and lifetime values in each store. A lifetime represents the latest
          time at which the data is valid and thus limits (though does not
          completely prevent) the ability of the storing node to perform a
          rollback attack on retrievers. In order to prevent a rollback attack
          at the time of the STORE request, we require that storage times be
          monotonically increasing. Storing peers MUST reject STORE requests
          with storage times smaller than or equal to those they are currently
          storing. In addition, a fetching node which receives a data value
          with a storage time older than the result of the previous fetch
          knows a rollback has occurred.

<a name="rfc.section.12.5.4"></a><h3>12.5.4.&nbsp;
Residual Attacks</h3>

<p>The mechanisms described here provide a high degree of security,
          but some attacks remain possible. Most simply, it is possible for
          storing nodes to refuse to store a value (i.e., reject any request).
          In addition, a storing node can deny knowledge of values which it
          previously accepted. To some extent these attacks can be ameliorated
          by attempting to store to/retrieve from replicas, but a retrieving
          client does not know whether it should try this or not, since there
          is a cost to doing so.
</p>
<p>Although the certificate-based authentication scheme prevents a
          single peer from being able to forge data owned by other peers.
          Furthermore, although a subversive peer can refuse to return data
          resources for which it is responsible it cannot return forged data
          because it cannot provide authentication for such registrations.
          Therefore parallel searches for redundant registrations can mitigate
          most of the affects of a compromised peer. The ultimate reliability
          of such an overlay is a statistical question based on the
          replication factor and the percentage of compromised peers.
</p>
<p>In addition, when a kind is is multivalued (e.g., an array data
          model), the storing node can return only some subset of the values,
          thus biasing its responses. This can be countered by using single
          values rather than sets, but that makes coordination between
          multiple storing agents much more difficult. This is a tradeoff that
          must be made when designing any usage.

Routing Security</h3>

<p>Because the storage security system guarantees (within limits) the
        integrity of the stored data, routing security focuses on stopping the
        attacker from performing a DOS attack on the system by misrouting
        requests in the DHT. There are a few obvious observations to make
        about this. First, it is easy to ensure that an attacker is at least a
        valid peer in the DHT. Second, this is a DOS attack only. Third, if a
        large percentage of the peers on the DHT are controlled by the
        attacker, it is probably impossible to perfectly secure against
        this.

<a name="rfc.section.12.6.1"></a><h3>12.6.1.&nbsp;
Background</h3>

<p>In general, attacks on DHT routing are mounted by the attacker
          arranging to route traffic through or two nodes it controls. In the
          Eclipse attack <a class='info' href='#Eclipse'>[Eclipse]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Singh, A., Ngan, T., Druschel, T., and D. Wallach, &ldquo;Eclipse Attacks on Overlay Networks: Threats and           Defenses,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> the attacker tampers
          with messages to and from nodes for which it is on-path with respect
          to a given victim node. This allows it to pretend to be all the
          nodes that are reachable through it. In the Sybil attack <a class='info' href='#Sybil'>[Sybil]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Douceur, J., &ldquo;The Sybil Attack,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, the attacker registers a large number of
          nodes and is therefore able to capture a large amount of the traffic
          through the DHT.
</p>
<p>Both the Eclipse and Sybil attacks require the attacker to be
          able to exercise control over her peer IDs. The Sybil attack
          requires the creation of a large number of peers. The Eclipse attack
          requires that the attacker be able to impersonate specific peers. In
          both cases, these attacks are limited by the use of centralized,
          certificate-based admission control.

<a name="rfc.section.12.6.2"></a><h3>12.6.2.&nbsp;
Admissions Control</h3>

<p>Admission to an RELOAD DHT is controlled by requiring that each
          peer have a certificate containing its peer ID. The requirement to
          have a certificate is enforced by using TLS mutual authentication on
          each connection. Thus, whenever a peer connects to another peer,
          each side automatically checks that the other has a suitable
          certificate. These peer IDs are randomly assigned by the central
          enrollment server. This has two benefits:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>It allows the enrollment server to limit the number of peer
              IDs issued to any individual user.
</li>
<li>It prevents the attacker from choosing specific peer IDs.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first property allows protection against Sybil attacks
          (provided the enrollment server uses strict rate limiting policies).
          The second property deters but does not completely prevent Eclipse
          attacks. Because an Eclipse attacker must impersonate peers on the
          other side of the attacker, he must have a certificate for suitable
          peer IDs, which requires him to repeatedly query the enrollment
          server for new certificates which only will match by chance. From
          the attacker's perspective, the difficulty is that if he only has a
          small number of certificates the region of the DHT he is
          impersonating appears to be very sparsely populated by comparison to
          the victim's local region.

<a name="rfc.section.12.6.3"></a><h3>12.6.3.&nbsp;
Peer Identification and Authentication</h3>

<p>In general, whenever a peer engages in DHT activity that might
          affect the routing table it must establish its identity. This
          happens in two ways. First, whenever a peer establishes a direct
          connection to another peer it authenticates via TLS mutual
          authentication. All messages between peers are sent over this
          protected channel and therefore the peers can verify the data origin
          of the last hop peer for requests and responses without further
          cryptography.
</p>
<p>In some situations, however, it is desirable to be able to
          establish the identity of a peer with whom one is not directly
          connected. The most natural case is when a peer UPDATEs its state.
          At this point, other peers may need to update their view of the DHT
          structure, but they need to verify that the UPDATE message came from
          the actual peer rather than from an attacker. To prevent this, all
          DHT routing messages are signed by the peer that generated them.
</p>
<p>[TODO: this allows for replay attacks on requests. There are two
          basic defenses here. The first is global clocks and loose
          anti-replay. The second is to refuse to take any action unless you
          verify the data with the relevant node. This issue is
          undecided.]
</p>
<p>[TODO: I think we are probably going to end up with generic
          signatures or at least optional signatures on all DHT messages.]

<a name="rfc.section.12.6.4"></a><h3>12.6.4.&nbsp;
Protecting the Signaling</h3>

<p>The goal here is to stop an attacker from knowing who is
          signaling what to whom. An attacker being able to observe the
          activities of a specific individual is unlikely given the
          randomization of IDs and routing based on the present peers
          discussed above. Furthermore, because messages can be routed using
          only the header information, the actual body of the RELOAD message
          can be encrypted during transmission.
</p>
<p>There are two lines of defense here. The first is the use of TLS
          or DTLS for each communications link between peers. This provides
          protection against attackers who are not members of the overlay. The
          second line of defense, if certificate-based security is used, is to
          digitally sign each message. This prevents adversarial peers from
          modifying messages in flight, even if they are on the routing
          path.

Residual Attacks</h3>

<p>The routing security mechanisms in RELOAD are designed to contain
          rather than eliminate attacks on routing. It is still possible for
          an attacker to mount a variety of attacks. In particular, if an
          attacker is able to take up a position on the DHT routing between A
          and B it can make it appear as if B does not exist or is
          disconnected. It can also advertise false network metrics in attempt
          to reroute traffic. However, these are primarily DoS attacks.
</p>
<p>The certificate-based security scheme secures the namespace, but
          if an individual peer is compromised or if an attacker obtains a
          certificate from the CA, then a number of subversive peers can still
          appear in the overlay. While these peers cannot falsify responses to
          resource queries, they can respond with error messages, effecting a
          DoS attack on the resource registration. They can also subvert
          routing to other compromised peers. To defend against such attacks,
          a resource search must still consist of parallel searches for
          replicated registrations.

Appendix: Notes on DHT Algorithm Selection</h3>

<p>An important point: if you assume NATs are doing ICE to set up
      connections, you want a lot fewer connections than you might have on a
      very open network - this might push towards something like Chord with
      fewer connections than, say, bamboo.
