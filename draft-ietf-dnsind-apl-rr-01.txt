Abstract

   The Domain Name System is primarily used to translate domain names
   into IPv4 addresses using A RRs. Several approaches exist to describe
   networks or address ranges. This document proposes a new DNS RR type
   "APL" for address prefix lists.

1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Domain names herein are for explanatory purposes only and should not
   be expected to lead to useful information in real life [TESTTLD].

2. Background

   The Domain Name System [RFC1034], [RFC1035] provides a mechanism to
   assign addresses and other internet infrastructure elements to
   hierarchically built domain names. Various types of resource records
   have been defined, especially those for IPv4 and IPv6 [RFC1886],
   [A6DNSRR] addresses.  In [RFC1101] a method is described to publish
   information about the address space allocated to an organisation. In
   older BIND versions, a weak form of controlling access to zone data
   was implemented using TXT RRs describing address ranges.

   This document proposes a new RR type for address prefix lists.

3. APL RR Type

   An APL record has the DNS type of "APL" [draft: not yet applied for]
   and a numeric value of [draft:to be assigned]. The APL RR is defined
   in the IN class only. APL RRs cause no additional section processing.

4. APL RDATA format

   The RDATA section consists of zero or more strings (<apstring>) of
   the form

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |                          ADDRESSFAMILY                        |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | N |          PREFIX           |  MBZ  |        AFDLENGTH      |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      /                            AFDPART                            /
      |                                                               |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                        the value "1" if the "!" was given, "0" else.

                        yet undefined address families and variable
                        length addresses.

      AFDPART           address family dependent part. See below.


   This document defines the AFDPARTs for address families 1 (IPv4) and
   2 (IPv6).  Future revisions may deal with additional address
   families.

4.1. AFDPART for IPv4

   The encoding of an IPv4 address (address family 1) follows the
   encoding specified for the A RR by [RFC1035], section 3.4.1.

   PREFIX specifies the number of bits of the IPv4 address starting at
   the most significant bit. Legal encodings range from 0 (1 bit) to 31
   (32 bit, complete address).

   An IPv4 AFDPART has a fixed length of 4 octets.

4.1. AFDPART for IPv6

   The encoding of an IPv6 address (address family 2) follows the
   encoding specified for the AAAA RR by [RFC1886], section 2.2.

   PREFIX specifies the number of bits of the IPv6 address starting at
   the most significant bit. Legal encodings range from 0 (1 bit) to 127
   (128 bit, complete address).

   An IPv6 AFDPART has a fixed length of 16 octets.

5. Zone File Syntax

   The textual representation of an APL RR in a DNS zone file is as
   follows:

      <owner>   IN   <TTL>   APL   {[!]address/prefix}*

   The data consists of zero or more strings of an address, immediately
   followed by the "/" character, immediately followed by a decimal
   numeric value for the prefix length. Any such string may be preceeded
   by a "!" character. The strings are separated by whitespace.

5.1. Textual Representation of IPv4 Addresses

   An IPv4 address in the <address> part of an <apstring> is in dotted
   quad notation, just as in an A RR.  The <prefix> has values from the
   interval 1..32 (decimal), corresponding to encodings 0..31.

5.1. Textual Representation of IPv6 Addresses

INTERNET-DRAFT                 DNS APL RR                  February 1999


   The representation of an IPv6 address in the <address> part of an
   <apstring> follows [RFC2373], section 2.2. Legal values for <prefix>
   are from the interval 1..128 (decimal), corresponding to encodings
   0..127.

6. APL RR usage

   An APL RR with empty RDATA is valid and implements an empty list.
   Multiple occurences of the same <apstring> in a single APL RR are
   allowed and MUST NOT be merged by a DNS server or resolver.
   <apstrings> must be kept in order and MUST NOT be rearranged or
   aggregated.

   A single APL RR may contain <apstrings> belonging to different
   address families.  The maximum number of <apstrings> is upperbounded
   by the available RDATA space.

   RRSets consisting of more than one APL RR are legal but the
   interpretation is left to the particular application. It may choose
   to join the lists or treat them as alternatives.

   Possible applications include the publication of address ranges
   similar to [RFC1101], description of zones built following [RFC2317]
   and in-band access control to limit general access or zone transfer
   (AXFR) availability for zone data held in DNS servers.

7. Examples

      foo.example              APL 192.168.32.0/21 !192.168.38.0/28

      42.168.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA  APL 192.168.42.0/26 192.168.42.64/26 \
                                   192.168.42.128/25

      _axfr_.sbo.example       APL 127.0.0.1/32 172.16.64.0/22

      multicast.example        APL 224.0.0.0/4  FF00:0:0:0:0:0:0:0/8

8. Security Considerations

   Any information obtained from the DNS should be regarded as unsafe
   unless techniques specified in [RFC2065] or [TSIGRR] were used. The
   definition of a new RR type does not introduce security problems into
   the DNS, but usage of information made available by APL RRs may
   compromise security. This includes disclosure of network topology
   information and in particular the use of APL RRs to construct access
   control lists.

9. IANA Considerations

   identifiers for address families maintained by IANA in
