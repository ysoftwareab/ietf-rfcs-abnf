1.  Introduction

   Modern video coding standards such as Thor [I-D.fuldseth-netvc-thor]
   include in-loop filters which correct artifacts introduced in the
   encoding process.  Thor includes a deblocking filter which correct
   artifacts introduced by the block based nature of the encoding
   process, and a low pass filter correcting artifacts not corrected by
   the deblocking filter, in particular artifacts introduced by
   quantisation errors of transform coefficients and by the
   interpolation filter.  Since in-loop filters have to be applied in
   both the encoder and decoder, it is highly desirable that these
   filters have low computational complexity.

                     Figure 1: Filter pixel positions

   In Thor the frames are divided into super blocks (SB) 64x64 pixels in
   size and each SB can be divided into smaller coding blocks (CB).

      SB: Super Block - 64x64 block (luma pixels) which can be divided
      into CBs.

      CB: Coding Block - Subdivision of a SB, down to 8x8 (luma pixels).

      PB: Prediction Block - Subdivision of a CB, into 1, 2 or 4 equal
      blocks.

      TB: Transform Block - Subdivision of a CB, into 1 or 4 equal
      blocks.

3.  Filtering Process

3.1.  General Approach

   Given a pixel X and its neighbouring pixels described above an index
   for a 2^8 (256) entry lookup table can be constructed by comparing X
   with each of its neighbours and organise the results into an 8 bit
   binary number.  For instance:


            I = (A>X)*2^0 + (B>X)*2^1 + (C>X)*2^2 + (D>X)*2^3 +
                (E>X)*2^4 + (F>X)*2^5 + (G>X)*2^6 + (H>X)*2^7


                           Figure 2: Equation 1

   Comparisons evaluate into 0 or 1.  Each entry in the lookup table
   contains an offset by which X is to be increased.  If this offset is
   1, it has always the effect of making X more like its neighbours,
   thus it effectively is a low pass filter.  If the offset is a number
   greater than 1, X may need to be clipped into its valid range.  The
   table is shared by the encoder and the decoder.  A simple way of
   constructing the table is to try different values for a single entry,

Internet-Draft         Constrained Low Pass Filter          October 2015


   set the others to 0 and find the value that gives the best
   improvement, if any, based on a squared error metric for a set of
   typical videos, and then repeat this process for every entry.

   If a neighbour pixel is outside the image frame, it is given the same
   value as X.  This rule can optionally be applied to block boundaries
   to allow blocks to be filtered independently in parallel with low
   memory requirements.

   The same table can be used when forming an index using the less-than
   operator instead:


      I = (A&lt;X)*2^0 + (B&lt;X)*2^1 + (C&lt;X)*2^2 + (D&lt;X)*2^3 +
          (E&lt;X)*2^4 + (F&lt;X)*2^5 + (G&lt;X)*2^6 + (H&lt;X)*2^7


                           Figure 3: Equation 2

   In this case the entries must be regarded as negative offsets.  That
   is, the offset by which X is to be decreased.

   The effectiveness of the filter depends on the contents of the video
   frame and how different parts of the frame were predicted.  In some
   cases the filter will have an adverse effect.  To counter this the
   encoder tests the effectiveness and signals whether to apply the
   filter at frame level or at block level or at both levels.  This
   signal, at frame level, block level or both, can also indicate which
   table to use in a set of different tables shared by the encoder and
   decoder.  A set of tables could be one table made up of only 0s and
   1s and the signal could be a scale factor for the entries which would
   eliminate the need of storing multiple tables.

   To reduce the signaling cost at block level the filter can be
   disabled implicitly for certain block types for which the filter is
   expected to have little or sometimes adverse effects, such as for
   blocks without residual information or for bi-predictive blocks
   (since the bi-predictive averaging have low pass properties).

3.2.  Simplification

   It can be noted that some simplifications of the filter can be
   reduced to simple equations, such as:

Internet-Draft         Constrained Low Pass Filter          October 2015


          X&apos; = X + ((B>X)+(D>X)+(E>X)+(G>X) > 2) -
                        ((B&lt;X)+(D&lt;X)+(E&lt;X)+(G&lt;X) > 2)


                           Figure 4: Equation 3

   This is equivalent to a table having 1 for the entries at 26, 74, 82,
   88, 90, and 0 for everything else.  This simplification, which is
   used by Thor, can be rephrased as follows:

   o  Every pixel is compared to the adjacent left, right, upper, lower
      pixel.

   o  If at least three of them are greater, the center pixel is
      increased by one.

   o  If at least three of them are smaller, the center pixel is
      decreased by one.

   Thor does not filter across SB borders and has a binary signal at
   frame and SB level as well as at sequence level.  Fully bi-predictive
   SBs are never filtered, nor uni-predictive if they lack residual
   information, and no signal is transmitted for these blocks.  Other
   SBs are filtered (unless filtering has been disabled at frame or
   sequence level), but individual CBs within a SB are unchanged if they
   are bi-predictive or lack residual information.  Note that B, D, E, G
   and X are the unfiltered values; the order in which the pixels are
   filtered does not matter.

   The filter is applied after the deblocking filter.

   The simplifications adopted by Thor reduce the computational
   complexity at a slight loss of compression effectiveness.

3.3.  Complexity Considerations

   Many modern computers have processors supporting SIMD (single
   instruction, multiple data) instructions, which perform the same
   operation on multiple data.  The filter in Thor is particularily
   suited for such architectures since multiple comparisons, additions
   and subtractions of pixels and results can be performed with single
   instructions.  The frame and block border restrictions can be
   implemented using a shuffle instruction, also frequently available in
   processors supporting SIMD instructions.

   Since the filter does not depend on any filtered pixels within the
   same frame, further parallelism can be achieved on multi core
   architectures.  And since there is no filtering across SB borders,

   the memory requirement for storing filtered values before copying
   them back into the original frame is very low.

4.  Performance

   The table below show filters effect on the bandwidth for a selection
   of 10 second video sequences encoded in Thor with uni-prediction
   only.  The numbers have been computed using the Bjontegaard Delta
   Rate (BDR).  BDR-low and BDR-high indicate the effect at low and bigh
   bitrates respectively.

             |Kimono          | -1.509% | -0.766% | -2.510% |
             |BasketballDrive | -2.860% | -1.571% | -4.514% |

             |ChangeSeats     | -4.744% | -1.900% | -8.280% |
             |HeadAndShoulder | -6.697% | -0.670% |-14.925% |

             |Average         | -4.176% | -1.686% | -7.386% |
             +----------------+---------+---------+---------+


          Figure 5: Compression Performance without Biprediction

   Whilst the filter objectively performs better at relatively high
   bitrates, the subjective effect seems better at relatively low
   bitrates, and overall the subjective effect seems better than what
   the objective numbers suggest.

   If bi-prediction is allowed, there is less bandwidth reduction as the
   table below shows.
