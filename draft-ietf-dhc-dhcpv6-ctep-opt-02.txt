Abstract

   For the newly deployed IPv6 networks to interoperate with vastly
   deployed IPv4 networks, various transition mechanisms had been
   proposed.  One such mechanism is configured tunnels.  This document
   provides a tunnel discovery mechanism by which the DHCPv6 servers can
   provide information about the available configured tunnel end points
   to reach the IPv6 nodes which are separated by IPv4 networks.

Internet-Draft     DHCPv6 Option for Tunnel Discovery       October 2005


1.  Introduction

   In the initial deployment of IPv6, the IPv6 nodes may need to
   communicate with the other IPv6 nodes via IPv4 networks.  Configured
   tunnels [RFC4213] provide a way to encapsulate the IPv6 packets in
   IPv4 packets and tunnel them in the IPv4 network.

   This document defines a new option called Configured Tunnel End Point
   by which the DHCPv6 [RFC3315] server can notify the client with the
   list of end point of the configured tunnels to the various IPv6
   networks separated by the IPv4 networks.

2.  Background

   Configured Tunnel described in this document is a simple and
   temporary mechanism which allows isolated IPv6 networks or hosts,
   attached to a legacy IPv4 network which has no native IPv6
   connectivity, to communicate with other such IPv6 networks or hosts
   with manual configuration.  The configured tunnel end-point received
   from the DHCPv6 server is not used for IPv6 connectivity as long as
   IPv6 networks or hosts are communicating with other IPv6 networks or
   hosts via IPv6 network which has native IPv6 connectivity and only
   available when communicating with other IPv6 networks or hosts via
   IPv4 networks.

   In this scenario, 6to4 [RFC3056] can be a possible alternative
   instead of configured tunnel.

   As indicated in [RFC3056], the mechanisms are intended as a start-up
   transition tool used during the period of co-existence of IPv4 and
   IPv6.  It is not intended as a permanent solution.

3.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 as defined
   in "Terminology" section of the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315].

5.  Configured Tunnel End Point Option

   The Configured Tunnel End Point Option gives the information to the
   clients about the Configured Tunnel End Point [RFC4213] to be
   contacted for reaching the nodes in the various IPv6 networks which

   are separated by IPv4 networks.  The clients are expected to install
   these routes in their machines.

   The format of the Configured Tunnel End Point Option is as shown
   below:

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |           OPTION_CTEP         |           option-len          |

     |   prefix-len  |                                               |

     |                                                               |
     |                 Configured TEP Address (16 bytes)             |
     |                                                               |
     |               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |               |... (if multiple tunnels are in use)
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+




   option-code: OPTION_CTEP (TBD)

   option-len: Total length of the prefix-len, Configured Tunnel Address
   lists in octets; It should be a multiple of 17.

   prefix-len: prefix length of this Configured TEP Address in bits.

   Configured TEP Address: IPv6 Address of the Configured TEP.

   The clients are expected to install the routes identified by the
   tuples (prefix-len, Configured TEP Address) once they receive this
   option from the server.

6.  Appearance of this option

   The Configured Tunnel End Point Option MUST NOT appear in other than
   the following messages:  Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind,
   Information-Request and Reply.

   The option numbers of Configured Tunnel End Point option MAY appear
   in the Option Request Option [RFC3315] in the following messages:
   Solicit, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-Request and Reconfigure.

7.  multiple Tunnel End Point Considerations

   For the simple tunnel discovery, one tunnel endpoint is generally
   used and it assumes that all the networks will be reached through the
   same endpoint.  In this case, one Configured TEP field in the TEP
   option is used for configured tunnel service.

   The list of endpoints can be installed if the IPv6 host load-sharing
   is honored, but there may not be a need for installing multiple
   configured tunnel endpoints unless administrator wants two for
   redundancy purposes.  It is beyond scope of this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   The Configured Tunnel End Point Option may be used by an intruder
   DHCPv6 server to provide invalid or incorrect configured tunnel end
   point.  This makes the client unable to reach its destination IPv6
   node or to reach incorrect destination.  The latter one has very
   severe security issues as IPv6 destination is spoofed here.

   To avoid attacks through this option, the DHCPv6 client SHOULD use
   authenticated DHCP (see section "Authentication of DHCP messages" in
   the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315]).

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to the following options
   from the option-code space defined in "DHCPv6 Options" section of the
   DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315].

   Option Name      Value     Described in

   OPTION_CTEP       TBD        Section 4
