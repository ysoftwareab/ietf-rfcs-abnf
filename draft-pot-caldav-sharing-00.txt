1.  Introduction

   Users of CalDAV [RFC4791] often require a mechanism to share a
   calendar with other users.

   In the past this use-case has been fulfilled by non-standard means.
   This specification aims to describe a standard way for clients and
   servers to share calendars.

   Sharing calendars is for the most part completely implemented using
   draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing, but there are a few considerations
   specific to CalDAV to ensure that mechanisms such as scheduling still
   behaves as expected.

2.  Open Issues

   1.  DAV:owner requirement for scheduling.  I think this is
       problematic...

   2.  I don't think we should allow sharees that have access to an
       invite for which they are the attendee for, via the organizers
       shared calendar, to allow them to make attendee-related changes.
       The entire collection should operate as if the operation is on
       behalf of the organizer.

3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document
   outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and
   "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names respectively.

4.  Calendar sharing

   While the draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing specification allows
   sharing of potentially any resource on a server, this specification
   only concerns itself with sharing calendar collections, as defined in
   CalDAV [RFC4791].

   Sharing of resources other than calendar collections is not addressed
   in this specification.

5.  Per-instance calendar data

   Servers that support calendar sharing MUST support "per-instance"
   calendar data in calendar object resources stored in shared
   calendars.  This allows each sharee and the sharer to store their own
   alarms and free busy transparency status without "interfering" with
   other users who also have access to the same calendar object
   resources.

   For calendaring object resources in shared calendar collections, the
   server MUST treat the following iCalendar data objects as per-
   instance:

      TRANSP property

      VALARM component

6.  Scheduling

   CalDAV Scheduling [RFC6638] defines how a CalDAV server carries out
   scheduling operations when calendar object resources are created,
   modified or deleted and include "ORGANIZER" and "ATTENDEE" iCalendar
   properties.

   When a user interacts with a shared instance of a calendar, the agent
   and server must operate as if the operation is done on behalf of the
   sharee.

   That means that if a new scheduling resource is created, the server
   MUST operate as if the calendar is a normal non-shared calendar owned
   by the sharee.  This means that when doing scheduling operations on a
   shared calendar, the agents don't act on behalf of the original
   instance.

   If a user is creating a new scheduling resource on a shared calendar,
   and an ATTENDEE listed on the scheduling resource also owns an
   instance of the shared calendar, the server MAY not create a new

   resource for the ATTENDEE.  This is to avoid events appearing
   multiple times in a user's calendars.

   A shared calendar MAY be specified in a user's CALDAV:schedule-
   default-calendar-url.

   A user that appears as an ATTENDEE in a calendar object resource in a
   shared calendar, and DAV:read-write access is granted, the sharee is
   allowed to change not only iCalendar data related to the Organizer,
   but also data related to the Attendee. i.e., a sharee can change
   their own participation status on the "ATTENDEE" iCalendar property
   referring to them.  Additionally, if the sharee is not listed as an
   Attendee, and write access is granted, the sharee can add themselves
   as an Attendee.

   Following are additional considerations for scheduling with shared
   calendars:

   1.  A scheduled iCalendar component could appear in more than one
       calendar collection within a sharee's calendar home if the sharee
       is an Attendee and the Organizer or other Attendees have shared a
       calendar with the sharee that includes their copies of the
       iCalendar component.  It is important to note that the scheduled
       component in the shared calendar could have different access
       rights than the one in the sharee's owned calendar.

   2.  A scheduled iCalendar component appearing in a sharee's shared
       calendar could include the sharee as an Attendee.  For recurring
       events, it is possible for the sharee to only be listed as an
       Attendee in some instances, as opposed to all.  Clients will need
       to be aware of this when allowing sharee's to set their own
       participation status.

   3.  In addition, when a shared calendar is first accepted by a
       sharee, the server SHOULD set the CALDAV:schedule-calendar-transp
       property to the value CALDAV:transparent to ensure newly accepted
       shared calendars do not contribute to the sharee's freebusy time
       until the sharee explicitly requests it.
