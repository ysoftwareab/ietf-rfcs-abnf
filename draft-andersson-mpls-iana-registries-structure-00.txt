           draft-andersson-mpls-iana-registries-structure-00

Abstract

   The structure of the MPLS IANA registries is not entirely intuitive.
   This document proposes a clarification.  The intention is to make a
   structure that is implicit in the MPLS IANA registries clearly
   visible.

   This document does not change any RFC, nor are the content of any
   registry touched.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a re-organization of the IANA web pages that
   hold the MPLS IANA registries [MPLS-code-points].  The intent is to
   make the structure of the MPLS IANA registries clearer, and
   registries and code points easier to find.

1.1.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology Used in this Document

   This document uses some terms that relates to IANA registries in this
   way:

      Top Level Registry
      E.g. the entry to the MPLS IANA registries [MPLS-code-points] as
      captured on the main IANA web page [IANA-prot-reg].
      Note: It might be that we want to call the IANA Protocol Registry
      "Top Level", in which case we call this level "First Level
      Registry".

Internet-Draft            MPLS IANA registries             November 2020


      IANA Name Space,
      a name space is an optional grouping immediately below top level
      registry.  An example could be "Multiprotocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters"
      [IANA-LSP-PING].  A name space is most often a container for
      registries that hold code points that share some affinity.

      IANA Registry,
      an IANA registry holds code points, and lists the registration
      procedures and allocation of code points these code points.  One
      example would be the "TLVs" registry [IANA-TLV-reg].

      IANA Sub-registry,
      a sub-registry is used when a code point allocated in a registry
      needs code points scoped by that or a set of code points.  An
      example of a sub-registry that holds code points for more than one
      TLV is "Sub-TLVs for TLV Types 1, 16, and 21" [IANA-Sub-1-16-21]

   RFC 8126 [RFC8126] discusses the terminology used to describe
   different level registries, but in Section 2.1. also say "Regardless
   of the terminology used, ... related registries (should) be grouped
   together".  This leaves us some freedom when it comes the
   terminology, however if we converge on a terminology it will be used
   for this document.

   It is not the intent of this document to change registry names and/or
   structure in such a way that that the "IANA Consideration" sections
   of any RFCs need to be updated.

2.  MPLS IANA Registry Structure

2.1.  Lack of Structure

   On the main IANA web page "Protocol Registries" [IANA-prot-reg] there
   one header for MPLS code points
   "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS)" [MPLS-arch].
   MPLS registries (name spaces and sub-registries excluded) are listed
   under this heading alphabetically.

   "Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"
   section 2.1 [RFC8126] stresses

      "... document authors should pay attention to the registry
      groupings, should request that related registries be grouped
      together to make related registries easier to find, and, when
      creating a new registry, should check whether that registry might
      best be included in an existing group."

   The listing under "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS)"
   does not seem to consider which registries and code points that
   should be grouped together.  Nor does "alphabetic order" supply
   enough of grouping.

2.2.  Implicit Structure

   However, just by scratching a little bit on what actually is there in
   the MPLS IANA registries, it becomes clear that there is an intended
   (but not immediately visible) structure.

   For example, starting on the MPLS IANA main page clicking on the
   "G-ACh Advertisement Protocol Application Registry" [G-ACh-prot-adv]
   and a page with the title
   "Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Parameters" will show up.

   This page very neatly lists all the registries that are related to
   the G-ACh.  This seems to be a good way to group registries that
   belong together on the same page.

   Like wise, starting on the MPLS IANA main page clicking on the "TLVs"
   [TLVs] and a page with the title "Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" will show up.

   This page lists all the registries that are related to LSP Ping.

   Actually there are five such pages forming a good structure for the
   MPLS IANA registries.  Those pages are:

   o  G-ACh Advertisement Protocol Application Registry
      Listing all code points that relates to the Generic Associated
      Channel.

   o  MPLS Multi-Topology Identifiers
      Listing all code points that relates to MPLS Multi-Topology.

   o  Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS) Identifier Types
      Listing all code points that relates to ITU-T Q.Recommendations.

   o  Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
      Ping Parameters
      Listing all code points that relates to the LSP Ping protocol.

   o  Special-Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Values
      Listing all code points that relates to the Special Purpose
      Labels.

2.3.  Structure made Explicit

   What is needed to meet the criteria in RFC 8126 [RFC8126] section
   2.1. "... related registries (should) be grouped together to make
   related registries easier to find", is to make the existing structure
   visible from the main IANA webpage.

   Section 3 "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS)" in this
   document outlines this explicit or "made visible" structure.
   Section 3 is "clean", i.e. there is nothing but the text that should
   show up on the main IANA web page.  All comments has been deferred to
   Section 4

4.  Comments on Section 3

   In Section 3 the section header matches the top level entry for MPLS
   code points "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS)"
   [MPLS-arch] on the main IANA web page "Protocol Registries"
   [IANA-prot-reg].

Internet-Draft            MPLS IANA registries             November 2020


   The five namespace entries (G-ACh, Architecture, LSP Ping, Multi-
   topology, and SPL are new entries to the main IANA page.  The
   registries and sub-registries should be sorted under these new
   headers as shown in Section 3.

   Registries for sub-TLVs (sub-registries) has not normally listed on
   the main IANA web page for MPLS, while we see a value of having all
   registreis listed, we believe that listing of sub-TLV registries
   should be discussed carefully before it is done.  see

   Tentatively the following structure is proposed:

   o  Top Level Registry
      I.e.  "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS)"

      *  Namespace
         E.g.  "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched
         Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters"

         +  Registry
            E.g.  "TLVs"

            -  Sub-registry
               E.g.  "Sub-TLVs for TLV Types 1, 16, and 21"

5.  Security Considerations

   This document updates IANA registries.  It also updates terminology
   used to define, and clarifies the terminology related to, the code
   points in the registries.  The document does not change how the code-
   points in the registries are used.  This should not create any new
   threats.

   However, the updated terminology and the clarifications improve
   security because it makes it more likely that implementations will be
   consistent and harder to attack.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the according to this document.

   The IANA consideration section to be detailed.

7.  Acknowledgements
