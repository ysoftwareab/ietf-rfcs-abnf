Internet-Draft              Mobile IP and EAP              February 2006


1.  Introduction

   Wireless Networks typically require that the mobile subscriber be
   authenticated before gaining access to the network.  Sometimes this
   authentication involves both user and device authentication.  The
   device authentication is required to ensure that the device the user
   is using is compatible with the network and as a side benefit is used
   to track stolen devices.

   User authentication is performed to authenticate the user to the
   subscriber account held by the home network.  This is the account
   that will be billed for the services rendered.

   EAP based authentication [RFC3579] using AAA (RADIUS [RFC2865] or
   Diameter [RFC3588]) is becoming the preferred method for handling
   device and/or user authentication.

   After access to the network is granted to the user and his device,
   the user attempts to invoke services.  Some wireless devices may
   connect to the network and are not mobile, on the other hand, some
   wireless devices connect to the network and are highly mobile.  This
   document addresses device that are mobile and tend to roam from
   network to network.  Mobile IP: MIPv4 [RFC3344] or MIPv6 [RFC3775] is
   used for these devices.

   By anchoring the IP address for the device, Mobile IP allows the
   devices to be mobile and maintain uninterrupted network access.
   Mobile IP procedures require that the device register itself with the
   Home Agent (HA).  The registration process provides a means for the
   Mobile Node to authentication with each of the Mobility Agents and in
   Mobile IPv4, for the Mobility Agents to authenticate with each other.

   The authentication requires the establishment of security association
   represented by registration keys.  The MN-HA key authenticates the
   Mobile Node with the HA, the MN-FA (Mobile IPv4) authenticates the MN
   to the FA and the FA-HA (Mobile IPv4) authenticates the FA to the HA.
   Depending on the situation some of these keys are not required and
   some are mandatory.

   There are different ways in which the mobile node and the mobility
   agents obtain the keys used during the mobile ip procedures.  The
   simplest method is that the keys are pre-provisioned in the mobile
   and at the agents.  This method is very efficient if the roaming
   domain of the mobile node is kept small.  In reality users roam
   globally and therefore pre-provisioning of mobility keys is not
   realistic.

   For MIPv4 provisioning of mobility keys is provided by [RFC3957].

   The procedures of RFC 3957 assume that the mobile node has a security
   association with a AAA server.  Using this security association,
   known as MN-AAA key, [RFC3957] prescribes how fresh mobility
   registration keys between the MN and FA and/or between the MN HA can
   be derived.  Derivation of the FA-HA key is possible by having the FA
   obtain the FA-HA key from the AAA infrastructure by having the FA
   initiate a AAA transaction when it receives a Mobile IP registration
   request from the Mobile.

   The realization of [RFC3957] and AAA is covered by [RFC4004]for
   Diameter and [I-D.nakhjiri-radius-mip4] for RADIUS.

   MIPv6 provides two mechanism for establishing a security association
   between the mobile node and the HA.  One method is to user IPSec to
   protect the Binding Update (BU) between the Mobile and the HA.  See
   [RFC3776].  The other method, protects the BU and the Binding
   Acknowledgement (BA) using the same strategy as is available for
   MIPv4.  See [RFC4285].  Both of these methods require AAA
   interactions.  For a discussion on the justification for use of
   [RFC4285] see [I-D.ietf-mip6-whyauthdataoption]

1.1.  Problem Statement

   As shown in the above, Mobile IP key derivation is highly desirable
   for wireless mobile ip.  This key derivation comes at a price of
   extra AAA interactions which has the effect of delaying the length of
   time it takes the mobile node to connect to the network.

   As well, EAP method provide a mechanism to hide the true identity of
   the mobile node, from all the nodes except the Mobile Node and the
   Home AAA.  The MIP procedures typically require the use of an NAI
   extension with no provisions for hiding the identity of the user.

   This document shows how to use the EAP based authentication used for
   Network Access to derive the Mobility Registration keys and also how
   to hide the identity of the user during Mobile IP registration.  The
   result allows the mobile to connect and to register for mobility
   service using two AAA transactions.  One transaction for the Network
   Access and one transaction between the HA and the HAAA.

1.2.  Terminology

   The document uses the RADIUS terms found in: [RFC2865], [RFC2869];
   Diameter terms found in: [RFC3588], [RFC4072], [RFC4005]; and EAP
   terms found in [RFC3579].

   The term "attributes" refers to RADIUS attributes and "Attribute
   Value Pair" or "AVP" refers to Diameter attributes.

Internet-Draft              Mobile IP and EAP              February 2006


   The term "NAS" refers to the AAA client which are assumed to be
   logically co-located with the FA.

   To ease in dealing with two AAA protocols each using similar names,
   the document adopts the following terms:
   AAA client: represents either RADIUS client or Diameter client.
   AAA server: represents either RADIUS server or Diameter server.
   AAA proxy: represents either RADIUS proxy or Diameter proxy.
   AAA-Request: represents either RADIUS Access-Request packet or
      Diameter-EAP-Request (DER).
   AAA-Accept: represents either RADIUS Access-Accept packet or
      Diameter-EAP-Answer(DEA) with Result-Code=Diameter_SUCCESS.
   AAA-Challange: represents either RADIUS Access-Challenge or a
      Diameter-EAP-Answer(DEA) with Result-
      Code=DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH.
   AAA-Reject: represents either RADIUS Access-Reject packet or
      Diameter-EAP-Answer(DEA) with Result-Code=Diameter_FAIL.
   The above terms are used to represent either Diameter or RADIUS
   operations.  Terms specific to RADIUS and Diameter will be used when
   we need to address specific RADIUS and Diameter When specific
   reference to Diameter operations.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Figure 1: Functional Entities

   The EAP method executes between the EAP PEER and the EAP
   Authentication Server in the Home Network.  The EAP method is
   transported between the AAA client in the NAS and the AAA Server in
   the Home Network.

   The Mobile Node, NAS and Home Netwrok each have a KeyHolder/
   KeyGenerators (KH/KG).  The KH/KG at the Home Network and the Mobile
   Node receive the MIP Application Key derived from the EMSK for the
   session from the EAP Peer and the EAP Server.  The KH/KG at the NAS
   receives the mobility registration keys needed by the FA which are
   derived from the MIP Application Key. These are transported over AAA
   in a secure fashion.

   The MIP Client (MIPC) at the Mobile node gets the mobility
   registration keys from the KH/KG in the mobile node.

   The FA gets the keys it needs from the KH/KG located at the NAS.

   The HA gets the mobility registration keys it needs from the KH/KG
   via AAA interaction.

   Note, the AAA does not cache any keys.  The keys are cached by the

   KH/KG as long as the session for which they were created is active.
   When the session terminates or when the session reauthenticates the
   keys are securely erased and replaced by new fresh keys.

2.2.  Network Access Authentication

   During Network Access authentication and authorization procedure the
   Mobile Node is authenticated by the HAAA using EAP based
   authentication.  The EAP method selected depends on the credentials
   that are used and must generated an MSK and EMSK.  The call flow for
   Network Access Authentication is shown in figure 2.

   Figure 2: Network Access Authentication

   If identity hiding is required then an EAP method that provides
   identity hiding is used.  In this case in order to provide for
   identity hiding during the Mobility Registration procedures, the
   Mobile node generates a temporary identity, or a pseudo identity that
   is used as the outer identity during Network Access Authentication
   and Authorization.  The outer idenity is used as the User-Name
   attribute or AVP in AAA.  The User-Name is used to route the AAA
   message to the home network.  All intermediate nodes (AAA proxies and
   brokers) will be able to see the pseudoIdentity generated by the
   Mobile Node and will not abe able to decode the inner identity.  Only
   the Home AAA will be able to decode the inner identity and thus the
   HAAA associates the pseudo identity with the true identity of the

   user.  This association will be used during mobile ip registration
   procedure.

   Before the responding with an AAA Access-Accept the EAP
   Authentication Server is requested to generate an Application Master
   Session Key (AMSK) for the mobility application.  The Mobility
   Application Master Session Key (MIP-AMSK) is generated from the EMSK
   and is sent to a Key-Holder/Key-Generator.

   When the AAA replies with the Access-Accept message contain EAP-
   Success, it requests that the Key Holder/Key Generator generate an
   MN-FA key and an FA-HA key.  These keys are then sent to the NAS in
   the Access Accept message.  The AAA must ensure that the keys are
   encrypted.  The Key Holder/Key Generator in the Home Network
   maintains these generated keys indexed by the true identity of the
   user.

   When the keys arrive at the NAS, the NAS places the keys in the Key
   Holder/Key Generator indexed by the pseudoIdentity of the user.  Thus
   the keys will be retrievable during mobile ip operations.

   A similar process occurs in the Mobile Node.  During the Network
   Access Authentication and Authorization procedure the EAP Peer
   generated the MSK and EMSK.  The EAP Peer is requested to derive the
   MIP-AMSK from the EMSK.  The MIP-AMSK is stored in the KeyHolder/
   KeyGenerator located in the Mobile Node.

   When the session terminates the Key Holder/Key Generator will
   securely erase the keys associated with the session.  Similarly when
   the session re-authenticates the old keys held by the Key Holder/Key
   Generators will be securely replaced by the new keys.

2.3.  MIPv4 Mobility Registration

   During the MIPv4 Mobility Registration procedure the Mobile Node
   generates an Mobile IP Registration Request RRQ.  See figure 3.  The
   RRQ contains the NAI extension which is set to the
   pseudo-Identity@realm generated by the mobile node during the Network
   Access Authentication Procedures.  The Mobile node requests that the
   Key Holder/Key Generator generate the MN-FA and MN-HA keys.  The
   MN-HA is used to create the MN-HA Authentication Extension (AE) and
   the MN-FA key is used to create the MN-FA AE that are included in the
   RRQ.

   When the FA receives the RRQ it asks the Key Holder/Key Generator to
   fetch the MN-FA key and the FA-HA key using the pseudo-identity
   contained the NAI extenion in the RRQ.  The FA uses the MN-FA key to
   validate the MN-FA AE and uses the FA-HA key to generate the FA-HA
   AE.

   The FA forwards the RRQ to the HA.  If the HA does not have a
   mobility association for the pseudoIdentity contained in the Mobile
   IP Registration Request, it constructs a AAA request, to fetch the
   MN-HA key and the FA-HA key.  The AAA request must contain the

   pseudoIdentity@realm as received in the Mobile IP Registration
   Request.

   The AAA server receives the request and uses the pseudoIdentity to
   lookup the true identity of the user.  If the lookup fails then this
   means that the user was never authenticated or that the user has been
   disconnected.  In this case the HAAA responds with an Access-Reject
   message.  If the lookup succeeds the AAA server asks the KeyHolder/
   KeyGenerator for the MN-HA key and FA-HA key.  The keys are sent back
   to the HA.  The HA uses these keys to validate the MN-HA AE and the
   FA-HA AE.

   If the HA receives an Access-Reject from the HAAA, it silently
   discards the RRQ.  If the HA recieves an Access-Accept from the HAAA,
   the HA uses the MN-HA and FA-HA to validate the MN-HA AE and the
   FA-HA AE.  If the extensions validate the HA responds back with an
   RRP indicating success.

   Note that during mobility procedure there are other attributes that
   are passed between the mobility agents and also between the HA and
   the HAAA.  These attributes are used for further processing or
   authorization of the mobile IP session.  The attributes are discussed
   in other RFCs.

3.  Key Hierarchy and Derivation

   As described above, the mobility keys are derived from the EAP method
   used during Network Access Authentication.  The EAP method uses a
   RootKey that is provisioned in the Mobile Node and is also known in
   the home network.  The RootKey could also be a Certificate.  The
   following diagram shows the key hierarchy.

   Figure 5: Key Hierarchy

   The keys are stored in Key Holder/Key Generation entities at the
   Mobile Node, and the Home Network and at the NAS.  The keys are
   transported to the NAS using AAA Access-Accept packet as a result of
   successful authentication and authorization.

   During mobility procedures the required keys are available at the FA
   (assuming the FA is collocated with the NAS).

   The HA uses the AAA protocol to fetch its required keys.  The
   derivation of the keys is given below:

   The MIP-AMSK is derived from the EMSK using the following formula:

   MIP-AMSK = HMAC-SHA1(EMSK,"MIP APPLICATION KEY")

   The mobility keys are derived from the MIP-AMSK using the following
   formulas:
             MN-HA = HMAC-SHA1(MIP-AMSK,"MN HA" | HA-IP)
             MN-FA = HMAC-SHA1(MIP-AMSK,"MN-FA" | FA-IP)
             FA-HA = HMAC-SHA1(MIP-AMSK,"FA-HA" | HA-IP | NONCE)

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD


5.  Conclusions

   The docuement showed how MIP Key derivation from EAP based Network
   Access Authentication can be achieved.  The advantages can be
   summarized as follows:
   o         Mobility keys are derived from fresh keys rather then a
             statically provisioned key (MN-AAA).
   o         Mobility keys are bound to an authenticated session.
   o         Mobility procedures are simplified.  No need for [RFC3957].
   o         The procedures do not require any modification to Mobile IP
             protocols.  AAA protocols may require new attributes.
   o         The reduction of AAA transaction to two transactions, one
             for Network Access Authentication and one for the HA to
             obtain the Registration Keys.

   Finally, it was shown how to provide identity hidding to Mobile IP.
