1.  Overview of VCAT and LCAS

   Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) is a standardized layer 1 inverse
   multiplexing technique that can be applied to OTN [5], SONET [2], SDH
   [1], and PDH [4] component signals.  By inverse multiplexing we mean
   a method that combines multiple links at a particular layer into an
   aggregate link to achieve a commensurate increase in available
   bandwidth on that aggregate link.  More formally, VCAT essentially
   combines the payload bandwidth of multiple path layer network signals
   (or trails) to support a single client (e.g.  Ethernet) layer link.
   Other well known standardized inverse multiplexing techniques include
   Multi Link PPP [6] and Ethernet's Link Aggregation mechanism as
   documented in chapter 43 of [7].

   One of the main differences between VCAT and the other mentioned
   inverse multiplexing standards is that VCAT works at layer 1 rather
   than at the data link layer, i.e., VCAT works with "circuits" and the
   others with layer 2 packets.  This can be important when considering
   its capabilities or limitations.

1.1  SDH/SONET VCAT signals and components

   In the following we will use SDH terminology rather than both SONET
   and SDH terminology.  In SDH Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) can be
   applied to the following component time division multiplex (TDM)
   signals referred to as Virtual Containers (VCs) (and not to be
   confused with virtual circuits):

             +---------+----------------+----------------+
             | VC type |  VC bandwidth  |   VC payload   |

             |         |                |                |
             |  VC-12  |  2 240 kbit/s  |  2 176 kbit/s  |
             |         |                |                |

   Note that when reading the VCAT and LCAS references the term "frame"
   is generally used to describe the repetitive structure of TDM signals

   and not to describe a layer 2 packet.  To simplify high speed
   aggregation of these signals, only like component signals can be
   aggregated into a VCAT group.  The aggregate signals are named and
   characterized in Table 2 extended from table 11-4 of [1].

                         Table 2: SDH VCAT Signals

   Since VCAT is an inverse multiplexing technique, SONET/SDH transport
   network nodes do not need to support these VCAT signals explicitly
   since it is the job of the VCAT end systems to reassemble the
   aggregate signal.  The only requirement on the SONET/SDH network is
   to be able to transport the individual component signals, i.e., the
   VCs of Table 1.

1.2  PDH VCAT signals and components

   VCAT can be applied to the following PDH signals as specified in
   reference [4]:

                 +--------------------+---------------+

   Similar to the SONET/SDH case these component signals can only be
   combined with like signals to produce aggregates.  For some reason
   the virtual concatenation groups of the PDH signals were not given
   unique designations in [4] so we shall adopt a similar notation to
   the SDH VCAT signals for the permitted PDH VCAT signals that follow.

1.3  OTN VCAT signals and components

   Concatenation in the optical transport network (OTN) is realized by
   means of virtual concatenation of Optical Channel Payload Unit (OPU)
   signals.  OPUk signals (k=1, 2, 3) can be concatenated into OPUk-Xv
   aggregates with X= 1,..., 256.  The aggregate signals are named and
   characterized as follows (Table 5 is taken from Table 6-3 G.8012).

             Table 5: Standardized OTN component  VCAT signals

   Note that the last row  in Table 5 is not a mis-print.  Reference [5]
   does indeed permit the virtual concatenation of up to 256, 40Gbps,
   ODU3 signals to produce an aggregate link, a ODU3-256v, with a
   capacity of over 10Tbps!  At the time of this writing the authors do
   not currently know of any actual implementations, but it should be
   noted that the standard is quite "future proof".

1.4  VCAT Capabilities and Limitations

   VCAT performs inverse multiplexing by octet/byte de-interleaving of
   the encapsulated client bit stream.  As such it operates below the
   packet/frame level.  Each frame/packet will therefore "travel" over
   all members of the VCAT group, and a fault in any of those members
   hits every Xth byte in each packet/frame.  With LCAS the failed
   member is temporarily taken out of the service providing set of the
   VCAT group, until the fault is repaired.  Due to this octet/byte de-
   interleaving VCAT introduces an insignificant processing delay into
   the transmission path.  The propagation time for the aggregate signal
   will correspond to that of the longest component signal.

   Figure 1 illustrates how incoming client traffic, in this case an
   Ethernet frame, is transported via VCAT in a transport network.  The
   incoming Ethernet frame -for the sake of simplicity only six bytes of
   the frame are depicted- is inverse-multiplexed by VCAT into three
   different VCAT members.  In Figure 1 the incoming Ethernet frame is
   spread across the three VCAT members, that is, bytes 1 and 4 are
   carried by VCAT member number 1, bytes 2 and 5 by member number 2
   while bytes 3 and 6 by member number 3.  In the case of a failure of
   VCAT member 2 bytes 2 and 5 are lost and thus it is not possible to
   rebuild the original incoming Ethernet frame.

                    Figure 1: VCAT Inverse Multiplexing

   With any inverse multiplexing technique two important issues come up:
   (a) how packet reordering is prevented, and (b) delay compensation
   limits.  For example Ethernet's link aggregation scheme prevents
   reordering by restricting "conversations" to a single link.  This
   means that the total aggregate bandwidth is not available to a single
   flow.  MLPPP and VCAT prevent reordering in a way that imposes no
   limits on the bandwidth delivered to a single flow.  Since VCAT works
   with circuits it doesn't have to deal with queueing induced
   differential delays between components.  In fact, since most circuit
   switched technologies have very low switching latency most
   differential delays experienced by VCAT component signals are due to
   propagation.  The maximum differential delays that can be
   accommodated by the standards is given in Table 6.  Actual
   implementation can choose to provide much less differential delay
   compensation and frequently do so to save on memory requirements.

                    Table 6: Differential Delay Limits

   As mentioned in [8] the ability to compensate for 256msec of
   differential delay compares favorably with the circumference of the
   earth and some rather paranoid disjoint paths.  The theoretical
   differential delay compensation limits for the OPUk, last three rows
   of Table 6, are in far excess of that needed for any terrestrial
   applications.  However it is the natural outcome of future proofing
   the VCAT mechanism for OPUk signals via the allocation of the
   equivalent of a 24 bit frame counter which can also be used by future
   higher speed signals without modification to meet the need for 256 ms
   of delay compensation.

1.5  The LCAS Protocol

   The Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme for VCAT signals is a protocol
   for dynamically and hitlessly changing (i.e., increasing and
   decreasing) the capacity of a VCAT group.  LCAS also provides
   survivability capabilities, automatically decreasing the capacity if
   a member of the VCAT group experiences a failure in the network, and
   increasing the capacity when the network fault is repaired.  LCAS,
   itself, provides a mechanism for interworking between LCAS and non-
   LCAS VCAT end points.  VCAT does not require LCAS for its operation.

   We find analogous mechanisms in other inverse multiplexing technology
   such as the Link Control Protocol (LCP) used in MLPPP [6] and the
   Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) used in Ethernet Link
   Aggregation [7].  It needs to be emphasized that none of these

   mechanisms are responsible for establishing the component links.
   Indeed, these protocols run over the component links themselves.
   Hence LCAS functionality does not overlap or conflict with GMPLS'
   routing or signaling functionality for the establishment of component
   links or entire VCAT groups.  LCAS instead is used to control whether
   a particular component signal is actually put into service carrying
   traffic for the VCAT group.

   Although we are used to PDH and SONET/SDH signals being bi-
   directional, LCAS actually works on unidirectional components in a
   VCAT group with the proviso that there is at least one return
   component for conveyance of LCAS messages.  As viewed from LCAS'
   point of view the source end of each component can have the following
   states:

   LCAS provides for graceful degradation of failed links by having the
   sink end report back the receive status of all member components.  In
   the case of a reported member failure, the source end will stop using
   the component and the source end will send an LCAS message to the
   sink end that it is not transmitting data on that component.  The

2.  VCAT/LCAS Scenarios

   In this section we list a number of VCAT/LCAS usage scenarios.  We
   will evaluate the applicability of GMPLS to these scenarios in
   Section 3 and for those scenarios that GMPLS does not currently
   support we describe possible GMPLS extensions  in Section 4.  These
   scenarios can easily form the basis for formal requirements, however
   at this point in time we list the scenarios and can later evaluate
   which of these must be supported.  Note the term "component" signal
   in the text is used as a simplified notion to the more formal
   concepts of VC-n, ODUk, and PDH termination function as well as VC-n,
   ODUk and PDH path/trail.

2.1  Discovery of Enabled End Systems

   Discovering VCAT: VCAT sources can only communicate with VCAT capable
      sinks.  Hence the VCAT capabilities of a PDH, SDH, or OTN path
      termination points need to be known.

   Discovering LCAS: LCAS offers additional functionality between VCAT
      capable sources and sinks.  Hence the LCAS capabilities of VCAT
      enabled path termination points can be useful to know in advance
      of component signal setup.


2.2  Client to End Point Mappings

   Fixed Client to End point Mapping: Per client signal there is a
      VC-n-Xv circuit in which the X VC-n termination points are
      dedicated to this client signal.  At any point in time, Y out of X
      VC-n termination points may be set up to carry client traffic.
      For example when VCAT is deployed on a Router, the VCAT group
      connects directly to one STM-N interface port (in absence of a HO
      or LO switch fabric in the router).  The transport network will
      then split the VCAT group into two or more subgroups of
      components, each being routed via diverse routes.

   Variable Client to End point Mapping: For a set of M client signals
      there are M VC-n-Xv VCAT endpoints sharing a set of N (N>M) VC-n
      termination points.  Typically MxX > N (example: M=10, X=7, N=64);
      i.e. there is a kind of overbooking.  Implication: must be able to
      accommodate multiple different sized VCAT groups at an
      "interface".  For example an STM-64 interface can support many
      different VC-4-Xv groups.

2.3  VCAT configuration without LCAS

   1.  Sink end needs to be informed of how many components are in the
       VCAT group.  It has no other way of knowing if it is currently
       receiving all components intended to be in the group.

   2.  Additions or removals of components from the VCAT group are not
       hitless, that is data loss will occur while the source and sink
       become synchronized as to the number of members in the group.
       With each addition or removal the sink end point needs to be told
       the expected number of components in the group.

   3.  Failure of a component is detected external to VCAT system.
       Entire group is rendered inoperable until source takes the failed
       component out of service and sink end is notified to take
       component out of service.


2.4  VCAT configuration with LCAS

   1.  Sink end (and source end) are first  configured with the value of
       "Y" (the number of components), and more specifically which of
       the X (e.g.  VC-n) access points (and thus (VC-n) termination
       functions) are allocated to the VCAT group with Y (VC-n)
       components.  LCAS then detects automatically which of those Y
       (VC-n) components is carrying actual traffic and puts them into
       service for the group.

   2.  When a new component signal has to be added to a VCAT group the
       following procedure applies.

       1.  Configure the adaptation source/sink functions and change the
           number of components, Y, to Y+1 by identifying which of the
           X-Y (e.g.  VC-n) access points currently outside the group is
           added to the group;

       2.  The new component is created, e.g., the cross-connections are
           establish along the components path.

       3.  As soon as LCAS protocol information exchange is finished,
           i.e., the state NORM is reached, client traffic is sent on
           the added component.

       This procedure does not affect the already established LCAS
       members, that is, client traffic is not sent on the new component
       until the LCAS procedure is complete;

Internet-Draft            GMPLS, VCAT and LCAS                 July 2005


   3.  When a component is removed the following procedure applies:

       1.  LCAS protocol is used to remove the component from the group,
           that is, incoming traffic client data is transmitted on the
           other VCAT component(s) to assure that the procedure is not
           traffic affecting

       2.  Configure the adaptation source/sink functions and change the
           number of components Y to Y-1; i.e. remove the VC-n access
           point from the group.

       3.  The component connection can be, if needed, removed from the
           transport network.

   4.  When a component fails, the LCAS sink detects the failure (how
       this is done is outside the scope of this ID) and informs the
       source of this failure via the member status (MST) information.
       The source then:

       1.  Takes the failed component out of service and if necessary
           rearranges the sequencing of the VCAT group.

       2.  Informs the sink about the component removed from service and
           any re-arranging of the VCAT group.

       When the failed component is repaired, LCAS can automatically add
       the repaired component back to the group, or alternatively a new
       component can be added to bring the group back to its original
       size.  Note that component failure is not hitless, but note the
       fast notification times of Table 8


2.5  Component Signal Configuration Scenarios

   Here we use the term "group" to refer to the entire VCAT group and
   the terminology "set" and "subset" to refer to the collection of
   potential VCAT group member signals.

   1.  A fixed bandwidth VCAT group, transported over a co-routed set of
       member signals.  This is the case where the intended bandwidth of
       the VCAT group does not change and all member signals follow a
       similar route.  The intent here is the capability to allocate the
       "right" amount of bandwidth.

   2.  A fixed bandwidth VCAT group, transported over at least two
       disjointly routed subsets of member signals.  The intent here is
       additional resilience and graceful degradation in the case of
       failure.  Implications: either LCAS needs to be supported by both



Bernstein, et al.        Expires January 9, 2006               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft            GMPLS, VCAT and LCAS                 July 2005


       source and sink or we need two-way communications of some type
       between source and sink to coordinate which members are to be
       used in the group in a failure scenario.  Protection or
       restoration may be applied in order to restore the original group
       size in case of failure of either one of the subsets.

   3.  A dynamic VCAT group (bandwidth can be increased or decreased via
       the addition or removal of member signals), transported over a
       co-routed set of members.  Intent here is dynamic sizing of
       bandwidth.  Implications: LCAS is needed for hitless resizing.
       Note before LCAS can do its part of getting traffic over the
       modified VCAT group, the two VCAT/LCAS endpoints need to be
       configured (Y -> Y+1 or Y -> Y-1); this requires either
       "communication" between the two endpoints (when one of the
       endpoints is configured by call/connection controller, or simple
       communication of the call/connection controller with both
       endpoints.  Without LCAS we still need two way communications
       between source and sink to coordinate which members are used in
       the group and changes will not be hitless.  Of course, if all the
       members of the group are co-routed a single failure may destroy
       the entire group and cause interruption of traffic even if LCAS
       is enabled.

   4.  A dynamic VCAT group, transported over at least two disjointly
       routed subsets of member signals.  Intent here is dynamic
       resizing and resilience.  Implications similar to cases 2 and 3
       above.

   5.  Two or more VCAT groups between the same source and sink who
       desire to share a pool of component signals between them.  Each
       VCAT group may have a dedicated set of members, and may also
       obtain additional members from a "common pool" of components.
       Note that at any given point in time a component signal can
       belong to at most one VCAT group.  The intent here is to allow
       dynamic resizing of VCAT groups via the sharing of a pool of
       established component signals without requiring complete circuit
       provisioning, i.e., only the group membership of the component
       signal would change.  Implications: a communications mechanism
       between source and sink to indicate during a "change" which group
       a component should now belong.  Similar dynamics and resilience
       implications as cases 2 and 3 above.  (This is Adrian's
       scenario).

3.  Current Support for VCAT group provisioning with GMPLS

   Here we see how well we can satisfy the scenarios of Section 2.

3.1  Discovery of VCAT/LCAS

   Currently no support for discovery of VCAT or LCAS apriori, i.e., via
   routing information.  Support for "discovery" of VCAT capability at
   connection establishment time via signaling, i.e., we can request
   VCAT connection and if the end system cannot support it,it would
   refuse the connection.  TBD -- is there a specific error code
   concerning "VCAT not supported".

   Currently there is no mechanism to ask for an LCAS enabled end point
   nor is there a way to find out if the other end is LCAS enabled until
   after the connection is established.  This is a problem if we
   specifically want hitless dynamic resizing or fast graceful
   degradation for a VCAT group.

3.2  Support for Multiple Client to End Point Mappings

   This is where we can have more than one VCAT group on an "interface"
   (port, etc...) and we need to tell them apart.  Currently there is no
   "VCAT group identifier" in GMPLS.

3.3  Support for VCAT configuration without LCAS

   Fixed sized co-routed groups are supported with current GMPLS
   signaling.  For disjointly routed components we would need a small
   amount of signaling between the VCAT source and sink to make up for
   the lack of LCAS.  In particular, each side (source and sink) needs
   to know and be in agreement on the components in the group.  It is
   TBD whether GMPLS's existing Admin-Status object can provide
   sufficient information to achieve this purpose.  Note that we cannot
   achieve hitless resizing this way but we can be fairly prompt and
   keep the management systems from having to do this.  Main items that
   we need to know are: (a) which component has failed (sink to source),
   (b) the which components  should be in the group (source to sink).

3.4  Support for VCAT configuration with LCAS

   Currently both co-routed and disjointly routed connections can be
   supported.  Detailed analysis TBD.  For hitless resizing some
   reasonable default behaviors for controlling LCAS should be followed:
   (a) After GMPLS has successfully established a potential new
   component, LCAS should be told (local to source end) to add it to the
   group, (b) Before GMPLS tears down a component, LCAS should be told
   (local to source end) to remove it from the group.

3.5  Component Signal Configuration Support

   Rough analysis of the list of Section 2.5.

   1.  Fixed bandwidth, Co-routed: Yes, already in the signaling RFC.

   2.  Fixed bandwidth, Diversely routed component subsets: TBD if
       admin-status object will suffice in the non-LCAS case.

   3.  Dynamic Bandwidth, Co-routed: TBD if admin-status object will
       suffice in the non-LCAS case.

   4.  Dynamic Bandwidth, Diversely routed: Similar requirements as
       above.

   5.  Adrian's scenario: Currently not supported.  Need to be able to
       signal that we want a potential component to be used in a new
       VCAT group.  Note that the source end would first remove it from
       its old group.  However we need to tell the VCAT group to add it
       to.  The sink end really can't tell this itself.  The LCAS group
       id is just a 1 bit psuedo-random sequence that is used to avoid
       adding the wrong component to a group.

4.  Possible Extensions to GMPLS to support additional VCAT/LCAS
    scenarios

   Here we look at what might be reasonable to add to GMPLS to support
   the interest scenarios of Section 2 that were not covered under
   Section 3 .

4.1  Mechanisms for Discovery of VCAT/LCAS

   Would like to get both VCAT and LCAS capability of end systems via
   routing...

   Would like to be able to specifically ask for LCAS capability via
   signaling...

4.2  Mechanism to Support Multiple Client to End Point Mappings

   This is a very important capability and it is very similar to one
   that is being proposed in the end-to-end signaling for recovery I-D.
   In particular the ASSOCIATION object.  Note, however, since there is
   a rather high probability that at some point we might use VCAT/LCAS
   with GMPLS based protection we would really need an ASSOCIATION
   object type specific to VCAT.  Association objects are not unique and
   therefore adding a new type to the Association object would make it a
   good candidate to support this requirement.

4.3  Support for Component Signal Configuration Scenarios

   TBD based on analysis of use of admin-status object.  If the admin-
   status object is sufficient we will detail its use in this
   application since it is currently an optional object.
