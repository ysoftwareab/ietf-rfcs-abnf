Abstract  
    
   This document describes different scenarios in Third Generation 
   Partnership Project (3GPP) defined packet network, i.e. General 
   Packet Radio Service (GPRS) that would need IP version 6 and IP 
   version 4 transition. The focus of this document is on the scenarios 
   where the User Equipment (UE) connects to nodes in other networks, 
   e.g. in the Internet. GPRS network internal transition scenarios, 
   i.e. between different GPRS elements in the network, are out of scope 
   of this document.   
        
   The purpose of the document is to list the scenarios for further 
   discussion and study.

1. Introduction  
        
   This document will describe the transition scenarios in 3GPP packet 
   data networks that might come up in the deployment phase of IPv6.  
   The main purpose of this document is to identify, and document those 
   scenarios for further discussion, and for study in the NGTRANS 
   working group.   
        
   This document does give neither an overview, nor an explanation of 
   3GPP or the 3GPP packet data network - the GPRS. A good overview of 
   the 3GPP specified GPRS can be found from [1]. The GPRS architecture 
   specification is defined in [2].   
        
2. Scope of the document 
        
   The scope of this document is to describe the possible transition 
   scenarios in the 3GPP defined GPRS network where a UE connects to, or 
   is contacted from the Internet, or another UE. The document describes 
   scenarios with and without the usage of the SIP based IP Multimedia 
   Core Network Subsystem (IMS).   
        
   The scope of this document does not include scenarios inside the GPRS 
   network, i.e. on the different interfaces of the GPRS network. In 
   addition, this document does not identify solutions - just possible 
   scenarios.  
    
   These scenarios may, or may not be found feasible, or even likely in 
   further study.   
        
3. Transition scenarios 
        
   This section is divided into two main parts - GPRS scenarios, and 
   scenarios with the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). The first part - 
   GPRS scenarios - concentrate on scenarios with a User Equipment (UE) 
   connecting to services in the Internet, e.g. mail, web. The second 
   part - IMS scenarios - then describes how an IMS capable UE can 
   connect to other SIP capable nodes in the Internet using the IMS 
   services.

3.1 GPRS Scenarios 
        
   This section describes the scenarios that might occur when a GPRS UE 
   contacts services, or nodes outside the GPRS network, e.g. web-server 
   in the Internet.   
        
   Transition scenarios of the GPRS internal interfaces are outside of 
   the scope of this document.   
        
   The following scenarios are described here. In all of the scenarios, 
   the UE is part of a network where there is at least one router of the 
   same IP version, i.e. GGSN, and it is connecting to a node in a 
   different network. 
        
      1) Dual Stack UE connecting to IPv4 and IPv6 nodes 
      2) IPv6 UE connecting to an IPv6 node through an IPv4 network 
      3) IPv4 UE connecting to an IPv4 node through an IPv6 network 
      4) IPv6 UE connecting to an IPv4 node 
      5) IPv4 UE connecting to an IPv6 node 
        
        
   1) Dual Stack UE connecting to IPv4 and IPv6 nodes   
        
   The GPRS system has been designed in a manner that there is the 
   possibility to have simultaneous IPv4, and IPv6 PDP Contexts open. 
   Thus, in cases where the UE is dual stack capable, and in the network 
   there is a GGSN (or separate GGSNs) that supports both connection to 
   IPv4, and IPv6 networks, it is possible to connect to both at the 
   same time.  
        
   However, the IPv4 addresses might be a scarce resource for the mobile 
   operator or an ISP. In that case, it might not be possible for the UE 
   to have a globally unique IPv4 address allocated all the time. Hence, 
   either activating the IPv4 PDP Context only when needed, or having an 
   IPv4 address from a private address space.   
        
        
   2) IPv6 UE connecting to an IPv6 node through an IPv4 network   
        
   Especially in the first stages of IPv6 deployment, there are cases 
   where an IPv6 node would need to connect to the IPv6 Internet through 
   a network that is IPv4. For instance this can be seen in current 
   fixed networks, where the access is provided in IPv4 only, but there 
   is an IPv6 network deeper in the Internet.   
        
   In this case, in the GPRS system, the UE would be IPv6 capable, and 
   the GPRS network would be IPv6 capable of providing an IPv6 capable

   GGSN in the network. However, the operator only has an IPv4 network 
   as such.   
        
        
   3) IPv4 UE connecting to an IPv4 node through an IPv6 network   
        
   Further in the future, there are cases where the legacy UEs are still 
   IPv4 only, capable of connecting to the legacy IPv4 Internet. 
   However, the GPRS operator network has already been upgraded to IPv6.  
        
   In this case, the operator would still provide the IPv4 capable GGSN, 
   and a connection through the IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet. 
        
        
   4) IPv6 UE connecting to an IPv4 node   
        
   In this scenario an IPv6 UE connects to an IPv4 node in the IPv4 
   Internet. As an example, an IPv6 UE connects to an IPv4 web server in 
   the legacy Internet.  
        
        
   5) IPv4 UE connecting to an IPv6 node   
        
   This is similar to the case above, but to the opposite direction. 
   Here an IPv4 UE connects to an IPv6 node in the IPv6 Internet. As an 
   example, a legacy IPv4 UE is connected to an IPv6 server in the IPv6 
   Internet. 
        
        
3.2 Transition scenarios with IMS 
        
   IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS) is a SIP based multimedia 
   service architecture. It is specified in the Release 5 of 3GPP. It 
   comprises a set of SIP proxies, servers, and registrars. In addition, 
   there are Media Gateways (MGWs) that offer connections to non-IP 
   networks such as the Public Switched Telephony Network (PSTN).   
        
   IMS is exclusively IPv6. Hence, all the traffic for the IMS is IPv6, 
   even if the UE would be dual stack capable. More information on IMS 
   can be found in [3].   
        
   As IMS is exclusively IPv6, the number of possible transition 
   scenarios is reduced dramatically. In the following, the possible 
   transition scenarios are listed.   
        
      1) UE connecting to a node in an IPv4 network through IMS 
      2) Two IPv6 IMS connected via an IPv4

   1) UE connecting to a node in an IPv4 network through IMS 
        
   This scenario occurs when an IMS UE (IPv6) connects to a node in the 
   IPv4 Internet through the IMS, or vice versa. This happens when the 
   other node is a part of a different system than 3GPP, e.g. a fixed 
   PC, with only IPv4 capabilities.   
        
        
   2) Two IPv6 IMS connected via an IPv4 
        
   At the early stages of IMS deployment, there may be cases where two 
   IMS islands are separated on IPv4 network such as the legacy 
   Internet. Here both the UEs are IPv6 and the IMSes where the UEs are 
   IPv6. However, the IPv6 islands are not native IPv6 connected.   
        
        
4. Security Considerations  
     
   This document does not generate any additional security 
   considerations.
