  Abstract 
      
     This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use 
     with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it 
     defines objects for use by the MEGACO/H.248 protocol operating on Media 
     Gateways and Media Gateway Controllers. These objects can be used to manage the 
     network containing Media Gateways and Media Gateway Controllers. 
      
     Changes from the previous version of the draft include: 
      
     1. Added medGwyGatewayControllerId as an additional index to the 
          medGwyGatewayControllerTable.

     2. Modified the usage of TimeTicks to TimeStamp which is now being widely used 
          and is more useful. 
     3. Converted the Integer32∆s to Unsigned32 wherever appropriate. 
     4. Added few more Textual Conventions that could be imported to vendor specific 
          MIBs. 
     5. Corrected few MIB syntax errors. 
     6. Reformatted the entire document to be compliant with the new IETF MIB 
          guidelines from [MIBGUIDE]

  1.     The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
   
     For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet-
     Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
      
     Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the 
     Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally accessed through 
     the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined 
     using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  
     This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is 
     described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, 
     RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
   
   
  2.     Overview 
      
     The MEGACO/H.248 protocol [RFC3015] [ITUH248] defines communication between the 
     elements of a physically decomposed multimedia gateway. Those elements are the 
     Media Gateway Controller (MGC) and the Media Gateway (MG). This MIB defines 
     objects on these elements that are to be used to configure these elements such 
     as through control of variable settings, to gather and report management 
     statistics, and to report the occurrence of system management events (i.e., 
     traps) to the network management system.

     This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB 
     conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.  
     The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where 
     objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of 
     Counter64).  Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into 
     textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this 
     loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics 
     of the MIB. 
      
  2.1      Terms 
   
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
     "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
     interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

     --

     --       (on a media gateway), and Configuration Information for these  
     --       Controllers. 
     -- 
     --   (2) An Entry in this Table is automatically created when a manager 
     --       creates an entry in the medGwyGatewayConfigTable because even  
     --       though the same MGC could manage many gateways, they could have 
     --       different logical IP address/Port number towards each of the  
     --       gateway 
     -- 
     --   (3) There can be many logical gateways inside a physical gateway  
     --       (MediaGatewayId) and there can me multiple media gateway  
     --       controllers (medGwyGatewayControllerId) and there can be many  
     --       links between "m" number of gateways and "n" number of controllers 
     --       (medGwyGatewayLinkId).

     -- 
     --   (1) There are 'N' entries for each Gateway-PropertyProfile 
     --   (2) Each entry is a supported property, thus this table gives a list 
     --       of supported properties for each specified Profile. 
     --   (3) Each Property is defined as an Object Identifer in the various 
     --       Package Mibs (like MEGACO-TONES-MIB etc).   
     --   (4) That OID is used to identify the particular Package, and if the  
     --       Termination supports the property, this Package OID is included  
     --       in its list. 
     --   (5) Terminations (in the TerminationsTable) will have a 
     --       PropertyProfileId that indicates which PropertyProfile this 
     --       Termination supports.  
     --   (6) A Manager builds a Profile of properties, then ties each  
     --       termination to a defined profile, via the PropertyProfileId 
     --   (7) Vendors are encouraged to come up with different profiles 
     --       for different scenarios in order to ensure inter-operability

  7.     Security Considerations 
      
     In order to implement this MIB, a probe must capture all packets on the 
     locally-attached network, including packets between third parties.  These 
     packets are analyzed to collect network addresses, protocol usage information, 
     and conversation statistics. Data of this nature may be considered sensitive in 
     some environments. In such environments the administrator may wish to restrict 
     SNMP access to the probe. 
      
     This MIB also includes functions for returning the contents of captured 
     packets, potentially including sensitive user data or passwords. It is 
     recommended that SNMP access to these functions be restricted. 
      
     There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
     ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be considered 
     sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support for SET 
     operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
     negative effect on network operations. 
      
     SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network itself is 
     secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is  no control as to who 
     on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
     (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
      
     It is recommended that the implementors consider the security features as 
     provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the  use of the User-based

     Security Model RFC 2574 [18] and the View- based Access Control Model RFC 2575 
     [17] is recommended. 
      
     It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving 
     access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give access to the 
     objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed 
     GET or SET change/create/delete) them.
