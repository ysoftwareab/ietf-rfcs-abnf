                 draft-ietf-oauth-jwk-thumbprint-uri-00

Abstract

   This specification registers a kind of URI that represents a JSON Web
   Key (JWK) Thumbprint value.  JWK Thumbprints are defined in RFC 7638.
   This enables JWK Thumbprints to be used, for instance, as key
   identifiers in contexts requiring URIs.

1.  Introduction

   A JSON Web Key (JWK) Thumbprint [RFC7638] is a URL-safe
   representation of a hash value over a JSON Web Key (JWK) [RFC7517].
   This specification defines a URI prefix indicating that the portion
   of the URI following the prefix is a JWK Thumbprint.  This enables
   JWK Thumbprints to be communicated in contexts requiring URIs,
   including in specific JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] claims.

   JWK Thumbprints URIs are being used in the [SIOPv2] specification as
   one kind of subject identifier in a context requiring that the
   identifier be a URI.  In this case, the subject identifier is derived
   from a public key represented as a JWK.  Expressing the identifier as
   JWK Thumbprint URI enables this kind of identifier to be
   differentiated from other kinds of identifiers that are also URIs,
   such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) [DID-Core].

2.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  JWK Thumbprint URI

   The following URI prefix is defined to indicate that the portion of
   the URI following the prefix is a JWK Thumbprint:

   o  "urn:ietf:params:oauth:jwk-thumbprint"

Internet-Draft             JWK Thumbprint URI               January 2022


   The prefix is followed by a colon and a JWK Thumbprint value to form
   a URI representing a JWK Thumbprint.

3.1.  Example JWK Thumbprint URI

   Section 3.1 of [RFC7638] contains the following example JWK
   Thumbprint value:

     NzbLsXh8uDCcd-6MNwXF4W_7noWXFZAfHkxZsRGC9Xs

   A complete JWK Thumbprint URI using the above JWK Thumbprint is:

  urn:ietf:params:oauth:jwk-thumbprint:NzbLsXh8uDCcd-6MNwXF4W_7noWXFZAfHkxZsRGC9Xs

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC7638] also apply when using this
   specification.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  OAuth URI Registration

   This specification registers the following value in the IANA "OAuth
   URI" registry [IANA.OAuth.Parameters] established by [RFC6755].

5.1.1.  Registry Contents

   o  URN: urn:ietf:params:oauth:jwk-thumbprint
   o  Common Name: JWK Thumbprint URI
   o  Change controller: IESG
   o  Specification Document: [[ this specification ]]
