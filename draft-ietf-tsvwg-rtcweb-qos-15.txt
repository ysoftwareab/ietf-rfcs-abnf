             DSCP and other packet markings for WebRTC QoS
                     draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos-15

Abstract

   Many networks, such as service provider and enterprise networks, can
   provide different forwarding treatments for individual packets based
   on Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) values on a per-hop
   basis.  This document provides the recommended DSCP values for web
   browsers to use for various classes of WebRTC traffic.

1.  Introduction

   Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) [RFC2474] packet marking
   can help provide QoS in some environments.  This specification
   provides default packet marking for browsers that support WebRTC
   applications, but does not change any advice or requirements in other
   IETF RFCs.  The contents of this specification are intended to be a
   simple set of implementation recommendations based on the previous
   RFCs.

   There are many use cases where such marking does not help, but it
   seldom makes things worse if packets are marked appropriately.  There
   are some environments where DSCP markings frequently help, though.
   These include:

   1.  Private, wide-area networks.  Network administrators have control
       over remarking packets and treatment of packets.

   2.  Residential Networks.  If the congested link is the broadband
       uplink in a cable or DSL scenario, often residential routers/NAT
       support preferential treatment based on DSCP.

   3.  Wireless Networks.  If the congested link is a local wireless
       network, marking may help.

Internet-Draft                 WebRTC QoS                     March 2016


   DSCP values are in principle site specific, with each site selecting
   its own code points for controlling per-hop-behavior to influence the
   QoS for transport-layer flows.  However in the WebRTC use cases, the
   browsers need to set them to something when there is no site specific
   information.  In this document, "browsers" is used synonymously with
   "Interactive User Agent" as defined in the HTML specification,
   [W3C.REC-html5-20141028].  This document describes a subset of DSCP
   code point values drawn from existing RFCs and common usage for use
   with WebRTC applications.  These code points are solely defaults.

   This specification defines inputs that are provided by the WebRTC
   application hosted in the browser that aid the browser in determining
   how to set the various packet markings.  The specification also
   defines the mapping from abstract QoS policies (flow type, priority
   level) to those packet markings.

2.  Relation to Other Specifications

   This document is a complement to [RFC7657], which describes the
   interaction between DSCP and real-time communications.  That RFC
   covers the implications of using various DSCP values, particularly
   focusing on Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] streams that
   are multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow.

   There are a number of guidelines specified in [RFC7657] that apply to
   marking traffic sent by WebRTC applications, as it is common for
   multiple RTP streams to be multiplexed on the same transport-layer
   flow.  Generally, the RTP streams would be marked with a value as
   appropriate from Table 1.  A WebRTC application might also multiplex
   data channel [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] traffic over the same
   5-tuple as RTP streams, which would also be marked as per that table.
   The guidance in [RFC7657] says that all data channel traffic would be
   marked with a single value that is typically different than the
   value(s) used for RTP streams multiplexed with the data channel
   traffic over the same 5-tuple, assuming RTP streams are marked with a
   value other than default forwarding (DF).  This is expanded upon
   further in the next section.

   This specification does not change or override the advice in any
   other IETF RFCs about setting packet markings.  Rather, it simply
   selects a subset of DSCP values that is relevant in the WebRTC
   context.

   The DSCP value set by the endpoint is not trusted by the network.  In
   addition, the DSCP value may be remarked at any place in the network
   for a variety of reasons to any other DSCP value, including default
   forwarding (DF) value to provide basic best effort service.  Even so,
   there is benefit in marking traffic even if it only benefits the

   first few hops.  The implications are discussed in Secton 3.2 of
   [RFC7657].  Further, a mitigation for such action is through an
   authorization mechanism.  Such an authorization mechanism is outside
   the scope of this document.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Inputs

   WebRTC applications send and receive two types of flows of
   significance to this document:

   o  media flows which are RTP streams [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage]

   o  data flows which are data channels [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel]

   Each of the RTP streams and distinct data channels consists of all of
   the packets associated with an independent media entity, so an RTP
   stream or distinct data channel is not always equivalent to a
   transport-layer flow defined by a 5-tuple (source address,
   destination address, source port, destination port, and protocol).
   There may be multiple RTP streams and data channels multiplexed over
   the same 5-tuple, with each having a different level of importance to
   the application and, therefore, potentially marked using different
   DSCP values than another RTP stream or data channel within the same
   transport-layer flow.  (Note that there are restrictions with respect
   to marking different data channels carried within the same SCTP
   association as outlined in Section 5.)

   The following are the inputs provided by the WebRTC application to
   the browser:

   o  Flow Type: The browser provides this input as it knows if the flow
      is audio, interactive video with or without audio, non-interactive
      video with or without audio, or data.

   o  Application Priority: Another input is the relative importance of
      an RTP stream or data channel.  Many applications have multiple
      flows of the same Flow Type and often some flows are more
      important than others.  For example, in a video conference where
      there are usually audio and video flows, the audio flow may be
      more important than the video flow.  JavaScript applications can
      tell the browser whether a particular flow is high, medium, low or
      very low importance to the application.

   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-transports] defines in more detail what an
   individual flow is within the WebRTC context and priorities for media
   and data flows.

5.  DSCP Mappings

   The DSCP values for each flow type of interest to WebRTC based on
   application priority are shown in the following table.  These values
   are based on the framework and recommended values in [RFC4594].  A
   web browser SHOULD use these values to mark the appropriate media
   packets.  More information on EF can be found in [RFC3246].  More
   information on AF can be found in [RFC2597].  DF is default
   forwarding which provides the basic best effort service [RFC2474].

   |       Flow Type        |  Very | Low  |    Medium   |     High    |
   |                        |  Low  |      |             |             |

   +------------------------+-------+------+-------------+-------------+

         Table 1: Recommended DSCP Values for WebRTC Applications

   The application priority, indicated by the columns "very low", "low",
   "Medium", and "high", signifies the relative importance of the flow
   within the application.  It is an input that the browser receives to
   assist in selecting the DSCP value and adjusting the network
   transport behavior.

   The above table assumes that packets marked with CS1 are treated as
   "less than best effort", such as the LE behavior described in
   [RFC3662].  However, the treatment of CS1 is implementation
   dependent.  If an implementation treats CS1 as other than "less than
   best effort", then the actual priority (or, more precisely, the per-
   hop-behavior) of the packets may be changed from what is intended.
   It is common for CS1 to be treated the same as DF, so applications
   and browsers using CS1 cannot assume that CS1 will be treated
   differently than DF [RFC7657].  However, it is also possible per



Jones, et al.          Expires September 19, 2016               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 WebRTC QoS                     March 2016


   [RFC2474] for CS1 traffic to be given better treatment than DF, thus
   caution should be exercised when electing to use CS1.  This is one of
   the cases where marking packets using these recommendations can make
   things worse.

   Implementers should also note that excess EF traffic is dropped.
   This could mean that a packet marked as EF may not get through,
   although the same packet marked with a different DSCP value would
   have gotten through.  This is not a flaw, but how excess EF traffic
   is intended to be treated.

   The browser SHOULD first select the flow type of the flow.  Within
   the flow type, the relative importance of the flow SHOULD be used to
   select the appropriate DSCP value.

   The combination of flow type and application priority provides
   specificity and helps in selecting the right DSCP value for the flow.
   All packets within a flow SHOULD have the same application priority.
   In some cases, the selected application priority cell may have
   multiple DSCP values, such as AF41 and AF42.  These offer different
   drop precedences.  The different drop precedence values provides
   additional granularity in classifying packets within a flow.  For
   example, in a video conference, the video flow may have medium
   application priority.  If so, either AF42 or AF43 may be selected.
   If the I-frames in the stream are more important than the P-frames,
   then the I-frames can be marked with AF42 and the P-frames marked
   with AF43.  (See Section 3 of [RFC6386] for a description of video
   frame types.)

   It is worth noting that the application priority is utilized by the
   coupled congestion control mechanism for media flows per
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-coupled-cc] and the SCTP scheduler for data channel
   traffic per [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

   For reasons discussed in Section 6 of [RFC7657], if multiple flows
   are multiplexed using a reliable transport (e.g., TCP) then all of
   the packets for all flows multiplexed over that transport-layer flow
   MUST be marked using the same DSCP value.  Likewise, all WebRTC data
   channel packets transmitted over an SCTP association MUST be marked
   using the same DSCP value, regardless of how many data channels
   (streams) exist or what kind of traffic is carried over the various
   SCTP streams.  In the event that the browser wishes to change the
   DSCP value in use for an SCTP association, it MUST reset the SCTP
   congestion controller after changing values.  Frequent changes in the
   DSCP value used for an SCTP association are discouraged, though, as
   this would defeat any attempts at effectively managing congestion.
   It should also be noted that any change in DSCP value that results in
   a reset of the congestion controller puts the SCTP association back



Jones, et al.          Expires September 19, 2016               [Page 6]

   into slow start, which may have undesirable effects on application
   performance.

   For the data channel traffic multiplexed over an SCTP association, it
   is RECOMMENDED that the DSCP value selected be the one associated
   with the highest priority requested for all data channels multiplexed
   over the SCTP association.  Likewise, when multiplexing multiple
   flows over a TCP connection, the DCSP value selected should be the
   one associated with the highest priority requested for all
   multiplexed flows.

   If a packet enters a network that has no support for a flow type-
   application priority combination specified in Table 1 (above), then
   the network node at the edge will remark the DSCP value based on
   policies.  This could result in the flow not getting the network
   treatment it expects based on the original DSCP value in the packet.
   Subsequently, if the packet enters a network that supports a larger
   number of these combinations, there may not be sufficient information
   in the packet to restore the original markings.  Mechanisms for
   restoring such original DSCP is outside the scope of this document.

   In summary, DSCP marking provides neither guarantees nor promised
   levels of service.  However, DSCP marking is expected to provide a
   statistical improvement in real-time service as a whole.  The service
   provided to a packet is dependent upon the network design along the
   path, as well as the network conditions at every hop.

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not add any additional security implications
   beyond those addressed in the following DSCP-related specifications.
   For security implications on use of DSCP, please refer to Section 7
   of [RFC7657] and Section 6 of [RFC4594].  Please also see
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security] as an additional reference.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not require any actions from IANA.

8.  Downward References

   This specification contains a downwards reference to [RFC4594] and
   [RFC7657].  However, the parts of the former RFC used by this
   specification are sufficiently stable for this downward reference.
   The guidance in the latter RFC is necessary to understand the
   Diffserv technology used in this document and the motivation for the
   recommended DSCP values and procedures.
