Abstract

   This document identifies and discusses use-cases for transport
   independent OAM that need to interface multi-layer or multi-domain
   transport networks to cover heterogeneous networking technologies.
   As providers face multi-layer networks and diverse transport
   technologies, generic and integrated OAM is desirable for simplifying
   network operations and maintenance.

1.  Introduction

   This document discusses use-cases for transport independent OAM that
   need to interface multi-layer or multi-domain transport networks to
   to cover heterogeneous networking technologies.  As providers (e.g.,
   network providers, data center providers, etc.) face multi-layer
   networks and diverse transport technology, generic and integrated OAM
   is desirable for keeping network complexity down and simplifying OAM.

   This document is a part of the TIME effort, called Transport
   Independent OAM in Multi-Layer Environment.  The goal of TIME is as
   follows

   o  Understand and discuss situations where an OAM protocol can be
      tuned and optimized for a specific data plane.

   o  OAM consolidation in the data plane:

      *  Exchange OAM information at the service layer atop of layer 3.

      *  Deployed over various encapsulating protocols, and in various
         medium types

   o  OAM consolidation in the management plane:

      *  Abstract OAM information common to different layers.

      *  Expose OAM information via unified interface to management
         entities, independently of the layer they belong to.

      *  Discuss how information gathered from various layers can be
         correlated for the sake of network operations optimization
         purposes.

      *  Propose means to help during service diagnosis; these means may
         rely on filtering information to be leaked to other layers so
         that time recovery can be optimized.  A typical example would
         be efficient root cause analysis that is fed with input from
         various layers.

      *  Propose means that would help to optimize a network as a whole
         instead of the monolithic approach that is specific to a given
         layer.  For example, investigate means that would help in
         computing diverse and completely disjoint paths, not only at
         layer 3 but also at the physical layer.

   These objectives are not frozen; further discussion is required to
   target key issues and scope the work to be conducted within IETF
   accordingly.

   The problem statement and architecture is discussed in [TIME-PS].

   Figure 1 illustrates a multi-layer network in which IP traffic
   between two customer edges is transported over an IP/MPLS provider

   Figure 1 illustrates a multi-layer network in which IP traffic
   between two customer edges is transported over an IP/MPLS provider
   network and multiple layers OAMs are used.  Ethernet OAM is used at
   the customer level for monitoring the end-to-end connection between
   the two customer edges, while IP OAM is used at the provider level
   for monitoring the connection between any two provider edges in each
   network.  In addition to Ethernet OAM, transport independent OAM is
   also used for monitor end to end connection between the two customer
   edges at the abstract level.

   With transport independent OAM in the data plane, a user who wishes
   to issue a IP Ping Command or use connectivity verification command
   can do so in the same manner regardless of the underlying protocol or
   transport technology.  Consider a scenario where both Ethernet OAM
   and IP OAM can be decomposed into a set of various OAM functions and

   an Ethernet OAM can be integrated with IP OAM in one protocol.  When
   one OAM function is invoked, it will be invoked in the same way as
   the other OAM function regardless of the underlying protocol.

   Alternatively, when Ethernet OAM and IP OAM can be consolidated
   through uniformed interface at the management plane, A user who
   wishes to issue a IP Ping command or a IP Traceroute or initiate a
   session monitoring can also do so in the same manner regardless of
   the underlying protocol or technology.

   Consider a scenario where an IP ping to PE B from CE A failed.
   Between CE A and PE B there are IEEE 802.1 bridges a,b and c.  Let's
   assume a,b and c are using [8021Q] CFM.  Upon detecting IP layer ping
   failure, the user may wish to "go down" to the Ethernet layer and
   issue the corresponding fault verification (LBM) and fault isolation
   (LTM) tools, using the same API.

   In Service Function Chain, the service packets are steered through a
   set of Service Function Nodes distributed in the network.  Overlay
   technologies (or tunneling techniques in general) can be used to
   stitch these Service Function Nodes in order to form end to end path.

   When the service packet enters into the network, OAM information
   needs to be imposed by ingress node of the network into the
   packet(e.g., packet header extension or TLV extension in the overlay
   header) and pass through the network in the same path as the service

   traffic and processed by a set of Service Functions that are hosted
   in Service Function Nodes and located in different layers at the top
   of layer 3.

   When any Service Function Nodes or any service segment between two
   service nodes fails to deliver user traffic, there is a need to
   provide a tool that would enable users to detect such failures, and a
   mechanism to isolate faults.

   In case of several SFs co-located in the same Service Function Node,
   the packet is processed by all SFs in the Service Function Node, Once
   the packet is successfully handled by one SF, the packet is forwarded
   to the next SF that is in the same Service Function Node.

   When the packet leave the network, the OAM information needs to
   stripped out from the packet.

   To provide unified view of OAM information common to different
   layers, different domains, different operators, these OAM information
   needs to gathered from various layer using different encapsulation
   and tunneling techniques and abstracted and provided to the
   management application via the unified management interface.

   As indicated in [I-D.boucadair-sfc-requirments], the following OAM
   functions are to be supported:

   o  Support means to verify the completion of the forwarding actions
      until the SFC Border Node is reached (see Section 3.4.1 of
      [RFC5706]).

   o  Support means to ensure coherent classification rules are
      installed in and enforced by all the Classifiers of the SFC
      domain.

   o  Support means to correlate classification policies with observed
      forwarding actions.

   o  Support in-band liveliness and functionality checking mechanisms
      for the instantiated Service Function Chains and the Service
      Functions that belong to these chains.

   Other service diagnosis and troubleshooting requirements are
   discussed in [I-D.boucadair-sfc-requirments].

   Overlay network is referred to a network that is built on top of
   another underlying network and provides various services to tenant
   system.  With the growth of network virtualization technology, the
   needs for inter-connection between various overlay technologies/
   networks (e.g., VXLAN or NVGRE) in the Wide Area Network (WAN) become
   important since it can provide end to end connectivity.

   When a packet traverses a set of overlay networks in the data path,
   each overlay network will comprise an overlay segment used to connect
   overlay nodes in the same network and these overlay segment are
   stitched together to form end to end data path.

   When any Overlay Segment fails to deliver user traffic, there is a
   need to provide a tool that would enable users to detect such
   failures, and a mechanism to isolate faults.  It may also be
   desirable to test the data path before mapping user traffic to the
   Overlay Segment.

3.  Requirements

   This section provides high-level requirements to fulfill transport
   independent OAM in Multi-layer Environment to support various use
   cases discussed in the previous sections.

   o  The interfaces between the management entity and each Managed
      device in the transport network domain SHOULD support standards-
      based abstraction with a common information/data model.

   o  The management entity should be able to create a single unified
      view of OAM information that is common to various layers, various
      domain and various operators.

   o  The following capability should be supported:

      *  Support customized service diagnostic.

      *  Support diagnose the availability of a End to End path.

      *  Support diagnose the availability of a segment Path that is
         subpath of end to end path.

      *  Support verification on the correct value of Path ID between
         any two pair of overlay nodes or any two pair of service nodes.

      *  Support verifying Overlay Control Plane and Data Plane
         consistency at either two overlay nodes or two service nodes.

      *  Support local diagnostic procedures specific to each Service
         Node.

      *  Support in-band liveliness and functionality checking
         mechanisms for the overlay node or service node.

      *  Support Trace on the underlying network.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
