      ProviderId is the IMG sender's or IMG transceiver's identifier.
      ProviderId MUST be an Internet domain name, and MUST be owned by
      the organization creating the IMG resource and allocating the URN
      to the resource, at the date identified by the DateId.
      DateId is a date in ISO 8601 Basic Format (CCYYMMDD), and MUST
      correspond to a day (starting 00:00 UTC) the organization
      allocating the URN owned the domain name specified in the
      ProviderId.  The organization MUST use the same date for all URNs
      it allocates.
      IMGRootId MUST be unique among all IMGRootIds emanating from the
      IMG sender or IMG transceiver identified by ProviderId and DateId.
      This identifier refers to a top-level entity in the data model
      used for IMG resources published by the organization identified by
      the ProviderID and DateID.  The data model and its semantics are
      defined by the organization.
      If an IMG sender assigns an identifier to a subset of metadata
      identified by an IMGRootId, it uses the same IMGRootId and a
      FragmentId.  The FragmentId MAY be an identifier corresponding to
      the structure of the metadata.  The sender or transceiver MUST
      assign FragmentIds that are unique among the FragmentIds with the
      same IMGRootId.

   Identifier Uniqueness considerations:

      The combination of ProviderId and DateId serves to uniquely
      identify the organization providing the IMG sender or IMG
      transceiver allocating the URN.  That organization is responsible
      for ensuring the uniqueness of the IMGRootId and the FragmentId.

   Identifier Persistence considerations:

      URNs of this namespace may only be allocated by an organization
      that owns an Internet domain name.  The URN identifies a date on
      which the organization owned that domain name.  The combination of
      domain name and date will serve to unambiguously and persistently
      identify that organization.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      The organization identified by the ProviderId/DateId combination
      is responsible for assigning an IMGRootId that is unique among all
      IMGRootId it allocates.

   Process for identifier resolution:

      IMG identifiers can be resolved using either data included in the
      IMG envelope or an external RDS.
      The IMG transfer envelope includes the identifies of the metadata
      the envelope is associated with.  Furthermore, the envelope can
      include URLs that can be used to access the metadata the envelope
      refers to.  IMG receivers MAY use this information to resolve the
      URN.  Receivers should, however, be aware the the URLs may be
      outdated and do not point to the sought metadata.
      IMG senders MAY provide URN resolution using the Dynamic
      Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) (see [4], [5], [6], and [7]).
      If this mechanism is available, receivers can locate an
      authoritative server for information about the sender of the IMG
      identified by a given URN using the process specified in [7].

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The ProviderId is case-insensitive.  The remainder of the NSS
      shall be considered case-sensitive.  Otherwise the rules defined
      in [2] apply.

   Conformance with URN syntax:

      When using format-specific syntaxes for identifying fragments in
      the FragmentId portion of the URN, senders MUST translate any
      character that is outside the URN character set using the rules
      defined in [2].

   Validation mechanism:

      None additional to resolution specified.

   Scope:

      Global.
