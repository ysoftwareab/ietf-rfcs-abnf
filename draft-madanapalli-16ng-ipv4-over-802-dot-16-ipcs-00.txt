Abstract

   IEEE 802.16 is an air interface specification for wireless broadband
   access.  IEEE has specified several service specific convergence
   sublayers (CS) for 802.16 which are used by upper layer protocols.
   The ATM CS and Packet CS are the two main service-specific
   convergence sublayers and these are a part of the 802.16 MAC which
   the upper layers interface to.  The packet CS is used for transport
   for all packet-based protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP), IEEE

   Std. 802.3 (Ethernet) and, IEEE Std 802.1Q (VLAN).  The IP specific
   part of the Packet CS enables transport of IPv4 packets directly over
   the 802.16 MAC.

   This document specifies the frame format, the Maximum Transmission
   Unit (MTU) and address assignment procedures for transmitting Pv4
   packets over IP Convergence Sublayer (IPCS) of IEEE 802.16.  This
   document describes on how to deal with Address Resolution Protocol
   (ARP) and Mapping of multicast IP address to MAC address.

Internet-Draft          IPv4 over 802.16's IP CS           February 2007


1.  Introduction

   802.16 [6] is a connection oriented access technology for the last
   mile without bi-directional native multicast support. 802.16 has only
   downlink multicast support and there is no mechanisms defined for
   mobile stations to be able to send multicast packets that can be
   mapped to downlink multicast connection.  And also 802.16 MAC does
   not use the Source and Destination MAC addresses, instead it uses the
   Connection Identifiers (CIDs), which are assigned dynamically while
   setting up the MAC connections, for transmitting the 802.16 frames
   between a Mobile Station and a Base Station.

   This document specifies a method for encapsulating and transmitting
   IPv4 [2] and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets over IP CS of
   IEEE 802.16.  This document also specifies the MTU and address
   assignment method for the 802.16 based networks using IPCS.  As the
   802.16 MAC does not use the source and destination MAC addresses for
   the frame transmission, this document recommends avoiding ARP and
   Mapping of multicast IP address to MAC address, and recommends always
   assigning a default gateway for the mobile stations.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].


2.  Terminology

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in [10],
   in addition to the ones specified in this section.

   Access Router (AR): An entity that performs an IP routing function to
   provide IP connectivity for Mobile Stations.  In WiMAX Networks, the
   AR is an Access Service Network Gateway.


3.  Typical Network Architecture for IPv4 over 802.16

   In a network that utilizes the 802.16 air interface the MS is
   attached to an Access Router (AR) through a Base Station (BS), a
   layer 2 entity.  The AR can be an integral part of the BS or the AR
   could be an entity beyond the BS within the access network.  IPv4
   packets between the MS and BS are carried over a point-to-point MAC
   transport connection which has a unique connection identifier (CID).
   The packets between BS and AR are carried using L2 tunnel (typically
   GRE tunnel) so that MS and AR are seen as layer 3 peer entities.  At
   least one L2 tunnel is required for each MS, so that IP packets can
   be sent to MSs before they acquire IP addresses.  The figure below

   The above network model serves as an example and is shown to
   illustrate the point to point link between the MS and the AR.  The L2
   tunnel is not required if BS and AR are integrated into a single box.

   IPv6 packets are transmitted in Generic 802.16 MAC frames as shown in
   the following figure.

5.  Maximum Transmission Unit

   The Length parameter of 802.16 MAC frame has a size of 11 bits.
   Hence the total PDU size is 2048 bytes.  The IPv4 payload can be a
   maximum value of 2038 bytes ( Total PDU size (2048) - (MAC Header (6)

   + CRC (4)).  The default MTU for IPv4 over 802.16 SHOULD be 1920,
   this would accommodate tunneling overhead for delivering the packets
   between BS and AR.  This size may be reduced or increased by a Path
   MTU Discovery [8] or by manual configuration of each MS.  The minimum
   and maximum MTUs for IPv4 packets over 802.16 with IPv4 CS are 576
   bytes and 2038 bytes respectively.


6.  IPv4 Address Assignment

   DHCP [4] SHOULD be used for assigning IPv4 address for the MSs.  DHCP
   messages are transported over 802.16 MAC transported connection to
   and from the AR.  In case DHCP server does not reside in AR, the AR
   SHOULD implement DHCP relay Agent [5].  The DHCP Relay Agent MUST
   store the information on which interface (L2 Tunnel) it has received
   the DHCP messages, so that it can relay the DHCP responses to the
   correct MS.


7.  Address Resolution Protocol

   The 802.16 frame header does not contain the source and destination
   MAC addresses, instead it uses the Connection Identifier (CID) for
   the MAC frames delivery.  This makes classical Address Resolution
   Protocol (ARP) [3] trivial and unnecessary.  If an MS initiates an
   ARP for address resolution, the AR SHOULD silently discard the ARP
   packet.  All the outgoing packets that arrive at IPv4 layer, should
   be given to 802.16's IPv4 CS, which would map the packets to
   appropriate MAC transport connection.

   The AR MUST be configured as the default gateway for the MSs that
   have been attached to it.  ICMP Router Discovery [9] may be used for
   discovering the AR IP address.


8.  IP Multicast Address Mapping

   Mapping of multicast IP address to a MAC address is not required as
   the 802.16 MAC address is not used for delivering the MAC frames.
   The 802.16 uses the Connection ID (CID) for frame delivery hence no
   address mapping is required.


9.  Sending and Receiving IPv4 Packets

   802.16 MAC is a point-to-multipoint connection oriented air-
   interface, and the process of sending and receiving of IPv4 packets
   is different from multicast capable shared medium technologies like

   Ethernet.

   Before any packets being transmitted, 802.16 transport connection
   must be established.  This connection is consists of 802.16 MAC
   transport connection between MS and BS and an L2 tunnel between BS
   and AR.  This 802.16 transport connection provides a point-to-point
   link between MS and AR. all the packets originated at the MS always
   reach AR before being transmitted to the final destination.

   IPv4 packets are carried directly in the payload of 802.16 frames
   when the IPv4 CS is used.  IPv4 CS classifies the packet based on
   upper layer (IP and transport layers)header fields to put the packet
   on one of the available connections identified by the CID.  The
   classifiers for the IPv4 CS are source and destination IPv4
   addresses, source and destinations ports, Type-of-Service and IP
   protocol field.  The CS may employ Packet Header Suppression (PHS)
   after the classification.

   The BS tunnels the packet that has been received on a particular MAC
   connection to the AR.  BS reconstructs the payload header if the PHS
   is in use before being the packet is tunneled to the AR.  Similarly
   the packets received on a tunnel interface from the AR, would be
   mapped to a particular CID using IPv4 classification mechanism.

   AR performs normal routing for the packets that it receives and
   forwards the packet based on its forwarding table.  However the DHCP
   relay agent in the AR, MUST maintain the tunnel interface on which it
   receives DHCP requests, so that it can relay the DHCP responses to
   the correct MS.  One way of doing this is to have a mapping between
   MAC address and Tunnel Identifier.


10.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies transmission of IPv4 packets over 802.16
   networks with IPv4 Convergence Sublayer and does not introduce any
   new vulnerabilities to IPv4 specifications or operation.  The
   security of the 802.16 air interface is the subject of [6].  In
   addition, the security issues of the network architecture spanning
   beyond the 802.16 base stations is the subject of the documents
   defining such architectures, such as WiMAX Network Architecture [7].


11.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
