       CDNI Capacity Insights Capability Advertisment Extensions
            draft-ryan-cdni-capacity-insights-extensions-00

Abstract

   Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Networks
   Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery
   Network (CDN) is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer
   serves as the downstream CDN (dCDN).  This document supplements to
   the CDNI Capability Objects defined in RFC 8008 and CDNI Metadata
   Objects in RFC 8006.  The defined Capability Objects structure and
   interface for advertisments and managment of a downstream CDN
   capacity.

1.  Introduction

   The Streaming Video Alliance [SVA] is a global association that works
   to solve streaming video challenges in an effort to improve end-user
   experience and adoption.  The Open Caching Working Group [OCWG] of
   the Streaming Video Alliance [SVA] is focused on the delegation of
   video delivery requests from commerical CDNs to a caching layer at
   the ISP's network.  Open Caching architecture is a specific use case
   of CDNI where the commercial CDN is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the
   ISP caching layer is the downstream CDN (dCDN).  While delegating

   traffic from one CDN to the other, it is important to make sure that
   an appropriate amount of traffic is delegated.  In order to achives
   that, the TBD: Open Caching Capacity Insight Specification [OC-CII]
   defines a feedback mechanism to inform the delegator how much traffic
   is appropriate to delegate.  The traffic level information provided
   by that interface will be consumed by entities, such as the Open
   Caching Request router, to help inform that entity's traffic
   delegation decisions.  This document defines and registers CDNI
   Payload Types (as defined at section 7.1 of [RFC8006]).  These
   Payload types are used for Capability Objects added to those defined
   at section 4 of [RFC8008], which are required for the Open Caching
   Capacity Insights Interface.

   For consistency with other CDNI documents this document follows the
   CDNI convention of uCDN (upstream CDN) and dCDN (downstream CDN) to
   represent the commercial CDN and ISP caching layer respectively.

   This document registers two CDNI Payload Types (section 7.1 of
   [RFC8006]) for the defined capability objects:

   o  Telemetry Payload Type: A payload type for the capability object
      which defines the supported telemetry sources, the metrics made
      available by that source, and corresponding configuration
      appropriate to the type of the source (host, port, protocol,
      etc..)

   o  CapacityLimits Payload Type: a payload type for the capability
      object which defines Capacity Limits based on a set of defined
      limit types and a mapping from those limits to corresponding
      telemetry sources for supporting real-time metrics.

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

   o  CDN - Content Delivery Network

   Additionally, this document reuses the terminology defined in
   [RFC6707], [RFC7336], [RFC8006], [RFC8007], [RFC8008], and [RFC8804].
   Specifically, we use the following CDNI acronyms:

   o  uCDN, dCDN - Upstream CDN and Downstream CDN respectively (see
      [RFC7336] )

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  CDNI Additonal Capability Objects

   Section 5 of [RFC8008] describes the FCI Capability Advertisement
   Object, which contains a CDNI Capability Object as well as the
   capability object type (a CDNI Paylod Type).  The section also
   defines the Capability Objects per such type.  Below we define two
   additional Capability Objects.

   Note: In the following sections, the term "mandatory-to-specify" is
   used to convey which properties MUST be included when serializing a
   given capability object.  When mandatory-to-specify is defined as
   "Yes" for an individual property, it means that if the object
   containing that property is included in an FCI message, then the
   mandatory-to-specify property MUST also be included.

2.1.  Telemetry Capability Object

   The Telemetry Capability Object is used to define a list of telemetry
   sources made available by the dCDN to the uCDN.

      Property: sources

2.3.  RequestedCapacityLimits Object

   To enable the uCDN to request changes in the dCDN limits, a new
   metadata object is introduced.  As metadata is associated with a
   host, the total limits for the uCDN on a particular footprint are
   associated with the "Distinguished CDN-Domain" as defined by
   [RFC7336].  This will typically be a host utilized in
   FCI.RedirectTarget, though it can be any arbitrary host as long as it
   is not one of the CDN-Domains used for serving client requests.  This
   host as used for requested changes in the total limits is defined in
   the total-limits-host property of FCI.CapacityLimits.  Similarly, an
   adjustment request for any CDN-Domain may be made using the same
   metadata object associated with the corresponding host.  These
   correspond to the limits defined as host-limits in
   FCI.CapacityLimits.

      Property: requested-limits

         Description: Capacity Limits being requedted by the uCDN to the
         dCDN.

         Type: A JSON array of Requested Limits objects (see
         Section 2.3.1).

         Mandatory-to-Specify: Yes.

2.3.1.  Requsted Limits Object

   The Requested Limit Object is build of an associated type, a value
   assocaited with the type, and the footprints that the limit should be
   associated with.

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  CDNI Payload Types

   As described in section 7.1 of [RFC8006] , the "CDNI Payload Types"
   subregistry was created within the "Content Delivery Network
   Interconnection (CDNI) Parameters" registry (TBD verify name or omit
   extra info).  The created namespace defines the valid Payload Types,
   and is already populated with the types described in Section 7.1 of
   [RFC8006] as well as the types described in section 6.1 of [RFC8008].

   This document requests the registration of the two additional payload
   types:

   +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+

   [RFC Editor: Please replace RFCthis with the published RFC number for
   this document.]

3.1.1.  CDNI FCI Telemetry Payload Type

      Purpose: The purpose of this Payload Type is TBD (maybe: to list
      the supported telemetry sources and the metrics made available by
      each source).

      Interface: FCI.

      Encoding: See section Section 2.1.

3.1.2.  CDNI FCI Capacity Limits Payload Type

      Purpose: The purpose of this Payload Type is TBD (maybe: defines
      Capacity Limits based on a set of defined limit types and a
      mapping from those limits to corresponding telemetry sources for
      supporting real-time metrics).

      Interface: FCI.

      Encoding: See section Section 2.2.

3.1.3.  CDNI MI Requested Capacity Limits Payload Type

      Purpose: The purpose of this Payload Type is to allow a uCDN to
      request a CapacityLimit update from a dCDN

      Interface: MI.

      Encoding: See section Section 2.3.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification is in accordance with the CDNI Request Routing:
   Footprint and Capabilities Semantics.  As such, it is subject to the
   security and privacy considerations as defined in Section 8 of
   [RFC8006] and in Section 7 of [RFC8008] respectively.
