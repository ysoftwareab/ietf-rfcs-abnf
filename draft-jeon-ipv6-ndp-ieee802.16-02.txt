Abstract

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol [RFC 2461] assumes that the
   underlying link layer support native multicast while IEEE 802.16 is a
   point-to-multipoint network without bi-directional native multicast
   support.  Such a discordance between IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol
   and IEEE 802.16 network results in the on-link and multicast issues.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 NDP for CPA in IEEE 802.16           June 2006


1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16 [IEEE 802.16][IEEE 802.16e] is a connection-oriented
   broadband wireless access(BWA) technology.  Down-stream in IEEE
   802.16 is a point-to-multipoint connection and thus it is possible to
   broadcast messages toward SS (Subscriber Station) from BS (Base
   Station).  However, up-stream is connected as point-to-point type.
   Therefore, SS is not capable of multicasting as well broadcasting.

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (IPv6 NDP) [RFC 2461] aims to solve
   problems due to the interaction between nodes attached on the same
   link.  It is designed without dependence on a specific link layer
   technology, but assumes that the link layer technology support a
   native multicasting.  As mentioned above, IEEE 802.16 supports
   multicast and broadcast in down-stream.  However, the original aim of
   the multicast and broadcast is to transmit IEEE 802.16 MAC management
   messages for bandwidth allocation, not IP data.  Thus, IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery message on IEEE 802.16 cannot be delivered to neighboring
   hosts by means of multicast.

   IPv6 NDP messages have link-local scoped address as IP destination
   address.  It means those messages have to be delivered toward on-link
   any hosts.  However, when all SSs under same BS are configured with
   common IPv6 network prefix, IEEE 802.16 disagrees with IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery on the definition of on-link host.  This is because IPv6
   NDP determines the on-link host with assigned prefixs while up-stream
   in IEEE 802.16 is a point-to-point connection.  IEEE 802.16 does not
   allow direct communication among SSs even though each SS knows that
   other SSs are neighboring ones at the IP level.  Eventually, this
   discrepancy results in limitation of transmission coverage of IPv6
   NDP messages with link-local scoped address.

   This document presents a mechanism which can allocate a common
   network prefix to all SS under the same IPv6 link.  Through the
   mechanism, the standard IPv6 NDP can be applied to IEEE 802.16
   networks without modifying conventional host-side operation.

4.  IPv6 Transmission Issues over IEEE 802.16

   This section summarizes issues about IPv6 transmission on IEEE 802.16
   under the condition all SSs are assigned with common prefix address.

4.1.  On-Link Issue

   The assignment of a common prefix to all SSs under a specific AR



Jeon & Jee              Expires December 28, 2006               [Page 4]

   means locating them "on-link" in terms of IP packet transfer.  From
   [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis], IP node determines destinations are on-link
   by performing a longest prefix match against the prefix list.
   Therefore, SSs sharing common prefix can be said to on-link IP nodes.

   IPv6 NDP is a protocol to solve problems due to the interaction
   between on-link nodes and requires direct communication between them.

   By the way, IEEE 802.16 is a connection-oriented network.  Even
   though all data in IEEE 802.16 can be broadcasted to air shared to
   all SSs, only SS associated with the CID included in the data can
   receive the data.  The connection of IEEE 802.16 always ends at the
   BS.  There is no support from 802.16 MAC/PHY for the direct
   communication among SSs [I-D.jee-16ng-ps-goals] which results in the
   problem of locating SSs on-link in terms of IP packet transfer.

4.2.  Multicast Issue

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages excepting Redirect are destined for
   link-local scoped multicast address such as all-router multicast
   address, all-node multicast address, and solicited-node multicast
   address.

   Currently, it is not sure for IEEE 802.16 to provide dedicated CIDs
   for multicasting IPv6 packet.  Thus, any available traffic CID value
   needs to be allocated for multicasting IPv6 packet.

   Another consideration on multicast transmission is to avoid all-node
   multicast transmission in order to prevent unrelated SSs from
   frequently being waken from idle mode.  Considering the limited
   battery capacity from small size of mobile devices, power saving is
   necessary to sustain the mobile devices alive for its lifetime.


5.  IEEE 802.16 Network Model and IPv6 NDP Operations

5.1.  IEEE 802.16 Network Model

   IEEE 802.16 based network architecture depends on its Convergence
   Sublayer (CS).  When IP CS is applied, BS and AR may need to be
   tightly coupled by physically or logically by tunneling mechanism
   like GRE Tunneling (Figure 1 and 2).  Therefore, IP packets which are
   destined for on-link IP nodes needs to be first transferred toward
   AR.  Special consideration is required on the AR in treating IPv6 NDP
   messages which have different destination forms like link-local
   unicast, link-local all-nodes multicast, link-local all-routers
   multicast and solicited node multicast address.

   In case of Ethernet CS, IEEE 802.16 deployment architecture can be
   configured as shown in Figure 3.  Assuming Ethernet link between BS
   and AR, we can consider similar bridging function on BS to one on
   WLAN access point.  Bridging function on BS is to interpret the
   Ethernet header of packets received from SS and transmit the packets
   toward expected next node.  In Figure 3, such an next node can be
   another BS, another SS, or AR.

5.2.  IPv6 NDP Operations

   Table 1 shows the relation between operations of IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery and the above two issues according to the applied CS.

   Router Discovery, Prefix Discovery, Parameter Discovery and Redirect
   among IPv6 NDP operations are performed between SS and AR.  Thus they
   does not come under the On-Link issue.  However, Multicast issue
   still remains to be solved excluding Redirect operation.

   As mentioned in Section 5.1, using IP CS always makes AR a neighbor
   of SS even though SS sends data to any SSs.  This fact indicates that
   Address Resolution, Next-hop Determination, Neighbor Unreachability
   Detection (NUD) and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) should be
   always performed toward AR.  Moreover, absent Ethernet header in data
   does not require Address Resolution.  Those abnormal operations occur
   due to On-Link issue.

   In case of Ethernet CS in Section 5.1, bridge function connects BSs
   under same AR and allows each SSs to communicate each other directly
   without detouring AR.  Therefore, all IPv6 NDP messages can be
   exchanged between SSs and there is no On-Link issue.  Note that IEEE
   802.16 BS should support local relay function in order to relay
   packets between SSs served by same BS.  However, Address Resolution
   and DAD using multicast transmission should be considered in terms of
   Multicast issue.

6.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Support over IEEE 802.16

6.1.  IP Convergence Sublayer

   By aforementioned "On-Link" issue, IEEE 802.16 does not support
   direct communication between on-link SSs.  Moreover, AR in IP CS case
   is always a next-hop neighbor even when SS sends data to on-link SSs
   and thus all data have to be sent to AR as mentioned in Section 5.1.
   As a result, the AR discards IPv6 NDP messages addressed link-local
   all-node multicast and solicited node multicast address because the
   messages do not intend for the AR.  Therefore, it is necessary to
   relay the restricted messages.

   Multicast Relaying Part (MRP) serves as packets relayer and is
   located in AR.  MRP over AR intercepts packets destined for the
   multicast addresses and then prepares packet relaying while passing
   those to upper layer.  Intercepting rule of MRP is different
   according to the case when IEEE 802.16 CS supports IPv6 over Ethernet
   or native IPv6.  In case of IP CS, MRP holds packets, which begin
   with FF02 in IPv6 address.  Note that the MRP does not intercept
   packets addressed FF02::2.  This is due to the assumption the AR
   serves as default router and there is no other router in the subnet.
   Table 2 shows IP multicast address types used in IPv6 NDP.

        xx:x is last 24 bits of a unicast IPv6 address.

                               Table 2


   When BS and AR are coupled as shown in Figure 1, AR should forward
   unicast packets destined for on-link host.  In the case, the packets
   must be transmitted again via the incoming interface and AR has to
   transmit Redirect message to sender whenever communication between
   on-link SSs occurs.  This problem can be issue in implementation of
   AR and MRP can treat the problem.

6.2.  Ethernet Convergence Sublayer

6.2.1.  Identification Cache Table

   Each BS maintains Identification Cache Table (ICT) on SSs covered by
   the BS.  The ICT contains L2, L3 address of SS, DAD flag, and
   corresponding CID.  If DAD flag is set, ICT includes tentative target
   address in DAD Neighbor Solicitation (NS).The ICT is constructed by
   following procedure.

   - BS can be known about L2 address on SS during the initial ranging
   procedure of IEEE 802.16 (refer to Section 6.3.1.1 in [IEEE 802.16]).

Internet-Draft       IPv6 NDP for CPA in IEEE 802.16           June 2006


   - BS can be known about CID on SS after the initial ranging
   procedure.

   - BS can be known about L3 address on SS with Target field in DAD NS
   which is not responded with DAD NA.

6.2.2.  Router Discovery, Prefix Discovery and Parameter Discovery

   Router Discovery, Prefix Discovery and Parameter Discovery procedures
   are achieved by receiving Router Advertisement (RA) message.  The RA
   is advertised by using all-node multicast transmission.  If IEEE
   802.16 does not support IPv6 multicast transmission, the multicast
   transmission should be emulated with the way described in Section 7.

   Considering the power consumption on SS, AR should just unicast the
   RA in response with RS without using all-node multicast transmission.
   It can prevent SS from frequently being waken in idle mode.

6.2.3.  Address Resolution

   When Serving SS sends NS for Address Resolution, bridge on Serving BS
   relays the NS toward backbone Ethernet link.  Each BSs attached the
   backbone receive the NS.

   If network approves the proxy function for NDP, Target BS refers the
   ICT and responds with NA.

   Otherwise, Target BS refers the ICT and then finds a CID
   corresponding to the target address in the NS, and relays the NS
   message toward its own air using the CID.  Target SS responds with
   NA.

6.2.4.  Duplicate Address Detection

   When Serving BS receive DAD NS from Serving SS, the Serving BS set
   DAD flag in ICT to non-zero and thus the Serving BS can be known who
   sends the DAD NS.  Bridge on Serving BS relays the NS for DAD toward
   backbone Ethernet link.  Each BSs attached the backbone receive the
   NS.

   If network approves the proxy function for NDP, Target BS refers the
   ICT to see whether the tentative target address in the NS exists in
   its own ICT table.  If it exists, Target BS responds with NA.
   Otherwise, discard the NS message silently.

   Otherwise, Target BS refers the ICT and then finds a CID
   corresponding to tentative target address in the NS, and relays the
   NS message toward its own air using the CID.  If the tentative target

Internet-Draft       IPv6 NDP for CPA in IEEE 802.16           June 2006


   address is in use, Target SS responds with NA.  Otherwise, the NS
   message is ignored.

   When each BS receives NA message, refer to DAD flag in ICT table to
   see whether Serving SS is located in its serving area.  If existing,
   the BS sends the NA using corresponding CID.  The CID is for unicast
   traffic.


7.  Multicast Transmission Emulation

   This section describes how to transmit the packets with link-local
   scoped multicast address into IEEE 802.16 network.  We suggest
   following two different approaches for the purpose of multicast
   emulation.

7.1.  Multicast Transmission Emulation using Common CID

   IEEE 802.16 enables multicast transmission in down-stream.  However,
   it is difficult to create and maintain CIDs for multicast because
   there can be manifold multicast sessions.  Therefore, this document
   defines Common CID (CCID) for transmitting multicast data.

   There is one unique CCID in BS and it is shared by all SSs served by
   the BS.  All SSs can receive data transmitted via the CCID and IPv6
   module in SSs see whether the multicast data are destined to
   themselves or not.

   Current IEEE 802.16 does not specify CID which can be shared by all
   SSs and used for IP data.  Following describes how to make CCID with
   existing MBS-CID.

   [IEEE 802.16e] proposes Multicast and Broadcast Service (MBS), which
   presents media service to SSs using multicast or broadcast.  Under
   MBS architecture, each SS selects MBS contents and then configures a
   corresponding CID by the DSA procedure.  Such a CID for MBS is
   referred to as MBS-CID.  MBS-CID is one of transport CIDs and is
   shared by all SSs requesting same media content.

   CCID can be seen as a special type of MBS-CID.  CCID is allocated to
   BS and all SSs served by the BS utilizing a general DSA procedure in
   MBS for transmitting link-local multicast data.  For the assigning
   the CCID, we assume that service flow for link-local multicast is
   globally defined and the service flow is known to BS and all SSs.
   Once initialization between BS and SS is completed, they perform DSA
   procedure for creating the link-local multicast service flow.  The
   detailed process creating new service flow and updating CS for
   mapping of the service flow to CCID is outside scope of this

   document.

   BS transmits IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages relayed by MRP towards
   all SSs via the CCID.

7.2.  Multicast Transmission Emulation using Replicated Unicast

   The transmission using CCID allows IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages
   to be delivered only once per transmission.  However, it requires a
   new CID for multicast.  This section shows how to transmit IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery messages with existing unicast CID.

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery message can be delivered by repeated unicast
   transmissions towards SSs involved in the multicast address of the
   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery message.

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages with link-local all node multicast
   address should be sent to all SSs and thus they can be transmitted by
   replicated unicasts via all established CIDs on BS.

   In this context, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages with solicited-node
   multicast address should be transmitted by replicated unicasts via
   CIDs of corresponding SSs.  Thus, it is required to identify CIDs for
   solicited-node multicast addresses.

   Section 6.3.1.1 in [IEEE 802.16] states that a 48-bit universal MAC
   address of SS is used during the initial ranging process to identify
   connections to SS.  Solicited-node multicast address of SS can be
   derived by the MAC address.  As a result, BS can be aware of the
   solicited-node multicast addresses with the known MAC address of each
   SS and match the derived addresses with each CIDs.


8.  Security Considerations

   IEEE 802.16e architecture supports a number of mandatory
   authorization mechanisms such as EAP-TTLS, EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA.

   [RFC 3971] specifies security mechanisms for NDP and defines securing
   NDP messages.

   Basically, our approach of using "MRP" enables SSs to exchange IPv6
   NDP messages directly without depending on any proxy function at the
   AR or BS.  Therefore, it has advantage in securing NDP messages by
   the mechanism specified from [RFC 3971].
