Internet-Draft                  DHT Based                   October 2009


1.  Introduction

   It is common recognized that today!_s Internet routing and addressing
   system is facing serious scaling problems, which is much discussed in
   the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) workshop on Routing and
   Addressing in Amsterdam.  Several proposals have emerged after the
   workshop.  These proposals include LISP [LISP], are based on the idea
   of "ID/Locator split, and need a mapping mechanism that allows to map
   identifiers onto locators.  Server mapping mechanisms have been
   proposed [APT][ALT] [LISPDHT].

   Differently from [APT], which is a concentration mapping solution and
   every AS maintains a default server that stores complete EID-to-RLOC
   mappings, and [ALT], which is in a distributed manner but the EID
   prefix must be assigned in a hierarchical manner and be aggregated,
   this draft proposes a DHT based distributed mapping server solution.

   This document proposes a method of building a logical distributed
   overlay, which is used to store the EID-to-RLOC in the DHT ring.  The
   overlay is deployed in an AS, and the cross domain communication is
   through the DHT Border Server which is used to flood the inter-EID
   prefix and forward the cross domain data packet.


2.  Definition of Terms

   Endpoint ID (EID): a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for IPv6) value
   used in the source and destination address fields of the first (most
   inner) LISP header of a packet.  The host obtains a destination EID
   the same way it obtains a destination address today, for example
   through a DNS lookup or SIP exchange.  Usually, the EID is an IP
   address.  If the host is required to support mobility, the EID should
   be unique.

   Routing Locator (RLOC): the IPv4 or IPv6 address of an egress tunnel
   router (ETR).  It is the output of an EID-to-RLOC mapping lookup.  An
   EID maps to one or more RLOCs.

   Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR): a router which accepts an IP packet with
   a single IP header (more precisely, an IP packet that does not
   contain a LISP header).  The router treats this "inner" IP
   destination address as an EID and performs an EID-to-RLOC mapping
   lookup through a mapping service.  The router then prepends an
   "outer" IP header with one of its globally-routable RLOCs in the
   source address field and the result of the mapping lookup in the
   destination address field.  An ITR maintains a local mapping table
   that stores some recently used EID-to-RLOC mapping.  An ITR also
   maintains a timer for each EID-to-RLOC mapping.  If the timer of an

   EID-to-RLOC mapping exceeds a predetermined threshold, the ITR will
   remove the EID-to-RLOC mapping from its local mapping table, and send
   a mapping leave message to the DHT server.  In addition, an ITR may
   also be an ETR, and vice versa.

   Egress Tunnel Router (ETR): a router that accepts an IP packet where
   the destination address in the "outer" IP header is one of its own
   RLOCs.  The router strips the "outer" header and forwards the packet
   based on the next IP header found.  In general, an ETR receives LISP-
   encapsulated IP packets from the Internet on one side and sends
   decapsulated IP packets to site end-systems on the other side

   EID-to-RLOC mapping: a binding between an EID and the RLOC-set that
   can be used to reach the EID.  An RLOC-set may contain multiple RLOC,
   and perhaps the preference to an RLOC.

   DHT Server: a node in the DHT system that stores EID-to-RLOC mapping
   in its main mapping table and backup mapping table.

   DHT Border Server: a DHT Server, which is in the border of the LISP
   DHT Overlay.  DHT Border Server not only stores the EID-to-RLOC
   mapping, but also floods the aggregation EID prefix to other LISP DHT
   Overlay domains.


3.  DHT based overlay

   Figure 1 shows the DHT based overlay network, which consists of two
   parts: one is the internet, and the other is the overlay network.
   The internet comprises provider networks that provide data forwarding
   service.  The overlay network is on the top of the provider networks,
   and provides the EID-to-RLOC resolution system, and maintains the
   EID-to-RLOC mapping system.

5.  ID/Locator Mapping Resolution

5.1.  Registration of EID-to-RLOC mapping

   Whenever an end host attaches to an ETR, it should obtain a locator
   from the ETR and register this EID-to-RLOC mapping to the resolution
   system.  The Registration of EID-to-RLOC mapping is as the following:

   (1) The end host sends a message to its ETR to indicate that it will
   access the provider networks through the ETR.  The message includes
   the EID of the end host.

   (2) When the ETR receives this message, it first finds in its local
   mapping cache whether there is a record of the EID-to-RLOC mapping
   for the EID.  If it does, the ETR should check whether the locator in
   the existing EID-to-RLOC mapping that belongs to the ETR or not.  If
   there is not an EID-to-RLOC mapping for the EID at the ETR!_s local
   cache or the existing locator does not belong to the ETR, the ETR
   should assign a locator for the EID and stores the new EID-to-RLOC
   mapping to its local mapping cache.  In addition, the ETR sets a
   timer for the EID-to-RLOC mapping and sends this mapping to the
   default DHT Server.

   (3) When the default DHT Server receives an EID-to-RLOC mapping for
   an EID, it hashes the EID to the mapping system.  The destination DHT

Internet-Draft                  DHT Based                   October 2009


   stores the EID-to-RLOC mapping in its mapping table.

5.2.  Update message

   The end host sends a message periodically to its default ETR.  When
   the ETR receives the message, it finds in its local mapping cache.
   If it done, ETR updates the timer for the EID-to-RLOC mapping and
   sends an update message to the default DHT Server of the DHT ring
   system.

5.3.  Leave message

   When an end host leaves from an ETR, it may send a message to the ETR
   to indicate this leave.  Or, the ETR may detect the leave of an end
   node.  In any case, the ETR should remove the EID-to-RLOC mapping and
   send a leave message to the DHT Server system.

5.4.  Resolving a RLOC for an EID

   When an ITR receives a packet with a destination EID, it should look
   up in its local cache whether or not there is an EID-to-RLOC mapping
   for the EID.  If it can not finds a RLOC for the EID, which means
   that it is the first packet to the destination EID.  The process of
   the resolving is in the following:

   (1) The ITR sends a mapping request to the default DHT Server of the
   DHT mapping system.  The mapping request contains the destination EID
   information, the data packet, and possibly some signature used for
   security.

   (2) When the default DHT Server receives the request, it hashes the
   EID in the mapping system.

   (3) When the destination DHT Server receives the mapping request, it
   finds the EID-to-RLOC mapping in its main mapping table.  If it does,
   the DHT Server encapsulates the data packet included in the mapping
   request and sends the new data packet to the ETR according the record
   of the RLOC.  The DHT Server sends a mapping reply to the source ITR.

   (4) When the ITR receives the mapping reply message, it stores this
   mapping into its local mapping cache.  When subsequent packets
   arrive, the ITR simply encapsulates them and sends the new data
   packets into the DFZ.

6.1.  Intra-AS domain data packet forwarding

   The communicated hosts are between one domain, and the EIDs mapping f
   the hosts are stored in the same overlay, which is called intra-AS
   domain communication.  The principle of intra-AS communication is
   very simple.  The process is described as following:

   (1)Host1wants to communicate with host2, and sends a IP packet(a IPv4
   packet or IPv6 packet, whatever) to its default ITR.  The destination
   IP address and source IP address of the IP packet are the EID address
   of host2 and host1 respectively;

   (2)When ITR receives the IP packet, it looks up the RLOC of the EID2
   in the local cache.  If it finds the RLOC, it means that the packet
   is not the first packet, and skips into step 6 indirectly;

   (3)ITR encapsulates the LISP-Request message and sends to the DHT
   Server for requesting the RLOC of EID2;

   (4)When DHT Server receives LISP-Request, it looks up the RLOC in the
   distributed mapping database.  Then DHT Server encapsulates the LISP-
   Reply response message;

   (5)When ITR receives the LISP-Reply message, it stores the EID-to-RLC
   mapping into its local cache.

   (6)ITR prepends LISP data packet with a outer IP header.  The
   destination and source IP address of outer IP header are RLOC of ETR
   and ITR respectively;

   (7)The LISP data packet routes and forwards based on the destination
   RLOC of the outer IP packet;

   (8)after the LISP data packet reaches the ETR, it will be
   unencapsulated in the ETR.  The ETR strips the outer IP header and
   remains the original IP packet;

   (9)the IP packet forwards to the destination host2.

6.2.  Inter-AS domain data packet forwarding

   The communication hosts are between to different domain and the EID
   mapping of hosts are stored in different DHT overlay, which is
   inter-AS domain communication.  The inter-AS domain communication is
   based on DHT Border Server.  The process is as following:

   (1)Host1wants to communicate with host3, and sends a IP packet(a IPv4
   packet or IPv6 packet, whatever) to its default ITR.  The destination

Internet-Draft                  DHT Based                   October 2009


   IP address and source IP address of the IP packet are the EID address
   of host3 and host1 respectively;

   (2)When ITR receives the IP packet, it looks up the RLOC of the EID3
   in the local cache.  If it finds the RLOC, it means that the packet
   is not the first packet, and skips into step 6 indirectly;

   (3)ITR encapsulates the LISP-Request message and sends to the DHT
   Server for requesting the RLOC of EID3;

   (4)When DHT Server receives the LISP-Request messageGBP[not]it looks
   up the RLOC in the distributed mapping database.  Because the
   information of EID is not stored in the local distributed mapping
   database, the mapping can not find in the local overlay mapping
   database.  The DHT Server encapsulates the LISP-Reply message, and
   the RLOC information filed is blank;

   (5)When ITR receives the ISP-Reply message with the blank RLOC, it
   stores the mapping relation of EID and RLOC into its local cache and
   marks the attribute with external EID information;

   (6)DHT Border Server encapsulates the LISP data packet with
   prepending a new IP header.  The destination and source IP address of
   the outer IP packet are the RLOC address of DHT Border Server and ITR
   respectively;

   (7)The LISP data packet forwards to the DHT Border Server based on
   the destination RLOC of the outer IP header;

   8)The outer IP packet is striped in the DHT Border Server, while the
   inner packet is remained.  The DHT Border Server looks up in the BGP
   routing table to match the destination EID;

   (9)The IP packet forwards to the DHT Border Server where is the same
   domain with host3;

   (10)DHT Border Server looks up the RLOC of the EID3;

   (11)When finds the RLOC, the IP packet will be reencapsulate with the
   destination and source IP address of outer IP header as RLOC of DHT
   Border Server and EID3.  The inner packet remains unchanged;

   (12)LISP data packet forwards to the ETR;

   (13)When the data packet reaches the ETR, the ETR strips the outer IP
   packet header and remains the inner IP header;

   (14)the inner IP header routes according to the EID, and forwards to
