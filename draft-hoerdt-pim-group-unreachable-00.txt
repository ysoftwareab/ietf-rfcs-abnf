Abstract

   Currently, PIM-SM is the most widely deployed multicast routing
   protocol in the Internet.  However in IPv6 this multicast protocol
   lacks a simple connectivity debugging tool, making it difficult to
   identify multicast routing problems.  When a host wants to receive a
   multicast group or channel, if the corresponding PIM-Join message

   cannot be propagated in the network, nothing exists to inform the
   receiver or the network about this failure.  We propose a simple
   error notification message based on ICMP/ICMP6 which is able to
   indicate where and why the error happened in the network without
   using a multicast traceroute mechanism.

Internet-Draft         Multicast Group Unreachable             June 2006


1.  Introduction

   With the current specification of PIM-SM [1], when a router cannot
   propagate a join message, nothing can be done to inform either
   receivers or downstream routers.  Therefore a useless multicast tree
   is maintained from receivers to the point of failure, while receivers
   needlessly wait for multicast data.  Such a failure may be due for
   example to a temporary routing problem (a source or RP is not
   currently reachable), a configuration problem (RP adressing, ...) or
   a user error (the source address of an SSM channel is not an existing
   address).

   The basic proposed idea is to send a downstream error message when a
   Join message propagation fails at some point in the network.  This
   may occur towards a source (S) both for a PIM-SM[5] SSM channel or
   for a SPT tree for a PIM-SM[1] ASM group; This may also occur between
   the DR and the rendez-vous point (RP) for an ASM group.  This error
   message, later on called Group Unreachable or GU, is carried over the
   ICMP/ICMP6[2][3] protocol.  This draft specifies:
   -  the rules used to send and propagate this message down the
      multicast tree.
   -  the ICMP/GU message format.
   -  the proposed error codes.
   The message is forwarded hop-by-hop by routers, it is not sent to the
   group address contained in the failing join.  The rules to process
   this message by multicast hosts is not in the scope of this draft.

   This mechanism is simpler than a multicast traceroute but still very
   useful.  It provides multicast listeners with a report including both
   problem location and problem description.  It helps network
   administrators reporting the problem to the person responsible of the
   good operation of multicast routing for the indicated location.  The
   proposed message could be used by diagnostic applications such as
   ssmping or asmping[6] to locate the point of failure in case of
   unreachability.  Some user applications could also make use of it,
   for example to warn the user and/or to leave the corresponding group
   or channel.  As this mechanism requires to be deployed on all
   multicast routers to operate properly, it requires standardisation.


2.  Protocol description

   When a router R fails to send a Join message towards a rendez-vous
   point RP or a source S, it triggers the sending of an ICMP/ICMP6
   Group Unreachability (GU) message.  GU messages MAY aggregate Join
   failure reasons for several unreachable RP(s)/source(s).  In order to
   locate the point of failure, the GU message contains the address of
   R.

   To inform all the downstream tree routers and hosts about a failure,
   a GU message is propagated hop-by-hop downstream the multicast tree
   concerned by the failure (the tree corresponding to the failing Join
   message).  Along these trees, this information could be taken into
   account in order to reduce the cost of useless/problematic multicast
   branches.  This is beyond the scope of this document.

2.1.  Sending GU Messages

   GU messages are sent both when a failure occurs on an existing tree
   or when a new branch is under construction.  In both cases, each
   failed Join message triggers the sending of a GU message.  If the
   failure is due to a transient error such as a temporary routing
   problem, the router may choose to suppress the GU message.

   On interdomain links and routers, the number of maintained groups/
   channels can be high.  A single failure on those links may trigger a
   high number of GU messages sharing the same point of failure.  To
   reduce the cost of the protocol in this case, GU messages sent on a
   link MAY aggregate unreachability information for several groups/
   channels having receivers through this link.

   The GU message size is limited to the link MTU.  If the number of
   groups/channels to aggregate exceeds this size, unreachability
   information is fragmented into multiple GU messages.  To avoid the
   sending of a burst of GU messages, the messages should be rate
   limited.

   When a multicast router R is unable to send a group/channel Join
   message, it builds for each failed group/channel a Group Record
   containing its failure information like group/channel identification,
   error code, etc... (detailled format in Section 3).  For each
   outgoing interface of at least one failing tree, the corresponding
   Group Records are gathered in the same GU Record.

   Then a GU message, possibly aggregating several GU records for this
   interface is built.  The destination address of the GU messages using
   this interface MUST be All_Systems_on_this_Subnet group address
   (224.0.0.1) in IPv4, or ALL_NODES_ADDRESS group address (FF02::1) in
   IPv6.  This ensures that all receivers for the failing group will
   received the GU message, together with all PIM Routers on the same
   interface.  A further study could determine if the use of a specific
   multicast address would be more efficient.  In this case the
   destination address would be All_Multicast_Reception_Hosts group
   address (224.0.0.X) in IPv4 and ALL_MULTI_REC_NODES group address
   (FF02::X) in IPv6 (X to be defined by IANA).

2.2.  Receiving/Forwarding GU Messages

   GU messages are forwarded hop-by-hop according to the TIB (Tree
   Information Base) maintained by the multicast routing protocol.  When
   a router R receives a GU message on an interface:
   -  If the source address of the received message is not the address
      of a PIM neighbor for the interface the GU message MUST be
      silently ignored.
   -  If there is no group/channel in the GU message for which the
      receiving interface is the incoming interface, the message must be
      silently ignored.

   The GU message is forwarded on all interested interfaces after a
   possible trimming.  An interface i is interested by the GU if and
   only if the GU contains a group or channel such that:
   (1) the GU was received by the incoming interface for this group/
      channel
   (2) interface i is an outgoing interface for this group/channel.  The
      GU sent through interface i is trimmed such that it contains only
      groups/channels satisfying conditions (1) and (2).
   (3) Channel unreachability information (concerned by specific source
      S and group G) is only forwarded hop-by-hop down to a shared tree
      (*,G) using TIB states if the bit R is set in the GU Record.  RP
      unreachability information is propagated on the shared (*,G) tree
      without setting this bit.

   Normally, if a join (S,G) fails the GU is sent only down the (S,G)
   tree to the DRs (and eventually to the receivers).  In some ASM cases
   a join (S,G) may fail between the RP and the FHR.  In this case the
   GU will travel down to the RP, and if the RP has no outgoing
   interface for (S,G), the GU will stop there.  The RP may choose to
   propagate the GU(S,G) message down the shared tree.  If it do so, the
   RP MUST take care that this message can be distinguished from regular
   GU(S,G) messages.  The R bit tells that.  Note that such a message
   may help debug a problem between the RP and the source, but this
   problem may have no direct impact on receivers, if they reach the
   source by another route.

   This bit is set by the router propagating a GU(S,G) through the
   shared tree, and then this GU should be transparently forwarded hop-
   by-hop down to the shared tree.

   Several GU messages for the same interface, possibly originating from
   different routers MAY be aggregated in the same ICMP message.


3.  Message format

   Join messages sent by a router summarize for a given interface the
   group(*,Gn)/channel(Sn,Gn) join state information.  These messages
   are sent to maintain a connection towards the root of the tree
   (Rendez-vous Point or Source).  To inform downstream tree members of
   a Join propagation failure, each group/channel which cannot be
   connected to its tree root will be included into a GU message.

   GU messages are a part of ICMP (in IPv4) or ICMP6 (in IPv6) messages.

   Over IPv4, GU messages are encapsulated in IPv4 datagrams with a
   protocol number of 1.  Every GU message is sent with an IP Time-To-
   Live of 1.  IPv4 GU message MUST only contain unreachability
   information about IPv4 addresses.

   Over IPv6, GU messages are encapsulated in IPv6 packets with a Next
   Header value of 58.  An IPv6 GU messages MUST be sent with a link-
   local source address, and hop limit set to 1.  IPv6 GU message MUST
   only contain unreachability information about IPv6 addresses.

   A GU message uses the common ICMP/ICMP6 structure.  Each ICMP/GU
   messages can carry several GU records concerning each an error
   location (i.e. router interface).  In the following text we use
   ICMP/GU to refer to ICMP/GU or ICMP6/GU messages.  So, information
   specific to a protocol family (IPv4/IPv6) will be specified
   explicitely.

   A single Group Records informs about a single group address
   associated with a single problem notification.  GU Records agregate
   Group Records with the same failing router address.  GU messages
   agregate GU Records which MAY come from different router address.
   Respective figures 1,2 and 3 explicit the format for GU messages, GU
   Records and Group Records.

   New Type and Code values must be used to identify new ICMP/ICMP6
   Group Unreachability (GU) messages.  Type and Code values must be
   defined by IANA.  This GU header can be common to several GU messages
   (until reaching MTU value).  Each of them regarding failure on a
   specific router.

   GU Records on figure 2 have the format presented for 32 bits IPv4
   addresses.  When using IPv6, all addresses will have a size of 128
   bits.

   Identifies the GU messages in the ICMP/ICMP6 messages family.

3.2.  Checksum

   The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement
   sum of the whole ICMP/ICMP6 GU message (the entire IP payload).  For
   computing the checksum, the Checksum field is set to zero.  When
   receiving packets, the checksum must be verified before processing
   the message.

3.3.  L (The 'Last GU Record' bit)

   When an ICMP/GU message carries several GU Records, flag L of the
   last GU Record MUST be set to 1.  All intermediate GU Records MUST
   have flag L set to 0.  If an ICMP/GU message carries a single GU
   Record, flag L of this record MUST be set to 1.

3.4.  Reserved1

   The Reserved1 field is reserved for future usage.  It is set to zero
   on emission and ignored on reception.

3.5.  Number of Group Records

   The Number of Group Records (M) specifies how many Group Records
   (information regarding unreachable group/channel) are present in the
   GU Record.

3.6.  Router Address

   The Router Address is used to identify the router on which the Join
   message propagation failure occurred.  This address should be chosen
   among the routers addresses with the largest scope (ie public
   addresses for IPv4, global addresses for IPv6 if available).

3.7.  Group Record

   Each Group Record of a GU Record contains information corresponding
   to a group/channel that could not be propagated in a Join message by
   the router designated by the Router Address (section Section 3.6).

3.8.  Error Code

   The four fields R,S,Res,Err Cde (Error Code) pertains to the same
   global error code which gives an indication about the type of failure
   occuring during the Join message propagation.

3.8.1.  R (The 'shaRed' tree bit)

   The R bit is set when a GU information triggered by a Join (S,G) must
   be propagated in the shared tree.  It is typically used to propagated
   a failure related to the PIM-SM RP-SPT Switch.

3.8.2.  S (The 'Source' or RP bit)

   The S bit indicates if the Join error is related to a forwarding
   error towards a Rendez-vous Point (S is set to 0) or towards a Source
   (S is set to 1).

3.8.3.  Res

   These two bits are reserved for a future usage.  They are set to zero
   on emission and ignored on reception.

3.8.4.  Error Cde

   The Err Cde (Error Code) field is a code that defines a more precise
   error type if known.  A first list of possible error Code values and
   their signification is given in Section 4.

3.9.  Reserved2

   The Reserved field is reserved for future usage.  It is set to zero
   on emission and ignored on reception.

3.10.  Number of Unicast Address

   The Number of Unicast Address (N) field specifies how many unicast
   IPv4/IPv6 addresses (RP/Sources) are present in this Group Record.
   This allows to determine the size of the current Group Record

3.11.  Multicast Address

   The Multicast Address field contains the IPv4/IPv6 multicast group
   address to which this Group Record pertains.

3.12.  Unicast Address [i]

   The Unicast Address list is a vector of n IPv4/IPv6 unicast
   addresses, where n is the value in this record's Number of Unicast
   Addresses (N) field.  The unicast addresses are either Rendez-vous
   Point or Source addresses depending on the S flag of this record.

   If the S bit is set to 0, this error occured in the ASM shared tree
   towards the RP.  In this case Unicast Address [0] is the RP address
   contained in the failing Join message, while Unicast Address [1] is
   the RP address known for this group in this router or the NULL
   address if there is no local RP information for this group.  If the S
   bit is set to 1, this error occured in an SSM or an ASM SPT tree.
   The list of Unicast Adresses is the list of failing sources for the
   same group, usually only one in the SSM case.


4.  GU Error codes

   The error code indicates the reason of the failure incured by a Join
   message forwarded hop-by-hop towards a source (S), if bit S is set or
   a Rendez-vous Point (RP), if bit S is cleared.  Code values and
   signification are proposed in the table below.  They are only
   suggestions to future definition by IANA.

   of S.


5.  Security Consideration

   A GU message is an informational message.  In this proposal it is
   only forwarded by routers and does not interact much more with them.

   With this proposal, an important number of non-existent trees could



Hoerdt, et al.          Expires December 11, 2006              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         Multicast Group Unreachable             June 2006


   be joined by a set of malicious hosts in the network, possibly
   triggering a storm of GU messages and exausting the ressources
   available by trying to signal a malicious error case.  This control
   plane attack is already possible without the GU message [4].  GU
   messages rate limitation MUST be available in order to minimize the
   additionnal cost on the network ressources in this kind of attack.

   The detailed usage of information carried by the GU message is out of
   the scope of this draft but Forged GU messages could be sent in non
   failing trees making the receivers believe that the multicast
   connection failed at some point in time.  To prevent that, only GU
   messages from known neighbors SHOULD be accepted by routers
   propagating the unreachability information.
