Abstract

   This document registers the Enumservice 'void' using the URI schemes
   'mailto:' and 'http:' as per the IANA registration process defined in
   the ENUM specification, RFC3761.  This Enumservice may be used to
   indicate that the E.164 number (or E.164 number range) tied to the
   domain in which the enclosing NAPTR is published is not assigned for
   communications service.  When such an indication is provided, an ENUM
   client can detect calls that will fail "early".

2.  Introduction

   The Circuit Switched Network (CSN) of which the Public Switched
   Telephone Network, Integrated Services Digital Network, and Public
   Land Mobile Network are part is designed to use E.164 numbers E.164
   [2] as native global addresses.  If a potential caller has an E.164
   number, then to place a call using this address has needed a way to
   pass the request either directly or indirectly to systems "in" the
   CSN for them to forward.

   ENUM has introduced a mechanism to find other contact addresses when
   given an E.164 number.  Thus, if the caller (or an agent somewhere in
   the call path) has access to the global DNS, they can use ENUM
   RFC3761 [3] to find alternative contacts to the E.164 number and
   place the call using whatever system was indicated in those contacts.

   However, ENUM entries may not exist for a given E.164 number for two
   reasons.  Either the assignee who is entitled to register an ENUM
   domain associated with the E.164 number they hold has chosen not to
   request this registration, or the number is not currently assigned
   for communications service.

   In either situation, the caller has no other information and so no
   alternative to placing the call via the system that uses E.164
   numbers as global identifiers; at present, this is the CSN.

3.  The Problem

   At present, from the ENUM client's perspective, two possibilities
   exist: there is an ENUM domain that potentially holds alternative
   contacts, or there is no ENUM domain, in which case a query on ENUM
   will return a DNS response showing 'no such domain' (NXDOMAIN, code
   3)[4].

   This latter response is ambiguous.  There are two potential reasons
   for the lack of an ENUM domain holding alternative contacts; either
   the assignee has chosen not to register the domain, or the E.164
   number is not assigned for communications service at present.

   If the number is assigned, then the caller can use the E.164 number
   to place the call via a network that uses such identifiers as global
   addresses (i.e. the CSN).  If however, there is no domain because the
   associated E.164 number is not assigned for communications service,
   then any attempt to place the call via the CSN will fail.

   What would be useful is a mechanism "between" a registration holding
   NAPTRs with URIs and the lack of a domain registration.  In this way,
   an entity who is responsible for E.164 numbers in a range can
   indicate that a particular number has not been assigned to anyone for
   communications service.  For example, if a communications service
   provider has been allocated responsibility for delivering calls to
   endpoints identified with E.164 numbers in a block, then they may
   have some numbers in that block that are currently unused.  These
   E.164 numbers are not used to terminate calls to end users.

   An originating user agent cannot differentiate this state from the
   one in which there is an end user as a number assignee, but that end
   user has have chosen not to "publish" other contacts.  In effect, it
   would be more useful if the originating end user could receive a
   response that states "there is no service via this number", as
   opposed to "there may be service via this number, but there are no
   alternative contacts available".

4.  The Proposed Solution

   We propose an explicit indication of this "number unassigned" state.
   This uses a NAPTR in the "enclosing" zone, with an Enumservice called
   VOID that should be taken as an assertion that the associated E.164
   number is not assigned to an end user for communications service;
   it's an unused number.

   This NAPTR can also be used by a National Regulatory Authority (NRA)
   to indicate number blocks that it has reserved or has not allocated,
   or has not assigned to a service provider.

   It is a matter for individual Countries whether or not they will
   support (or require) information giving the identity of the current
   "owner" of an E.164 number within their responsibility to be made
   available via IRIS/Whois.  Thus it may not be possible to use these
   protocols to find out the entity responsible for a number or number
   range, particularly where that number or range is not currently "in
   use".

   For this reason, we propose that the VOID indication also includes a
   contact address (an email address or a web address) by which the
   authority responsible for this number (or range) can be contacted.

   This may not be the same entity as the one that maintains the DNS
   service for that "enclosing zone"; often the NRA will sub-contract a
   Registry Operator to maintain the DNS, but it is the NRA who is the
   authority for the E.164 number range, not that Registry Operator.

5.  ENUM Service Registration - VOID

   Enumservice Name: "VOID"

   Enumservice Type: "void"

   Enumservice Subtypes: "mailto", "http", "https"

   URI Schemes: "mailto:", "http:", "https:"

   Functional Specification: The proposed solution in Section 4.

   Definition of expected action:

      If a NAPTR with this Enumservice is received, it indicates that
      the queried E.164 number is currently unassigned to an end user
      for communications service.

      The recipient SHOULD treat this response as if they had received a
      "number not in service" indication from a terminating network.

      Note that, whatever subtype exists for this Enumservice, the
      generated URI is not a potential target for any current call.
      This contact (mailto:[5], http:[6], or https:[7]) MUST NOT be used
      in normal call processing but only if there is a non-call related
      reason to contact the number holder or authority.

   Security considerations: see Section 7.

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Authors

      Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny (for authors contact details see
      Authors' Addresses section).

   Any other information that the author deems interesting:

      There are three possible subtypes (each with an associated URI
      scheme).  In the first case, the subtype is "mailto" and has a
      generated URI scheme of "mailto:".  This can be used to hold an
      email address of the entity responsible for the unassigned number
      or number range (such as the NRA, or the Communications Service
      Provider or CSP to whom they have allocated a block of numbers, of
      which the current number is unused).

      The second case has a sub-type of "http" and has a generated URI
      scheme of "http:".  The last case has a sub-type of "https" and an

      associated generated URI scheme of "https:".  In both these, the
      URI can be used to indicate a web site holding information on the
      number (or number range) associated with the domain holding this
      NAPTR.  They differ only in whether or not the URL "points to" a
      web site using either a standard or TLS-secured connection.

6.  Examples

   1.  VOID:mailto

       $ORIGIN 0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
       3.8.0   NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+void:mailto"
       "!^.*$!mailto:num-drama-info@nra.foo!"

       This indicates that the controller of the number block
       +441632960xxx does not provide telephony service via the number
       +441632960083; it is not assigned to an end user.  Information on
       the status of this number may be obtainable by contacting the
       email address held in the regexp field.

   2.  VOID:http and VOID:https

       $ORIGIN 0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
       4.8.0   NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+void:http"
       "!^.*$!http:\/\/www.nra.foo\/drama-numbers\/index.html!"

       $ORIGIN 0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
       4.8.0   NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+void:https"
       "!^.*$!https:\/\/connect.nra.foo\/drama-numbers\/secure.html!"

       Both of these examples indicate that the controller of the number
       block +441632960xxx does not provide communication service via
       the number +441632960084; it is not assigned to an end user.
       Information on the status of this number may be obtained by
       making an HTTP connection to the web URL shown in the regexp
       field of the former example, or making a connection using TLS to
       the secure web URL held in the regexp field of the latter
       example.

7.  Security Considerations

   DNS does not make policy decisions about the records that it shares
   with an inquirer.  All DNS records must be assumed to be available to
   all inquirers at all times.  The information provided within an ENUM
   record set must therefore be considered to be open to the public.

   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS,
   and the applicability of DNSSEC [8] to these, is provided in [9].

   The specific issues applicable to this registration are:

   1.  by including an email address, the responsible authority is
       making this available globally.  They should expect that the
       published email address will be used to send unsolicited
       commercial email to them.

   2.  by publishing the email address, they expose the identity of the
       entity that has authority over this E.164 number (or range of
       numbers).  This may also be the case if a web URL is used.

   3.  by constructing a DNS response holding a VOID NAPTR, a third
       party could initiate a denial of service attack on the assignee
       of a number (or number range).  The recipient of a "spoofed"
       response would react by assuming that the associated E.164 number
       is not in service, so denying calls to that number.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests registration of the "void" Enumservice with
   three sub-types (void:mailto, void:http and void:https) according to
   the guidelines and specifications in RFC 3761 [3] and the definitions
   in this document.
