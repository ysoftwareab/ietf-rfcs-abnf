          1.  Status of this Memo

          This draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as an
          experimental extension to the SNMP MIB.  Distribution of this
          memo is unlimited.  Please send comments to the authors.


          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
          defines managed objects used for managing subnetworks which
          use the IEEE 802.5 Token Ring technology [11].  This memo does
          not specify a standard for the Internet community.

          3.  Historical Perspective

          As reported in RFC 1052, IAB Recommendations for the
          Development of Internet Network Management Standards [1], a
          two-prong strategy for network management of TCP/IP-based
          internets was undertaken.  In the short-term, the Simple
          Network Management Protocol (SNMP), defined in RFC 1067, was
          to be used to manage nodes in the Internet community.  In the
          long-term, the use of the OSI network management framework was
          to be examined.  Two documents were produced to define the
          management information: RFC 1065, which defined the Structure
          of Management Information (SMI), and RFC 1066, which defined
          the Management Information Base (MIB).  Both of these
          documents were designed so as to be compatible with both the
          SNMP and the OSI network management framework.

          This strategy was quite successful in the short-term:
          Internet-based network management technology was fielded, by
          both the research and commercial communities, within a few
          months.  As a result of this, portions of the Internet
          community became network manageable in a timely fashion.

          As reported in RFC 1109, Report of the Second Ad Hoc Network
          Management Review Group [2], the requirements of the SNMP and
          the OSI network management frameworks were more different than
          anticipated.  As such, the requirement for compatibility
          between the SMI/MIB and both frameworks was suspended.  This
          action permitted the operational network management framework,
          based on the SNMP, to respond to new operational needs in the
          Internet community by producing MIB-II.

          In May of 1990, the core documents were elevated to "Standard
          Protocols" with "Recommended" status.  As such, the Internet-
          standard network management framework consists of: Structure
          and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based
          internets, RFC 1155 [3], which describes how managed objects
          contained in the MIB are defined; Management Information Base
          for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets, which
          describes the managed objects contained in the MIB, RFC 1156
          [4]; and, the Simple Network Management Protocol, RFC 1157
          [5], which defines the protocol used to manage these objects.

          Consistent with the IAB directive to produce simple, workable
          systems in the short-term, the list of managed objects defined
          in the Internet-standard MIB was derived by taking only those

          Internet draft          IEEE 802.5 MIB            October 1990


          elements which are considered essential.  However, the SMI
          defined three extensibility mechanisms: one, the addition of
          new standard objects through the definitions of new versions
          of the MIB; two, the addition of widely-available but non-
          standard objects through the experimental subtree; and three,
          the addition of private objects through the enterprises
          subtree.  Such additional objects can not only be used for
          vendor-specific elements, but also for experimentation as
          required to further the knowledge of which other objects are
          essential.

          This memo defines extensions to the MIB using the second
          method.  It contains definitions of managed objects used for
          experimentation.

          4.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
          refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [3]
          purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
          These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.

          The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1
          [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the
          SNMP.


          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains contains the specification of all object
          types contained in this MIB module.  The object types are
          defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended
          by the extensions specified in [9,10].

          5.  Overview

          This memo defines three tables: the 802.5 Interface Table,
          which contains state and parameter information which is
          specific to 802.5 interfaces, the 802.5 Statistics Table,
          which contains 802.5 interface statistics, and the 802.5 Timer
          Table, which contains the values of 802.5-defined timers. A
          managed system will have one entry in the 802.5 Interface
          Table and one entry in the 802.5 Statistics Table for each of
          its 802.5 interfaces.  Implementation of the 802.5 Timer Table
          is optional.

          This memo also defines OBJECT IDENTIFIERs, some to identify
          802.5 tests, for use with the ifExtnsTestTable defined in
          [12], and some to identify Token Ring interface Chip Sets, for
          use with the ifExtnsChipSet object defined in [12].

          5.1.  Scope of Definitions

          All objects defined in this memo are registered in a single
          subtree within the experimental namespace [3], and are for use
          with every interface which conforms to the IEEE 802.5 Token
          Ring Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications [11].  At
          present, this applies to interfaces for which the ifType
          variable in the Internet-standard MIB [4,6] has the value:

               iso88025-tokenRing(9)

          For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in
          the MIB-II [6] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

               dot5    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { experimental 4 }

          as defined below.

          5.2.  Textual Conventions

          A new datatype, MacAddress, is introduced as a textual
          convention in this document.  This textual convention has NO
          effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed
          object. Objects defined using this convention are always
          encoded by means of the rules that define their primitive
          type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary
          to accommodate this textual convention which is adopted merely
          for the convenience of readers.
