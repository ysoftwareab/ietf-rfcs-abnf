 1. Abstract 
    
   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) has been developed as part of the 
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocol suite to manage Traffic 
   Engineering (TE) links. The GMPLS control plane (routing and 
   signaling) uses TE links for establishing Label Switched Paths 
   (LSPs). This memo describes the relationship of the LMP procedures 
   to Êdiscovery∆ as defined in the International Telecommunication 
   Union (ITU), i.e. G.8080, G.7714, and G.7714.1, and on-going ITU-T 
   work. This document provides an overview of LMP in the context of 
   the ITU-T Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON) [G.8080] 
   and transport network [G.805] terminology and relates it to the ITU-

 4. Introduction 
    
   The GMPLS control plane consists of several building blocks as 
   described in [GMPLS-ARCH]. The building blocks include signaling, 
   routing, and link management for establishing LSPs. For scalability 
   purposes, multiple physical resources can be combined to form a 
   single traffic engineering (TE) link for the purposes of path 
   computation by Constrained SPF and by GMPLS control plane signaling. 
   As manual provisioning and management of these links is impractical, 
   LMP was specified to manage TE links. Two mandatory management 
   capabilities of LMP are control channel management and TE link 
   property correlation. Additional optional capabilities include 
   verifying physical connectivity and fault management. LMP [LMP] 
   defines the messages and procedures for GMPLS TE link management.  
   [LMP-TEST] defines SONET/SDH specific messages and procedures for 
   link verification. 
    
   G.8080 Amendment 1 defines control plane discovery as two separate 
   processes, one process occurs within the transport plane space and 
   the other process occurs within the control plane space. The ITU-T 
   has developed Recommendation G.7714 ∆Generalized automatic discovery 
   techniques∆ defining the functional processes and information 
   exchange related to transport plane discovery aspects: i.e., layer 
   adjacency discovery and physical media adjacency discovery. Specific 
   methods and protocols are not defined in [G.7714].  ITU-T 
   Recommendation G.7714.1 ÊProtocol for automatic discovery in SDH and 
   OTN networks∆ defines a protocol and procedure for transport plane 
   layer adjacency discovery (e.g. discovering the transport plane 
   layer end point relationships and verifying their connectivity). The 
   ITU-T is currently working to extend discovery to control plane 
   aspects including defining a Recommendation on framework 
   architecture for discovery and a Recommendation on ∆Control plane 
   initial establishment, reconfiguration. 
    
 5. Transport Network Architecture 
    
   A generic functional architecture for transport networks is defined 
   in the ITU-T Recommendation G.805.  This recommendation describes 
   the functional architecture of transport networks in a technology 
   independent way.  This architecture forms the basis for a set of 
   technology specific architectural recommendations for transport 
   networks (e.g., SDH, PDH, OTN, etc.) 
    
   The architecture defined in G.805 is designed using a layered model 
   with a client-server relationship between layers.  The architecture 
   is recursive in nature; a network layer is both a server to the 
   client layer above it and a client to the server layer below it.

   There are two basic building blocks defined in G.805: ∆subnetworksÊ 
   and ∆links∆.  A subnetwork is defined as a set of ports which are 
   available for the purpose of routing ∆characteristic informationÊ. A 
   link consists of a subset of ports at the edge of one subnetwork (or 
   ∆access group∆) and is associated with a corresponding subset of 
   ports at the edge of another subnetwork or access group. 
    
   Two types of connections are defined in G.805: ∆link connection∆ 
   (LC) and ∆subnetwork connection∆ (SNC). A link connection is a fixed 
   and inflexible connection, while a subnetwork connection is flexible 
   and is setup and released using management or control plane 
   procedures. A network connection is defined as a concatenation of 
   subnetwork and link connections. Figure 1 illustrates link and 
   subnetwork connections.

   G.805 defines a set of reference points for the purpose of 
   identification in both the management and the control plane.  These 
   identifiers are NOT required to be the same.  A link connection or a 
   subnetwork connection is delimited by connection points (CP). A 
   network connection is delimited by a termination connection point 
   (TCP). A link connection in the client layer is represented by a 
   pair of adaptation functions and a trail in the server layer 
   network. A trail represents the transfer of monitored adapted 
   characteristics information of the client layer network between 
   access points (AP). A trail is delimited by two access points, one 
   at each end of the trail. Figure 2 shows a network connection and 
   its relationship with link and subnetwork connections. Figure 2 also 
   shows the CP and TCP reference points.

   For management plane purpose, the G.805 reference points are 
   represented by a set of management objects described in ITU 
   recommendation M.3100. Connection termination points (CTP) and trail 
   termination points (TTP) are the management plane objects for CP and 
   TCP respectively.  
    
   In the same way as in M.3100, the transport resources in G.805 are 
   identified for the purpose of control plane by entities suitable for 
   connection control. G.8080 introduces the reference architecture for 
   the control plane of the automatic switched optical networks (ASON). 
   G.8080 introduces a set of reference points relevant to the ASON 
   control plane and their relationship to the corresponding points in 
   the transport plane. A subnetwork point (SNP) is an abstraction that 
   represents an actual or potential underlying CP or an actual or 
   potential TCP. A set of SNPs that are grouped together for the 
   purpose of routing is called SNP pool (SNPP). Similar to LC and SNC, 
   the SNP-SNP relationship may be static and inflexible (this is 
   referred to as SNP link connection) or it can be dynamic and 
   flexible (this is referred to as SNP subnetwork connection). 
    
    
 6. G.8080 Discovery Framework 
    
   G.8080 provides a reference control plane architecture based on the 
   descriptive use of functional components representing abstract 
   entities and abstract component interfaces. The description is 
   generic and no particular physical partitioning of functions is 
   implied. The input/output information flows associated with the 
   functional components serve for defining the functions of the 
   components and are considered to be conceptual, not physical. 
   Components can be combined in different ways and the description is 
   not intended to limit implementations. Control plane discovery is 
   described in G.8080 by using three components: Discovery Agent (DA), 
   Termination and adaptation performer (TAP), and Link Resource 
   Manager (LRM).  
    
   The objective of the discovery framework in G.8080 is to establish 
   the relationship between CP-CP link connections (transport plane) 
   and SNP-SNP link connections (control plane). The fundamental 
   characteristics of G.8080 discovery framework is the separation 
   between the control and the transport plane name spaces. The 
   separation between the two name spaces has the advantage that the

   discovery of the transport plane can be performed independent from 
   that of the control plane (and vise-versa) of the other, and 
   independent of the method used in each name space. This allows 
   assigning link connections in the control plane without the link 
   connection being physically connected.  
    
   Discovery encompasses two separate processes: transport plane 
   discovery, i.e. CP-to-CP and TCP-to-TCP connectivity and (2) control 
   plane discovery, i.e. SNP-to-SNP and SNPP-to-SNPP links. 
    
   G.8080 Amendment 1 defines the discovery agent (DA) as the entity 
   responsible for the discovery in the transport plane. The DA 
   operates in the transport name space only and provides the 
   separation between that space and the control plane names. A local 
   DA is only aware of the CPs and TCPs that are assigned to it. The DA 
   holds the CP-CP link connection in the transport plane to enable 
   SNP-SNP link connections to be bound to them at a later time. The 
   CP-CP relationship may be discovered (e.g. per G.7714.1) or provided 
   by a management system. 
    
   Control plane discovery takes place entirely within the control 
   plane name space (SNPs). The Link Resource Manager (LRM) holds the 
   SNP-SNP binding information necessary for the control plane name of 
   the link connection, while the termination adaptation performer 
   (TAP) holds the relation between the control plane name (SNP) and 
   the transport plane name (CP) of the resource. Figure 3 shows the 
   relationship and the different entities for transport and control 
   discoveries.

   A discovery process may then validate the resulting SNP link 
   connections. The degree of validation required is dependent on the 
   integrity of the relationships initially provided by the transport 
   plane (or management plane), and the integrity of the process used 
   to map CTPs to SNPs. Specific information that needs to be 
   exchanged, and specific protocol procedures for SNP and SNPP link 
   association and validation have not been specified yet in ITU-T. 
    
 7. LMP and G8080 Discovery 
    
 7.1 LMP and G.8080 Terminology Mapping 
    
   GMPLS is a set of IP-based protocols, including LMP, providing a 
   control plane for multiple data plane technologies, including 
   optical/transport networks and their resources (i.e. wavelengths, 
   timeslots, etc.) and without assuming any restriction on the control 
   plane architecture (see [GMPLS-ARCH]). Whereas, G.8080 defines a 
   control plane reference architecture for optical/ transport 
   networks. Being developed in separate standards forums, and with 
   different scope, they use different terms and definitions. 

   Terminology mapping between LMP and ASON (G.805/G.8080) is an 
   important step towards the understanding of the two architectures 
   and allows for potential cooperation in areas where cooperation is 
   possible. To facilitate this mapping, we differentiate between the 
   two types of data links in LMP. According to LMP, a data link may be 
   considered by each node that it terminates on as either a Êport∆ or 
   a Êcomponent link∆. The LMP notions of port and component link are 
   supported by the G.805/G.8080 architecture. G.8080 refers to a 
   component link as a variable adaptation function i.e. a single 
   server layer trail dynamically supporting different multiplexing 
   structures. Note that when the data plane delivers its own 
   addressing space, LMP Interface_IDs and Data Links IDs are used as 
   handlers by the control plane to the actual CP Name and CP-to-CP 
   Name, respectively. 

   The terminology mapping is summarized in the following table: 
   +----------------+------------------+----------------+ 
   | ASON Terms     | GMPLS/LMP Terms  | GMPLS/LMP Terms|

.2 LMP and G.8080 Discovery Relationship 
    
    
    
   LMP currently consists of four primary procedures, of which, the 
   first two are mandatory and the last two are optional:  
        
         1.  Control channel management  
         2.  Link property correlation  
         3.  Link verification  
         4.  Fault management  
     
   LMP procedures that are relevant to G.8080 control plane discovery 
   are control channel maintenance and link property correlation. Key 
   to understanding G.8080 discovery aspects in relation to LMP is that 
   LMP procedures are specific for an IP-based control plane 
   abstraction of the transport plane. 
    
   LMP control channel management is used to establish and maintain 
   control channel connectivity between LMP adjacent nodes. In GMPLS, 
   the control channels between two adjacent nodes are not required to 
   use the same physical medium as the TE links between those nodes. 
   The control channels that are used to exchange the GMPLS control-
   plane information exist independently of the TE links they manage 
   (i.e., control channels may be in-band or out-of-band, provided the 
   associated control points terminate the LMP packets). The Link 
   Management Protocol (LMP) was designed to manage TE links, 
   independently of the physical medium capabilities of the data links. 
   This is done using a Config message exchange followed by a 
   lightweight keep-alive message exchange.

   Link property correlation is used to aggregate multiple data links 
   into a single TE Link and to synchronize the link properties. 
    
   Link verification is used to verify the physical connectivity of the 
   data links and verify the mapping of the Interface-ID to Link-ID (CP 
   to SNP). The Local to Remote associations can be obtained using a 
   priori knowledge or using the Link verification procedure.  
    
   Fault management is primarily used to suppress alarms and to 
   localize failures. It is an optional LMP procedure, it∆s use will 
   depend on the specific technology∆s capabilities. 
    
    
   LMP supports distinct transport and control plane name spaces with 
   the (out-of-band) TRACE object (see [LMP-TEST]).  The LMP TRACE 
   object allows transport plane names to be associated with interface 
   identifiers [LMP-TEST]. 
    
   Aspects of LMP link verification appear similar to G.7714.1 
   discovery, however the two procedures are different. G.7714.1 
   provides discovery of the transport plane layer adjacencies. It 
   provides a generic procedure to discover the connectivity of two end 
   points in the transport plane. Whereas, LMP link verification 
   procedure is a control plane driven procedure and assumes either (1) 
   a priori knowledge of the associated data plane∆s local and remote 
   end point connectivity and Interface_IDs (e.g. via management plane 
   or use of G.7714.1), or (2) support of the remote node for 
   associating the data interface being verified with the content of 
   the TRACE object (inferred mapping). For SONET/SDH transport 
   networks, LMP verification uses SONET/SDH Trail Trace identifier 
   (see G.783). 
    
   As G.7714.1 supports the use of transport plane discovery 
   independent of the platform providing the capability. Furthermore 
   G.7714.1 it supports use of a Discovery Agent located in an external 
   system and the use of text-oriented man-machine language to provide 
   the interface. Therefore, G.7714.1 limits the discovery messages to 
   printable characters defined by T.50 and requires Base64 encoding 
   for the TCP-ID and DA ID. External name-servers may be used to 
   resolve the G.7714.1 TCP name. Whereas, LMP is based on the use of 
   an IP-based control plane, and the LMP interface ID uses IPv4, IPv6, 
   or unnumbered interface IDs (no encoding restrictions). 
    
   In summary, comparing the LMP link verification with G.8080, LMP 
   link verification process is in the G.8080 control plane discovery 
   space, e.g. SNP link validation as described in 6.3/G.8080. And 
   analogous to the description in G.8080, it is optional, dependent on 
   the degree of validation required for an operator∆s use scenario.
