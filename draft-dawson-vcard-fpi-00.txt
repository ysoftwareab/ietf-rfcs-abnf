Abstract

   The IETF has defined a standard format for electronic business card
   data, called vCard. This format is useful for exchange of personal
   directory data across the Internet, as well as in non-Internet
   environments.

   In a number of environments where the vCard will be used, the format
   type and version needs to be identified. For example, when
   registering the vCard as a format for memory-based "clipboard" or
   "drag/drop" user interface interactions. For these cases, a
   definitive formal public identifier (FPI) for the vCard will be
   required. This memo defined the FPI to be used when referring to the
   version 3.0 of the vCard format.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC 2119].

1.      Introduction

   This memo defines a FPI for the version 3.0 vCard. An FPI is a
   identifier that is used to uniquely identify an entity. The syntax
   for a FPI is defined in [ISO 9070].

Internet Draft    vCard v3.0 Formal Public Identifier      July 1, 1998


   The FPI defined by this memo can be used to register the version 3.0
   of the vCard format in an operating system object registry so that
   the format can be uniquely referenced within that environment. In
   addition, this FPI can be used to refer to the vCard notation in
   representation grammars, such as that defined by [XML].

2.      vCard v3.0 FPI

   The public identified defined by this memo is a non-registered FPI,
   as defined by [ISO 9070]. The FPI is defined by the following text
   string.

        "-//IETF//NONSGML vCard version 3.0//EN"

   This FPI SHOULD be used whereever a reference is needed to the
   version 3.0 vCard format.

3.      Security Considerations

   Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
