             Media Types for Sensor Markup Language (SenML)
                      draft-jennings-core-senml-06

Abstract

   This specification defines media types for representing simple sensor
   measurements and device parameters in the Sensor Markup Language
   (SenML).  Representations are defined in JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON), Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), eXtensible
   Markup Language (XML), and Efficient XML Interchange (EXI), which
   share the common SenML data model.  A simple sensor, such as a
   temperature sensor, could use this media type in protocols such as
   HTTP or CoAP to transport the measurements of the sensor or to be
   configured.

Internet-Draft                Sensor Markup                   April 2016


1.  Overview

   Connecting sensors to the internet is not new, and there have been
   many protocols designed to facilitate it.  This specification defines
   new media types for carrying simple sensor information in a protocol
   such as HTTP or CoAP called the Sensor Markup Language (SenML).  This
   format was designed so that processors with very limited capabilities
   could easily encode a sensor measurement into the media type, while
   at the same time a server parsing the data could relatively
   efficiently collect a large number of sensor measurements.  The
   markup language can be used for a variety of data flow models, most
   notably data feeds pushed from a sensor to a collector, and the web
   resource model where the sensor is requested as a resource
   representation (e.g., "GET /sensor/temperature").

   There are many types of more complex measurements and measurements
   that this media type would not be suitable for.  SenML strikes a
   balance between having some information about the sensor carried with
   the sensor data so that the data is self describing but it also tries
   to make that a fairly minimal set of auxiliary information for
   efficiency reason.  Other information about the sensor can be
   discovered by other methods such as using the CoRE Link Format
   [RFC6690].

   SenML is defined by a data model for measurements and simple meta-
   data about measurements and devices.  The data is structured as a
   single array that contains a series of SenML Records which can each
   contain attributes such as an unique identifier for the sensor, the
   time the measurement was made, the unit the measurement is in, and
   the current value of the sensor.  Serializations for this data model
   are defined for JSON [RFC7159], CBOR [RFC7049], XML, and Efficient
   XML Interchange (EXI) [W3C.REC-exi-20110310].

   For example, the following shows a measurement from a temperature
   gauge encoded in the JSON syntax.

   [{ "n": "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063", "v":23.1, "u":"Cel" }]

   In the example above, the array has a single SenML Record with a
   measurement for a sensor named "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063" with a
   current value of 23.5 degrees Celsius.

2.  Requirements and Design Goals

   The design goal is to be able to send simple sensor measurements in
   small packets on mesh networks from large numbers of constrained
   devices.  Keeping the total size of payload under 80 bytes makes this
   easy to use on a wireless mesh network.  It is always difficult to

   define what small code is, but there is a desire to be able to
   implement this in roughly 1 KB of flash on a 8 bit microprocessor.
   Experience with Google power meter and large scale deployments has
   indicated that the solution needs to support allowing multiple
   measurements to be batched into a single HTTP or CoAP request.  This
   "batch" upload capability allows the server side to efficiently
   support a large number of devices.  It also conveniently supports
   batch transfers from proxies and storage devices, even in situations
   where the sensor itself sends just a single data item at a time.  The
   multiple measurements could be from multiple related sensors or from
   the same sensor but at different times.

   The basic design is an array with a series of measurements.  The
   following example shows two measurements made at different times.
   The value of a measurement is in the "v" tag, the time of a
   measurement is in the "t" tag, the "n" tag has a unique sensor name,
   and the unit of the measurement is carried in the "u" tag.

   [
       { "n": "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063",
         "t": 1276020076, "v":23.5, "u":"Cel" },
       { "n": "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063",
         "t": 1276020091, "v":23.6, "u":"Cel" }
   ]

   To keep the messages small, it does not make sense to repeat the "n"
   tag in each SenML Record so there is a concept of a Base Name which
   is simply a string that is prepended to the Name field of all
   elements in that record and any records that follow it.  So a more
   compact form of the example above is the following.

   [
       { "bn": "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063",
         "t": 1276020076, "v":23.5, "u":"Cel" },
       {  "t": 1276020091, "v":23.6, "u":"Cel" }
   ]

   In the above example the Base Name is in the "bn" tag and the "n"
   tags in each Record are the empty string so they are omitted.  The
   Base Name also could be put in a separate Record such as in the
   following example.

   [
       { "bn": "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063" },
       { "t": 1276020076, "v":23.5, "u":"Cel" },
       { "t": 1276020091, "v":23.6, "u":"Cel" }
   ]

   Some devices have accurate time while others do not so SenML supports
   absolute and relative times.  Time is represented in floating point
   as seconds and values greater than zero represent an absolute time
   relative to the unix epoch while values of 0 or less represent a
   relative time in the past from the current time.  A simple sensor
   with no absolute wall clock time might take a measurement every
   second and batch up 60 of them then send it to a server.  It would
   include the relative time the measurement was made to the time the
   batch was send in the SenML Pack.  The server might have accurate NTP
   time and use the time it received the data, and the relative offset,
   to replace the times in the SenML with absolute times before saving
   the SenML Pack in a document database.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This document also uses the following terms:

   SenML Record:  One measurement or configuration instance in time
      presented using the SenML data model.

   SenML Pack:  One or more SenML Records in an array structure.

4.  Semantics

   Each SenML Pack carries a single array that represents a set of
   measurements and/or parameters.  This array contains a series of
   objects with several optional attributes described below:

   Base Name:  This is a string that is prepended to the names found in
      the entries.  This attribute is optional.  This applies to the
      entries in all Records.  A Base Name can only be included in the
      first Record of the array.

   Base Time:  A base time that is added to the time found in an entry.
      This attribute is optional.  This applies to the entries in all
      Records.  A Base Time can only be included in the first Record of
      the array.

   Base Unit:  A base unit that is assumed for all entries, unless
      otherwise indicated.  This attribute is optional.  If a record
      does not contain a unit value, then the base unit is used
      otherwise the value of found in the Unit is used.  This applies to

Internet-Draft                Sensor Markup                   April 2016


      the entries in all Records.  A Base Unit can only be included in
      the first object of the array.

   Base Value:  A base value is added to the value found in an entry,
      similar to Base Time.  This attribute is optional.  This applies
      to the entries in all Records.  A Base Value can only be included
      in the first Record of the array.

   Version:  Version number of media type format.  This attribute is
      optional positive integer and defaults to 5 if not present.  A
      Version can only be included in the first object of the array.

   Name:  Name of the sensor or parameter.  When appended to the Base
      Name attribute, this must result in a globally unique identifier
      for the resource.  The name is optional, if the Base Name is
      present.  If the name is missing, Base Name must uniquely identify
      the resource.  This can be used to represent a large array of
      measurements from the same sensor without having to repeat its
      identifier on every measurement.

   Unit:  Units for a measurement value.  Optional.  If the Record has
      not Unit, the Base Unit is used as the Unit.  Having no Unit and
      no Base Unit is allowed.

   Value  Value of the entry.  Optional if a Sum value is present,
      otherwise required.  Values are represented using three basic data
      types, Floating point numbers ("v" field for "Value"), Booleans
      ("vb" for "Boolean Value"), Strings ("vs" for "String Value") and
      Data ("vd" for "Binary Data Value") .  Exactly one of these three
      fields MUST appear unless there is Sum field in which case it is
      allowed to have no Value field or to have "v" field.

   Sum:  Integrated sum of the values over time.  Optional.  This
      attribute is in the units specified in the Unit value multiplied
      by seconds.

   Time:  Time when value was recorded.  Optional.

   Update Time:  An optional time in seconds that represents the maximum
      time before this sensor will provide an updated reading for a
      measurement.  This can be used to detect the failure of sensors or
      communications path from the sensor.

   The SenML format can be extended with further custom attributes.
   TODO - describe what extensions are possible and how to do them.

   Systems reading one of the objects MUST check for the Version
   attribute.  If this value is a version number larger than the version

Internet-Draft                Sensor Markup                   April 2016


   which the system understands, the system SHOULD NOT use this object.
   This allows the version number to indicate that the object contains
   mandatory to understand attributes.  New version numbers can only be
   defined in an RFC that updates this specification or it successors.

   The Name value is concatenated to the Base Name value to get the name
   of the sensor.  The resulting name needs to uniquely identify and
   differentiate the sensor from all others.  If the object is a
   representation resulting from the request of a URI [RFC3986], then in
   the absence of the Base Name attribute, this URI is used as the
   default value of Base Name.  Thus in this case the Name field needs
   to be unique for that URI, for example an index or subresource name
   of sensors handled by the URI.

   Alternatively, for objects not related to a URI, a unique name is
   required.  In any case, it is RECOMMENDED that the full names are
   represented as URIs or URNs [RFC2141].  One way to create a unique
   name is to include some bit string that has guaranteed uniqueness
   (such as a 1-wire address) that is assigned to the device.  Some of
   the examples in this draft use the device URN type as specified in
   [I-D.arkko-core-dev-urn].  UUIDs [RFC4122] are another way to
   generate a unique name.  Note that long-term stable unique
   identifiers are problematic for privacy reasons [RFC7721] and should
   be used with care or avoided.

   The resulting concatenated name MUST consist only of characters out
   of the set "A" to "Z", "a" to "z", "0" to "9", "-", ":", ".", or "_"
   and it MUST start with a character out of the set "A" to "Z", "a" to
   "z", or "0" to "9".  This restricted character set was chosen so that
   these names can be directly used as in other types of URI including
   segments of an HTTP path with no special encoding and can be directly
   used in many databases and analytic systems.  [RFC5952] contains
   advice on encoding an IPv6 address in a name.

   If either the Base Time or Time value is missing, the missing
   attribute is considered to have a value of zero.  The Base Time and
   Time values are added together to get the time of measurement.  A
   time of zero indicates that the sensor does not know the absolute
   time and the measurement was made roughly "now".  A negative value is
   used to indicate seconds in the past from roughly "now".  A positive
   value is used to indicate the number of seconds, excluding leap
   seconds, since the start of the year 1970 in UTC.

   Representing the statistical characteristics of measurements, such as
   accuracy, can be very complex.  Future specification may add new
   attributes to provide better information about the statistical
   properties of the measurement.

5.  Associating Meta-data

   SenML is designed to carry the minimum dynamic information about
   measurements, and for efficiency reasons does not carry significant
   static meta-data about the device, object or sensors.  Instead, it is
   assumed that this meta-data is carried out of band.  For web
   resources using SenML Packs, this meta-data can be made available
   using the CoRE Link Format [RFC6690].  The most obvious use of this
   link format is to describe that a resource is available in a SenML
   format in the first place.  The relevant media type indicator is
   included in the Content-Type (ct=) attribute.

   The root content consists of an array with JSON objects for each
   SenML Record.  All the fields in the above table MAY occur in the
   records with the type specified in the table.

   Only the UTF-8 form of JSON is allowed.  Characters in the String
   Value are encoded using the escape sequences defined in [RFC4627].
   Characters in the Data Value are base64 encoded with URL safe

   Systems receiving measurements MUST be able to process the range of
   floating point numbers that are representable as an IEEE double-
   precision floating-point numbers [IEEE.754.1985].  The number of
   significant digits in any measurement is not relevant, so a reading

   of 1.1 has exactly the same semantic meaning as 1.10.  If the value
   has an exponent, the "e" MUST be in lower case.  The mantissa SHOULD
   be less than 19 characters long and the exponent SHOULD be less than
   5 characters long.  This allows time values to have better than micro
   second precision over the next 100 years.

   Note that in some usage scenarios of SenML the implementations MAY
   store or transmit SenML in a stream-like fashion, where data is
   collected over time and continuously added to the object.  This mode
   of operation is optional, but systems or protocols using SenML in
   this fashion MUST specify that they are doing this.  SenML defines a
   separate mime type (TODO) to indicate Sensor Streaming Markup
   Language (SensML) for this usage.  In this situation the SensML
   stream can be sent and received in a partial fashion, i.e., a
   measurement entry can be read as soon as the SenML Record is received
   and not have to wait for the full SensML Stream to be complete.

   For instance, the following stream of measurements may be sent via a
   long lived HTTP POST from the producer of a SensML to the consumer of
   that, and each measurement object may be reported at the time it
   measured:

   [ {"bn": "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063",
     "bt": 1320067464,

6.1.3.  Multiple Measurements

   The following example shows humidity measurements from a mobile
   device with an IPv6 address 2001:db8::1, starting at Mon Oct 31
   13:24:24 UTC 2011.  The device also provides position data, which is
   provided in the same measurement or parameter array as separate
   entries.  Note time is used to for correlating data that belongs
   together, e.g., a measurement and a parameter associated with it.
   Finally, the device also reports extra data about its battery status
   at a separate time.

6.1.4.  Collection of Resources

   The following example shows how to query one device that can provide
   multiple measurements.  The example assumes that a client has fetched
   information from a device at 2001:db8::2 by performing a GET
   operation on http://[2001:db8::2] at Mon Oct 31 16:27:09 UTC 2011,
   and has gotten two separate values as a result, a temperature and
   humidity measurement.

7.  CBOR Representation (application/senml+cbor)

   The CBOR [RFC7049] representation is equivalent to the JSON
   representation, with the following changes:

   o  For compactness, the CBOR representation uses integers for the map
      keys defined in Table 2.  This table is conclusive, i.e., there is
      no intention to define any additional integer map keys; any
      extensions will use string map keys.

   o  For JSON Numbers, the CBOR representation can use integers,
      floating point numbers, or decimal fractions (CBOR Tag 4); the
      common limitations of JSON implementations are not relevant for
      these.  For the version number, however, only an unsigned integer
      is allowed.

8.  XML Representation (application/senml+xml)

   A SenML Stream can also be represented in XML format as defined in
   this section.  The following example shows an XML example for the
   same sensor measurement as in Section 6.1.2.

   <sensml xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:senml">
     <senml bn="urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063/" bt="1.276020076e+09"
     bu="A" bver="5"></senml>
     <senml n="voltage" u="V" v="120.1"></senml>
     <senml n="current" t="-5" v="1.2"></senml>
     <senml n="current" t="-4" v="1.3"></senml>
     <senml n="current" t="-3" v="1.4"></senml>
     <senml n="current" t="-2" v="1.5"></senml>
     <senml n="current" t="-1" v="1.6"></senml>
     <senml n="current" v="1.7"></senml>
   </sensml>

   The SenML Stream is represented as a sensml tag that contains a
   series of senml tags for each SenML Record.  The SenML Fields are
   represents as XML attributes.  The following table shows the mapping
   the SenML Field names to the attribute used in the XML senml tag.

9.  EXI Representation (application/senml-exi)

   For efficient transmission of SenML over e.g. a constrained network,
   Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) can be used.  This encodes the XML
   Schema structure of SenML into binary tags and values rather than
   ASCII text.  An EXI representation of SenML SHOULD be made using the
   strict schema-mode of EXI.  This mode however does not allow tag
   extensions to the schema, and therefore any extensions will be lost
   in the encoding.  For uses where extensions need to be preserved in
   EXI, the non-strict schema mode of EXI MAY be used.

   The EXI header option MUST be included.  An EXI schemaID options MUST
   be set to the value of "a" indicating the scheme provided in this
   specification.  Future revisions to the schema can change this
   schemaID to allow for backwards compatibility.  When the data will be
   transported over CoAP or HTTP, an EXI Cookie SHOULD NOT be used as it
   simply makes things larger and is redundant to information provided
   in the Content-Type header.

   TODO - examples probably have the wrong setting the schemaID

   The following is the XSD Schema to be used for strict schema guided
   EXI processing.  It is generated from the RelaxNG.

   The above example used the bit packed form of EXI but it is also
   possible to use a byte packed form of EXI which can makes it easier
   for a simple sensor to produce valid EXI without really implementing
   EXI.  Consider the example of a temperature sensor that produces a
   value in tenths of degrees Celsius over a range of 0.0 to 55.0.  It
   would produce an XML SenML file such as:

   <sensml xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:senml">
     <senml n="urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063" u="Cel" v="23.1"></senml>
   </sensml>

   The compressed form, using the byte alignment option of EXI, for the
   above XML is the following:

 0000 a0 00 48 82 0e 6c ad cd ad 86 a5 cc ec ad c5 cf |..H..l..........|
 0010 0e 6c 80 02 05 1d 75 72 6e 3a 64 65 76 3a 6f 77 |.l....urn:dev:ow|
 0020 3a 31 30 65 32 30 37 33 61 30 31 30 38 30 30 36 |:10e2073a0108006|
 0030 33 02 05 43 65 6c 01 00 e7 01 01 00 04 01       |3..Cel........|
 003e

   A small temperature sensor devices that only generates this one EXI
   file does not really need an full EXI implementation.  It can simple
   hard code the output replacing the one wire device ID starting at
   byte 0x16 and going to byte 0x31 with it's device ID, and replacing
   the value "0xe7 0x01" at location 0x38 to 0x39 with the current
   temperature.  The EXI Specification [W3C.REC-exi-20110310] contains
   the full information 'on how floating point numbers are represented,
   but for the purpose of this sensor, the temperature can be converted
   to an integer in tenths of degrees (231 in this example).  EXI stores
   7 bits of the integer in each byte with the top bit set to one if
   there are further bytes.  So the first bytes at is set to low 7 bits
   of the integer temperature in tenths of degrees plus 0x80.  In this
   example 231 & 0x7F + 0x80 = 0xE7.  The second byte is set to the

   integer temperature in tenths of degrees right shifted 7 bits.  In
   this example 231 >> 7 = 0x01.

10.  Usage Considerations

   The measurements support sending both the current value of a sensor
   as well as the an integrated sum.  For many types of measurements,
   the sum is more useful than the current value.  For example, an
   electrical meter that measures the energy a given computer uses will
   typically want to measure the cumulative amount of energy used.  This
   is less prone to error than reporting the power each second and
   trying to have something on the server side sum together all the
   power measurements.  If the network between the sensor and the meter
   goes down over some period of time, when it comes back up, the
   cumulative sum helps reflect what happened while the network was
   down.  A meter like this would typically report a measurement with
   the units set to watts, but it would put the sum of energy used in
   the "s" attribute of the measurement.  It might optionally include
   the current power in the "v" attribute.

   While the benefit of using the integrated sum is fairly clear for
   measurements like power and energy, it is less obvious for something
   like temperature.  Reporting the sum of the temperature makes it easy
   to compute averages even when the individual temperature values are
   not reported frequently enough to compute accurate averages.
   Implementors are encouraged to report the cumulative sum as well as
   the raw value of a given sensor.

   Applications that use the cumulative sum values need to understand
   they are very loosely defined by this specification, and depending on
   the particular sensor implementation may behave in unexpected ways.
   Applications should be able to deal with the following issues:

   1.  Many sensors will allow the cumulative sums to "wrap" back to
       zero after the value gets sufficiently large.

   2.  Some sensors will reset the cumulative sum back to zero when the
       device is reset, loses power, or is replaced with a different
       sensor.

   3.  Applications cannot make assumptions about when the device
       started accumulating values into the sum.

   Typically applications can make some assumptions about specific
   sensors that will allow them to deal with these problems.  A common
   assumption is that for sensors whose measurement values are always
   positive, the sum should never get smaller; so if the sum does get

   smaller, the application will know that one of the situations listed
   above has happened.

   For reference, the CBOR representation can be described with the CDDL

   Note to RFC Editor: Please replace all occurrences of "RFC-AAAA" with

12.1.  Units Registry

   IANA will create a registry of SenML unit symbols.  The primary
   purpose of this registry is to make sure that symbols uniquely map to
   give type of measurement.  Definitions for many of these units can be
   found in location such as [NIST811] and [BIPM].

   o  Note 2: Assumed to be in WGS84 unless another reference frame is
      known for the sensor.

   New entries can be added to the registration by either Expert Review
   or IESG Approval as defined in [RFC5226].  Experts should exercise
   their own good judgment but need to consider the following
   guidelines:

   1.   There needs to be a real and compelling use for any new unit to
        be added.

   2.   Units should define the semantic information and be chosen
        carefully.  Implementors need to remember that the same word may
        be used in different real-life contexts.  For example, degrees
        when measuring latitude have no semantic relation to degrees
        when measuring temperature; thus two different units are needed.

   3.   These measurements are produced by computers for consumption by
        computers.  The principle is that conversion has to be easily be
        done when both reading and writing the media type.  The value of
        a single canonical representation outweighs the convenience of
        easy human representations or loss of precision in a conversion.

   4.   Use of SI prefixes such as "k" before the unit is not allowed.
        Instead one can represent the value using scientific notation
        such a 1.2e3.  TODO - Open Issue.  Some people would like to
        have SI prefixes to improve human readability.

   5.   For a given type of measurement, there will only be one unit
        type defined.  So for length, meters are defined and other
        lengths such as mile, foot, light year are not allowed.  For
        most cases, the SI unit is preferred.

   6.   Symbol names that could be easily confused with existing common
        units or units combined with prefixes should be avoided.  For
        example, selecting a unit name of "mph" to indicate something
        that had nothing to do with velocity would be a bad choice, as
        "mph" is commonly used to mean miles per hour.

   7.   The following should not be used because the are common SI
        prefixes: Y, Z, E, P, T, G, M, k, h, da, d, c, n, u, p, f, a, z,
        y, Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi, Ei, Zi, Yi.

   8.   The following units should not be used as they are commonly used
        to represent other measurements Ky, Gal, dyn, etg, P, St, Mx, G,
        Oe, Gb, sb, Lmb, ph, Ci, R, RAD, REM, gal, bbl, qt, degF, Cal,
        BTU, HP, pH, B/s, psi, Torr, atm, at, bar, kWh.

   9.   The unit names are case sensitive and the correct case needs to
        be used, but symbols that differ only in case should not be
        allocated.

   10.  A number after a unit typically indicates the previous unit
        raised to that power, and the / indicates that the units that
        follow are the reciprocal.  A unit should have only one / in the
        name.

   11.  A good list of common units can be found in the Unified Code for
        Units of Measure [UCUM].

12.2.  SenML label registry

   IANA will create a registry for SenML labels.  The initial content of
   the registry are shown in TODO.

   New entries can be added to the registration by either Expert Review
   or IESG Approval as defined in [RFC5226].  Experts should exercise
   their own good judgment but need to consider that shorter labels
   should have more strict review.

12.3.  Media Type Registration

   The following registrations are done following the procedure
   specified in [RFC6838] and [RFC7303].

12.3.1.  senml+json Media Type Registration

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: senml+json and sensml+json

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using a subset of the
   encoding allowed in [RFC7159].  See RFC-AAAA for details.  This
   simplifies implementation of very simple system and does not impose
   any significant limitations as all this data is meant for machine to
   machine communications and is not meant to be human readable.

   Security considerations: Sensor data can contain a wide range of
   information ranging from information that is very public, such the
   outside temperature in a given city, to very private information that
   requires integrity and confidentiality protection, such as patient
   health information.  This format does not provide any security and

   instead relies on the transport protocol that carries it to provide
   security.  Given applications need to look at the overall context of
   how this media type will be used to decide if the security is
   adequate.

   Interoperability considerations: Applications should ignore any JSON
   key value pairs that they do not understand.  This allows backwards
   compatibility extensions to this specification.  The "ver" field can
   be used to ensure the receiver supports a minimal level of
   functionality needed by the creator of the JSON object.

   that report electrical power usage and environmental information such
   as temperature and humidity.  It can be used for a wide range of

14.  Privacy Considerations

   Sensor data can range from information with almost no security
   considerations, such as the current temperature in a given city, to
   highly sensitive medical or location data.  This specification
   provides no security protection for the data but is meant to be used
   inside another container or transport protocol such as S/MIME or HTTP
   with TLS that can provide integrity, confidentiality, and
   authentication information about the source of the data.

15.  Acknowledgement

   We would like to thank Lisa Dusseault, Joe Hildebrand, Lyndsay
   Campbell, Martin Thomson, John Klensin, Bjoern Hoehrmann, Carsten
   Bormann, and Christian Amsuess for their review comments.

   The CBOR Representation text and CDDL was contributed by Carsten
   Bormann.

   The link extension can be an array of objects that can be used for
   additional information.  Each object in the Link array is constrained
   to being a map of strings to strings with unique keys.

   The following shows an example of the links extension.

   [{"bn": "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063/",
     "bt": 1320078429,
     "l": "[{\"href\":\"humidity\",\"foo\":\"bar1\"}\"
     },
     { "n": "temperature", "v": 27.2, "u": "Cel" },
     { "n": "humidity", "v": 80, "u": "%RH" }
