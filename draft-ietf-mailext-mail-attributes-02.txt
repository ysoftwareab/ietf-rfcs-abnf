                        Status of this Memo

  Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
  months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other

  This memo provides information for the Internet community. This'
  memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind, since
  this document is mainly a compilation of information taken from

                            Abstract

This memo contains a table of commonly occurring attributes in
headings and on envelopes of e-mail messages. The document compiles
information from other RFC-s such as RFC 821, RFC 822, RFC 1036,
RFC 1123, RFC 1327, RFC 1496, RFC 1521 and RFC 1766. A few commonly
occurring attributes which are not defined in RFC-s are also
included. For each attribute, the memo gives a short description
and a reference to the RFC, in which the attribute is defined.

                         1. Introduction

Many different Internet standards and RFC-s define attributes which
may occur on Internet Mail Messages and Network News Articles. The
intention of this document is to list all such attributes in one
document as an aid to people developing message systems or interested
in Internet Mail standards.

The document contains all heading attributes which the author has
found in the following Internet standards: RFC 821 [1], RFC 822 [2],
RFC 1036 [3], RFC 1123 [5], RFC 1327 [7], RFC 1496 [8], RFC 1521 [11]
and RFC 1766 [12]. Note in particular that heading attributes defined
in RFC 1421-1424, "Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail",
are not included. A few additional attributes which often can be
found in e-mail headings but are not part of any Internet standard are
also included.

For each heading attribute, the document gives a short description and
a reference to the Internet standard or RFC, in which they are defined.



                 2. Use of gatewaying attributes

RFC 1327 defines a number of new attributes in Internet mail, which
are defined to map attributes which X.400 has but which were
previously not standardized in Internet mail. The fact that an
attribute occurs in RFC 1327 indicates that it is recommended for
use in gatewaying messages between X.400 and Internet mail, but
does not mean that the attribute is recommended for messages wholly
within Internet mail. Some of these attributes may eventually get
accepted also for usage within Internet mail, but they are, when
this is written (July 1995) not recommended for such usage.

Fields defined in RFC 1036 for use in Usenet News sometimes appear
in mail messages, either because the messages have been gatewayed
from Usenet News to e-mail, or because the messages were written in
combined clients supporting both e-mail and Usenet News in the same
client. These fields are however not standardized for use in
Internet e-mail and should be handled with caution.

Fields are given here in the spelling used in e-mail headers. This
may sometimes be English, sometimes American spelling. One attribute,
"Organisation/Organization" occurs in e-mail headers sometimes with
English, sometimes with American spelling.

                      3. Table of attributes

3.1 Phrases used in the tables

"not for general        Used to mark attributes which are defined in
usage"                  RFC 1327 for use in messages from or to
                        Internet mail/X.400 gateways. These attributes
                        have not been standardized for general usage
                        in the exchange of messages between Internet
                        mail-based systems.

"not standardized       Used to mark attributes defined only in RFC
for use in e-mail"      1036 for use in Usenet News. These attributes
                        have no standard meaning when appearing in e-
                        mail, some of them may even be used in
                        different ways by different software. When
                        appearing in e-mail, they should be handled
                        with caution. Note that RFC 1036, although
                        generally used as a standard for Usenet News,
                        is not an accepted IETF standard or on the
                        IETF standards track.

"non-standard"          This attribute is not specified in any of
                        those referenced RFC-s which are Internet
                        standards, draft standards or proposed
                        standards. The attribute appears here because
                        it is common in e-mail or Usenet News headers.
                        Usage of these attributes is not in general
                        recommended.

"discouraged"           This attribute, which is non-standard, is
                        known to create problems and should not be
                        generated. Handling of such attributes in
                        incoming mail should be done with great
                        caution.

"controversial"         The meaning and usage of this attribute is
                        controversial, i.e. different implementors
                        have chosen to implement the attribute in
                        different ways. Because of this, such
                        attributes should be handled with caution and
                        understanding of the different possible
                        interpretations.

"for limited use"       A so-called "experimental" Internet standard.
                        These should be used only if both parties
                        agree.

Unfortunately, the specification
in RFC 822 is ambiguous, since
some people want this to be a
replacement for all recipients in
commands to send replies to all
recipients of the replied-to
message. The most general
consensus, however, seems to be
that "Reply-To" only indicates
replacement for the "From" field,
not for all the recipients.
