Abstract

   This document defines an extension to the SIP registration event
   package for communicating whether or not a registrar has obtained
   permission to perform a translation that was set up through a
   registration.  This extension is used by registrars implementing the
   framework for consent-based communications in SIP.

Internet-Draft         Reg Event Consent Extension         February 2006


1.  Introduction

   The framework for consent-based communications in SIP [5] identifies
   the need for registrars to inform user agents about the consent-
   related status of their registrations.  That is, user agents need to
   know whether or not their registrar has obtained permission to
   perform a particular translation that was set up through a
   registration.

   User agents are kept informed about the status of their registrations
   using the SIP [2] registration event package [3].  This event package
   has provision for including extension elements within the <contact>
   element.  This document defines a new element called <consent-status>
   that may be used to deliver the consent-related status of a
   registration.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.


3.  Description

   A new element <consent-status> is defined which contains the consent-
   related status of a registration.  This element can take the
   following values: 'pending', 'granted', or 'denied'.

   This optional element is included within the body of a NOTIFY for the
   "reg" event package when the framework for consent-communications in
   SIP is used.  The contact URI and the consent-related status are then
   both available to the watcher.


4.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   Unchanged from RFC 3680 [3].


5.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   A notifier for the "reg" event package [3] SHOULD include the
   <consent-status> element when the framework for consent-based
   communications in SIP is used.  When present, the <consent-status>

Internet-Draft         Reg Event Consent Extension         February 2006


   element MUST be positioned as an instance of the <any> element within
   the <contact> element.


6.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   Subscribers receive information about the consent-related status of
   registrations in "reg" event notifications with <contact> elements
   containing <consent-status> elements.

   Subscribers that are unaware of this extension will, as required by
   [3], ignore the <consent-status> element.


7.  Example

   The following is an example registration information document
   including the new <consent-status> element:



   <?xml version="1.0"?>
       <reginfo xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:reginfo"
           xmlns:cs="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:consent-status"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           version="0" state="full">
         <registration aor="sip:user@example.com" id="as9"
              state="active">
           <contact id="76" state="active" event="registered"
              duration-registered="7322"
              q="0.8">
                <uri>sip:user@192.0.2.1</uri>
                <cs:consent-status>pending</cs:consent-status>
           </contact>
         </registration>
       </reginfo>


8.  XML Schema Definition

   A consent-status document is an XML document that MUST be well-formed
   and SHOULD be valid.  Consent-status documents MUST be based on XML
   1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  This specification makes use of
   XML namespaces for identifying consent-status documents.  The
   namespace URI for elements defined for this purpose is a URN, using
   the namespace identifier 'ietf'.  This URN is:

9.  IANA Considerations

   There are two IANA considerations associated with this specification.

9.1.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration

   This section registers a new XML namespace, per the guidelines in
   [4].

   URI: The URI for this namespace is
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:consent-status

   Registrant Contact: IETF, SIPPING working group, <sipping@ietf.org>,
   Gonzalo Camarillo <Gonzalo.Camarillo@ericsson.com>

   XML:

   BEGIN
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.0//EN"
             "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic10.dtd">
   <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <head>
     <meta http-equiv="content-type"
        content="text/html;charset=iso-8859-1"/>
     <title>Consent-related Status Extension Namespace</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>Namespace for Consent-related Status Information Extension</h1>
     <h2>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:consent-status</h2>
     <p>See <a href="[URL of published RFC]">RFCXXXX [[NOTE TO
   RFC-EDITOR/IANA: Please replace XXXX with the RFC Number of
   this specification]]</a>.</p>
    </body>
   </html>
   END

9.2.  XML Schema Registration

   This section registers an XML schema per the procedures in [4].

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:consent-status.

   Registrant Contact: IETF, SIPPING working group, <sipping@ietf.org>,
   Gonzalo Camarillo <Gonzalo.Camarillo@ericsson.com>

   The XML for this schema can be found in Section 8.


10.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the registration event package are
   discussed in RFC 3680 [3], and those considerations apply here.

   The addition of consent-related information does not impact security
   negatively because that information is less sensitive than the
   contact URI itself.
