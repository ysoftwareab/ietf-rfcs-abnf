<h1><br />Recommendation for a Routing Architecture<br />draft-irtf-rrg-recommendation-04</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
	It is commonly recognized that the Internet routing and addressing
	architecture is facing challenges in scalability, multi-homing, and
	inter-domain traffic engineering.  This document reports the
	Routing Research Group's preliminary findings from its efforts
	towards developing a recommendation for a scalable routing
	architecture.
      
</p>
<p>
	This document is a work in progress.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Critique</h3>

<p>
	  LISP-ALT distributes mapping to ITRs via (optional, local,
	  potentially-caching) Map Resolvers and with globally distributed
	  query servers: ETRs and optional Map Servers.
	
</p>
<p>
	  A fundamental problem with any global query server network is
	  that the frequently long paths and greater risk of packet loss
	  cause ITRs to drop or significantly delay the initial packets of
	  many new sessions.  ITRs drop the packet(s) they have no mapping
	  for.  After the mapping arrives, the ITR waits for a resent
	  packet and will tunnel that packet correctly.  These "initial
	  packet delays" reduce performance and so create a major barrier
	  to voluntary adoption on wide enough basis to solve the routing
	  scaling problem.
	
</p>
<p>
	  ALT's delays are compounded by its structure being "aggressively
	  aggregated", without regard to the geographic location of the
	  routers.  Tunnels between ALT routers will often span
	  intercontinental distances and traverse many Internet routers.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The many levels to which a query typically ascends in the ALT
	  hierarchy before descending towards its destination will often
	  involve excessively long geographic paths and so worsen initial
	  packet delays.
	
</p>
<p>
	  No solution has been proposed for these problems or for the
	  contradiction between the need for high aggregation while making
	  the ALT structure robust against single points of failure.
	
</p>
<p>
	  LISP's ITRs multihoming service restoration depends on them
	  determining reachability of end-user networks via two or more
	  ETRs.  Large numbers of ITRs doing this is inefficient and may
	  overburden ETRs.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Testing reachability of the ETRs is complex and costly - and
	  insufficient.  ITRs cannot test network reachability via each
	  ETR, since the ITRs have no address of a device in that network.
	  So ETRs must report network un-reachability to ITRs.
	
</p>
<p>
	  LISP involves complex communication between ITRs and ETRs, with
	  UDP and 64-bit LISP headers in all traffic packets.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The advantage of LISP+ALT is that its ability to handle billions
	  of EIDs is not constrained by the need to transmit or store the
	  mapping to any one location.  Such numbers, beyond a few tens of
	  millions of EIDs, will only result if the system is used for
	  Mobility.  Yet the concerns just mentioned about ALT's structure
	  arise from the millions of ETRs which would be needed just for
	  non-mobile networks.
	
</p>
<p>
	  In LISP's mobility approach each MN needs an RLOC address to be
	  its own ETR, meaning the MN cannot be behind NAT. Mapping changes
	  must be sent instantly to all relevant ITRs every time the MN
	  gets a new address - which LISP cannot achieve.
	
</p>
<p>
	  In order to enforce ISP filtering of incoming packets by source
	  address, LISP ITRs would have to implement the same filtering on
	  each decapsulated packet. This may be prohibitively expensive.
	
</p>
<p>
	  LISP monolithically integrates multihoming failure detection and
	  restoration decision-making processes into the core-edge
	  separation scheme itself.  End-user networks must rely on the
	  necessarily limited capabilities which are built into every ITR.
	
</p>
<p>
	  LISP-ALT may be able to solve the routing scaling problem, but
	  alternative approaches would be superior because they eliminate
	  the initial packet delay problem and give end-user networks
	  real-time control over ITR tunneling.

Key Idea</h3>

<p>
	    Similar to HIP <a class='info' href='#RFC4423'>[RFC4423]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moskowitz, R. and P. Nikander, &ldquo;Host Identity Protocol (HIP) Architecture,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, RANGI introduces a host
	    identifier layer between the network layer and the transport
	    layer, and the transport-layer associations (i.e., TCP
	    connections) are no longer bound to IP addresses, but to host
	    identifiers. The major difference from the HIP is that the host
	    identifier in RANGI is a 128-bit hierarchical and cryptographic
	    identifier which has organizational structure. As a result, the
	    corresponding ID->locator mapping system for such identifiers has
	    reasonable business model and clear trust boundaries. In
	    addition, RANGI uses IPv4-embeded IPv6 addresses as locators. The
	    LD ID (i.e., the leftmost 96 bits) of this locator is a
	    provider-assigned /96 IPv6 prefix, while the last four octets of
	    this locator is a local IPv4 address (either public or
	    private). This special locator could be used to realize 6over4
	    automatic tunneling (borrowing ideas from ISATAP
	    <a class='info' href='#RFC5214'>[RFC5214]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Templin, F., Gleeson, T., and D. Thaler, &ldquo;Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>), which will reduce the deployment cost
	    of this new routing architecture. Within RANGI, the mappings from
	    FQDN to host identifiers are stored in the DNS system, while the
	    mappings from host identifiers to locators are stored in a
	    distributed id/locator mapping system (e.g., a hierarchical
	    Distributed Hash Table (DHT) system, or a reverse DNS system).

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.2"></a><h3>3.1.2.&nbsp;
Gains</h3>

<p>
	    RANGI achieves almost all of goals set by RRG as follows:
	    </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
		Routing Scalability: Scalability is achieved by decoupling
		identifiers from locators.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Traffic Engineering: Hosts located in a multi-homed site can
		suggest the upstream ISP for outbound and inbound traffics,
		while the first-hop LDBR (i.  e., site border router) has the
		final decision right on the upstream ISP selection.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Mobility and Multi-homing: Sessions will not be interrupted
		due to locator change in cases of mobility or multi-homing.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Simplified Renumbering: When changing providers, the local
		IPv4 addresses of the site do not need to change. Hence the
		internal routers within the site don't need renumbering.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Decoupling Location and Identifier: Obvious.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Routing Stability: Since the locators are topologically
		aggregatable and the internal topology within LD will not be
		disclosed outside, the routing stability could be improved
		greatly.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Routing Security: RANGI reuses the current routing system
		and does not introduce any new security risk into the
		routing system.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Incremental Deployability: RANGI allows easy transition from
		IPv4 network to IPv6 network. In addition, RANGI proxy allows
		RANGI-aware hosts to communicate to legacy IPv4 or IPv6
		hosts, and vice versa.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Critique</h3>

<p>
	  RANGI is an ID/locator split protocol that, like HIP, places a
	  cryptographically signed ID between the network layer (IPv6) and
	  transport. Unlike the HIP ID, the RANGI ID has a hierarchical
	  structure that allows it to support ID->locator lookups. This
	  hierarchical structure addresses two weaknesses of the flat HIP
	  ID: the difficulty of doing the ID->locator lookup, and the
	  administrative scalability of doing firewall filtering on flat
	  IDs. The usage of this hierarchy is overloaded: it serves to make
	  the ID unique, to drive the lookup process, and possibly other
	  things like firewall filtering.  More thought is needed as to
	  what constitutes these levels with respect to these various
	  roles.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The RANGI draft suggests FQDN->ID lookup through DNS, and
	  separately an ID->locator lookup which may be DNS or may be
	  something else (a hierarchy of DHTs).  It would be more efficient
	  if the FQDN lookup produces both ID and locators (as does ILNP).
	  Probably DNS alone is sufficient for the ID->locator lookup since
	  individual DNS servers can hold very large numbers of mappings.
	
</p>
<p>
	  RANGI provides strong sender identification, but at the cost of
	  computing crypto.  Many hosts (public web servers) may prefer to
	  forgo the crypto at the expense of losing some functionality
	  (receiver mobility or dynamic multihome load balance).  While
	  RANGI doesn't require that the receiver validate the sender, it
	  may be good to have a mechanism whereby the receiver can signal
	  to the sender that it is not validating, so that the sender can
	  avoid locator changes.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Architecturally there are many advantages to putting the mapping
	  function at the end host (versus at the edge).  This simplifies
	  the neighbor aliveness and delayed first packet problems, and
	  avoids stateful middleboxes.  Unfortunately, the early-adopter
	  incentive for host upgrade may not be adequate (HIP's lack of
	  uptake being an example).
	
</p>
<p>
	  RANGI does not have an explicit solution for the mobility race
	  condition (there is no mention of a home-agent like device).
	  However, host-to-host notification combined with fallback on the
	  ID->locators lookup (assuming adequate dynamic update of the
	  lookup system) may be good enough for the vast majority of
	  mobility situations.
	
</p>
<p>
	  RANGI uses proxies to deal with both legacy IPv6 and IPv4 sites.
	  RANGI proxies have no mechanisms to deal with the edge-to-edge
	  aliveness problem. The edge-to-edge proxy approach dirties-up an
	  otherwise clean end-to-end model.
	
</p>
<p>
	  RANGI exploits existing IPv6 transition technologies (ISATAP and
	  softwire).  These transition technologies are in any event being
	  pursued outside of RRG and do not need to be specified in RANGI
	  drafts per se.  RANGI only needs to address how it interoperates
	  with IPv4 and legacy IPv6, which through proxies it appears to do
	  adequately well.

	    voluntary adoption <a class='info' href='#Ivip Constraints'>[Ivip Constraints]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Whittle, R., &ldquo;List of constraints on a successful scalable routing solution 	    which result from the need for widespread voluntary adoption,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    Ivip's global fast-push mapping distribution network is
	    structured like a cross-linked multicast tree.  This pushes all
	    mapping changes to full database query servers (QSDs) within
	    ISPs and end-user networks which have ITRs.  Each mapping
	    change is sent to all QSDs within a few seconds.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    ITRs gain mapping information from these local QSDs within a
	    few tens of milliseconds.  QSDs notify ITRs of changed mapping
	    with similarly low latency.  ITRs tunnel all traffic packets to
	    the correct ETR without significant delay.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    Ivip's mapping consists of a single ETR address for each range
	    of mapped address space.  Ivip ITRs do not need to test
	    reachability to ETRs because the mapping is changed in
	    real-time to that of the desired ETR.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    End-user networks control the mapping, typically by contracting
	    a specialized company to monitor the reachability of their ETRs
	    and change the mapping to achieve multihoming and/or TE.  So
	    the mechanisms which control ITR tunneling are controlled by
	    the end-user networks in real-time and are completely separate
	    from the core-edge separation scheme itself.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    ITRs can be implemented in dedicated servers or hardware-based
	    routers.  The ITR function can also be integrated into sending
	    hosts.  ETRs are relatively simple and only communicate with
	    ITRs rarely - for Path MTU management with longer packets.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    Ivip-mapped ranges of end-user address space need not be subnets.
	    They can be of any length, in units of IPv4 addresses or IPv6 /64s.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    Compared to conventional unscalable BGP techniques, and to the
	    use of core-edge separation architectures with non-real-time
	    mapping systems, end-user networks will be able to achieve more
	    flexible and responsive inbound TE.  If inbound traffic is
	    split into several streams, each to addresses in different
	    mapped ranges, then real-time mapping changes can be used to
	    steer the streams between multiple ETRs at multiple ISPs.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    Open ITRs in the DFZ (OITRDs, similar to LISP's PTRs) tunnel
	    packets sent by hosts in networks which lack ITRs.  So
	    multihoming, portability and TE benefits apply to all traffic.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    ITRs request mapping either directly from a local QSD or via
	    one or more layers of caching query servers (QSCs) which in
	    turn request it from a local QSD.  QSCs are optional but
	    generally desirable since they reduce the query load on QSDs.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    ETRs may be in ISP or end-user networks.  IP-in-IP encapsulation is
	    used, so there is no UDP or any other header.  PMTUD (Path MTU
	    Discovery) management with minimal complexity and overhead will
	    handle the problems caused by encapsulation, and adapt smoothly to
	    jumboframe paths becoming available in the DFZ.  The outer header's
	    source address is that of the sending host - which enables existing
	    ISP BR filtering of source addresses to be extended to encapsulated
	    traffic packets by the simple mechanism of the ETR dropping packets
	    whose inner and outer source address do not match.

TTR Mobility</h3>

<p>
	      The TTR approach to mobility <a class='info' href='#Ivip Mobility'>[Ivip Mobility]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Whittle, R., &ldquo;TTR Mobility Extensions for Core-Edge Separation 	    Solutions to the Internet's Routing Scaling Problem,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> is
	      applicable to all core-edge separation techniques and provides
	      scalable IPv4 and IPv6 mobility in which the MN keeps its own
	      mapped IP address(es) no matter how or where it is physically
	      connected, including behind one or more layers of NAT.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      Path-lengths are typically optimal or close to optimal and
	      the MN communicates normally with all other non-mobile hosts
	      (no stack or app changes), and of course other MNs.  Mapping
	      changes are only needed when the MN uses a new TTR, which
	      would typically be if the MN moved more than 1000km.  Mapping
	      changes are not required when the MN changes its physical
	      address(es).

</p>
<p>
	    A small fee per mapping change deters frivolous changes and
	    helps pay for pushing the mapping data to all QSDs.  End-user
	    networks who make frequent mapping changes for inbound TE,
	    should find these fees attractive considering how it improves
	    their ability to utilize the bandwidth of multiple ISP links.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    End-user networks will typically pay the cost of OITRD

	    for OITRD deployment and avoids unfair distribution of costs.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    Existing source address filtering arrangements at BRs of ISPs
	    and end-user networks are prohibitively expensive to implement
	    directly in ETRs, but with the outer header's source address

<p>
	    QSDs receive all mapping changes and store a complete copy of

	    billion IPv6 mappings, each of 32 bytes, which fits on a
	    consumer hard drive today and should fit in server DRAM by the

<p>
	    The maximum number of non-mobile networks requiring multihoming

Critique</h3>

<p>
	  Looking at 1000 feet level, Ivip shares the basic design
	  approaches with LISP and a number of other Map-n-Encap designs
	  based on the core-edge separation.  However the details differ
	  substantially. Ivip design takes a bold assumption that, with
	  technology advances, one could afford to maintain a real time
	  distributed global mapping database for all networks and
	  hosts. Ivip proposes that multiple parties collaborate to build a
	  mapping distribution system which pushes all mapping information
	  and updates to local, full database query servers located in all
	  ISPs within a few seconds.  The system has no single point of
	  failure, and uses end-to end authentication.
	
</p>
<p>
	  "Real time, globally synchronized mapping database" is a critical
	  assumption in Ivip. Using that as a foundation, Ivip design
	  avoids several challenging design issues that LISP team has
	  studied extensively, which include
	  </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
	      special considerations of mobility support which adds
	      additional complexity to the overall system;
	    
</li>
<li>
	      prompt detection of ETR failures and notification to all
	      relevant ITRs, which turn out to be a rather difficult
	      problem; and
	    
</li>
<li>
	      development of LISP-ALT lookup sub-system. Ivip assumes the
	      existence of local query servers with full database with the
	      latest mapping information changes.
	    
</li>
</ol><p>
	
</p>
<p>
	  However to be considered as a viable solution to Internet routing
	  scalability problem, Ivip faces two fundamental questions.
	  First, it is an entirely open question whether a global-scale
	  system is able to achieve real time synchronized operations as
	  assumed by Ivip.  Past experiences suggest otherwise.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The second question concerns incremental rollout. Ivip represents
	  an ambitious approach, with real-time mapping and local full
	  database query servers - which many people regard as impossible.
	  Developing and implementing Ivip may take fair amount of
	  resources, yet there is an open question regarding how to
	  *quantify* the gains by first movers - both those who will
	  provide the Ivip infrastructure and those which will use
	  it. Significant global routing table reduction only happens when
	  a large enough number of parties have adopted Ivip. The same
	  question arises for most other proposals as well.
	
</p>
<p>
	  One belief is that Ivip's more ambitious mapping system makes a
	  good design tradeoff for the greater benefits for end-user
	  networks and for those which develop the infrastructure. Another
	  belief is that this ambitious design is not viable.

Key Idea</h3>

<p>
	    The hierarchical IPv4 framework is adding scalability in the
	    routing architecture by introducing hierarchy in the IPv4
	    address space. The hIPv4 addressing scheme is divided in two
	    parts, the Area Locator (ALOC) address space which is globally
	    unique and the Endpoint Locator (ELOC) address space which is
	    only regionally unique. The ALOC and ELOC prefixes are added as
	    an IP option to the IPv4 header as described in RFC
	    1385. Instead of creating a tunneling (i.e. overlay) solution a
	    new routing element is needed in every ALOC realm, a Locator
	    Swap Router - the current IPv4 forwarding plane remains intact,
	    also no new routing protocols or mapping systems are required.
	    The control plane of the ALOC realm routers needs some
	    modification in order for ICMP to be compatible with the hIPv4
	    framework. When an area (one or several AS) of an ISP has
	    become an ALOC realm only ALOC prefixes are exchanged with
	    other ALOC realms. Directly attached ELOC prefixes are only
	    inserted to the RIB of the local ALOC realm, ELOC prefixes are
	    not distributed in the DFZ. Multi-homing can be achieved in two
	    ways, either the enterprise request an ALOC prefix from the RIR
	    (this is not recommended) or the enterprise receive the ALOC
	    prefixes from their upstream ISPs - ELOC prefixes are PI
	    addresses and remains intact when a upstream ISP is changed,
	    only the ALOC prefixes is replaced. When the RIB of DFZ is
	    compressed no longer an ingress router knows if the destination
	    prefix is available or not, only attachment points (ALOC
	    prefixes) of the destination prefix are advertised in the
	    DFZ. Thus the endpoints must take more responsibility for their
	    sessions. This can be achieved by using multipath enabled
	    transport protocols, such as SCTP and MPTCP, at the
	    endpoints. The multipath transport protocols also provides a
	    session identifier, i.e. verification tag/token, thus the
	    location and identifier split is carried out - site mobility,
	    endpoint mobility and mobile site mobility is achieved. DNS
	    needs to be upgraded, to resolve the location of an endpoint it
	    must have one ELOC value (current A-record) and at least one
	    ALOC value (in multi-homing solutions there will be several
	    ALOC values for an endpoint). The hIPv4 framework can also be
	    integrated to a map-and-encapsulate solution; the ITR/ETR needs
	    to incorporate the hIPv4 stack and might use a multipath
	    enabled transport protocol to serve the hIPv4/multipath
	    transport protocol enabled endpoints.

<li>
		Improved routing scalability: Adding hierarchy in the

		service provider that have migrated.

<li>
		Scalable support for traffic engineering: Multipath enabled

		Load-balancing schemes has been added to the framework;
		more research work is required around VLB switching.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Scalable support for multi-homing: Only attachment points
		of a multi-homed site are advertised in the DFZ, DNS will
		inform the requester how many attachment points the

		choice/responsibility which attachment point is used;
		endpoints using multipath enabled transport protocols can
		make use of several attachment points for a session.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Simplified Renumbering: When changing provider, the local ELOC
		prefixes remains intact, only the ALOC prefix is changed on the
		endpoints.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Decoupling Location and Identifier: The verification tag
		(SCTP) and token (MPTCP) can be considered to have the
		characteristics of a session identifier and thus a session
		layer is created between the transport and application
		layer in the TCP/IP model
	      
</li>
<li>
		Routing quality: The hIPv4 framework introduce no tunneling
		mechanisms, only a swap of the IPv4 header and locator
		header at the destination ALOC realm is required, thus
		current routing algorithms are preserved as such. Valiant
		Load-balancing might be used as a new forwarding mechanism.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Routing Security: Similar as with today's DFZ, except that

		longest match prefix) outside an ALOC realm (improved
		security)
	      
</li>
<li>
		Deployability: The hIPv4 framework is an evolution of the

	    At the edge network, we introduce a new type of gateway NTR (Name
	    Transfer Relay), which block the PI addresses of edge networks
	    into upstream transit networks.  NTRs performs address and/or
	    port translation between blocked PI addresses and globally
	    routable addresses, which seem like today's widely used NAT/NAPT
	    devices.  Both legacy and NOL applications behind a NTR can
	    access the outside as usual. To access the hosts behind a NTR
	    from outside, we need to use NOL traverse the NTR by name and
	    initiate connections to the hosts behind it.

<p>
	    Different from proposed host-based ID/Locator split solutions,

Critique</h3>

<p>
	  </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
	      Applications on hosts need to be rebuilt based on name
	      overlay library to be NOL-enabled. The legacy softwares that
	      are not maintained any more will not contribute benefits for
	      routing scalability in the core-edge elimination
	      situation. In the core-edge separation scheme, a new gateway
	      NTR (Name Transfer Relay) is deployed to prevent edge
	      specific PI prefixes into transit core. It doesn't impede the
	      legacy ends behind the NTR to access the outside Internet,
	      but the legacy ends cannot or is difficult to access the ends
	      behind a NTR without the help of NOL.
	    
</li>
<li>
	      In the scenario of core-edge elimination, the end site will
	      assigned to multiple PA address space, which lead to
	      renumbering troubles on switching to other upstream
	      providers. Upgrading ends to support NOL doesn't give any
	      benefits to edge networks. It has little incentives to use 
	      NOL in the core-edge elimination, and the same to other
	      host-based ID/locator split proposals. I believe that the
	      edge networks prefer PI address space to PA address space
	      whether they are IPv4 or IPv6 networks.
	    
</li>
<li>
	      In the scenario of core-edge separation, the additional
	      gateway NTR is to prevent the specific prefixes from the edge
	      networks, just like a NAT or the ITR/ETR of LISP. A NTR
	      gateway is can be seen as an extension of NAT (Network
	      Address Translation). Although NATs are deployed widely,
	      upgrading them to support NOL extension or deploying
	      additional new gateway NTRs at the edge networks are on a
	      voluntary basis and have few economic incentives.
	    
</li>
<li>
	      The stateful or stateless translating for each packet
	      traversing a NTR will require the cost of the CPU and memory
	      of NTRs, and increase forwarding delay. Thus, it is not
	      appropriated to deploy NTRs at the high-level transit
	      networks where aggregated traffic maybe cause the congestion
	      at the NTRs.
	    
</li>
<li>
	      In the scenario of core-edge separation, the requirement of
	      multi-homing and inter-domain traffic engineering will make
	      end sites accessible via multiple different NTRs. For the
	      reliability, all of the association between multiple NTRs and
	      the end site name will be kept in DNS, which may increase the
	      load of DNS.
	    
</li>
<li>
	      In the support for mobility, it is necessary for the DNS to
	      update the corresponding name-NTR mapping records in time
	      when an end system move from behind one NTR to other
	      NTRs. The NOL-enabled end relies on NOL layer to keep the
	      continuity of applications data transport, while the
	      underlying TCP/UDP transport session would be broken when the
	      IP address changed.

Critique</h3>

<p>
	  LMS is a mapping mechanism and based on edge-core separations. In
	  fact, any proposal that needs a global mapping system with keys
	  of similar properties of that "edge address" in the edge-core
	  separation can use such a mechanism. This means that those keys
	  are globally unique (by authorization or just statistically), at
	  the disposal of edge users, and may have several satisfied
	  mappings (with different weights, maybe). Once a proposal that
	  needs mapping but doesn't specify the mapping mechanism, is used
	  to solve the scalability problem, LMS can be used to strengthen
	  its function.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The key idea of LMS is similar to LISP+ALT that the mapping
	  system should be hierarchically organized, to gain scalability in
	  the storage and update sense and to achieve quick index for
	  mapping lookup. However, LMS advocates an ISP-independent mapping
	  system and ETRs are not the authorities of mapping data. ETRs or
	  edge-sites report their mapping data to related mapping servers.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Though LMS assumes that mapping servers can be incrementally
	  deployed in that a server may not be constructed if none of its
	  administered edge addresses are allocated, and that mapping
	  servers can charge for their services, which provides the
	  economic reason for their existence, how this brand-new system
	  can be constructed is still not clear. Explicit layering is only
	  an ideal state, and it rather analyzes the layering limits and
	  feasibility, than provide a practical way for deployment.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The drawbacks of LMS's feasibility analysis also include 1)
	  based on current PC power and may not represent future
	  circumstances (especially for IPv6); 2) does not consider the
	  variability of address utilization. Some IP address spaces may be
	  effectively allocated and used while some may not, causing some
	  mapping servers overloaded while others poorly utilized. More
	  thoughts are needed as to the flexibility of the layer design.
	
</p>
<p>
	  LMS doesn't fit well for mobility. It does not solve the problem
	  when hosts move faster that the mapping updates and propagations
	  between relative mapping servers. On the other hand, mobile hosts
	  moving across ASes and changing their attach points (core
	  addresses) is less frequent than hosts moving within an AS.
	
</p>
<p>
	  I personally advocate that separation needs two planes: edge-core
	  separation, which is to gain routing table scalability;
	  identity-location separation, which is to achieve mobility. GLI
	  does a good clarification and in that case, LMS can be used to
	  provide identity-to-core address mapping. Of course, other
	  schemes may be competent and LMS can be incorporate with it if it
	  has globally seen keys and needs to map them to other namespaces.

</p>
<p>
	  First, in this 2-phase scheme, an AS is essentially the unit of
	  destinations (i.e. sending ITRs find out destination AS D, then
	  send data to one of of D's ETR).  This does not offer much choice

Key Idea</h3>

<p>
	    GLI-Split implements a separation between global routing (in the
	    global Internet outside edge networks) and local routing (inside
	    edge networks) and  using global and local locators (GLs, LLs). In
	    addition, a separate static identifier (ID) is used to identify
	    communication endpoints (e.g. nodes or services) independently of
	    any routing information. Locators and IDs are encoded in IPv6
	    addresses to enable backwards-compatibility with the IPv6
	    Internet. The higher order bits store either a GL or a LL while
	    the lower order bits contain the ID. A local mapping system maps
	    IDs to LLs and a global mapping system maps IDs to GLs. The full
	    GLI-mode requires nodes with upgraded networking stacks and
	    special GLI-gateways. The GLI-gateways perform stateless locator

Critique</h3>

<p>
	  GLI-Split makes a clear distinction between two separation
	  planes: the separation between identifier and locator, which is
	  to meet end-users needs including mobility; the separation
	  between local and global locator, to make the global routing
	  table scalable. The distinction is needed since ISPs and hosts
	  have different requirements, also make the changes inside and
	  outside GLI-domains invisible to their opposites.
	
</p>
<p>
	  A main drawback of GLI-Split is that it puts much burden on
	  hosts. Before routing a packet received from upper layers,
	  network stacks in hosts firstly need resolve the DNS name to an
	  IP address; if the IP address is GLI-formed, it may look up the
	  map from the identifier extracted from the IP address to the
	  local locator. If the communication is between different
	  GLI-domains, hosts may further look up the map from the
	  identifier to the global locator the local mapping system
	  forwarding requests to the global mapping system for hosts is
	  just an option. Though host lookup may ease the burden of
	  intermediate nodes which would otherwise to perform the mapping
	  lookup, the three lookups by hosts in the worst case may lead to
	  large delays unless a very efficient mapping mechanism is
	  devised. The work may also become unpractical for low-powered
	  hosts. On one hand, GLI-split can provide backward compatibility
	  where classic and upgraded IPv6 hosts can communicate, which is
	  its big virtue; while the upgrades may be costly to against
	  hosts enthusiasm to change, compared to the benefits they would
	  gain.
	
</p>
<p>
	  GLI-split provides additional features to improve TE and to
	  improve resilience, e.g., exerting multipath routing. However the
	  cost is that more burdens are placed on hosts, e.g. they may need
	  more lookup actions and route selections. However, the kind of
	  tradeoffs between costs and gains exists in most proposals.
	
</p>
<p>
	  I think one improvement of GLI-Split on its support for mobility
	  is to update DNS data as GLI-hosts move across
	  GLI-domains. Through this GLI-corresponding-node can query DNS to
	  get valid global locator of the GLI-mobile-node and need not to
	  query the global mapping system (unless it wants to do multipath
	  routing), giving more incentives for nodes to become
	  GLI-kind. The merit of GLI-Split, simplified-mobility-handover
	  provision, well supports this improvement.
	
</p>
<p>
	  GLI-Split claims to use rewriting instead of tunneling for
	  conversions between local and global locators, when packets span
	  GLI-domains. The major advantage is that this kind of rewriting
	  needs no extra states to maintain, since local and global
	  locators need not to map to each other. Many other rewriting
	  mechanisms instead need to maintain extra states. It also avoids
	  the MTU problem faced by the tunneling methods. However,
	  GLI-Split achieves this only by compressing the namespace size of
	  each attribute (identifier, local and global locator). GLI-Split
	  codes two terms (identifier and local/global locator) into an
	  IPv6 address, each has space size of 2^64 or less, while
	  map-and-encaps proposals assume that identifier and locator each
	  occupies 128 bits space, in the IPv6 scene.

<p>
	    Provides a method for locator-identifier separation using tunnels
	    between routers of the edge of the Internet transit
	    infrastructure. It enrichs BGP protocol for distributing the
	    identifier-to-locator mapping. Using new BGP atributes
	    "identifier prefixes" are assigned interdomain routing locators
	    so that they will not be installed in the RIB and will be moved
	    to a new table called Tunnel Information Base (TIB). Afterwards,
	    when routing a packet to the "identifier prefix", the TIB will be
	    searched first to perform tunnel imposition, and secondly the RIB
	    for actual routing.  After the edge router performs tunnel
	    imposition, all routers in the middle will route this packet
	    until the router being the tail-end of the tunnel.

Critique</h3>

<p>
	  The primary issue for ILNP is how the deployment incentives and
	  benefits line up with the RRG goal of reducing the rate of growth
	  of entries and churn in the core routing table.  If a site is
	  currently using PI space, it can only stop advertising that space
	  when the entire site is ILNP capable.  This needs at least clear
	  elucidation of the incentives for ILNP which are not related to
	  routing scaling, in order for there to be a path for this to
	  address the RRG needs.  Similarly, the incentives for upgrading
	  hosts need to align with the value for those hosts.
	
</p>
<p>
	  A closely related question is whether this mechanism actually
	  addresses the sites need for PI addresses.  Assuming ILNP is
	  deployed, the site does achieve flexible, resilient,
	  communication using all of its Internet connections.  While the
	  proposal address the host updates when the host learns of
	  provider changes, there are other aspects of provider change that
	  are not addressed.  This includes renumbering router, subnets,
	  and certain servers.  (It is presumed that most servers, once the
	  entire site has moved to ILNP, will not be concerned if their
	  locator changes.  However, some servers must have known locators,
	  such as the DNS server.)  The issues described in
	  draft-carpenter-renum-needs-work-04 will be ameliorated, but not
	  resolved.  To be able to adopt this proposal, and have sites use
	  it, we need to address these issues.  When a site changes points
	  of attachment only a small amount of DNS provisioning should be
	  required.  The LP record is apparently intended to help with
	  this.  It is also likely that the use of dynamic DNS will help
	  this.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The ILNP mechanism is described as being suitable for use in
	  conjunction with mobility.  This raises the question of race
	  conditions.  To the degree that mobility concerns are valid at
	  this time, it is worth asking how communication can be
	  established if a node is sufficiently mobile that it is moving
	  faster than the DNS update and DNS fetch cycle can effectively
	  propagate changes.
	
</p>
<p>
	  This proposal does presume that all communication using this
	  mechanism is tied to DNS names.  while it is true that most
	  communication does start from a DNS name, it is not the case that
	  all exchanges have this property.  Some communication initiation
	  and referral can be done with an explicit I/L pair.  This does
	  appear to require some extensions to the existing mechanism (for
	  both sides adding locators).  In general, some additional clarity
	  on the assumptions regarding DNS, particularly for low end
	  devices, would seem appropriate.
	
</p>
<p>
	  One issue that this proposal shares with many others is the
	  question of how to determine which locator pairs (local and
	  remote) are actually functional.  This is an issue both for
	  initial communications establishment, and for robustly
	  maintaining communication.  While it is likely that a combination
	  of monitoring of traffic (in the host, where this is tractable),
	  coupled with other active measures, can address this.  ICMP is
	  clearly insufficient.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
	    We present some architectural principles pertaining to the
	    mapping distribution protocols, especially applicable to
	    map-and-encap (e.g., LISP) type of protocols. These principles
	    enhance the efficiency of the map-and-encap protocols in terms of
	    (1) better utilization of resources (e.g., processing and memory)
	    at Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs) and mapping servers, and
	    consequently, (2) reduction of response time (e.g., first packet
	    delay). We consider how Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) can perform
	    aggregation of end-point ID (EID) address space belonging to
	    their downstream delivery networks, in spite of
	    migration/re-homing of some subprefixes to other ETRs. This
	    aggregation may be useful for reducing the processing load and
	    memory consumption associated with map messages, especially at
	    some resource-constrained ITRs and subsystems of the mapping
	    distribution system. We also consider another architectural
	    concept where the ETRs are organized in a hierarchical manner for
	    the potential benefit of aggregation of their EID address
	    spaces. The two key architectural ideas are discussed in some
	    more detail below. A more complete description can be found in a
	    document <a class='info' href='#EEMDP Considerations'>[EEMDP Considerations]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sriram, K., Kim, Y., and D. Montgomery, &ldquo;Architectural Considerations for Mapping Distribution Protocols,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> that was presented

Management of Mapping Distribution of Subprefixes
		 Spread Across Multiple ETRs</h3>

<p>
	    To assist in this discussion, we start with the high level
	    architecture of a map-and-encap approach (it would be helpful to
	    see Fig. 1 in the document mentioned above). In this architecture
	    we have the usual ITRs, ETRs, delivery networks, etc. In
	    addition, we have the ID-Locator Mapping (ILM) servers which are
	    repositories for complete mapping information, while the
	    ILM-Regional (ILM-R) servers can contain partial and/or
	    regionally relevant mapping information.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    While a large endpoint address space contained in a prefix may be
	    mostly associated with the delivery networks served by one ETR,
	    some fragments (subprefixes) of that address space may be located
	    elsewhere at other ETRs. Let a/20 denote a prefix that is
	    conceptually viewed as composed of 16 subnets of /24 size that
	    are denoted as a1/24, a2/24, :::, a16/24. For example, a/20 is
	    mostly at ETR1, while only two of its subprefixes a8/24 and
	    a15/24 are elsewhere at ETR3 and ETR2, respectively (see Fig. 2
	    in the document). From the point of view of efficiency of the
	    mapping distribution protocol, it may be beneficial for ETR1 to
	    announce a map for the entire space a/20 (rather than fragment it
	    into a multitude of more-specific prefixes), and provide the
	    necessary exceptions in the map information. Thus the map message
	    could be in the form of Map:(a/20, ETR1; Exceptions: a8/24,
	    a15/24). In addition, ETR2 and ETR3 announce the maps for a15/24
	    and a8/24, respectively, and so the ILMs know where the exception
	    EID addresses are located. Now consider a host associated with
	    ITR1 initiating a packet destined for an address a7(1), which is
	    in a7/24 that is not in the exception portion of a/20. Now a
	    question arises as to which of the following approaches would be
	    the best choice:
	    </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
		ILM-R provides the complete mapping information for a/20 to
		ITR1 including all maps for relevant exception subprefixes.
	      
</li>
<li>
		ILM-R provides only the directly relevant map to ITR1 which
		in this case is (a/20, ETR1).
	      
</li>
</ol><p>
	  
</p>
<p>
	    In the first approach, the advantage is that ITR1 would have the
	    complete mapping for a/20 (including exception subnets), and it
	    would not have to generate queries for subsequent first packets
	    that are destined to any address in a/20, including a8/24 and
	    a15/24. However, the disadvantage is that if there is a
	    significant number of exception subprefixes, then the very first
	    packet destined for a/20 will experience a long delay, and also
	    the processors at ITR1 and ILM-R can experience overload. In
	    addition, the memory usage at ITR1 can be very inefficient as
	    well. The advantage of the second approach above is that the
	    ILM-R does not overload resources at ITR1 both in terms of
	    processing and memory usage but it needs an enhanced map response
	    in of the form Map:(a/20, ETR1, MS=1), where MS (more specific)
	    indicator is set to 1 to indicate to ITR1 that not all subnets in
	    a/20 map to ETR1. The key idea is that aggregation is beneficial
	    and subnet exceptions must be handled with additional messages or
	    indicators in the maps.

Management of Mapping Distribution for Scenarios with
		 Hierarchy of ETRs and Multi-Homing</h3>

<p>
	    Now we highlight another architectural concept related to mapping
	    management (helpful here to refer to Fig. 3 in the
	    document). Here we consider the possibility that ETRs may be
	    organized in a hierarchical manner. For instance ETR7 is higher
	    in hierarchy relative to ETR1, ETR2, and ETR3, and like-wise ETR8
	    is higher relative to ETR4, ETR5, and ETR6. For instance, ETRs 1
	    through 3 can relegate locator role to ETR7 for their EID address
	    space. In essence, they can allow ETR7 to act as the locator for
	    the delivery networks in their purview. ETR7 keeps a local
	    mapping table for mapping the appropriate EID address space to
	    specific ETRs that are hierarchically associated with it in the
	    level below. In this situation, ETR7 can perform EID address
	    space aggregation across ETRs 1 through 3 and can also include
	    its own immediate EID address space for the purpose of that
	    aggregation. The many details related to this approach and
	    special circumstances involving multi-homing of subnets are
	    discussed in detail in the detailed document noted earlier. The
	    hierarchical organization of ETRs and delivery networks should
	    help in the future growth and scalability of ETRs and mapping
	    distribution networks. This is essentially recursive
	    map-and-encap, and some of the mapping distribution and
	    management functionality will remain local to topologically
	    neighboring delivery networks which are hierarchically underneath
	    ETRs.

Summary</h3>

<p>
	  As the Internet continues its rapid growth, router memory size and
	  CPU cycle requirements are outpacing feasible hardware upgrade
	  schedules. We propose to solve this problem by applying aggregation
	  with increasing scopes to gradually evolve the routing system
	  towards a scalable structure. At each evolutionary step, our
	  solution is able to interoperate with the existing system and
	  provide immediate benefits to adopters to enable deployment. This
	  document summarizes the need for an evolutionary design, the
	  relationship between our proposal and other revolutionary proposals
	  and the steps of aggregation with increasing scopes. Our detailed
	  proposal can be found in <a class='info' href='#I-D.zhang-evolution'>[I&#8209;D.zhang&#8209;evolution]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Zhang, B. and L. Zhang, &ldquo;Evolution Towards Global Routing Scalability,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Need for Evolution</h3>

<p>
	    Multiple different views exist regarding the routing scalability
	    problem.  Networks differ vastly in goals, behavior, and
	    resources, giving each a different view of the severity and
	    imminence of the scalability problem. Therefore we believe that,
	    for any solution to be adopted, it will start with one or a few
	    early adopters, and may not ever reach the entire Internet. The
	    evolutionary approach recognizes that changes to the Internet can
	    only be a gradual process with multiple stages. At each stage,
	    adopters are driven by and rewarded with solving an immediate
	    problem. Each solution must be deployable by individual networks
	    who deem it necessary at a time they deem it necessary, without
	    requiring coordination from other networks, and the solution has
	    to bring immediate relief to a single first-mover.

Relation to Other RRG Proposals</h3>

<p>
	    Most proposals take a revolutionary approach that expects the
	    entire Internet to eventually move to some new design whose
	    main benefits would not materialize until the vast majority of
	    the system has been upgraded; their incremental deployment plan
	    simply ensures interoperation between upgraded and legacy parts
	    of the system. In contrast, the evolutionary approach depicts a
	    picture where changes may happen here and there as needed, but
	    there is no dependency on the system as a whole making a
	    change. Whoever takes a step forward gains the benefit by
	    solving his own problem, without depending on others to take
	    actions.  Thus, deployability includes not only
	    interoperability, but also the alignment of costs and gains.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    The main differences between our approach and more revolutionary
	    map-encap proposals are: (a) we do not start with a pre-defined
	    boundary between edge and core; and (b) each step brings
	    immediate benefits to individual first-movers. Note that our
	    proposal neither interferes nor prevents any revolutionary
	    host-based solutions such as ILNP from being rolled out. However,
	    host-based solutions do not bring useful impact until a large
	    portion of hosts have been upgraded. Thus even if a host-based
	    solution is rolled out in the long run, an evolutionary solution
	    is still needed for the near term.

Aggregation with Increasing Scopes</h3>

<p>
	    Aggregating many routing entries to a fewer number is a basic
	    approach to improving routing scalability. Aggregation can take
	    different forms and be done within different scopes. In our
	    design, the aggregation scope starts from a single router, then
	    expands to a single network, and neighbor networks. The order of
	    the following steps is not fixed but merely a suggestion; it is
	    under each individual network's discretion which steps they
	    choose to take based on their evaluation of the severity of the
	    problems and the affordability of the solutions.
	    </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
		FIB Aggregation (FA) in a single router. A router
		algorithmically aggregates its FIB entries without changing
		its RIB or its routing announcements. No coordinations among
		routers is needed, nor any change to existing protocols. This
		brings scalability relief to individual routers with only a
		software upgrade.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Enabling 'best external' on PEs, ASBRs, and RRs, and turning
		on next-hop-self on RRs.  For heirarchical networks, the RRs
		in each PoP can serve as a default gateway for nodes in the
		PoP, thus allowing the non-RR nodes in each PoP to maintain
		smaller routing tables that only include paths that egress
		out of that PoP. This is known as 'topology-based mode'
		Virtual Aggregation, and can be done with existing hardware
		and configuration changes only. Please see
		<a class='info' href='#Evolution Grow Presenatation'>[Evolution Grow Presenatation]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Francis, P., Xu, X., Ballani, H., Jen, D., Raszuk, R., and L. Zhang, &ldquo;Virtual Aggregation (VA),&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> for details.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Virtual Aggregation (VA) in a single network. Within an AS,
		some fraction of existing routers are designated as
		Aggregation Point Routers (APRs). These routers are either
		individually or collectively maintain the full FIB
		table. Other routers may suppress entries from their FIBs,
		instead forwarding packets to APRs, which will then tunnel
		the packets to the correct egress routers. VA can be viewed
		as an intra-domain map-encap system to provide the operators
		a control mechanism for the FIB size in their routers.
	      
</li>
<li>
		VA across neighbor networks. When adjacent networks have VA
		deployed, they can go one step further by piggybacking egress
		router information on existing BGP announcements, so that
		packets can be tunneled directly to a neighbor network's
		egress router. This improves packet delivery performance by
		performing the encapsulation/decapsulation only once across
		these neighbor networks, as well as reducing the stretch of
		the path.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Reducing RIB Size by separating control plane from the data
		plane. Although a router's FIB can be reduced by FA or VA, it
		usually still needs to maintain the full RIB in order for
		routing announcements to its neighbors. To reduce the RIB
		size, a network can set up special boxes, which we call
		controllers, to take over the eBGP sessions from border
		routers.  The controllers receive eBGP announcements, make
		routing decisions, and then inform other routers in the same
		network of how to forward packets, while the regular routers
		just focus on the job of forwarding packets. The controllers,
		not being part of the data path, can be scaled using
		commodity hardware.
	      
</li>
<li>
		Insulating forwarding routers from routing churns. For
		routers with a smaller RIB, the rate of routing churns is
		naturally reduced. Further reduction can be achieved by not
		announcing failures of customer prefixes into the core, but
		handling these failures in a data-driven fashion, e.g., a
		link failure to an edge network is not reported unless and
		until there are data packets that are heading towards the
		failed link.

Critique</h3>

<p>
	  All the RRG proposals that scale the routing share one
	  fundamental approach, route aggregation, in different forms,
	  e.g., LISP removes "edge prefixes" using encapsulation at ITRs,
	  ILNP achieves the goal by locator rewrite. In this evolutionary
	  path proposal, each stage of the evolution applies aggregation
	  with increasing scopes to solve a specific scalability problem,
	  and eventually the path leads towards global routing
	  scalability. E.g., it uses FIB aggregation at single router
	  level, virtual aggregation at network level, then between
	  neighbor networks at inter-domain level.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Compared to others, this proposal has the lowest hurdle to
	  deployment, because it does not require all networks move to use
	  a global mapping system or to upgrade all hosts, and it is
	  designed for each individual network to get immediate benefits
	  after its own deployment.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Critiques to this proposal fall into two types.  The first type
	  concerns several potential issues in the technical design as
	  listed below:
	  </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
	      FIB aggregation, at level-3 and level-4, may introduce extra
	      routable space.  Concerns are raised about the potential
	      routing loops resulted from forwarding otherwise non-routable
	      packets, and potential impact on RPF checking.  These
	      concerns can be addressed by choosing a lower level of
	      aggregation and by adding null routes to minimize the extra
	      space, at the cost of reduced aggregation gain.
	    
</li>
<li>
	      Virtual Aggregation changes the traffic paths in an ISP
	      network, hence introduces path stretch. Changing the traffic
	      path may also impact the reverse path checking practice used
	      to filter out packets from spoofed sources.  More analysis is
	      need to identify the potential side-effects of VA and to
	      address
	    
</li>
<li>
	      The current Virtual aggregation description is difficult to
	      understand, due to its multiple options for encapsulation and
	      popular prefix configurations, which makes the mechanism look
	      over-complicated. More thought is needed to simplify the
	      design and description.
	    
</li>
<li>
	      FIB Aggregation and Virtual Aggregation may require
	      additional operational cost.  There may be new design
	      trade-offs that the operators need to understand in order to
	      select the best option for their networks. More analysis is
	      needed to identify and quantify all potential operational
	      costs.
	    
</li>
<li>
	      Different from a number of other proposals, this solution
	      does not provide mobility support. It remains an open
	      question whether the routing system should handle mobility.
	    
</li>
</ol><p>
	
</p>
<p>
	  The second type of critique concerns whether deploying quick
	  fixes like FIB aggregation would alleviate scalability problems
	  in the short term and reduce the incentives for deployong a new
	  architecture; and whether an evolutionary approach would end up
	  with adding more and more patches on the old architecture, and
	  not lead to a fundamentally new architecture as the proposal had
	  expected.  Though this solution may get rolled out more easily
	  and quicker, a new architecture, if/once deployed, could solve
	  more problems with cleaner solutions.

Summary</h3>

<p>
	  Name-based sockets are an evolution of the existing address-based
	  sockets, enabling applications to initiate and receive
	  communication sessions by use of domain names in lieu of IP
	  addresses.  Name-based sockets move the existing indirection from
	  domain names to IP addresses from its current position in
	  applications down to the IP layer.  As a result, applications
	  communicate exclusively based on domain names, while the
	  discovery, selection, and potentially in-session re-selection of
	  IP addresses is centrally performed by the operating system.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Name-based sockets help mitigate the Internet routing scalability
	  problem by separating naming and addressing more consistently
	  than what is possible with the existing address-based sockets.
	  This supports IP address aggregation because it simplifies the
	  use of IP addresses with high topological significance, as well
	  as the dynamic replacement of IP addresses during
	  network-topological and host-attachment changes.
	
</p>
<p>
	  A particularly positive effect of name-based sockets on Internet
	  routing scalability is new incentives for edge network operators
	  to use provider-assigned IP addresses, which are better
	  aggregatable than the typically preferred provider-independent IP
	  addresses.  Even though provider-independent IP addresses are
	  harder to get and more expensive than provider-assigned IP
	  addresses, many operators desire provider- independent addresses
	  due to the high indirect cost of provider-assigned IP addresses.
	  This indirect cost comprises both, difficulties to multi- home,
	  and tedious and largely manual renumbering upon provider changes.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Name-based sockets reduce the indirect cost of provider-assigned
	  IP addresses in three ways, and hence make the use of
	  provider-assigned IP addresses more acceptable: (1) They enable
	  fine-granular and responsive multi-homing.  (2) They simplify
	  renumbering by offering an easy means to replace IP addresses in
	  referrals with domain names.  This helps avoiding updates to
	  application and operating system configurations, scripts, and
	  databases during renumbering.  (3) They facilitate low-cost
	  solutions that eliminate renumbering altogether.  One such
	  low-cost solution is IP address translation, which in combination
	  with name-based sockets loses its adverse impact on applications.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Prerequisite for a positive effect of name-based sockets on
	  Internet routing scalability is their adoption in operating
	  systems and applications.  Operating systems should be augmented
	  to offer name-based sockets as a new alternative to the existing
	  address-based sockets, and applications should use name-based
	  sockets for their communications.  Neither an instantaneous, nor
	  an eventually complete transition to name-based sockets is
	  required, yet the positive effect on Interent routing scalability
	  will grow with the extent of this transition.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Name-based sockets were hence designed with focus on deployment
	  incentives, comprising both immediate deployment benefits as well
	  as low deployment costs.  Name-based sockets provide a benefit to
	  application developers because the alleviation of applications
	  from IP address management responsibilities simplifies and
	  expedites application development.  This benefit is immediate
	  owing to the backwards compatibility of name-based sockets with
	  legacy applications and legacy peers.  The appeal to application
	  developers, in turn, is an immediate benefit for operating system
	  vendors who adopt name-based sockets.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Name-based sockets furthermore minimize deployment costs:
	  Alternative techniques to separate naming and addressing provide
	  applications with "surrogate IP addresses" that dynamically map
	  onto regular IP addresses.  A surrogate IP address is
	  indistinguishable from a regular IP address for applications, but
	  does not have the topological significance of a regular IP
	  address.  Mobile IP and the Host Identity Protocol are examples
	  of such separation techniques.  Mobile IP uses "home IP
	  addresses" as surrogate IP addresses with reduced topological
	  significance.  The Host Identity Protocol uses "host identifiers"
	  as surrogate IP addresses without topological significance.  A
	  disadvantage of surrogate IP addresses is their incurred cost in
	  terms of extra administrative overhead and, for some techniques,
	  extra infrastructure.  Since surrogate IP addresses must be
	  resolvable to the corresponding regular IP addresses, they must
	  be provisioned in the DNS or similar infrastructure.  Mobile IP
	  uses a new infrastructure of home agents for this purpose, while
	  the Host Identity Protocol populates DNS servers with host
	  identities.  Name-based sockets avoid this cost because they
	  function without surrogate IP addresses, and hence without the
	  provisioning and infrastructure requirements that accompany
	  those.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Certainly, some edge networks will continue to use
	  provider-independent addresses despite name-based sockets,
	  perhaps simply due to inertia. But name-based sockets will help
	  reduce the number of those networks, and thus have a positive
	  impact on Internet routing scalability.

Critique</h3>

<p>
	  Name-based sockets contribution to the routing scalability
	  problem is to decrease the reliance on PI addresses, allowing a
	  greater use of PA addresses, and thus a less fragmented routing
	  table. It provides end hosts with an API which makes the
	  applications address-agnostic. The name abstraction allows the
	  hosts to use any type of locator, independent of format or
	  provider. This increases the motivation and usability of PA
	  addresses. Some applications, in particular bootstrapping
	  applications, may still require hard coded IP addresses, and as
	  such will still motivate the use of PI addresses.

<a name="rfc.section.15.2.1"></a><h3>15.2.1.&nbsp;
Deployment</h3>

<p>
	    The main incentives and drivers are geared towards the
	    transition of applications to the name-based sockets. Adoption
	    by applications will be driven by benefits in terms of reduced
	    application development cost. Legacy applications are expected
	    to migrate to the new API in a slower pace, as the name-based
	    sockets are backwards compatible, this can happen in an
	    per-host fashion. Also, not all applications can be ported to a
	    FQDN dependent infrastructure, e.g. DNS functions. This hurdle
	    is manageable, and may not be a definite obstacle for the
	    transition of a whole domain, but it needs to be taken into
	    account when striving for mobility/multi-homing of an entire
	    site. The transition of functions on individual hosts may be
	    trivial, either through upgrades/changes to the OS or as linked
	    libraries. This can still happen incrementally and disjoint, as
	    compatibility is not affected by the use of name-based sockets.

Edge-networks</h3>

<p>
	    The name-based sockets rely on the transition of individual
	    applications, the name-based sockets are backwards compatible,
	    hence it does not require bilateral upgrades. This does allow
	    each host to migrate its applications independently. Name-based
	    sockets may make an individual client agnostic to the
	    networking medium, be it PA/PI IP-addresses or in a the future
	    an entirely different networking medium. However, an entire
	    edge-network, with internal and external services will not be
	    able to make a complete transition in the near future. Hence,
	    even if a substantial fraction of the hosts in an edge-network
	    use name-based sockets, PI addresses may still be required by
	    the edge-network. In short, new services may be implemented
	    using name-based sockets, old services may be
	    ported. Name-based sockets provide an increased motivation to
	    move to PA-addresses as actual provider independence relies
	    less and less on PI-addressing.

<a name="rfc.section.16.1"></a><h3>16.1.&nbsp;
Summary</h3>

<p>
	  RANGER is a locator-identifier separation approach that uses
	  IP-in-IP encapsulation to connect edge networks across transit
	  networks such as the global Internet. End systems use endpoint
	  interface identifier (EID) addresses that may be routable within
	  edge networks but do not appear in transit network routing
	  tables. EID to Routing Locator (RLOC) address bindings are
	  instead maintained in mapping tables and also cached in default
	  router FIBs (i.e., very much the same as for the global DNS and
	  its associated caching resolvers). RANGER enterprise networks are
	  organized in a recursive hierarchy with default mappers
	  connecting lower layers to the next higher layer in the
	  hierarchy.  Default mappers forward initial packets and push
	  mapping information to lower-tier routers and end systems through
	  secure redirection.
	
</p>
<p>
	  RANGER is an architectural framework derived from the Intra-Site
	  Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP).
