           Survey of Domain Verification Techniques using DNS
             draft-sahib-domain-verification-techniques-01

Abstract

   Verification of ownership of domains in the Domain Name System (DNS)
   [RFC1034] [RFC1035] often relies on adding or editing DNS records
   within the domain.  This document surveys various techniques in wide
   use today, the pros and cons of each, and possible improvements.

1.  Introduction

   Many providers on the internet need users to prove that they control
   a particular domain before granting them some sort of privilege
   associated with that domain.  For instance, certificate authorities
   like Let's Encrypt [LETSENCRYPT] ask requesters of TLS certificates
   to prove that they operate the domain they're requesting the
   certificate for.  Providers generally allow for several different
   ways of proving domain control, some of which include manipulating
   DNS records.  This document focuses on DNS techniques for domain
   verification; other techniques (such as email or HTML verification)
   are out-of-scope.

   In practice, DNS-based verification often looks like the provider
   generating a random value and asking the requester to create a DNS
   record containing this random value and placing it at a location that
   the provider can query for.  Generally only one temporary DNS record
   is sufficient for proving domain ownership.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Provider: an internet-based provider of a service, for e.g., Let's
   Encrypt provides a certificate authority service or GitHub provides
   code-hosting services.  These services often require a user to verify
   that they control a domain.

3.  Verification Techniques

3.1.  TXT based

   TXT record-based DNS domain verification is usually the default
   option for DNS verification.  The service provider asks the user to
   add a DNS TXT record (perhaps through their domain host or DNS
   provider) at the domain with a certain value.  Then, the service
   provider does a DNS TXT query for the domain being verified and
   checks that the value exists.  For example, this is what a DNS TXT
   verification record could look like:

      example.com.   IN   TXT   "foo-verification=bar"

   Here, the value "bar" for the attribute "foo-verification" serves as
   the randomly-generated TXT value being added to prove ownership of
   the domain to Foo provider.  Although the original DNS protocol
   specifications did not associate any semantics with the DNS TXT
   record, [RFC1464] describes how to use them to store attributes in
   the form of ASCII text key-value pairs for a particular domain.  In
   practice, there is wide variation in the content of DNS TXT records
   used for domain verification, and they often do not follow the key-
   value pair model.  Even so, the rdata portion of the DNS TXT record
   has to contain the value being used to verify the domain.  The value
   is usually a randomly-generated token in order to guarantee that the
   entity who requested that the domain be verified (i.e. the person
   managing the account at Foo provider) is the one who has (direct or
   delegated) access to DNS records for the domain.  The generated token
   typically expires in a few days.  The TXT record is usually placed at

   the domain being verified ("example.com" in the example above).
   After a TXT record has been added, the service provider will usually
   take some time to verify that the DNS TXT record with the expected
   token exists for the domain.

   The same domain name can have multiple distinct TXT records (a TXT
   Record Set).

3.1.1.  Examples

3.1.1.1.  Let's Encrypt

   Let's Encrypt [LETSENCRYPT] has a challenge type "DNS-01" that lets a
   user prove domain ownership in accordance with the ACME protocol
   [RFC8555].  In this challenge, Let's Encrypt asks you to create a TXT
   record with a randomly-generated token at "_acme-
   challenge.<YOUR_DOMAIN>".  For example, if you wanted to prove domain
   ownership of "example.com", Let's Encrypt could ask you to create the
   DNS record:

    _acme-challenge.example.com.  IN  TXT "cE3A8qQpEzAIYq-T9DWNdLJ1_YRXamdxcjGTbzrOH5L"

   [RFC8555] (section 8.4) places requirements on the random value.

3.1.1.2.  Google Workspace

   [GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-TXT] asks the user to sign in with their
   administrative account and obtain their verification token as part of
   the setup process for Google Workspace.  The verification token is a
   68-character string that begins with "google-site-verification=",
   followed by 43 characters.  Google recommends a TTL of 3600 seconds.
   The owner name of the TXT record is the domain or subdomain neme
   being verified.

3.1.1.3.  GitHub

   GitHub asks you to create a DNS TXT record under "_github-challenge-
   ORGANIZATION-<YOUR_DOMAIN>", where ORGANIZATION stands for the GitHub
   organization name [GITHUB-TXT].  The code is a numeric code that
   expires in 7 days.

3.2.  CNAME based

   Less commonly than TXT record verification, service providers also
   provide the ability to verify domain ownership via CNAME records.
   This is used in case the user cannot create TXT records.  One common
   reason is that the domain name may already have CNAME record that
   aliases it to a 3rd-party target domain.  CNAMEs have a technical
   restriction that no other record types can be placed along side them
   at the same domain name ([RFC1034], Section 3.6.2).. The CNAME based
   domain verification method typically uses a randomized label
   prepended to the domain name being verified.

3.2.1.  Examples

3.2.1.1.  Google

   [GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-CNAME] lets you specify a CNAME record for
   verifying domain ownership.  The user gets a unique 12-character
   string that is added as "Host", with TTL 3600 (or default) and
   Destination an 86-character string beginning with "gv-" and ending
   with ".domainverify.googlehosted.com.".

   To verify a subdomain, the unique 12-character string is appended
   with the subdomain name for "Host" field for e.g.
   JLKDER712AFP.subdomain where subdomain is the subdomain being
   verified.

3.2.1.2.  AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

   To get issued a certificate by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), you can
   create a CNAME record to verify domain ownership [ACM-CNAME].  The
   record name for the CNAME looks like "_<random-token1>.example.com",
   which would point to "_<random-token2>.<random-token3>.acm-
   validations.aws."

   Note that if there are more than 5 CNAMEs being chained, then this
   method does not work.

3.3.  Common Patterns

3.3.1.  Name

   ACME and GitHub have a suffix of "_PROVIDER_NAME-challenge" in the
   Name field of the TXT record challenge.  For ACME, the full Host is
   "_acme-challenge.<YOUR_DOMAIN>", while for GitHub it is "_github-
   challenge-ORGANIZATION-<YOUR_DOMAIN>".  Both these patterns are
   useful for doing targeted domain verification, as discussed in
   section (#targeted-domain-verification) because if the provider knows

Internet-Draft       Domain Verification Techniques           April 2021


   what it is looking for (domain in the case of ACME, organization name
   + domain in case of GitHub) it can specifically do a DNS query for
   that TXT record, as opposed to having to do a TXT query for the apex.

   ACME does the same name construction for CNAME records.

3.3.2.  RDATA

   One pattern that quite a few providers follow (Dropbox, Atlassian) is
   constructing the rdata of the TXT DNS record in the form of
   "PROVIDER-SERVICE-domain-verification=" followed by the random value
   being checked for.  This is in accordance with [RFC1464] which
   mandates that attributes must be stored as key-value pairs.

4.  Recommendations

4.1.  Targeted Domain Verification

   The TXT record being used for domain verification is most commonly
   placed at the domain name being verified.  For example, if
   "example.com" is being verified, then the DNS TXT record will have
   "example.com" in the Name section.

   If many services are attempting to verify the domain name, many
   distinct TXT records end up being placed at that name.  There is no
   way to surgically query only the TXT record for a specific service,
   resulting in extra work for a verifying service to sift through the
   records for its own domain verification record.  In addition, since
   DNS Resource Record sets are treated atomically, all TXT records must
   be returned to the querier, which leads to a bloating of DNS
   responses.  This could cause truncation and expensive retrying over
   TCP.

   A better method is to place the TXT record at a subdomain of the
   domain being verified that is specially reserved for use by the
   application service in question.

4.2.  TXT vs CNAME

   TODO

Internet-Draft       Domain Verification Techniques           April 2021


4.3.  Continuous checking

   After domain verification is done, there is no need for the TXT or
   CNAME record to continue to exist as the existence of the domain
   verifying DNS record for a service only implies that a user with
   access to the service also has DNS control of the domain at the time
   the code was generated.  It should be safe to remove the verifying
   DNS record once the verification is done.  However, despite this,
   some services ask the record to exist in perpetuity
   [ATLASSIAN-VERIFY].

5.  Security Considerations

   DNSSEC [RFC4033] should be employed by the domain owner to protect
   against domain name spoofing.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
