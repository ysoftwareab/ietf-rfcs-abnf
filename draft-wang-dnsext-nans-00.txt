Abstract

   There is no way to indicate the negative answer of resource records
   (RR) with name and type other than QNAME and QTYPE. This memo
   proposes a method to inform the nonexistence of a given name and a
   given type.

1. Introduction

1.1. Current DNS Operation

   Negative answer for QNAME and QTYPE, which is categorised into
   "NXDOMAIN" and "NODATA", has been covered by the DNS specifications
   [RFC1035]. "Name Error" RCODE expresses the nonexistence of QNAME (or
   "NXDOMAIN"). And the combination of "No Error" RCODE and no RRs
   relevant to QNAME in the answer section indicates that the name is
   valid, for the given class, but are no records of the given type (or
   "NODATA").

1.2. Problem for Current DNS Operation of Negative Answers

   There are some applications or DNS extensions that require "glue" RRs
   with their names other than QNAME and QTYPE in the response. i.e., in
   order to get both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in a response, one "glue"
   proposal is to include AAAA RR as additional data in A responses and
   include A RR as additional data in AAAA responses. For this specific
   problem, no data answer for the glued RRs in the additional section
   is not distinguishable from the case that this "glue" proposal is not
   implemented by the name servers or resolvers. The difficulty is
   mainly due to the dependency of negative answer on RCODE, while RCODE
   only serves the answer for QNAME and QTYPE. In order to solve the
   problem, a new method of negative answer independent of RCODE is
   proposed.

2. Negative Answer Definitions

2.1. Negative Answer Data Format

   Negative answer is also categorised into two types "NXDOMAIN" and
   "NODATA".

   The four relevant fields are

   NAME TYPE CLASS RDATA

   Fields not mentioned are not important in terms of the negative
   answer.

   Negative answer of "NXDOMAIN" is

   NAME <empty> CLASS <empty>

   Negative answer of "NODATA" is

   NAME TYPE CLASS <empty>

2.2. Negative Answers from Authoritative Servers

   Name Servers authoritative for a zone MAY place the negative answer
   to names and types other than QNAME and QTYPE in the response (i.e.,
   in the additional section).  If so, name servers authoritative for a
   zone MUST include the SOA record of the zone in the response (i.e.,
   in the additional section). If needed, the appropriate NSEC RR SHOULD
   be included in the response [RFC5155] (i.e., in the additional
   section).

2.3. Caching Negative Answers

   Negative answer to names and types other than QNAME and QTYPE in the
   response MAY be cached as specified in [RFC2308 5].

3. Example

   The following example is based on the "glue" proposal mentioned in
   section 1.2. The response to the query for AN.EXAMPLE. AAAA MAY
   include the negative answer of AN.EXAMPLE. A in the additional
   section.

   Header:

   RDCODE=NOERROR

   Query:

   AN.EXAMPLE. AAAA

   Answer:

   <empty>

   Authority:

   EXAMPLE. SOA NS1.XX. HOSTMASTER.NS1.XX. ....

   EXAMPLE. NS NS1.XX.

   EXAMPLE. NS NS2.XX.

   Additional:

   NS1.XX. A 127.0.0.2

   NS2.XX. A 127.0.0.3

   AN.EXAMPLE. A

   The negative answer that resulted from a no data error (NODATA) of
   AN.EXAMPLE. A MAY be cache such that it can be retrieved and returned
   in response to another query for the same <QNAME, QTYPE, QCLASS> that
   resulted in the cached negative response.

4. Security Considerations

   TBD.

5. IANA Considerations

   TBD.
