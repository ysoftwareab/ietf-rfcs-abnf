                                Abstract

        This draft describes how one should make use of RTP (rfc1889)
        when employing layered media streams.  This document is meant
        for implementors of internet multimedia applications that want
        to use RTP and layered media streams.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Layered Multimedia Streams             March 1996


1 Introduction

This memorandum describes how to use RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol,
rfc1889) with layered multimedia streams.

2 Layered Video

Today, most multimedia applications place the responsibility of rate-adaptivity
at the source.  In multicast transmission, source-adaptation, as discussed in
[3], leads to the source not being to meet the conflicting bandwidth
requirements of the all receivers.  This usually leads to the least-common
denominator scenarios, where the smallest pipe in the network mesh dictates
the quality and fidelity of the overall live multimedia "broadcast".  If the
responsibility of rate-adaptation is placed at the receivers, then
heterogeneity of such media transmissions is achievable.

One approach for moving rate-adaptation from the source to the receivers
is to combine a layered source-coder with a layered transmission system.
In the context of IP Multicast, Deering proposed a realization of this
scheme where a source stripes the progressive layers of a hierarchically
represented signal across multiple multicast groups [2].  Receivers can
then adapt to network heterogeneity by controlling their reception
bandwidth through IP Multicast group membership.

In the case of video transmission, several approaches to the layered
source-coding problem have been explored, including multirate JPEG [4],
subband coding [6], and hierarchical vector quantization [1].

3 RTP Usage

The RTP specification [5] implicitly assumes that the underlying
transport/network layer is monolithic.  That is, a single
RTP session is carried on a single underlying communications
layer.  However, the layered transmission system described
above requires that the stream be partitioned across
multiple underlying transport end-points.

In RTP, each signal source is identified with a randomly allocated 32-bit
source identifier (SRCID) that is unique only within a single session
(a collision detection algorithm resolves conflicts).  Additionally, each
user is identified with a variable-length ``canonical name'' (CNAME) string
that is globally unique.  Data packets are identified only by SRCID, and
periodically, each application broadcasts a binding between it's CNAME and
SRCID.  Thus, a receiver can collate streams across different sessions
(identified by different SRCID's) using the level of indirection provided
by the CNAME.  Using this framework, we can readily handle layered
compression formats by treating each layer as a distinct ``RTP session''
and distributing it on its own multicast group.  This is the same approach

that the RTP uses to relate separate audio and video streams from a
single user.

However, the ``RTP session per layer'' approach adds unnecessary complexity.
Not only does it force each receiver to manage all the CNAME/SRCID bindings,
but it requires newly arrived receivers to wait for the binding advertisement
before they can start decoding a stream.  Another problem is that it creates
new error recovery conditions for dealing with conflicting information
arriving on the different sessions.

We propose to extend RTP semantics.  Our proposal is that a single SRCID
space is used across all layers and that the core (base) layer be used for
SRCID allocation and conflict resolution.  With regard to RTCP, we propose
that sender identification strings are redundant across all layers and
thus should only be transmitted on the base layer.

Other than the proposed semantics above, all other RTP rules and practices
apply.
