    Syntactic and Semantic Checks for Domain Validation Certificates
           draft-kent-trans-domain-validation-cert-checks-02

Abstract

   Certificate Transparency (CT) [RFC6962-bis] is a system for publicly
   logging the existence of X.509 certificates as they are issued or
   observed.  The logging mechanism allows anyone to audit certification
   authority (CA) activity and detect the issuance of "suspect"
   certificates.  Detecting mis-issuance of certificates is a primary
   goal of CT.

   A certificate is considered to be mis-issued if it fails to meet
   syntactic and/or semantic criteria associated with the type of
   certificate being issued.  Mis-issuance can be detected by CT log
   servers, whose feedback to a CA could prompt the CA to not issue a
   suspect certificate.  (Preventing the mis-issuance of such a
   certificate is preferable to issuing it and detecting it later.)

   Compliant CT log servers could offer these checks to a CA submitting
   a pre-certificate to be logged.  These checks are intended to be used
   in an environment in which CAs optionally assert the version of the
   EV guidelines to which the submitted pre-certificate purportedly
   conforms.  Log servers would then perform the checks of supported
   [CABF-DV] versions and include the CA's assertion and the log
   server's result in its Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT).

   Monitors can also perform checks to detect suspect certificates on
   behalf of certificate Subjects.  Checks performed by a Monitor also
   serve to double check log servers that claim to have checked a
   certificate, to identify those that are not doing the checks
   properly, e.g., because of errors, compromise, or conspiracy.  This
   provides Monitors and CT clients with additional information when
   choosing which logs to use.

Internet-Draft    Domain Validation Certificate Checks     December 2015


1.  Introduction

   The following checks are extracted from the CA Browser Forum (CABF)
   document "Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of
   Publicly-Trusted Certificates" version 1_2_3 [CABF-DV].  (If a new
   version of the CABF guidelines is created that alters any of the
   checks described below, a new CCID value MUST be assigned.)  These
   requirements are used to define what constitutes mis-issuance of a
   certificate in the context of certificate transparency (CT) for Web
   PKI certificates.  The CABF guidelines from which these checks are
   derived include many aspects of CA operation that are outside of the
   scope of CT-based detection of certificate mis-issuance, i.e., they
   impose requirements that could not be verified by a Monitor examining
   certificate logs.  Hence this document was created to provide an
   enumeration of DV certificate checks for the Web PKI CT context.

   The checks enumerated below are to be applied to any certificate
   submitted to a log with the Certificate Class ID (CCID) value of 1
   (see Section X of [CT RFC]).  Note that "root" CA certificates are
   not subject to verification against these criteria.  Each log
   maintains a list of the certificates of CAs (that MUST begin the
   certificate validation path) for which it is willing to accept SCT
   generation requests.  This implies that the log operator has already
   determined that these CAs, and their corresponding self-signed
   certificates, are acceptable.)  A subordinate CA certificate will be
   checked only if it is submitted as the target of an SCT.  If a
   subordinate CA certificate appears as part of a chain submitted for
   SCT generation, but is not the last certificate (the End-Entity or EE
   certificate) in that chain, the checks enumerated below are applied
   to the EE certificate but not the subordinate CA certificate.

   [CABF-DV] describes both syntactic and semantic requirements for
   certificate issuance.  This document deals primarily with syntactic
   checks, but also describes how semantic checks are to be performed.
   A log MAY perform the syntactic checks enumerated below if a
   certificate is submitted with a CCID value of 1.  If a log performs
   these syntactic checks, it adds the SSV value appropriate for the
   outcome of the check (see Section Z of [CT-RFC]) to the SCT.

   Monitors SHOULD perform both the syntactic and semantic checks
   described below for all certificates that they protect, and which are
   marked with a CCID value of 1.

2.  Syntactic Checks

   An X.509 certificate consists of a set of fields (all but two of
   which are mandatory), a set of optional extensions, a public key and
   a signature.  This section defines the syntactic requirements imposed

   on the certificate fields.  The following sections deal with
   extensions, public keys, and signatures.

2.1.  DV Certificate Field Syntax Requirements

   1.   Version number: The certificate MUST be an X.509 v3 certificate.
        This requirement is derived from Appendix B of [CABF-DV], where
        it is explicitly stated for Root and Subordinate CA
        certificates.  Since other portions of [CABF-DV] mandate support
        for extensions and only v3 certificates can contain extensions
        [RC5280], this requirement is inferred to apply to EE
        certificates as well.

   2.   serialNumber: No requirements beyond those imposed by [RFC5280]
        are mandated by [CABF-DV].  Section 9.6 of [CABF-DV] suggests
        that a serial number contain at least 20 bits of entropy so the
        minimum serialNumber length should be 20 bits.

   3.   signature: For any certificate issued after December 31, 2010,
        the allowed digest algorithms are: SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384 or
        SHA-512.  If RSA is used to sign the certificate, the minimum
        modulus size is 2048 bits.  (No requirement is imposed on the
        public exponent.)  If DSA is used to sign the certificate, the
        following pairs of values are permitted: L= 2048, N= 224 or L=
        2048, N=256).  If the certificate signature is based on ECC
        (presumably ECDSA), the allowed curves are NIST P-256, P-384 and
        P-521.  To verify that a certificate employs an accepted digest
        and signature algorithm, one examines the OID contained in this
        field.  OIDs defined in the following RFCs are applicable here:
        [RFC4055], [RFC5480], and [RFC5758].  (This set of checks does
        not apply to certificates issued before the date cited above.)

   4.   issuer: The Issuer name MUST contain the countryName attribute
        and it MUST contain an ISO-3166-1 country code.  This
        requirement is derived from section 9.1.4 of [CABF-DV].  The
        Issuer name MUST contain the organizationName attribute.  This
        requirement is derived from section 9.1.3 of [CABF-DV].

   5.   validity: An EE certificate issued after July 1, 2012 MUST not
        contain a validity interval longer than 60 months.  ([CABF-DV]
        establishes criteria in Section 9.4.1 that describe the
        circumstances under which EE certificates may be issued with
        validity intervals between 39 and 60 months.  Since these
        criteria cannot be evaluated without external knowledge, this
        RFC adopts the 60-month limit for syntactic checking.)

   6.   subject: A certificate MAY contain a NULL Subject name.  If it
        contains a non-null Subject name:

        A.  it MAY contain a commonName attribute.  If this attribute is
            present, it MUST contain a single IP address or Fully-
            Qualified Domain Name that is one of the values contained in
            the Certificate's subjectAltName extension.  This
            requirement is derived from section 9.2.2 of [CABF-DV].
            Thus verification of this attribute requires comparing
            values in this attribute against the content of the
            subjectAltName extension, which MUST be present (see below).

        B.  it MAY contain an organizationalUnitName attribute.  This
            requirement is derived from section 9.2.6 of [CABF-DV].

        C.  if the name does not contain an organizationName attribute,
            then the streetAddress attribute MUST NOT be present.  If
            the organizationName attribute is present, the streetAddress
            attribute MAY be present.  This requirement is derived from
            section 9.2.4b of [CABF-DV].

        D.  if the name does not contain an organizationName attribute,
            then the localityName attribute MUST NOT be present.  If the
            organizationName attribute is present, the localityName
            attribute MAY be present.  This requirement is derived from
            section 9.2.4c of [CABF-DV].

        E.  if the name does not contain an organizationName attribute,
            then the stateOrProvinceName attribute MUST NOT be present.
            If the organizationName attribute is present, and the
            localityName is absent, then the stateOrProvinceName
            attribute MUST be present.  If the organizationName
            attribute is present, and the localityName is present, then
            the stateOrProvinceName attribute MAY be present.  This
            requirement is derived from section 9.2.4d of [CABF-DV].

        F.  if the name does not contain an organizationName attribute,
            then the postalCode attribute MUST NOT be present.  If the
            name contains an organizationName attribute, then the
            postalCode attribute MAY be present.  This requirement is
            derived from section 9.2.4e of [CABF-DV].

        G.  if the name contains an organizationName attribute, then the
            countryName attribute MUST be present.  If the name does not
            contain an organizationName attribute, then the countryName
            attribute MAY be present.  This requirement is derived from
            section 9.2.5 of [CABF-DV].

        H.  The Subject MAY contain other attributes as specified in
            Appendix A of [RFC5280].  These attributes MUST NOT contain

            metadata such as '.', '-', or ' ' (i.e. space) characters.
            This requirement is derived from section 9.2.8 of [CABF-DV].

   7.   subjectPublicKeyInfo: If this field contains an RSA public key
        the minimum modulus size is 2048 bits.  (No requirement is
        imposed on the public exponent.)  If it carries a DSA key, the
        following pairs of values are permitted: L= 2048, N= 224 or L=
        2048, N=256.  If the field conveys an ECC (presumably ECDSA)
        public key, the allowed curves are NIST P-256, P-384 and P-521.
        To verify that a certificate employs an accepted digest and
        signature algorithm, one examines the OID contained in this
        field.  OIDs defined in the following RFCs are applicable here:
        [RFC4055], [RFC5480], and [RFC5758].

   8.   issuerUniqueId: This is an optional field (a BIT STRING) in a v3
        certificate.  [CABF-DV] imposes no requirements on this field,
        so no constraints beyond those in [RFC5280] are applicable.

   9.   subjectUniqueId: This is an optional field (a BIT STRING) in a
        v3 certificate.  [CABF-DV] imposes no requirements on this
        field, so no constraints beyond those in [RFC5280] are
        applicable.

   10.  signatureAlgorithm: This field MUST match the signature field
        contained within the certificate (see # 3 above).

   11.  signatureValue: This field is verified using the public key
        extracted from the certificate of the Issuer of this
        certificate, and the algorithms specified in the preceding
        field.

2.2.  DV Certificate Extension Syntax Requirements

   An X.509 v3 certificate may contain extensions.  [CABF-DV] mandates
   the presence of several extensions, and imposes requirements on their
   content.

   1.  The certificate MUST contain the subjectAltName extension, and
       that extension MUST contain at least one entry.  Each entry MUST
       be either a dNSName containing a Fully-Qualified Domain Name
       (FQDN) or an iPAddress.  Wildcard FQDNs are permitted.  No other
       entry types are permitted.  This requirement is derived from
       section 9.2.1 of [CABF-DV].

   2.  A certificate issued to a CA MUST include the certificatePolicies
       extension.  It MAY or MAY NOT be marked CRITICAL.  The
       policyQualifiers field MAY be present, and the policyQualifierId
       and/or the cPSuri fields may be populated, using the syntax



Kent & Andrews            Expires June 24, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    Domain Validation Certificate Checks     December 2015


       specified in [RFC5280].  This requirement is derived from
       Appendix B, Section 3.A of [CABF-DV].

       A.  If this extension contains the OID 2.23.140.1.2.1, then the
           Subject field MUST NOT contain an organizationName,
           streetAddress, localityName, stateOrProvinceName, or
           postalCode attribute.  This requirement is derived from
           section 9.3.1 of [CABF-DV].

       B.  If this extension contains the OID 2.23.140.1.2.2, then the
           Subject field MUST contain organizationName, localityName,
           and countryName attributes.  This requirement is derived from
           section 9.3.1 of [CABF-DV].  ([CABF-DV] also states that the
           stateOrProvinceName attribute MUST be present, "if
           applicable".  Since the applicability of this attribute
           cannot be readily determined, this Appendix views the
           presence of this attribute as optional.)

   3.  The basicConstraints extension MUST be present, marked CRITICAL
       and the cA flag MUST be set TRUE in a CA certificate.  This
       requirement is derived from Appendix B Section 2.D of [CABF-DV].
       The presence of this extension is optional for an EE certificate.
       If the extension is present in an EE certificate it MUST have the
       cA flag set to FALSE.  (If a certificate does not contain this
       extension it is presumed to be an EE certificate and MUST be
       processed as such with regard to all other verification checks.)

   4.  The cRLDistributionPoints extension MUST be present in a CA
       certificate.  It MUST NOT be marked critical and it MUST contain
       an HTTP URL.  This extension is optional for EE certificates, but
       if present the same syntactic constraints apply.  This
       requirement is derived from Appendix B, Sections 2.B and 3.B of
       [CABF-DV].

   5.  The keyUsage extension MUST be present in a CA certificate and it
       MUST be marked critical.  The keyCertSign and cRLSign bits MUST
       be set.  The digitalSignature bit MAY be set as well.  The
       keyUsage extension MAY be present in an EE certificate.  If it is
       present in an EE certificate, the keyCertSign and cRLSign bits
       MUST NOT be set.  These requirements are derived from Appendix B,
       Section 2.E of [CABF-DV].

   6.  The authorityInformationAccess extension MAY be present and, if
       present, MUST NOT be marked CRITICAL and MUST contain
       accessMethod 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1 and MAY specify accessMethod
       1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2.  This requirement is derived from Appendix B,
       Sections 2.C and 3.C of [CABF-DV].

Internet-Draft    Domain Validation Certificate Checks     December 2015


   7.  The extKeyUsage extension MAY be present in a CA certificate.  If
       present, it need not be marked CRITICAL.  If the extension is
       present in a CA certificate, and if the certificate contains the
       nameConstraints extension, then the value id-kp-serverAuth MUST
       be present.  This requirement is derived from Section 9.7 and
       Appendix B, Section 2.G of [CABF-DV].  The extKeyUsage extension
       MUST be present in an EE certificate.  Either the value id-kp-
       serverAuth or id-kp-clientAuth or both values MUST be present.
       id-kp-emailProtection MAY be present.  This requirement is
       derived from Appendix B, Section 3.F of [CABF-DV].

   8.  The nameConstraints extension MAY appear in CA certificates and
       need not be marked CRITICAL (contrary to [RFC5280]).  If the
       certificate also contains the extKeyUsage extension and that
       extension contains the value id-kp-serverAuth, then that
       extension MUST NOT contain the anyExtendedKeyUsage value in the
       KeyPurposeId.  Moreover, the nameConstraints extension MUST
       impose constraints on dNSName, iPAddress and DirectoryName name
       types.  Both the permittedSubtrees and excludedSubtrees fields
       MAY be employed.  This requirement is derived from Section 9.7
       and Appendix B, Section 2.F of [CABF-DV].

   9.  Other extensions defined in [RFC5280] MAY be present and MUST be
       marked with respect to criticality as specified therein.

2.3.  Certificate Public Key

2.3.1.  RSA Public Keys

   1.  If a subordinate CA certificate contains an RSA public key, and
       the certificate has a validity period beginning on or before 31
       Dec 2010 and ending on or before 31 Dec 2013, that key MUST have
       a minimum modulus size of 1024 bits.  If a subordinate CA
       certificate contains an RSA public key, and the certificate has a
       validity period beginning after 31 Dec 2010 or ending after 31
       Dec 2013, that key MUST have a minimum modulus size of 2048 bits.
       This requirement is derived from Appendix A (2) of [CABF-DV].

   2.  If an EE certificate contains an RSA public key, and the
       certificate has a validity period ending on or before 31 Dec
       2013, that key MUST have a minimum modulus size of 1024 bits.  If
       an EE certificate contains an RSA public key, and the certificate
       has a validity period ending after 31 Dec 2013, that key MUST
       have a minimum modulus size of 2048 bits.  This requirement is
       derived from Appendix A (3) of [CABF-DV].

Internet-Draft    Domain Validation Certificate Checks     December 2015


   3.  The value of the public exponent of an RSA public key MUST be an
       odd number equal to 3 or more.  This requirement is derived from
       Appendix A (4) of [CABF-DV].

2.3.2.  DSA Public Keys

   1.  If a certificate contains a DSA public key, the minimum modulus
       and divisor size (in bits) MUST be L= 2048, N= 224 or L= 2048, N=
       256.  This requirement is derived from Appendix A (2) and (3) of
       [CABF-DV].

   2.  If a certificate contains a DSA public key, the public key MUST
       include all domain parameters.  This requirement is derived from
       Appendix A (4) of [CABF-DV].

2.3.3.  ECC Public Keys

   1.  If a certificate contains an ECC public key, that key MUST employ
       one of these curves: NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521.  This
       requirement is derived from Appendix A (2) and (3) of [CABF-DV].

2.4.  Certificate Signature

   The certificate's signatureAlgorithm MUST be SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384
   or SHA-512.  This requirement is derived from Appendix A (2) and (3)
   of [CABF-DV].

3.  Semantic Verification of a DV Certificate

   The fundamental semantic check that a Monitor MUST perform is to
   detect bogus certificates on behalf of its clients.  A client of a
   Monitor provides the Monitor with a set of certificates that have
   been issued to the client.  (Note that a client may have multiple
   certificates issued to its name, and thus there is not a one-to-one
   mapping between names and public keys.)  These certificates MUST be
   acquired in a secure fashion, not using certificate discovery
   protocols or relying on databases operated by a CA or RA.  Armed with
   this information, a Monitor can examine every log entry to determine
   if it contains the same Subject or subjectAltName as that of a
   client.  If a log entry matches either of these names, and if it
   contains a public key other than the one(s) provided by the Subject,
   this is evidence of mis-issuance.  A Monitor SHOULD track activity in
   all logs that are considered trustworthy by its clients.  There is no
   mechanism defined that allows a Monitor to know what logs belong to
   this set.  Thus it is RECOMMENDED that each Monitor make known the
   set of logs that it tracks, and each client is advised to select a
   Monitor that satisfies the client's criteria in this regard.  If a
   Monitor identifies what appears to be a bogus certificate, it

   notifies the client.  The means by which notification is effected is
   not specified.

   [CABF-DV] imposes a number of requirements on certificate issuance
   that cannot be verified without access to reference information for
   the certificate Subject, information about the CA hierarchy, or
   information about internal procedures of the CA.  Monitors are not
   presumed to be able to perform such checks.  Examples of such checks
   appear in Sections 7.1, 9.1.3, 9.1.4, 9.2.4a, 9.2.6, 9.4.1 and 9.5 of
   [CABF-DV].

   Additional semantic checks SHOULD be performed by a Monitor, if it
   has access to the requisite information.  These are enumerated below.

   1.  A certificate issued to a subordinate CA that is not an affiliate
       of a "root" CA MUST NOT contain the anyPolicy policy identifier.
       This requirement is derived from section 9.3.3 of [CABF-DV].
       Verification of this requirement requires knowledge of CA
       organizational relationships and thus may not be available to all
       Monitors.

   2.  A certificate issued to a subordinate CA that is an affiliate of
       a "root" CA MAY include one or more explicit policy identifiers
       (either 2.23.140.1.2.1 or 2.23.140.1.2.2 or policy identifiers
       defined by the CA in its CP and/or CPS).  It also MAY include the
       anyPolicy OID.  This requirement is derived from section 9.3.3 of
       [CABF-DV].  If the extension contains any of the OIDs noted
       explicitly above, it is acceptable.  Verification of this
       requirement requires knowledge of CA organizational relationships
       and thus may not be available to all Monitors.
