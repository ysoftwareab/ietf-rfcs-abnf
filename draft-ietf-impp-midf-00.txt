2 Abstract

   This document specifies a [MIME] format for instant messages.

3 Introduction

   This document specifies a [MIME] format for instant messages.

   Section 7.1.8 of [IMPP-REQTS] specifies that the format of instant
   message bodies should be based on [MIME]. This document formalizes
   that usage.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [MUSTS].

4 Instant message format

   An INSTANT MESSAGE, as defined in Section 4 of [IMPP-MODEL], MUST be
   a [MIME] message. This is not to say that it will use all the headers
   of [822]; the delivery headers required (and allowed) will be defined
   by [IMPP-MITP].

5 Open questions

   o Which [MIME] headers defined since RFCs 2045-2049 do we want to

Stracke                                                     [Page 1]

INTERNET-DRAFT                    MIDF                  December 3, 1999

     include?
   o Do we want to borrow any headers from [HTTP]? For example,
     Content-Encoding could be very useful.

6 Internationalization Considerations

   This proposal builds on [MIME], and has all the same
   internationalization capabilities, particularly those in [MIME-I18N].

7 IANA Considerations

   This proposal does not introduce any new IANA considerations.

8 Security Considerations

   This proposal does not introduce any new security considerations over
   those in [MIME].

   The following notice is copied from RFC-2026 [Bradner, 1996], section
   10.4, and describes the position of the IETF concerning intellectual
   property claims made against this document.

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any

   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it

   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11. Copies of
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of
   licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to
   obtain a general license or permission for the use of such
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification can
   be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice
   this standard. Please address the information to the IETF Executive
   Director.

   The IMPP working group had agreed on MIME by the time I started
   participating; I'm just the one who volunteered to write it up.
