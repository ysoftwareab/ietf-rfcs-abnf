Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based security management of CableHome 1.0 compliant residential 
   gateway devices.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
   SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP
   framework and existing SNMP standards.

   This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet
   Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be
   addressed to the working group's mailing list at ipcdn@terayon.com
   and/or the author.

1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
       16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].  The
       second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
       [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
       message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC

       1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is called
       SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574
       [12].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
       operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
       [13].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
       the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
       [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine

Internet Draft           Cable Gateway Security MIB          October 2002

   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2.  Glossary

   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable
   system usage, or from the documents associated with the CableHome
   Specification process.
   
2.1.  Cable Gateway Device
    A cable gateway device passes data traffic between the cable
    operator's broadband data network (the Wide Area Network, WAN) and
    the Local Area Network (LAN) in the cable data service subscriber's
    residence or business. In addition to passing traffic between the 
    WAN and LAN, the cable gateway device provides several services
    including a DHCP client and a DHCP server [RFC2131], a TFTP server
    [RFC1350], management services as enabled by SNMPv1/v2c/v3 agent 
    compliant with the RFCs listed in Section 1, and security services
    including stateful packet inspection firewall functionality and 
    software code image verification using techniques described in 
    [RFC3280].
    

2.2  Portal Services (PS)
   A logical element aggregating the set of CableHome-specified 
   functionality in a CableHome compliant cable gateway device. The 
   Portal Services set of functions is described in [16].

2.3.  Denial of Service
   
   A type of attack on a network that is designed to bring the 
   network to its knees by flooding it with useless traffic.

2.4.  Firewall

   A system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a 
   private network.  Firewalls are frequently used to prevent 
   unauthorized Internet users from accessing private networks connected 
   to the Internet.


2.5.  Hash

   A hash value (or simply hash) is a number generated from a string of 
   text. The hash is substantially smaller than the text itself, and is 
   generated by a formula in such a way that it is extremely unlikely 
   that some other text will produce the same hash value. Hashes play a 
   role in security systems where they're used to ensure that transmitted 
   messages have not been tampered with.

2.6.  Rule Set

   The rule set is derived from the security policy and defines the 
   collection of access control rules (filter and proxy action rules) which 
   
Jones                      Expires April 2003                 [Page 4]

Internet Draft           Cable Gateway Security MIB          October 2002

   then determines which packets the firewall forwards and which it rejects.


2.7.  Security Policy

   The security policy defines the desired level of security/functionality 
   for a subscriber's firewall.

3.  Overview

   This MIB provides a set of security objects required for the management 
   of CableHome compliant residential gateway devices.  The specification 
   is derived from the CableHome 1.0 specification [1].  

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [17].

3.1.  Management requirements

3.1.1.  Firewall Enable

   The cabhSecFwPolicyFileEnable object enables or disables firewall
   rule set filtering functions.

3.1.2.  Firewall Configuration File Download

   The firewall configuration file download process is documented in
   [16].  From a network management station, the operator:

      -   sets cabhSecFwPolicyFileHash to the hash value calculated
          using the firewall configuration file.

      -   sets cabhSecFwPolicyFileURL to the name and IP address of the
          firewall configuratrion file using TFTP URL format.  When this
          value changes, it triggers the file download.

   Download status and the version of the firewall configuration file
   can be obtained from the cabhSecFwPolicyFileOperStatus and 
   cabhSecFwPolicyCurrentVersion MIB objects.

3.1.3  Firewall Event Management

   There are three types of firewall events that can be logged.  The
   following objects allow the operator to enable or disable the logging
   of these events:

      - cabhSecFwEventType1Enable controls the logging of Type 1 event 
        messages which indicate attempts from both private and public 
        clients to traverse the firewall that violate the security policy.

      - cabhSecFwEventType2Enable controls the logging of Type 2 event 
        messages which indicate the detection of Denial-of-Service attacks.

Internet Draft           Cable Gateway Security MIB          October 2002

      - cabhSecFwEventType3Enable controls the logging of Type 3 event
        messages which indicate changes in firewall management parameters.
  
   Event messaging details are documented in [16].

3.1.4  Firewall Attack Alert

   The Firewall Attack Alert MIB objects enable an MSO to be notified when
   a firewall as been attacked a certain number of times within a given
   period.  

   The cabhSecFwEventAttackAlertThreshold object is set with the number of
   Type 1 or Type 2 hacker attacks that are allowed within the time period
   defined by cabhSecFwEventAttackAlertPeriod.  If the total number of
   attacks exceed this number an event message MUST be logged.

   The cabhSecFwEventAttackAlertPeriod object indicates the period to be 
   used (in hours) for the  cabhSecFwEventAttackAlertThreshold. This MIB 
   variable should always keep track of the last  x hours of events meaning 
   that if the variable is set to track events for 10 hours then when the 
   11th hour is reached, the 1st hour of events is deleted from the 
   tracking log. A default value is set to zero, meaning zero time, so that 
   this MIB variable will not track any events unless configured.
     
3.1.5  PS Certificate

   The cabhSecCertPsCert provides the ability to read the certificate 
   information in a compliant CableHome residential gateway device. The
   PS certicate is used to in the process to authenticate the device.
