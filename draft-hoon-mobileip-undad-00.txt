Abstract

   The Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure detailed by Neighbor
   Discovery Protocol (NDP) requires nodes to wait for a quantified time
   interval during which the configured address is checked for
   duplication in the connected link. This delay affects normal
   communication in a Mobile Node (MN) during the DAD time interval
   thereby hampering Fast Handoff. The expected use of Mobile IP on a
   wide scale and the need for a minimal time delay during the handoff
   process require alternate mechanisms for overcoming the DAD time

   interval. This draft presents a mechanism wherein the Access Router's
   (AR) Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) is used to minimize the delay
   associated with the DAD procedure.

1. Introduction

   Mobile Nodes receive Router Advertisements (RAs) from the access
   routers when they roam into a foreign network. These RAs carry the
   prefix information of the subnet which the MN uses to configure its
   Care of Address (COA)[2]. The MN is then expected to perform normal
   DAD on the connected link to ascertain the uniqueness of the COA.
   This DAD time interval is expected to last a minimum of 1000ms during
   which time all existing communication with the MN are paused. Only
   after completion of the DAD time interval does the MN begin the Home
   registration process[3]. The DAD time interval can significantly
   influence the time a Mobile Node takes for Handoff thereby requiring
   alternate mechanisms to minimize it.

   In this document, we propose a scheme of using the Neighbor Cache
   Entries (NCE) of the access router for an efficient DAD process.
   Access Routers are required to perform additional functionalities in
   order to maintain the complete list of nodes present in the subnet in
   their Neighbor Cache. Mobile Nodes on detecting movement into a new
   subnet query the Access Router about the uniqueness of the care of
   address. The Access Routers check the Neighbor Cache for any matching
   information and respond to the mobile nodes query. This method of
   using the Neighbor Cache of the access router can support fast
   hand-off by reducing DAD delay time.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", "OPTIONAL", and
   "silently ignore" in this document are to be interpreted as described

   The following terminology and abbreviations are used in this
   document.

      Access Router (AR)

      -  Mobile node's default router which forwards IP packets not
         explicitly addressed to itself.

      Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE)

      -  A set entries about individual neighbors to which traffic has
         been sent recently.

      Duplicate address detection (DAD)

      -  Before the link-local address be assigned to an interface and
         used, however, a node must attempt to verify that this
         "tentative" address is not already used by some node on the
         connected link.

3. Requirements for using Neighbor Cache Entry in mobile ipv6

   Following subsections list the minimum set of requirements for
   efficient DAD protocol.

3.1 Mobile Node's requirement

   -  A mobile node should request the access router to verify the
      uniqueness of its IP address by sending a DAD NS.

   -  A mobile node should assign the Care of Address to its interface,
      as soon as it receives NA from access router after sending NS for
      DAD.


3.2 AR's requirement

   -  Access routers should accept and process all NS with unspecified
      source address and solicited-node-multicast destination address
      for DAD.

   -  Access router should compare the target address in the received
      DAD NS message with the Neighbor cache entries to detect
      duplication.

   -  Access routers on determining that the target address is not
      present in the NC should create a new NC entry for the target
      address.

   -  Access router should reply to the sender which has sent NS message
      with the 'A' bit set in the 4th reserved field in NA if access
      router has no entry corresponding to the target address.

4. Protocol operation

   This section describes our protocol operation in detail.

4.1 Mobile node's operation

   A mobile node creates a new CoA with the prefix advertised by the
   access router when it moves to foreign network. The mobile node then
   MUST send the modified DAD NS message to the solicited node multicast
   address for DAD procedure before assigning the address to the
   interface.

   The modified NS message is sent with the reserved field bit set and
   the mobile node waits for a NA message either from the access router
   or from some other node in the same network configured with the same
   address.

    1) NA message from access router. - The target address in this NA
      message form access router is the target address sent by the
      Mobile node in its NS message. The 'A' bit is set in the message
      to indicate the address's uniqueness. The 'A' bit is used to
      indicate that the Access Router has no NCE corresponding to the
      target address sent by the mobile node. On receipt of the modified
      NA message the mobile node can send an unsolicited NA message to
      the Access router to provide the MAC address.

    2) NA message from existing node. - The mobile node can also receive
      a NA message from another node in the network with the same
      address prior to receiving the NA message from the router. In this
      case the mobile node should use some other mechanism to configure
      its address.

   If the mobile node does not receive NA messages from either the
   Access Router or some other existing node then it has to wait for
   atleast 1000ms before it can configure the address to its interface.

4.2 Access Router's operation

   The Access router is required to provide additional functionality in
   terms of maintaining the addresses of all the connected nodes in the
   link. The access router achieves this by listening to all DAD packets
   in the network.

   The above NS message is sent with solicited-node-multicast
   destination address(FF02:0:0:0:0:1:FFXX:XXXX) and Ethernet multicast
   destination address whose first two octets are the value 3333
   hexadecimal and whose last four octets are the last four octets of
   destination address. A access router can receive all DAD packet by

   monitoring the fixed octets (FF02:0:0:0:0:1:FF, 3333 hexadecimal) of
   solicited-node-multicast destination address and Ethernet multicast
   destination address.

   Once the access router receives a DAD NS message with the A bit set
   it looks up its NC to determine if an entry is already present. If an
   entry is not present then it sends out a NA message with the A bit
   set. It also creates a new entry in its NC with the target address of
   the NS message.

6. Security Considerations

   This draft introduces no security risks in addition to those that are
   already present in the underlying protocols. However, due
   consideration has to be given to the fact that a malicious node also
   can receive all NS messages for DAD. It can then send out NA messages
   causing the DAD of the mobile node to fail. If a malicious node sends
   NS messages with different target address continuously, the access
   router will create NCEs which will hamper a mobile nodes hand off.
   The access routers can be provided with a NCE maintenance process to
   detect such problems if it exists in the sub-network.
