Abstract

   This document discusses methods available for an LDAP server to
   discover other LDAP servers.  It is based on previous and ongoing
   IETF work.

1. Introduction

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [1] can be used to
   build "islands" of servers that are not a priori tied into a single
   Directory Information Tree (DIT.) Here, it is necessary to determine
   how an LDAP server can discover the existence of other LDAP servers.
   This documents discusses the methods available based on current and
   previous IETF work.

INTERNET DRAFT  LDAP Servers Finding Other LDAP Servers    November 1997


2. Server Discovery of Other Servers

   An LDAP server discovers other LDAP servers by either using a
   proposed naming scheme and the DNS or by using an additional server
   to server indexing protocol.  Once a server discovers other servers
   it can collect information for returning LDAP v3 referrals (as LDAP
   URLs) to clients.

2.1. Discovery via DNS

   An LDAP server may either be registered using SRV records [2] or, if
   the server uses the "dc-naming" scheme ([3, 4]), it can attempt to
   find the server managing its parent node by using DNS to look for the
   LDAP server for the parent domain. Additionally, an LDAP server may
   be named using a common alias as described in [5].  In either case,
   it is necessary to include information about the root of the LDAP
   server's subtree by using DNS TXT records as discussed in [6].

   As an example, consider a server with the RDN "dc=foo,dc=bar,dc=com"
   (i.e. in domain foo.bar.com).  To find its parent server, it would
   first look for a SRV record for ldap.tcp.bar.com and then follow [5]
   by looking for ldap.bar.com.  If any of these records were found, it
   would then look for a TXT record for the same domain to determine the
   root of its parent server's sub-tree.

2.2. Discovery via the Common Indexing Protocol [7, 8]

   Independent of what DIT is being managed, LDAP servers could export
   index information about their portion of the tree via the Common
   Indexing Protocol.  This requires some a priori discovery and set up
   of the index mesh and the inclusion of the root DN of the server's
   portion of the tree in the exported index information.

3. Security Considerations

   Since this draft only summarizes available methods, it adds no
   additional security considerations to those inherent in the
   referenced documents.  Implementors are strongly recommended to read
   and follow the security considerations provided in the referenced
   documents.
