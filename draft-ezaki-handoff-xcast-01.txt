Abstract:

For a handoff action using the mobile IPv6, we need two functions: 
re-routing on the wired region of the network and the activation of the 
air-link on the wireless region. In this architecture, a possibility of 
small break for a session is still large by the signaling overhead between 
Home Agent and Mobile Node (MN). We propose a new handoff method using the 
Explicit Multicast (xcast) technique. On the wired section, control/user 
packets are multicasted by xcast scheme to the Base Stations where MN can 
receive, then packets are passed to the air-link activated between a BS 
and the MN.


1. Introduction

In this draft, we propose another fast or smooth handoff method using the 
Small Group Multicast (SGM) / explicit multicast (xcast) technique.

In Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)[1], a Mobile Node (MN) sends a Binding Update (BU) 
packet to his Home Agent (HA) to modify the Binding Cache in the HA. Packets 
from Correspondent Node (CN) are encapsulated at the HA and tunneled to 
the MN. Recently, fast handoff or smooth handoff method called hierarchical 
MIPv6 (HMIPv6) using multiple layer and sub-HA called Mobility Anchor Point 
(MAP) are proposed [2]. It has an advantage of decreasing the load of HA, 
because the MAP hides the micro-movement of the MN in his layer. However, 
decapsulation and re-encapsulation on the MAP or a complex handover 
sequences are still needed.

The complexity of current MIPv6 or HMIPv6 comes from the basic restriction 
that a packet from the CN must NOT duplicate over the network (e.g. CN-HA-MN). 
In the mobile communication, the resource for the air-link is still 
important, whereas resource on wired network becomes sufficient since the 
development of the transport equipment (e.g. WDM) is distinctive. Actual 
MIPv6/HMIPv6 handoff procedure involves two type of the function: 
re-routing on the wired region of the network and the activation of the 
air-link on the wireless region. A cellular phone service achieves fast 
hand off scheme and saving of mobility administration table on Home Location 
Register (HLR) using the zone calling up technique for multiple cells [9]. 
Introducing the same idea, simple and fast handoff can be achieved on Mobile 
IP by multicasting the packet from HA. Low delay and no packet loss can 
be realized by the MN to select some BSs which receive the packet with the 
best condition.

Several handoff methods using multicast are proposed [9, 10, 11]. They 
describe that smooth handoff by multicast is effective in reducing datagram 
transmission latency, simplifying the intermediate routers logic and 
saving bandwidth of the wired network. However, in the past, it could not 
be achieved because using a classical multicast technique (e.g. DVMRP, PIM), 
it is difficult to maintain the large number of multicast group and routing 
spanning tree. These handoff methods transmit the datagrams for each MN 
by multicast. That means the base multicast system is required to support 
same number of multicast groups as that of MNs. And delivery trees of each 
multicast address must be frequently changed in order to trace a movement 
of each MN. It also costs expensive to set each of the group that has an 
only few destinations.

In this draft, first we introduce the SGM/Xcast technique which supplements 
a classical multicast, including standardization status. Since Xcast has 
some characteristics that intermediate routers forward multicast datagrams 
only by unicast routing information, xcast supports huge number of restless 
multicast groups that is necessary for handoff.

We propose the fast handoff method for MIPv6 by SGM/Xcast with few 
modifications to the MIPv6 architecture. This handoff mechanism provides 
mobility in heterogeneous media environment because this handoff mechanism 
is basically able to implemented without additional control or intelligence 
of neither intermediate routers nor Mobility Access Point (MAP).


2. Overview of Small Group Multicast

Multicast technique is important for the broadcast application, 
many-to-many video conference, or the advertisement of the router 
information. Using a group (class D) address, many protocols have been 
proposed and experimented. However, present multicast technique has some 
problems that it requires a state management for each group address. 
Recently, a BoF has been established to study the multicast technique for 
small group on IPv4/IPv6 environment without a complex routing protocol 
[7]. For a large number of small group communications, Small Group Multicast 
(SGM) scheme will be suitable. SGM is based on the 'Xcast' (explicit 
multicast) technique meaning that the every datagram includes all the 
addresses to deliver on the header of the packet. 

There are several experimental variant protocols [5] proposed in SGM/xcast 
BoF. Recently, unified specification for Xcast has been published [13]. 
We introduce a summary of the spec. in the next section.


2.1 Xcast overview

Xcast is multicast delivery mechanism that depends only on the existing 
unicast routing environment. The destination of a multicast datagram is 
specified by a list of unicast addresses instead of a group multicast 
address. Xcast is available for IPv4 or IPv6 environment with slightly 
modifying the header format. For IPv6 datagram, a destination list is stored 
in an IPv6 routing extension header with a bitmap that represents the 
destinations to send. For example, suppose that node A is trying to get 
packets distributed to B, C and D in Figure 2.1 below:


                                   R4 ---- B
                                  /
                                 /
        A----- R1 ---- R2 ---- R3                      R8 ---- C
                                 \                    /
                                  \                  /
                                   R5 ---- R6 ---- R7
                                                    \
                                                     \
                                                       R9 ---- D

		Figure 2.1 Sample network


This is accomplished as follows: A sends an Xcast packet with the list of 
destinations in its Xcast header to the first router, R1. Ignoring the 
details, the packet that A sends to R1 looks like this:

       [ src = A | dest = B C D | payload ] .

When R1 receives this packet, it needs to process the Xcast  header as 
follows:

   - Perform a route table lookup to determine the next hop for each of
   the destinations listed in the packet.

   - Partition the set of destinations based on their next hops.

   - Replicate the packet so that there's one copy of the packet for
   each of the next hops found in the previous steps.

   - Modify the list of destinations in each of the copies so that the
   list in the copy for a given next hop includes just the destinations
   that ought to be routed through that next hop.

   - Send the modified copies of the packet on to the next hops.

   - Optimization: If there is only one destination for a particular
   next hop, send the packet as a standard unicast packet to the
   destination (X2U).

So, in the example above, R1 will send a single packet on to R2 with a 
destination list of < B C D > and R2 will send a single packet to R3 with 
the same destination list. The following routers forward the Xcast packet 
with performing the same process.

Since routers can branch and forward the Xcast datagram only by unicast
routing table, it has a good scalability concerning with the number of
multicast group that is necessary for our handoff.

The format of the Xcast6 (Xcast for IPv6) datagram is

[IPv6 header | Xcast6 header | transport header | payload ].

Detail formats of these headers are explained in [13].


3. Fast handoff extension for Mobile IPv6 by Xcast

In this section, we describe the fast handoff extension for Mobile IPv6 
(MIPv6) [1] using Xcast technique. Now, we assume that a Mobile Node (MN) 
moves from area 1 to area 4 for a network model shown in Fig.3.1.

COA:     COA#1     COA#2     COA#3     COA#4

	Figure 3.1: Example of a mobile network


Mobile Node (MN) detects his movement by receiving a Routing advertisement 
from a router, then he generates his Care-of-Address (COA) with a stateless 
or a stateful address allocating procedure. MN sends this information to 
his Home Agent (HA) by a Binding Update (BU) message. HA modifies the 
information on the address entry in his Binding Cache and returns a Binding 
Acknowledgement (BAck) message to MN. Packets from a Correspondent Node 
(CN) or the other node to the shadow of the Home Address of MN are blocked 
by the HA and are tunneled to the MN for the destination in the Binding 
Cache.

At this situation, smooth handoff operation will be available with the 
extension that MN can treat multiple Care-of-Address (COA) and that HA sends 
a multicast packet to the appropriate subnets.

Normally, Mobile Station (terminal) in current cellular system has a 
function of selecting the Base Station (BS) which can receive the data with 
the best condition [9]. Applying this method, MN is able to get multiple 
information about BSs. If the MN receives some IPv6 prefix announcements 
from the subnets, MN can generate multiple COAs. When MN sends them to HA 
by the Binding Update (BU) message, HA can create the addresses in his 
Binding Cache to multicast. Differing from the MIPv6, it is important that 
the HA should be able to treat multiple addresses for a single MN. 
Modification to the BS nor to the router is not needed.

Now, assume that MN generates the two COAs (COA#1 and COA#2), MN will send 
these addresses to his HA by BU message. Original Mobile IPv6 requires MN 
to select primary COA from candidate and send BU message to HA. It requires 
also HA to keep only one binding cache. By our extension, MN treats each 
address equally and makes BU for each of them. HA generates the appropriate 
entry for each of them without overwriting previous entry in their Binding 
Cache.

Packets from a CN or the other node to the shadow of the Home Address are 
blocked by the HA and are compared with the Binding Cache. Because the entry 
for the MN has two COAs, HA multicasts the packet to the MN with the Xcast6 
extension header (Fig.3.2 and Fig.3.3).

		Fig.3.3 Packet format from the HA


Using Xcast6 extension, smooth handoff for MIPv6 is realized. We show the 
example in Fig.3.4. Even if the receiving condition from BS1 becomes wrong, 
multicast packet can still receive via BS2, then a session will not break. 
If the air-link to the BS3 will be activate, sending COA#3 to the HA, MN 
can receive the multicast packet from BS3. In this way, seamless 
communication can be realized.

To save the resource of the air-link, MN may select one of the packets sent 
via multicast distribution. It will be accomplished by making a negotiation 
between BS and MN (Fig.3.5). The negotiation will be available with Layer 
2 or Layer 3 function. The detail should be for further study. Packets in 
the air-links which are not activated are deleted silently by the BS. 
ICMP-Destination Unreachable error must not be returned [6]. Actually, 
delete process are defined by the option header on the multicast packet 
[3].

	Fig.3.6 Fast handoff by air-link operation


In addition, it is applicable to use the route optimization procedure of 
MIPv6. In this environment, CN must have a function of receiving the BU 
message and sending the Xcast6 packets like HA.

The method for the authentication and the integrity of the data is based 
on the MIPv6. In other words, security association should be created between 
MN and HA or MN and CN, then Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating 
Security Payload (ESP) are used.


4. MN operation

In this section, we describe the detail operation of the Mobile Node (MN) 
and the modification from the original Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) specification 
[1].

Basically, MN operation is compatible with MIPv6. Route optimization is 
also available. With our extension, MN may require the multicast 
distribution to his Home Agent (HA) or the Correspondent Node (CN). This 
function has an advantage when the MN rapidly moves through multiple 
subnets.


4.1 Address registration

MN generates his Care-of-Address (COA) by the Router advertisement from 
the routers. At the same time, MN gets the HA lists by ICMP-Address Discovery 
procedure [1]. MN sends his COA to his HA by the Binding Update (BU) message. 
If the registration on the HA is succeeded, MN is ready to receive the 
packets after receiving the Binding Acknowledgement (BAck) message.

A packet from a CN or the other node to the shadow of the MN on the home 
link is blocked by the HA and tunneled to the MN according to HA's Binding 
Cache.


4.2 Multiple subnet registration

If the MN is available to receive the multiple information of the subnets, 
MN may register the multiple COAs to a HA repeating the procedure on the 
section 4.1.

Now assume that a MN receives the two Care-of-Address (COA) of COA#1 and 
COA#2 on the network in Fig.3.1. If the HA is Xcast6-aware, MN may send 
these COAs to a HA with the BU message individually. We show a registration 
sequence in Fig.4.1. The packet format for BU message is the same as that 
of the MIPv6 (Fig.4.2).

4.4 Selection of links for BSs

To save the bandwidth of the air-link, MN should decide the Base Station 
(BS) to receive the packet, and negotiate with it before receiving the 
packet. For example, MN can receive a packet only from the BS1 inactivating 
the link to BS2 (Fig.4.5). The procedure of the negotiation is considered 
in Layer 2 or Layer 3. A detail is for further study.

subnet that are already registered, fast handoff is available only
activating the appropriate air-link between the BS and the MN (Fig.4.6).

4.5 Route optimization

On receiving a packet via the HA, MN may send a BU message to the CN based 
on the MIPv6 route optimization procedure. After confirming the capability 
of Xcast6, MN may send some COAs to the CN. If the CN is Xcast6-aware, 
multicast packet will be sent with a Xcast6 header. Otherwise, CN will send 
a unicast packet to the destination of MN.

If a MN sends the BU messages to the CN with two COAs (COA#1 and COA#2), 
CN will multicast the Xcast6 packet including these COAs (Fig.4.7). Packet 
format from CN is also shown in Fig.4.8.

5. HA/MAP operation

In this section, we describe the detail function of the Home Agent (HA) 
and modification from the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) specification [1].

Basically, the HA actions are the same as that of the MIPv6 specification. 
Adding our extension, the fast handoff operation will be available without 
re-routing in the wired network. Mobility Access Point (MAP) defined in 
hierarchical MIPv6 [2] can be used for the backward compatibility or for 
policy reasons.


5.1 Sending a Router Advertisement message

HA sends a Router Advertisement message to his network. After relayed 
through the routers, a Mobile Node (MN) receives the message. This operation 
is the same as the MIPv6 [1].


5.2 Receiving a Binding Update message

In original MIPv6, Binding Cache is modified by the information of the BU 
message which HA received recently. In the Xcast6 extension, adding the 
previous BU information, MN may send the new subnet information with BU 
message. Therefore, we introduce a new procedure for HA to add the new 
multicast entry in the Binding Cache. The deadline of the information is 
administrated by the 'Lifetime' in the BU message. To delete an entry in 
the Binding Cache, MN should send a BU message with Lifetime equal zero.


5.3 Forwarding the packets from CN

A packet from a Correspondent Node (CN) or the other nodes to the shadow 
on the Home Address is blocked by HA. HA sends it to the MN's addresses 
written in the Binding Cache. The packet are encapsulated by HA based on 
the MIPv6 specification and are added the explicit multicast addresses on 
the option header of the Xcast6.


5.4 Action of the Xcast6-unaware HA

If a HA is not Xcast6-aware, HA acts as the original MIPv6 HA. On 
initialization sequence, MN should make a negotiation with his HA to check 
the capability of Xcast6-awareness. This procedure is for further
study.


6. CN operations

In this section, we describe the detail action of the Correspondent Node 
(CN) and the modification from the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) specification [1].

Basically, the action of the CN is the same as that of MIPv6. Route 
optimization is also available.


6.1 Triangle routing (CN -> HA => MN)

Before a route optimization, CN sends a normal packet to a shadow of the 
Mobile Node (MN) on the Home Link. The packet is tunneled by the Home Agent 
(HA), then sent to the actual MN. A packet from the MN to the CN is sent 
directly.


6.2 Route optimization (CN => MN)

If a CN is Xcast6-aware, when the MN sends the route optimization 
requirement, MN may send some COAs to the CN. CN will register these 
addresses on his Binding Cache and send the success information over a 
Binding Acknowledgement (BAck) message.

CN will multicast a packet including the explicit destination addresses 
of COAs on the Xcast6 extension header.


6.3 Action of the Xcast6-unaware CN

If a CN is not Xcast6-aware, CN acts as the original MIPv6 CN. MN may also 
realize the fast handoff by sending a packet to the Xcast6-aware HA. The 
selection of sending a CN's packet directly to MN or via HA is decided by 
the MN. Notice that MN should send the COA to CN concerning the air-link 
activated by MN.

On initialization sequence, MN should make a negotiation with his CN to 
check the capability of Xcast6-awareness. This procedure is for further 
study.


6.4 Consideration about MN-MN operation

If the Xcast6-aware CN is also a MN, a communication may be done between 
each MN. Basically, this operation will be available with our extension. 
A packet to control a MIPv6 may be piggy-backed on the Xcast6 multicast 
packet. A detail operation is for further study.


7. Compatibility of existing Mobile IPv6 specification

In the extension of this draft, there are few modifications from the Mobile 
IPv6 [1] or the hierarchical Mobile IPv6 [2] specification. Home Agent (HA) 
or Mobility Access Point (MAP) may be added the Small Group Multicast (SGM) 
function by adding the routing header of the addresses registered by the 
BU messages. If the HA or the MAP is not Xcast6-aware, HA/MAP is still act 
as an ordinary MIPv6/HMIPv6 node.

MN is needed to add the functions of sending the multiple subnet information 
and selecting the one of subnets. A protocol to select a subnet will be 
considered in Layer 2 or Layer 3. MN also needs to have a negotiation 
function to recognize that the HA and CN are Xcast6-aware. These protocols 
are for further study.


7.1 Data structures

The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) specification defines some conceptual data 
structures [1]. In this section, we will review them briefly then make clear 
the part to modify for the Xcast6 extension.

Binding Cache:
A cache, maintained by each IPv6 node, of bindings for other nodes. When 
sending a packet, the Binding Cache is searched before the Neighbor 
Discovery conceptual Destination Cache [14].  Each Binding Cache entry 
conceptually contains the following fields:

  - The home address of the mobile node.

  - The care-of address (COA) for the mobile node indicated by the home 
    address field in this Binding Cache entry. In the Xcast6 extension,
    plural entries are needed to record the addresses corresponding to
    the Xcast6 routes.

  - A lifetime value, indicating the remaining lifetime for this Binding
    Cache entry. In the Xcast6 extension, the lifetime value for each
    COA is maintained individually. They are initialized from the
    Lifetime field in the Binding Update (BU) that created or last 
    modified this Binding Cache entry.

  - A flag indicating whether or not this Binding Cache entry is a "home
    registration" entry.

  - A flag indicating whether or not this Binding Cache entry represents
    a mobile node that should be advertised as a router in proxy Neighbor
    Advertisements sent by this node on its behalf.  This flag is only 
    valid if the Binding Cache entry indicates that this is a "home 
    registration" entry.

  - The value of the Prefix Length field received in the Binding Update
    that created or last modified this Binding Cache entry.  This field 
    is only valid if the "home registration" flag is set on this Binding 
    Cache entry.

Below three fields are created and maintained individually corresponding 
to the COAs to be multicasted.

  - The maximum value of the Sequence Number field (16 bits) received 
    in previous Binding Updates for this mobile node home address.

  - Recent usage information for this Binding Cache entry.

  - The time at which a Binding Request was last sent for this entry.


Binding Update List:

A list, maintained by each mobile node, recording information for each 
Binding Update sent by this mobile node, for which the Lifetime sent in 
that Binding Update has not yet expired. The Binding Update List includes 
all bindings sent by the mobile node: those to correspondent nodes, those 
to the mobile node's home agent, and those to a home agent on the link on 
which the mobile node's previous care-of address is located. In the Xcast6 
extension, entries are created and maintained individually corresponding 
to each COA to be multicast. Each Binding Update List entry conceptually 
contains the following fields:

  - The IP address of the node to which a Binding Update was sent.  

  - The home address for which that Binding Update was sent.

  - The care-of address sent in that Binding Update.

  - The initial value of the Lifetime field sent in that Binding Update.

  - The remaining lifetime of that binding. This lifetime is initialized 
    from the Lifetime value sent in the Binding Update and is decremented 
    until it reaches zero, at which time this entry MUST be deleted from 
    the Binding Update List.

  - The maximum value of the Sequence Number field sent in previous 
    Binding Updates to this destination.

  - The time at which a Binding Update was last sent to this destination, 
    as needed to implement the rate limiting restriction for sending
    Binding Updates.

  - The state of any retransmissions needed for this Binding Update, 
    if the Acknowledge (A) bit was set in this Binding Update. This state 
    includes the time remaining until the next retransmission attempt 
    for the Binding Update, and the current state of the exponential 
    back-off mechanism for retransmissions.

  - A flag that indicates that future Binding Updates should not be sent 
    to this destination.


Home Agents List:

A list, maintained by each home agent and each mobile node, recording 
information about each home agent from which this node has received a Router 
Advertisement in which the Home Agent (H) bit is set, for which the remaining 
lifetime for this list entry (defined below) has not yet expired.  The home 
agents list is thus similar to the Default Router List conceptual data 
structure maintained by each host for Neighbor Discovery [14], although 
the Home Agents List MAY be implemented in any manner consistent with the 
external behavior described in this document.

In the Xcast6 extension, there is no modification for this list. Each Home 
Agents List entry conceptually contains the following fields:

  - The link-local IP address of a router on the link that this node 
    currently believes is operating as a home agent for that link. A new 
    entry is created or an existing entry is updated in the Home Agents 
    List in response to receipt of a valid Router Advertisement in which 
    the Home Agent (H) bit is set.  The link-local address of the home 
    agent is learned through the Source Address of the Router 
    Advertisements received from it [14].

  - One or more global IP addresses for this home agent, learned through 
    Prefix Information options with the Router Address (R) bit set,
    received in Router Advertisements from this link-local address.

  - The remaining lifetime of this Home Agents List entry.

  - The preference for this home agent taken from the Home Agent 
    Preference field; higher values indicate a more preferable home 
    agent.


8. Security consideration

The extension of this draft has a compatibility with the AAA (Authentication, 
Authorization and Accounting) function studied in the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) 
[1]. The procedure of the authentication and the integrity of a packet will 
be based on the MIPv6 specification. In other words, security associations 
are engaged between a Mobile Node (MN) and a Home Agent (HA) or MN and 
Correspondent Node (CN). Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating 
Security Payload (ESP) are also used.

In addition, a further AAA function based on the MIPv6 should be adapted 
as it is.
