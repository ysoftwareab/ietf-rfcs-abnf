1.  Introduction

   A mobile node in the current Internet needs to maintain a fixed
   endpoint when it moves to allow for seamless connectivity with its
   corresponding nodes.  When the mobile nodes moves between network-
   based mobility domains that are under different administrative
   control, this becomes challenging.  One network is responsible for
   the communication endpoint while the other network provides the
   actual mobility services to the mobile node.  This document proposes
   an approach to solve this problem by using inter-domain signaling to
   setup session handover and data forwarding between the different
   domains.

   A network-based localized mobility management solution like Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6] provides a mobile
   node with mobility within the PMIPv6-enabled domain it is deployed
   in.  When the mobile node leaves the network, however, the mobility
   support breaks since the mobile node moves out of the administrative
   reach of the local mobility solution.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

2.2.  Terminology

   Mobility Session

      The period of time in which the mobile node needs mobility support
      from the network.  If the mobile node reaches a state where it
      currently does not need mobility support, the mobility session can
      safely be reset.  During a mobility session the network-based
      mobility solution described in this document offers the mobile a
      fixed end-point for its communications, namely the session
      mobility anchor, which stays valid even when the mobile node moves
      between Proxy Mobile IP domains.

   Session Mobility Anchor

      A fixed end-point which relays all the communication for the
      mobile node.  This is the local mobility anchor of the first Proxy
      Mobile IP domain that a mobile node is connected to during a
      mobility session.

3.  Overview

   In order to provide continuous mobility support for a mobile nodes
   that is moving between different mobility domains, a steady anchor
   point has to be provided for corresponding nodes.  In Mobile IP, for
   example, this is the home agent while in Proxy Mobile IP this is the
   local mobility anchor (LMA).  This anchor point allows the mobile
   node to change its point of attachment to a network without its
   corresponding nodes noticing that.  All the mobile node's traffic is
   routed through the local mobility anchor which then forwards the
   traffic to the mobile node.  When a mobile node leaves a Proxy Mobile
   IP domain, however, it moves beyond the control of the local mobility
   anchor and therefore its mobility breaks.

   When a mobile node initially attaches to a Proxy Mobile IP domain,
   the local mobility anchor becomes the session mobility anchor (SMA)
   for the mobile node.  For the duration of the mobility session this
   session mobility anchor will handle all incoming and outgoing
   connections for the mobile node.  As long as the mobile node stays
   within the local Proxy Mobile IP domain, this only includes regular
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 operations as described in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].  When the mobile node leaves the local
   Proxy Mobile IP domain, however, the new Proxy Mobile IP domain's
   local mobility anchor will initialize a tunnel to the session
   mobility anchor to allow the session mobility anchor to continue
   serving as an anchor point for the mobile node.  Within the new Proxy
   Mobile IP domain all regular Proxy Mobile IP operations still apply
   with the exception that all traffic for the mobile node is tunneled
   from the new local mobility anchor to the session mobility anchor
   which in turn communicates with the correspondent node.

   For all intends and purposes from the point of view of the session
   mobility anchor, the current local mobility anchor of a mobile node
   can be seen as a mobile access gateway which performs the
   corresponding operations.

3.1.  Finding the session mobility anchor

   When a mobile node attaches to a Proxy Mobile IP domain, the local
   mobility anchor of this domain has to locate the session mobility
   anchor for this mobile node and initiate a tunnel between itself and
   the session mobility anchor.  In case the Proxy Mobile IP domain is
   the first domain the mobile node attaches to within its mobility
   session, the current local mobility anchor becomes the session
   mobility anchor and continues with its regular Proxy Mobile IP
   operations.  If the mobile node already has been attached to a
   different Proxy Mobile IP domain, it's session mobility anchor
   resides within this previous domain and the local mobility anchor
   needs to establish a binding with the session mobility anchor in
   order to send and receive the data for the mobile node through its
   session mobility anchor.  Depending on the scenario, the local
   mobility anchor can directly or indirectly locate the session
   mobility anchor for a mobile node.

3.1.1.  Direct location

   Direct location of a session mobility anchor for a mobile node
   requires some kind of look-up between associated Proxy Mobile IP
   domains.  For example, this can be achieved by maintaining a common
   database where session mobility anchors deposit the information for
   which mobile node they are responsible for.  Such a database can be
   established by service level agreements between the operators of
   Proxy Mobile IP domains.  For a local mobility anchor to locate the
   session mobility anchor for a mobile node it will send a look-up
   request to the database using the mobile node's identity (e.g. its
   Network Access Identifier (NAI) [RFC4282]) as the look-up key.  If
   the database does not have an entry for the mobile node, the local
   mobility anchor becomes the session mobility anchor for the mobility
   session of the mobile node.

3.1.2.  Indirect location

   If no common database exists between Proxy Mobile IP domains, the
   local mobility anchor can use an indirect scheme to locate the
   session mobility anchor of a mobile node.  For this purpose, the
   local mobility anchor infers the session mobility anchor assigned IP
   address of the mobile node and uses this address to send its session
   transfer request to.  Since the session mobility anchor is
   responsible for this IP address, the local mobility anchor will



Neumann, et al.          Expires January 8, 2009                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              Inter-Domain PMIP                  July 2008


   indirectly reach the session mobility anchor.  If there is no reply
   to the request, the local mobility anchor must assume that no
   previous session mobility anchor exists and itself become the session
   mobility anchor for the mobility session of the mobile node.  The
   session mobility anchor assigned IP address of a mobile node is the
   IP address the mobile node got assigned when it initially attached to
   a Proxy Mobile IP domain.  The local mobility anchor can try to infer
   this IP address, for example, by analyzing the mobile node's Router
   Solicitation messages [RFC4861] or DHCP requests [RFC3315].

3.2.  Assumptions

   This document assumes that there are some operational agreements
   between the operators of the different Proxy Mobile IP domains.  Part
   of this agreement are, for example, the conditions under which users
   are allowed to move between domains and the location method that is
   used to find the session mobility anchor.


4.  Inter-domain mobility support

4.1.  Registration of a new mobile node

   When a new mobile node attaches to a Proxy Mobile IP domain, the
   corresponding local mobility anchor registers itself as the new local
   mobility anchor for the mobile node with the session mobility anchor
   of the mobile node.

                           Figure 2: Signal Flow

   Figure Figure 2 shows the signaling flow when a mobile node attaches
   to a Proxy Mobile IP domain.  As in the normal Proxy Mobile IP case,
   the mobile node sends a Router Solicitation message that is received
   by the local mobile access gateway.  The mobile access gateway then
   sends its Proxy Binding Update (PBU) to the local mobility anchor.
   To register itself with the session mobility anchor as the new local
   mobility anchor for the mobile node, the local mobility anchor
   forwards this Proxy Binding Update to the session mobility anchor.
   The session mobility anchor then determines the corresponding
   policies for the mobile node as it would for a local mobile node and
   constructs the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment (PBA).  The Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgment is then sent to the local mobility anchor as if it
   were a local mobile access gateway and a bi-directional tunnel is
   established between the session mobility anchor and the local
   mobility anchor.  The local mobility anchor forwards the received
   Proxy Binding Acknowledgment to its mobile access gateway which in
   turn uses the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment to configure the mobile
   node.  Also, the local mobility anchor establishes the bi-direct
   tunnel to this mobile access gateway.  All traffic for the mobile
   node is then routed from the session mobility anchor through the
   local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway.  All future
   movements of the mobile node within the new Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain
   are covered by local mobility operations as described in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].

4.2.  Local routing

   Traffic might occur between nodes that are currently allocated in the
   same mobility domain but are associated with session mobility anchors
   outside this domain.  The local mobility anchor of the domain MAY
   optimize the delivery of this traffic by locally routing the packets
   instead of sending them over the corresponding session mobility
   anchor(s).  The flag EnableMAGLocalRouting MAY be used for
   controlling this behavior.  For further local routing considerations,
   see Section 6.10.3. of the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) document
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].


5.  Inter-Domain security

   This document introduces signaling and data forwarding between
   different Proxy Mobile IP domains which needs to be protected.  Proxy
   Mobile IP itself recommends using IPsec with established security
   associations to protect the signaling messages, Proxy Binding Update
   and Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message exchanges between the mobile
   access gateway and the local mobility anchor.  This document extends

   this recommendation for all message exchanges between the session
   mobility anchor and the local mobility anchor including forwarded
   data for the mobile node.  How the IPsec associations are established
   is beyond this document.


6.  IANA Considerations


7.  Security Considerations

   This section deals with the considerations related to intra-domain
   security within one Proxy Mobile IP domain and inter-domain security
   between different Proxy Mobile IP domains that are involved in
   managing a mobile nodes mobility.

7.1.  Intra-domain securtiy considerations

   This document does not change any intra-domain mobility procedures
   and therefore does not introduce additional intra-domain security
   risks.  The security considerations in [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6]
   cover security risks inside a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.

7.2.  Inter-domain security considerations

   The signaling and data forwarding between different Proxy Mobile IP
   domains where the session mobility anchor resides in one domain and
   the current local mobility anchor for a mobile node resides in the
   other domain is recommended to be protected by using IPsec with
   established security associations.  This means that the local
   mobility anchor establishes and maintains an IPsec tunnel to the
   session mobility anchor which is used for communications.  How these
   security associations are established is beyond this document.  It is
   recommended, however, to establish some kind of service agreements
   between service providers to specify security constraints and to
   arrange the valid endpoints (i.e. the local mobility anchor and
   session mobility anchor addresses).

   In opposite to plain Proxy Mobile IPv6, the signaling between the
   session mobility anchor and the mobile node traverses not only the
   Internet but also the local network of the current Proxy Mobile IP
   domain.  The signaling between the session mobility anchor and the
   mobile node is, therefore, at least exposed to the current local
   mobility anchor, and the corresponding mobile access gateways in the
   current Proxy Mobile IP domain.  Especially for applicable
   authentication procedures between the session mobility anchor and the
   mobile node, the session mobility anchor is recommended to only use
   procedures that cannot be exploited by overhearing parties.
