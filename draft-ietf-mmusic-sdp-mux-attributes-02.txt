            A Framework for SDP Attributes when Multiplexing
                draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes-02

Abstract

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms to
   describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media
   streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a
   multimedia session.  In the RTCWeb WG, there is a need to use a
   single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media associated with
   multiple media descriptions ("m=" lines).  Such a requirement has
   raised concerns over the semantic implications of the SDP attributes
   associated with the RTP Media Streams multiplexed over a single
   transport layer flow.

   The scope of this specification is to provide a framework for
   analyzing the multiplexing characteristics of SDP attributes.  The
   specification also categorizes existing attributes based on the
   framework described herein.

1.  Introduction

   Real-Time Communication Web (RTCWeb) framework requires Real-time
   Transport Protocol (RTP) as the media transport protocol and Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] for describing and negotiating
   multi-media communication sessions.

   SDP defines several attributes for capturing characteristics that
   apply to the individual media descriptions (described by "m=" lines")
   and the overall multimedia session.  Typically different media types
   (audio, video etc) described using different media descriptions
   represent separate RTP Sessions that are carried over individual
   transport layer flows.  However in the IETF RTCWEB WG, a need to use
   a single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media associated with
   multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines) has been identified.
   This would e.g. allow the usage of a single set of Interactive
   Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] candidates for multiple
   media descriptions.  This in turn has made necessary to understand

Internet-Draft         SDP Attribute Multiplexing              July 2014


   the interpretation and usage of the SDP attributes defined for the
   multiplexed media descriptions.

   Given the number of SDP attributes registered with the IANA [IANA]
   and possibility of new attributes being defined in the future, there
   is need for generic future-proof framework to analyze these
   attributes for their applicability in the transport multiplexing use-
   cases.

   The document starts with providing the motivation for requiring such
   a framework.  This is followed by introduction to the SDP attribute
   analysis framework/procedures, following which several sections
   applies the framework to the SDP attributes registered with the IANA
   [IANA]

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Motivation

   The time and complications of setting up ICE [RFC5245] and DTLS-SRTP
   [RFC5763] transports for use by RTP, and conservation of ports, forms
   an requirement to try and reduce the number of transport level flows
   needed.  This has resulted in the definition of ways, such as,
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] and
   [I-D.ietf-avt-multiplexing-rtp] to multiplex RTP over a single
   transport flow in order to preserve network resources such as port
   numbers.  This imposes further restrictions on applicability of these
   SDP attributes as they are defined today.

   The specific problem is that there are attribute combinations which
   make sense when specified on independent m-lines -- as with classical
   SDP -- that do not make sense when those m-lines are then multiplexed
   over the same transport.  To give an obvious example, ICE permits
   each m=line to have an independently specified ice-ufrag attribute.
   However, if the media from multiple m-lines is multiplexed over the
   same ICE component, then the meaning of media-level ice-ufrag
   attributes becomes muddled.

   As of today there are close to 250 SDP attributes registered with the
   IANA [IANA] and more will be added in the future.  There is no
   clearly defined procedure to establish the validity/applicability of
   these attribute when used with transport multiplexing.

4.  SDP Attribute Analysis Framework

   Attributes in an SDP session description can be defined at the
   session-level and media-level.  These attributes could be
   semantically grouped as noted below.

   o  Attributes related to media content such as media type, encoding
      schemes, payload types.

   o  Attributes specifying media transport characteristics like RTP/
      RTCP port numbers, network addresses, QOS.

   o  Metadata description attributes capturing session timing and
      origin information.

   o  Attributes establishing relationships between media streams such
      as grouping framework

   With the above semantic grouping as the reference, the proposed
   framework classifies each attribute into one of the following
   categories:

4.1.  Category: NORMAL

   Attributes that can be independently specified when multiplexing and
   retain their original semantics.

   In the example given below, the direction and label attributes are
   independently specified for audio and video m=lines.  These
   attributes are not impacted by multiplexing these media streams over
   a single transport layer flow.

4.2.  Category: NOT RECOMMENDED

   Attributes that are recommended against multiplexing since their
   usage under multiplexing might lead to incorrect behavior.

   Example: Multiplexing media descriptions having attribute zrtp-hash
   defined with the media descriptions lacking it, would either
   complicate the handling of multiplexed streams or might fail
   multiplexing altogether.

        t=0 0
        m=audio 3456 RTP/AVP 97 // with zrtp
        a=rtpmap:97 iLBC/8000
        <allOneLine>
        a=zrtp-hash:1.10 fe30efd02423cb054e50efd0248742ac7a52c8f91bc2

        m=video 34567 RTP/AVP 31 //without zrtp
        a=rtpmap:31 H261/90000

4.3.  Category: IDENTICAL

   Attributes that MUST be identical across all the media descriptions
   being multiplexed.

   Attributes such as rtcp-mux fall into this category.  Since RTCP
   reporting is done per RTP Session, RTCP Multiplexing MUST to enabled
   for both the audio and video m=lines in the example below if they are
   transported over a single 5-tuple.

4.4.  Category: SUM

   Attributes can be set as they are normally used but software using
   them in a multiplex case, MUST apply the sum of all the attributes
   being multiplexed instead of trying to use each one.  This is
   typically used for bandwidth or other rate limiting attributes to the
   underlining transport.

   The software parsing the SDP sample below, should use the aggregate
   Application Specific (AS) bandwidth value from the individual media
   descriptions to determine the AS value for the multiplexed session.
   Thus the calculated AS value would be 256+64 bytes for the given
   example.

         b=AS:64
         m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 31
         b=AS:256

4.5.  Category: TRANSPORT

   Attributes that can be set normally for multiple items in a
   multiplexed group but the software MUST pick just one of the
   attribute of the given type for use.  The one chosen is the attribute
   associated with the "m=" line that represents the information being
   used for the transport of the RTP.

   In the example below, "a=crypto" attribute is defined for both the
   audio and the video m=lines.  The video media line's a=crypto
   attribute is chosen since its mid value (bar) appears first in the
   a=group:BUNDLE line.  This is due to BUNDLE grouping semantic
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] which mandates the values
   from m=line corresponding to the mid appearing first on the
   a=group:BUNDLE line to be considered for setting up the RTP
   Transport.

   Attributes that encapsulate other SDP attributes and their
   multiplexing characteristics are inherited from the attributes they
   encapsulate.  Such attributes as of today, are defined in [RFC3407],
   [RFC5939] and [RFC6871] as part of a generic framework for indicating
   and negotiating transport, media and media format related
   capabilities in the SDP.

                        RFC5762 Attribute Analysis

   If RFC6773 is being used in addition to RFC5762 and provided that
   DCCP-in-UDP layer has additional demultiplexing, then it may be
   possible to use different DCCP service codes for each DCCP flow,
   given each uses a different DCCP port.  Although doing so might
   conflict with the media type of the m= line.  None of this is
   standardized yet and it wouldn't work as explained.  Hence
   multiplexing MUST NOT be performed even in this alternate scenario.

5.8.  RFC6773 - DCCP-UDP Encapsulation

   RFC6773 [RFC6773] document specifies an alternative encapsulation of
   the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), referred to as DCCP-
   UDP.  This encapsulation allows DCCP to be carried through the
   current generation of Network Address Translation (NAT) middle boxes
   without modification of those middle boxes

                        RFC6773 Attribute Analysis

   Since RFC6773 is about tunnelling DCCP in UDP, with the UDP port
   being the port of the DCCP en-/de-capsulation service.  This
   encapsulation allows arbitrary DCCP packets to be encapsulated and
   the DCCP port choosen MAY conflict with the port chosen for the RTP
   traffic.

   For multiplexing several DCCP-in-UDP encapsulations on the same UDP
   port, with no RTP traffic on the same port implies collapsing several
   DCCP port spaces together.  This MAY or MAY NOT work depending on the
   nature of DCCP encapsulations and ports choses thus rendering it to
   be very application dependant.

5.10.  RFC6787 - Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2

   The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) allows client
   hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers,
   recognizers, verifiers, and identifiers residing in servers on the
   network.  MRCPv2 is not a "stand-alone" protocol -- it relies on
   other protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to

   coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between
   them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe,
   discover, and exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP
   to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the
   media source or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the
   MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above,
   allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the
   speech resource server.  RFC6787 [RFC6787] defines attributes for
   this purpose.

5.16.  RFC6285 - Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions

   RFC6285 [RFC6285] describes a method using the existing RTP and RTP
   Control Protocol (RTCP) machinery that reduces the acquisition delay.
   In this method, an auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying the
   Reference Information to the receiver precedes or accompanies the
   multicast stream.  This unicast RTP flow can be transmitted at a
   faster than natural bitrate to further accelerate the acquisition.
   The motivating use case for this capability is multicast applications
   that carry real-time compressed audio and video.

5.17.  RFC6230 - Media Control Channel Framework

   RFC6230 [RFC6230] describes a framework and protocol for application
   deployment where the application programming logic and media
   processing are distributed.  This implies that application
   programming logic can seamlessly gain access to appropriate resources
   that are not co-located on the same physical network entity.  The
   framework uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish an
   application-level control mechanism between application servers and
   associated external servers such as media servers.

   media description line.  The sender of an SDP session description can
   attach the 'content' attribute to one or more media streams.  The
   receiving application can then treat each media stream differently
   (e.g., show it on a big or small screen) based on its content.

   boxes to anchor the MSRP connection, without the need for middle
   boxes to modify the MSRP messages; thus, it also enables secure end-
   to-end MSRP communication in networks where such middle boxes are
   deployed.  This document also defines a Session Description Protocol

5.30.  RFC4567 - Key Management Extensions for SDP and RTSP

   RFC4567 [RFC4567] defines general extensions for Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) to carry
   messages, as specified by a key management protocol, in order to
   secure the media.  These extensions are presented as a framework, to
   be used by one or more key management protocols.  As such, their use
   is meaningful only when complemented by an appropriate key management
   protocol.

   RFC4572 [RFC4572] specifies how to establish secure connection-
   oriented media transport sessions over the Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) protocol using the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  It
   defines a new SDP protocol identifier, 'TCP/TLS'.  It also defines
   the syntax and semantics for an SDP 'fingerprint' attribute that
   identifies the certificate that will be presented for the TLS
   session.  This mechanism allows media transport over TLS connections

   defines the syntax and semantics for an SDP "source-filter" attribute
   that may reference either IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) as either an
   inclusive or exclusive source list for either multicast or unicast
   destinations.  In particular, an inclusive source-filter can be used

5.33.  RFC6128 - RTCP Port for Multicast Sessions

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) has an attribute that allows
   RTP applications to specify an address and a port associated with the
   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) traffic.  In RTP-based source-specific
   multicast (SSM) sessions, the same attribute is used to designate the
   address and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in the SDP
   description.  However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM session
   itself cannot be specified by the same attribute to avoid ambiguity,
   and thus, is required to be derived from the "m=" line of the media
   description.  Deriving the RTCP port from the "m=" line imposes an

                        RFC3108 Attribute Analysis

   RFC3108 describes conventions for using the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) for characterizing ATM bearer connections using an
   AAL1, AAL2 or AAL5 adaptation layers.  For AAL1, AAL2 and AAL5,
   bearer connections can be used to transport single media streams.  In
   addition, for AAL1 and AAL2, multiple media streams may be
   multiplexed into a bearer connection.  For all adaptation types
   (AAL1, AAL2 and AAL5), bearer connections may be bundled into a
   single media group.  In all cases addressed by RFC3108, a real-time
   media stream (voice, video, voiceband data, pseudo-wire and others)
   or a multiplex of media streams is mapped directly into an ATM
   connection.  RFC3108 does not address cases where ATM serves as a
   low-level transport pipe for IP packets which in turn may carry one
   or more real-time (e.g.  VoIP) media sessions with a life-cycle
   different from that of the underlying ATM transport.

   The intention of TIAS is that the media level bit-rate is multiplied
   with the known per-packet overhead for the selected transport and the
   maxprate value to determine the worst case bit-rate from the
   transport to more accurately capture the required usage.  Summing

   TIAS values independently across m=lines and multiplying the computed
   sum with maxprate and the per-packet overhead would inflate the value
   significantly.  Instead performing multiplication and adding the
   individual values is a more appropriate usage.  This still ignores
   the fact that this is a send side declaration, and not intended for
   receiver negotiation.

   over UDP, using the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) as a feedback
   mechanism.  It defines a new RTCP Extended Report (XR) block for
   periodic ECN feedback, a new RTCP transport feedback message for
   timely reporting of congestion events, and a Session Traversal
   Utilities for NAT (STUN) extension used in the optional
   initialization method using Interactive Connectivity Establishment

7.5.  RFC6642 - Third-Party Loss Report

   In a large RTP session using the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback
   mechanism defined in RFC 4585 [RFC4585], a feedback target may
   experience transient overload if some event causes a large number of
   receivers to send feedback at once.  This overload is usually avoided
   by ensuring that feedback reports are forwarded to all receivers,
   allowing them to avoid sending duplicate feedback reports.  However,
   there are cases where it is not recommended to forward feedback
   reports, and this may allow feedback implosion.  RFC6642 [RFC6642]
   memo discusses these cases and defines a new RTCP Third-Party Loss
   Report that can be used to inform receivers that the feedback target
   is aware of some loss event, allowing them to suppress feedback.
   Associated Session Description Protocol (SDP) signaling is also
   defined.

   RFC5956 [RFC5956] defines the semantics for grouping the associated

   document are to be used with the SDP Grouping Framework (RFC 5888).
   These semantics allow the description of grouping relationships
   between the source and repair flows when one or more source and/or
   repair flows are associated in the same group, and they provide
   support for additive repair flows.  SSRC-level (Synchronization
   Source) grouping semantics are also defined in this document for
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams using SSRC multiplexing.

13.1.  RFC5109 - RTP Payload Format for Generic FEC

   RFC5109 [RFC5109] describes a payload format for generic Forward
   Error Correction (FEC) for media data encapsulated in RTP.  It is
   based on the exclusive-or (parity) operation.  The payload format
   allows end systems to apply protection using various protection
   lengths and levels, in addition to using various protection group
   sizes to adapt to different media and channel characteristics.  It
   enables complete recovery of the protected packets or partial
   recovery of the critical parts of the payload depending on the packet
   loss situation.

   Note: This section does not yet have WG consensus but is included as
   a proposal to the WG.  There are two options being proposed, A and B.
   The authors suggest A.

14.1.  Option A

   This section provides two rules for multiplexing multiple media
   streams with DSCP markings over a single 5-tuple.

      Rule 1: Media Streams with markings from different service classes
      MUST NOT be multiplexed.  For example, a media stream with DSCP
      Marking EF MUST NOT be multiplexed with a media stream marked with
      AF class.  Likewise, a media stream with DSCP marking AF3x MUST
      NOT be multiplexed with a media stream marked with AF4x.

      Rule 2: Media Streams that belong to the same service class, even
      with different drop precedence, MAY be multiplexed.  Thus media
      streams that all belong to the EF group or all that belong to the
      AF4X class can be multiplexed.

Internet-Draft         SDP Attribute Multiplexing              July 2014


   For WebRTC applications following the advice in
   [I-D.dhesikan-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos], the above rules end up allowing the
   audio and video to be multiplexed in many, but not all, cases.

14.2.  Option B

   Media Streams MAY be multiplexed regardless of what the setting of
   the DSCP Per Hop Behavior group (PHB).

15.  Multiplexing Considerations for Encapsulating Attributes

   This sections deals with recommendations for defining the
   multiplexing characteristics of the SDP attributes that encapsulate
   other SDP attributes/parameters.  Such attributes as of today, for
   example, are defined in [RFC3407], [RFC5939] and [RFC6871] as part of
   a generic framework for indicating and negotiating transport, media
   and media format related capabilities in the SDP.

   The behavior of such attributes under multiplexing is in turn defined
   by the multiplexing behavior of the attributes they encapsulate which
   are made known once the Offer/Answer negotiation process is
   completed.

15.1.  RFC3407 - cpar Attribute Analysis

   RFC3407 capability parameter attribute (a=cpar) encapsulates b=
   (bandwidth) or an a= attribute.  For bandwidth attribute
   encapsulation, the category SUM is inherited.  For the case of a=
   attribute, the category corresponding to the SDP attribute being
   referenced is inherited.

Internet-Draft         SDP Attribute Multiplexing              July 2014


   In the above example ,the category IDENTICAL is inherited for the
   cpar encapsulated rtcp-mux attribute.

15.2.  RFC5939 Analysis

   [RFC5939] defines a general SDP capability negotiation framework.  It
   also specifies how to provide transport protocols and SDP attributes
   as capabilities and negotiate them using the framework.

   For this purpose, [RFC5939] defines the following

   o  A set of capabilities for the session and its associated media
      stream components, supported by each side.  The attribute
      ("a=acap") defines how to list an attribute name and its
      associated value (if any) as a capability.  The attribute
      ("a=tcap") that defines how to list transport protocols (e.g.,
      "RTP/AVP") as capabilities.

   o  A set of potential configurations indicating which combinations of
      those capabilities can be used for the session and its associated
      media stream components.  Potential configurations are not ready
      for use.  Instead, they provide an alternative that may be used,
      subject to further negotiation.

   o  An actual configuration for the session and its associated media
      stream components, that specifies which combinations of session
      parameters and media stream components can be used currently and
      with what parameters.  Use of an actual configuration does not
      require any further negotiation.

   o  A negotiation process that takes the set of actual and potential
      configurations (combinations of capabilities) as input and
      provides the negotiated actual configurations as output.

15.2.1.  Recommendations

   This section provides recommendations for entities generating and
   processing SDP under the generic capability negotiation framework as
   defined in [RFC5939] under the context of media stream multiplexing.

   These recommendations are provided for the purposes of enabling the
   Offerer to make sure that the generated potential configurations
   between the multiplexed streams can (easily) be negotiated to be
   consistent between those streams.

Internet-Draft         SDP Attribute Multiplexing              July 2014


15.2.1.1.  Recommendation-1: Transport Capability Analysis

   When a transport capability is proposed as a potential configuration
   under a given media description, it is recommended that all the media
   descriptions under multiplexing have the same potential configuration
   number for the given transport capability.

   a=tcap:1 RTP/SAVPF
   a=tcap:2 RTP/SAVP
   a=group:BUNDLE audio video
   m= audio
   a=mid:audio
   a=pcfg:1 t=1
   a=pcfg:2
   m= video
   a=mid:video
   a=pcfg:1 t=1
   a=pcfg:2 t=2

   In the example above, the potential configurations that Offer
   transport protocol capability of RTP/SAVPF has the same configuration
   number "1" in both the audio and video media descriptions.

15.2.1.2.  Recommendation-2: Attribute Capability Analysis

   For attribute capabilities which are offered as potential
   configurations that encapsulate attributes whose value MUST be
   IDENTICAL under multiplexing, it is recommended that all the media
   descriptions under multiplexing have the same potential configuration
   number for the given attribute capability.

   a=acap:1 a=rtcp-mux
   a=acap:2 a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80
          inline:EcGZiNWpFJhQXdspcl1ekcmVCNWpVLcfHAwJSoj|2^20|1:32
   a=group:BUNDLE audio video
   m= audio 49172 RTP/AVP 99
   a=mid:audio
   a=pcfg:1 a=1
   a=pcfg:2
   m= video 560024 RTP/AVP 100
   a=mid:video
   a=pcfg:1 a=1
   a=pcfg:2 a=2

   In the example above, the potential configuration number 1 is
   repeated while referring to attribute capability a=rtcp-mux, since
   the behavior is IDENTICAL for the attribute a=rtcp-mux under
   multiplexing.

15.2.1.3.  Recommendation-3: Sescap Attribute Analysis

   It is recommended that any bundled media descriptions/configurations
   are also acceptable combinations of media streams/configurations as
   specified by "sescap" attribute.

15.2.1.4.  Recommendation-4: Capability Extension Attributes

   Since it is nearly impossible to define a generic mechanism for
   various capability extensions , this document does't provide
   procedures for dealing with the capability extension attributes.
   However, Section Section 15.3 provide analysis of media capability
   extension attributes as defined in [RFC6871].

15.3.  RFC6871 Analysis

   [RFC6871] extends capability negotiation framework described in
   [RFC5939] by defining media capabilities that can be used to indicate
   and negotiate media types and their associated format parameters.

   Building upon the analysis from the previous section, following
   recommendation is provided for dealing with the attributes defined in
   [RFC6871] under multiplexing

15.3.1.  Recommendation-5: Attribute Capability Under Shared Payload
         Type

   For attribute capabilities which are offered as potential
   configurations that encapsulate attributes whose value MUST be
   IDENTICAL-PER-PT under multiplexing, it is recommended that all the
   media descriptions under multiplexing have the same potential
   configuration number for the given attribute capability

   The attributes (a=rmcap, a=mfcap) follow the above recommendations
   under mutliplexing

   a=pcfg:4 m=5 pt=5:101


   In the example above, the potential configuration number 1 is
   repeated when referring to media and media format capability used for
   the Payload Type 97.  This implies that both the media capability 2
   and 4 along with their media format capabilities MUST refer to the
   same Codec configuration , as per the definition of IDENTICAL-PER-PT

15.4.  Recommendation-6: Offer/Answer Negotiation Expectations

   For attributes encapsulated via "a=acap", "a=omcap", "a=mscap"
   capability attributes and presented as part of potential/actual
   configurations during the Offer/Answer negotiation prodecure, the
   negotiation MUST ensure that the multiplexing behavior of these
   capabilities inherit from the behavior of the attribute being
   encapsulated.

   Example 1: Below SDP example captures the following aspects.

   o  The Offerer offers audio and video streams with several different
      RTP profiles (AVP, SAVP, SAVPF) as potential configurations.

   o  Valid Answer that corresponds to the SDP answer where the Answerer
      accepts RTP/SAVPF as the default profile for both the media
      streams.  In this scenario both the media streams can be
      successfully multiplexed.

   o  Invalid Answer wherein the Answerer accepts the profile RTP/SAVPF
      for the audio stream and RTP/AVPF for the video stream.  This
      scenario results in the failure of the multiplexing as defined in
      the section 7.2 of the BUNDLE specification [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-
      bundle-negotiation].
