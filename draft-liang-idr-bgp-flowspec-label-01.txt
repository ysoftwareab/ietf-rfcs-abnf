              Carrying Label Information for BGP FlowSpec
                 draft-liang-idr-bgp-flowspec-label-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a method in which the label mapping
   information for a particular FlowSpec rule is piggybacked in the same
   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Update message that is used to
   distribute the FlowSpec rule.  Based on the proposed method, the
   Label Switching Routers (LSRs) (except the ingress LSR) on the Label
   Switched Path (LSP) can use label to indentify the traffic matching a
   particular FlowSpec rule; this facilitates monitoring and traffic
   statistics for FlowSpec rules.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5575] defines the flow specification (FlowSpec) that is an
   n-tuple consisting of several matching criteria that can be applied
   to IP traffic.  The matching criteria can include elements such as
   source and destination address prefixes, IP protocol, and transport
   protocol port numbers.  A given IP packet is said to match the
   defined flow if it matches all the specified criteria.  [RFC5575]
   also defines a set of filtering actions, such as rate limit,
   redirect, marking, associated with each flow specification.  A new
   Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer Reachability Information (BGP
   NLRI) (AFI/SAFI: 1/133 for IPv4, AFI/SAFI: 1/134 for VPNv4) encoding
   format is used to distribute traffic flow specifications.

   [RFC3107] specifies the way in which the label mapping information
   for a particular route is piggybacked in the same Border Gateway
   Protocol Update message that is used to distribute the route itself.
   Label mapping information is carried as part of the Network Layer
   Reachability Information (NLRI) in the Multiprotocol Extensions
   attributes.  The Network Layer Reachability Information is encoded as
   one or more triples of the form <length, label, prefix>.  The NLRI

   contains a label is indicated by using Subsequent Address Family
   Identifier (SAFI) value 4.

   [RFC4364] describes a method in which each route within a Virtual
   Private Network (VPN) is assigned a Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) label.  If the Address Family Identifier (AFI) field is set to
   1, and the SAFI field is set to 128, the NLRI is an MPLS-labeled VPN-
   IPv4 address.

   In BGP VPN/MPLS networks, when FlowSpec rules on multiple forwarding
   devices in the network bound with labels form one or more LSPs, only
   the ingress LSR (Label Switching Router) needs to identify a
   particular traffic flow based on the matching criteria and then
   steers the packet to a corresponding LSP (Label Switched Path).
   Other LSRs of the LSP just need to forward the packet according to
   the label carried in it.

   Though the FlowSpec rule could use the label(s) bound with the best-
   match unicast route for the destination prefix embedded in the
   FlowSpec rule or the best-match route to the target IP in the
   'redirect to IP' action, this way means that if two or more FlowSpec
   rules have the same best-match unicast route for the embedded
   destination prefix or the same best-match route to target IP in the
   'redirect to IP' action; they would be mapped to the same label.
   This would affect monitoring and traffic statistics facilities,
   because each FlowSpec rule requires an independent statistic and log
   data, which is described in Section 9 [RFC5575].  The LSRs (except
   the ingress LSR) on the LSP can use label to indentify the traffic
   matching a particular FlowSpec rule; this facilitates monitoring and
   traffic statistics for FlowSpec rules.

   So this document proposes that the BGP router supports to allocate a
   label to one or more FlowSpec rule(s), the forwarding path is still
   decided by the best-match unicast route for the embedded destination
   prefix or the best-match route to target IP in the 'redirect to IP'
   action.  Figure 1 gives an example that FlowSpec rule bound with a
   label is disseminated in the network.

  FlowSpec rule1 (injected in PE2):
       Filters:
          destination ip prefix:IP2/32
          source ip prefix:IP1/32
       Actions:
          traffic-marking: 1

  Labels allocated for FlowSpec1:
       Label4 allocated by PE2
       Label3 allocated by ASBR2
       Label2 allocated by ASBR1
       Label1 allocated by PE1

  PE2 disseminates the FlowSpec1 bound with Label4 to ASBR2.
  ASBR2 disseminates the FlowSpec1 bound with Label3 to ASBR1.
  ASBR1 disseminates the FlowSpec1 bound with Label2 to PE1.

  Forwarding information for the traffic from IP1 to IP2 in the Routers:
       PE1: in(<IP2,IP1>) --> out(Label2)
       ASBR1: in(Label2) --> out(Label3)
       ASBR2: in(Label3) --> out(Label4)
       PE2: in(Label4) --> out(--)

   So ASBR1 can do traffic statistics for FlowSpec rule 1 based on
   Label2; ASBR2 can do it based on Label3; and PE2 can do it based on
   Label4.

2.  Terminology

   This section contains definitions of terms used in this document.

      Flow Specification (FlowSpec): A flow specification is an n-tuple
      consisting of several matching criteria that can be applied to IP
      traffic, including filters and actions.  Each FlowSpec consists of
      a set of filters and a set of actions.

3.  Protocol Extensions

   In this document, BGP is used to distribute the FlowSpec rule bound
   with label(s).  A new label-action is defined as BGP extended
   community value based on Section 7 of [RFC5575].

   Label-action is described below:

  0                   1                   2                   3

 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 |      Type  (TBD1)             |OpCode |         Reserved      |
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Label

 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Entry

   The use and the meaning of these fields are as follows:

      Type: the same as defined in [RFC4360]

      OpCode: Operation code

   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   |OpCode| Function                                                   |
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  0   | Push the MPLS tag                                          |
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  1   | Pop the outermost MPLS tag in the packet                   |
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  2   | Swap the MPLS tag with the outermost MPLS tag in the packet|
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   | 3~15 | Reserved                                                   |
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+

         When the OpCode field is set to 1, the label stack entry is
         invalid, and the router SHOULD pop the existing outermost MPLS
         tag in the packet.

         When the OpCode field is set to 2, the router SHOULD swap the
         label stack entry with the existing outermost MPLS tag in the
         packet.  If the packet has no MPLS tag, it just pushes the
         label stack entry.

         The OpCode 0 or 1 may be used in some SDN networks, such as the
         scenario described in
         [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-central-epe].

         The OpCode 2 can be used in traditional BGP MPLS/VPN networks.

      Bottom of Stack (S): the same as defined in [RFC3032].  It SHOULD
      be invalid, and set to zero by default.  It MAY be modified by the
      forwarding router locally.

      Time to Live (TTL): the same as defined in[RFC3032].  It MAY be
      modified by the forwarding router locally.

      Experimental Use (Exp): the same as defined in [RFC3032].  It MAY
      be modified by the forwarding router according to the local
      routing policy.

      Label: the same as defined in [RFC3032].

   A FlowSpec rule MAY include one or more ordering label-action(s).
   The arrival order of the label-actions decides the action order.

   If the BGP router allocates a label for a FlowSpec rule and
   disseminates the labeled FlowSpec rule to the upstream peers, it can
   use the label to match the traffic identified by the FlowSpec rule in
   the forwarding plane.

4.  IANA Considerations

   For the purpose of this work, IANA should allocate value for the type
   of label-action:

      TBD1 for label-action

5.  Security considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing BGP.
