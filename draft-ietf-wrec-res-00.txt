Abstract

   This document summarizes open research issues in the support
   distributed caching and replication of web objects.  The potential
   solutions and mechanisms described are preliminary. This document

   does not endorse the suitability of these mechanisms for use in the
   Internet, or in private networks. This document focuses on the
   research issues, and mentions candidate solutions only in the context
   of these issues.

   This document is a product of the IETF Web Caching and Replication
   (WREC) WG.  Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the
   author.

1.  Introduction


   This document summarizes the research issues of web caching and
   replication. It focuses on issues whose solutions are either unknown
   or are under current development, and not yet ready for standardiza-
   tion. This document is intended to define the unsolved or incom-
   pletely solved issues, to give the community a uniform basis for the
   development of mechanisms to address these issues in the future.

   The principle of this document is to focus on the research issues
   themselves, rather than to focus on candidate solutions in particu-
   lar. Solutions will be described only insofar as they can be shown to
   address a definite issue.

   The document is organized as follows:

       Background:             common background for the discussions

       Template description:   defines a common template format
                               for the presentation of the issues

       Research Issues:        a list of the research issues,
                               in the common template format

                               issues are presented in arbitrary order
                               [Ed. - unless we find a better order]

3.  Template Description


   Each item in this section will consist of the following template:

           2.3.1. Name:
           2.3.1.1. Definition:
           2.3.1.2. Goal:
           2.3.1.3. Layers:
           2.3.1.3. Indications:
           2.3.1.4. Contraindications:
           2.3.1.5. Components:
           2.3.1.6. Proposed solutions:
           2.3.1.7. Security Issues:
           2.3.1.8. Contact:

   The following is a discussion of the component sections:


3.1.  Name

   The name is a brief label suitable to uniquely identify the issue in
   other text discussions. It should be brief enough to use repeatedly
   in text, or include a suitable acronym if not. The words described
   must be in common use, or as defined in the web caching and replica-
   tions taxonomy [WREC-TAX]. The name should not be longer than five
   (5) simple words, and compound words and adjectives should be used
   sparingly.

3.2.  Definition

   The definition is a terse description of the issue, suitable to
   uniquely identify the key features of the issue. It should be
   minimal, providing only necessary and sufficient terms to identify
   the issue. The definition should refer to published work, where pos-
   sible, providing additional information.

3.3.  Goal

   The goal is a terse description of the reason for seeking a solution
   to the issue, in terms of objectively measurable gains. The gains, if
   not manifest, should also be justified.

3.4.  Layers

   This item describes the layer at which the issue is predominant. It
   must be a subset of only the following terms: LINK, NETWORK, TRAN-
   SPORT, MIDDLEWARE, and APPLICATION. Link, network, transport, and

Touch            Web Cach. and Repl. -- Research Issues   March 22, 1999


   application are as commonly referred to in the ISO standard reference
   model. Middleware is hereby defined as "common layered services
   between the traditional application and transport layers", i.e., the
   sum of services provided by the traditional ISO session and presenta-
   tion layers, or anything else considered below the application, but
   above the transport layers.

3.5.  Indications

   This item specifies the conditions where solutions to the issue are
   of significant, measurable benefit, vs. not addressing the issue. The
   specification should be terse, and necessary and sufficient.  The
   benefits should not depend on a particular solution, but rather apply
   most generally to any viable solution to the issue.

3.6.  Contraindications

   This item specifies the conditions where solutions to the issue are
   if significant, measurable detriment, vs. not addressing the issue.
   The description is subject to the same qualifications as 'Indica-
   tions'.

3.7.  Components:

   This item is a brief description of the key components of the issue.
   The components may be subordinate issues described elsewhere in this
   document, or key mechanisms required to address the issue. The com-
   ponent issues should be necessary and sufficient.

3.8.  Proposed solutions:

   This item is a brief description of candidate solutions. It should be
   sufficient to indicate which solutions there are, and to define their
   important aspects only. This section is not intended to replace a
   published reference for a solution, and should not itself be suffi-
   cient as a reference for a solution. It should only describe what the
   solutions are, and how they differ.

3.9.  Security Issues:

   This item should address the unique security considerations of the
   issue only. It should be limited to security issues that necessarily
   occur as a result of any solution to the issue, rather than address-
   ing the security of any particular proposed solution.

3.10.  Contact:

   The submitter must provide a contact name, address, and e-mail, for

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are addressed in the individual discussions
   of each research issue.

   [Ed. - this section should have an additional summary of the main
   security considerations, i.e., to indicate the predominant issues. As
   such, it should be updated later.]
