  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

2.  Introduction 
   
  ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping), RFC 3761 [1] is a system that transforms 
  E.164 numbers (The International Public Telecommunication Number 
  Plan, ITU-T Recommendation E.164) [2] into domain names and then uses 
  the Domain Name System (DNS), RFC 1034 [3] and Naming Authority 
  Pointer Records (NAPTR) records in the Dynamic Delegation Discovery 
  System (DDDS) RFC 3403 [4]) to query the services that are available 
  for a specific domain name.

Internet-Draft           CNAM Enumservice             August 2006 
 
 
  This document registers an Enumservice 'cnam' according to the 
  guidelines given in RFC 3761 [1], to be used for provisioning a NAPTR 
  [4] resource record to indicate a type of functionality associated 
  with an end point and/or telephone number.  The registration is 
  defined within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System 
  [4][5][6][7][8]) hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" DDDS Application 
  defined in RFC 3761.  
   
  This document also registers an IANA application specific media type 
  'application/cnam' per the requirements of BCP 13/RFC 4288. 
   
  The purpose of this Enumservice is to enable service providers to 
  place Calling Name Delivery information (CNAM) into ENUM databases or 
  to send ENUM queries to a protocol converter that would have access 
  to the Signaling System 7 (SS7) Network.  This, in turn, could enable 
  such parties to offer Calling Name Delivery services using the 
  technology provided by RFC 3761.  
   
  The service parameters defined in RFC 3761 dictate that a 'type' and 
  one or more 'subtype' should be specified.  Within this set of 
  specifications the convention is assumed that the 'type'(being the 
  more generic term) defines the service and at least one of the 
  'subtype' may indicate the URI scheme. 
   
  In this document, one type is specified, 'pstn' and one subtype 
  'cnam' with the URI scheme specified, 'data:' as specified in RFC 
  2397 [16]. 
   
     
3.   Definition of PSTN CNAM Data  
                                      
  Calling Name data is a string of up to 15 ASCII [9] characters of 
  information associated with a specific calling party number [10] [11] 
  [12] [13] [14].  In the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) this 
  data is sent by the originating network only at the specific request 
  of the terminating network via a SS7 Transaction Capabilities 
  Application Part (TCAP) response message.    
   
   
4.   The CNAM data URI                                               
 
  RFC 2397 [16] specifies the structure and parameters for the data URI 
  as follows 
 
  dataurl    := "data:" [ mediatype ] [ ";base64" ] "," data 
         mediatype  := [ type "/" subtype ] *( ";" parameter ) 
         data       := *urlchar 
         parameter  := attribute "=" value

Internet-Draft           CNAM Enumservice             August 2006 
 
 
  In order to distinguish the Calling Name data media type used within 
  this URL this document specifically registers with IANA the media 
  type 'application/cnam'.  
   
  All responses using this specification SHOULD specifically reference 
  the media type 'application/cnam'. 
   
  ANSI standards specify the use of ASCII [9] in the response to TCAP 
  queries for Calling Name data.  This specification does not preclude 
  the use of internationalized characters within the CNAM data URI, nor 
  does it preclude the use of more than 15 characters.  
 
  Enumservice Privacy Responses and Parameters 
 
  The PSTN defines several values for CNAM data in the event that there 
  are privacy restrictions on the access to that data or that the data 
  is unavailable.  These are defined as "Reason for Absence of Name" in 
  GR-1188 [13], consequently the following responses to a query from a 
  well known database are reserved. 
   
  Within the media type 'application/cnam' an two optional parameters 
  are supported. 
     
  Calling Name Privacy Indicator: 'unavailable=p'   
   
  This parameter defined as the Calling Name data information may be 
  available but the Calling Party does not wish to have their Calling 
  Name data displayed by Called Party User Agents.  
   
  Usage: data:application/cnam;unavailable=p 
   
  Calling Name Status Indicator 
   
  Definition: 'unavaiable=u' 
   
  This parameter is defined as there is no Calling Name data for that 
  E.164 number available. 
   
  Usage: data:application/cnam;unavailable=u 
 
 
   
5.   Distribution of CNAM Data                                        
   
  The distribution of CNAM data is often highly restricted.  The NAPTR 
  records described herein probably would not be part of the e164.arpa 
  DNS tree.  Distribution of this NAPTR data would be either (a) on a 
  private basis (within a service provider's internal network, or on a 
  private basis between one or more parties using a variety of security

  mechanisms to prohibit general public access) or (b) openly available 
  on a national basis according to national regulatory policy.  
   
  The authors believe it is most likely that these records will be 
  distributed on a purely private basis.  If such data was distributed 
  nationally, a national regulatory body may have jurisdiction, 
  especially since CNAM information may contain Personally Identifying 
  Information.  Such a body may choose to restrict distribution of the 
  data in such a way that it may not pass over that country's national 
  borders.  How Personally Identifying Information is collected, 
  distributed and subsequently regulated is out of the scope of this 
  document. 
   
   
6.   Enumservice CNAM Response Examples                                 
 
  This section documents an example for illustrative purposes.  These 
  examples shall in no way limit the various forms that this 
  Enumservice may take.  
   
   
   
  $ORIGIN 0.0.1.0.0.0.1.5.5.5.1.e164.carrier1.example.net. 
    NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:cnam" 
    "!^.*$!data:application/cnam,Francois%20Marie20%Arouet!". 
   
   
   
  Should no media type be present in the data URI it is presumed that 
  the data portion of the URI after the comma is ASCII text as per RFC 
  2397 
   
   
  $ORIGIN 0.0.1.0.0.0.1.5.5.5.1.carrier1.example.net. 
    NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:cnam"
    "!^.*$!data:,Francois%20Marie20%Arouet!". 
   
   
  $ORIGIN 0.0.1.0.0.0.1.5.5.5.1..carrier1.example.net. 
    NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:cnam" 
    "!^.*$!data:application/cnam;unavailable=u,!". 
   
    
6.1 Example Call Flow 
   
  Typically, the Calling Name data in the PSTN is delivered to the 
  called party during the first silent interval after the first ringing 
  [13] (see requirement R3-341).  If the Called party answers the call 
  before this, Calling Name data may not be delivered.

Internet-Draft           CNAM Enumservice             August 2006 
 
 
   
  This is an example of how a switch, proxy, or other calling 
  application may make use of this Enumservice type during the call 
  initiation process.  
 
       a) A PSTN user, say from +USA: +1(555)100-0199 which is 
       connected to a calling application, dials an E.164 telephone 
       number: +1(555)100-0100. 
        
       b) The calling application uses the dialed number to form a 
       FQDN NAPTR query: 0.0.1.0.0.0.1.5.5.5.1.e164.arpa. 
        
       c) The DNS finds an E2U+sip record and returns a sip URI for 
       processing by the calling application: 
        sip:+15551000100@sbc2.carrier2.example.net;user=phone. 
   
       d) A SIP invite is sent to the Called Party proxy at 
       carrier2.example.net. 
        
       e) The Called Party's SIP proxy/User Agent sees the SIP message 
       and before alerting the Called User, performs another ENUM 
       request using the E164 number from the SIP INVITE From: field 
       (i.e. +1-(555)100-0199), and sends this query to a well known 
       database source for CNAM queries:  
       9.9.1.0.0.0.1.5.5.5.1.cnamedb.networks.example.net 
        
       f) Once the data URI containing the CNAM data is returned from 
       the well-known database source, the Called party's proxy/User 
       Agent alerts the Called User about the incoming call and 
       includes the Calling Name data in the SIP INVITE sent to the 
       Called User.  It then sends a 180 Ringing message to the 
       Calling party's proxy, signaling the desire to establish the 
       session.  At that point the Called Party's Client User Agent 
       could display the CNAM data. 
        
       g) Once the Called User decides to accept the call, the RTP 
       stream commences and the session begins. 
   
     NOTE: The above example describes in general the approach that 
     would be required by a terminating SIP UA/Proxy to acquire and 
     send CNAM information to the Called Party.  The exact mechanism, 
     determination of when to issue ENUM-CNAM request, and formatting 
     of SIP messages is beyond the scope of this document. 
   
   
7.   SIP Considerations

  When SIP proxies forward CNAM data retrieved by this mechanism to 
  other SIP elements, it should be transported using P-asserted 
  identity fields as defined in RFC 3325 [15] 
   
 
8.   Security Considerations                                            
   
  DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database.  Thus, an 
  implementation of this Enumservice that uses e164.apra or any other 
  publicly accessible domain means that the information stored there is 
  visible to anyone anonymously.  While this is not qualitatively 
  different from publication in a Telephone Directory, it does open or 
  ease access to such data without any indication that such data has 
  been accessed or who has accessed it. 
   
  The CNAM enumservice defined in this document is assumed to be used 
  in an environment where elements are trusted and where attackers are 
  not supposed to have access to the protocol messages between those   
  elements.  Traffic protection between network elements is sometimes   
  achieved by using IPSec and sometimes by physically protecting the 
  underlying network.  In any case, it is presumed the environment 
  where the CNAM request-response mechanism will be used can ensure the 
  integrity and the confidentiality of the contents of the CNAM data. 
   
  Carriers, service providers, or other organizations that originate 
  Calling Name data may choose not to publish such information in a 
  globally visible DNS tree for reasons of personal privacy protection. 
  Service providers and other organizations may choose to privately 
  exchange and publish this data in their internal cached ENUM 
  databases, which is only able to be queried by trusted elements of 
  their network, such as soft switches and SIP proxy servers. 
     
  An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS 
  and the applicability of DNSSEC [A] to this is provided in RFC 3761 
  [1].  A thorough analysis of threats to the DNS itself is covered in 
  RFC 3833 [B]. 
   
   
9.   Privacy Considerations                                        

  This document does not take into consideration issues of privacy as 
  it relates to Personally Identifying Information transmitted over IP 
  networks.  Service providers using this query response technique are 
  advised that many national jurisdictions have strict regulations on 
  the use of Calling Name data and that National Regulatory Authorities 
  may have special regulations that permit subscribers to block the use 
  of such data before call setup.  Other jurisdictions have services 
  known as anonymous caller rejection, meaning that calls made from a
